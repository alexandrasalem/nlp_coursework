period, will be shown in Taiwan next week. The film allows the international
community and the Taiwanese people to understand the difficult process of
Taiwan's democratization.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwanese tennis player Lu Yen-hsun said Friday that he doesn't expect a foot
injury to affect his performance at upcoming tournaments in the U.S.</P>
      <P>Lu arrived in Washington Friday afternoon for the Legg Mason Tennis Classic, a
late-summer tournament on the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) Tour.</P>
      <P>Prior to that, he was in Germany for an intensive 10-day training regimen in
Offenbach, just outside Frankfurt. Lu's official website said that while
training he experienced tendinitis of the sole.</P>
      <P>Lu said the problem was probably because his feet were not able to adapt to the
heavy training very well, particularly right after a rest period. He still
expressed hope that he can play well at the Legg Mason Classic.</P>
      <P>"It's been a while since I played a formal match. The most important  thing  for
me right now is to get back into the match-playing mindset, " said Lu, who will
play his first game at the Legg Mason on Aug. 2.</P>
      <P>Lu said his main focus was still the U.S. Open, the final grand slam of the
season to be held at the end of August in New York. He said he hoped to use the
Legg Mason and similar tournaments as warm-ups.</P>
      <P>"I may need a few matches to adapt and get back to my previous level," the 26
-year-old admitted.</P>
      <P>At his first match of the Legg Mason, Lu, currently ranked No. 44 in the world,
will meet Alejandro Falla (No. 65) from Colombia. If he wins, he will compete
against Australia's Lleyton Hewitt (30), seeded 11th in the tournament.</P>
      <P>Lu said that although his German coach Dirk Hordorff will not be able to come to
the U.S. this week, his athletic trainer would come from Taiwan to help treat
his feet.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Talk of the day -- China's missile overture</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>07/31/10  14:29:14
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A spokesman for China's Defense Ministry said Friday that "everything can be
discussed" between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait when negotiating the
establishment of a military trust mechanism, including removing the missiles
aimed at Taiwan.</P>
      <P>This was the first overture of its kind by China's military to Taiwan, which
observers said is an indication that Beijing is ready to negotiate with Taiwan
about the issue.</P>
      <P>The Taipei-based Ministry of National Defense (MND) said China's offer to remove
missiles was not very meaningful, while the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) and
the MND formed a joint task force to explore the military trust mechanism issue
for internal reference.</P>
      <P>Following are excerpts from reports that appeared in leading newspapers:</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>According to Richard Fisher, a U.S. expert on China's military, the number of
missiles deployed by the People's Liberation Army targeting Taiwan has increased
by about a hundred every year over the past decade.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a news conference in Beijing to reporters, China's Defense Ministry
spokesman Geng Yansheng said, "We have been calling for official bilateral talks
to end the state of hostility between the two sides based on the 'one China
principle, ' and to forge a peace agreement."</P>
      <P>"To stabilize the situation and reduce military misgivings in the Taiwan Strait,
both sides can conduct exchanges in terms of military issues by beginning with
setting up a cross-strait military trust mechanism," he said.</P>
      <P>The Presidential Office was reluctant to respond to the Chinese military's
offer, while ranking government sources said the missile removal proposal alone
is "not enough."</P>
      <P>Presidential Office spokesman Lo Chih-chiang said the Ministry of National
Defense and the Mainland Affairs Council are in the position to respond to the
missile issue, while political sources said it is impossible that the government
will yield to the "one China" principle.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, national security authorities are keeping a close watch on the
"unusual proposition" from China.</P>
      <P>Chang Jung-kung, director of the ruling Kuomintang's mainland affairs
department, called it a "positive development" that means Beijing has begun
taking a pragmatic approach to handling cross- strait ties, including mulling
the possibility of removing missiles aimed at Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In a recent speech at the half-way mark of his term, President Ma Ying-jeou did
not rule out the feasibility of discussing a framework for a military trust
mechanism or of a peace accord, but he cautioned that the time is not yet ripe
and said there is no set timetable. (July 31, 2010).</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>Since President Ma took office in May 2008, Taiwan has actively been engaged in
enhancing stability and cementing peace in the strait, the MAC said. Therefore,
the Chinese communists must abandon their military threat and dismantle  their
military deployment targeting  Taiwan  before the two sides can develop  a sound
relationship and build mutual trust.</P>
      <P>In the current stage, Taiwan and China should focus their exchanges on economic
affairs, the MAC said.</P>
      <P>Huang Chieh-cheng, a China expert and a professor at Tamkang University who
visited China in mid-July, said that China may feel a sense of urgency toward
the issue of setting up a cross-strait military trust mechanism, but that it
does not have a fixed timetable.</P>
      <P>Huang said Beijing understands that Taiwan is a different society where the
ruling camp needs to heed the opinion of the opposition, so it realizes that the
delicate cross-strait issues cannot be tackled overnight. (July 31, 2010).</P>

    <HEADLINE>Economic Daily News: WTO, FTAs should receive equal attention</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>07/31/10  14:37:08
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Owing to the delay of multi-lateral Doha negotiations, the World Trade
Organization (WTO) has been almost forgotten by all sectors. This situation has
led to the booming development of bilateral or regional free trade agreements
(FTAs).</P>
      <P>However, Taiwan's recent win over Europe in a trade dispute at the WTO
demonstrates that the negotiation delay has not undermined the WTO's dominating
position in the global trade network.</P>
      <P>In recent years, Taiwan's involvement in the WTO has been decreasing, with
almost all resources going toward the signing of the economic cooperation
framework agreement with China and FTAs with other trade partners.</P>
      <P>We suggest that the government attach equal importance to the WTO and seek to
balance the distribution of resources. The government should pay attention to
issues that have the most direct impact on Taiwan and become actively involved
in their negotiations in order to uphold the country's interests. (Editorial

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih urged Beijing Saturday to acknowledge the existence of the
Republic of China to allow for the peaceful development of cross-Taiwan Strait
relations.</P>
      <P>Wu rejected a proposal put forward a day earlier by China's Ministry of Defense
that issues concerning the removal of missiles targeting Taiwan can be discussed
under the "one China" precondition.</P>
      <P>"We cannot agree to that, " Wu told reporters during a trip to Taichung County.</P>
      <P>According to the premier, any such issues should be discussed under the
principles of "no unification, no independence, no use of force" and China's
acceptance of ROC sovereignty.</P>
      <P>Also commenting on the issue, opposition Democratic Progressive Party Chairwoman
Tsai Ing-wen said she could not feel any goodwill from Beijing in its latest
overture because "the `one China' principle is unacceptable to most people in
Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Tsai also said that any offer China might make to remove the missiles would be
"of little significance, " pointing out that the missiles in question are highly
mobile and could simply be redeployed very quickly at any time.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwanese artist uses mermaid to spread climate message</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>07/31/10  16:39:57</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>"The fate of my country rests in your hands, " said Ian Fry, the Tuvaluan
delegate to the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen, Denmark
last year. Television images of him tearfully pleading for legally binding
agreements to fight climate change shocked Taiwanese artist Vincent J.F. Huang.</P>
      <P>Huang, 39, decided to use his profession to help raise awareness about the small
Pacific country of Tuvalu, which faces rising sea levels that threaten to make
it one of the first victims of global warming.</P>
      <P>On the afternoon of July 17 on Funafuti, the main island of Tuvalu, Huang and
two assistants waded out to a reef to erect a small sculpture of a desiccated
mermaid made of dried coconut shells and scraggly pieces of palm trees. Later
swimming children circled the piece wearing fake shark fins.</P>
      <P>"The installation art of the dried Little Mermaid represented the failure of the
Copenhagen climate summit. It is surrounded by sharks, a metaphor for the big
powers, " Huang told the Central News Agency back in Taipei, adding that waves
repeatedly battered the artwork, resulting in its partial destruction.</P>
      <P>After exhibiting the work for about an hour, Huang burned the piece -- titled
"Den lille havfrue" after "The Little Mermaid" statue in Denmark's capital --
and collected the ashes in preparation for the next phase of his project.</P>
      <P>"I will take ashes to England, the place where the industrial revolution began,"
he vowed.</P>
      <P>While the eco art project may have been the first of its kind in Tuvalu, taking
on serious issues isn't new to Huang.</P>
      <P>"An artist can also do something for the world; I learned this while pursuing my
master's degree at Robert Gordon University in Aberdeen, Scotland 10 years ago,"
he said.</P>
      <P>Huang has struck a chord and gained international media attention with works
like his gruesome but poignant sculpture of a polar bear holding U.S. President
Barack Obama's severed head in its mouth, and his Suicide Penguins series that
finds the birds hanging from nooses in public places ranging from Taipei to
London. Polar bears and penguins recur in Huang's work; like Tuvaluans, their
homes are in danger.</P>
      <P>Climate change is not exclusive to any single nation or living creature, Huang
said. It does not discriminate.</P>
      <P>"Tuvalu will encounter the problem first, which is not fair, since it is a non-
industrialized nation where people live a primitive and simple life, but they
have to pay for the failed policies of other countries," he pointed out.</P>
      <P>Huang's next plan for the Polynesian island is "Balefire Project in Tuvalu, " in
which he plans to apply an ancient Chinese practice to spread his message.</P>
      <P>Huang said that he will burn local dried coconut shells along the coast of
Funafuti during the day, creating old-fashioned distress signals. A more modern
version will continue at night, when he plans to aim about 50 green laser lights
into the sky from several locations around the island.</P>
      <P>The artist said he is planning the project for the end of August, but his work
won't stop there.</P>
      <P>"After finishing this piece, I will continue with another project during the
Mexico climate change summit to be held at the end of November," he said.</P>
      <P>"I plan to draw the attention of the world to the problem of this island
(Tuvalu) , and enable people to work together to protect the earth, which is
home to all of us," he added. By Sunnie Chen, CNA staff reporter CNA photo nos.

      <P>An environmental group took Chiayi County and the Cabinet-level Council of
Agriculture (COA) to task Saturday, accusing them of condoning the trading of
protected animals and questioning if Customs authorities are involved in the
smuggling into Taiwan of bear paws.</P>
      <P>Chen Yu-min, director of the Environment and Animal Society of Taiwan (EAST) ,
said that a restaurant in Chiayi County's Meishan Village has long advertised
bear paw as its signature dish.</P>
      <P>A day earlier, Chen blew the whistle on the Chuanyuan Villa, saying that two
protected animals -- a Malay sun bear and a highly endangered Formosan black
bear -- were being kept in cages there. The sun bear had already died, while the
black bear required immediate care.</P>
      <P>Chen said that Lin Heng-yi, the son of the villa's owner, Lin Chin-hsiu,  told
undercover  EAST members who traveled to the restaurant to investigate that he
usually obtains his bear paws from aboriginal people.</P>
      <P>However, she said that EAST was informed that the villa had been offering dishes
made from various protected species for more than two decades and that Lin does
not only rely on aboriginal people for his bear paws, but also smuggles them
from Myanmar, Vietnam and China.</P>
      <P>Chen demanded a probe to see if Customs officials have been involved in the
illicit trade.</P>
      <P>In response,  a COA official said the number of wildlife conservation officials
is limited and that they will have to ask local governments to step up their
fight against the outdated practice.</P>
      <P>Lin Kuo-chang, chief of the Wildlife Conservation Section of COA's Forestry
Bureau, noted that there are "only six members" in charge of wildlife
conservation in the Forestry Bureau and that the Chiayi county government is
still the local authority in charge of wildlife conservation.</P>
      <P>As for the smuggling allegations, the Coast Guard Administration is responsible
for cracking down on smuggled agricultural and fishery products, live animals,
tobacco and alcohol, according to Lin.</P>
      <P>He also noted that according to the Wildlife Conservation Law, the country's
aboriginal people can apply to hunt animals, including protected onces, but are
forbidden from selling or buying them.</P>
      <P>Illegal hunters of protected animals, irrespective of whether they are
aboriginal people or not, face prison terms of between six months and five
years, and fines of over NT$200,000 (US$6,230)</P>
      <P>People trading in protected species, whether they are aboriginal people or not,
can be sentenced to between six months and five years and can be fined between
NT$300,000 and NT$1.5 million.</P>

      <P>A Hong Kong business tycoon has unveiled a new news channel on the Internet
featuring animated news stories after the Taiwanese government put on hold his
application for a TV news channel due to distaste for his well-known
sensationalist style.</P>
      <P>Jimmy Lai's Next TV also made its debut Internet broadcast on big screens in 20
busy shopping areas in the cities of Taipei, Taichung and Kaohsiung Friday.</P>
      <P>Some speculated that Lai's move was aimed at demonstrating to Taiwan's  official
media watchdog,  the National Communications Commission (NCC) , and its other
critics, how Next TV reports can appeal to audiences without resorting to
sensationalism.</P>
      <P>Lai has failed in three attempts to obtain NCC approval for his news channel.</P>
      <P>On July 28,  the NCC approved  only Lai's sports channel application while
putting on hold again his applications for three other channels -- news, general

      <P>Asked to comment on Next TV's debut,  NCC spokesman Chen Jeng-chang told CNA in
a telephone interview Saturday that the NCC is monitoring the content of Next
TV's news programs for future licensing review and will issue fines if it
violates the law by broadcasting inappropriate footage.</P>
      <P>However, NCC officials considered the content of Next TV's debut news programs
to be similar to those carried by other TV stations, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Lai said earlier this week that he is aware of the concerns that his TV station
will air sensationalist animated news reports, like those that once appeared  on
the website of Apple Daily,  a Chinese-language newspaper that is also part of
Lai's media group.</P>
      <P>Several civic groups voiced strong protest against Apply Daily's animated
reports on sexual assaults and domestic violence in November 2009, prompting the
newspaper to apologize and promise to change its stance.</P>
      <P>While many on the social website Plurk said they liked Next TV's debut animation
effects, two local journalism professors were quoted in an Apple Daily report
Saturday as saying that Next TV's overall debut reports were not impressive.</P>
      <P>Lai had previously vowed that his TV outlet will tell news stories in an image-
based and interesting manner, which is contrary to what he described as "boring"
stories broadcast by other TV stations that are text-based.</P>
      <P>"Now is the image era. People under the age of 40 use images to communicate and
absorb information, " Lai told a group of web media workers and bloggers during
a visit to the Next TV office in Taipei July 28.</P>
      <P>"The biggest challenge we are facing today is how to use a great many images to
tell a story," he said.</P>
      <P>Although he has not been granted channel licenses, Lai has put a considerable
amount of investment and resources into getting his TV station ready.</P>
      <P>So far, Lai has recruited more than 500 people including anchors, reporters,
editors and animation specialists for Next TV and has spent NT$100 million
(US$3.1 million) every month for the past six months.</P>
      <P>Several senior news journalists predicted last year that the launch of Next TV
is likely to create a big impact on local TV stations, similar to the impact
Apple Daily had on local newspapers when it was launched in Taiwan in 2003.</P>
      <P>In the first few months following its launch, Apply Daily engaged other major
newspapers in a fierce price-cutting war. Some of the newspapers also changed
their layout designs to resemble that of image-focused Apple Daily.</P>
      <P>Apple Daily has also beaten other major newspapers in Taiwan to be rated as the
most ideal newspaper for five years in a row, according to a survey released in
May by Taiwan's Yahoo News.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Over 20 universities plan to open branches on Kinmen</HEADLINE>

      <P>More than 20 Taiwanese universities are planning to set up branches on the
outlying island of Kinmen in preparation for the admission of Chinese students,
a Kinmen official said Saturday.</P>
      <P>According to Li Tsai-hang, chief of the county's education bureau, Kinmen is an
ideal location for such students because it is situated near China and the
schools on the Taiwan-controlled island will not be subject to enrollment quotas
for Chinese students.</P>
      <P>The county government will provide 2.5 hectares of land for use by the
universities, Li told reporters in a forum held as part of celebrations to mark
the upgrading of National Kinmen Institute of Technology to a university.</P>
      <P>Also speaking at the event, Ho Cho-fei, director-general of the Department of
Higher Education under the Ministry of Education (MOE), explained that Taiwanese
universities and colleges will be permitted to recruit Chinese students after
the University Act, Junior College Law, and the Statute Governing the Relations
between the People of the Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area are amended.</P>
      <P>If the proposed amendments clear the Legislative Yuan in its next special
session in August, Chinese students will be able to enroll in doctorate programs
in Taiwan in March 2011 at the earliest, but will have to wait until September
2011 to enroll in bachelor degree programs, Ho said.</P>
      <P>According to rules drafted by the MOE to govern the entry and length of stay of
Chinese students in Taiwan, Ho said, the number of Chinese students admitted by
Taiwanese universities cannot exceed 1 percent, or around 2,000, of the total
enrollment.</P>
      <P>This quota restriction, however, will not apply to outlying islands such as
Kinmen and Penghu, Ho went on. In these areas, Chinese student enrollment
programs  will be conducted  on a case-by-case basis, he explained.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Kinmen Magistrate Li Wo-shi said the county government will provide
scholarships to attract top Chinese students to study on Kinmen, even though
universities in Taiwan are prohibited from doing so.</P>
      <P>After the National Kinmen Institute of Technology is upgraded to a university
Aug. 1, the top 20 students in each class will be granted full tuition and fee
waivers, Li said.</P>
      <P>In addition, the tuition aid and transportation allowance for every student will
be raised from NT$14,000 to NT$20,000, he added.</P>

      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih ordered Saturday that Formosa Petrochemical Corp. submit an
investigation report on Aug. 6 detailing reasons behind a recent fire at its
Mailiao oil refinery in Yunlin County and plans for improvement.</P>
      <P>"Formosa Petrochemical's No. 6 naphtha cracker plant in Mailiao will not be
allowed to re-open unless the cause of the fire is discovered and operating
safety is fully guaranteed, " Wu said while on an inspection tour of the
Taichung area in central Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Wu said the Council of Labor Affairs will invite academics to take part in the
review, following a suggestion by Yunlin County Magistrate Su Chih-fen.</P>
      <P>"The most important thing for now is to mitigate the damage of the fire,
regardless of political affiliation in central and local governments," Wu said,
adding that "everyone knows very clearly which party was in power in the central
government from 2000-2008."</P>
      <P>The fire at the company's No. 6 naphtha cracker plant on July 25 -- the second
fire in a month -- provoked anger from local residents, but the premier praised
the handling of the incident by both the Yunlin County government and Formosa
Petrochemical.</P>
      <P>"Both have properly dealt with the fire," he said.</P>
      <P>Wu inspected the facility Friday and ordered the plant to remain closed.
Operations have been suspended since the fire broke out.</P>
      <P>It is estimated Formosa Petrochemical could suffer losses of about NT$20 billion
monthly while the plant is shut, undermining the profits of its affiliates.</P>
      <P>Formosa Petrochemical Chairman Wang Wen-yuan made a public apology on Friday,
offering assurances that his company will take good care of the problem and
issue compensation where necessary.</P>
      <P>Commenting on a Taipei High Administrative Court ruling Friday that an expansion
project at the Central Taiwan Science Park in Erlin Township, Changhua County be
shelved temporarily due to environmental concerns, the premier said he will ask
government agencies to review the issue.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) approved the
project last November after it passed an environment impact assessment. Erlin
residents filed an appeal with the Taipei High Administrative Court, however,
asking that the project be halted or scrapped because of EPA negligence in the
assessment. The court ruled in their favor.</P>
      <P>The panel of judges said the ruling was not a final verdict, but a contingency
measure to safeguard the interests of local farmers who are losing land because
of the science park expansion.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Yunlin Magistrate Su Chih-fen led fishermen in her south-central county in a
protest in front of the Executive Yuan after two fires hit a sprawling
petrochemical complex in less than one month. Su went down on her knees, begging
Premier Wu Den-yih to take full political responsibility for the industrial
disaster.</P>
      <P>Wu traveled to the county's Mailiao Township the next day in a gesture to show
the government's resolve to iron out controversies over industrial safety in the
Formosa Plastics Group's naphtha cracker complex and the possible hazards to
fishermen's stocks and residents' health due to water and air pollution caused
by the complex.</P>
      <P>Su's subservience to Wu, however, has distorted the nature of the industrial
accidents and has also made light of responsible politics.</P>
      <P>In modern politics, even the common masses should not need to beg to officials
by kneeling. Su's gesture did not befit her status as a county chief and served
only as a wrong demonstration that reminded the public of the meaningless shows
put on by politicians.</P>
      <P>In the face of major industrial mishaps, both the central and local governments
have responsibilities to bear and rights to institute. Putting on political
shows or throwing dead clams and oysters might have spooked the ruling
Kuomintang, but it was an out-of-date joke in the eyes of the Taiwanese public.

      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih said over the weekend that the government will not insist on
expropriating a plot of farmland for the fourth-phase expansion of the Central
Taiwan Science Park (CTSP) as long as the region's sewer and traffic systems are
not affected.</P>
      <P>Wu's remarks came after the Taipei High Administrative Court ruled Friday that
the CTSP expansion plan should be shelved until an environmental impact
assessment dispute is resolved.</P>
      <P>The controversy arose mainly as a result of protests by residents in
Siangsihliao community in Changhua County's Erlin Township over a local
government plan to expropriate their farmland to make way for the science park
expansion project.</P>
      <P>The premier said during a community outreach tour in Taichung County that he has
directed the CTSP Administration to conduct an overview of the issue and come up
with a feasible solution.</P>
      <P>"The government will be more than willing to respect Siangsihliao residents'
intention to continue their farming careers as long as stopping the
expropriation of their land plots will not impact the park area's traffic and
sewer systems," Wu said.</P>
      <P>The premier's statement drew attention to whether the Cabinet will put into
practice President Ma Ying-jeou's recent declaration that environmental
protection will be a policy priority.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from the local news coverage of the issue:</P>
      <P>Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>CTSP Administration Director Yang Wen-ke said the court ruling on suspending the
park's Erlin expansion project will defer major investment projects in the
complex, including construction of a new AU Optronics (AUO) flat panel factory
there.</P>
      <P>Of the 335 hectares of land that form the CTSP's Erlin complex, 200 hectares are
to be designated to house the new AUO plant, Yang said.</P>
      <P>"All major companies intending to launch new investment projects in the complex
are concerned about the administrative court's latest ruling and we are seeking
a way out," Yang said.</P>
      <P>According to Yang, his office has begun communications with Siangsihliao
residents and has informed them of a detailed community relocation project.</P>
      <P>"We hope the residents will give us a response in two weeks and we will fully
respect  their wish in dealing  with follow-up arrangements," he added. (Aug. 1,
2010).</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>Commenting  on the court ruling,  Environmental  Protection Administration (EPA)
Minister Stephen Shu-hung Shen said the verdict has dealt a heavy blow to the
country's 16-year-old environmental impact assessment system.</P>
      <P>The EPA already gave the green light to the CTSP's Erlin expansion project last
November after it passed an environmental impact assessment.</P>
      <P>"The court has found fault with the wrong target, because at issue in the CTSP
dispute is land expropriation rather than the project's impact on the natural
environment, " Shen said, adding that the ruling is tantamount to denying the
EPA's role in environmental protection.</P>
      <P>Shen said the EPA will discuss the issue with legal experts of relevant
government agencies before deciding how to respond to the ruling.  The
Siangsihliao land expropriation dispute has again highlighted the dilemma of
balancing environmental protection and economic development.</P>
      <P>The controversy follows a spate of similar conflicts reported in recent months
that include famous essayist Chang Hsiao-feng asking Ma to suspend a plan to
transform part of a 185-hectare largely undeveloped  military  complex  into a
biotechnology  park and environmentalists raising funds to buy up a planned site
for a new petrochemical complex in order to protect a rare dolphin species
living there.</P>
      <P>After residents in Dapu Township in Miaoli County staged an overnight sit-in at
the Presidential Office Square in July against the county government's forced
expropriation of their farmland to accommodate an industrial park development
project, Ma announced his determination to prioritize ecological conservation.</P>
      <P>All these events, coupled with violent protests by residents of Yunlin County's
Mailiao Township over two fires in July at Formosa Petrochemical Corp.'s Mailiao
naphtha cracking and oil refining complex, betray ever-more serious conflicts
between environmental protection and economic development, political analysts
said, adding that the government should show mettle and wisdom to tackle the
issue properly. (Aug. 1, 2010).</P>

      <P>The Sindian Land Office in northern Taiwan's Taipei County will resume issuing
paper certificates of title from Aug. 2 based on environmental considerations,
office chief Chuang Yue-kuei said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The office will stop issuing plastic certificates, but plastic certificates
previously issued will remain valid and holders will not be asked to replace
them with paper ones, Chuang said.</P>
      <P>In an effort to increase anti-counterfeiting efforts, the Taipei county
government began using plastic certificates in 2002, Chuang said, noting that
the advantages of this form of certificate includes more convenience  for
document maintenance,  waterproofing  and dirtproofing, and providing enhanced
anti-forgery functions.</P>
      <P>But in light of the fact that waste plastic certificates generate toxic gas and
harm the environment when they are incinerated, the county government decided to
stop issuing them and to reintroduce paper ones, according to Chuang.</P>
      <P>He added that although the anti-moisture and anti-bug effectiveness of the paper
certificates are not comparable to those of their plastic counterparts, the
paper documents, to be produced by the Central Engraving and Printing Plant,
will still have multiple anti-counterfeiting measures.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile that day, the Danshui Land Office said it will launch new services
allowing local citizens to apply for documents from their vehicles at a
designated service zone.</P>
      <P>By making a prior appointment with the office, local citizens can apply in their
cars for replicas of land and building registration certificates, cadastral maps

      <P>The Council for Cultural Affairs (CCA) will donate four hand puppets to the

      <P>The four puppets are the Scholar Warrior Shih Yan-wen, Hidden Mirror Man and the

      <P>The president of Xiamen University cited National Taiwan University (NTU) Sunday
as the best university in China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau with its solid
academic foundation and innovation research.</P>
      <P>NTU maintains a close connection with the pulse of Taiwanese society and plays a
role in boosting social and economic development in Taiwan, Zhu Chongshi said on
the Taiwan-held outlying island of Kinmen, where celebrations were held Sunday
to mark the upgrading of National Kinmen Institute of Technology to a
university.</P>
      <P>Zhu noted, meanwhile, that China's universities have progressed fast as well.
"They will catch up (with NTU) before long, " he predicted.</P>
      <P>On the Kinmen technology institute's upgrading, he said the new university, to
be known as National Quemoy University, has great potential to become a top-
notch school with the support of National Cheng Kung University in Tainan,
southern Taiwan, in addition to Kinmen's long cultural and educational legacy.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, he drummed up support for a Taiwanese government plan to allow
Chinese students to study in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Noting that a great many Taiwanese companies have invested in China, with the
number exceeding 10,000 in Fujian Province alone, he forecast that Chinese
students being allowed to study in Taiwan will eventually be helpful to those
Taiwanese companies operating in China.</P>
      <P>In related news, Kinmen's Education Bureau said a day earlier that more than 20
Taiwanese universities are planning to set up branches on Kinmen in preparation
for the admission of Chinese students.</P>
      <P>Kinmen is an ideal location for such students because it is situated near China
and Kinmen schools will not be subject to the enrollment quotas for Chinese
students that will be in place for universities on Taiwan proper, said bureau
chief Li Tsai-hang.</P>

      <P>A proposed second-generation National Health Insurance (NHI) program became the
main topic of discussion Sunday during a ceremony to mark the changeover of the
head of the Bureau of National Health Insurance (BNHI).</P>
      <P>Department of Health (DOH) Minister Yaung Chih-liang expressed regret during the
ceremony that the second-generation NHI program has yet to be approved by the
Legislative Yuan, adding that more needs to be done to push for the program's
legislation.</P>
      <P>For her part, new BNHI Director-General Day Guey-ing said the program will be
the biggest challenge facing her in her new job.</P>
      <P>Day said she will listen and watch to get a feel for what the public needs after
assuming the post.</P>
      <P>Yuang thanked Day for taking the job, saying that Day, the first female head
since the reorganization of the BNHI, had originally planned to retire.</P>
      <P>Day has previously served as a BNHI Taipei branch manager, director of the DOH's
planning division, and a DOH section manager.</P>
      <P>Yaung reportedly appointed Day to the post because as a major planner of the
first version of plans for the second-generation NHI program, she is familiar
with relevant issues.</P>
      <P>During the ceremony, Yaung also said he hopes the BNHI will address the range of
challenges and problems it faces. For example, the BNHI should collaborate with
the DOH to create an environment for fair competition among physicians and
hospitals.</P>
      <P>The outgoing BNHI head, Cheng Shou-hsia, who will return to his teaching
position at National Taiwan University's College of Public Health, thanked Yaung
for his support during his stint and expressed hope that the second-generation
NIH program will soon clear the legislature.</P>
      <P>The second-generation NHI refers to a new scheme of calculating premiums based
on total household incomes rather than the existing system, which considers only
individuals' salaries and wages.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Staying away from disaster: President</HEADLINE>

(By Wang Shu-feng and Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Staying away from disaster is the most important work in disaster prevention,
President Ma Ying-jeou said in Kaohsiung Sunday while summing up the lessons his
administration learned the hard way from Typhoon Morakot last August.</P>
      <P>In a forum organized to mark the approaching Aug. 8 anniversary of the typhoon,
which cut a wide swathe of destruction through southern Taiwan, the president
said his administration will now concentrate on "preparing in advance, deploying
before disaster."</P>
      <P>The president, whose approval rate dipped to a nadir because of his
administration's slow and disordered response in the wake of Morakot, said the
government's relief operation was 10 times faster than the response to the Sept.
21, 1999 earthquake in some ways, but his administration came under fire anyway.</P>
      <P>Noting that relief operators could not reach some of the disaster areas
immediately because the bad weather made it impossible for helicopters  to land,
which stoked public  criticism  of his government's slow response, the president
said that even deities can hardly do anything in that kind of situation.</P>
      <P>However, he went on, some disasters can be prevented, adding that disaster-
prevention experts and volunteers from the Soil and Water Conservation Bureau
under the Council of Agriculture will alert residents in mudslide-prone areas to
evacuate in the event of danger, which will prevent casualties.</P>
      <P>Officials encouraged residents in areas prone to mudslides to evacuate before
Morakot, "but they did not do enough, " Ma admitted. Morakot triggered
widespread flooding and mudslides unseen in five decades in Taiwan,  causing 619
deaths and leaving 76 people unaccounted for.</P>
      <P>Evacuations were carried out more thoroughly when Typhoon Parma barrelled
through the island Oct.  5 that same year,  which significantly cut down the
number of casualties, the president said.</P>
      <P>"Better safe than sorry, " the president continued, adding that evacuations for
typhoons that turn out to be no more than breezes are better than taking the
risk of large-scale loss of life.</P>
      <P>He urged the participants to the forum, notably the magistrates of the counties
hard-hit by Morakot, to be vigilant whenever there are typhoon warnings and to
take action accordingly.</P>
      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih, who took office after former Premier Liu Chao-shiuan stepped
down to take the blame for the government's bungled post-Morakot relief
operations, lauded the Legislative Yuan for approving a bill to facilitate the
post-typhoon reconstruction.</P>
      <P>He also noted the Legislative Yuan's approval of an Executive Yuan request to
transfer the National Fire Agency under the Ministry of the Interior to the
Disaster Prevention and Protection Agency to speed up future disaster relief
operations.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FTA with Taiwan unnecessary: Thai rep office</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Goods imported from Thailand to Taiwan already enjoy a favorable tariff
treatment, hence a free trade agreement (FTA) or a similar mechanism is not
necessary to stimulate bilateral trade, the Thai representative office said
recently.</P>
      <P>In an interview with CNA, Porpot Chagyawa, the head of the Economic Affairs
Section of the Thailand Trade and Economic Office in Taipei, acknowledged that
Taiwan has been seeking to sign FTAs or similar trade pacts with its major
trading partners, including Thailand.</P>
      <P>However, Thai exports to Taiwan already enjoy low to zero tariff treatment, so
an FTA is not imperative, she said.</P>
      <P>The global economic downturn affected bilateral trade in 2009, she noted, but
the momentum has picked up this year and it is considered robust at present.</P>
      <P>According to the Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA) , Thailand
is Taiwan's 12th-largest export market. In 2009, the total volume of exports to
Thailand stood at US$3.82 billion, a 22-percent drop compared to the previous
year.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is Thailand 11th-biggest trading partner and 18th-largest export market.
Taiwanese businessmen are the third-largest group of foreign investors in
Thailand, with combined investments of US$12.5 billion. The figure, however, is
on the decline, according to TAITRA.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has long been eyeing an FTA with Thailand, hoping that such a pact will
give it a foot in the door of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN).</P>
      <P>The Nation, a Thai daily, recently quoted Berton Chiu, director of the economic
division of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in Thailand, as saying that
Taiwanese investors are pining for an FTA with Thailand as a means of increasing
their competitiveness in third markets.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the government and its supporters have lauded the recently signed
economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) with Beijing as a catalyst for
Taiwan to increase its presence in the Southeast Asian market and hope the
cross-Taiwan Strait trade pact will encourage other countries to forge similar
deals with Taiwan, said TAITRA.</P>
      <P>Chagayawa said that according to her office's initial assessment, the ECFA
presents a minimal effect on Taiwan-Thailand trade ties.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>should prioritize the problems arising from the dominance of foreign private
equity funds in local cable television systems after it formally begins
operations Monday.</P>
      <P>Because of the Cable TV Act's unreasonably loose restrictions on foreign stakes
in cable TV systems, the top three of Taiwan's five multiple cable system
operators are foreign private equity funds.</P>
      <P>Taiwan might hope that foreign investors will bring capital, technical know-how
and management expertise into the local cable TV market. Such hopes, however,
have proved to be unrealistic.</P>
      <P>Foreign equity funds need not use much of their own money to buy up local cable
TV systems and have instead borrowed from local banks. Although the NCC asked
them to trim their bank loans, the fund managers resisted the demand under the
cover of the free economy.</P>
      <P>As private equity funds tend to withdraw from a market in three to five years
after realizing their profit targets, they tend to be reluctant to make any
long-term management reforms, far less invest in digital technology as required
by the government. Consequently, digitization in Taiwan's cable TV systems is
less than 5 percent, a ratio that even lags behind the levels of many developing
countries.</P>
      <P>High profitability in Taiwan's cable TV industry has lured foreign equity funds
into the local market in recent years. After realizing their profit targets,
they are now seeking to sell off their holdings to squeeze out the maximum
possible gains. The new NCC should face up to this problem and work out response
strategies. (Editorial abstract -- Aug. 1, 2010).</P>

on Kinmen Sunday, drawing a crowd of officials and educators from Taiwan proper,
as well as philanthropist business tycoons from home and abroad.</P>
      <P>The university is an upgrade of the National Kinmen Institute of Technology,

      <P>The Ministry of the Interior (MOI) is planning to organize four public hearings
and seminars this month on the decriminalization of adult sex transactions,
ministry officials said Sunday.</P>
      <P>One of the hearings will be held in Taipei Aug. 2, with another in Kaohsiung
Aug. 31, while the schedules for the two seminars are yet to be decided,
according to the MOI.</P>
      <P>The public hearings and seminars are being organized after justices of the
Constitutional Court asserted last November that a provision in the Social Order
Maintenance Act allowing punishment for prostitutes but not their patrons is
unconstitutional and must be invalidated within two years.</P>
      <P>The assertion has forced the Executive Yuan to face the issue, as it must come
up with measures within two years to not only revise the law but also to
establish a set of rules governing adult sex transactions.</P>
      <P>Areas likely to be tackled during the first public hearing will include whether
sex transactions with the consent of both parties involved should be banned or
punished and whether places where adult sex deals are made should be regulated
after prostitution is decriminalized or legalized.</P>
      <P>Topics such as should prostitutes and sex trade businesses register and apply
for official approval before launching their businesses, and should married
adults who use prostitutes face criminal proceedings on adultery charges, are
also expected to be discussed during the first hearing, MOI officials said.</P>
      <P>The  MOI  has  consulted  scholars  and  experts  on  the decriminalization
issues, but so far, no consensus has been reached on any area, including whether
red-light zones like the ones in Amsterdam and Hamburg will indeed appear in

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan grouper breeders see booming market after ECFA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>08/01/10  18:36:26</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A grouper breeder under a bright sun in Linbian Township, in southern Taiwan's
Pingtung County, works hard with an excavator to dredge the massive amount of
mud that silted up his ten-hectare pond during Typhoon Morakot last August, but
waves of excitement sweep over him thanks to the prospects of a huge Chinese
market worth up to NT$100 billion (US$3.1 billion) annually.</P>
      <P>He is not alone. Many grouper breeders in neighboring Chiatung and Tungkang
townships, who originally did not want to recover their damaged grouper farms,
are now busy rebuilding their ponds in the hope that they will be in time to
grab the market opportunity after groupers were listed as one of Taiwan's farm
items to be given zero tariff treatment in the cross-Taiwan Strait economic
cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) signed June 29.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Taiwan is set to become the world's largest grouper
producer, since its possesses the key factors -- breeding expertise, suitable
climate and proximity to China.</P>
      <P>Huang  Tsai-tuan,  chairman  of  the  Pingtung  Aquaculture Association, said
Taiwan produces 18,000 tons of groupers of various species worth NT$3.5 billion
(US$110 million) per year, 90 percent of which are shipped to Hong Kong and the
Chinese coastal provinces of Guangdong and Fujian just opposite Taiwan.</P>
      <P>ECFA will, among other thing, help Taiwan get into the grouper market in
Beijing, Shanghai and other parts of China with the increasingly strong consumer
power there, Huang said.</P>
      <P>Tai Kun-Tsai, who is dubbed "king of the groupers, " said that currently, nine
out of about the 200 species of groupers are successfully raised in aquaculture
ponds, with farming expertise for eight of them developed and controlled by
Taiwanese.</P>
      <P>Tai began raising leopard coral groupers, a high priced species, in Malaysia six
years ago, with all of his major markets in China. But now he is moving his
business back to Taiwan to take advantage of the shorter transport distance
between Taiwan and China, as well as the tariff benefits.</P>
      <P>"How can I miss the opportunity to make money since the market demand for
leopard coral grouper has been rising in Hong Kong and China, while supplies of
the fish from the Philippines and Australia has been declining."</P>
      <P>The market for leopard coral groupers has reached as high as NT$10 billion in
Hong Kong alone, not to mention the big cities in China, according to Tai, who
said his new farm in Pingtung's Fanliao Township will begin supplying 32,000
leopard coral groupers a year from now, earning him NT$32 million per year.</P>
      <P>On Ma's worries that Taiwan's unique expertise in raising groupers might be
stolen or reproduced by foreign competitors in China, Vietnam, Malaysia,
Thailand and Indonesia, a confident Huang said that "President Ma can rest easy,
as nowhere in the world is more suitable than Taiwan for raising groupers in
terms of climate."</P>
      <P>Temperatures are too high to raise groupers in most Southeast Asian counties,
while China can afford to raise the fish only in the period between June and
November as it is too cold for groupers during the rest of the year.</P>
      <P>In contrast,  Taiwan's climate allows groupers to be bred year-round, while the
country also has superior expertise in breeding the fish, Huang said.</P>
      <P>However, that does not necessarily mean that Taiwan's grouper farmers are on a
fast track to success without a hitch.</P>
      <P>Grouper breeders have long been troubled by indovirus and nervous necrosis virus
among their stocks, according to Huang and Tai.</P>
      <P>Huang said that Taiwan, which was once dubbed "the kingdom of the grass shrimp"
saw the complete collapse of its grass shrimp industry as result of viral
infection, and this time, viruses are threatening the grouper industry.</P>
      <P>"We (grouper breeders)  have successfully developed grouper breeding expertise
but we have no way of controlling viral infection but to seek help from relevant
government agencies, " Tai said.</P>
      <P>For his part, Council of Agriculture Minister Chen Wu-hsiung said the government
has stepped up efforts to develop vaccines against the viruses that have plagued
local grouper farmers for nearly a decade.</P>
      <P>Chen said the council's Fisheries Administration has appropriated NT$10.43
million to promote the development of the vaccines, while National Taiwan Ocean
University has also been given NT$10.5 million to conduct research on the
viruses and aquaculture technology.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that the viruses have long existed and that the COA activated an
inter-government agency project to develop vaccines about five years ago,
although none have yet been produced.</P>
      <P>"At present, there is a locally developed bio test kit that can detect if the
fish has been infected with virus, which operators can use to monitor and manage
their fish ponds," Chen added.</P>
      <P>"I believe that the grouper vaccine is just a step away and that by the time it
reaches the market, Taiwan will still have no competitors in the grouper
business," Huang said.</P>
      <P>For Tai, meanwhile, virus or no virus, the outlook for his business in Taiwan is
looking rosy,  with the advantages far outweighing the potential for disaster.

      <P>The conclusion of the economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) with China
is only the first course and the main course has not yet been served, President
Ma Ying-jeou said Sunday in Kaohsiung, southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In a forum with business leaders in Kaohsiung and neighboring Pingtung County,
the president told businessmen whose goods were not on the "early harvest" list
of Taiwanese goods to be exported to China with reduced or zero tariffs to be
patient, as more goods will be added to the list.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks in response to their demands for help from Ma's
administration to have their goods included on the list.</P>
      <P>"We will try our hardest in the coming negotiations to include more Taiwanese
goods on the list," the president promised.</P>
      <P>Accompanied by Minister of Economic Affairs Shih Yen-shiang, Ma said the trade
pact will not only prevent the country from being shunted  to the  sidelines  in
the  region,  but  will  also institutionalize Taiwan's trade with China and
speed up the country's integration with the rest of the world.</P>
      <P>"It will stand Taiwan in good stead while competing against other countries," he
said.</P>
      <P>However, Ma warned that the pact, which is a cornerstone of his China policy, is
not an elixir for all problems suffered by local businesses.</P>
      <P>During the ECFA negotiations, Ma said, his government honored its promises to
not allow entry of Chinese agricultural products or laborers, to shield weaker
local industries from competition from China, to promote protection of
intellectual property rights, and to refrain from compromising the country's
sovereignty in any way.</P>
      <P>One local businessman engaged in the production of alloys used for medical
purposes said at the forum that his company had canceled a plan to invest in
Thailand because of the conclusion of the ECFA.</P>
      <P>"Instead, I rented 10 hectares of land in Kaohsiung to expand our operations in
Taiwan in anticipation of booming business to be brought about by the pact."</P>
      <P>A fishery representative lauded the ECFA as a shot in the arm for local ocean
fishing operators, saying that there are 77 boats dedicated to fishing for
Pacific saury in Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>Their hauls of about 100,000 metric tons a year are well above Taiwan's demand
for 30,000 metric tons.</P>
      <P>"Thanks to the ECFA, we can now explore the Chinese market to sell the fish that
exceed local demand," he said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a farmer who raises groupers in Pingtung County said the pact will
enable him to sell live groupers to China more quickly.</P>
      <P>The farmer and the saury fishery representative presented a large live grouper
and a case of saury to the president at the forum to show their gratitude to the
government.</P>
      <P>The forum was part of the government's efforts to boost public support for the
ECFA, which is stuck in the Legislative Yuan after being submitted for approval.</P>
      <P>Local pro-independence groups led by the opposition Democratic Progressive Party
have vowed to scuttle it, saying that it will tie the country too closely to
China economically.</P>
      <P>After the forum, the president visited grouper farms in Yungan Township,
Kaohsiung County which uses cool water discharged from a nearby liquefied
natural gas plant to bring down the temperature of the water in their ponds,
which promotes the growth of the valuable fish.</P>
      <P>The plant uses seawater to raise the temperature of liquefied natural gas which
is brought to the plant at minus 162 degrees Celsius. The water, which is cooled
by this process, is discharged at a temperature of between 16 degrees Celsius
and 21 degrees Celsius into the sea.</P>
      <P>Grouper need to be kept at 22 degrees for optimal growth and the cooled water
from the plant has increased production at the farm by nearly 30 percent,
according to a local farmer.</P>
      <P>During his visit, the president was told by fishery officials that Taiwan
produces 25 percent of the world's farmed groupers, with a cash value of 58
percent of the world's total.</P>
      <P>The officials said the area occupied by grouper ponds is expected to expand from
200 hectares to 500 hectares by 2011 under the government's sponsorship.</P>

      <P>The Judicial Yuan should submit to the legislature a new bill governing judges
as soon as possible to provide better regulation and restore the credibility of
the battered judiciary, a ruling Kuomintang (KMT) lawmaker said Sunday.</P>
      <P>"The recent spate of corruption scandals involving judges has proved that self-
discipline  is not enough to ensure judicial rectitude, " said Legislator Chiu
Yi. "Strict legislation and more outside supervision are badly needed," he
added.</P>
      <P>On the legislation, Chiu said the Judicial Yuan has not come up with a new
version since its previous bill on judges was rejected by the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>"As the top supervisory body of courts and judges, the Judicial Yuan is
obligated to present a new version of the judges bill to the legislature for
enactment," Chiu said, adding that the Judicial Yuan should stop dragging its
feet on the issue.</P>
      <P>Without a Judicial Yuan-drafted bill, the legislature can do nothing to respond
to the public's demands for stricter judiciary regulations, Chiu said.</P>
      <P>On an appeal by Taiwan High Court judge Chen Heng-kuan for President Ma Ying-
jeou to call a national meeting on judicial reform, Chiu said that what matters
is action and mettle.</P>
      <P>Chen, an accompanying judge on a three-member panel that presided over the trial
of former Presidential Office Deputy Secretary-General Chen Che-nan at the
Taiwan High Court, resigned July 29 to protest the lenient sentence handed down
to Chen Che-nan. But he said Saturday he had changed his mind and dropped his
resignation decision.</P>
      <P>"My conscience told me to stay on and continue the fight for judicial reform, "
Chen Heng-kuan said, expressing hope that Ma will call a national meeting on
judicial reform to win back public trust in the judiciary.</P>
      <P>However, Chiu said that holding such a meeting might only generate  some media
coverage while achieving  nothing of any substance. He added that both the
administrative and judicial branches should show resolve by decisive action
rather than mere lip service.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Chiu went on, problems in the judicial system are mainly the result of
the judiciary's bureaucratic mentality, under which individual judges mind only
their own businesses or even cover up each other's illicit or corrupt
activities.</P>
      <P>Noting that this kind of judicial culture has left conscientious and
incorruptible judges busy and corrupt judges "rich and famous, " Chiu said joint
efforts from within and without the ranks of the judiciary are needed to stop
this cycle of evil.</P>
      <P>In contrast, Lu Hsueh-chang, also a KMT legislator, said he supports Chen's call
for Ma to host a national conference to pool wisdom to map out a judicial reform
package.</P>
      <P>Stressing that judicial reform needs collaboration among the police,
investigators, prosecutors, judges and lawyers, Lu said Ma should play a leading
role in integrating resources in all these sectors to realize the reform goals.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Vincent Siew said Sunday the government will work to create
conditions favorable for the gradual launch of indigenous autonomy on a trial
basis.</P>
      <P>"First of all, the government will review the existing laws and make necessary
legal adaptations or legislate complementary bills to facilitate experimentation
with indigenous autonomy in a gradual manner, " Siew said in a meeting with a
group of aboriginal representatives that included parents and children as well
as tribal leaders.</P>
      <P>The 100-member group, headed by Council of Indigenous Peoples (CIP) Minister Sun
Ta-chuan, visited the Presidential Office to mark Taiwan's Indigenous Peoples
Day.</P>
      <P>Noting that aboriginal people enjoy constitutional protection of their political
rights, Siew said the government is now focusing its efforts on ensuring that
indigenous tribes enjoy educational and economic opportunities on a par with the
country's other ethnic groups.</P>
      <P>"Only through education can aboriginal peoples' talent be fully developed to
enable them to be self-reliant  economically  in preparation for indigenous
autonomy," Siew said.</P>
      <P>Reaffirming  the  government's  commitment  to  implementing indigenous autonomy
in the long run, Siew said the government will carry out relevant policies  in
line with the principles  of accommodating ethnic differences, upholding
fairness and justice, and promoting self-governance.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan boasts ethnic diversity and after years of efforts, we have largely
entered a stage of ethnic harmony. We should treasure this hard-won
achievement," Siew said.</P>
      <P>On his earliest engagements with aboriginal people, Siew recalled that during
World War II, his parents sent him and his siblings to live in a tribal
community in the Alishan mountainous region to escape bombing by the Allied
forces.</P>
      <P>"At the time, I was 5 years old and Taiwan was a target of Allied bombing as it
was then a Japanese colony. I lived in an Alishan aboriginal community for
three-and-a-half years, where I learned to speak some aboriginal language, and I
have fond memories of life back then, " Siew said, adding that the childhood
experiences have consistently pushed him to promote ethnic harmony.</P>
      <P>Siew said the government respects indigenous peoples' identity, cultures, social
systems and customs, while working to help transform their disadvantaged status
in local society due to the flawed policies of yesteryear.</P>
      <P>Acknowledging that aboriginal tribes have rich cultural heritages and artistic
talent, Siew said the government will draw on unique assets such as these to
accelerate the development of local creative and cultural industries.</P>

      <P>In contrast, Lu Hsueh-chang, also a KMT legislator, said he supports Chen's call
for Ma to host a national conference to pool wisdom to map out a judicial reform
package.</P>
      <P>Stressing that judicial reform needs collaboration among the police,
investigators, prosecutors, judges and lawyers, Lu said Ma should play a leading
role in integrating resources in all these sectors to realize the reform goals.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Economic Daily News : Investment incentives and the 'salmon' effect</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>08/02/10  11:29:58
(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Since the signing of a Cross-Taiwan Strait Economic Cooperation Framework
Agreement (ECFA) , the Taiwan government's economic policy has been focused on
attracting investments from abroad and how to open the domestic market to
mainland Chinese investors.</P>
      <P>Plans to offer incentives to China investors were in the works during the
Democratic Progress Party (DPP) administration, but they could not be
implemented  because of political factors.  This contributed to a constant
imbalance in cross-strait investment.</P>
      <P>Taiwan officially opened its doors to mainland Chinese investors in June 2009,
following negotiations on the matter between Taipei and Beijing. Over the past
year, the Ministry of Economic Affairs approved 58 investment applications from
across the strait, with a total value of NT$2.5 billion (US$78 million) ,  which
is an insignificant amount compared to the annual average of US$5 billion
innvested by Taiwanese businessmen in China.</P>
      <P>Mainland Chinese investors are reluctant to come to Taiwan, partly because it
takes time to become familiar with the environment and because only a few
categories of business ventures are open to them.</P>
      <P>In order to attract more Chinese investors, the Taiwan government has to
thoroughly review its policies and narrow the gap between its regulations and
the expectations of investors.</P>
      <P>It is also important to offer more incentives to Taiwanese businessmen abroad
who are planning to return home for various reasons. The government should
consider how best to help them integrate their operations on both sides of the
strait. Another important step is to provide guidelines on the priority
industries in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese businessmen know the local investment climate better than anyone else.
As part of its efforts to attract investments from abroad, the government can
start by providing services to Taiwanese businessmen in the hope that they will
return like salmon to their birthplace. (editorial abstract-Aug.2, 2010). (</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Yani Tseng of Taiwan emerged as the youngest woman golfer to capture three
majors, after she won the British Open at Royal Birkdale Sunday.</P>
      <P>Her previous wins came in the 2008 LPGA Championship and the Kraft Nabisco
Championship in March this year.</P>
      <P>The 21-year-old, who held off Katherine Hull of Australia by just one stroke
Sunday, said afterward in an interview with the CNA that she was very happy to
be able to clinch her third major title in the third year of her professional
golf career.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from local media coverage of her success story:</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>Tseng made history Sunday when she won the Women's British Open title and
260,000 pounds (US$408,000) in prize money. She is the youngest champion in the
event's history and the first Taiwanese golfer to conquer the coastal Royal
Birkdale course since the LPGA Women's British Open was launched in 1976.</P>
      <P>Tseng realized the dream that veteran Taiwanese golfer Lu Liang-huan pursued 39
years ago. In 1971, Lu, now 75 years old, lost to Lee Buck Trevino of the United
States at Royal Birkdale by one stroke.</P>
      <P>Tseng has become the fourth Asian golfer to have her name engraved on the
championship trophy since the British Open was upgraded to a major LPGA event in
2001. The other three Asian winners have all been South Koreans.</P>
      <P>Tseng was also the first female golfer to win both the Kraft Nabisco
Championship and the British Open in the same year.</P>
      <P>"It is great to have won three majors, " a tearful Tseng said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Tseng, who led from round one, went into the final 18 holes with a four-shot
lead.</P>
      <P>"I usually come from behind to win. I've never won from the front before," she
told reporters. "So I was nervous and tired with all the pressure and attention
out there today...It was the toughest win I've had to date." (Aug. 2, 2010).</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>Tseng broke down in tears after she triumphed in the final day showdown with
Australia's Katherine Hull on Sunday to win the British Open.</P>
      <P>She appeared totally in control on the first 54 holes, shooting 68 in every
round and dropping only one shot, but was much more on edge Sunday and the tears
flowed after she made the final putt.</P>
      <P>"I was so tired and the last few holes were so hard, " an emotional Tseng said.
"I felt so much pressure out there and it's been an unbelievable day. Even when
I sunk the putt at the last hole I had to ask my caddie 'did I win?'</P>
      <P>"Katherine played some awesome golf and pushed me all the way. She's a great,
great player."</P>
      <P>In an interview with the CNA, Tseng said her win in the British Open meant a lot
to her.</P>
      <P>"It was at a very special seashore course in the country where the sport
originated... It also marks improvement in my golfing skills," a jubilant Tseng
said. (Aug.2, 2010).</P>
      <P>Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>Tseng said she seemed to have hit a low point after she won the Kraft Nabisco
Championship. A week before the British Open, she went to see her psychologist
to get some advice.</P>
      <P>"She reminded me of some things. She asked me to recall what I think about when
I play well and what I was thinking then. She wanted me to compare the
differences, " Tseng said in a post-game news conference.</P>
      <P>Her instructor also suggested that she sing while playing on the course. "She
advised me to always look happy and look like I was enjoying playing. I sang
even when I was playing badly. Singing helped me to change my way of thinking.
This approach has proved useful."</P>
      <P>As to her favorite songs, Tseng said she likes to sing Taiwanese pop hits.
"Chiang Hui's and S.H.E.'s songs are my favorites. Their hits have often helped
me to play golf in a happy mood and make me less nervous," she said. (Aug. 2,

Taipei City Councilor Chou Wei-yu said at a press conference Monday.</P>
      <P>Chou gave several examples of what he called incomprehensible bus sign
translations,  which  were  done  by the city's  Public Transportation office.</P>
      <P>On the route of the 204 bus, he said, the Hua Zhong Riverside Park stop on Guang
Fu South Road has been translated as "Bin Park Nakagawa China" -- a combination
of English, Chinese and Japanese.</P>
      <P>The 228 Peace Memorial Park stop has become the "Memorial Hall August 228," he
noted.</P>
      <P>At another stop, one would need to have a knowledge of Japanese to figure out
what is "Matsuyama Station, " he said, adding that the proper English
translation is "Song Shan Station."</P>
      <P>In addition to the English translation errors, the design of the bus stop
information signs has long been a problem, Chou said.</P>
      <P>In response, the Public Transportation office promised to prompt the Taipei

      <P>China's Defense Ministry spokesman Geng Yansheng said last Friday that with the
establishment of military security and mutual trust across the Taiwan Strait,
the mainland and Taiwan can discuss anything, even China's withdrawal of
missiles, under the one-China principle.</P>
      <P>The one-China principle is not recognized, in any way, in Taiwan. The
legislators of the ruling and opposition parties all agree on this.</P>
      <P>It was the first time that Beijing made such a suggestion, and its interest in
having that discussion has pricked the curiosity of sensitive observers of China
affairs.</P>
      <P>Why is Beijing so eager to raise this topic?</P>
      <P>It could be because of an internal factor -- the expiry of Hu Jintao's
presidency in 2012 and his desire to leave a legacy of Taiwan's unification with
China. With this in mind, Beijing may be worrying about a possible change of
government in Taiwan and thinking it should inject political issues into cross-
Taiwan Strait relations during Ma Ying-jeou presidency.</P>
      <P>Internationally, China is also feeling pressure as result of recent
developments. With the end of the honeymoon period between U.S. President Barack
Obama and China, the differences between the two sides have become even more
obvious. The reports of China's growing influence have caused worry and fear
among Southeast Asian countries, and they hope the U.S. will remain as a
counterbalancing force in the region.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, China is anxious to make a breakthrough in the island chain
in the West Pacific. Beijing may find it easier to ally with Taiwan than with
Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, the Philippines or India against the U.S. With
Taiwan neutralized, China would stand a better chance of breaking the blockade.</P>
      <P>If it achieves unification with Taiwan, China would reap even bigger strategic
rewards. Forcing Taiwan to accept the one-China principle is a means of getting
Taiwan to take China's side.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Liberty Times: Land seizure unnecessary for science parks</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>08/02/10  15:44:04
(By Nancy Liu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A recent government land acquisition in Dapu, Miaoli has raised public concern
over the industrial park development plan, and the county government's plan to
help the Jhunan Science Park allocate land for domestic industrial usage has
caused serious conflicts between farmers and officials.</P>
      <P>The logic behind the county government land development plan is questionable.
According to a report released by the National Audit Office in 2009, the science
park development plan was flawed and the vacancy rate exceeded 20 percent.
Excessive investment in land acquisition while holding an abundance of space is
dubious.</P>
      <P>County heads and representatives embraced the industrial park development plan
as a way to rescue the feeble and unbalanced infrastructure of Taiwan's economy.
Serious industry migration and transference demanded more investment and
entrepreneurs on the island.</P>
      <P>To resuscitate the economy and create an alluring business incentive, local
farmers were deprived of lands their families held for generations, and their
lifestyles were sacrificed for the benefit of companies and industrial
development. In return, farmers received small subsidies from the local
government.</P>
      <P>Is land acquisition a necessary means of resuscitation? The answer is no.</P>
      <P>According to statistics from 2008, there are 128 districts nation-wide designed
for various industries. Though by the end of 2009 the land development in these
special districts had reached 14,276 hectares, the vacancy rate was rather high
(16.95%).</P>
      <P>The six industrial parks with the lowest occupancy rate are: Yilan Industrial
Park (39.4%) , Kaohsiung Dafa Industrial Park (39.64%), Kaohsiung Software Park
(43.18%), Changhua Industrial Park (57.38%) ,  Yunlin Toyota Industrial Park
(62.84%) and Tainan Technology Park (63.61%). Why these parks are still not
fully used is a question officials should investigate.</P>
      <P>To strike a balance between industrial development and public needs, the
government should come up with a comprehensive plan that seeks to develop the
nearly 2,000 hectares of unused land. The integration will by no means be an
easy task, but it is only through this ordeal that we can satisfy both
traditional industries and technology industries. (Editorial abstract -- Aug. 2,

      <P>Taiwan share prices closed up 1.94 percent Monday in heavy trade to end the
session above the 7,900 point mark as bargain-hunting emerged to boost the
financial sector, riding high liquidity, dealers said.</P>
      <P>The weighted index rose 151.05 points to 7,911.68 after moving between 7,829.19
and 7,917.95, on turnover of NT$141.89 billion (US$4.44 billion).</P>
      <P>The market opened up 0.88 percent and the momentum extended as financial stocks
turned active on market speculation that select small and medium-sized financial
institutions will soon announce acquisition deals amid an industrial
consolidation, dealers said.</P>
      <P>The buying was also boosted by strong performances in other markets in the
region as investors shrugged off last week's reports of slower-than-expected
second quarter growth in the U.S.</P>
      <P>The financial sector saw the highest gains at 3.6 percent. The textile sector
closed up 2.4 percent, the machinery and electronics sector 1.7 percent higher,
the paper and pulp sector was up 1.6 percent and the plastics and chemical
sector rose 1.5 percent.</P>
      <P>Both the cement and construction sectors rose 1.4 percent, while the foodstuff
sector gained 1.2 percent.</P>
      <P>"Valuations of financial shares have been low after recent consolidation.
Investors just seized the opportunity  to take advantage of these cheap stocks,
" Mega Securities analyst Alex Huang said.</P>
      <P>"Many investors remained cautious about the global economic climate for the
second half of this year. I prefer to say today's gains were technical in
nature," Huang said.</P>
      <P>Mars Hsu, an analyst with Grand Cathay Securities, said the market, technically
speaking, was driven by high liquidity.</P>
      <P>"As the central bank is closely watching transactions in the property market to
prevent the real estate business from bursting its bubble, many investors have
been moving their funds to the stock market," Hsu said.</P>
      <P>"I expect liquidity-driven buying will continue to dominate the market as long
as the money stays in Taiwan, " Hsu said. "But the interest is likely to shift
to non-electronic stocks from the bellwether high-tech sector."</P>
      <P>Hsu said recent comments from some high-tech heavyweights on the industrial
outlook have disappointed many investors.</P>
      <P>Mega Securities' Huang said investors have to remain cautious about a possible
major pullback in the index as technical resistance around the 7,900 point level
could be heavy.</P>
      <P>Among financial stocks, King's Town Bank gained 6.69 percent to NT$14.35, Cosmos
Bank rose 6.90 percent to NT$7.59 and Ta Chong Bank added 6.87 percent to
NT$8.24.</P>
      <P>In the high-tech sector, smartphone maker HTC rose 3.57 percent to NT$609.00 and
United Microelectronics Corp. gained 2.11 percent to NT$14.50, while Taiwan
Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. fell 0.16 percent to NT$62.30.</P>

      <P>Thirteen cases involving lost belongings in checked luggage were reported by
Taiwanese travelers taking flights from the United States to Taiwan in the first
seven months of this year, aviation police said Monday.</P>
      <P>Liu Ke-chang, the head of the Aviation Police Office's Crime Investigation
Brigade, said the reportedly lost items were worth about NT$350,000, including
26 brand-name handbags, such as Louis Vuitton and Coach, three notebook
computers, mobile phones, three watches, two necklaces and NT$4,800 in cash.</P>
      <P>The aviation police usually receive "one or two, and sometimes no reports" of
lost items a year.</P>
      <P>After investigating, the aviation office judged the items were most likely
stolen outside Taiwan's territory.</P>
      <P>Most of the checked bags belonged to travelers taking direct flights from Los
Angeles to Taiwan, or from other U.S. cities to Taiwan via Los Angeles.</P>
      <P>Since the terrorist strikes of Sept. 11, 2001, the U.S. has adopted strict
security measures, including bans on passengers locking checked baggage, Liu
said, adding that this might contribute to an increase in theft by luggage
handlers.</P>
      <P>Aviation Police Office Chief Diao Chien-sheng called on the public not to put
items of value in their checked baggage, including digital cameras, notebook
computers, jewelry and cash.</P>

      <P>An employee who smokes four cigarettes per day during work hours costs his or
her employers at least NT$60,000 (US$1,886) a year, according to Department of
Health (DOH) estimates.</P>
      <P>In an anti-smoking campaign, officials from the DOH Bureau of Health Promotion
said employers should encourage their workers to stop smoking as it cuts into
work time by about one hour per day, assuming a consumption rate of four
cigarettes per person during work hours.</P>
      <P>The bureau's statistics show that one in six employees -- 18 percent -- are
smokers, while 14 percent are exposed to secondhand smoke in the workplace, the
officials said.</P>
      <P>Exposure to secondhand smoke, also called involuntary smoking or passive
smoking,  can cause lung cancer and breast cancer in nonsmoking adults and
leukemia, lymphoma, and brain tumors in children, studies have found.</P>
      <P>As part of its efforts to help workers to steer clear of the risks of smoking,
the Bureau of Health Promotion invited some people who have kicked the habit to
share their experiences at a news conference Monday.</P>
      <P>Wang Yun-cheng, an executive from Taiwan Mobile, said he was addicted to
cigarettes  for more than 10 years and his many unsuccessful attempts to quit
prompted his son to call him a liar.</P>
      <P>Finally, Wang said, he joined a "quit-smoking" group program organized by his
company and succeeded in kicking the habit, with encouragement  from his co-
workers and professional  help from counselors.</P>
      <P>He advised smokers who want to quit not to carry cigarettes or lighters and
avoid places where people smoke.</P>
      <P>Ma Chin-pao, 36, from the cellphone manufacturer HTC, said he quit smoking after
18 years by enrolling in a program sponsored by HTC.</P>
      <P>"It was the beginning of a virtuous circle, because my father who had been
smoking for six decades, followed my lead and quit as well, "he said.</P>
      <P>According to the bureau's estimates, employers will benefit from helping  their
workers  to stop  smoking,  as the  cost  of tobacco-cessation programs is much
lower than the losses incurred as a result of people smoking during work hours.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council of Agriculture (COA) on Monday promised that within two days it will
rescue and rehome endangered animals such as Bengal tigers and Malayan sun bears
that are reportedly in captivity on a private recreational farm in Tainan
County.</P>
      <P>Activists said that the animals -- including monkeys, Formosan black bears, and
rare birds -- are kept in inhumane conditions and that many of them suffer from
serious physical and psychological trauma.</P>
      <P>At a press conference on Monday, the COA promised to dispatch a team to rescue
the animals and move them to the Taipei City Zoo, said Lin Kuo-chang, section
chief of the Wildlife Conservation Section of the Forestry Bureau.</P>
      <P>Lin said that the Wildlife Conservation Law was passed in June 1989 and many
privately owned wildlife animals came into the owners' possession prior to the
law.</P>
      <P>According to the law, all imports and exports of wild animals, including live
tigers and tiger-related products, are outlawed except for the purpose of
scientific research or exhibition such as in zoos.</P>
      <P>Violators face a fine of up to NT$1.5 million and five years in prison.</P>
      <P>Lin said the government will usually first ask the owners to provide an adequate
habitat for the animals. If the owners fail to do so, the government will step
in, confiscate and rehome the animals in one of the eight government-run
sanctuaries around the country.</P>
      <P>Lin said the government spends NT$50 million each year taking care of more than
4,000 animals kept in the sanctuaries.</P>
      <P>The farm located in Tainan County is operated by Huang Kuo-nan, a member of the
COA's wildlife conservation panel from 1995 to 2000 nicknamed the "Snake King"
for his possession of an array of endangered species on his farm, which is open
to the public.</P>
      <P>Huang has denied any mistreatment of animals and categorically rejected
accusations that he is involved in the illegal trade of tigers and bears, saying
he has been "framed" by journalists.</P>
      <P>At the press conference, the Environment and Animal Society of Taiwan (EAST)
showed a video clip as evidence that Huang tried to sell endangered animals to
an activist who posed as a buyer two years ago.</P>
      <P>According to EAST, Huang told the undercover activist that the market price for
a Malayan sun bear was NT$150,000, NT$250,000 for a Formosan black bear,
NT$500,000 for a live tiger and that a dead tiger was worth over NT$1 million.</P>
      <P>Huang reportedly also said he could help the buyer to dodge the law by providing
a document that the animals were exchanged as gifts.</P>
      <P>"According to our investigations, the animals on Huang's farm are living in
horrid conditions and crowded spaces. The Malayan sun bear has been so
traumatized that all he does is pace back and forth. A Formosan rock monkey
displays self-injurious behavior such as chewing at its own genitals and
fingers, " said Chen Yu-min, a supervisor at EAST.</P>
      <P>Chen urged the government to take speedy action to rescue the animals and bring
the violators to justice.</P>
      <P>"We are also asking the public to boycott any venues that abuse animals," Chen
said.</P>
      <P>She added that Huang is not an isolated case. Local media have reported a villa
in Chiayi County currently houses a Formosan black bear and a Malayan sun bear.</P>

      <P>The launch of a new financial aid program for employment creation has been
postponed from October this year to Jan. 1, 2011 as the government needs more
time to fine tune the implementation, a Cabinet official said Monday.</P>
      <P>Lai Sun-quae, director of the Small and Medium Enterprise Administration (SMEA),
said Premier Wu Den-yi gave the SMEA a directive to take an extra three months
to make the program more substantive.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet has also requested that the agency give more publicity and
visibility to the program during the three-month period, Lai said.</P>
      <P>The SMEA plans to allocate NT$900 million (US$28.14 million) in subsidies to
small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) for the employment of new workers.</P>
      <P>Lai said the delay also reflected the Cabinet's fears that the public would view
the subsidy program as an attempt by Premier Wu to cut unemployment to less than
5 percent by the end of this year in keeping with his promise.</P>
      <P>Critics have said in the media that the Cabinet intends to use the new job
creation program plan to burnish Wu's record.</P>
      <P>However, Vice Minister of Economic Affairs Lin Sheng-chung told reporters the
program has nothing to do with Premier Wu's target regarding the unemployment
rate, but rather is aimed at improving the job market.</P>
      <P>Earlier this year, Wu promised to step down if the administration failed to
lower the jobless rate to less than 5 percent by the end of the year.</P>
      <P>However, Lin said, even if the subsidy program was implemented in early October,
the funds would not be handed out until January and the effects on the job
market would not become obvious until next year.</P>
      <P>The jobless rate in Taiwan was a record 6.13 percent in August 2009, as the
economy took a hard hit during the global financial crisis, but the rate has
been gradually improving since the economy began to recover.</P>
      <P>Under the NT$900 million employment creation program, qualifying SMEs will be
given NT$10,000 a month for six months for each newly hired employee who is
under 45 years old and has been out of work for three months.</P>
      <P>For new workers 45 years old and over, the NT$10,000 subsidy will be maintained
for 12 months.</P>
      <P>The number of new employees allowed under the program should not exceed 30
percent of the company's total workforce, according to the plan.</P>
      <P>SMEs are required to submit a proposal to the SMEA to show that the new
employment will enhance their innovative efforts.</P>
      <P>In the manufacturing sector, a company with paid-in capital of less than NT$80
million is categorized as an SME, while in the non-manufacturing sector SMEs are
classified as those that generate NT$100 million or less in annual sales.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Magazine digest -- Taiwan's disappearing indigenous languages</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>08/02/10  19:16:41
(Dissent 6)(translated by Kay Liu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The languages of Taiwan's indigenous inhabitants date back more than 6,000 years
and originate from the family of Austronesian languages that still span islands
across Southeast Asia and the South Pacific.</P>
      <P>But with government policy in the past emphasizing the use of Mandarin, these
tribal languages and dialects gradually lost their place in people's daily
lives, and they have now become one of Taiwan's endangered cultural treasures.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's government officially recognizes 14 aboriginal tribes, which comprise 2
percent of the population. Each tribe has its own tribal language, and the 14
tribes speak a total of 42 dialects.</P>
      <P>In addition, Taiwan has about 10 plains, or "ping pu," aboriginal tribes, which
have their own tribal languages and dialects. These tribal people have been more
assimilated into Chinese Han culture than indigenous peoples living in
mountainous areas.</P>
      <P>The government has funded courses over the past 10 years to help all indigenous
peoples regain familiarity with their mother tongues, but even today,
individuals under 35 years of age still cannot speak with tribal elders using
only indigenous languages.</P>
      <P>Preserving the languages of pingpu tribes is an even bigger challenge because
only a few elders remain who can speak the languages fluently.</P>
      <P>Another obstacle holding back the promotion of the languages of officially
recognized tribes is their sheer number.</P>
      <P>Reverend Sakinu Tepiq of the Paiwan tribe in eastern Taiwan's Taitung County
said the most important task is to reestablish an environment in which the
languages are used so they become relevant to children.</P>
      <P>He also believes churches can play an important role in the process. The
earliest written versions of indigenous languages were romanizations of pingpu
dialects by Dutch missionaries in the 17th century, and that tradition continues
to this day.</P>
      <P>Most churches have services in indigenous languages. A church in central
Taiwan's Changhua County, for instance, offers services in both the Mandarin and
Amis languages four days a week and encourages participants to use their mother
tongue at gatherings afterwards.</P>
      <P>Sun Ta-chuan, the head of the Council of Indigenous Peoples, said the council
started a six-year program in 2008 to build a collection of spoken and written
examples of indigenous languages, promote the learning of the languages and
produce experts in the languages.</P>
      <P>Sun said language is a living thing and for languages that are seldom used, the
focus should be on how to collect and record them and compile them in a database
so that they are not lost forever.</P>

market no matter whether consumers need entry-level models or high-end products,
" said Jose Liao, a senior product manager at AsusTek.</P>
      <P>Liao said models from the recently unveiled U-series would draw attention
because of their ultra-thin design.</P>
      <P>"In addition, sales of the company's netbook computers remain very stable, "
Liao said. "The netbooks are also serving as a driving force to boost the total
shipments."</P>
      <P>Liao said netbook computers  account for 35-40 percent of AsusTek's total
notebook computer sales.</P>
      <P>In the first half of this year, AsusTek's notebook computer shipments rose 40
percent from 2009, when a global financial meltdown dragged down the comparison
base.</P>
      <P>With regard to the upcoming Taipei Computer Applications Show, which will run
between Aug. 5 and Aug. 9, AsusTek said its notebook computer sales volume in
the exhibition is expected to grow 30 percent from a year earlier, while PC
shipments are expected to rise 50 percent during the show.</P>
      <P>The company said that in the exhibition it will emphasize the light weight of
its notebook computers, three-dimensional technology, long-lasting batteries and
competitive pricing.</P>

      <P>More than 200 fishing boats gathered in the waters off Hsinchu County, northern
Taiwan Monday to protest against live-fire training exercises the Republic of
China Army holds in the nearby sea, a practice the fishermen said seriously
affects their livelihoods.</P>
      <P>The protesters,  mobilized by the Hsinchu Area Fishermen's Association, said
that the Army regularly holds exercises involving surface-to-sea firing at a
shooting range in Kengzihkou, and demanded compensation for losses due to the
exercises.</P>
      <P>The association demanded that the range be relocated, fishing grounds returned
to fishermen, and compensation of about NT$1.4 billion for losses it said were
incurred because of the exercises.</P>
      <P>According  to  Wu Chun-an,  president  of the  fishermen's association, the Army
holds firing sessions an average of 195 days a year, causing losses to about 450
fishing boats that are unable to fish during the sessions.</P>
      <P>Chu Chien-cheng, the head of the Army's Armor Training Command, said that the
Army is more than willing to talk with local fishermen and that it has held
eight meetings with the Hsinchu County government, the Fisheries Agency, the
fishermen's association and other local fishermen's representatives.</P>
      <P>On the NT$1.4 billion in compensation  that the fishermen requested, Chu said
the matter would be handled in accordance with law.</P>
      <P>He added that the Army has sought funds from the Ministry of National Defense to
give NT$10 million in subsidies each to the Sinfong Township Office and Jhubei
City Office between 2010 and 2011. He also said the Army has helped the township
and the city gain government funds totaling NT$3.4 million for improving fishing
facilities near the shooting range and for marine conservation.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's Chan Yung-jan and China's Zheng Jie lost a hotly contested doubles
finals at the WTA's Bank of West Classic Sunday in Stanford, California, but
their strong showing at the event hinted at their potential in this year's U.S.
Open.</P>
      <P>The second seeds were outlasted by the wild card pairing of Americans Lindsay
Davenport and Liezel Huber in the final 7-5, 6-7 (8) , 10-8, leaving them having
to settle for the runner-up prize money of US$17,800.</P>
      <P>Chan and Zheng jumped out to a 4-2 lead in the first set after breaking their
opponents' serve twice, but Davenport reversed the momentum with accurate
volleys to help the Americans win five of the set's last six games.</P>
      <P>The second set, in which Chan and Zheng offset their bigger adversaries'
advantage at net with well-placed lobs, went to a tiebreaker, in which the
Taiwanese/Chinese duo prevailed 10-8.</P>
      <P>In the third set super-tiebreaker (with the first team to 10 points winning the
set) , Chan and Zheng fell behind 4-0 before rallying to even the score at 5-5
and 8-8.</P>
      <P>But Davenport, a former world No. 1 in both singles and doubles, won her serve
on match point to clinch victory and the US$34,000 first prize.</P>
      <P>It was the second consecutive year Chan made it to the Bank of West doubles
finals. She and Monica Niculescu of Romania were defeated for the title last
year by the Williams sisters.</P>
      <P>From the time she and Chuang Chia-jung ended their vaunted partnership in
September 2008, Chan played with 14 different new partners in an elusive search
for doubles success before joining together with Zheng, one of China's top
female doubles players, in February 2010.</P>
      <P>They reached the round of 16 at the French Open and lost in the first round at
Wimbledon, but they hope their performance in Stanford bodes well for their
prospects at the final major of the year, the U.S. Open, which begins later this

    <HEADLINE>Owning wild animals should be banned in Taiwan: foreign activist</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's government needs to make it illegal to keep wild animals in captivity
for private purposes, a foreign animal activist urged on Monday after local
animal conservationists exposed several places where wild animals were being
held in poor conditions.</P>
      <P>According to the Environment and Animal Society of Taiwan (EAST), a recreational
farm operator in Tainan County and an individual in Chiayi County are keeping
several wild animals -- Malayan sun bears, Formosan black bears, Formosan rock
monkeys, tigers, and rare birds, in private captivity.</P>
      <P>The animals, said EAST, are kept in extremely inhumane conditions and suffer
from severe physical and psychological trauma.</P>
      <P>EAST said they have pictures of a 20-year-old Malay sun bear in Jhuci Township
caged in a 3.3-meter-wide 1.5-meter-tall steel bar cage.</P>
      <P>"The bear is unable to walk about and is forced to stand on its feet almost the
entire day. The paws are also infected. The eyes are covered with a thin white
film," the group said.</P>
      <P>EAST has appealed to several international organizations such as the World
Society for the Protection of Animals (WSPA) on behalf of the animals.</P>
      <P>In a letter responding to the pictures of the bears in captivity provided by
EAST, Victor Watkins, the wildlife adviser of WSPA in the United Kingdom, said
the bears are being kept in "totally inadequate conditions."</P>
      <P>"These are adult bears that need a natural habitat to live in. Even if they are
captive animals they should be kept in a large enclosure with earth, trees, and
large water pools with plenty of areas to hide away from the heat of the day and
the cold weather of winter," Watkins said.</P>
      <P>The close-up pictures of one of the Malayan sun bear's paws indicate that the
paws are infected and dry, and the split claws could cause further infection, he
said.</P>
      <P>"This happened because the bear does not have any natural substrate to walk on.
The bears have to stand on metal bars and also on the concrete cage floor --
which when wet can cause the paws to become raw and infected," he wrote.</P>
      <P>The bear specialist urged Taiwan's government to outlaw private ownership of
wild animals and stressed the importance of having strict welfare guidelines and
regular veterinarian care even for animals in zoos.</P>
      <P>The International Union for Conservation of Nature in 2007 listed sun bears as
"vulnerable, " which means the species is likely to become endangered unless the
circumstances threatening its survival and reproduction improve.</P>
      <P>Bear paws, along with other wild animal body parts, such as tiger penises and
tiger bones, have long been used in Chinese medicine as an elixir or a
supplement. In Taiwan, however, any use of wild animals for medicinal purposes
is illegal.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Premier rebuts accusation of forced relocation of aborigines</HEADLINE>

      <P>Facing public outcry over reports of government measures that would force
aboriginal tribes to move from their homes, Premier Wu Den-yih said Monday that
there was no such policy.</P>
      <P>"The government respects the choices of the victims" of massive flooding
triggered by Typhoon Morakot last August, Wu said.</P>
      <P>Wu's comments followed a China Times report on Monday that said the Indigenous
Peoples Action Coalition of Taiwan (IPACT) accused the government of "cutting
off aboriginals' links with the land."</P>
      <P>The government's post-Morakot reconstruction projects involve relocating people
from locations destroyed by flooding if scholars, experts and tribal leaders
define the places as "dangerous areas."</P>
      <P>Wu mentioned new homes that were built for victims from Kaohsiung County's
Jiasian Township and Pingtung County's Changjhih Township, saying the residents
"had a free choice and moved of their own volition."</P>
      <P>There are also settlement programs for people living in the areas that were
classified by experts and scholars as vulnerable to natural disasters but not
thought so by the locals, Wu added.</P>
      <P>He said that people residing in "dangerous areas" are allowed to stay if they
wish, but are obliged to relocate to a safer place whenever there is the threat
of a typhoon, landslide or flooding.</P>
      <P>Wu added that "if they choose to move to a safer place at any time in the next
three years, the government will help them relocate."</P>
      <P>The China Times report cited the IPACT as saying that in the past year, the
government had initiated and implemented the relocation policy too hastily
because it was eager for quick success and instant benefits.</P>
      <P>The civic group said it "hurt the heart" that the government "never tried to
think from the viewpoint of the indigenous people when outlining the
reconstruction policy."</P>
      <P>Saying the only goal of the reconstruction policy was forcing the aboriginals to
move away from their villages on mountains, the IPACT blasted the relocation
measures as "rude and crude" while pointing out that not all the flood-affected
areas should be classified as "dangerous areas."</P>
      <P>The organization plans a protest rally on Ketagalan Boulevard in front the
Presidential Office on Aug. 6-7, the report said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MND denies report on China weapons removal 'wish list'</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of National Defense (MND) dismissed a media report Monday that said
the military has begun planning a confidence-building mechanism with China and
would issue a "wish list" asking China to dismantle weapons targeting Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The ministry was referring to an article carried in the Monday edition of the
Taipei-based China Times daily that said Taiwan's national security and military
authorities had in late June secretly started preparatory work for forging a
confidence-building mechanism with China.</P>
      <P>Citing "authoritative government sources, " the paper said the military would
not only ask China to dismantle its missiles targeting Taiwan but also ask China
to remove command, control, communications and intelligence systems, warships
and military aircraft targeting Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In future negotiations, the paper said, the military will come up with a wish
list detailing weaponry that Taiwan would demand China dismantle or relocate.</P>
      <P>The MND, however, said in a press statement that the report was not true.</P>
      <P>The ministry  said  that crafting  a cross-Taiwan  Strait confidence-building
mechanism is a national issue involving national security, and that the military
will strictly follow government policy guidelines that prioritize economic
topics over political issues, urgent trouble over less hasty issues, and easy
problems over difficult topics.</P>
      <P>The military will coordinate with the government in promoting cross-strait
exchanges, the statement added.</P>
      <P>Lawmakers were divided over the newspaper report. Shuai Hua-ming, a ruling
Kuomintang (KMT) lawmaker who used to be a senior army officer, questioned the
credibility of the report.</P>
      <P>"I do not think that the military would prepare such a wish list because Taiwan
has no clout to force China to accept such demands, " Shuai said.</P>
      <P>As to when Taiwan and China would start political talks after signing a landmark
economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) last month, Shuai said he
believes such talks would not begin any time soon.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan would be willing to address cross-strait political issues only after the
ECFA generates substantial economic benefits, " Shuai said.</P>
      <P>Another KMT lawmaker, Lin Yu-fang, said the "wish list" overture was an MND
response to China's recent proposal that issues concerning the removal of
missiles targeting Taiwan can be discussed under the "one China" precondition.</P>
      <P>"The MND has conventionally been cool toward China's missile removal overture
because such proposals are empty talk given the fact that missiles are highly
mobile and could simply be redeployed very quickly at any time," Lin said.</P>
      <P>By floating a "wish list" proposal, Lin said, the MND was tossing a hot potato
back to China.</P>
      <P>Legislator  Ker  Chien-ming  of the  opposition  Democratic Progressive Party
said Taiwan does not need to respond to China's missile withdrawal overture
because Taiwan should never come into cross-strait talks under Beijing's "one
China" principle.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's top negotiator with China reiterated at a seminar on Monday the
country's desire to take part in the economic integration of the region, but a
Chinese official taking part in the forum did not respond to the plea.</P>
      <P>Chiang Pin-kung, chairman of the Straits Exchange Foundation, which is in charge
of Taiwan's dealings with China, said the economic cooperation framework
agreement (ECFA) recently signed with China provides it an opportunity to
compete with Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) members in China on
an equal footing.</P>
      <P>Chiang said, however, that more needs to be done because the region is
integrating economically, with China, South Korea, Japan, India, Australia and
New Zealand, trying to form a regional trade bloc with ASEAN.</P>
      <P>"Rather than being excluded from the process, Taiwan would like to take part in
it and beat Japan and South Korea to the punch, " Chiang said.</P>
      <P>An active role for Taiwan in the region would preserve the dynamism of its
economy and strengthen its confidence in cooperating more closely on trade with
China, to the benefit of both sides, Chiang said.</P>
      <P>He contended that such cooperation will lay a solid foundation for the peaceful
development between Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>Zhang Mingqing, the vice president of China's Association for Relations Across
the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) and the head of China's delegation to the seminar,
did not respond to Chiang's appeal.</P>
      <P>Instead, he lauded the conclusion of the ECFA in his speech, calling it a
milestone in ties between Beijing and Taipei that will set a new stage for
bilateral relations.</P>
      <P>The trade pact, clinched on June 29, is a preliminary form of free trade pact
and an attempt by the two sides to institutionalize their trade relations.</P>
      <P>Taiwan hopes the pact will help it negotiate similar trade pacts with other
states, but Beijing has been reluctant to see it sign pacts with other states
fearing they would give international legitimacy to Taiwan's push to be
recognized as a sovereign state.</P>
      <P>The annual seminar on China's modernization, which opened here on Monday, was
jointly staged by ARATS and the private Academic Foundation for Advancing
Chinese Modernization in Taipei.</P>
      <P>More than 40 scholars from Taiwan and China are attending this year's seminar.</P>

      <P>A Taichung man, who was confirmed as having an acute infection of the intestine
called shigellosis that he picked up in Indonesia, has been treated and cured,
the Taichung City Bureau of Health said Monday.</P>
      <P>Bureau officials said the man was part of a 16-member tour group that visited
Bali July 7-11, After the group's return, four of its members developed fevers,
stomach aches and diarrhea, and three were later diagnosed with shigellosis.</P>
      <P>Inadequately cooked food at a barbecue on July 10 was suspected to be the cause
of infection.</P>
      <P>After confirming that the Taichung resident was suffering from the intestinal
ailment, health officials tested people who had come in contact with the man and
disinfected his house.</P>
      <P>Shigellosis has an incubation period of 12 to 96 hours, but it can sometimes
last up to one week. Possible symptoms include diarrhea, fever, nausea,
vomiting, cramps, and blood in one's stool.</P>
      <P>The Centers for Disease Control again reminded travelers to Southeast Asia and
other tropical areas to pay particular attention to personal hygiene.</P>

      <P>Several scholars from China voiced support Monday for an idea broached by
President Ma Ying-jeou last year that it would be better for Chinese speakers
to know traditional characters in general but to write them in simplified form.</P>
      <P>Scholars in Taiwan and China have long argued over the merits of the two writing
systems. Traditional characters are prevalent in Taiwan and Hong Kong, while
simplified characters are used in China and Singapore.</P>
      <P>At a seminar at Shih Chien University  in Taipei on the modernization of China,
Zheng Liang, director of the Chinese Language and Literature  program at Xiamen
University,  said simplified characters have historical roots, as about 70
percent of them appeared in ancient Chinese books.</P>
      <P>He also argued that traditional characters have not remained intact, changing
periodically to simpler forms.</P>
      <P>Zheng Lianghe, deputy director of the Chinese Language and Literatures
Department at North China University of Technology, said many Chinese schools
have actually asked students to gain familiarity with traditional characters
even though only simplified characters are officially taught and written.</P>
      <P>In fact, he said, traditional and simplified characters co-exist in today's
China since most Chinese academic institutions involved in researching history
and ancient books are adopting traditional characters.</P>
      <P>"The Chinese academic world is generally in support of Ma's call for
'recognizing traditional and writing simplified characters, '" he said,
referring to a comment Ma made in June 2009 during a meeting with American-
Chinese representatives.</P>
      <P>Honorary professor Fu Hsi-jen of Taiwan's Tamkang University, said Chinese
characters have undergone "reforms" since ancient times, with simplification
more frequently adopted than "complication."</P>
      <P>In China, he said, government authorities have dominated national cultural
policies, in contrast to Taiwan where scholars generally playing the leading
role in cultural development.</P>
      <P>China therefore sees characters as a "tool, " emphasizing the principle of
convenient usage, Fu argued, while Taiwan insists on the "cultural significance"
of characters.</P>
      <P>The scholar acknowledged it will be impossible for either Taiwan or China to
convince the other to change its stand on Chinese characters.</P>
      <P>But he suggested traditional characters be taught first followed by their
simplified version, because it will be easier for students to recognize
simplified words after learning traditional characters than vice versa.</P>
      <P>Fu also called on Taiwanese schools to teach students to recognize simplified
characters and allow people to write freely using both forms of characters.</P>

      <P>The first Taiwanese golfer ever to win the Women's British Open said Sunday she
will return home in the near future to share her joy in capturing the coveted
title, which she described as the toughest triumph of her career.</P>
      <P>"The victory means a lot to me. It was at a very special coastal course in the
country where the sport originated. It also reflects an improvement in my game,
" Yani Tseng said in an interview with the Central News Agency after winning the
2010 Ricoh British Open at the Royal Birkdale Golf Club.</P>
      <P>"I talked to my parents by phone after my win and I'll return to Taiwan in one
or two months to share my joy with my family, my friends and fans and all those
who have helped me in my career, " a jubilant Tseng said.</P>
      <P>It was the 21-year-old's second major of the year and the third of her career.</P>
      <P>"I'm very happy to be able to clinch my third major in the third year of my
professional golf career, " said Tseng, who became the youngest player in
history to have captured three major titles.</P>
      <P>Her previous wins came in the 2008 LPGA Championship and the Kraft Nabisco
Championship in March this year.</P>
      <P>Tseng said her next goal is to win the U.S. Open Championship to complete the
career grand slam.</P>
      <P>"It is one of the tournaments I want to win the most. It won't be easy, but it
has long been a goal of mine. I hope I can become the world's top golfer and
ultimately make it into the Hall of Fame, " a confident Tseng said.</P>
      <P>"What I need to do now is to practice hard and move toward my goal step by
step."</P>
      <P>As for the British Open triumph, Tseng said the championship "means all of my
sweat and effort has paid off."</P>
      <P>She needed every bit of that effort and a bit of luck to prevail on Sunday.</P>
      <P>Tseng had played brilliantly over the first 54 holes, carding only one bogey in
shooting three consecutive 68s. She held four-shot leads after both the second
and third rounds and appeared to be on her way to a comfortable victory.</P>
      <P>But Tseng clearly suffered from nerves on Sunday, bogeying three of the first 10
holes, including missing a short putt for par on the 10th hole that left her
only two up on Katherine Hull of Australia, and when Hull birdied 13, the margin
was cut to one.</P>
      <P>With Tseng putting tentatively throughout the back nine, Hull had her chances to
pull even, but a birdie putt to tie at 17 lipped out, and her second shot on the
par-5 18th found a greenside bunker as Tseng was trying to recover from teeing
off into a fairway bunker.</P>
      <P>Even with Hull's run of bad luck, Tseng needed to sink a five-foot par putt on
18 to win, which she did, and she then broke into tears in her caddie's arms.</P>
      <P>"It was the toughest win I've had to date, " she recalled. "I usually come from
behind to win. I have never won from the front before. So I was nervous and
tired with the pressure and attention out there on the last day."</P>
      <P>She admitted that the pressure nearly got to her.</P>
      <P>"I was so tired and the last few holes were so hard, " an emotional Tseng said.
"I felt so much pressure out there and it's been an unbelievable day."</P>
      <P>But the challenge has enabled her to learn to be patient and composed.</P>
      <P>"I have learned to control my body language, to make myself look calm and look
like I'm enjoying playing, " Tseng said. She revealed that she even occasionally
sang Taiwanese pop hits to calm herself during Sunday's round.</P>

      <P>A drug developed by the National Health Research Institutes in Jhunan, Miaoli
County, has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for tests on
humans.</P>
      <P>Hsieh Hsing-pang, a researcher at the institutes' Division of Biotechnology and
Pharmaceutical Research told a news conference in Taipei Monday that the green
light came from Washington on July 30.</P>
      <P>The experiment is expected to be conducted at National Cheng Kung University
Hospital in Tainan City, he said.</P>
      <P>"When the experiment is completed within two years as scheduled, it will set a
precedent for a new drug being developed and produced, from beginning to end, in
Taiwan," Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>The small molecular drug, labeled DBPR104, was discovered by the body in 2001.</P>
      <P>The chemical was found to be able to inhibit the growth of abnormal blood
vessels in tumors and thereby cut off nutrients to the tumors and destroy them
gradually.</P>
      <P>In experiments on mice, the drug cut down the size of tumors to one-sixth of
their original size.</P>
      <P>This drug was transferred to a local pharmaceutical company for production in
2008 after it was patented by U.S. authorities in 2005.</P>
      <P>"The U.S. Food and Drug Administration's approval is recognition of the National

    <HEADLINE>Remove missiles based on '92 consensus': presidential spokesman</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Presidential Office said Monday that Taiwan's people will not accept
Beijing's call to remove its missiles targeted at Taiwan only after Taiwan
accepts the "one China" principle.</P>
      <P>"It would be a crucial step toward advancing cross-strait relations if China
would take the initiative to remove its missile based on the '1992 consensus'
reached between the two sides, " Presidential spokesman Lo Chih-chiang said.</P>
      <P>He was responding to a statement made three days earlier by a Chinese military
spokesman calling for Taiwan to accept the "one China" principle before the
missiles could be moved.</P>
      <P>The "1992 consensus" refers to a tacit agreement reached between negotiators of
Taiwan and China in 1992 that "there is only one China but Taipei and Beijing
are allowed to have their respective definitions of one China."</P>
      <P>Beijing has always said that Taiwan and China have agreed to the "one China"
principle  while Taipei  has insisted  on freely interpreting the concept.</P>
      <P>The "consensus," which critics contend never existed, has served as the
foundation for Taiwan and China to reopen talks after President Ma Ying-jeou was
sworn in on May 2008.</P>
      <P>Lo said that peaceful and positive cross-strait engagement not only serves to
meet the expectations of the people on both sides but is also well accepted by
the international community.</P>
      <P>Lo called attention to the "inharmonious picture" in which over 1,000 missiles
are still deployed against Taiwan "amid this warming atmosphere, " and he urged
China to have the missiles removed or dismantled for the good of the cross-
strait ties.</P>
      <P>He reiterated President Ma Ying-jeou's  call for improving relations based on
the principles of "facing reality, building mutual trust, shelving differences
and creating a win-win situation."</P>

      <P>Taiwan's film industry launched a new trailer Sunday to thank movie fans for
choosing to watch movies at movie theaters or genuine DVDs at home and help the
sector survive.</P>
      <P>In the trailer, Taiwanese film director Doze Niu, who made the hit film Monga,
appealed to people to do the right thing.</P>
      <P>"Please support legitimate movies, not only for the sake of protecting the jobs
of those who work in the movie industry, but also for the purpose of being able
to enjoy many more touching movies," he said.</P>
      <P>The trailer also featured messages from others who work in the Taiwanese film
industry, including veteran cinema projector operator A-Kun, who said: "If you
continue to support genuine movies, I can carry on with my professional career."</P>
      <P>Mike Ellis, the president and managing director of the Motion Picture
Association, Asia Pacific, lauded the trailer as a worthwhile initiative that
shows the genuine appreciation of Taiwan's film industry of movie fans who make
a choice to watch content that has not been counterfeited.</P>
      <P>"By making that choice they are voting for a healthy film industry, and that is
beneficial to everyone," Ellis said.</P>
      <P>The video trailer will appear in all movie theaters on six television stations
in Taiwan. It can also be found on the Taiwan Foundation   Against   Copyright

    <TEXT>
      <P>Having made little progress in defusing the anger of Mailiao Township residents,
Premier Wu Den-yih said Monday that their concerns triggered by fires at a
nearby petrochemical complex could be resolved using methods to settle public
hazard disputes.</P>
      <P>A public hazard dispute settlement commission should be formed if the private
Formosa Petrochemical Corp. fails to reach an agreement with local residents on
pollution and damage caused by fires at the company's petrochemical complex in
the Yunlin County township last month, Wu said.</P>
      <P>County chief "Su Chih-fen should head the commission based on the law, " Wu
added, while talking about the latest accident at the complex, which was the
second of its kind in July.</P>
      <P>The fire, which broke out on July 25, reportedly caused serious air pollution
that people living in the the nearby area claimed has jeopardized their health
and caused great damage to coastal fish ponds in downwind areas.</P>
      <P>Wu reiterated that all relevant governmental agencies, including the county's
environmental protection bureau, quickly took measures to handle the accident.</P>
      <P>He said he himself ordered the oil refinery that was hit by the fire to cease
operations at once, referring to his meeting with Su and Formosa Petrochemical
executives July 30. He also requested the company to compensate local residents
for their losses and pay for health checkups.</P>
      <P>The measures, however, failed to ease the anger of Mailiao residents, who
blasted the oil refinery and petrochemical complex for having caused harm to
public safety.</P>
      <P>The complex is home to over 60 factories and facilities including three oil
refineries, three naphtha crackers, a co-generation plant, a thermal power plant
and the Mailiao Industrial Harbor.</P>
      <P>Members of a township self-help organization staged a protest outside the front
gate of the complex Sunday evening, calling for the complex to stop operations
entirely for safety checks.</P>
      <P>The activists also asked for the company to pay for local residents' health care
that is not covered by the National Health Insurance system.</P>

    <HEADLINE>At public hearing, sex workers want legal means of living</HEADLINE>

      <P>A public hearing on the decriminalization of prostitution held in Taipei Monday
sparked a contentious debate, with sex workers asking to be given a legal way to
make a living and others pushing for legal changes to differing degrees.</P>
      <P>Nearly 200 people,  including scholars, sex trade workers, representatives of
women's groups and officials from the National Police Agency (NPA), participated
in the first of two hearings.</P>
      <P>The hearings are being organized by the Ministry of the Interior after Taiwan's
Constitutional Court ruled last November that a provision in the Social Order
Maintenance Act allowing punishment for prostitutes but not their patrons is
unconstitutional and must be invalidated within two years.</P>
      <P>The second public hearing is scheduled for Kaohsiung Aug. 31.</P>
      <P>Jeng Shann-yinn, a law professor at Kainan University, said he is in favor of
decriminalizing the sex trade but opposed to the idea of legalizing it.</P>
      <P>"Otherwise, if the trade is legalized, then it could run ads and run other
promotional activities," Cheng said.</P>
      <P>A sex trade worker, who was only identified by her surname Pan, accused the
government of squeezing the lowest echelon of society and the economically
disadvantaged.</P>
      <P>Pan, in tears, requested that police no longer go after her and others in her
position so that they can have a way to make a living.</P>
      <P>Pearl Buck Foundation Chairman Yu Ing-fu said he is in favor of decriminalizing
the sex trade if complementary measures are included.</P>
      <P>"If necessary, it should be decided by public referendum, " Yu said.</P>
      <P>Hung Hsin-ping, a representative of the Taipei Women's Rescue Foundation,
advocated punishment for patrons but not prostitutes to protect the exploited.</P>
      <P>Hung wondered how the NPA could maintain social order if the sex trade were
manipulated by a gang and how the authorities could deal with the situation?</P>
      <P>Chung Chun-chu, executive director of the Collective of Sex Workers and
Supporters (COSWAS) , said places for conducting the sex trade should be
regulated.</P>
      <P>The authorities  should  be lax on individuals  and small collectives, but
strict on large groups, Chung contended.</P>
      <P>Huang Tsung-jen, an NPA section chief, said sex workers complain about being
raided by policemen, but members of the public have also said their quiet lives
are being affected by the sex trade workers.</P>
      <P>"Whether we're cracking down on the prostitutes or not, we will be blamed,"
Huang said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, related polls conducted by the Ministry of the Interior showed that
48.2 percent of respondents supported the sex workers' right to work compared
with 43.3 percent who were opposed.</P>
      <P>The attitude of local governments also differ starkly, with Taipei and Chiayi
cities opposing setting up special zones for the sex trade, while Kaohsiung,
Hsinchu, and Taichung cities and Taipei, Taichung,  Tainan, Pingtung and Penghu
counties supporting the establishment of special zones like the ones in
Amsterdam.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's Yulon Motor Co. has received the approval of Chinese authorities to set
up a joint venture in China to manufacture vehicles, the Taiwanese car marker
said in a statement Monday.</P>
      <P>The approval will allow Yulon to promote vehicles under its self-developed
Luxgen brand, marking the first time that a Taiwanese auto brand has set up
production overseas, local news reports said.</P>
      <P>The statement came after Beijing's National Development and Reform Commission
reportedly granted the green light on July 26 to the establishment of Dongfeng
Yulon by Yulon and China's Dongfeng Motor Corp, China's fourth largest automaker
by sales.</P>
      <P>With half of its shares controlled by Yulon, Dongfeng Yulon would churn out
120,000 vehicles annually at the first stage of its plan, the statement said.</P>
      <P>The first-stage preparation is expected to be completed by next year, the
statement noted.</P>
      <P>Experts predict that Dongfeng Yulon will help increase the number of new
vehicles sold by Yulon in Taiwan and China from 30,000 a year to more than
150,000, Taiwan's Chinese-language United Evening News noted.</P>
      <P>This will make Yulon one of the top 15 carmakers in the greater China area, the
report said.</P>
      <P>The establishment of the joint venture will also be beneficial to auto part
makers in Taiwan as they can sell their products to China, the statement added.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, Yulon is also the dealer for Japanese brands Nissan and Mitsubishi
and American brands Buick and Cadillac.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, China's reported approval sent Yulon shares up by the
maximum 7 percent to close at NT$39.40, setting an eight-month high.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's Chan Yung-jan and China's Zheng Jie lost a hotly contested doubles
finals at the WTA's Bank of West Classic Sunday in Stanford, California, but
their strong showing at the event hinted at their potential in this year's U.S.
Open.</P>
      <P>The second seeds were outlasted by the wild card pairing of Americans Lindsay
Davenport and Liezel Huber in the final 7-5, 6-7 (8) , 10-8, leaving them having
to settle for the runner-up prize money of US$17,800.</P>
      <P>Chan and Zheng jumped out to a 4-2 lead in the first set after breaking their
opponents' serve twice, but Davenport reversed the momentum with accurate
volleys to help the Americans win five of the set's last six games.</P>
      <P>The second set, in which Chan and Zheng offset their bigger adversaries'
advantage at net with well-placed lobs, went to a tiebreaker, in which the
Taiwanese/Chinese duo prevailed 10-8.</P>
      <P>In the third set super-tiebreaker (with the first team to 10 points winning the
set) , Chan and Zheng fell behind 4-0 before rallying to even the score at 5-5
and 8-8.</P>
      <P>But Davenport, a former world No. 1 in both singles and doubles, won her serve
on match point to clinch victory and the US$34,000 first prize.</P>
      <P>It was the second consecutive year Chan made it to the Bank of West doubles
finals. She and Monica Niculescu of Romania were defeated for the title last
year by the Williams sisters.</P>
      <P>From the time she and Chuang Chia-jung ended their vaunted partnership in
September 2008, Chan played with 14 different new partners in an elusive search
for doubles success before joining together with Zheng, one of China's top
female doubles players, in February 2010.</P>
      <P>They reached the round of 16 at the French Open and lost in the first round at
Wimbledon, but they hope their performance in Stanford bodes well for their
prospects at the final major of the year, the U.S. Open, which begins later this

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's government needs to make it illegal to keep wild animals in captivity
for private purposes, a foreign animal activist urged on Monday after local
animal conservationists exposed several places where wild animals were being
held in poor conditions.</P>
      <P>According to the Environment and Animal Society of Taiwan (EAST), a recreational
farm operator in Tainan County and an individual in Chiayi County are keeping
several wild animals -- Malayan sun bears, Formosan black bears, Formosan rock
monkeys, tigers, and rare birds, in private captivity.</P>
      <P>The animals, said EAST, are kept in extremely inhumane conditions and suffer
from severe physical and psychological trauma.</P>
      <P>EAST said they have pictures of a 20-year-old Malay sun bear in Jhuci Township
caged in a 3.3-meter-wide 1.5-meter-tall steel bar cage.</P>
      <P>"The bear is unable to walk about and is forced to stand on its feet almost the
entire day. The paws are also infected. The eyes are covered with a thin white
film," the group said.</P>
      <P>EAST has appealed to several international organizations such as the World
Society for the Protection of Animals (WSPA) on behalf of the animals.</P>
      <P>In a letter responding to the pictures of the bears in captivity provided by
EAST, Victor Watkins, the wildlife adviser of WSPA in the United Kingdom, said
the bears are being kept in "totally inadequate conditions."</P>
      <P>"These are adult bears that need a natural habitat to live in. Even if they are
captive animals they should be kept in a large enclosure with earth, trees, and
large water pools with plenty of areas to hide away from the heat of the day and
the cold weather of winter," Watkins said.</P>
      <P>The close-up pictures of one of the Malayan sun bear's paws indicate that the
paws are infected and dry, and the split claws could cause further infection, he
said.</P>
      <P>"This happened because the bear does not have any natural substrate to walk on.
The bears have to stand on metal bars and also on the concrete cage floor --
which when wet can cause the paws to become raw and infected," he wrote.</P>
      <P>The bear specialist urged Taiwan's government to outlaw private ownership of
wild animals and stressed the importance of having strict welfare guidelines and
regular veterinarian care even for animals in zoos.</P>
      <P>The International Union for Conservation of Nature in 2007 listed sun bears as
"vulnerable, " which means the species is likely to become endangered unless the
circumstances threatening its survival and reproduction improve.</P>
      <P>Bear paws, along with other wild animal body parts, such as tiger penises and
tiger bones, have long been used in Chinese medicine as an elixir or a
supplement. In Taiwan, however, any use of wild animals for medicinal purposes
is illegal.</P>

      <P>Facing public outcry over reports of government measures that would force
aboriginal tribes to move from their homes, Premier Wu Den-yih said Monday that
there was no such policy.</P>
      <P>"The government respects the choices of the victims" of massive flooding
triggered by Typhoon Morakot last August, Wu said.</P>
      <P>Wu's comments followed a China Times report on Monday that said the Indigenous
Peoples Action Coalition of Taiwan (IPACT) accused the government of "cutting
off aboriginals' links with the land."</P>
      <P>The government's post-Morakot reconstruction projects involve relocating people
from locations destroyed by flooding if scholars, experts and tribal leaders
define the places as "dangerous areas."</P>
      <P>Wu mentioned new homes that were built for victims from Kaohsiung County's
Jiasian Township and Pingtung County's Changjhih Township, saying the residents
"had a free choice and moved of their own volition."</P>
      <P>There are also settlement programs for people living in the areas that were
classified by experts and scholars as vulnerable to natural disasters but not
thought so by the locals, Wu added.</P>
      <P>He said that people residing in "dangerous areas" are allowed to stay if they
wish, but are obliged to relocate to a safer place whenever there is the threat
of a typhoon, landslide or flooding.</P>
      <P>Wu added that "if they choose to move to a safer place at any time in the next
three years, the government will help them relocate."</P>
      <P>The China Times report cited the IPACT as saying that in the past year, the
government had initiated and implemented the relocation policy too hastily
because it was eager for quick success and instant benefits.</P>
      <P>The civic group said it "hurt the heart" that the government "never tried to
think from the viewpoint of the indigenous people when outlining the
reconstruction policy."</P>
      <P>Saying the only goal of the reconstruction policy was forcing the aboriginals to
move away from their villages on mountains, the IPACT blasted the relocation
measures as "rude and crude" while pointing out that not all the flood-affected
areas should be classified as "dangerous areas."</P>
      <P>The organization plans a protest rally on Ketagalan Boulevard in front the
Presidential Office on Aug. 6-7, the report said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of National Defense (MND) dismissed a media report Monday that said
the military has begun planning a confidence-building mechanism with China and
would issue a "wish list" asking China to dismantle weapons targeting Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The ministry was referring to an article carried in the Monday edition of the
Taipei-based China Times daily that said Taiwan's national security and military
authorities had in late June secretly started preparatory work for forging a
confidence-building mechanism with China.</P>
      <P>Citing "authoritative government sources, " the paper said the military would
not only ask China to dismantle its missiles targeting Taiwan but also ask China
to remove command, control, communications and intelligence systems, warships
and military aircraft targeting Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In future negotiations, the paper said, the military will come up with a wish
list detailing weaponry that Taiwan would demand China dismantle or relocate.</P>
      <P>The MND, however, said in a press statement that the report was not true.</P>
      <P>The ministry  said  that crafting  a cross-Taiwan  Strait confidence-building
mechanism is a national issue involving national security, and that the military
will strictly follow government policy guidelines that prioritize economic
topics over political issues, urgent trouble over less hasty issues, and easy
problems over difficult topics.</P>
      <P>The military will coordinate with the government in promoting cross-strait
exchanges, the statement added.</P>
      <P>Lawmakers were divided over the newspaper report. Shuai Hua-ming, a ruling
Kuomintang (KMT) lawmaker who used to be a senior army officer, questioned the
credibility of the report.</P>
      <P>"I do not think that the military would prepare such a wish list because Taiwan
has no clout to force China to accept such demands, " Shuai said.</P>
      <P>As to when Taiwan and China would start political talks after signing a landmark
economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) last month, Shuai said he
believes such talks would not begin any time soon.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan would be willing to address cross-strait political issues only after the
ECFA generates substantial economic benefits, " Shuai said.</P>
      <P>Another KMT lawmaker, Lin Yu-fang, said the "wish list" overture was an MND
response to China's recent proposal that issues concerning the removal of
missiles targeting Taiwan can be discussed under the "one China" precondition.</P>
      <P>"The MND has conventionally been cool toward China's missile removal overture
because such proposals are empty talk given the fact that missiles are highly
mobile and could simply be redeployed very quickly at any time," Lin said.</P>
      <P>By floating a "wish list" proposal, Lin said, the MND was tossing a hot potato
back to China.</P>
      <P>Legislator  Ker  Chien-ming  of the  opposition  Democratic Progressive Party
said Taiwan does not need to respond to China's missile withdrawal overture
because Taiwan should never come into cross-strait talks under Beijing's "one
China" principle.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's top negotiator with China reiterated at a seminar on Monday the
country's desire to take part in the economic integration of the region, but a
Chinese official taking part in the forum did not respond to the plea.</P>
      <P>Chiang Pin-kung, chairman of the Straits Exchange Foundation, which is in charge
of Taiwan's dealings with China, said the economic cooperation framework
agreement (ECFA) recently signed with China provides it an opportunity to
compete with Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) members in China on
an equal footing.</P>
      <P>Chiang said, however, that more needs to be done because the region is
integrating economically, with China, South Korea, Japan, India, Australia and
New Zealand, trying to form a regional trade bloc with ASEAN.</P>
      <P>"Rather than being excluded from the process, Taiwan would like to take part in
it and beat Japan and South Korea to the punch, " Chiang said.</P>
      <P>An active role for Taiwan in the region would preserve the dynamism of its
economy and strengthen its confidence in cooperating more closely on trade with
China, to the benefit of both sides, Chiang said.</P>
      <P>He contended that such cooperation will lay a solid foundation for the peaceful
development between Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>Zhang Mingqing, the vice president of China's Association for Relations Across
the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) and the head of China's delegation to the seminar,
did not respond to Chiang's appeal.</P>
      <P>Instead, he lauded the conclusion of the ECFA in his speech, calling it a
milestone in ties between Beijing and Taipei that will set a new stage for
bilateral relations.</P>
      <P>The trade pact, clinched on June 29, is a preliminary form of free trade pact
and an attempt by the two sides to institutionalize their trade relations.</P>
      <P>Taiwan hopes the pact will help it negotiate similar trade pacts with other
states, but Beijing has been reluctant to see it sign pacts with other states
fearing they would give international legitimacy to Taiwan's push to be
recognized as a sovereign state.</P>
      <P>The annual seminar on China's modernization, which opened here on Monday, was
jointly staged by ARATS and the private Academic Foundation for Advancing
Chinese Modernization in Taipei.</P>

      <P>A Taichung man, who was confirmed as having an acute infection of the intestine
called shigellosis that he picked up in Indonesia, has been treated and cured,
the Taichung City Bureau of Health said Monday.</P>
      <P>Bureau officials said the man was part of a 16-member tour group that visited
Bali July 7-11, After the group's return, four of its members developed fevers,
stomach aches and diarrhea, and three were later diagnosed with shigellosis.</P>
      <P>Inadequately cooked food at a barbecue on July 10 was suspected to be the cause
of infection.</P>
      <P>After confirming that the Taichung resident was suffering from the intestinal
ailment, health officials tested people who had come in contact with the man and
disinfected his house.</P>
      <P>Shigellosis has an incubation period of 12 to 96 hours, but it can sometimes
last up to one week. Possible symptoms include diarrhea, fever, nausea,
vomiting, cramps, and blood in one's stool.</P>
      <P>The Centers for Disease Control again reminded travelers to Southeast Asia and
other tropical areas to pay particular attention to personal hygiene.</P>
      <P>Simple precautions such as washing one's hands before meals and avoiding
uncooked or unhygienic food can help avoid getting infected by shigella

    <HEADLINE>Chinese scholars support Ma's proposal on Chinese characters</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Several scholars from China voiced support Monday for an idea broached by
President Ma Ying-jeou last year that it would be better for Chinese speakers
to know traditional characters in general but to write them in simplified form.</P>
      <P>Scholars in Taiwan and China have long argued over the merits of the two writing
systems. Traditional characters are prevalent in Taiwan and Hong Kong, while
simplified characters are used in China and Singapore.</P>
      <P>At a seminar at Shih Chien University  in Taipei on the modernization of China,
Zheng Liang, director of the Chinese Language and Literature  program at Xiamen
University,  said simplified characters have historical roots, as about 70
percent of them appeared in ancient Chinese books.</P>
      <P>He also argued that traditional characters have not remained intact, changing
periodically to simpler forms.</P>
      <P>Zheng Lianghe, deputy director of the Chinese Language and Literatures
Department at North China University of Technology, said many Chinese schools
have actually asked students to gain familiarity with traditional characters
even though only simplified characters are officially taught and written.</P>
      <P>In fact, he said, traditional and simplified characters co-exist in today's
China since most Chinese academic institutions involved in researching history
and ancient books are adopting traditional characters.</P>
      <P>"The Chinese academic world is generally in support of Ma's call for
'recognizing traditional and writing simplified characters, '" he said,
referring to a comment Ma made in June 2009 during a meeting with American-
Chinese representatives.</P>
      <P>Honorary professor Fu Hsi-jen of Taiwan's Tamkang University, said Chinese
characters have undergone "reforms" since ancient times, with simplification
more frequently adopted than "complication."</P>
      <P>In China, he said, government authorities have dominated national cultural
policies, in contrast to Taiwan where scholars generally playing the leading
role in cultural development.</P>
      <P>China therefore sees characters as a "tool, " emphasizing the principle of
convenient usage, Fu argued, while Taiwan insists on the "cultural significance"
of characters.</P>
      <P>The scholar acknowledged it will be impossible for either Taiwan or China to
convince the other to change its stand on Chinese characters.</P>
      <P>But he suggested traditional characters be taught first followed by their
simplified version, because it will be easier for students to recognize
simplified words after learning traditional characters than vice versa.</P>
      <P>Fu also called on Taiwanese schools to teach students to recognize simplified
characters and allow people to write freely using both forms of characters.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Golfer will return to share joy of winning British Open</HEADLINE>

      <P>The first Taiwanese golfer ever to win the Women's British Open said Sunday she
will return home in the near future to share her joy in capturing the coveted
title, which she described as the toughest triumph of her career.</P>
      <P>"The victory means a lot to me. It was at a very special coastal course in the
country where the sport originated. It also reflects an improvement in my game,
" Yani Tseng said in an interview with the Central News Agency after winning the
2010 Ricoh British Open at the Royal Birkdale Golf Club.</P>
      <P>"I talked to my parents by phone after my win and I'll return to Taiwan in one
or two months to share my joy with my family, my friends and fans and all those
who have helped me in my career, " a jubilant Tseng said.</P>
      <P>It was the 21-year-old's second major of the year and the third of her career.</P>
      <P>"I'm very happy to be able to clinch my third major in the third year of my
professional golf career, " said Tseng, who became the youngest player in
history to have captured three major titles.</P>
      <P>Her previous wins came in the 2008 LPGA Championship and the Kraft Nabisco
Championship in March this year.</P>
      <P>Tseng said her next goal is to win the U.S. Open Championship to complete the
career grand slam.</P>
      <P>"It is one of the tournaments I want to win the most. It won't be easy, but it
has long been a goal of mine. I hope I can become the world's top golfer and
ultimately make it into the Hall of Fame, " a confident Tseng said.</P>
      <P>"What I need to do now is to practice hard and move toward my goal step by
step."</P>
      <P>As for the British Open triumph, Tseng said the championship "means all of my
sweat and effort has paid off."</P>
      <P>She needed every bit of that effort and a bit of luck to prevail on Sunday.</P>
      <P>Tseng had played brilliantly over the first 54 holes, carding only one bogey in
shooting three consecutive 68s. She held four-shot leads after both the second
and third rounds and appeared to be on her way to a comfortable victory.</P>
      <P>But Tseng clearly suffered from nerves on Sunday, bogeying three of the first 10
holes, including missing a short putt for par on the 10th hole that left her
only two up on Katherine Hull of Australia, and when Hull birdied 13, the margin
was cut to one.</P>
      <P>With Tseng putting tentatively throughout the back nine, Hull had her chances to
pull even, but a birdie putt to tie at 17 lipped out, and her second shot on the
par-5 18th found a greenside bunker as Tseng was trying to recover from teeing
off into a fairway bunker.</P>
      <P>Even with Hull's run of bad luck, Tseng needed to sink a five-foot par putt on
18 to win, which she did, and she then broke into tears in her caddie's arms.</P>
      <P>"It was the toughest win I've had to date, " she recalled. "I usually come from
behind to win. I have never won from the front before. So I was nervous and
tired with the pressure and attention out there on the last day."</P>
      <P>She admitted that the pressure nearly got to her.</P>
      <P>"I was so tired and the last few holes were so hard, " an emotional Tseng said.
"I felt so much pressure out there and it's been an unbelievable day."</P>
      <P>But the challenge has enabled her to learn to be patient and composed.</P>
      <P>"I have learned to control my body language, to make myself look calm and look
like I'm enjoying playing, " Tseng said. She revealed that she even occasionally
sang Taiwanese pop hits to calm herself during Sunday's round.</P>

      <P>A drug developed by the National Health Research Institutes in Jhunan, Miaoli
County, has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for tests on
humans.</P>
      <P>Hsieh Hsing-pang, a researcher at the institutes' Division of Biotechnology and
Pharmaceutical Research told a news conference in Taipei Monday that the green
light came from Washington on July 30.</P>
      <P>The experiment is expected to be conducted at National Cheng Kung University
Hospital in Tainan City, he said.</P>
      <P>"When the experiment is completed within two years as scheduled, it will set a
precedent for a new drug being developed and produced, from beginning to end, in
Taiwan," Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>The small molecular drug, labeled DBPR104, was discovered by the body in 2001.</P>
      <P>The chemical was found to be able to inhibit the growth of abnormal blood
vessels in tumors and thereby cut off nutrients to the tumors and destroy them
gradually.</P>
      <P>In experiments on mice, the drug cut down the size of tumors to one-sixth of
their original size.</P>
      <P>This drug was transferred to a local pharmaceutical company for production in
2008 after it was patented by U.S. authorities in 2005.</P>
      <P>"The U.S. Food and Drug Administration's approval is recognition of the National
Health Research Institutes' ability to develop new drugs and a local
pharmaceutical company's ability to follow it through," Hsieh said proudly.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Remove missiles based on '92 consensus': presidential spokesman</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Presidential Office said Monday that Taiwan's people will not accept
Beijing's call to remove its missiles targeted at Taiwan only after Taiwan
accepts the "one China" principle.</P>
      <P>"It would be a crucial step toward advancing cross-strait relations if China
would take the initiative to remove its missile based on the '1992 consensus'
reached between the two sides, " Presidential spokesman Lo Chih-chiang said.</P>
      <P>He was responding to a statement made three days earlier by a Chinese military
spokesman calling for Taiwan to accept the "one China" principle before the
missiles could be moved.</P>
      <P>The "1992 consensus" refers to a tacit agreement reached between negotiators of
Taiwan and China in 1992 that "there is only one China but Taipei and Beijing
are allowed to have their respective definitions of one China."</P>
      <P>Beijing has always said that Taiwan and China have agreed to the "one China"
principle  while Taipei  has insisted  on freely interpreting the concept.</P>
      <P>The "consensus," which critics contend never existed, has served as the
foundation for Taiwan and China to reopen talks after President Ma Ying-jeou was
sworn in on May 2008.</P>
      <P>Lo said that peaceful and positive cross-strait engagement not only serves to
meet the expectations of the people on both sides but is also well accepted by
the international community.</P>
      <P>Lo called attention to the "inharmonious picture" in which over 1,000 missiles
are still deployed against Taiwan "amid this warming atmosphere, " and he urged
China to have the missiles removed or dismantled for the good of the cross-
strait ties.</P>
      <P>He reiterated President Ma Ying-jeou's  call for improving relations based on
the principles of "facing reality, building mutual trust, shelving differences
and creating a win-win situation."</P>

      <P>Taiwan's film industry launched a new trailer Sunday to thank movie fans for
choosing to watch movies at movie theaters or genuine DVDs at home and help the
sector survive.</P>
      <P>In the trailer, Taiwanese film director Doze Niu, who made the hit film Monga,
appealed to people to do the right thing.</P>
      <P>"Please support legitimate movies, not only for the sake of protecting the jobs
of those who work in the movie industry, but also for the purpose of being able
to enjoy many more touching movies," he said.</P>
      <P>The trailer also featured messages from others who work in the Taiwanese film
industry, including veteran cinema projector operator A-Kun, who said: "If you
continue to support genuine movies, I can carry on with my professional career."</P>
      <P>Mike Ellis, the president and managing director of the Motion Picture
Association, Asia Pacific, lauded the trailer as a worthwhile initiative that
shows the genuine appreciation of Taiwan's film industry of movie fans who make
a choice to watch content that has not been counterfeited.</P>
      <P>"By making that choice they are voting for a healthy film industry, and that is
beneficial to everyone," Ellis said.</P>
      <P>The video trailer will appear in all movie theaters on six television stations
in Taiwan. It can also be found on the Taiwan Foundation   Against   Copyright

      <P>Having made little progress in defusing the anger of Mailiao Township residents,
Premier Wu Den-yih said Monday that their concerns triggered by fires at a
nearby petrochemical complex could be resolved using methods to settle public
hazard disputes.</P>
      <P>A public hazard dispute settlement commission should be formed if the private
Formosa Petrochemical Corp. fails to reach an agreement with local residents on
pollution and damage caused by fires at the company's petrochemical complex in
the Yunlin County township last month, Wu said.</P>
      <P>County chief "Su Chih-fen should head the commission based on the law, " Wu
added, while talking about the latest accident at the complex, which was the
second of its kind in July.</P>
      <P>The fire, which broke out on July 25, reportedly caused serious air pollution
that people living in the the nearby area claimed has jeopardized their health
and caused great damage to coastal fish ponds in downwind areas.</P>
      <P>Wu reiterated that all relevant governmental agencies, including the county's
environmental protection bureau, quickly took measures to handle the accident.</P>
      <P>He said he himself ordered the oil refinery that was hit by the fire to cease
operations at once, referring to his meeting with Su and Formosa Petrochemical
executives July 30. He also requested the company to compensate local residents
for their losses and pay for health checkups.</P>
      <P>The measures, however, failed to ease the anger of Mailiao residents, who
blasted the oil refinery and petrochemical complex for having caused harm to
public safety.</P>
      <P>The complex is home to over 60 factories and facilities including three oil
refineries, three naphtha crackers, a co-generation plant, a thermal power plant
and the Mailiao Industrial Harbor.</P>
      <P>Members of a township self-help organization staged a protest outside the front
gate of the complex Sunday evening, calling for the complex to stop operations
entirely for safety checks.</P>
      <P>The activists also asked for the company to pay for local residents' health care
that is not covered by the National Health Insurance system.</P>

    <HEADLINE>At public hearing, sex workers want legal means of living</HEADLINE>

      <P>A public hearing on the decriminalization of prostitution held in Taipei Monday
sparked a contentious debate, with sex workers asking to be given a legal way to
make a living and others pushing for legal changes to differing degrees.</P>
      <P>Nearly 200 people,  including scholars, sex trade workers, representatives of
women's groups and officials from the National Police Agency (NPA), participated
in the first of two hearings.</P>
      <P>The hearings are being organized by the Ministry of the Interior after Taiwan's
Constitutional Court ruled last November that a provision in the Social Order
Maintenance Act allowing punishment for prostitutes but not their patrons is
unconstitutional and must be invalidated within two years.</P>
      <P>The second public hearing is scheduled for Kaohsiung Aug. 31.</P>
      <P>Jeng Shann-yinn, a law professor at Kainan University, said he is in favor of
decriminalizing the sex trade but opposed to the idea of legalizing it.</P>
      <P>"Otherwise, if the trade is legalized, then it could run ads and run other
promotional activities," Cheng said.</P>
      <P>A sex trade worker, who was only identified by her surname Pan, accused the
government of squeezing the lowest echelon of society and the economically
disadvantaged.</P>
      <P>Pan, in tears, requested that police no longer go after her and others in her
position so that they can have a way to make a living.</P>
      <P>Pearl Buck Foundation Chairman Yu Ing-fu said he is in favor of decriminalizing
the sex trade if complementary measures are included.</P>
      <P>"If necessary, it should be decided by public referendum, " Yu said.</P>
      <P>Hung Hsin-ping, a representative of the Taipei Women's Rescue Foundation,
advocated punishment for patrons but not prostitutes to protect the exploited.</P>
      <P>Hung wondered how the NPA could maintain social order if the sex trade were
manipulated by a gang and how the authorities could deal with the situation?</P>
      <P>Chung Chun-chu, executive director of the Collective of Sex Workers and
Supporters (COSWAS) , said places for conducting the sex trade should be
regulated.</P>
      <P>The authorities  should  be lax on individuals  and small collectives, but
strict on large groups, Chung contended.</P>
      <P>Huang Tsung-jen, an NPA section chief, said sex workers complain about being
raided by policemen, but members of the public have also said their quiet lives
are being affected by the sex trade workers.</P>
      <P>"Whether we're cracking down on the prostitutes or not, we will be blamed,"
Huang said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, related polls conducted by the Ministry of the Interior showed that
48.2 percent of respondents supported the sex workers' right to work compared
with 43.3 percent who were opposed.</P>
      <P>The attitude of local governments also differ starkly, with Taipei and Chiayi
cities opposing setting up special zones for the sex trade, while Kaohsiung,
Hsinchu, and Taichung cities and Taipei, Taichung,  Tainan, Pingtung and Penghu
counties supporting the establishment of special zones like the ones in
Amsterdam.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's Yulon Motor Co. has received the approval of Chinese authorities to set
up a joint venture in China to manufacture vehicles, the Taiwanese car marker
said in a statement Monday.</P>
      <P>The approval will allow Yulon to promote vehicles under its self-developed
Luxgen brand, marking the first time that a Taiwanese auto brand has set up
production overseas, local news reports said.</P>
      <P>The statement came after Beijing's National Development and Reform Commission
reportedly granted the green light on July 26 to the establishment of Dongfeng
Yulon by Yulon and China's Dongfeng Motor Corp, China's fourth largest automaker
by sales.</P>
      <P>With half of its shares controlled by Yulon, Dongfeng Yulon would churn out
120,000 vehicles annually at the first stage of its plan, the statement said.</P>
      <P>The first-stage preparation is expected to be completed by next year, the
statement noted.</P>
      <P>Experts predict that Dongfeng Yulon will help increase the number of new
vehicles sold by Yulon in Taiwan and China from 30,000 a year to more than
150,000, Taiwan's Chinese-language United Evening News noted.</P>
      <P>This will make Yulon one of the top 15 carmakers in the greater China area, the
report said.</P>
      <P>The establishment of the joint venture will also be beneficial to auto part
makers in Taiwan as they can sell their products to China, the statement added.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, Yulon is also the dealer for Japanese brands Nissan and Mitsubishi
and American brands Buick and Cadillac.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, China's reported approval sent Yulon shares up by the
maximum 7 percent to close at NT$39.40, setting an eight-month high.</P>

      <P>A dispute has recently emerged between Taiwan and China over the agreement
reached following  their latest talks on increasing cross-Taiwan Strait flights.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's negotiators  made a mistake by treating a "tacit understanding" that
was not spelled out in black and white as an agreed item. This was probably
because Taiwan had unrealistic expectations of China's offer of concessions.</P>
      <P>In addition, there was a lack of political sensitivity among Taiwan's
negotiators, which was demonstrated in their acceptance of China's request to
increase flights to Fuzhou and Xiamen, where there is limited demand for cross-
strait flights. Fuzhou and Xiamen are two of the core cities of China's plan to
develop an economic zone in the western side of the Taiwan Strait, and Taiwan
has been trying to avoid including related issues in cross-strait trade
negotiations.</P>
      <P>Also, the incident highlights the necessity of strengthening the participation
of legal professionals in trade negotiations.</P>

      <P>Environmental groups scored yet another victory Monday as the Taipei High
Administrative Court put the brakes on the third-phase expansion  of the Central
Taiwan  Science  Park (CTSP)  over environmental concerns.</P>
      <P>The move followed a similar ruling handed down by the court last Friday that
demanded suspension of the CTSP's fourth-phase expansion after residents at a
part of the planned construction site -- Siangshiliao  in Changhua County's
Erlin township --  strongly protested the appropriation of their land for the
project.</P>
      <P>Both rulings have sent shockwaves through the high-tech sector. Major companies
that have launched investment projects or are planning to build new production
facilities at the park's new expansion sites will fall victim to the court's
decisions.</P>
      <P>More alarming is that the suspension of the park's Houli and Erlin expansion
projects over land appropriation and environmental impact disputes has created
uncertainty in Taiwan's investment environment  and could affect the national
image and economic development in the long run, government officials and market
analysts said.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from the local media coverage of the issue:</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>The Supreme Administrative Court in January had already rescinded an initial
environmental impact assessment on the park's Houli construction project in
Taichung County's Houli township, more commonly known as the park's third-phase
expansion.</P>
      <P>The CTSP Administration, however, failed to immediately halt the complex's
development. Environmental groups and local residents then filed a lawsuit
against the CTSP Administration and the Environmental Protection Administration
(EPA) over pollution concerns.</P>
      <P>The Taipei High Administrative Court ruled Monday that the Chihsing development
project should be suspended because the EPA illegally exempted the CTSP
Administration from conducting a second environmental impact assessment before
the park submitted a public health risk assessment.</P>
      <P>In its ruling, the court argued that wastewater from factories to be located at
the Houli site will affect the water quality and environment of the nearby
residential community and farmland.</P>
      <P>CTSP Director-General Yang Wen-ke said his office will continue fighting against
the court ruling because some companies, including flat panel giant AU
Optronics, have already started to build production lines there.</P>
      <P>"Private  factory  construction  and  public  infrastructure construction in the
Houli complex will be suspended, " Yang said, adding that his office will help
other companies intending to invest in the region to switch to other industrial
zones. (Aug. 3, 2010).</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>AUO will be hardest hit by the suspension of the CTSP's third- and fourth-phase
expansion projects. The company has invested NT$200 billion (US$6.25 billion) to
build two 8.5-generation flat panel plants in the Houli complex, one of which
was originally scheduled to begin trial production in early November.</P>
      <P>The company also planned to build an 11th-generation flat panel factory in the
Erlin complex. After the two CTSP expansion projects were suspended, AUO's
overall investment projects, with planned capital expenditure of NT$600 billion,
will be delayed or even canceled.</P>
      <P>AUO Chairman Lee Kun-yao said it was incredible that the government's  key
development policy was overturned by another administrative branch.</P>
      <P>"This is unthinkable, " a bewildered Lee said, adding that he believes the
country's competitiveness will definitely be impacted.</P>
      <P>"Will the government's global drive to solicit investment after signing the ECFA
remain viable after all these disturbances? " Lee wondered.</P>
      <P>Another company that will be hurt by the ruling is Sunner Solar Co., which has
invested NT$2.5 billion at the Houli site to build a production facility.</P>
      <P>CTSP Director-General Yang said all construction projects have to be halted
until his office wins a lawsuit, which may take two years.</P>
      <P>"This will be a major growth pain for our overall national development, but we
have no choice but to endure it, " Yang said.</P>
      <P>Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>The National Science Council -- the administrative body of the country's science
parks -- announced Monday that construction at the Erlin site and the Houli
site's controversial Chihsing area will be suspended in line with the court's
latest rulings.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet-level council said it will stop soliciting investment in the two
areas but will appeal the verdicts.</P>
      <P>The CTSP Administration said development of the Erlin complex will be postponed
for two to three years.</P>
      <P>As to whether the Siangshiliao community will be included in the Erlin site, the
office said it will respect the opinion of residents in the community, which has
30-plus farming households. (Aug. 3, 2010).</P>

      <P>Taiwan's Yani Tseng became the youngest female golfer in history to win three
majors after capturing the Women's British Open, this past weekend, but her
victory was not enough to improve her world ranking.</P>
      <P>Tseng remained in the fifth spot in the Rolex world rankings, behind Jiyai Shin
of South Korea, Cristie Kerr of the United States, Ai Miyazato of Japan and
Suzann Pettersen of Norway.</P>
      <P>The ranking points Tseng picked up at the British Open, however, did help her
close the gap with the top four. Her weighted average points per event, the
complicated formula used to determine the rankings, soared from 8.35 to 9.93
with the victory, but the averages of the other four players still remained
slightly above 10.</P>
      <P>Tseng began professional career in 2007 and won her first major championship on
the LPGA Tour a year later. She has not fallen out of the top 10 in the world
rankings since then.</P>
      <P>Tseng vaulted to second in the rankings after clinching the year's first major,
the Kraft Nabisco Championship in early April, but she had only one top 5 finish
in her next seven events, and strong results by her closest rivals allowed them
to overtake her.</P>
      <P>The rankings are calculating on a weighted basis for events played over the past
two years, with tournaments held in the most recent 13 weeks given the most

      <P>Two recent incidents show that there is a very serious problem with Taiwan's
judiciary. One was a collective corruption scandal involving three judges and
the other a lenient sentence given to former Presidential Office Deputy
Secretary-General Chen Che-nan.</P>
      <P>In our opinion, judicial reform cannot be engineered by judicial personnel
themselves but should allow in forces from the outside.</P>
      <P>One of the problems with Taiwan's judicial circles is that they are too
technical and are often unfamiliar with society.</P>
      <P>This was demonstrated in the handling of Chen's case, in which Chen was found
guilty of promising to use his influence to settle two court cases involving a
business tycoon.</P>
      <P>His sentence was slashed to seven months from nine years in a recent re-trial by
the Taiwan High Court, after the presiding judge determined that Chen was guilty
of fraud rather than corruption, on grounds that his position did not involve
supervising or conducting judicial investigations and therefore the money he
took was unrelated to his job.</P>
      <P>Using this "logic" to de-link Chen's position from his influence over the
judiciary, the judge also cut off the connection between laws and society.</P>
      <P>Public discontent with "judicial alienation from society" is the main force
driving judicial reform today. In conducting reform, civil society's discontent,
expectations and criticism must be heeded.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Flat panel maker AU Optronics Corp. (AUO) urged the government on Tuesday to
take action to keep investors in Taiwan after a court ruling derailed plans to
expand a science park in central Taiwan where AUO planned to invest NT$600
billion.</P>
      <P>"AUO wants to stay in Taiwan and continue its investment in Taiwan. But it seems
that the government has failed to provide investors with a sound environment for
long-term development, " Hsiao Ya-wen, an AUO spokeswoman, told the Central News
Agency.</P>
      <P>"We hope the government can give us clear guidelines to follow as we are mapping
out our long-term investment plans in Taiwan, " Hsiao said.</P>
      <P>The company was forced to reassess its investment plans after the National
Science Council on Monday decided to suspend the Central Taiwan Science Park's
third and fourth phases of development.</P>
      <P>The council made the decision following a court injunction to suspend the park's
development plans after residents near the planned expansion sites sued the
government for failing to present a reliable environmental impact assessment and
charged that the park's expansion would harm their health.</P>
      <P>The council said it will continue efforts to resolve the dispute with local
residents.</P>
      <P>AUO has already started work on an 8.5-generation flat panel plant at the site
of the third phase of the science park's expansion in Houli, Taichung County,
and was scheduled to install production equipment at the end of the year.</P>
      <P>It planned to build another 8.5-generation plant at the same location, with the
two plants expected to cost the company NT$200 billion (US$5.25 billion).</P>
      <P>AUO also planned  to invest NT$400 billion  to build two 11th-generation flat
panel plants and solar energy-related facilities at the site of the fourth phase
of the park's expansion in Erlin, Changhua County.</P>
      <P>The NT$400 billion project has been seen as AUO's commitment to use Taiwan as
its hub for long-term development while at the same time seeking government
approval to build a 7.5-generation plant in China's Kunshan.</P>
      <P>AUO estimated that the planned NT$600 billion in investment would have created
about 6,000 new jobs.</P>
      <P>"The government has to find solutions to resolve environmental disputes and
reach a balance between economic development and environmental protection,"
Hsiao said.</P>
      <P>"The suspension of development of the Central Taiwan Science Park will not only
have an impact on AUO but also on other investors. We need the government to
tell us what to do now," Hsiao said.</P>
      <P>Apart from AUO, several others, including rival Chimei Innolux Corp. and
Chunghwa Picture Tubes Ltd, memory chip maker Winbond Electronics Corp. and chip
packager Siliconware Precision Industries Co., have expressed an interest in
investing at the science park's Erlin site.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's top envoy to the European Union and Belgium called Monday for a free
trade agreement (FTA) between Taiwan and the EU, saying that the ground has
already been laid with the recent signing of a trade pact with China.</P>
      <P>In an exclusive interview with Lukas de Vos, a senior editor at a Belgium
broadcasting company VRT, Y. L. Lin said Taiwan has a deep sense that its
signing of an economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) with China in late
June has helped to create a foundation for FTAs with other countries.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan has a high degree of willingness to clinch FTAs with its major trade
partners, including the EU, the United States, Japan and the member states of
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)," Lin said.</P>
      <P>However, he said, the Taiwan government should first seek to remove the barriers
to an FTA with the EU, adding that an annual two-way trade consultation
conference will serve as a good platform to launch the initiative.</P>
      <P>Lin also urged that Taiwan be allowed to join the International Civil Aviation
Organization (ICAO) as an observer and make a contribution to the world in that

      <P>Taiwan share prices closed up 0.57 percent Tuesday after a surge on Wall Street
overnight, but the gains were limited as the index approached the technical
resistance level of 8,000 points, dealers said.</P>
      <P>The weighted  index rose 45.85 points to 7,957.53,  after fluctuating between
7,915.83 and 7,970.58, on turnover of NT$142.81 billion (US$4.49 billion).</P>
      <P>The market opened up 0.63 percent with interest focusing on old economy stocks,
while buying in select high-tech heavyweights appeared slow on their relatively
high valuations, dealers said.</P>
      <P>However, the market fluctuated in a narrow range throughout the trade as
investors were unwilling to chase prices on fears of a possible pullback as the
index approached the 8,000 point mark, they said.</P>
      <P>A total of 2,377 stocks closed higher and 1,277 lower, while 281 remained
unchanged.</P>
      <P>The textile sector posted the largest gains of 1.7 percent. The construction
sector gained 1.6 percent, the foodstuff sector 1.3 percent, the cement sector
1.0 percent, and the plastics and chemical sector 0.9 percent.</P>
      <P>The paper and pulp sector rose 0.7 percent, the financial sector 0.6 percent,
and the machinery and electronics sector 0.3 percent.</P>
      <P>"As the local bourse rose 1.94 percent Monday ahead of Wall Street's latest
rebound, many investors today have turned cautious to some extent about possible
profit taking, " Taiwan International Securities analyst Michael Chiang said.</P>
      <P>"Market attention is now shifting to the U.S. non-farm payroll report, which is
due Friday, for more information to gain a clearer picture of the global
economic fundamentals," Chiang said.</P>
      <P>Rotational buying became active, lifting non-high-tech stocks, such as the
construction and steel sectors, while interest in the financial sector seemed to
have faded from the previous session, he said.</P>
      <P>"Investors remain optimistic about the earnings outlook of these old economy
stocks which have built close business ties with China, " Chiang said.</P>
      <P>He said Taiwan's signing of an economic cooperation framework agreement with
China in late June is still serving as a driving force to strengthen old economy
stocks to offset the impact on the broader market from institutional  investors'
move to cut holdings in high-tech stocks.</P>
      <P>In the construction sector, Kuo Yang Construction rose 3.27 percent to NT$20.55

League Foundation said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Citing the results of a recent survey, the foundation said 70 percent of
children under the age of 12 play online games and 74 percent of parents with
children of that age worry about this activity.</P>
      <P>In addition, 89 percent of parents think there are not many online games that
are suitable for children under 12, the poll found.</P>

unsuitable for children under six years of age; suitable for children between

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan and China have decided to speed up their pace of working together to
develop solar and wind energy so as to tap into the fast growing green energy
market, a research organization said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chu Hsin-sen,  executive vice president  of the Industrial Technology Research
Institute (ITRI) , said both sides of the Taiwan Strait have agreed to set up
task forces to conduct extensive dialogue on the effort, instead of meeting just
once a year.</P>
      <P>Representatives from Taiwan and China's solar and wind energy sectors have been
holding annual meetings to discuss technology development. But, Chu said, this
process has been slow and greater interaction is needed to speed up cooperation
in the field of green energy.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's task force will be assembled by the government-funded ITRI, while
China's will be organized by its National Development and Reform Commission.</P>
      <P>At a seminar in Nanjing last week, Taiwan and China signed several memoranda of
understanding to allow for cooperation on green energy and the establishment of
the task forces.</P>
      <P>Chu said both sides plan to establish a certification system for solar and wind
energy production and to work on a prototype for a 5-megawatt offshore wind
farm.</P>
      <P>They will also work jointly to develop an 8-megawatt offshore wind farm, he
added.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and China took a 50 percent share of the global solar panel market in
2009, Chu said, adding that their market share is expected to rise to 60 percent
in 2010 and 65 percent in 2011.</P>

      <P>Kaohsiung Magistrate Yang Chiu-hsing shocked his opposition Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) comrades Tuesday by saying that he is "just a step away"
from officially announcing his bid to run in the year-end mayoral election of
the Kaohsiung special municipality in defiance of his party.</P>
      <P>"After a long internal conflict, I have arrived at the decision (on whether to
run) , which will be formally announced at an appropriate time, " Yang, who lost
to incumbent Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu in the DPP primary, told reporters that
same day.</P>
      <P>"My supporters just cannot accept the result of the primary, as it was unfair,
and as a son of Kaohsiung, it is my mission not to let it continue to
deteriorate, " Yang said, adding that "I hope I can turn Kaohsiung into `second
Singapore.'"</P>
      <P>Yang's words hit a nerve with the DPP and Chen.</P>
      <P>The Kaohsiung special municipality, which will consist of the southern Taiwan
city and county, has long been a stronghold of the DPP, which considers a
victory in the coming election a virtual certainty with Chen as the candidate.</P>
      <P>But a split of the DPP votes between Chen and Yang might give ruling Kuomintang
(KMT) candidate Huang Chao-shun the edge she needs to achieve a win in the
election.</P>
      <P>"I will not give up any chance to communicate with Yang to reach solidarity
behind party lines on the election issue, " Chen said in response to press
queries.</P>
      <P>"The elections  in Kaohsiung  and the other  four special municipalities will
serve as a test for the performance of President Ma Ying-jeou, and it is crucial
for the opposition camp to reach common ground in the election," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Chen's  campaign  spokesman  Chao Tien-lin  said Chen will demonstrate "the
utmost sincerity" to resolve the animosity between her and Yang that erupted
during the primary and persuade the magistrate to give up his election bid for
the good of the party as a whole.</P>
      <P>Tainan Mayor Hsu Tain-tsair, who also lost in the DPP primary for the Tainan
municipality election, accused the party of placing itself in a difficult
situation by "forcing" Yang to choose to run. "It is the party that should be
doing some soul- searching," he said.</P>
      <P>"It's encouraging that Yang is vying for a chance to serve the people, and I
will give him my personal blessing, " said Hsu, who speculators have said will
run in the Tainan election against the DPP's wishes. Hsu, however, has refused
to say whether he has made a decision in this regard.</P>
      <P>DPP legislative whip Pan meng-an said the party's leaders "are making last ditch
efforts" to communicate with Yang.</P>
      <P>"I believe the magistrate, a well-experienced politician, will eventually make
the best choice," he said.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Chen Ting-fei urged the DPP leadership to make great efforts to
settle the matter as soon as possible so as to nip the crisis in the bud.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, KMT Secretary-General King Pu-tsung said that his party will do its
best to prepare for the coming election. "We should not count on victory from a
split in the opposition," he said.</P>
      <P>Huang for her part said that "it doesn't matter to me whether Yang runs or not."</P>

      <P>A senior economics official said Tuesday he does not expect the suspension of
the Central Taiwan Science Park's expansion to have much impact in the short
term on the review of flat panel maker AU Optronics Corp.'s application to
invest in China.</P>
      <P>The National Science Council (NSC) announced on Monday that it would suspend the
third and fourth phases of development at the science park as ordered by the
Taiwan High Court after residents sued the government for failing to present a
reliable environmental impact assessment.</P>
      <P>AUO has planned to spend NT$400 billion (US$12.57 billion) to build two 11th-
generation  flat panel plants and solar energy facilities at the site of the
park's fourth phase of expansion in Erlin, Changhua County.</P>
      <P>The NT$400 billion plan is seen as AU Optronics' commitment to use Taiwan as a
hub for its long-term investment at the same time that it seeks approval from
the government to build a 7.5-generation plant in China's Kunshan.</P>
      <P>Hwang Jung-chiou, vice minister of economic affairs, said he does not expect the
science park's problems to disrupt the review of AUO's China investment
application  because the environmental  impact assessment cited by the court was
unrelated to the investor.</P>
      <P>Hwang leads a technology committee that is in charge of reviewing AUO's
application.</P>
      <P>In February, the government relaxed restrictions on local flat panel makers
investing in China, allowing them to build up to three 6th-generation or more
advanced plants in China, but applicants must preserve their technology lead
over China and promise further investment in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>AUO filed the application with the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) in March.</P>
      <P>After the NSC announcement, AUO called for the government to take action to keep
investors in Taiwan by finding solutions to the environmental disputes between
the science park and residents living near the expansion sites.</P>
      <P>"We hope the government can give us clear guidelines to follow as we are mapping
out our long-term investment plans in Taiwan, " Hsiao Ya-wen, an AUO
spokeswoman, told the Central News Agency earlier Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The MOEA admitted  the court ruling will no doubt affect investment sentiment in
the private sector, but it has to respect the judicial decision while appealing
it.</P>
      <P>Apart from the NT$400 billion project in Erlin, AUO has already started work on
an 8.5-generation plant at the site of the science park's third phase of
development in Houli, Taichung County, and has planned a second 8.5-generation
plant there.</P>
      <P>The two plants in Houli are expected to cost AUO about NT$200 billion.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Government officials pledged during an international  forum Tuesday to forge
closer participation  in international fishery organizations to prove Taiwan's
commitment as a responsible member of the global fishery community.</P>
      <P>"As an important player in the high seas fishing industry, Taiwan has been
promoting its partnerships in various organizations, " Council of Agriculture
(COA) Minister Chen Wu-hsiung said in his opening remarks at the opening
ceremony.</P>
      <P>The International Fishers' Forum (IFF), co-hosted by the Western Pacific
Regional Fishery Management  Council,  a U.S.  federal organization tasked with
managing and implementing laws governing fishing activity, and Taiwan's
Fisheries Agency under the COA, has brought together officials and scholars from
25 countries for the three-day forum.</P>
      <P>The forum is geared toward commercial  fishery  operators, management
authorities, experts in marine spatial planning, fishing technology  experts,
seafood retailer  representatives,  marine ecologists and fisheries scientists.</P>
      <P>Over the past decades, fishing has contributed greatly to Taiwan's food security
and economic stability, said Fisheries Agency Director-General James Sha.</P>
      <P>However, the country, which has one of the largest blue water fishing fleets in
the world, has been accused several times of over-fishing  and  fish  laundering
by  international  fishery organizations.</P>
      <P>The International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tuna (ICCAT)
decided in 2005 to cut Taiwan's bigeye tuna fishing quota of 14,900 tons in that
year by 70 percent to 4,600 tons. The sanction was not lifted until a year
later.</P>
      <P>According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Taiwan is full member of the
Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission, the International Scientific
Committee for Tuna and Tuna-like Species in the North Pacific Ocean and the
Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna. It has cooperator
status in the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission and the ICCAT.</P>
      <P>In addition, it is an observer in the North Pacific Anadromous Fish Commission
and an "invited expert" of the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission.</P>
      <P>The government has fine-tuned its fishery policy to make sure international
regulations are upheld and the sustainability of fish stocks is improved, Sha
said, adding that the forum is hopeful of deciding upon a "Taipei statement"
before its conclusion.</P>
      <P>In addition to improving the sustainability of fish stocks and protected species
with which these fisheries interact, the IFF also intends to bring the fishing
industry into the relatively new dialogue of marine spatial planning and
management -- a process that brings together multiple users of the ocean to
decide on how to make best use of ocean resources.</P>
      <P>"Marine spatial planning is a relatively new topic for us, but we are keen to
understand more about it and do the best we can to make our industry better, "
said Hsieh Wen-Jung, chairman of the Taiwan Deep Sea Tuna Longline Boat-Owners
and Exporters Association.</P>

      <P>The sales volume of books printed in the simplified Chinese characters used in
China is on the increase, according to the sale figures of local bookstores.</P>
      <P>Chen En-chyuan, president of the Publishing Association of the Republic of
China, said that the increase is because of a more open policy on importing
books from China.</P>
      <P>He added that the association has suggested that the government include
publishing issues such as import policies and piracy problems in the next round
of cross-strait negotitions on economic cooperation framework agreement.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan and China can both benefit from a more open market," Chen said.</P>
      <P>"Our bookstore sold about 100 simplified character books in one month in the
past, but now we sell over 1,000 per month, " said Hong Wei-yi, an employee of
the local Samin bookstore who is in charge of importing books from China.</P>
      <P>Simplified character books start being sold near university campuses several
years ago, but now several stores have extended their simplified books sections,
while stores such as the Shanghai Bookstore sell only simplified character
books.</P>
      <P>Samin extended the size of its simplified character department in June last
year, and this year is organizing its biggest book fair ever, which opened July
30 and will run through Aug. 15, featuring over 60,000 simplified books from
China.</P>
      <P>"We find that more local readers are reading simplified books, " Hong said,
adding that according to their best-selling list, novels are the most popular,
with over 10,000 sold in the first half of this year.</P>
      <P>Language books are in second place, with about 9,000 sold, followed by Chinese
medicine books, with about 8,000 sold, she said.</P>

      <P>The National Science Council (NSC) decided Tuesday to appeal against a court
order to suspend construction work at a science park in Taichung County's Houli
Township, which falls under the NSC's portfolio.</P>
      <P>After an emergency meeting with his aides Tuesday morning, NSC Minister Lee Lou-
chuang said the injunction handed down by the Taiwan High Administrative Court
Monday is controversial and should be challenged.</P>
      <P>The appeal will be filed with the Supreme Administrative Court by the Central
Taiwan Science Park Administration, of which the Houli science park is part, the
NSC said.</P>
      <P>In addition, Lee said, the NSC will ask the Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA) to conduct another environmental impact assessment within a month for the
Houli park, as required by law.</P>
      <P>If everything goes well, Lee said the assessment will be completed by October
and hopefully the construction work at Houli could resume.</P>
      <P>Even with a three-month interruption, the NT$300 billion (US$9.43 billion) TFT-
LCD factory complex under construction in the park by the giant manufacturer AU
Optronics Corp. should be able to begin operation early next year, according to
Lee.</P>
      <P>"However, the work on the park could be suspended for two or three years, which
would deal a hard blow to the country's economic development, " said Yang Wen-
ke, chief of the Central Taiwan Science Park Administration.</P>
      <P>AUO had already spent NT$200 billion on the complex and was preparing to recruit
workers for the factory when the court ordered a halt of all construction in the
park.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan High Administrative Court's injunction came after the Supreme
Administrative  Court annulled an environmental  impact assessment for the Houli
park in January this year on the grounds that it failed to consider the effects
of the project on the health of the area's residents.</P>
      <P>AUO Chairman K. Y. Lee, caught off guard by the court's injunction on Monday,
said it is hard to tell who is in charge in the country.</P>
      <P>"It is unbelievable that an investment project approved by one government
department could be overturned by another department, " he said.  "With such
flipflops,  how can the government convince foreigners to invest in this
country."</P>
      <P>It was the second blow delivered by the court in less than a month to the
government's efforts to attract more investment from abroad.</P>
      <P>On July 13, the Taiwan High Administrative Court ordered the Central Taiwan
Science Park to suspend its expropriation of land for its Erlin science park in
Changhua County until the environmental impact assessment was sorted out.</P>
      <P>The 635-hectare Erlin park is expected to accommodate Taiwan hi-tech companies,
including AUO which is planning to build an 11th generation TFT-LCD cpmplex
there at a cost of NT$400 billion.</P>
      <P>The Central Taiwan Science Park Administration has put on hold its plan to
solicit companies to set up in Erlin park, in light of the court ruling Monday.</P>
      <P>Lee said the Erlin park issue is relatively easy to manage, as no other
companies apart from AUO have committed to setting up there. AUO would be
persuaded to relocate to either the Tainan or Kaohsiung Science Park, he added.</P>
      <P>The administrative  court's rulings were welcomed by local environmentalists
but  were  considered  as  setbacks  to the administration of President Ma Ying-
jeou.</P>
      <P>The administration was already under pressure after a group of farmers from
Miaoli County held a vigil in Taipei July 17 in protest against a plan by the
county government to acquire their land for the construction of a science park.</P>
      <P>The administration was also blamed for the air pollution caused by a fire at a
naphtha cracker plant in Mailiao, Yunlin County on July 27.</P>
      <P>President Ma has said that protection of the environment is more important than
economic development, but Premier Wu Den-yih said Tuesday that his
administration will ensure that the production work of companies already
operating in the Houli science park will not be interrupted in any way.</P>
      <P>He also said the Erlin science park will go ahead with its plan to solicit
business, but it will not acquire farm land for expansion unless the land owners
agree.</P>
      <P>As to the question of whether the administrative court ruling should be
appealed, Wu said he will defer to the Environment Protection Agency and the
National Science Council.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>National Cheng Kung University Hospital (NCKUH) in southern Taiwan's Tainan City
announced Tuesday that it recently conducted two living donor kidney transplants
in a single day -- setting a precedent in Taiwan's history, but at the same time
underscoring a dearth of surgical talent in the country.</P>
      <P>The two procedures, which were carried out late last month, involved two mother-
daughter pairs. One daughter donated her kidney to her mother, while the other
case involved a donor mother and her recipient daughter.</P>
      <P>"It was the first time the hospital had completed two living donor kidney
transplants in one day, setting a Taiwan record, " said Lee Po-chang, director
of the NCKUH's Surgical Department.</P>
      <P>Lee, however, issued a warning, calling the record a sign of a shortage of well-
trained surgeons in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"The NCKUH made maximum efforts to carry out the two operations in one day, each
of which lasted eight hours and involved 10 doctors," he noted.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, Taiwan is facing an increasing shortfall in the supply of
qualified transplant surgeons due to a lack of new blood entering the
profession.</P>
      <P>"Few young doctors, particularly those in private hospitals, are willing to
devote their time to doing long-term research and entering the exhausting world
of the transplant expert," he pointed out.</P>
      <P>A very low percentage of local doctors are specialized in organ transplants, Lee
noted.</P>
      <P>For instance,  he said,  only 208 of the Taiwan Surgical Association's 5,418
members are also members of the Transplantation Society of Taiwan, an equivalent
of about 3.8 percent.</P>
      <P>A dozen other associations, such as the Taiwan Urological Association and the
Taiwan Surgical Society of Gastroenterology, also have very low ratios of
transplant surgeons, averaging no higher than 10 percent, according to Lee.</P>

      <P>"We pray for favorable wind and rain, for the country to prosper and the people
to live in safety, " said Lee, a former president of Academia Sinica, the
nation's highest research institute.</P>
      <P>However, "the wish seems getting more and more far away from us," Lee lamented
at a news conference in which he and many other scholars called for a halt on
the Kuokuang petrochemical project out of concern over ecology and human health.</P>
      <P>Lee is one of more than 1,000 scholars from around the country who signed a
petition demanding that the government stop constructing energy-consuming and
high-polluting petrochemical plants.</P>
      <P>Lee pointed out that both the frequency and scale of natural disasters have
expanded over the past half decade and that this has drawn the attention of
people around the world concerned about climate change.</P>
      <P>Lee cited a study by professor Liu Shaw-chen, an expert in atmospheric chemistry
and environmental changes, as saying that if the temperature rises by 1 degree
Celsius, the frequency of extreme weather will increase 10 times.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, global warming has been proved to result from carbon dioxide
(CO2) emissions. He noted that recent studies have found that once the global
CO2 concentration increases to 450 ppm, there is a 50 percent chance that the
Earth's temperature will rise by 2 degrees Celsius compared with the level prior
to the Industrial Revolution.</P>
      <P>The current CO2 concentration is 390 ppm, said Lee, who warned that it will take
less than 30 years to reach the danger point if the concentration rises 2 ppm to
3 ppm every year.</P>
      <P>Describing CO2 emissions as the most serious problem in the world at present,
Lee said that should the Kuokuang petrochemical project be carried out, Taiwan
will never reach the goal President Ma Ying-jeou set of "cutting Taiwan's CO2
emissions to 4 tons per capita by 2050."</P>
      <P>Lee expressed hope that the government can spend the money earmarked for the
petrochemical project on efforts to develop renewable energy and he pledged his
assistance in the development and production of clean energy.</P>
      <P>Also present at the press conference were Chou Chang-hung who heads the Academia
Sinica's Life Sciences Division, former National Science Council Minister Chen
Chien-jen, and professors from National Taiwan University and National Chung
Hsing University.</P>
      <P>In response to the opposition, Kuokuang Petrochemical Technology Co. Chairman
Chen Bao-Lang said the company attaches great importance to opinions from
scholars.</P>
      <P>However, he claimed that some of the scholars have not spent much time studying
the project and that what they know about the project comes mostly from media
reports.</P>
      <P>Some environmental protection activists provided the media with "uncertified,
exaggerated and untrue information" on the planned petrochemical complex, which,
according to Chen "disturbed the social order and caused people panic." He also
described the petition as "inappropriate."</P>
      <P>He urged those opposing the project to respect the professional judgment of
members of the Environmental Protection Administration's environmental review
commission and experts in the administration while reiterating Kuokuang's pledge
to protect the environment.</P>
      <P>The project was initiated by the state-run refinery CPC Corp., Taiwan to
relocate its crude refining plants in southern Taiwan's Kaohsiung City to
Changhua County by 2015, where it plans to invest NT$400 billion (US$12.57
billion) to construct the petrochemical complex.</P>

      <P>Whenever there is an election year in Taiwan, everything becomes the central
government's responsibility. This bizarre atmosphere is making normal people
lose their ability to speak in normal ways.</P>
      <P>An example is the July 25 fire at the Formosa Plastics Group's petrochemical
complex in Yunlin County, which led Yunlin County Magistrate Su Chih-fen to go
down on her knees and demand the Executive Yuan to deal with its aftermath.</P>
      <P>But is Su's action reasonable? According to the Air Pollution Control Act and
Water Pollution Control Act, local governments have considerable powers over the
regulation of pollutants.</P>
      <P>Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) figures show that of the NT$400
million in air pollution surcharges paid by Formosa Plastics between 2001 and
2010, 60 percent went to the Yunlin County government. In addition, the EPA
provided the county another NT$65 million in air pollution handling expenses.</P>
      <P>A normal society should not fear disputes and problems. What we are afraid of is
for society to lose its normal ability to resolve disputes and problems.

      <P>Many excellent senior high school graduates from Taiwan have been opting lately
to enroll in universities in China or Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>We can imagine the number will continue to increase given the fact that more
than 100 Chinese universities have begun accepting the results of Taiwan's
General Scholastic Ability Test as a criterion for admission starting this year.</P>
      <P>What worries us the most is that while Taiwan is pushing local talent out of the
country, it is blocking the inflow of talent from outside.</P>
      <P>Over the past 10 years, Taiwan has experienced an exodus to China of at least 1
million white-collar workers. While the government can do nothing about it, the
pro-independence camp in Taiwan has been vigorously  barring the admission of
Chinese students and the recognition of Chinese diplomas.</P>
      <P>This is unreasonable because it will greatly undermine Taiwan's competitiveness.

      <P>Officials from Taiwan and China will meet in the southeastern Chinese coastal
city of Xiamen Thursday to try and settle a dispute over an increase in direct
flights across the Taiwan Strait, Chinese civil aviation sources said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The Chinese delegation, to be headed by a department chief of the General
Administration of Civil Aviation of China, is scheduled to fly to Xiamen
Wednesday morning for the talks, the sources said.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese and Chinese civil aviation officials originally agreed in May to allow
carriers from each side to fly 50 additional nonstop cross-strait flights per
week starting in June to meet growing market demand.</P>
      <P>As part of the deal, carriers from each country have operated 14 new weekly
flights between Taipei's Songshan Airport and Shanghai's Hongqiao Airport
without incident since June.</P>
      <P>But China rejected most of the other new flights Taiwanese carriers applied to
operate under the deal because they did not meet Beijing's requirement that 20
of the 50 new flights serve Xiamen or Fuzhou.</P>
      <P>According to Taiwan's understanding  of the May agreement, however, it did not
require Taiwan's carriers to fly any additional flights to the two Chinese
cities since they were already operating a total of 22 weekly flights to those
destinations as part of their original quota of 135 flights per week.</P>
      <P>Chinese sources would not disclose Wednesday whether Taiwan's understanding of
the deal would be upheld, saying the answer would not be known until after
Thursday's meeting.</P>
      <P>After China's rejection of its carriers' applications, Taiwan retaliated,
ordering Chinese carriers to suspend 31 of their newly approved cross-strait
flights from Aug. 1 and the remaining five flights from Oct. 30.</P>
      <P>With the dispute disrupting the plans of Taiwanese and Chinese carriers, China
agreed to reopen talks on the issue.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Commercial Times: Barrier removal key to investment promotion</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>08/04/10  11:50:33
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>In line with President  Ma Ying-jeou's  "global investment promotion" policy, a
Taiwan delegation is in China to advertise investment opportunities in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>While the development is favorable, there are several aspects that are raising
our concerns.</P>
      <P>Over the past year, the government's effort to attract Chinese investment has
shown unsatisfactory results partly because too many restrictions remain in
place. These restrictions can be traced to a long-time psychological barrier --
concerns that Taiwan's economy might fall under China's control.</P>
      <P>In addition, it appears that the government is not fully prepared for the
investment promotion plan. This is demonstrated in the discrepancies  between
the Council for Economic  Planning  and Development and the Government
Information Office on the content of the plan.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the recent string of disputes surrounding the Formosa Plastics
Group's petrochemical operations in Yunlin County, the expansion of the Central
Taiwan Science Park and the development of the Kuokuang Petrochemical Park have
increased the uncertainty in Taiwan's investment environment.</P>
      <P>All these problems or barriers must be overcome. Otherwise, investment promotion
efforts will be futile. (Editorial abstract -- Aug. 4, 2010)</P>

    <HEADLINE>Talk of the day -- Impact of Kaohsiung magistrate's electoral bid</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>08/04/10  12:27:00
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Kaohsiung County Magistrate Yang Chiu-hsing of the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) said Tuesday he has made up his mind to run in the Nov.
27 Kaohsiung municipality mayoral election as an independent.</P>
      <P>It was the first time that Yang publicly confirmed his intention to throw his
hat in the ring since he lost the DPP primary in early May to Kaohsiung City
Mayor Chen Chu.</P>
      <P>His announcement has posed a challenge to the DPP because it could split its
support base in Kaohsiung, but the results of an opinion poll conducted by the
United Daily News Tuesday evening show that Yang's electoral bid might have a
greater impact on the ruling Kuomintang candidate Huang Chao-shun than Chen.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung  City and Kaohsiung  County,  both of which are traditional DPP
strongholds, will be merged later this year to become a special municipality as
part of a major administrative district restructuring plan.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from the local media coverage of the issue:</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>This paper interviewed 852 residents of Kaohsiung City and Kaohsiung County in
the poll to explore their voting interest in the November mayoral election. The
poll has a 95 percent confidence level, with a margin of error of plus or minus
3.4 percent.</P>
      <P>The poll found that if the election is a traditional "blue vs. green or KMT vs.
DPP" race, Chen holds a commanding 52 percent to 19 percent lead, with 28
percent of respondents undecided.</P>
      <P>Compared with the outcome of a poll conducted in early May, Chen's support
rating showed little change, but Huang's declined 4 percent.</P>
      <P>According to Tuesday's poll, Chen would still be the frontrunner in a three-way
race with 44 percent of the vote, followed by Yang with 23 percent and Huang
with 13 percent. Nineteen percent of respondents were undecided.</P>
      <P>An in-depth analysis of the poll results showed that the impact of Yang's
electoral bid would be greater on the KMT than on the DPP, as only 18 percent of
Chen's supporters said they would switch their votes to Yang while 30 percent of
Huang's supporters said they would do so.</P>
      <P>By area, 31 percent of respondents residing in Kaohsiung County said they would
vote for Yang, a two-term head of the southern Taiwan county, compared to 37
percent who favored Chen.</P>
      <P>However, only 17 percent of respondents in Kaohsiung City backed Yang, leaving
him far behind the city's incumbent mayor.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Yang was competitive with Chen in only the 30-39 age bracket. Chen had
more support than Yang in all other age groups, and more than 60 percent of
respondents under 30 backed her.</P>
      <P>Even if Yang joins the race and splits the pan-green vote, 53 percent said they
believe Chen will still emerge as the winner.</P>
      <P>Only 11 percent said they thought Yang would win the three-way race, and only 9
percent felt Huang would win. Another 26 percent said the result would remain
unclear. (Aug. 4, 2010).</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>According to DPP elders who have tried hard in recent weeks to persuade Yang to
drop his electoral bid, one of the main reasons behind Yang's decision to throw
his hat into the ring is that he does not believe his nine years in office were
inconsequential.</P>
      <P>Yang is the only local government chief who has received a five-star rating in
four consecutive years in a nationwide annual survey conducted by a major media
group, and he has not been able to accept that with such credentials, he could
lose the DPP's primary to Chen Chu by a wide margin.</P>
      <P>He has on many occasions questioned the fairness of the DPP primary, which was
based on the results of opinion polls conducted by three selected polling
companies.</P>
      <P>Another reason prompting Yang to run was strong lobbying from some influential
figures in the KMT-led pan-blue camp, including Buddhist Master Hsing Yun and
many KMT township chiefs.</P>
      <P>With the KMT nominee Huang ranking at the bottom in many opinion polls,  Yang
and his aides believe that KMT supporters might eventually switch their votes to
him in the final stages of the race. (Aug. 4, 2010).</P>
      <P>Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>Responding to Yang's announcement Tuesday, Chen said she will take any
opportunity to communicate with Yang and will pay him a visit to show her
sincerity in cooperating with him in developing Kaohsiung municipality into one
of the world's top metropolises.</P>
      <P>In the KMT camp,  Huang gave a cool response  to Yang's announcement, saying she
will continue her campaign activities as scheduled without worrying about Yang's
electoral bid.</P>
      <P>KMT Secretary-General King Pu-tsung said the party will not rely on a split in
the DPP camp to try and win victory but will instead redouble efforts to win
voter support. (Aug. 4, 2010).</P>

      <P>The planned move by financial authorities to allow local insurers to buy stocks
and bonds in China is expected to help the insurance sector lower risk by
diversifying their investment portfolios, analysts said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>"China remains a fast growing economy. After recent consolidation in its stock
market, it is more likely for share prices there to go up," Hua Nan Securities
analyst Henry Miao said.</P>
      <P>"Once local insurance companies are allowed to buy Chinese securities, they will
be able to diversify their portfolios by moving funds currently parked in Europe
and the U.S. where the economy is showing signs of slowing," he said.</P>
      <P>China's stock market has fallen more than 21 percent from a 2010 peak recorded
in January, and Miao said local insurers are expected to take advantage of low
valuations.</P>
      <P>The Financial Supervisory Commission announced Tuesday that it will give the
green light to local insurers to invest in stocks and bonds in China's market
after revising the Regulations Governing Foreign Investments by Insurance
Companies.</P>
      <P>According to the draft revision, insurers must have a risk-based capital ratio
of no less than 250 percent and have already set up a dedicated department to
manage and control investment risk for them to be eligible to invest in China.</P>
      <P>Eligible insurers must also not have any records of violating foreign investment
regulations over the past year, the draft revision said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, China securities investments will be limited to 10 percent of the
FSC-approved foreign investment amount for an eligible insurer, while
investments in Chinese government bonds will not be allowed to exceed 5 percent
of the FSC-approved foreign investment amount.</P>
      <P>"Local life insurers could be the biggest beneficiaries of the new regulations
as they are sitting on a lot of idle funds, " Taiwan International Securities
analyst Brandon Liu said.</P>
      <P>Local media have estimated life insurers will invest as much as NT$445 billion
(US$14 billion) in Chinese securities.</P>
      <P>Liu said Cathay Life Insurance, Shin Kong Life Insurance, Fubon Life Insurance,
China Life Insurance, Nan Shan Life Insurance and Taiwan Life Insurance are
among the possible qualified investors under the new rules.</P>
      <P>The FSC said it welcomes outside opinions on the new rules before it holds a
meeting to finalize them.</P>
      <P>The commission said it expects the new rules will go into effect by the end of
this month.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Wednesday that Premier Wu Den-yih is willing to
answer questions at an extra legislative session to be held to review a recently
signed trade pact with China, and he hoped the deal will be passed in its
entirety.</P>
      <P>The premier is not afraid of any challenge and is willing to attend the
extraordinary legislative session, which is expected to be held in mid-August,
Ma said during a meeting with visiting Japanese scholars at the Presidential
Office.</P>
      <P>The president said the clauses of the economic cooperation framework agreement
(ECFA) could be screened by the Legislature on an item-by-item basis, as the
opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has requested, but urged it to be
passed in its entirety.</P>
      <P>"It is a treaty-like document. You cannot just revise it a bit. And that is in
line with international practices," he said.</P>
      <P>"If there is any different view, it can be expressed in a supplementary
resolution, which could be discussed with China during the next round of
negotiations," the president said.</P>
      <P>The first extra legislative session on the controversial trade agreement held
during the Legislature's summer break took place from July 8-14, but the DPP
boycotted most of it, unhappy that the pact was not being reviewed line by line.</P>
      <P>If no common ground is reached during the second extra session -- expected to be
held after negotiations on the pact have remained deadlocked for over one month
-- lawmakers could call a vote to force the passage of the ECFA.</P>
      <P>As the KMT controls a clear majority in the 113-member body, it would have the
votes to push the ECFA through if such a vote were called.</P>
      <P>The president said that signing the ECFA is an inevitable start but not a
panacea because it cannot solve on its own Taiwan's employment and innovation
challenges.</P>
      <P>"The ECFA is just an appetizer, not a main course, " Ma said, alluding to the
more difficult negotiations on investment protection and dispute resolution
Taiwan and China will face in the future.</P>
      <P>Ma also stressed that signing the ECFA will not affect Taiwan's sovereignty,
and  he pledged  not  to negotiate  cross-Strait reunification issues with China
during his administration.</P>
      <P>Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng said Tuesday that if both caucuses from
the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) and opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
agree, then the Legislature will invite Wu to attend a question-answering
session on the ECFA.</P>
      <P>"It still depends on the DPP's attitude, " Wang said.</P>
      <P>DPP legislative whip Ker Chien-ming contended Wednesday that it would be
unreasonable to invite Wu to attend the second extra session because the premier
was not invited to attend the first one.</P>
      <P>Wang and caucus whips from the KMT and the DPP met last week to discuss the
possibility of holding a second extra session to tackle the trade pact.
According to people at that meeting, the extra session might be convened on Aug.
16, though it was not clear for how long.</P>

      <P>More than half of Taiwan's office workers are interested in getting involved in
the tourism sector, motivated in part by the upcoming Taipei International Flora
Exposition, a 1111 job bank survey has found.</P>
      <P>According to the results of the survey released Tuesday, 56.92 percent of
respondents said they were interested in finding a tourism-related job and
expected an average salary of NT$40,329 per month.</P>
      <P>Among them, 40 percent said their interest in the sector was sparked by the
flower expo, which opens in November. The Taipei City government began
recruiting guides to work at the expo on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>"Chinese tourists and the flora expo have created many openings at hotels and
transportation companies, " said Henry Ho, the public relations director of 1111
Job Bank.</P>
      <P>Among the reasons cited by respondents for their interest in the tourism sector,
"personal interest" ranked first (65.13 percent) , followed by "enjoying eating,
drinking, and having fun" (44.08 percent) and "broadening one's knowledge and
experience" (42.76 percent).</P>
      <P>Regarding their preferred jobs, nearly 35 percent of respondents said they
wanted to be tour guides, with another 27 percent wanting to work for a leisure
and recreation company.</P>
      <P>When asked about the added value of working in the tourism sector, 73 percent of
respondents believed they could expand their knowledge and experience, 59
percent felt they could work and have fun at the same time, and 52 percent said
it could strengthen their international perspective.</P>
      <P>The poll was conducted online between July 20 and Aug. 2 and received 1,131

      <P>Taiwan share prices closed up 0.19 percent Wednesday as rotational buying
remained active in lifting old economy stocks, while select high-tech
heavyweights weakened amid concerns over their earnings outlook, dealers said.</P>
      <P>The weighted index rose 15.13 points to 7,972.66 after moving between 7,938.92
and 7,978.16 on turnover of NT$125.62 billion (US$3.95 billion).</P>
      <P>The market opened little changed from the close of the previous session, up 2.77
points, as investors witnessed an overnight Wall Street fall on disappointing
personal income, spending and factory order figures in the U.S., but interest in
the foodstuff and textile sectors was renewed to offset a slide in the
electronics sector, according to the dealers.</P>
      <P>A total of 1,922 stocks closed up and 1,591 were down, with 307 remaining
unchanged.</P>
      <P>The foodstuff sector posted the highest gains, up 2.1 percent, while textiles
closed up 1.4 percent, plastics and chemical issues were 1.1 percent higher, and
both the cement and the paper and pulp sectors ended the day up 0.8 percent.</P>
      <P>Financial stocks rose 0.6 percent, while construction shares, as well as
machinery and electronics, fell 0.3 percent each.</P>
      <P>"Non-high-tech stocks continued lending support to the broader market on high
liquidity in the market, " Grand Cathay Securities analyst Allen Lin said.</P>
      <P>Lin said investors have embraced high hopes that demand for commodities, in
particular foodstuffs, will strengthen, as some regions in the world, such as
China, have suffered shortages as a result of recent natural disasters.</P>
      <P>"However,  as old economy stocks are relatively  small in capitalization, their
gains were not strong enough to help the broader market get out of the current
narrow trading," Lin said.</P>
      <P>Lin said the high-tech sector remained haunted by worries over slower demand as
the global economy has shown signs of slowing.</P>
      <P>"Recent disappointing U.S. economic data has further raised investors' concerns.
They believe the electronics sector will have a slow third quarter, although
this quarter is supposed to be part of the year's peak season," Lin said.</P>
      <P>Lin said that while the index moved closer to the key 8,000-point mark,
technical resistance ahead of the level was not as strong as the market had
expected based on recent market performance.</P>
      <P>"It is likely that the market will be able to hold itself well above the
7,900-point mark over the next few sessions, " Lin added.</P>
      <P>Among foodstuff stocks, cooking oil firm Fwusow Industry gained 6.74 percent to
close at NT$15.05, and Oceanic Beverages added 6.98 percent to finish at
NT$32.20.</P>
      <P>The tourism sector was boosted by the increasing number of Chinese visitors to
Taiwan, with the Ambassador Hotel closing up 6.92 percent to end the day at
NT$45.55 and Formosa International Hotels up 2.42 percent for a closing price of
NT$507.00.</P>
      <P>However, PC maker Acer fell 1.57 percent to NT$87.60, while flat panel firm AU
Optronics lost 2.58 percent to end trading at NT$30.20.</P>

      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih voiced support Wednesday for a plan of two government
agencies to appeal a Taiwan High Administrative Court ruling that will halt two
expansion projects of the Central Taiwan Science Park (CTSP).</P>
      <P>"If the Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) and the National Science
Council (NSC) decide to appeal the ruling after thorough consideration, the
Executive Yuan will `in principle' support their move," Wu told reporters.</P>
      <P>"It is necessary to respect the court's judgment, but the most important issue
is to keep government policies consistent and coherent and to avoid investors
from losing out," Wu said.</P>
      <P>According to Wu, the Taiwan High Administrative Court's decision to "suspend
operations" at the CTSP's third and fourth expansion projects refers only to
development activities and does not include actual ongoing production.</P>
      <P>The premier said he has ordered the EPA and the NSC to jointly examine the
ruling to ascertain whether it is well-founded from a legal perspective.</P>
      <P>"The government will undoubtedly abide by the final decision if the outcome is
firmly supported by the law," he added.</P>
      <P>The CTSP's third and fourth expansion projects were approved by the previous
administration  of the now-opposition  Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in
2006, and the court's decision that "the work at the two sites be ceased" might
affect combined investment worth over NT$1 trillion (US$30.49 billion).</P>
      <P>Asked whether he feels he is being forced to clean up a mess left behind by the
DPP, Wu said that the opposition party should not be trying to provoke
controversy over an issue that was of its own making.</P>
      <P>"The incumbent government has to assume full responsibility, even though the
issue is something that was decided by its predecessor, " he noted.</P>

      <P>Over the past 15 years,  the hospital has performed lung transplants for 66
terminal lung disease patients. The success rate for the last four years stands
at 93 percent, with the two-year survival rate reaching 80 percent, according to
the NTUH.</P>
      <P>Some of the survivors were invited by the hospital to share their stories at a
news conference held to mark the anniversary.</P>
      <P>Among them was 48-year-old Chen Fou-yang, whose lungs suffered severe damage 14
years ago as a result of poisoning from sweet leaf, a tropical plant believed to
be helpful for losing weight.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, she noticed a decline in her physical strength and began to
experience breathing difficulties after trying the folk remedy for a month.</P>
      <P>Chen said she was later diagnosed with bronchial obstruction and had to receive
a lung transplant. She is by far the longest lung transplant survivor in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Another survivor is 29-year-old Lin Shu-hsuan, who developed lung fibrosis four
years ago after receiving chemotherapy for leukemia for two years.</P>
      <P>Lin received a lung transplant in November 2009.</P>
      <P>Hsu Shao-hsun, a surgeon at the hospital, said the chances are extremely low for
patients to develop lung fibrosis as a result of chemotherapy for leukemia.
Worldwide, there are less than five cases of lung transplants involving such
patients.</P>
      <P>Hsu also noted that lungs suitable for transplants are not easy to find. Of all
organ donors, only 10 percent-12 percent provide viable lungs, he added.</P>

      <P>A Taiwanese medical mission is currently on a visit to the Caribbean ally of
Saint Lucia, where it is offering free clinics at St. Jude Hospital, the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The six-member mission, including four doctors and two nurses from central
Taiwan's Changhua Christian  Hospital,  are on a three-week medical aid mission
at the hospital, with which the Changhua facility is twinned.</P>
      <P>Thanks to Taiwan's medical assistance, outpatient services for otolaryngologic
treatment were opened for the first time, under the direction of Chang Cheng-
chuan, the head of the mission and the vice superintendent of Changhua Christian
Hospital.</P>
      <P>Chang said the total of 60 outpatient visits in the first four days of the
mission represented the fastest growth in the St. Jude Hospital, showing the
great need for otolarygologic services there.</P>
      <P>In addition,  the mission donated medical  facilities  and equipment, including
dental tools and suction gear, as well as 500 sets of toothbrush  and toothpaste
to the hospital's  dental department.</P>
      <P>Percival McDonald, chairman of the Board of Directors of St. Jude Hospital,

      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) is making a last-ditch, all-
out effort to dissuade Kaohsiung Magistrate Yang Chiu-hsing from running in the
year-end mayoral election for the soon- to-be formed Kaohsiung municipality, DPP
Chairwoman Tsai Ing- wen said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Tsai, who was expected to meet Yang the following day, said the DPP will not
rule out any possibilities, including inviting former DPP Chairman Lin Yi-hsiung
and other party heavyweights, to join the ranks in persuading Yang to give up
his attempt.</P>
      <P>Yang, a two-term Kaohsiung magistrate who enjoys high popularity in the southern
county, shocked his party comrades a day earlier by saying that after "a long
internal conflict, " he had arrived at the decision to run in the election, and
was "just a step away from officially announcing his bid."</P>
      <P>Yang lost to incumbent Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu in the DPP primary, which has
been described by Yang and his supporters as "unfair."</P>
      <P>DPP Secretary-General Wu Nai-jen said Yang's running would not cause a split of
the DPP vote and impact the party's election prospects, although he added that
it would be "lamentable" for Yang to do so in defiance of the party's decision.</P>
      <P>But DPP legislative caucus head Ke Chien-ming had a very different view, saying
that if Yang were to run, it would be greatly detrimental to the DPP in the
election and that the party "could only prepare for the worst. "</P>
      <P>Yang for his part said he would not back down and called on everyone to respect
his choice.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung city and county, to be integrated to the Kaohsiung municipality at the
end of the year, has long been a stronghold of the DPP, which considers a
victory in the coming election a virtual certainty with Chen as its candidate.</P>

      <P>United Microelectronics Corp. (UMC) , the world's second largest contract chip
maker, announced Wednesday that its second quarter net earnings were the highest
for any quarter in nearly five and half years.</P>
      <P>UMC posted NT$5.27 billion (US$166 million) in net income from April to June, up
51.4 percent from the first quarter, with earnings per share at NT$0.42.</P>
      <P>Sales in the second quarter totaled NT$29.75 billion, up 11.3 percent from a
quarter earlier, beating expectations.</P>
      <P>At an investor conference call, UMC said its gross margin for the second quarter
rose 5 percentage points from the first quarter to 29.6 percent, while its
operating profit gained 59.7 percent to NT$5.44 billion.</P>
      <P>It was the most profitable quarter for UMC since it posted net income of NT$8.74
billion in the third quarter of 2004.</P>
      <P>To meet robust demand, UMC has decided to raise its capital expenditure in 2010
to US$1.8 billion from the previously planned US$1.2 billion to US$1.5 billion.</P>
      <P>UMC CEO Sun Shih-wei said the company's production capacity was fully utilized
in the second quarter with wafer shipments growing to a record 1.16 million
8-inch equivalent wafers.</P>
      <P>Sun said he expects UMC's capacity to remain fully utilized in the third
quarter, with shipments expected to rise 1-5 percent from the second quarter and
the average sales price likely to grow 4-6 percent.</P>
      <P>Gross margin for the third quarter is expected to rise to 31-33 percent, the CEO
added.</P>
      <P>"To continue boosting competitiveness  and pursuing  steady growth...UMC plans
to raise this year's capital expenditure to US$1.8 billion to satisfy customers'
demand for advanced technology and capacity," Sun said.</P>
      <P>UMC will use 87 percent of the capital expenditure to boost its 12-inch wafer
production capacity and the remaining 13 percent will be spent to raise 8-inch
wafer production capacity, he said.</P>
      <P>In the second quarter, chips used in consumer electronics products accounted for
31 percent of the company's total sales, up from 26 percent  in the first
quarter,  while chips used in communications products made up 54 percent of the
total, down from 59 percent.</P>
      <P>In the April-June period, advanced production processes of 65-nanometers or
better accounted for 24 percent of the company's total sales, up from 18
percent, and Sun said the figure is expected to exceed 30 percent in the fourth
quarter.</P>
      <P>According to a survey conducted by IC Insights, UMC was the world's 18th largest
IC firm at the end of June, an improvement over its 24th-place ranking last
year, while rival Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. edged up one notch to
fifth in the global IC firm rankings.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Fubon Group has expanded from its core financial business to telecom, TV and
online shopping, and cosmetics and drug stores, all of which have helped extend
the group's reach to consumers.</P>
      <P>"People only see Fubon investing in various industries, but they fail to see
that what the group invests in is basically various ways of distribution, " said
Daniel M. Tsai, CEO of Fubon Financial Holding.</P>
      <P>The group also chooses industries with strong cash flow.</P>
      <P>Tsai said these businesses have helped Fubon strengthen its ability to find the
right products and services and offer them to customers at a good price.</P>
      <P>As the group faces tough competition with 30 plus banks and more than 100
security companies, Fubon invests in industries that have fewer competitors and
clear targets to utilize the ability built up from its financial business, Tsai
said.</P>
      <P>Tsai used the group's momo shopping brand as an example, saying there were only
two competitors in TV shopping in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>After understanding the industry and what merchandise sells, the brand ventured
into online business so that the same products can be sold on two platforms, he
said.</P>
      <P>"Even though the online business of the 'momo' brand still lags behind the
shopping business of Yahoo! Taiwan and PChome, it has surpassed the PayEasy
website and ranks third or fourth in Taiwan in terms of sales," Tsai said.</P>
      <P>He also pointed out that momo's management already has related experience as
Fubon was the first of Taiwan's financial holding companies to set up its own
telemarketing company.</P>
      <P>With core ability built up throughout the years, Fubon has seized opportunities
to expand its portfolio in the past decade. Tsai is now eyeing the digital
business of cable TV operators and says the bank's experience will continue to
give it an edge in the new venture.</P>

      <P>Taiwanese negotiators will uphold the principle of parity in talks with China to
resolve a dispute over an increase in direct flights across the Taiwan Strait, a
civil aviation official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>"We look forward to seeking common interests despite differences in the upcoming
talks and will insist on parity in distribution of the  flight  quota  and
schedule,  "  said  Yin  Cheng-peng, director-general of the Civil Aeronautics
Administration.</P>
      <P>Civil aviation officials from Taiwan and China are scheduled to meet in the
southeastern Chinese coastal city of Xiamen Thursday to try to settle the
dispute.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese and Chinese officials originally agreed in May to allow carriers from
each side to fly 50 additional nonstop cross-strait flights per week starting in
June to meet growing market demand.</P>
      <P>As part of the deal, carriers from each country have operated 14 new weekly
flights between Taipei's Songshan Airport and Shanghai's Hongqiao Airport since
mid-June.</P>
      <P>But China rejected most of the other new flights Taiwanese carriers applied to
operate under the deal because they did not meet Beijing's requirement that 20
of the 50 new flights serve Xiamen or Fuzhou, both adjacent to the Haixi special
economic zone, one of China's priority development targets.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese officials, however, have said the May agreement did not require local
carriers to fly any additional flights to the two Chinese cities since they were
already operating a total of 22 weekly flights to those destinations as part of
their original quota of 135 flights per week.</P>
      <P>After China rejected the Taiwanese carriers' applications, Taiwan retaliated by
ordering Chinese carriers to suspend 31 of their newly approved cross-strait
flights from Aug. 1, and the remaining five flights from Oct. 30.</P>
      <P>With the dispute disrupting the plans of Taiwanese and Chinese carriers, China
agreed to reopen talks on the issue.</P>
      <P>An earlier report from Beijing said the Chinese delegation to the Xiamen round
of talks will be headed by a department chief of the General Administration of
Civil Aviation of China.</P>

it.</P>
      <P>Starting from Jan. 1, 2011, Taiwanese items on the agreement's "early harvest

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Control Yuan censured the Department of Health (DOH) Wednesday over its
failure to stop the circulation of Chinese herbal medicine that contains
standard drugs -- a combination that is strictly banned in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The DOH was seen as "having ignored" the problem for many years, which has led
to wider circulation of the banned medicines, said Cheng Jen-hung, a member of
the Control Yuan which is the watchdog arm of the government.</P>
      <P>Chen said the combination of herbal and chemical ingredients in medicine could
be toxic.</P>
      <P>"Herb-drug medicines are very harmful to human health, " Cheng said.</P>
      <P>However, it has been observed that the number of cases involving the marketing
of these banned medicines has not dropped over the past five years, he added.</P>
      <P>Cheng said the DOH's National Laboratories of Foods and Drugs found that in
2005, 11.2 percent of medicines sent to the agency for safety checks were herb-
drug products.</P>
      <P>In 2006, the figure jumped to 20.4 percent, but dropped to 13.7 percent in 2007,
then 8.8 percent in 2008, he said, citing DOH statistics.</P>
      <P>However, in 2009, it climbed again to 23.8 percent, he said.</P>
      <P>In the period from April 1 to June 30 this year, health inspectors and police
carried out safety checks on 122 random samples of Chinese medicines from local
markets, clinics and pharmacies and found that 54 percent of them were herb-drug
combinations, Cheng said.</P>
      <P>Under Taiwan law, the maximum penalty for selling Chinese medicines mixed with
standard drugs is a prison term of 10 years and a fine of NT$5 million to NT$10
million (US$314,000).</P>

      <P>Personal computer giant Acer Inc. said Wednesday it posted NT$6.89 billion
(US$217 million) in net profit for the first half of this year, up 57.76 percent
from a year earlier on a recovery in global demand after the financial meltdown.</P>
      <P>The company also reported earnings per share (EPS) of NT$2.6.</P>
      <P>In the second quarter alone, Acer recorded NT$3.59 billion in net profit, up
53.54 percent from a year earlier with EPS at NT$1.35.</P>
      <P>"The earnings performance for the first half has been widely expected, and came
as no surprise to the market, " said MasterLink Securities analyst Tom Tang.</P>
      <P>Tang said Acer weathered the impact from debt problems in the eurozone in the
second quarter by applying successful marketing strategies to stabilize sales
there, while its rivals saw shipments decline during the same period.</P>
      <P>In addition, the company disposed of shares of electronics component vendor
Yosun Industrial Corp. to generate about NT$200 million in profit to boost its
bottom line in the first half, Tang said.</P>
      <P>"However, as the global economy has shown signs of weakening in the second half
of this year, PC firms, including Acer, could see slower sales growth," Tang
went on.</P>
      <P>"So, Acer share prices have been consolidated for some time. I expect NT$95
could be the highest they will reach over the next few months," Tang said.</P>
      <P>Acer closed down 1.57 percent at NT$87.60 Wednesday, while the weighted index

      <P>The country manager of Intel Taiwan dismissed speculation Wednesday that the
world's largest chipmaker is withdrawing its support for the development of
WiMAX broadband wireless technology in Taiwan following a recent office closure.</P>
      <P>"We will continue to work with Taiwanese companies in the field," Jason Chen
told reporters at a conference in Taipei in which the world's first netbook
computer embedded with Intel's WiMAX module was unveiled.</P>
      <P>In his first public remarks on the speculation, Chen explained the closure in
late June of Intel's WiMAX Program Office (WPO), which was set up to promote the
technology, was "simply a small internal restructuring plan."</P>
      <P>The plan does not signal any change in Intel's commitment to WiMAX, he said.</P>
      <P>"We didn't expect that this change would spark such a big controversy in
Taiwan," he added.</P>
      <P>On a recent announcement by the Taipei Computer Association (TCA) that Intel
President and Chief Executive Officer Paul Otellini will visit Taiwan in October
to reiterate the company's WiMAX commitment, the executive said that the visit
has not yet been finalized.</P>
      <P>Navin Shenoy, vice president and general manager of Intel's Asia-Pacific
operations, met with TCA Chairman J.T. Wang July 7 to clarify Intel's commitment
after the trade group expressed serious concerns over the office closure,
according to the TCA.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that Intel sends a senior executive to Taiwan every three or four
months, which shows the closeness of the interaction between the company and its
partners in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He added that Taiwan is a major partner with Intel in many fields, including
notebook computers, desktop computers and cloud computing, and that "WiMAX is
just a very small part of the bilateral cooperation."</P>
      <P>Intel has promised to invest US$500 million over five years in the sector under
a deal with the Ministry of Economic Affairs signed in 2008.</P>
      <P>In a statement released at the press briefing, Intel-invested VMAX Telecom, one
of the six Taiwanese WiMAX licensees, said the launch of the new netbook
computer that day is the result of cooperation between VMAX Telecom, Intel and
Taiwan's Asustek Computer Inc.</P>
      <P>"This cooperation shows that Intel is using this action to demonstrate its
ongoing full support of Taiwan's WiMAX industry," the statement reads.</P>

      <P>Taiwan won two bronze medals in the last iGeO competition in 2008, which is

      <P>Singapore was the biggest winner this year, with all four contestants taking
home medals -- two golds and two silvers -- in the country's first appearance in
the contest, an organizer said.</P>
      <P>According to the Taipei-based Geographical Society of China and the Department
of Geography at National Taiwan Normal University, a total of 28 groups
comprising 106 participants from around the world -- the most participants ever
-- took part in the competition.</P>
      <P>A total of 53 medals were presented during the contest this year, including nine
golds, 17 silvers and 27 bronze medals.</P>
      <P>The nine gold medal winners included two students from Romania, two from
Singapore, and one each from Finland, Australia, Russia, Poland and Lithuania.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Education said previously that because the competition  is not
globally recognized like the International Mathematical Olympiad, local winners
would not be awarded by the ministry or recommended for admission to select
universities.</P>
      <P>The international  competition included a written test,  a multimedia test and a

and other furniture will encourage visitors to enter the pavilion and relax, he
said.</P>
      <P>According to Tseng,  the exhibition  will include designer furniture, videos and
multi-media installations.</P>
      <P>"There are four video screens in the Taiwan pavilion, one of which will show the
views of Taiwan from a train traveling from the central city of Taichung to
other parts of the island, he said.</P>
      <P>Visitors will be able to view images of different cities in Taiwan, and if they
need more information, they can access a computer in the pavilion, Tseng said.</P>
      <P>"We won't be trying to explain what Taiwan is like -- visitors to the pavilion
can explore for themselves," he said.</P>
      <P>It is the fifth time that Taiwanese architects are participating in the event.</P>
      <P>The team was chosen last year from among 10 groups by a National Taiwan Museum
of Fine Arts committee, according to Minister of the Council for Cultural
Affairs Emile Sheng.</P>

      <P>Retail beverage chains will be required to offer discounts to clients who bring
reusable containers from Jan. 1 next year, or to offer refunds of NT$1 to
consumers who return two used disposable cups, an official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>"The new regulation is part of our efforts to reduce the consumption  of single-
use  beverage  cups  over pollution  or environmental concerns, "said Wang Chun-
yuan, director-general of the Solid Waste Management Bureau under the
Environmental Protection Administration (EPA).</P>
      <P>"Coffee, beverage, convenience and fast food chain stores must submit disposable
drinking cup reduction plans to the EPA before the end of this year detailing
their discount or incentive programs for consumers who bring reusable
containers, " Wang said.</P>
      <P>If beverage chain store operators fail to come up with incentive programs, he
added, they will be required to offer NT$1 to every customer who returns two
used disposable cups.</P>
      <P>"The new requirement  has become  necessary  because  huge consumption of
disposable cups has not only squeezed our natural resources but also polluted
our rivers and living environment, " Wang said.</P>
      <P>According to an EPA estimate, chain stores in Taiwan consume about 1.5 billion
single-use cups a year, Wang said, adding that littered disposable cups often
clog local rivers and ditches.</P>
      <P>In April this year, Wang said, his office invited major chain store operators to
discuss measures to trim consumption of disposable cups.</P>
      <P>"About 40 brands, with a total of 11,000 chain stores around the country, have
agreed to support the mandatory discount or recycling program, " Wang said,
adding that the number accounts for 70 percent of local beverage, coffee,
convenience and fast food chain stores.</P>
      <P>The discounts or incentives can be offered in various forms, such as a deduction
of NT$2 for each 700 cubic centimeter cup of coffee or soft drink and a NT$1
discount for a cup smaller than 700 cc, Wang said.</P>
      <P>Operators may also offer cash incentives for consumers who have collected a
certain amount of credits or offer increased quantity for those who bring
reusable containers.</P>
      <P>After the new regulation takes effect, those who fail to comply will be slapped
with fines ranging between NT$60,000 and NT$300,000 under Article 22 of the
Waste Management Act, Wang said.</P>
      <P>Some coffee and convenience store chains already offer discounts for consumers
who bring reusable containers.</P>
      <P>President Starbucks Coffee Corp. started to promote reusable cups 12 years ago,
offering a NT$10 discount for each cup. An Ikari Coffee manager said the company
presently offers a NT$5 discount for each cup.</P>
      <P>A spokeswoman for the 7-Eleven convenience store chain said the company started
in May 2009 to offer a NT$3 discount for each cup of coffee for consumers with
reusable containers. As of April this year, more than 2 million customers had
taken advantage of the policy, she added.</P>
      <P>FamilyMart chain store operators said they are also offering a NT$3 discount for
each cup of Mr. Brown coffee for customers who bring reusable cups.</P>

      <P>Mothers in metropolitan areas are more inclined  to spend their one month of
traditional  postpartum confinement in either a nursing home or a care center, a
health professional said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>According to S. W. Deng, director-general of the Bureau of Nursing and Health
Service Development, 20 percent to 30 percent of first time mothers in Taipei
usually choose to stay at postpartum centers for 10 to 14 days after giving
birth.</P>
      <P>The cost of staying at such centers ranges from NT$2,000 to NT$5,000 (US$67 to
US$167) per day, meals excluded.</P>
      <P>A postpartum nursing home is a registered medical institution with trained
professional staff who help mothers deal problems such as breast inflammation
and teach them how to care for a newborn.</P>
      <P>However, mothers need to be aware that a postpartum care center is not a medical
institution and it could be fined for performing medical procedures, said M. C.
Chen, a section chief at the bureau.</P>
      <P>Local health bureaus have been encouraging the conversion of postpartum care
centers into nursing homes. But because nursing homes are required to conform to
the same regulations as a hospital with regard to the number of beds and nurse-
to-patient ratio, most postpartum care centers prefer to stick to their
designation and pay the fines with which they are often hit.</P>

      <P>Large Japanese enterprises including Sony, Rakuten and TDK have promised to
expand investment in Taiwan, Minister without Portfolio Yiin Chii-ming said
Wednesday after returning from a recent trip to Japan.</P>
      <P>Yiin told the Executive Yuan that he visited 11 Japanese enterprises during his
trip to drum up investment between July 25 and Aug. 1.</P>
      <P>He signed four memorandums of understanding (MOUs) and two letters of intent
(LOIs) on joint projects after explaining to Japanese companies the benefits of
Taiwan's economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) with China, which was
signed in late June.</P>
      <P>Yiin's Japan trip was the first of a number of trips the government has planned
to draw investment after signing the trade pact.</P>
      <P>Yiin said the first MOU was with FiS Inc. -- a gas sensor manufacturer with
advanced semiconductor gas sensor technology -- on cooperation  with Taiwanese
businesses  to jointly develop new products.</P>
      <P>He signed an MOU and an LOI with Sony in which the giant media conglomerate
agreed to boost cooperation with Taiwanese factories in the development of
information communication products exclusively for consumers in emerging
markets.</P>
      <P>Sony Music Entertainment Inc. of the Sony Group is scheduled to send
representatives to Taiwan before the end of this year to help increase its media
content investment here, Yiin said.</P>
      <P>The other two MOUs were inked with the Electronic Book Publishers Association of
Japan, with Taiwan agreeing to help 37 members of the organization conduct
software and hardware cooperation with Taiwanese companies, according to Yiin.</P>
      <P>An LOI with the Rakuten business group described plans to increase investment in
Taiwan's services sector, the minister said. Rakuten is the biggest online
shopping mall operator in Japan.</P>
      <P>In addition, TDK, a leading recordable media brand worldwide, told him it will
open an international research and development center in Taiwan and increase its
technological cooperation with Taiwan manufacturers to produce environment-
friendly electronic parts and components, Yiin said.</P>
      <P>In the report, the former minister of economic affairs discussed the
government's plan to build a "global innovation corridor" on the island. He said
efforts will be made to develop new products -- with Japan's technological
cooperation -- in the five major industrial sectors of green energy, materials,
digital content, precision machinery and biotechnology.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan is capable of entering another "golden decade" if it can use its
competitive edge well and take full advantage of the Chinese market on the basis
of a recent landmark trade pact with China, the Topology Research Institute
(TRI) said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>According to TRI vice president Simon Yang, Taiwan has great innovation
potential and is strong in areas such as the manufacture of smart phones and
electronic readers, while China is a leader in solar energy, electronic vehicles
and smart grids.</P>
      <P>If Taiwan and China can work together in a fair and mutually beneficial business
mode, they could set the rules and dominate the global market, Yang said.</P>
      <P>However, the two sides need to devise a new business model that focuses on
consumption in China, now that the days of cheap labor in China are over for
Taiwan manufacturers who export to western countries, Yang added.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, the Haixi Economic Zone in China's Fujia Province is the
best option for Taiwan hi-tech companies dedicated to cross-Taiwan Strait trade,
as Taiwan and Fujian share a common language and culture, Yang said.</P>
      <P>In addition, he said, labor and production costs in Fujian are lower compared to
other regions like the Yangzijiang River Delta, the Pearl River Delta or the
Around Bohai Gulf Area.</P>
      <P>In view of an unprecedented favorable environment across the strait, Taiwan
should use its hi-tech niche, creative ideas, brand building capability and
customized service to create maximum value for its products, he suggested.</P>

      <P>A special music festival will be held later this year on a floating stage that
will follow an A-shaped waterway in the Zhaishan Tunnel on the outlying island
of Kinmen, the organizers announced Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The 101-meter-long Zhaishan Tunnel, a war relic that is now a tourist
attraction, boasts a 357-meter-A-shaped waterway where five noted Taiwanese
musicians  staged a concert  last October to commemorate the 60th anniversary of
the Battle of Kuningtou.</P>
      <P>"As the unprecedented waterway concert drew an enthusiastic response, we decide
to hold a music festival at the same venue this year, " said Tseng Wei-hung,
director of the Kinmen National Park Administration.</P>
      <P>The festival, scheduled for Oct. 16-17, will present a total of six concerts
that will feature the performance of romantic classics by famous Taiwan
musicians such as cellist Chang Cheng-chieh, flutist Wu Chung-hsien, harpist
Hung Chi-mei and violinist Liang Chien-wen, Tseng said at a news conference.</P>
      <P>Chang, who took the initiative to stage a concert in the Zhaishan Tunnel last
year, has been named artistic director of this year's music festival, Tseng
said.</P>
      <P>The  cellist  performed  Offenbach's  "Barcarolle"  on  his centuries-old
Ruggieri cello in the waterway Wednesday in a preview of the festival,
enthralling tourists who were visiting the war relic built in 1961.</P>
      <P>Chang said he was amazed by the acoustics at the venue during last year's
concert, describing them as "much, much better" than he had expected.</P>
      <P>"I have only one word to describe my first-ever concert in the waterway --
terrific," he said emotionally.</P>
      <P>Online registration for this year's Zhaishan festival will begin Sept. 1. Each
concert will last 40 minutes, with an audience of 300 packed onto the walkway
surrounding the waterway.</P>
      <P>Located  in the southwestern  part of Kinmen Island,  the underground Zhaishan
Tunnel -- 101 meters long, 6 meters wide and 3.5 meters high -- opens into the
Taiwan Strait. Its A-shaped waterway has a pier that can dock up to 42 small
boats.</P>
      <P>With the improvement of cross-strait relations, the number of Taiwanese troops
stationed in Kinmen has been reduced and the island is being gradually
transformed into a tourist destination, with war sites as the main attraction.</P>

      <P>Taiwanese tennis payer Lu Yen-hsun said Wednesday that his loss in the first
round match of the Legg Mason Tennis Classic was not a bad thing as it could
allow him more practice time closer to the U.S. Open.</P>
      <P>Lu, ranked world No. 44 before the classic event, lost in straight sets (7-5,
6-1) to Alejandro Falla (world No. 65) of Colombia in the first round of the
men's singles a day earlier.</P>
      <P>Lu missed a chance to break Falla's service game in the hotly contested first
set.</P>
      <P>Lu said that he was relatively satisfied with his performance in the first 10
games, but only managed to hold one of his own services games in the second set,
due mostly to an old foot injury and a lack of concentration.</P>
      <P>Lu is scheduled to proceed to Canada Thursday to compete in the Toronto Open,
after which he will participate in the Cincinnati Open before the U.S. Open, the
last stop of the grand slam events in New York at the end of August.</P>
      <P>Lu's ranking may slide due to the latest setback, requiring him to play from the
qualification round in the Toronto Open.</P>
      <P>"It might not be bad for me as I would have to play several more matches in the
Toronto event, giving me more opportunities to practice and get back to
competition level as soon as possible, " an optimistic Lu said.</P>
      <P>"I hope my German coach will help me return to my best form after I meet him
next week. There are more than two weeks until the U.S. Open, " said the 26-year

      <P>One year after Typhoon Morakot wreaked havoc in Taiwan, the volume of silt
dredged by the Water Resources Agency is estimated at 42 times the height of the
Taipei 101 tower, Economic Affairs Minister Yen-Shiang Shih said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, the demand for sandstone averages 6 million metric meters per year,
Shih said, adding that Typhoon Morakot had washed away 120 million metric meters
of sandstone -- approximately 20 years supply.</P>
      <P>As of Aug. 1, the build-up of silt from the typhoon had been significantly
reduced and irrigation streams had been expanded to four times their usual size,
as a result of the dredging operations, Shih reported.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Small and Medium Enterprise Administration is working with the
Morakot post-disaster teconstruction task force to provide loans to local

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan government is working hard to complete a massive reconstruction plan
as the anniversary of the most deadly typhoon to impact Taiwan in half a century
approaches.</P>
      <P>Typhoon Morakot hit Taiwan Aug. 8, 2009, leaving 677 dead, 22 missing and
causing more than NT$100 billion in damages. The storm produced 2,777
millimeters of rainfall and mudslides that wiped out Siaolin in the southern
county of Kaohsiung, killing around 500 in the village alone.</P>
      <P>A Morakot  Post-Disaster  Reconstruction  Council  was soon established to
handle a wide range of reconstruction works, including resettlement of typhoon
victims, a victim employment plan, the repair of breached dikes and dredging of
rivers, the distribution of relief funds  and the revitalizing  local
industries,  especially  in agriculture and fisheries. A budget of NT$151.9
billion was allocated for relief and post-disaster reconstruction.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou, who was criticized for mishandling the post-disaster
relief and subsequently suffered in approval ratings, pledged to relocate all
the victims by the anniversary and reiterated the point in his weekly video
address on July 31 -- but that goal will not be completed in time.</P>
      <P>According to Premier Wu Den-yih, as of Aug. 2 only 1,480 of 2,586 affected
households have moved into newly constructed permanent homes. Wu cited weather
conditions in the worst-hit eastern and southern Taiwan regions for the
shortfall.</P>
      <P>The reconstruction work may not live up to people's high expectations, but Wu
said on Aug. 1 that the government had done its best. Some lessons the
government learned in the aftermath of the deadly typhoon were probably as
important as the reconstruction work itself, the premier said, such as making
disaster relief a core task for Taiwan's military forces and the integration of
government agencies involved in relief efforts.</P>
      <P>Wu also praised efforts by Taiwan's civic organizations in the past year.</P>
      <P>All 63 repair projects in the most dangerous areas have been completed, Yang
Wei-fuu, director-general of the Water Resources Agency (WRA) under the Ministry
of Economic Affairs (MOEA), said in a press conference Wednesday. Although less
than 70 percent of all repair projects have been finished, they will be done by
the next high-water season in 2011, Yang added.</P>
      <P>Dredging of rivers is among the most difficult tasks, Yang said, noting that 1.2
billion cubic tons of gravel had filled river beds and reservoirs after the
typhoon. The project is ongoing, but it will take years to finish the dredging,
he said.</P>
      <P>The WRA had dredged 87.2 million cubic tons of gravel -- approximately the same
volume as 42 Taipei 101 buildings -- as of Aug. 1, he said. However, Dredging of
the Taimali River in the eastern county of Taitung is way behind schedule, he
added.</P>
      <P>The MOEA also offered financial  relief and mortgages  to businesses in several
towns in the worst-hit areas as well as providing assistance to businesses in
the sectors of farming, fisheries, livestock and forestry.</P>
      <P>The Council of Labor Affairs has said it has provided 13,940 employment
opportunities for typhoon victims under its "August 8 Temporary Work Plan." By

      <P>Taiwan has successfully developed a technique to use silkworm pupas to produce
caterpillar fungus, which is a valuable Chinese medicine, researchers said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The breakthrough was achieved by planting parasitic fungus in four-week-old
silkworm pupas, said the researchers at the Miaoli District Agricultural
Research and Extension Station under the Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture.</P>
      <P>It takes 60 days to 75 days for the fungus to grow from the body of the pupas
and envelop them, according to the station.</P>
      <P>Dried caterpillar fungus -- called Dong Chong Xia Cao in Chinese -- can be used
as medicine or as an ingredient in health foods, the station said, touting the
fungus as an anti-aging and immunity boosting product.</P>
      <P>The price of Dong Chong Xia Cao has been rising steadily because of a supply
shortage due to overharvesting, the station said, adding that in China it costs
200,000 yuan (NT$1 million) per kilogram.</P>
      <P>The high price promoted researchers in Taiwan and China to work on developing
techniques for producing the fungus artificially, the station said.</P>

      <P>The Taipei Representative Office in Singapore and the Singapore Trade Office in
Taipei issued a joint press release Thursday morning stating that "the Separate
Customs Territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu (Chinese Taipei) and
Singapore, both members of the World Trade Organization (WTO), have agreed to
explore the feasibility  of an economic cooperation agreement between them."</P>
      <P>The initiative shown in exploring the feasibility of an economic cooperation
agreement signifies Taiwan's efforts in participating in regional economic
integration,  Vanessa Yea-ping Shih, Taiwan's representative to Singapore, said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Shih told Central News Agency that the government has made trade agreement
negotiations one of the most important tasks to prevent Taiwan from being
marginalized in the process of regional economic integration.</P>
      <P>Singapore, as Taiwan's fifth-largest export market and one of its top 10 trading
partners, is on top of Taiwan's wish list of countries with which to sign trade
cooperation agreements, she added.</P>
      <P>The Southeast Asian country has signed 15 free trade agreements with its trading
partners, among which 13 have taken effect. Six agreements are still under
negotiation.</P>
      <P>Suggesting that the conclusion of the cross-Taiwan  Strait economic cooperation
framework agreement (ECFA)  has benefited Taiwan's pursuit of free trade
agreements, Shih said that initiating any trade negotiations requires the
willingness to do so as well as a propitious environment.</P>
      <P>She added that in the process of negotiation, the two parties will take contents
of Singapore's  existing  trade cooperation agreements for reference, and in the
process of negotiation, the government will hold fast to the principle of mutual
benefits.</P>
      <P>As to the title of the agreement, Shih said that Singapore has been very
flexible in naming the 15 trade agreements it has signed. While some are called
free trade agreements (FTA) , the agreement it signed with New Zealand is the
Closer Economic Partnership (CEP) Agreement,  with India the Comprehensive
Economic  Cooperation Agreement (CECA) , and with Japan the Economic Partnership
Agreement (EPA).</P>
      <P>Shih said the two parties will study the feasibility of a trade pact under the
WTO framework. Since agricultural exports will not be an issue, Shih suggested
that the negotiation process will be more simple due to less impact on the
agricultural sector.</P>
      <P>The negotiations will start later this year, according to the joint press
release. (by Garfie Li, Tang Pei-chun and Lillian Lin)</P>

sink further into a "cold-blooded island"?</P>
      <P>The recent string of controversies surrounding various industrial development
projects are like land mines exploding one after another. A hand grenade was
thrown into the minefield when the Taiwan High Administrative Court on Aug. 2
ordered the suspension of the Central Taiwan Science Park's expansion project in
Houli, Taichung County, following the annulment of its environmental impact
assessment on the grounds that it failed to consider the effects of the project
on the health of local residents.</P>

      <P>A recent report by the National Audit Office shows that Taiwan's outstanding
national debt totaled more than NT$4.2 trillion as of the end of 2009, an amount
that could take at least 62 years to pay back. In 2010 and 2011, it is estimated

    <HEADLINE>Talk of the day--ECFA effect:Taiwan begins FTA talks with Singapore</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>08/05/10  11:05:16
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Slightly more than a month after Taiwan signed a landmark economic cooperation
framework agreement (ECFA) with China, Singapore has formally expressed its
intention to follow suit in negotiating a similar deal with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The two countries simultaneously announced their plan early Thursday to begin
exploration of the feasibility of signing an economic cooperation agreement
similar to a free trade agreement (FTA) under the framework of the World Trade
Organization (WTO).</P>
      <P>Diplomatic officials said signing such an accord will benefit both countries
because their economies are more complementary to than competitive against each
other.</P>
      <P>More importantly, the officials said, Singapore can serve as a stepping stone
for Taiwan to strike similar free trade pacts with other major trade partners,
including Japan and other Southeast Asian countries.</P>
      <P>A free trade agreement with Singapore will also mark a giant step forward in
Taiwan's quest for participation in regional economic integration, the officials
added.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from the local media coverage of the new development:</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>Singapore's consent to start FTA talks with Taiwan in the wake of Taiwan's
signing of the ECFA with China is widely seen as an ice-breaking achievement of
President Ma Ying-jeou's modus vivendi approach to break out of the country's
diplomatic isolation caused by China's sovereignty claim over Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Although the agreement to be signed between Taiwan and Singapore may not be
called an FTA to avoid offending China -- which insists such a pact can only be
struck between two sovereign states, diplomatic officials said -- the accord
will offer Taiwanese business people easier access to South Asian and Southeast
Asian markets. Singapore has signed an encompassing economic cooperation pact
with India and has been a key member of the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN).</P>
      <P>The proposed Taiwan-Singapore economic agreement will also help attract more
foreign conglomerates to invest in Taiwan, the officials added.</P>
      <P>As Singapore now only levies heavy tariffs on cigarettes, alcohol and other
luxury goods, Vice Minister of Economic Affairs Lin Sheng-chung said Taiwan's
manufacturing sector may not benefit much from the planned FTA with the
Southeast Asian city-state.</P>
      <P>Lin said local financial service providers and the transportation sector will
benefit most by securing better market access terms under an FTA with Singapore.</P>
      <P>Singapore may ask Taiwan to exempt tariffs on its petrochemical, machinery and
electronics products, Lin said, adding that as Taiwan's duty rate on
petrochemicals is only 2 percent, tariff cuts will not have a great impact on
local producers.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, Taiwan is also seeking the possibility of signing FTAs or
similar pacts with other ASEAN countries, including Malaysia, Thailand and the
Philippines. (Aug. 5, 2010).</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>Christina Liu, chairwoman of the Council for Economic Planning and Development,
said Singapore is the most active Asian country in seeking FTAs with its major
trade partners.</P>
      <P>"The city-state has long intended to sign such a pact with Taiwan, but such
efforts were dampened by the special situation in the Taiwan Strait in the
past," Liu said.</P>
      <P>"After China signed the economic cooperation framework agreement with Taiwan,
Singapore is willing to follow suit, " the government's top economic planner
said, adding she believes Singapore's move will inspire even more countries to
negotiate similar deals with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>While a Taiwan-Singapore free trade pact will contribute to Taiwan's  overall
development,  Liu acknowledged  that certain industrial  sectors may still be
adversely  impacted and need government assistance to tide them over such
challenges.</P>
      <P>Kuo Cheng-liang,  spokesman  for the opposition  Democratic Progressive Party's
ECFA response task force, said he sees nothing worthy of media hype for
negotiating a trade pact with Singapore because the city-state is not a key
export outlet for Taiwan. (Aug. 5, 2010).</P>
      <P>Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>DPP spokesman Tsai Chi-chang said Taiwan and Singapore were already nearing the
satge of signing an FTA back in 2004 when the DPP was in power.</P>
      <P>"The deal was later dropped mainly because of China's obstruction," Tsai
contended, adding that the Ma administration should explain whether the new
round of Taiwan-Singapore FTA negotations would be conducted under the premise
of Beijing's consent.</P>
      <P>"If the talks would be held with the Ma adminsitration agreeing to Beijing's
'one China' principle, Taiwan's sovereign status would be compromised," Tsai
claimed. (Aug. 5, 2010).</P>

      <P>The Consumers' Foundation said Thursday that 21 percent of the toys it recently
inspected failed to pass safety tests, with 7 percent containing excessive
levels of plasticizer that could affect children's endocrine systems and cause
cancer.</P>
      <P>According to the foundation, six out of the 28 toy samples it collected from toy
stores, hypermarkets and shopping websites in May failed to pass chemical and
physical tests. Businesses selling the items were issued warnings, it said.</P>
      <P>Two of the toys -- both made in China -- contained levels of a plasticizer
called DEHP, or Di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate.</P>
      <P>One of the toys -- a small doll wearing traditional Korean clothing -- not only
contained DEHP at 117 times the limit, but also contained 2.8 times more lead
than acceptable, the foundation said.</P>
      <P>An animal-shaped coin bank from a shopping website contained 126 times the legal
limit of DEHP and also failed to pass a physical test as its sharp edges could
cause injuries to children's skin or eyes, it said.</P>
      <P>The foundation said DEHP is a chemical that can interfere with children's
endocrine systems, causing feminization in males and increasing females' risk of
breast cancer.</P>
      <P>Excess exposure to lead may interfere with the development of the nervous system
and cause acute toxicity, it added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A former Chi Mei Optoelectronics Corp. executive agreed to plead guilty of
playing a role in a global conspiracy to fix flat panel prices, making him the
latest in a line of former executives implicated in the case, the U.S.
Department of Justice (DOJ) said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>In a statement, the DOJ said Kuo Cheng-lung, the former vice president of sales
at the Taiwanese thin-film-transistor liquid crystal display (TFT-LCD) firm,
agreed to serve jail time of nine months and pay a criminal fine of US$35,000.</P>
      <P>Under the plea agreement, which is subject to court approval, Kuo also agreed to
help the DOJ continue the antitrust investigation.</P>
      <P>Kuo is the fourth Chi Mei executive  to plead guilty of participating in the
alleged price fixing, which is said to have taken place between April 2004 and
December 2006.</P>
      <P>Chi Mei was renamed Chimei Innolux Corp. in March after a merger with Innolux
Display Corp. and TPO Displays Corporation.</P>
      <P>Chimei Innolux declined to comment on Kuo's plea. Kuo retained a position in
Chimei Innolux after the new company was formed, but Chimei Innolux declined to
elaborate on Kuo's current job at the company.</P>
      <P>According to a one-count felony charge filed at a U.S. District Court in San
Francisco, Kuo conspired with others to suppress and undermine competition by
fixing the prices of TFT-LCD panels.</P>
      <P>The charges allege he and others agreed to charge predetermined prices for TFT-
LCD panels, exchanged information on TFT-LCD panel sales, and issued price
quotations to adhere to the agreed-upon prices.</P>
      <P>Kuo has been charged with violating the Sherman Act, which carries a maximum
penalty of 10 years in prison and a US$1 million fine for individuals.</P>
      <P>Including Kuo, a total of 19 executives and eight companies in Taiwan, Japan and
South Korea have been indicted by the DOJ in the case and more than US$890
million in criminal fines have been obtained, the department said.</P>

      <P>Taiwan share prices closed down 0.44 percent Thursday after profit taking
emerged to erode early gains following a rebound on Wall Street overnight,
dealers said.</P>
      <P>The weighted index fell 35.81 points to 7,936.85, after moving between 7,921.98
and 8,018.14, on turnover of NT$156.21 billion (US$4.91 billion).</P>
      <P>The market opened up 0.47 percent on Wall Street gains that were based on
improving U.S. payroll data.</P>
      <P>At one point, the Taiex breached the key 8,000 point mark before profit taking
set in amid fears that a major pullback would follow, dealers said.</P>
      <P>A total of 2,263 stocks closed down and 1,414 up, while 299 remained unchanged.</P>
      <P>The cement sector suffered the heaviest losses, dropping 2.1 percent. The
foodstuff sector closed down 1.9 percent, the paper and pulp sector finished 1.1
percent lower, the textile sector lost 0.7 percent and the machinery and
electronics sector fell 0.6 percent.</P>
      <P>The plastics and chemical sector fell 0.2 percent and the financial sector lost
0.1 percent, while the construction sector rose 0.1 percent.</P>
      <P>"The profit taking showed that technical resistance ahead of the 8,000-point
mark remained in place, " Grand Cathay Securities analyst Mars Hsu said.</P>
      <P>Hsu said concerns over possible slower growth of the global high tech sector
kept many investors away from local electronics stocks. Meanwhile, the mixed
U.S. economic data has made it more difficult for investors to get a clear
picture of the global economic climate, he said.</P>
      <P>Due to uncertainty over corporate earnings, he said, it was no surprise that
investors pocketed profits and ran as the market moved closer to the technical
barriers.</P>
      <P>"As the bellwether electronics sector remains weak, it will not be easy for the
local bourse to clear the technical hurdles anytime soon," Hsu said.</P>
      <P>Apart from the high tech sector, old economy stocks also encountered pressure
after a recent strong showing, Hsu said.</P>
      <P>"With the presence of strong non-high tech stocks, the market was able to remain
well above 7,900 points, " he said. "However, I'm afraid that interest in the
old economy sector will continue to fade and the market could turn weak
technically."</P>
      <P>In the high tech sector, personal computer vendor Acer fell 2.74 percent to
NT$85.20 and rival AsusTek dropped 2.79 percent to NT$244.00, while United
Microelectronics Corp. closed up 0.70 percent at NT$14.40.</P>
      <P>Among the old economy stocks, Taiwan Cement fell 2.01 percent to NT$29.30 and
Wei-Chuan Foods dropped 3.46 percent to NT$37.70.</P>

      <P>Parents should spend more time with their children despite heavy work loads,
President Ma Ying-jeou said during a parent-child event at the Presidential
Office Thursday.</P>
      <P>Due to the Typhoon Morakot disaster in August last year, the activity was
canceled. This year, staff members resumed the tradition of bringing their
children to the office for a half day of fun and laughter.</P>
      <P>"When I see your kids, I am reminded of raising my own," he said. "Back then, my

      <P>He said he used to spend a lot of time with his children, teaching them how to

they don't see each other as often.</P>
      <P>"My advice for parents is that kids grow up so fast, " he said. "Before you know

    <HEADLINE>President welcomes start of FTA talks with Singapore: spokesman</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 5 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou is pleased that talks have started with Singapore on an
economic cooperation agreement, Presidential Office spokesman Lo Chih-chiang
said Thursday.</P>
      <P>"President Ma is satisfied with the work of the administrative team as it has
begun negotiations with Singapore on an economic cooperation  deal shortly after
concluding a landmark economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) with China
on June 29, " Lo said.</P>
      <P>The Taipei Representative Office in Singapore and the Singapore Trade Office in
Taipei issued a joint statement earlier in the day, saying that the feasibility
of an economic cooperation pact between their two countries will be explored.</P>
      <P>Lo said this is in keeping with the president's promise to start FTA talks with
Taiwan's other major trading after securing the ECFA with China.</P>
      <P>Forging a comprehensive  economic  cooperation  accord with Singapore  will
contribute  significantly  to Taiwan's economic development, Lo said, noting
that Singapore has a strategic location in Southeast Asia, is a regional
economic powerhouse and is Taiwan's sixth largest trading partner.</P>
      <P>Moreover, he said, a trade deal with Singapore can serve as a foundation from
which Taiwan can build closer economic relations with its other major trading
partners because the city state already has trade pacts and economic cooperation
agreements with many other countries such as India, Japan and various member
states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).</P>
      <P>In response to the opposition Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP's) comments
that a free trade pact with Singapore would be of little significance given the
small volume of bilateral trade, Lo said the DPP's criticism was illogical in
light of its claim that Ma was taking credit for his predecessor's efforts.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and Singapore were close to signing a free trade agreement in 2004 when
the DPP was in power. However, the deal was dropped partly because of Beijing's
opposition and the DPP administration's insistence on signing the pact in the
name Taiwan.</P>
      <P>A DPP official said Wednesday that the contents of the agreement the Ma
administration is seeking to sign with Singapore will be roughly the same as in
the 2004 proposal.</P>
      <P>Lo urged the DPP to let go of its "sour grapes" mentality, get behind the
proposed FTA deal with Singapore and give the government credit for trying to
sign an agreement that will be beneficial to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to the joint statement, Taiwan and Singapore will negotiate the
economic cooperation agreement under the framework of the World Trade
Organization (WTO) , with Taiwan being called "the Separate Customs Territory of
Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu (Chinese Taipei)."</P>
      <P>Lo said the title was adopted by the DPP administration to facilitate Taiwan's
admission to the WTO in 2002.</P>

      <P>The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) called on China Thursday to review its Anti-
Secession Law targeting Taiwan, which  the council  described  as "something
unnecessary"  in cross-Taiwan Strait relations.</P>
      <P>According to MAC Vice Chairman Liu Te-shun, the law is impeding the development
of ties between Taipei and Beijing.</P>
      <P>"With the two sides having built a communication platform and accumulated more
mutual trust, there is a need to review the law's implementation framework," Liu
said in a news conference.</P>
      <P>He was responding to a question as to whether MAC Chairwoman Lai Shin-yuan was
referring to the Anti-Secession Law when she urged Beijing to abolish policies
and laws concerning military deployments targeting Taiwan while giving a speech
in Washington D.C. Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Liu also suggested that China adjust rules governing visits to Taiwanese
prisoners held in China in line with a cross-strait judicial cooperation
agreement signed last year.</P>
      <P>He said there is a need for the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) to establish
direct contact with various local governments in China to step up the

    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairwoman Lai Shin-yuan said Wednesday in
Washington, D.C. that President Ma Ying-jeou's cross-Taiwan Strait policy has
helped ease tension between Taiwan and China, a development that allows Taiwan
to establish a new momentum for national growth.</P>
      <P>In a speech delivered at the American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy
Research (AEI) , Lai said that several agreements that Taiwan has signed with
China are based on parity and dignity and the principle of "putting Taiwan first
for the benefit of the people, " and have received the support of Taiwan's
mainstream public opinion.</P>
      <P>According to a recent poll conducted in Taiwan, about 79.3 percent of the
respondents said they support institutionalized cross-strait negotiations, while
73.1 percent expressed satisfaction with a cross-strait agreement on
intellectual  property rights protection and 61.1 percent said they are
satisfied with the economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) Taiwan signed
with China in June, Lai said.</P>
      <P>The ECFA has also won widespread international recognition, Lai said, adding
that the United States, Japan, France, Germany, the rest of the European Union,
Singapore, New Zealand and Thailand, as well as World Trade Organization
Director-General Pascal Lamy, have welcomed the cross-strait trade pact.</P>
      <P>Lai said the ECFA will not only institutionalize cross-strait economic and trade
ties but could also help with the globalization of Taiwan's economy. On the
trend of regional economic integration, she said the Taiwanese government
expects a comprehensive free trade area to be established in Asia before 2020.</P>
      <P>The ECFA will help Taiwan gradually integrate into the regional economy and the
global economy and avoid being marginalized, Lai predicted.</P>
      <P>It is also expected to benefit American enterprises that want to invest in Asia,
she said.</P>
      <P>Lai said that the ECFA's "early harvest" lists of items subject to tariff
concessions or exemptions will be of more beneficial to Taiwan than to China
because Taiwan's list will allow 539 export items, worth US$13.83 billion, while
China's list includes 267 items, worth a mere US$2.86 billion. At present, the
total amount of Taiwan's exports to China is about four times that of China's
exports to Taiwan, she added.</P>
      <P>Lai also told the AEI scholars that with the support of its international
friends like the United States, Taiwan will be able to flex its clout in the
face of a rising China.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has many times requested that the U.S. should continue arms sales to
Taiwan without negotiating with Beijing on the matter, she went on.</P>
      <P>Saying that China's continuing military deployments and its refusal to renounce
the use of force against Taiwan could hinder the normal development of cross-
strait relations, Lai urged the Chinese authorities to change their way of
thinking and adjust their policies in the wake of the improvements in bilateral
relations in order to build mutual trust and achieve real peace across the
Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Lai is the first Taiwanese official in charge of Chinese affairs to visit
Washington since the signing of the ECFA.</P>
      <P>In addition, according to a statement issued Thursday by the MAC in Taipei, Lai
said in the speech that as a member of the WTO, Taiwan has the right to decide
whether it will sign free trade agreements (FTAs) with its trade partners,
adding that this right belongs to Taiwan rather than China.</P>
      <P>According to Lai,  many countries and trade partners have displayed interest in
negotiating FTAs with Taiwan and the government is studying the possibility of
doing so.</P>

      <P>The sodium content of 50 percent of the oyster and clam extract products on the
Taiwan market is much higher than the levels stated on the labels, the
Consumers' Foundation said Thursday.</P>
      <P>This could mislead people into consuming more sodium than they should, the
foundation warned after conducting tests on 12 oyster and clam extract products
that were bought in Taipei and Taichung.</P>
      <P>The results of the tests, which were done in April, show that in six of the
products, the sodium content was more than 20 percent higher than what was
stated on the labels.</P>
      <P>Currently, the maximum margin of error allowed on sodium labeling is 20 percent.</P>
      <P>According to Yu Kai-hsiung, publisher of Consumers News, a monthly  issued by
the foundation,  the manufacturers  of the inaccurately labeled products have
violated the Act Governing Food Sanitation and can be fined up to NT$200,000.</P>
      <P>Yang Nai-yen, a retired professor of food science who currently serves as the
convener of the foundation's food committee, said the recommended daily sodium
intake is 2,400 milligrams, which is equal to 6 grams of salt.</P>
      <P>However, he said, many people consume up to 18 grams of salt per day, which can
be harmful to their health.</P>
      <P>In response to the test results, Taiwan Sugar Corp., the manufacturer of one of
the clam extract products, explained that the high margin of error could have
been caused by seasonal factors because clams are a natural ingredient.</P>
      <P>The sodium level stated on the label represented the average of three batches of
products, the company said.</P>
      <P>It said the sodium content in the batch of clam extract tested by the Consumers
Foundation ranged between 56.42 milligram and 80.6 milligrams per bottle, which
should not pose a health risk if consumers drink only one bottle per day as
recommended by the company.</P>
      <P>Clam and oyster extract is sold in Taiwan in liquid and tablet form.</P>

      <P>Taiwanese negotiators headed to the Chinese coastal city of Xiamen Thursday, via
a direct ferry service from the outlying island of Kinmen, for a meeting with
Chinese officials on a dispute over the number of direct flights across the
Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) , however, did not disclose whether
Taiwan and China negotiators would begin talks on the matter later Thursday or
wait until Friday.</P>
      <P>Based on the precedent established in previous cross-strait aviation talks, the
two sides are likely to hold informal discussions first to sound out the bottom
lines before  starting  formal negotiations the following day. In some cases,
the two sides have held a dinner party to break the ice for the formal talks
next day.</P>
      <P>Chinese sources said Wednesday  a delegation  headed by a department chief of
the General Administration of Civil Aviation of China was scheduled to fly to
Xiamen Thursday for a meeting with its Taiwanese counterpart to seek a solution
to the dispute over increasing the number of cross-strait flights.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese and Chinese officials had agreed in May to allow carriers from each
side to fly 50 additional nonstop cross-strait flights per week, starting in
June, to meet growing market demand.</P>
      <P>As part of the deal, carriers from each country have been operating 14 new
weekly flights between Taipei's Songshan Airport and Shanghai's Hongqiao Airport
since mid-June.</P>
      <P>But China rejected most of the other applications by Taiwanese carries for new
flight routes because the arrangement would not have met Beijing's requirement
that 20 of the 50 new flights serve Xiamen or Fuzhou. The two cities are
adjacent to the Haixi special economic zone, one of the areas that China has
prioritized for development.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese officials, however, have said the May agreement did not require Taiwan
carriers to operate any additional flights to the two Chinese cities since the
airlines were already running a total of 22 weekly flights to those destinations
as part of their original quota of 135 flights per week.</P>
      <P>After China rejected the Taiwanese carriers' applications, Taiwan retaliated by
ordering Chinese carriers to suspend 31 of their 36 newly approved cross-strait
flights with effect from Aug. 1, and the other five flights from Oct. 30.</P>
      <P>With the dispute disrupting the plans of Taiwanese and Chinese carriers, China
agreed to reopen talks on the issue.</P>

      <P>Computer manufacturer Acer Inc. said Thursday that it plans to sign a licensing
agreement with China's Founder Group authorizing the Taiwanese firm to market
Founder products in China.</P>
      <P>It will be the latest step in mutual cooperation after the two companies inked a
memorandum of understanding (MOU) in May with the aim of expanding their
information technology and communications business in China.</P>
      <P>"We are in talks on the licensing accord. Acer is expected to pay Founder less
than US$70 million in royalties over the seven-year licensing period," an Acer
spokesman said.</P>
      <P>He said Acer will be responsible for the operation of most of the Founder-
branded PC business through product planning and marketing as well as supply
chain management.</P>
      <P>Founder's plant in Suzhou, in China's Jiangsu Province, will work with Acer in
product development for the Chinese market, while Founder will serve as a
service provider for Acer's after-sales service network there.</P>
      <P>"Acer is expected to share profits with Founder through the cooperation," the
spokesman said.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the MOU, Acer will use Founder's broad distribution network
in China to sell Acer products in tier 4-6 Chinese cities -- which have
populations of less than 20,000 -- as well as in rural areas.</P>
      <P>Acer has also targeted corporate and government clients in China, taking
advantage of the ties Founder has already established.</P>
      <P>"We hope the cooperation with Founder will boost both sides' market shares in
China," the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>Acer expects that its revenue in China will reach US$2.5 billion by 2011 through
the cooperation with Founder, compared with US$843 million recorded in 2009.</P>
      <P>Currently, China accounts for about 5 percent of Acer's total revenue.</P>
      <P>"It is the right move for Acer to work with Founder, as it is trying to
penetrate the huge Chinese market, " said Tracy Tsai, an analyst with Gartner,
an information technology research and advisory firm.</P>
      <P>"Founder, which is partially owned by the Chinese authorities, is expected  to
help Acer secure deals with Chinese  state-owned enterprises," Tsai said.</P>
      <P>Tsai said Acer and Founder complement each other, with Acer having strength in
notebook computer sales and Founder excelling in sales of desktop PCs.</P>
      <P>According to Gartner, Acer ranked the sixth-largest PC vendor in China with a 3
percent market share in the first quarter of this year, while Founder was in
fourth place with a 6 percent market share.</P>

      <P>Cheng said that in 2005 South Korea earmarked NT$2.8 billion (US$90 million) for
a "Korean medicine" research institute that was established in 1994 and is

percent and dentists at 20.79 percent, Cheng said.</P>
      <P>Outpatient spending on Chinese medicine totaled NT$18.7 billion in 2008,
accounting for only 4.07 percent of National Health Insurance expenditure. The
figures only rose slightly to NT$19.2 billion and 4.03 percent the following
year, Cheng said.</P>
      <P>Accusing  the government  of ignoring  the development  of traditional medicine,
Cheng and Chao said none of the DOH ministers or deputy ministers in Taiwan's
history have ever received training in traditional medicine.</P>
      <P>The two suggested that the government name a traditional medicine expert as DOH
deputy minister to devise a long-term development strategy for the industry.</P>
      <P>In addition, the government should funnel more resources into research and
establish a Chinese medicine inpatient departmental system in hospitals, they
said.</P>

      <P>Several non-governmental organizations said at a press conference Thursday that
Taiwan's low birth rate has much to do with its non-formal child care system.</P>
      <P>In comparison to some Northern European countries where birth rates have been on
the rise because of well-established child care systems, Taiwan's birth rate has
dropped 37 percent in the last 10 years, said Y.S. Liu, head of the Coalition
for Childcare Policy.</P>
      <P>Young (Taiwan) couples have stopped wanting children, she said. The society will
be in grave danger if the government does not take this issue seriously, she
warned.</P>
      <P>She linked the issue to the cost of day care centers in Taiwan, which she
described as profitable businesses that charge fees unaffordable to most
parents.</P>
      <P>The government should draw up an affordable child care plan to meet the needs of
working class families, she said.</P>
      <P>It should also set up an autonomous committee to monitor all matters related to
child care, she suggested.</P>
      <P>According to the 2010 World Population Data Sheet, Taiwan has the lowest total
fertility rate in the world of 1.0, which represents the average number of
children per woman in her lifetime.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of Taoyuan residents who face having their houses or farms expropriated
to make way for a section of an elevated railway system in the northern  county
held a press conference at the Legislative Yuan Thursday to protest against the
county government's planned expropriation.</P>
      <P>Opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Legislator Huang Jen-shu, who
accompanied the protesters at the press conference, said the county government
is pushing the elevated railway project, under which 4,000 houses  and about 300
hectares  of land will be expropriated, affecting hundreds of farmers.</P>
      <P>According to Huang, because the county government plans to build a 60-meter-wide
avenue along the course of the railway line, it needs to expropriate even more
farmland for the project.</P>
      <P>The dispute is mainly because of the fact that the county government cannot
afford the high construction fees or the amount of compensation demanded by the
residents for the land expropriation, Huang said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, as a station is planned on part of the Chung Yuan Christian
University campus, the government will have to expropriate more farmland to
compensate the university in return, Huang added.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator  Kuo Jung-chung  also said that the county government told local
residents that the elevated railway project would cost only NT$30.8 billion, but
he said this would only cover construction fees. If an additional estimated
NT$30 billion required for building the avenue and a further NT$50 billion for
land expropriation and relocation compensation are added, the figure reaches
NT$110.8 billion.</P>
      <P>"Of course we feel vexed. Our families have lived here for several generations,
" said A-su, a representative of a self-help association against land
expropriation for the project, adding that the local government should be more
considerate while undertaking expropriations.</P>
      <P>"I am so old, where can I move to if my house is torn down and my land
expropriated?" she asked.</P>
      <P>Hsieh Hsin-man, deputy chairman of the association, complained that the local
government did not even communicate with them before deciding to seize their
land, saying that it reminded him of the Miaoli county government's seizure of
farmland to expand a science park.</P>
      <P>The science park project sparked strong protests from local farmers and the
general public because of the local government's attempts to expropriate an
additional five hectares of farmland in addition to the original 23 hectares
allocated for the project.</P>
      <P>In the wake of the public outcry, the Miaoli county government offered an
apology and promised to compensate 24 farmers with plots of land the same size
as their former properties.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's consumer price index (CPI) rose 1.31 percent in July from a year
earlier, largely on higher food prices and tourism costs, the government said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>The July CPI rose 0.31 percent from June, as airfares and the cost of overseas
tours spiked in the summer vacation, which is the peak tourism season, the
Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) said.</P>
      <P>In July, food prices rose 2.19 percent from a year earlier, with vegetable
prices up 12.40 percent, fish prices 7.44 percent higher and meat prices rising
2.86 percent, the DGBAS said. However, egg prices dropped 10.86 percent, it
added.</P>
      <P>During the same period, transportation costs rose 1.48 percent year-on-year,
largely in reflection of higher fuel prices, it said.</P>
      <P>Last month, the core price index, which excludes vegetables, fruits, fish and
energy prices, rose 0.73 percent from a year earlier. The wholesale price index
(WPI) added 5.34 percent from a year earlier on higher base metal and raw

      <P>Month-on-month, the core price index gained 0.10 percent, while the WPI fell

      <P>A Control Yuan report that an Executive Yuan decision to pay half of the overdue
labor insurance and national health insurance premiums run up by the
municipalities of Taipei and Kaohsiung is not based on law prompted a war of
words between the two mayoral candidates in Taipei Thursday.</P>
      <P>Mayor Hau Lung-bin, who is bidding for re-election, said the Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) administration between 2000 and 2008 should shoulder the
blame for its failure to revise the law, which led to the problem.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile his DPP election rival, Su Tseng-chang, who served as premier
2006-2007, said the trouble should be resolved by its maker who he named as
President Ma Ying-jeou, Hau's predecesor in City Hall.</P>
      <P>Asked to comment on the Control Yuan's report the previous day, Hau said the
problem arose from the unfair regulations that oblige the city government to
subsidize the insurance premiums for all of the 2.2 million employees of the
companies headquartered in the city, a figure that is almost equivalent to the
city's entire 2.62 million population.</P>
      <P>While serving as head of the city, Ma withheld payment of the premiums, arguing
that it was beyond the city's means and that City Hall should subsidize only
workers who actually reside in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Hau said the DPP should  bear the lion's  share  of the responsibility  for the
problem  because  it arose under  its administration, which took over the city's
power to impose business tax on companies in the city.</P>
      <P>For his part, Su said the problem would not have arisen had Ma followed the law
during his term as mayor. As the head of state, with his Kuomintang controlling
both the Legislative  Yuan and the Executive Yuan, Ma should shoulder the full
responsibility and solve the problem, Su said.</P>
      <P>"Blaming the previous administration for whatever problems befall the successor
is really unbecoming for a ruling party, " according to Su.</P>
      <P>When Ma came to power in the 2008 presidential election, Taipei City had already
run up arrears of NT$49.5 billion, not to mention the NT$12.6 billion in arrears
incurred by Kaohsiung City prior to 2005 under the DPP.</P>
      <P>Under Ma's administration, the two cities agreed in November 2009 to repay half
of their arrears by installment over five and six years, respectively, with the
Executive Yuan bearing the other half. However, this arrangement was described
by the Control Yuan in its report the previous day as "questionable."</P>
      <P>Huang Huang-hsiung and Chien Lin Whei-jun, the two Control Yuan members who
authored the report, said the Executive Yuan should be blamed for failing to
revise the law to resolve the longstanding problem.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's national university baseball team bounced back from a disappointing
loss and its worst finish in the World University Baseball Championship to rout
Sri Lanka 21-0 in five innings Thursday in Tokyo, Japan.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan team is scheduled to play Canada for the fifth place Friday in
Tokyo's Meiji Jingu Stadium. But whether Taiwan wins or loses that game, this
year will be its worst showing at the tournament. Taiwan finished third in 2008,
second in 2006 and fourth in 2004 and 2002.</P>
      <P>In the quarterfinal game against Japan Wednesday, Taiwan was blanked 0-13 in
seven innings.</P>
      <P>The defeat dealt a devastating blow to the team but also served as a great
lesson, said team manager Yeh Chih-shien, who has participated in all five
championships.</P>
      <P>"These players are among the best at the college and amateur level in Taiwan, "
he said. " We've learned from the loss that Taiwan still has a long way to go to
compete with the best teams in the world," he added.</P>
      <P>By Thursday, the team had reorganized and it blasted 19 hits against Sri Lanka.
Newcomer Huang Yi-kun had three hits, including two home runs, and drove in six
runs.</P>
      <P>Yeh, who was not happy with Taiwan's inconsistent offense, said that the key
against Canada will once again be the team's offensive performance.</P>

      <P>An exhibition featuring new environmental art from Taiwan will open Aug. 6 at
the Asian Arts Initiative and the Schuylkill Center for Environmental Education
in Philadelphia, the United States, an official of the Council for Cultural
Affairs (CCA) said in Taipei Thursday.</P>
      <P>The exhibition, titled "Going Green: New Environmental Art from Taiwan, "
included outdoor environmental installations from two artists, with works by 14
other contemporary artists from Taiwan displayed in the gallery at the Asian
Arts Initiative.</P>
      <P>The exhibition is curated by Jane Ingram Allen, who initiated the Guandu
International Outdoor Sculpture Festival in Taiwan in 2006 and was curator of
that environmental art exhibition for four consecutive years.</P>
      <P>The exhibition, sponsored by the Taipei Cultural Center in New York, focuses on
environmental issues such as global warming, pollution and waste disposal,
according to the CCA.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese artists Lee Chao-chang and Pan Pin-yu, who are both currently artists
in residence at the Schuylkill Center, will showcase their outdoor works at the
event. Lee's work, titled "Everything is Buddha, " uses natural materials, such
as vegetables and fruit collected from visitors,  while Pan has created an
installation called "Ark for Plants" which is constructed from fallen branches
surrounding a young tree, forming a protective boat-like structure.</P>
      <P>"Audiences will understand the unique viewpoint and approach of Taiwan's
contemporary artists through this event," the official said, adding that the
artists have begun to focus on environmental issues that are important for
Taiwan and the world.</P>
      <P>The event will run through Aug. 20 and will then go on tour to the Accident
Gallery in Eureka, California in September, and then to the University of North

      <P>A planned economic cooperation agreement (ECA) between Taiwan and Singapore will
help Taiwan effectively explore the Southeast Asian and South Asian markets,
Minister of Foreign Affairs Timothy C.T. Yang said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is seeking to forge such an accord with Singapore because of the city
state's role in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), not simply
because it is an important trade partner of Taiwan, Yang said.</P>
      <P>"A Taiwan-Singapore economic cooperation agreement should help Taiwan step up
its relations with the 10 ASEAN member states as well as India," he added.</P>
      <P>Yang made the remarks after Taiwan and Singapore announced earlier in the day
that the two countries had agreed to explore the feasibility of building an ECA
-- the first of its kind -- based on the groundwork laid by an economic
cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) that Taiwan and China clinched in late
June.</P>
      <P>Two-way Taiwan-Singapore trade totaled US$13.4 billion in 2009, with the figure
for the first half of this year reaching US$9.3 billion.</P>
      <P>Earlier that same day, Vanessa Shih, Taiwan's representative to Singapore,
announced that under the framework of the World Trade Organization, the two
countries will start relevant talks beginning this year.</P>
      <P>ASEAN, China, the United States and the European Union are Taiwan's prime trade
partners.</P>
      <P>Asked why the proposed Taiwan-Singapore ECA will not be called a free trade
agreement (FTA) , Yang explained that the content covered by an FTA is usually
narrower compared to a general economic cooperation agreement that could include
trade, services, merchandise and a trade arbitration mechanism.</P>
      <P>Taiwan might next contact Malaysia and the Philippines for the same purpose,
according to ruling Kuomintang Legislator Lai Shyh-bao.</P>
      <P>According to local newspapers, Taiwan and Japan also kicked off talks on a
bilateral investment guarantee agreement in Tokyo that day.</P>

      <P>For the first time ever, Taiwan will hold a marathon on Yangming mountain in
suburban Taipei on Saturday, the organizers said Thursday.</P>
      <P>"Road running events have been held on Yangmingshan over the past 18 years, but
never a marathon, " said Sunny Chen, secretary-general of the Chinese Taipei
Road Running Association.</P>
      <P>About 5,000 runners, including 32 foreign participants, will compete in the
Yangmingshan Summer Marathon, on a scenic 42 kilometer route up and down hills,
Chen said. The course starts at 450 meters above sea level and winds uphill to
an altitude of 750 meters then drops to 45 meters above sea level, she said.</P>
      <P>The Yangmingshan marathon is the second race in a series of four seasonal
international marathons sponsored by the Ministry of the Interior (MOI) and held
in Taiwan's major national parks this year.</P>
      <P>The idea is to attract more people to the country and give them an opportunity
to experience its natural beauty and biodiversity, according to the MOI.</P>
      <P>The spring marathon, which took place in Kenting National Park in southern
Taiwan, attracted 5,000 runners, Chen said.</P>
      <P>The autumn event will be held in Kinmen National Park in the offshore Kinmen
County and the winter race will be staged at Taroko National Park in eastern
Taiwan, she said.</P>
      <P>Among the top foreign runners who will be competing Saturday are Kenyan Bernard
Mutai and Carolyne Chemutai Komen, both of whom are familiar with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Mutai, 31, won two marathons in the southern city of Tainan in 2008 and 2009.
Komen, 19, won the women's category of the Tainan marathon this year.</P>
      <P>According to Mutai, one of the challenges this time around will be the high
temperatures in Taipei, which have risen to 38.4 degrees Celsius this past week.</P>
      <P>Mutai said he has never ran a mountain race in such high temperatures.</P>
      <P>A half marathon and a 7-kilometer road race will also be held alongside

      <P>Single fathers talked about their parenting problems at a press conference held
by the Chinese Single Parent Association Thursday and asked the government to
provide free after-class child-care services in local elementary schools.</P>
      <P>One 48-year-old, a single father of two boys and one girl, said he finds it
difficult to strike a balance between work and family. Getting off work late in
the evening makes it impossible for him to pick up his children in the late
afternoon, he noted.</P>
      <P>However, reducing work hours would take a toll on the family's income and
sending the children to an after-school child-care center is too expensive, he
said.</P>
      <P>According to C.F. Chu, standing director of the Chinese Single Parent
Association, there are four kinds of single fathers -- those who cannot afford
child-care and thus rush around tiring themselves out, those who suffer from
marital status discrimination and negative stereotypes, those who are too busy
taking care of their children to go out and meet people and those who worry
about what might happen to their children if they are injured or sick.</P>
      <P>The association held the press conference to coincide with the approach of Aug.

    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Economic Affairs Shih Yen-shiang said Thursday that Taiwan and
Singapore have agreed to pursue a "high-quality" economic cooperation agreement
similar to a free trade agreement (FTA).</P>
      <P>The Taipei Representative Office in Singapore and the Singapore Trade Office in
Taipei issued a joint statement earlier in the day, saying that the feasibility
of an economic cooperation pact between their two countries will be explored.</P>
      <P>Shih said it has not yet been decided what the pact will be called,  but the two
sides have agreed that it should be a "high-quality" economic cooperation
agreement.</P>
      <P>"It will not be just a framework agreement but an FTA that can accomplish its
goal in one step, " he said on the sidelines of an economic seminar.</P>
      <P>As Singapore has a very limited agricultural sector, there will be an
opportunity  to explore  the market there for Taiwan's agricultural products,
Shih said.</P>
      <P>Noting that Singapore is a highly liberalized economy, the minister said it has
outstanding service industries -- particularly in the financial and
transportation sectors -- which will present opportunities for cooperation with
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Shih said that since the completion of Taiwan's landmark economic cooperation
framework agreement (ECFA) with China, many countries have been expressing
concerns  about the effects of economic integration in the Asia Pacific region.</P>
      <P>"The MOEA sincerely invites Singapore to pursue an economic cooperation
agreement with us, " Shih said, noting that it was the first among Taiwan's non-
allies to make such a move.</P>
      <P>Shih said earlier in the day that the proposed trade agreement with Singapore
represents a big step by Taiwan toward economic integration with its non-allies.</P>
      <P>As both sides have close economic and trade ties, the evaluation and negotiation
process of the trade agreement could be simplified in order to save time, he
said.</P>
      <P>Singapore is Taiwan's sixth-largest trading partner and its sixth-largest source
of foreign investment.</P>
      <P>Diplomatic officials have said that a Taiwan-Singapore trade pact would work
well for both countries because their economies are complementary rather than
competitive.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwanese English teacher relishes Cambridge-funded course</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Cambridge,  England, Aug. 5 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>A Taiwanese English teacher who was one of the five winners of a global
competition to attend a Cambridge University-funded  professional development
course has described the program as "terrific."</P>
      <P>"The two-week study program was very inspiring and fruitful, " said Tsai Pei-
jin, who works at Chien-Long Elementary School in northern Taiwan's Taoyuan
County.</P>
      <P>"It was really great to be able to attend the course, " she added in an
interview with CNA Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Tsai, who has taught English at elementary schools for eight years, won the
opportunity to join the program by participating in the English  for Schools
competition  held by Cambridge  ESOL Examinations early this year with the aim
of finding the best stories from English teachers around the globe.</P>
      <P>More than 2,000 non-native-speaking English teachers from 50 countries took up
the challenge in which they were tasked with writing 150 words on how the
teacher development course at Cambridge would benefit them and their students.</P>
      <P>Tsai said she got new inspirations and new perspectives every day while
attending the Bell Teacher Campus course at the prestigious university.</P>
      <P>Tsai said that among other things, she learned how to teach English through
storytelling and how to teach students to pronounce words using vivid and lively
body language with rich and varied expressions and gestures.</P>
      <P>"I will apply what I have learned here to my English teaching, " Tsai said,
adding she will also show her students group photos of her and the other
teachers who participated in the program, which she said will help them better
understand the world and foreign countries.</P>
      <P>During meals, the teachers were also able to exchange views on wide-ranging
topics, which Tsai described as "a brand new experience for me."</P>
      <P>Nearly all the teachers, regardless of their origin, said they had encountered
impolite behavior by unruly students in classes, Tsai went on.</P>
      <P>"We wrote about our experiences in dealing with such problems on posters in our
classroom at Cambridge, which enabled us to learn from each other," she added.</P>
      <P>According to Tsai, the 20-plus teachers on the course spoke nine different
languages. "It was like putting the world into a classroom, allowing us to
exchange our teaching experiences, " she said.</P>
      <P>The participating teachers come from various countries, including Spain,
Argentina, Poland, Vietnam, Taiwan and Kazakhstan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Industries alarmed over court rulings on science park</HEADLINE>

      <P>Injunctions from two administrative courts on the development of the Houli and
the Erlin branches of the Central Taiwan Science Park caused alarm Thursday
among local industries operating in the country's science parks.</P>
      <P>Shen Kuo-rung, vice president of the Association of Industries in Science Parks,
told a news conference at the Hsinchu Science Park that the rulings handed down
by the Taiwan High Administrative Court and the Supreme Administrative Court
have caused panic among local industries and have cast a shroud of uncertainty
over Taiwan's investment environment.</P>
      <P>On July 13, the Taiwan High Administrative Court ordered the Central Taiwan
Science Park to suspend its expropriation of land for its Erlin facility in
Changhua County until problems relating to an environmental impact assessment
have been sorted out.</P>
      <P>The same court ordered Aug. 2 the suspension of all development work in the
Central Science Park's Houli branch in Miaoli County on the grounds that the
it's environmental impact assessment had already been annulled by the Supreme
Administrative Court in January.</P>
      <P>The Central Taiwan Science Park Administration decided two days earlier to
appeal the Taiwan High Administrative's Aug. 2 ruling, but the ruling will hold
unless and until it is overruled by the Supreme Administrative Court.</P>
      <P>This means that the companies already operating in the Houli park have to stop
production and endure the loss entailed by the suspension.</P>
      <P>Among the companies hard-hit is the TFT-LCD giant AU Optronics (AUO) , whose two
factories in the Houli park, built at a cost of NT$200 billion (US$6.28 billion)
, are almost complete and were preparing to recruit workers early next year.</P>
      <P>The company's plan to build two 11th-generation TFT-LCD factories in the Erlin
park are also now in limbo because of the court's July 13 suspension order.</P>
      <P>In Thursday's news conference, Shen urged the Executive Yuan, especially the
Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) -- which is in charge of
environmental impact assessments -- and the National Science Council (NSC) --
which manages the country's science parks -- to come up with a remedy for the
situation.</P>
      <P>"I am really disappointed with the NSC's decision to abide by the court order to
the detriment of the companies in the park," he said.</P>
      <P>Citing AUO as an example, Shen said his association will support the company,
which has followed legal procedure in its park investment only to find its money
going down the drain, to fight against the court's suspension order by filing a
lawsuit with the administrative court.</P>
      <P>Sun Hung, another association official, said science parks are the the country's
economic locomotives, and that suspending the construction of the Erlin park
deals a blow not only to AUO but to companies that supply AUO with equipment and
materials, and also to companies waiting to buy AUO's products for processing.</P>
      <P>He suggested that the Executive Yuan should resist the court's orders to ensure
the continuous operation of companies in the Houli park while putting on hold --
but not for too long -- the construction work at the Erlin Park.</P>
      <P>"If the premier doesn't have the authority to negotiate with the judiciary for a
remedy, President Ma Ying-jeou should do it, " said Sun.</P>
      <P>He said the current regulations  for environmental  impact assessments are too
vague, which results in uncertainty and prolonged processes, which only
discourages investors.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Government Information Office Minister Johnny Chi-chen Chiang, the
spokesman for the Executive Yuan, said the Executive Yuan will spare no efforts
to see that the interests of companies in the Houli park are not compromised.</P>
      <P>"The NSC and the EPA will request the administrative court to refrain from
carrying out its suspension order while they appeal against it," Chiang said.</P>
      <P>However, the spokesman said, it is up to the court to decide whether to grant
such a request.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the EPA, which has been accused by many of failing to conduct a new
environmental impact assessment for the Houli park after the Supreme
Administrative Court struck down the original one in January this year, said it
does not deserve to be blamed.</P>
      <P>"We assess the environmental impact of a project at the request of the
organizers of the project, just like the court hands down judgment in suits
brought by plaintiffs, " the administration said in a statement, in a veiled
reference to the fact that the Houli and Erlin parks fall within the
jurisdiction of the Central Taiwan Science Park Administration or its superior,
the NSC.</P>
      <P>The statement did not say directly that the NSC should be held responsible.</P>
      <P>The statement came amid calls from opposition lawmakers for the EPA head, Shen
Shu-hung, to step down to take responsibility for the bungle.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan and Singapore  announced  Thursday  a plan to open negotiations on an
economic cooperation agreement. Although the name of the pact will not
necessarily be a free trade agreement (FTA), it is in substance a kind of FTA.</P>
      <P>The development is inspiring because it will bring Taiwan many positive
benefits.</P>
      <P>First, Singapore is one of Asia's four "little dragons" and a member of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) that maintains  close trade ties
with India.  Signing  an economic cooperation agreement with Singapore will not
only increase Taiwan's trade opportunities but also provide Taiwan access to the
ASEAN and Indian markets.</P>
      <P>Second, many countries have previously intended to negotiate FTAs with Taiwan
but have given up in the face of opposition from China. Singapore's move will
set an example for other countries.</P>
      <P>In addition, despite the rapid improvement in cross-Taiwan Strait relations
under the leadership of President Ma Ying-jeou, there are still doubts  in
Taiwan about China's  sincerity.  The latest development indirectly proves that
China has indeed adjusted its mindset and bottom line.</P>
      <P>Ma has achieved a diplomatic breakthrough that would have been unimaginable in
the past, which deserves our applause. (Editorial abstract -- Aug. 6, 2010)</P>

could not help but pose the question: "How many governments are there in
Taiwan?" to express his outrage that the company's previously  approved NT$600
billion investment plan has now been indefinitely put on hold.</P>
      <P>Indeed, businesses that have invested in the park according to the rules and
regulations set out by the government are confused as to whose orders they
should follow.</P>
      <P>Although the science park was required as early as four years ago to present a
health risk assessment as part of the environmental impact assessment process
for the expansion project, the park has not been able to meet the requirement,
and the Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) has not monitored the
park's efforts to do so. Even after the Supreme Administrative Court annulled in
January the results of an environmental impact assessment for the project, the
EPA still took no action against the park.</P>
      <P>This chain of events does not mean that Taiwan has many governments with
contradictory policies, but it shows that the science park and the EPA have been
over-eager in pursuing achievement and economic development, which has affected
the balance of the government's operation.</P>
      <P>We should correct the flaws in the current system instead of pointing fingers of
blame at each other. (Editorial abstract -- Aug. 6, 2010)</P>

    <HEADLINE>Talk of the day -- Taiwan's next FTA target: ASEAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>08/06/10  12:00:10
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Local society in general has hailed the imminent start of talks with Singapore
on signing an economic cooperation agreement as a breakthrough for Taiwan in its
pursuit of better foreign trade relations after decades of being overshadowed by
China.</P>
      <P>Beijing has long used its diplomatic clout to block Taiwan from signing free
trade agreements (FTAs) with its major trading partners. After Taiwan and China
signed their own economic  cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) in late June,
Beijing signaled that it was finally willing to let Taiwan negotiate trade pacts
with other countries under the framework of the World Trade Organization (WTO).</P>
      <P>Government officials said major member states of the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations (ASEAN) will be the next target for similar FTA-like deals.</P>
      <P>"We believe that via Singapore, we can strengthen our economic and trade ties
with the 10 ASEAN members, not to mention a continued focus on South Asia, "
said Minister of Foreign Affairs Timothy Yang at a news conference Thursday on
the plan to start trade pact talks with Singapore.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from the local media coverage of the topic:</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>A delegation  of think tank scholars have visited several Southeast Asian
nations recently at the behest of the President Ma Ying-jeou administration to
explore their interest in opening talks with Taiwan on FTA-like economic
cooperation accords.</P>
      <P>The delegation found that while all the countries approached showed keen
interest in signing FTAs with Taiwan, they also expressed concerns about China's
possible reaction to such a move.</P>
      <P>According to government sources, Beijing would not tolerate seeing its
diplomatic allies sign FTAs with Taiwan before concluding its own deal with
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Since the "ASEAN Plus One (China) " free trade bloc already took effect early
this year, the sources said, Beijing is no longer expected to obstruct Taiwan's
bid to strike similar deals with ASEAN member countries.</P>
      <P>In addition to Singapore, the sources said, the government hopes to conclude
FTA-like economic cooperation agreements with at least two other ASEAN
countries, with Malaysia and the Philippines topping the "wish list."</P>
      <P>China reacted carefully to a joint statement from Taiwan and Singapore on
exploring the feasibility of a bilateral trade pact, with Foreign  Ministry
spokeswoman  Jiang Yu urging "relevant countries" to handle the issue
"cautiously."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  China's Taiwan Affairs Office said in a brief statement carried by
the Xinhua news agency that it believes Singapore will abide by the "one China"
principle and appropriately handle economic and trade relations with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The Presidential Office issued a statement late Thursday praising China for not
interrupting Taiwan's bid to pursue a trade agreement with Singapore.</P>
      <P>"It's a practical move that is not only in line with the interests of Taiwan but
also is helpful to building peace and co-prosperity on both sides of the Taiwan
Strait, " presidential spokesman Lo Chih-chiang said.</P>
      <P>Political analysts said the statements from the Chinese and Taiwanese
authorities show that both sides have expressed goodwill, but political hurdles
remain in the way. Therefore, they said, it will take time for the two sides to
build up mutual trust before they can address any political disputes. (Aug.6,
2010).</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>Yang said that starting free trade pact talks with Singapore is a good start in
Taiwan's efforts to be included in the regional economic integration.</P>
      <P>"From a broader viewpoint, Taiwan cannot continue to be isolated in the face of
the mounting wave of regional economic integration, " Yang said, adding that
after the ECFA, Taiwan needs to pick up the pace of concluding economic
cooperation deals with its trading partners to sustain the development of its
export-driven economy. (Aug.6, 2010).</P>
      <P>Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>The opposition  Democratic Progressive  Party said the KMT administration should
focus its efforts on negotiating free trade agreements with Taiwan's major
trading partners such as the United States, Japan and the European Union rather
than Singapore.</P>
      <P>Two-way trade between Taiwan and Singapore stood at US$13.42 billion in 2009,
accounting for 3.55 percent of Taiwan's overall foreign trade.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Pan Meng-an said singing a free trade pact might lead to an
influx of goods from ASEAN countries via Singapore and that the government
should not ignore this threat while playing up the positive effects of signing
such a pact. (Aug. 6, 2010).</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council of Agriculture is continuing with efforts to promote a "fruit tree
adoption" program it launched last year to help fruit farmers affected by
Typhoon Morakot and revitalize the agricultural sector.</P>
      <P>The council's Agriculture and Food Agency said Friday that the program has
received a warm response from the public and has substantially   helped  fruit
farmers  re-establish  their typhoon-devastated orchards and ride out their
difficulties.</P>
      <P>With more help still needed to get typhoon-affected farmers back on their feet,
however, the agency is continuing to promote the adoption program.</P>
      <P>According to the agency, the trees can be adopted by "unit, " and the cost of
each "unit" this year has been adjusted downward to between NT$1,000 (US$32.25)
and NT$3,000 from last year's NT$2,500- NT$3,000, with the aim of encouraging
more people to join the drive.</P>
      <P>The types of fruit trees offered for adoption are bellfruit, jujube, papaya,
lychee, ai-wen mango, jin-huang mango and custard apple.</P>
      <P>Under the program, a guaranteed amount of fruit per unit, weighing from 6 kg to
18 kg, will be delivered to adopters during the harvest season, according to the
agency.</P>
      <P>The program will run through the end of October and all the fruit will be
delivered to adopters by the end of June 2011, depending on the respective
harvest seasons.</P>

    <DATELINE>08/06/10  12:11:05
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>In an interview with the Commercial Times, Minister of Economic Affairs Shih
Yen-shiang expressed optimism that Taiwan can secure a 6 percent economic growth
this year and has the potential to achieve growth of 7 percent or even 8
percent.</P>
      <P>However, two recent developments remind us that Taiwan's economic outlook is
probably no longer so optimistic. They are the dispute over the Central Taiwan
Science Park's third-phase and fourth-phase expansion projects and the decline
of the leading economic indicators in the United States, Europe and China.</P>
      <P>When these three "global economic engines"  begin to show sluggishness, how can
the global economy possibly not slow down? How can can Taiwan, which relies
heavily on exports, not be affected?</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  the suspension of the science park's expansion projects has
seriously  upset the business sector's investment confidence and added further
uncertainty to Taiwan's economy.</P>
      <P>Providing the business sector with predictable prospects is more important than
granting them tax reductions and loans. The government urgently needs to clear
up the controversy surrounding environmental impact assessments for industrial
development projects, and should consider requesting a constitutional
interpretation on the issue if necessary. (Editorial abstract -- Aug. 6, 2010)</P>

      <P>China Taisan Technology Group Holdings Ltd., a Chinese textile firm currently
listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange (SGX) , plans to raise funds in Taiwan
for expansion, underwriter Polaris Securities said Friday.</P>
      <P>"China Taisan has submitted an application with the Taiwan Stock Exchange to
issue Taiwan depository receipts (TDRs), " said a Polaris official in charge of
TDR underwriting.</P>
      <P>"The company is planning to raise NT$1.25 billion (US$39.33 million) from the
TDR sales to expand its production capacity in China," the official said.</P>
      <P>She said that once the share sale application is approved, the company will
issue 125 million TDRs, each of which will represent two common shares.</P>
      <P>China Taisan is a supplier of performance fabrics used in the production of
sportswear and casual wear for international brands such as Reebok, Nike,
Adidas, FILA and Lotto, as well as Chinese brands including Li-Ning, Qiaodan and
Septwolves.</P>
      <P>In 2009, the company posted 106 million Chinese yuan in net profits on sales of
832 million yuan. In the first quarter of this year, its net profit rose 65.3
percent from a year earlier to 56 million yuan, according to the Taiwan Stock
Exchange.</P>
      <P>Polaris said that as China Taisan's chief executive officer and co-founder, Lin
Wen Chang, is Taiwanese and the company's key positions in manufacturing, sales
and marketing are also mostly filled by Taiwanese staff, the company has shown a
lot of interest in issuing shares here.</P>
      <P>China Taisan's production facilities are located in Jinjiang, in China's Fujian
Province and the Chinese city is known as China's sportswear hub.  The company
has gained access to the entire production chain for sports and leisure apparel
in China, according to the company's website.</P>
      <P>The company has been listed in Singapore since 2008.</P>
      <P>China Taishan is the fifth foreign-listed company to seek to issue TDRs in
Taiwan so far this year, the Taiwan Stock Exchange said, adding if the review
process proceeds smoothly, the listing is expected in October.</P>
      <P>A total of 18 foreign-listed companies have issued TDRs in the local bourse.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's grouper industry has mostly recovered from the damage caused by Typhoon
Morakot last August, with an average of 80 percent of grouper aquaculture farms
having resumed operations, the Fisheries Agency said Friday.</P>
      <P>In order to help the industry to get back up and running, the government has
approved a total of NT$2.13 billion (US$67 million) in loans to farmers raising
grouper, mainly in Kaohsiung and Pingtung counties in southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The maximum amount of loans for grouper farms has been raised to NT$5 million
from NT$1 million per hectare, with loans for farmers raising giant grouper
raised to NT$8 million, according to the agency.</P>
      <P>Typhoon Morakot devastated southern Taiwan's agriculture and aquaculture sectors
a year ago, causing more than NT$1.7 billion in damage to fisheries alone,
nearly 60 percent of which occurred in Pingtung County.</P>
      <P>In the week after the typhoon, 1,515 tons of dead fish were removed from that
county alone, the agency said.</P>
      <P>The agency said it has spent NT$163 million helping grouper farmers to clear the
silt from their ponds, spread new soil, sanitize and improve water quality, and
purchase grouper fry and probiotics.</P>
      <P>The government also plans to provide half of the funds needed to build three
ships designed for transporting live fish, to a maximum total of NT$45 million,
the agency said.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese grouper are included on an "early harvest" list of goods and services
that will enjoy preferential tariff treatment under the landmark economic

      <P>Nearly 75 percent of Taiwan's office workers do not trust their colleagues on
account of clashes in interpersonal relationships, according to the results of
an online survey released Friday.</P>
      <P>The results of the survey conducted by 360d HR, an online job bank, showed that
74 percent of the respondents described the office environment as "dangerous, "
but 71 percent said they believe human nature is "basically good. "</P>
      <P>Only 6 percent of the respondents said they "totally trust their colleagues or
directors." Meanwhile, 42 percent said they cannot count on their directors,
higher than the 36 percent who said they have no confidence in their colleagues.</P>
      <P>In terms of the reasons cited by the respondents for their distrust of their
office co-workers, "people are all selfish" came first (43 percent) , followed
by "have been betrayed at work" (22 percent) and "have seen colleagues resorting
to any means to achieve goals" (20 percent).</P>
      <P>In terms of loyalty to their places of work, the survey also found that 37
percent of the respondents have little faith in their present company, with 62
percent of them expressing uncertainty about their future there and 21 percent
"considering a move to another company."</P>
      <P>Questioned on the methods they use to earn the trust of their colleagues, 57
percent answered "sharing workloads," while 15 percent cited "helping others at
work" and 11 percent mentioned "taking responsibility for work-related tasks."</P>
      <P>According to the survey, 62 percent of those polled said they get along well
with others in the same sector, with another 15 percent saying they do not
associate with their counterparts in other companies.</P>
      <P>In terms of personal interaction, 41 percent of the respondents said they meet

      <P>Taiwan share prices closed up 0.33 percent Friday as non-high-tech stocks staged
a technical rebound from losses incurred in the previous session, while the
bellwether electronics sector remained lackluster, dealers said.</P>
      <P>The weighted index rose 26.45 points to 7,963.30, after moving between 7,829.19
and 8,018.74, on turnover of NT$115.96 billion (US$3.65 billion).</P>
      <P>The market opened flat on an overnight fall on Wall Street ahead of the U.S.
non-farm payroll data due Friday, but buying in select old economy stocks, such
as food and textile firms, emerged during the trading session to lift the index,
the dealers said.</P>
      <P>A total of 1,729 stocks closed up and 1,723 were down, with 286 remaining
unchanged.</P>
      <P>The foodstuff sector made the most gains, up 2.5 percent, while textile stocks
rose 1.8 percent, cement issues grew 1.2 percent, plastics and chemicals added
0.9 percent and the construction sector rose 0.4 percent.</P>
      <P>Financial shares were up 0.3 percent and the machinery and electronics sector
closed up 0.1 percent, while paper and pulp shares fell 1.3 percent.</P>
      <P>"Funds have recently been moving to the old economy sector from the electronics
sector amid lingering concerns over global demand for high-tech products," TLG
Asset Management analyst Arch Shih said.</P>
      <P>"Before the U.S. releases its job figures tonight, foreign institutional
investors,  which  serve as the major high-tech shareholders, have appeared
unwilling to trade," Shih said.</P>
      <P>Shih said interest in the foodstuff  sector revived after Thursday's retreat on
a global shortage in commodities, in particular wheat, due to serious droughts
in Russia.</P>
      <P>"The old economy sector has become a safe haven as investors have tried to avoid
a possible major downturn among high-tech stocks, " Shih said, "Wise investors
should add these traditional industrial stocks to their portfolios for the
moment."</P>
      <P>He said stocks with close ties to China, including airline and shipping line
issues, are also worth investors' attention amid an increase in cross-Taiwan
Strait economic exchanges.</P>
      <P>The weighting of the non-high-tech sector, however, is relatively small, so
their strength is unlikely to get the broader market out of the current
consolidation, Shih said.</P>
      <P>In the foodstuff sector, Wei-Chuan Foods rose 5.17 percent to close at NT$39.65
and Great Wall gained 3.57 percent to end the day at NT$34.80.</P>
      <P>Among transport stocks, China Airlines added 1.29 percent for a closing price of
NT$19.60 and EVA Airways rose 1.36 percent to finish at NT$22.35.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. fell 1.62 percent to NT$60.90 at close of
trade, while United Microelectronics Corp. lost 0.34 percent to close at
NT$14.35.</P>

U.S. Open in New York later this month.</P>
      <P>World No. 44 Lu flew to Toronto from Washington D.C., where Colombia's Alejandro
Falla (No. 61) sent him out of the Legg Mason in straight sets.</P>

the tennis player's training.</P>
      <P>In a pre-recorded video screened at the auction venue, Lu expressed his
appreciation.</P>
      <P>Lu said tennis is the most important part of his life and that he looks forward
to achieving his best "so that you will feel it's worthwhile to collect my
EasyCards."</P>
      <P>The company has issued 300 sets of the cards for the sponsorship program, in
which buyers will receive a set of the cards with a minimum donation of
NT$1,000. The donations are being accepted through Lu's Web site at

      <P>The 26-year-old went further in a grand slam singles event than any Taiwanese

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou has not made any arrangements to visit Singapore as
reported in Taiwan's news media, the country's representative office in
Singapore said Friday.</P>
      <P>"The report about President Ma making a stopover in Singapore early next year on
his way to Africa to meet with Singaporean political heavyweights is not true, "
the Taipei Representative Office in Singapore said in a statement.</P>
      <P>It also insisted that no such arrangements have been made at present.</P>
      <P>Quoting unidentified "authoritative sources, " a local media outlet reported
Friday that Ma will make a transit stop en route to visiting Taiwan's African
allies in January 2011 to meet with Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong
and Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew.</P>
      <P>The report drew attention as it came a day after the Taipei Representative
Office in Singapore and the Singapore Trade Office in Taipei issued a joint
statement pledging to explore the feasibility of a bilateral economic
cooperation agreement.</P>
      <P>In Taipei, Minister of Foreign Affairs Timothy Yang also said the report was
incorrect, insisting that Ma's overseas travel plans for the coming year have
not been finalized.</P>
      <P>"Even if the president does indeed visit Africa next year, there are many routes
available to reach the destinations, " Yang said, adding that the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs (MOFA) will make a choice based on the principles of convenience
and comfort.</P>
      <P>Under Ma's flexible diplomatic policy, Taiwan has ceased a diplomatic tug-of-war
with China. Nevertheless, Yang said, Taiwan remains unwavering in its desire to
maintain close ties with its 23 diplomatic allies.</P>
      <P>"President Ma has expressed the hope of visiting all of our allies during his
term in office and the MOFA will arrange for him to visit our African allies at
the appropriate time," Yang said.</P>
      <P>"Next year should be good timing, " he said, but the schedule has yet to be
finalized.</P>
      <P>Since Ma assumed office in May 2008, he has been to almost all of Taiwan's
allies in Central and South America, the Caribbean and the South Pacific.</P>
      <P>He was originally scheduled to visit Taiwan's allies in Africa in July but
canceled the plan over concerns that he would be away during the typhoon season
and also because of the need to attend to other domestic affairs.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MediaTek July sales up 2.4 percent</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 6 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Integrated circuit designer MediaTek Inc. posted a 2.4 percent sales increase in
July from the previous month, reversing a double digit decline seen in June, the
company announced Friday.</P>
      <P>The July sales totaled NT$8.24 billion (US$259 million), up from NT$8.05 billion
recorded in June, when the monthly decline in sales was recorded as 18.43
percent.</P>
      <P>"The high-tech sector has entered the peak season of the year since July and the
month-on-month increase in July was the result of seasonal factors, " said
Julian Wang, an analyst with Grand Cathay Securities.</P>
      <P>"The impact from the Chinese government's efforts to crack down on tax evasion
of `bandit' cell phone makers remains in place and that is expected to continue
to depress demand for cell phone chips in China," Wang said.</P>
      <P>Cell phone chips are MediaTek's major source of revenue and about 75 percent of
its cell phone chip sales come from China, where makers of unbranded, or
"bandit" cell phones are the company's biggest customers.</P>
      <P>In May, sales also fell 18.14 percent from April, largely as a result of a tax
evasion crackdown in China on the "bandit" phone manufacturers.</P>
      <P>Wang said there have been concerns that demand in the second half of this year,
the sector's peak season, will not be as strong as the peak seasons in the past
as the global economy has shown signs of slowing.</P>
      <P>He said inventories in emerging markets such as India and the Middle East remain
high, which could affect shipments.</P>
      <P>"Furthermore, fierce competition from other IC designers is dragging down prices
and gross margins," Wang said, adding that "I do not expect MediaTek to have a
good third quarter."</P>
      <P>In the second quarter,  MediaTek's  gross margin fell 1.7 percentage points from
the first quarter to 55 percent. The company has forecast that its gross margin
will fall to 51.5 percent-53.5 percent in the third quarter.</P>
      <P>During the April-June period, MediaTek's net profit fell 18.9 percent from the
first quarter.</P>
      <P>TLG Asset Management analyst Arch Shih said the market is watching closely to
see how cooperation between MediaTek and NTT DOCOMO will help the Taiwanese firm
to weather the impact of falling demand from "bandit" cell phone makers by
moving toward higher-end cell phone chip development.</P>
      <P>"However, no obvious effect will be seen until next year, " said Shih.</P>
      <P>In July, MediaTek and NTT DOCOMO signed a licensing agreement to allow the
Taiwanese company to gain access to the Japanese partner's advanced long term
evolution technology.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Magazine digest -- Making Taiwanese fruit competitive abroad</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>08/06/10  18:07:39
(CommonWealth 452)(translated by Kay Liu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan is known for its quality fruit and outstanding breeding technology that
has developed a wide range of varieties, but fruit exports have been on the
decline over the past decade.</P>
      <P>The country's fruit exports have fallen from 73,000 tons in 2003 to fewer than
30,000 tons in 2009, according to the Council of Agriculture (COA).</P>
      <P>In contrast, fruit imports have remained steady at around 300,000 tons per year
over the past five years, but their value has doubled over that time, reflecting
their improving competitiveness.</P>
      <P>Here are some opinions from officials and executives in the business on how
Taiwan can better compete with commercialized fruit producers abroad.</P>
      <P>On distribution and marketing:</P>
      <P>Chen Yu-jan, the general manager of New Zealand's Zespri kiwi fruit brand in
Asia, suggested that because Taiwan's growers are small-scale operators and the
quantities of their harvests fluctuate, a fruit marketing cooperative that
understands overseas demand should be created so that farmers need not worry
about finding buyers.</P>
      <P>Tainan County Magistrate Su Huan-jhih said that once Taiwan takes China's market
more seriously and becomes involved in marketing and distribution, the problem
of Chinese-grown fruit being sold as fruit grown in Taiwan can be better
addressed.</P>
      <P>COA Minister Chen Wu-hsiung said that besides working closely with major Chinese
distributors, the council plans to assist Taipei Agricultural Products Marketing
Corp. in coordinating expansion and marketing efforts in the Chinese market.</P>
      <P>On government subsidies:</P>
      <P>Zespri International's Chen said Taiwan's government should not rely on
subsidizing farmers but should instead help them build their own brands to
market quality Taiwanese fruit.</P>
      <P>Zespri is owned by kiwi fruit growers to package and market their produce and
has farms in both the northern and southern hemispheres. By managing both
production and distribution and ensuring fruit quality, the company can provide
a stable supply of the fruit year round.</P>
      <P>Magistrate Su said Taiwan should focus on fruit that can be competitive in the
global market and divert subsidies spent on less competitive varieties to
finance overseas distribution, as is the case in South Korea.</P>
      <P>On branding and quality:</P>
      <P>Zespri's Chen said produce, unlike other products, is unique because of its
origin and growing environment. Taiwan, he said, has an opportunity in China
with branded quality fruit because Chinese consumers do not trust local
producers.</P>
      <P>Minister Chen said only a consistent fruit supply and quality can sustain stable
trade, and he contended that Taiwan should register the "Certified Agricultural
Standards" (CAS) and "Good Agriculture Practice" (GAP) labels in China to boost
the image of Taiwanese quality produce in the minds of Chinese consumers.</P>
      <P>Tainan  County's  mangoes  have  undergone  just  such  a transformation. Prior
to 2001, there was often a surplus of mangoes, which cost the central and local
governments tens of millions of Taiwan dollars every year in subsidies.</P>
      <P>However, by helping mango growers obtain GAP certification, with its strict
pesticide standard and requirement of keeping records at every step in the
growing process, the mangoes now sell for about US$11.50 each in Japan.</P>
      <P>Fruit exports are important because they help Taiwanese fruit growers avoid
sharp price drops in the domestic market. Only by bringing production in tune
with marketing to manage global sales can Taiwan's fruit become more competitive
abroad.</P>

      <P>More than 300 medical professionals have signed a petition against the
construction of a petrochemical complex in a coastal wetlands area in central
Taiwan and the expansion of Formosa Petrochemicals Corp's Mailiao refinery
complex, activists said Friday.</P>
      <P>The petition, which was initiated by five doctors from five hospitals around the
country last month, has been signed by 329 workers in the medical sector, said
Democratic Progressive Party Legislator Tien Chiu-chin at a press conference at
the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Tien said that although the petrochemical plant projects could help to create
more jobs, the air pollution they would cause could pose a health threat to the
entire population of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Such pollution could cause obstructive  pulmonary  disease, cardiovascular
problems, myocardial infarction and arrhythmias, among other problems, she said.</P>
      <P>Citing a study, Tien said that the Mailiao refinery and the petrochemical plant
planned by Kuokuang Petrochemical Technology Co. could generate enough pollution
to shorten the lives of all the people in Taiwan by 23 days on average.</P>
      <P>Doctor Chiang Chi-der from Tungs' Taichung MetroHarbor Hospital, who was one of
the initiators of the petition, said he is opposed to the two projects mainly
because the petrochemical industry is considered as a major source of industrial
air pollution.</P>
      <P>As a doctor who specializes in cardiopulmonary diseases, he said, he is worried
that long-term exposure to pollution could lead to asthma and an increased risk
of various types of cancer.</P>
      <P>At present, Taiwan makes enough petrochemical products to meet domestic  demand,
therefore,  there  is no need  for another petrochemical plant, Chiang said. New
petrochemical plants are being planned mainly to increasing exports and boost
business profits, he said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Wu Kuen-yuh, an associate professor at the Institute of Occupational
Medicine and Industrial Hygiene at National Taiwan University, said that the
government should not sacrifice public health for economic development.</P>
      <P>According to a health risk assessment that was conducted in 2006 by National
Cheng Kung University, one out of every 100,000 people could develop cancer as a
result of pollution from the expansion of the Formosa Petrochemical refinery, he
said.</P>
      <P>Wu accused the Environmental Protection Administration of easing the regulations
pertaining to health risk assessments to ensure approval of the Kuokuang
petrochemical plant.</P>
      <P>In addition, he said, a health risk assessment report on the Kuokuang project
issued by Chan Chang-chuan, a professor at National Taiwan University's College
of Public Health, stated that Formosa Petrochemical's Mailiao naphtha cracker
plant, which has been in operation since 1999, poses a health threat to the
residents of five townships in the central-south county of Yunlin where it is
located.</P>
      <P>The petition by the medical professionals was the latest in a series of
campaigns by environmental activists, university professors and Academia Sinica
against the projects.</P>
      <P>Another petition was expected to be launched Friday by people from cultural and
art circles, according to Shih Yueh-ying, secretary general of Changhua Coast
Conservation Action.</P>

      <P>The first 154 permanent houses built in Pingtung County's Changjhih Township for
residents displaced by Typhoon Morakot were opened for occupancy Friday ahead of
the Aug. 8 first anniversary of the disaster.</P>
      <P>The new community is intended to house Morakot victims from seven aboriginal
villages in Wutai and Sandimen townships.</P>
      <P>It is the second permanent housing project sponsored by the Buddhist Compassion
Relief Tzu Chi Foundation to open. The other, which opened in February, is in
Kaohsiung County's Shanlin Township.</P>
      <P>Presiding over the opening ceremony for the latest project, President Ma Ying-
jeou urged the public to applaud Tzu Chi for its efforts to help the victims.</P>
      <P>Ma expressed disagreement with criticism from certain quarters that Tzu Chi is
disturbing the life of the residents by organizing on-site visits to the Shanlin
community by "outsiders, " arguing that the visitors bring business
opportunities that are crucial to the livelihoods of the people living there.</P>
      <P>According to the president, post-disaster reconstruction involves not only the
rebuilding of homes but also the rebuilding of industries in the affected areas.</P>
      <P>He said the reconstruction in the aftermath of Typhoon Morakot has been highly
efficient, thanks mainly to the participation of the private sector. This
experience of public-private sector cooperation sets a model for future
reconstruction efforts, he added.</P>
      <P>The president later also inspected another community for Morakot victims that
was built by World Vision Taiwan in Pingtung County's Majia Township.</P>

      <P>Investigators in Chiayi City seized roughly 14,000 garments that carried "Made
in Taiwan" labels but were actually produced in China during a raid at a
warehouse in the southern city on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Acting on a tip-off, female investigators from the Chiayi City division of the
Bureau of Investigation working undercover as customers discovered that a hair
salon was selling a wide variety of Chinese-made clothing with the MIT label,
said Chang You-jen, deputy chief of the division.</P>
      <P>The investigators also found that the husband of the hair salon owner, surnamed
Chen, was the mastermind behind the operation, which led to the seizure of the
batch of fake products at a 6,610-square meter warehouse, according to Chang.</P>
      <P>Chen is suspected of importing low-cost Chinese apparel and asking workers to
remove "Made in China" labels and replace them with labels that read "Made in
Taiwan" in selling the clothing under the "Wuge" brand.</P>
      <P>The Chinese clothes cost roughly NT$100-NT$200 per item, but sold for twice to
three times as much when sold to distributors around the country as "Made in
Taiwan" products, Chang said.</P>
      <P>He added that Chen has used the scheme to sell 150,000 garments since 2006 and
has netted an estimated NT$20 million.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Philippines does not rule out free trade pact with Taiwan</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Philippine government will not rule out the possibility of negotiating a
free trade package with Taiwan, even though it only officially recognizes China
under its "one-China" policy, a senior Philippine trade official said Friday.</P>
      <P>After Singapore and Taiwan issued a joint statement Thursday that they would
explore  the feasibility  of a bilateral  economic cooperation pact, the
Philippines Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) Assistant Secretary Ramon
Vicente T. Kabigting contemplated a similar deal with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He said it would be ideal if the Philippines and Taiwan could forge closer
economic and trade ties as Taiwan is a major export market and an important
source of foreign investment, Kabigting told a Philippine TV station.</P>
      <P>Though the Philippines follows a "one-China" policy, it has always considered
Taiwan a major trade partner, Kabigting said, and he believed that a landmark
trade deal recently signed by Taiwan and China and Thursday's announcement
between Taiwan and Singapore would make it easier for the Philippines to follow
suit.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a local official, who declined to be identified, confirmed the same
day that economic and trade officials from the Philippines and Taiwan exchanged
views on signing a free trade agreement (FTA) , on the sidelines of the Asia-
Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Ministerial Meeting in Japan from Aug. 5-6.</P>
      <P>However, both the official and the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in the
Philippines refused to provide more details about the discussions.</P>
      <P>Before the new administration of President Benigno Aquino III took office on
June 30, economic authorities from the Philippines had already expressed an
interest in signing a trade deal with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Earlier this year, Jesli A. Lapus, the former DTI secretary, said that the
Philippine government  hopes to upgrade the existing memorandum of cooperation
on the Subic-Clark-Kaohsiung economic corridor, to a national-level FTA.</P>
      <P>According to the Central Bank of the Philippines, Taiwan is the 13th-largest
export market for the Philippines, accounting for about 3.5 percent of the
Philippines' total exports in 2009.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is also the Southeast Asian country's 13th-largest source of overseas
investment. Taiwanese businesses invested US$13.4 billion in the Philippines in
2009, central bank figures show.</P>

      <P>Smartphone maker HTC Corp. said Friday that it recorded its fourth consecutive
monthly sales record high in July on the back of strong global demand.</P>
      <P>In July, the company posted NT$24.61 billion (US$774 million) in sales, up 126.5
percent from a year earlier and also up 2.58 percent from the previous month.</P>
      <P>In the first seven months of this year, the company's sales totaled NT$123.52
billion, up 53.61 percent year-on-year.</P>
      <P>"Demand for smartphones  remains very robust on increasing replacements of
traditional cell phones, " Yuanta Securities analyst Bonnie Chang said.</P>
      <P>"HTC has to work very hard to satisfy its customers who are placing increasing
orders for its products, " Chang said, adding that "its efforts to build itself
up as a branded smartphone maker have paid off."</P>
      <P>Chang said the global penetration rate of smartphones is expected to rise to 20
percent in 2010 from about 15 percent in 2009, adding that "the penetration
level is still low, which means HTC has much room for growth."</P>
      <P>In an investor conference held a week earlier, HTC said it is planning to expand
production capacity at its plants in Taiwan's Taoyuan and China's Shanghai by
the end of this year.</P>
      <P>"Faced with rising orders, the company has no choice but to boost its production
capacity," Chang said.</P>
      <P>The monthly production capacity at its Taoyuan complex currently stands at 2
million units, while its Shanghai base is expected to produce 1 million units a
month by the end of the third quarter, with production capacity expected to rise
to over 3 million units in the fourth quarter.</P>
      <P>While HTC expects shipments for the third quarter to rise to 6.5 million units
from 5.4 million units in the second quarter, Chang said the estimate is too
conservative.</P>
      <P>She said HTC is resolving problems with panel shortages by using Sony's super
LCD (SLCD) to replace active matrix organic LED (AMOLED) which have been short
in supply.</P>
      <P>"The component supply is no longer a pressing problem for HTC... I expect
shipments in the third quarter to hit between 7.3 million and 7.5 million
units," Chang said.</P>
      <P>Chang said she recommends a buy on the stock with a 12 month target price of
NT$700, while Goldman Sachs has set a target price of as much as NT$800.</P>
      <P>HTC closed up 0.17 percent at NT$603.00 on the Taiwan Stock Exchange Friday.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's top official in charge of China affairs hailed Beijing Thursday for
respecting Taiwan's bid for an economic cooperation agreement with Singapore,
praising China's reaction as "pragmatic and reasonable."</P>
      <P>The gesture "should be recognized, " Lai Shin-yuan, chairwoman of the Mainland
Affairs Council (MAC), said at an informal meeting with Chinese-language media
in Washington D.C.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and Singapore announced early on Aug. 5 that they were seeking a trade
deal and that negotiations would start later this year.</P>
      <P>In a statement on China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs website the same day,
spokesman Jiang Yu said: "Our position has been consistent and unequivocal
regarding the economic exchanges and trade between Taiwan and foreign countries.
We hope relevant countries continue to abide by the one China principle and
handle relevant affairs prudently."</P>
      <P>China's Xinhua News Agency quoted officials from the Taiwan Affairs Office as
saying: "We believe Singapore will continue to abide by the one China policy and
handle its economic and trade ties with Taiwan based on that policy."</P>
      <P>In Washington, Lai also said that since Taiwan and China began
"institutionalized negotiations" more than two years ago, she has observed
Beijing is growing more aware of what Taiwanese people think.</P>
      <P>The two sides should put aside political disputes and continue efforts to
promote the positive development of cross-strait ties, she said.</P>
      <P>Lai's visit to the U.S. is her first since Taiwan signed a landmark economic
cooperation framework agreement with China in late June.</P>
      <P>Lai said that officials and scholars from think tanks she met in the U.S. all
touted the agreement as a positive development.</P>
      <P>Asked about the Chinese military's recent announcement that it would only
withdraw missiles targeting Taiwan under the "one China principle, " Lai said
there should be no political conditions on the issue at all.</P>
      <P>The situation "calls for action, not words," Lai said.</P>
      <P>Relations between Taiwan and China have improved dramatically since President Ma
Ying-jeou took power in 2008.</P>
      <P>In response to accusations that the Ma government is selling Taiwan's
sovereignty in exchange for the economic agreement, Lai said everyone could
check on the content of the agreement on the Internet and see for themselves
whether political deals were made.</P>
      <P>"There are none at all," she said.</P>

possible period of time, Minister of Economic Affairs Shih Yen-shiang said
Friday.</P>
      <P>Shih said he could not assure the media at the moment that the agreement talks
can be wrapped up in one year, however, because the deal will be a high-quality
one on par with a full-fledged FTA.</P>
      <P>He said the proposed Taiwan-Singapore accord will not just be a framework deal
like the economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) signed between Taiwan
and China in late June. Instead, it will be an FTA-like accord that can
accomplish the trade liberalization goal in one step, which will need much more
time to prepare and negotiate, Shih said.</P>
      <P>"As the agreement with Singapore will cover wide aspects and complete tariff
concessions and market opening in one step, it will take more time to conclude,"
Shih said.</P>
      <P>In contrast,  Taiwan and China need to conduct  follow-up negotiations on issues
regarding merchandise trade, service market access, investment and dispute-
resolving mechanisms within six months after the ECFA takes effect.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Shih promised that the Ministry of Economic Affairs will not let
the public down and will do its utmost to facilitate a speedy conclusion of the
Taiwan-Singapore deal.</P>
      <P>As to when negotiations will get under way, Shih said it has yet to be decided.</P>
      <P>"There should be some working  meetings  because  enormous preparatory work is
needed before formal talks can be launched," Shih said.</P>
      <P>MOEA sources said the ministry is contacting Singapore for a ministerial-level
meeting in the second half of the year.</P>
      <P>In what was seen a breakthrough for Taiwan after decades of being overshadowed
by China, the Taipei Representative Office in Singapore and the Singapore Trade
Office in Taipei issued a joint statement on Aug. 5 pledging to explore the
feasibility of a bilateral economic cooperation agreement.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Where Taiwan's major trading partners stand on FTAs</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>08/06/10  20:23:43</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A joint statement by Taiwan and Singapore Thursday that they have agreed to
explore the feasibility of an economic cooperation agreement represents a
breakthrough for Taiwan following its recent historic trade pact with China.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan government has said that the economic cooperation framework agreement
(ECFA) with China will prevent Taiwan from being marginalized in the Asia
Pacific region, where economic integration is taking place rapidly.</P>
      <P>The ECFA will also help to reduce cross-Taiwan Strait tensions and thus increase
Taiwan's chances of securing trade deals with its major trading partners, as
China will stop blocking the efforts in that direction, the government has said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is hoping that the Singapore initiative will be the first in a series of
trade liberalization  negotiations  with other countries.</P>
      <P>The level of success of Taiwan's efforts to forge other trade pacts will be seen
as a barometer of whether the ECFA is living up to expectations.</P>
      <P>The following are the positions of Taiwan's major trading partners on potential
bilateral trade deals: -- The United States</P>
      <P>The U.S. has said that a full-fledged FTA with Taiwan is not on the cards at
this time because it does not think Taiwan is fully prepared to open its market.
However, it supports Taiwan's right as a World Trade Organization (WTO) member
to sign FTAs with other members, the U.S. said.</P>
      <P>"The United States has no plans to begin talks with Taiwan about an FTA at this
time," said David Shear, a deputy assistant secretary of state, at the Carnegie
Endowment for International Peace.</P>
      <P>Raymond Burghardt, chairman of the American Institute in Taiwan, made a similar
statement at a round table meeting with the Taiwan press June 4.</P>
      <P>The U.S. intends to improve bilateral trade ties with Taiwan under the framework
of an existing Trade and Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA) and there is not
much enthusiasm in Washington for another FTA, he said.</P>
      <P>Both sides will try to use a "block-building" format that will rely on a series
of specific deals under the TIFA framework, such as a bilateral investment
agreement and an agreement on avoidance of double taxation, to enhance
cooperation, he said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and the U.S. have not held TIFA talks since 2007.</P>
      <P>-- The European Union</P>
      <P>The EU and Taiwan have been talking about the adoption of trade enhancement
measures (TEMs) rather than an FTA.</P>
      <P>Mauro Petriccione,  director  of the European  Commission's Directorate General
of Trade, said June 3 in Taipei that the EU member states will not give the
commission permission to negotiate trade deals with Taiwan " unless they have
some reasonable assurance that this will not damage our economic interests in
China."</P>
      <P>Petriccione also said China remained the key to whether the EU and Taiwan would
be able to sign TEMs. He added that the possibility of an FTA between Taiwan and
the EU at the moment is "very unclear."</P>
      <P>Taiwan's top envoy to the European Union and Belgium Y.L. Lin said Aug. 2 in
Brussels that the Taiwan government "has a high degree of willingness" to sign
an FTA with the EU but should first seek to remove trade barriers.</P>
      <P>The EU is Taiwan's fourth largest trading partner. In 2009, aggregate investment
in Taiwan by EU member states exceeded US$27.4 billion, making the EU Taiwan's
largest source of investment from abroad.</P>
      <P>-- Japan</P>
      <P>Japan,  Taiwan's second largest trading partner,  has been carefully evaluating
the impact of the ECFA and considering its strategy beyond that.</P>
      <P>Japan has said it would welcome closer economic relations with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Japanese officials have been quoted in the media as saying that it might be
necessary to promote an FTA among Japan, China and South Korea.</P>
      <P>Taiwan will liberalize its trade relations with Japan through a "block-building"
approach, starting with investment protection and intellectual property rights
protection, Nien Shinn-shyh, deputy secretary-general of the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs' Association of East Asian Relations, told reporters July 7.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for Japan's representative office in Taiwan, the Interchange
Association, confirmed Thursday that both sides had held discussions in Tokyo on
economic matters, including investment. However, no decision has been made on
bilateral cooperation, the office said.</P>
      <P>None of Japan's existing trade agreements with other countries are called free
trade agreements,  but rather Closer Economic Partnerships.</P>
      <P>-- The Philippines</P>
      <P>The position of Taiwan's closest neighbor to the south is not yet clear, as the
new Philippines government has only been in office since June.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan's proposal for an FTA with the Philippines will most likely be presented
at the next meeting of the Joint Economic Conference scheduled for around the
end of the year, " Antonio Basilio, managing director of the Manila Economic and
Cultural Office (MECO) in Taipei, said Thursday.</P>
      <P>He said the existing Subic-Clark EPZ/Taiwan EPZ Economic Corridor Agreement
could serve as a precursor to an FTA.</P>
      <P>The economic corridor is a project aimed at linking the economic zones of the
two countries to make the Philippines "Taiwan's entry point to the ASEAN
market." It seeks to take advantage of the fact that products processed in the
Philippines are regarded as ASEAN products and are thus allowed duty free entry
to other ASEAN member countries.</P>
      <P>Ramon Vicente T. Kabigting, the Philippines assistant secretary of Trade and
Industry, was quoted as saying Friday that while the Philippines' will stick
with the one-China policy, it will not rule out the possibility of an FTA with
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>-- Thailand</P>
      <P>Thailand, Taiwan's 12th-largest export market, is reportedly one of Taiwan's
priorities in its FTA efforts.</P>
      <P>Porpot Chagyawa, the head of the Economic Affairs Section of the Thailand Trade
and Economic Office in Taipei, said Aug. 2 that an FTA with Taiwan or any other
country is a matter that requires careful assessment, as its effects could be
significant.</P>
      <P>However, existing mechanisms have provided a substantial foundation for the
expansion of trade and investment between Thailand and Taiwan over the years, he
said.</P>
      <P>-- Malaysia</P>
      <P>Malaysia, one of Taiwan's top investment destinations in Southeast Asia,
reopened ministerial-level meetings with Taiwan on trade and economics on March
31 after a six-year hiatus.</P>
      <P>According to a comment in the media by a Taiwanese official, Malaysia has said
that the cross-strait ECFA "will facilitate the signing of an FTA between Taiwan
and Malaysia."</P>
      <P>-- Vietnam</P>
      <P>Taiwan is Vietnam's fifth largest trading partner. There has been no indication
of Vietnam's intention with regard to an FTA between the two countries.</P>
      <P>However, Huang Chih-peng, director-general of Taiwan's Bureau of Foreign Trade
and one of the main negotiators in Taiwan's ECFA talks with China, has been
designated as Taiwan's representative to Vietnam. By Chris Wang CNA Staff

      <P>The government must "properly" handle the suspension of the project to expand
the Central Taiwan Science Park because foreign investors are watching to see
how it resolves problems, the country's economic policy planner said Friday.</P>
      <P>Christina Liu, chairperson of the Council for Economic Planning and Development,
contended that if Taiwan wants to solicit foreign investors, it must do more
than make attractive offers.</P>
      <P>"What is most important is if foreign companies see investment barriers in
Taiwan, they will want to know how the country removes them," Liu said.</P>
      <P>Foreign investors only care whether the government will keep its promises, Liu
added while answering reporters' questions on a recent Taiwan High
Administrative Court ruling to suspend the park's expansion in Taichung and
Changhua counties because the environmental impact assessment report was
incomplete.</P>
      <P>Government  agencies involved in the park's expansion have decided, with the
support of Premier Wu Den-yih, to appeal the ruling made on Monday.</P>
      <P>Liu was also asked about Singapore's decision to study the feasibility of
forging a free trade-style agreement with Taiwan. If Taiwan were to eventually
sign such a deal, Liu said, she hoped it would encourage other countries to
reach similar pacts with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Liu also said she believes the countries  whose economies complement Taiwan's
will be the first to seek an economic cooperation agreement with Taiwan after
Singapore.</P>
      <P>Singapore is Taiwan's sixth-largest trading partner and its sixth-largest source
of foreign investment.</P>
      <P>Diplomatic officials have said that a Taiwan-Singapore trade pact would work
well for both countries because their economies are complementary rather than
competitive.</P>

      <P>The e-card reading devices on Mass Rapid Transit systems and buses in Taiwan
could be integrated as early as the end of the year, allowing passengers to
travel throughout the country with only one card, the Ministry of Transportation
and Communications (MOTC) said Friday.</P>
      <P>The ministry is planning to offer subsidies of NT$550 million (US$17.3 million)
to Taiwan's public transportation service operators to promote the installation
of integrated e-card readers, MOTC officials said.</P>
      <P>The ministry will subsidize 30 percent to 49 percent of the cost of the devices,
depending on the number of systems that the e-card readers recognize and the
time it takes bus companies to complete installation.</P>
      <P>For instance, if a bus company takes three months to complete installation of an
e-card reader that can read four different kinds of cards, it will receive a
subsidy of 49 percent of the cost.</P>
      <P>If it takes nine months to install readers that only recognize three kinds of
cards, the company will receive a subsidy of 30 percent.</P>
      <P>According to an earlier estimate,  a total of 22 million electronic cards have
been issued around the country, including 18 million EasyCards in Taipei, 1.3
million Smart Cards in central Taiwan, and 1 million prepaid cards each for
Kaohsiung's MRT and freeway.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Friday that Taiwan can become a global innovation
center where manufacturers can test products' popularity in Asia-Pacific
markets.</P>
      <P>Since the signing of the economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) with
China, Taiwan is in a better position to become a product testing market in the
region, the president said at the Presidential Office while meeting a group of
winners from local invention contests.</P>
      <P>He also  said  Taiwan  has  been  doing  well  in patent commercialization. "A
patent needs to be commercialized and pass a market test, and it is not just for
fun, " he said.</P>
      <P>Ma said that "innovative items, after being commercialized, can seek
preferential tariff treatment under the trade pact and be sold to China. Then we
will know how popular a product is in such a big market."</P>
      <P>While Taiwan needs to put efforts into innovation and R&amp;D in order to
succeed in international markets,  many international enterprises have set up
their R&amp;D or innovation departments in Taiwan recently, he said.</P>
      <P>Ma was meeting 20 award winners from this year's Taiwan's Edison Inventor Award
and the Outstanding Inventor Award.</P>
      <P>The president said that although Taiwan has limited natural resources for
development, the country has a lot of intellectual resources.</P>
      <P>He said that the government will continue to build up an economy in which
industries are able to expand their markets effectively.</P>

      <P>A Lithuanian student studying in Taiwan was arrested Wednesday by the Criminal

      <P>Maskvytis cashed two 500-euro American Express traveler's checks for NT$46,000
(US$1,484) on Jan. 14 and 15, the police said.</P>
      <P>The checks were cashed at Bank of Taiwan and Mega International Commercial Bank

      <P>Incumbent Tainan City Mayor Hsu Tain-tsair said Friday that he plans to announce
in mid-August whether he will defy his party and run in the Nov. 27 race for
mayor in the newly created Tainan special municipality.</P>
      <P>"I cannot tell you more about this now, but I will come out with a final
decision in mid-August, " Hsu said, declining to comment further.</P>
      <P>Liao Wen-chen, the head of the Houpi Township council in Tainan County, revealed
Hsu's possible bid Thursday night.</P>
      <P>Hsu could be the second member of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) to compete in one of five year-end mayoral elections as an independent
after failing to be nominated as the party's candidate.</P>
      <P>Earlier this week, Kaohsiung County Magistrate Yang Chiu-hsing of the DPP
announced  his bid to run in the Kaohsiung  special municipality (combining
Kaohsiung County and Kaohsiung City), pitting him against the party's official
nominee, Kaohsiung City Mayor Chen Chu, and a candidate from the ruling
Kuomintang (KMT).</P>
      <P>The candidates nominated by the DPP in its strongholds of Tainan and Kaohsiung
were expected to coast to victory, but the addition of DPP politicians running
as independents has raised fears that the pro-DPP support base could be split.</P>
      <P>The DPP's nominee in Tainan City is incumbent Legislator William Lai.</P>
      <P>DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen, who is the party's nominee in Taipei County (to be
called Xinbei City when it is upgraded to a special municipality) , has tried to
intervene to talk the rebel candidates out of running and avoid further splits
in the party that could affect other races the same day.</P>
      <P>She visited Yang in Kaohsiung Thursday night to try and get him to change his
mind but was unsuccessful. Yang said he will announce his mayoral bid on Aug. 8
and will pull out of the DPP once he registers his candidacy with the Central
Election Commission.</P>
      <P>Residents of Taipei City, Xinbei City and the new Taichung, Tainan and Kaohsiung
special municipalities will all select new mayors in November.</P>
      <P>Because the eligible voters in these five districts represent roughly 60 percent

      <P>A dispute between Taiwan and China over how to divide up an increase in cross-
Taiwan Strait flights has been resolved, and carriers will be able to operate
more flights as originally agreed, a senior aviation official said Friday.</P>
      <P>"The gap in perceptions of the agreement reached in May on the number of
additional flights carriers from each side will be allowed to operate has been
bridged, " said Yin Cheng-peng, director-general of the Civil Aeronautics
Administration (CAA).</P>
      <P>"If all goes well, new flights will take off by the end of this month, " said
Yin, who was not part of the team of Taiwanese negotiators that reached an
agreement with their Chinese counterparts in Xiamen Friday morning and then
returned home.</P>
      <P>The team traveled to the southeastern Chinese city Thursday to seek a solution
to the dispute involving both the number of increased flights and the
destinations those flights could serve.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese and Chinese officials had agreed in May to allow carriers from each
side to fly 50 additional nonstop cross-strait flights per week, starting in
June, to meet growing market demand.</P>
      <P>As part of the deal, carriers from each country have been operating 14 new
weekly flights between Taipei's Songshan Airport and Shanghai's Hongqiao Airport
since mid-June, without any problem.</P>
      <P>But China rejected most of the other applications by Taiwanese carriers for new
flight routes because the arrangement would not have met Beijing's requirement
that 20 of the 50 new flights serve Xiamen or Fuzhou.</P>
      <P>The two cities are adjacent to the Haixi special economic zone, one of the areas
that China has prioritized for development.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese officials, however, have said the May agreement did not require Taiwan
carriers to operate any additional flights to the two Chinese cities since the
airlines were already running a total of 22 weekly flights to those destinations
as part of their original quota of 135 flights per week.</P>
      <P>After China rejected the Taiwanese carriers' applications, Taiwan retaliated by
ordering Chinese carriers to suspend 31 of their 36 newly approved cross-strait
flights with effect from Aug. 1, and the other five flights from Oct. 30.</P>
      <P>With the dispute disrupting the plans of Taiwanese and Chinese carriers, China
agreed to reopen talks on the issue.</P>
      <P>As Friday's talks were fruitful, Yin said, carriers from the two sides can renew
their applications next week to operate new flights.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Friday that the reason Taiwan wants to purchase
high-performance combat aircraft from the United States is to maintain its self-
defense capability.</P>
      <P>"Not only does the United States understand that, we know it, and we hope
mainland China understands it too,  " Ma said in a Presidential  Office meeting
with visitors from the Washington D.C.-based Center for Strategic and
International Studies (CSIS) think tank.</P>
      <P>The guests included retired U.S. Navy Admiral Timothy Keating, as well as
experts in cross-Taiwan Strait affairs Bonnie Glaser and Alan Romberg.</P>
      <P>Ma noted that amid improving cross-strait ties, there are more than 1,000
missiles deployed on the mainland targeting Taiwan.</P>
      <P>This "worries" Taiwan, he said, adding that he hopes Taiwan and the U.S. not
only maintain their security ties, but strengthen the links.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's request to buy high-performance combat aircraft such as F-16C/Ds is not
to enhance its offensive capability but to replace older fighters, allowing the
country's fleet to continue to be capable of defending Taiwan, Ma said.</P>
      <P>"We will not ask Americans to fight a war for Taiwan" because Taiwan is
determined to defend itself, Ma said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is also confident that the tension in the strait will continue to
decrease, Ma said, adding that he believes that as outlined in the Taiwan
Relations Act, Washington will firmly keep its promise in terms of arm sales. He
called the U.S. promise "very crucial" for continued peace in the strait and
stability in the East Asian region.</P>
      <P>Ma also talked about the economic cooperation framework agreement Taiwan signed
with China in late June.</P>
      <P>He said the trade pact has helped improve cross-strait relations and at the same
time encouraged Taiwan's other major trade partners to seek deals that are
similar to free trade agreements with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and China spent over six months in talks and negotiations on the economic
agreement, Ma said. Thanks to the talks, the two sides had deeper and more
comprehensive contacts with each other than before.</P>
      <P>"Basically, they were a kind of confidence-building measure," he told the
American visitors, who are involved in the think tank's program on cross-strait
confidence-building measures.</P>

      <P>More than 600 indigenous people from southern Taiwan who were affected by
Typhoon Morakot a year ago arrived in Taipei Friday and planned to spend the
night at Ketagalan Boulevard in front of the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>Coming from Taitung, Kaohsiung, Pingtung and Chiayi counties, the Paiwan, Rukai,
Bunun and Tsou tribe members accused the government of forcefully relocating
them and refusing to let them take part in reconstruction policy-making. They
were joined by around 300 supporters.</P>
      <P>The Indigenous Peoples Action Coalition, which organized the rally, said that
there were no political factors behind the rally. A coalition official said that
since Morakot devastated southern Taiwan on Aug. 8, 2009, they had accumulated
so much anger and exasperation that they could not tolerate it any longer.</P>
      <P>The rally began at 8 p.m. with all participants paying their respects to people
who died in the disaster, with four pastors from the tribes leading them in
prayer in their own languages.</P>
      <P>Pastor Luma from the Bunun tribe was in tears as he said that the bodies of many
brothers and sisters still had not been found and that those still living have
not seen the reconstruction they hoped for.</P>
      <P>The group also read a statement calling for the government to stop choosing
replacement housing units over reconstructing their homes, to cancel time limits
on forced relocation, and to give the group a part in decision-making processes
concerning resettlement and the confirmation of safe lands.</P>
      <P>A coalition official said that the government should not just provide  a "single
option."  Reconstruction  work should cover environmental, industrial, public
facility, and confidence-building reconstruction, he said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>China's defense ministry said recently that the removal of missiles and miliary
deployments  targeting  Taiwan will be a negotiable issue under the "One China"
principle. Taiwan later responded by urging Beijing to remove the missiles,
based on the "1992 consensus" -- which means agreeing to disagree on what "one
China" means.</P>
      <P>The differences between the sides lie in the content of "one China." Therefore,
redefining "one China" is an issue that Beijing needs to deal with seriously.</P>
      <P>Beijing must realize that the so-called "Taiwan issue" is one concerning the
status of the Republic of China on Taiwan. The main problem here is that Beijing
has been denying the ROC and trying to eradicate the ROC.</P>
      <P>In this case, applying a "rooftop theory" that defines "one China" as a "third
concept" can provide a resolution. This is our suggestion: "There is only one
China in the world. Both the Republic of China and the People's Republic of
China are parts of China. China's sovereignty and territory must not be
separated." (Editorial abstract -- Aug. 7, 2010)</P>

(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Following the signing of an economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA)
between Taiwan and China, political issues such as setting up a military
confidence-building mechanism and removing missiles targeting Taiwan have
suddenly heated up across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>This raises concerns that the progress of subsequent trade talks could be
interrupted.</P>
      <P>As shown from past experience, the principle of "doing things right rather than
doing them in a hurry" should apply to the development of cross-strait
relations. By putting aside political differences, Taiwan and China have allowed
a prosperous economic and trade network to be created across the strait.</P>
      <P>The most urgent job at present is for the two sides to seek to enhance their
economic and trade ties and establish a complementary and mutually-beneficial
relationship.</P>
      <P>The conclusion of the ECFA is only a beginning. It would not be proper for them
to get distracted by political issues. (Editorial abstract -- Aug. 7, 2010)</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's popular coffee chain "85J Cafe" is expected to launch its primary
listing on the Taiwan Stock Exchange in November at the earliest, underwriter
Yuanta Securities said Friday.</P>
      <P>The chain's owner - Cayman Islands-registered Gourmet Master Co., Ltd., operates
the coffee shops in Taiwan, China, Australia and the United States, providing
coffee, tea, cakes and bread.</P>
      <P>Since the first cafe was opened in 2005 in central Taiwan's Taichung City, the
chain has steadily grown in popularity. It later became known for its innovative
salted coffee.</P>
      <P>Gourmet Master has obtained a greenlight from a reviewing committee of the
Taiwan Stock Exchange for the share offering, Yuanta Securities said.</P>
      <P>According to its prospectus, Gourmet Master is planning to issue 14.25 million
new shares for the stock offering, while 10 percent of the shares will be
reserved for its employees for subscription.</P>
      <P>Gourmet Master, which is capitalized at NT$1.14 billion (US$35.93 million),
posted NT$758 million in net profit in 2009, up about 130 percent from 2008. Its
earnings per share (EPS) in 2009 hit NT$11.25, compared with NT$7.97 recorded a
year earlier.</P>
      <P>In the first quarter of this year, the company's net profit reached NT$193
million, with EPS at NT$2.75.</P>
      <P>The underwriter said Gourmet Master's gross margin in 2009 exceeded 50 percent.</P>
      <P>According to Yuanta Securities, Gourmet Master's bottom line has been boosted by
rapidly growing demand in the China market after the company extended its
foothold to the mainland from Taiwan in 2007.</P>
      <P>Currently, Taiwan accounts for about 52 percent of Gourmet Master's total
revenue, while China makes up some 40 percent.</P>
      <P>In May, U.S. based integrated circuit designer Integrated Memory Logic Ltd. was
listed on the Taiwan Stock Exchange, making it the first and only foreign
company to make a primary listing on the mainboard.</P>
      <P>According to the exchange, more than 50 foreign companies have expressed
interest in making primary listings in Taiwan after years of efforts by the
government to woo overseas Taiwan investors and foreign entities to use the
island as a fund raising site in an attempt to boost its international
visibility.</P>

      <P>In the wake of a recent string of environmental controversies involving several
industrial parks, a group of academics launched a petition drive asking the
government to scrap the planned Kuokuang Petrochemical Park project. The group
also urged the government to seek to steer Taiwan's industries toward the goals
of "low pollution, low energy consumption and low health risk."</P>
      <P>The government needs to adopt a more farsighted perspective when mapping out its
economic and environmental policies and should not delay in implementing them.</P>
      <P>It is possible to find a principle that balances industrial development and
environmental protection, but whether it involves internalizing the cost of
externalities (such as pollution) , elevating efficiency requirements, or
carrying out pollution quotas, the government must ensure consistent
implementation of its policies to prevent conflicts. (Editorial abstract -- Aug.

    <HEADLINE>Talk of the day -- Mailiao residents' health found worse</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>08/07/10  15:40:21
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Fires that hit a giant refinery and petrochemical complex in Mailiao of central
Taiwan's Yunlin County in the hot summer month of July have alerted residents in
the coastal township that they might not just be the victim of toxic ash left by
the blazes, but also of long-term air pollution.</P>
      <P>A research team, headed by professor Chan Chang-chuan at National Taiwan
University's Institute of Occupational Medicine and Industrial Hygiene,  found
after a one-year  study and survey  that the concentration of carcinogenic
particulate matters in the air above Mialiao and several other townships close
to the privately-run petrochemical complex was higher than the comparative group
of townships.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from the local media coverage on Aug. 7 of the topic:</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>The report, released Aug. 6, found that among 250 raw materials and relevant by-
products used at the Mailiao refinery and petrochemical complex operated by the
Formosa Plastics Group, researchers discovered 132 kinds of pollutants or
carcinogenic substances.</P>
      <P>Chan pointed out that when the wind blows from the right direction, the
researchers would detect a high concentration of particulate matters. The
results proved the petrochemical industry is indeed a sector that causes high
pollution, he said.</P>
      <P>According to the report, the concentration of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen
dioxide detected in the Taisi township that lies next to Mailiao had been lower
than that in Lunbei in the comparative group before the establishment of the
petrochemical complex that began operation in 1999.</P>
      <P>However, in 2000, the concentration of sulfur dioxide detected had grown 4.1
times and that of nitrogen dioxide increased 1.4 times.</P>
      <P>When the wind blows from the plants toward the exposed areas, the concentration
of 10 kinds of heavy metal substances, including strontium and manganse, was
higher than the comparative group. The level of particulate matters was also
found higher than the maximum limit set by the World Health Organization for
human health, the report said.</P>
      <P>Chan stressed that although the study has proven there is air pollution in the
townships surrounding the Formosa petrochemical complex,  while discovering  the
metabolic product OHP of the carcinogenic chemical, polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons (PAHs) , in the body of the residents of the townships, researchers
still need 10 more years to find out whether the pollution is the culprit of a
high death rate from cancer among the locals.</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>The Yunlin County Bureau of Health tasked Chan and professor Lee Yung-ling at
National Taiwan University's Institute of Preventive Medicine in 2009 to conduct
the study and survey on the petrochemical complex's impact on the health of
local people, after it found a high rate of cancer-caused deaths among the
locals.</P>
      <P>The bureau pointed out that in 2002, 227 out of 100,0000 people living in the
coastal areas in Yunlin died of cancer. In 2007, the number increased to 264,
which was higher than the average 176 in the whole Taiwan area.</P>
      <P>Chan said his team engaged in surveys on residents aged above 6 in Mailiao,
Taisi, Baojhong, Sihhu, Dongshih, Lunbei, Huwei townships in the past year. They
collected 2006 valid questionnaires.</P>
      <P>The team found that the lung function of Mailiao and Taisi residents was weaker
than that of people living in Dongshih and Huwei that are situated farther away
from the petrochemical complex.</P>
      <P>The PAHs concentration in the urine samples of Mailiao and Taisi residents were
higher than those of residents from Huwei, the research team said, suggesting a
continuous study to confirm the air pollution's impact on residents' health.</P>
      <P>Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>Chan said although the research results could still not prove the petrochemical
complex in the coastal area of Yunlin County is the culprit of a high cancer-
caused death rate among coastal residents, the researchers did discover
petrochemical carcinogenic substances in the body of the locals.</P>
      <P>They have proven there are links between the pollution and human health. Such a
result "amazes and worries" him, Chan said, urging the government to do
something for the coastal residents.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Environmental Protection Administration said it will invite
more experts for a meeting on Aug. 12 to discuss the report.</P>
      <P>Formosa Petrochemical Co. said it was the first time that the company learned
such information about pollution from their plants. They will not make any
comments until they look into the matter, officials of the company said. (Aug.

      <P>A technology committee led by Hwang Jung-chiou, vice minister of economic
affairs, is scheduled to meet next week to discuss the AUO application, the
sources said.</P>
      <P>The MOEA has asked the 10 members of the technology committee -- most of them
from academia -- to show up next week for the scheduled meeting, the sources
said.</P>
      <P>The review of the application comes at a sensitive time for the company and its
investment plans.</P>
      <P>AUO had planned to invest an estimated NT$400 billion (US$12.61 billion)  in two
11th-generation  flat panel plants and solar energy-related facilities in Erlin,
Changhua County, the site of the fourth-phase expansion of the Central Taiwan
Science Park.</P>
      <P>The company has also started work on one of two planned 8.5-generation
facilities in Houli, Taichung County, where the science park's third-phase
expansion is taking place.</P>
      <P>But AUO's local investment plans were left in limbo this past week after the
Taiwan High Administrative Court suspended the science park's two expansion
projects because park authorities had failed to present a reliable environmental
impact assessment of the Houli and Erlin projects.</P>
      <P>Despite the legal setback, however, the Science Park on Thursday approved AUO's
change plan to build the two 11th-generation plants in Erlin rather than four
10th-generation plants as originally planned, confirming the company's
commitment to use Taiwan as a hub for its long-term investment.</P>
      <P>Such a commitment is a prerequisite for investing in China, and cleared the way
for the MOEA's upcoming review of AUO's plans to pour US$3 billion into a
7.5-generation plant in Kunshan in China's Jiangsu province.</P>
      <P>Hwang said earlier in the week that the review of AUO's China investment
application would not be affected by the suspension of the science park's
expansion plans as the environmental impact assessment cited by the court was
unrelated to the investor.</P>
      <P>The sources said the ministry has asked AUO for more information on the
adjustments in its Erlin investment plan and the upcoming committee meeting is
expected to review information provided by the flat panel maker.</P>
      <P>In February, the government relaxed restrictions to allow local flat panel
makers to build up to three 6th-generation or more advanced plants in China, but
applicants were required to preserve their technology lead over China and
promise further investment in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>AUO filed the Kunshan investment application with the MOEA in March, while also
submitting its NT$400 billion Erlin investment proposal to show its
determination to pursue long-term development in Taiwan.</P>

      <P>An annual long-distance swimming competition was held at Liaolou Bay in Kinmen
on Saturday with more than 1,700 swimmers participating, the highest number in
the event's eight-year history.</P>
      <P>A total of 1,772 swimmers, comprising 85 teams, with 71 from Taiwan, 12 from
China, one from Hong Kong and one from Macau for the first time ever, took part
in the 3,000-meter swim held by the Kinmen County government.</P>
      <P>Sports Affairs Council Minister Tai Hsia-ling and Kinmen County Magistrate Li
Wo-shih attended the opening ceremony of the event. Tai promised that she will
join the swimmers in the beautiful bay next year.</P>
      <P>Many of the swimmers this year had taken part in the event before. Chang Kin-nan
and Chang Huang Hsiu-jong, a couple from Hsinchu with a combined age of 130,
swam in the race for the fifth time this year.</P>
      <P>"The place is beautiful, the water quality is great, and the people here are
very friendly. That's why we come here again and again," they said.</P>
      <P>Saturday's event was to be followed by another big swim featuring the outlying
Taiwan-held county on Sunday -- the 2010 swim between Kinmen and the Chinese
city of Xiamen.</P>
      <P>Swimmers are scheduled to set out from Shuangkou on the island of Little Kinmen
and swim seven kilometers to Yefengzhai in Xiamen on China's coast.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Notebook computer maker Inventec Corp. said Saturday its July sales fell 5.4
percent from June largely because of weakening demand from Europe.</P>
      <P>Inventec posted sales of NT$32.86 billion (US$1.04 billion) in July, down from
the NT$34.73 billion in sales recorded in June. The July figure was also down
11.77 percent from a year earlier.</P>
      <P>For the first seven months of the year, the company totaled NT$200.75 billion in
sales, down 10.53 percent year-on-year.</P>
      <P>Hsu Hsin-chun, the company's senior vice president, said the decline has been
expected.</P>
      <P>Apart from the lingering impact of debt problems in the eurozone, Hsu said
demand in Europe also turned weak due to the ongoing summer vacation  and
because many shipments  to meet demand for the back-to-school season in
September were shipped in June.</P>
      <P>He said that while demand from Europe fell and demand in the U.S. was flat, the
company enjoyed growth in the China market, but he characterized the global
market as "unstable."</P>
      <P>Hsu still expected the third quarter, traditionally the peak season for the
global high tech sector, to be stronger than the second quarter, but said it was
too early to predict the level of growth.</P>
      <P>He said the effect of the peak season is unlikely to be felt until September
after the summer vacation ends.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A Taiwanese American producer said Saturday that he hopes his film featuring
Taiwan's bloody past under authoritarian rule decades ago will get people to
start talking about the issues related to that period.</P>
      <P>"I think for a lot of Taiwanese, these issues are not really discussed, " Will
Tiao said at a gathering with foreign reporters in Taipei, two days after the
award-winning film Formosa Betrayed had its box office opening in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"You don't talk about these issues whether because you are afraid of an insider
argument. Or maybe your parents, they will torture you about this," he said.</P>
      <P>"I think the movie makes you talk about these issues. And I hope in a way, that
gets people out of what I call the blue-green dialectic."</P>
      <P>Taiwan's political environment is dominated by the divide between "pan-green"
supporters  backing Taiwan centrism and "pan-blue" supporters more open to
developing closer ties with China.</P>
      <P>Tiao said, however, that the movie is neither green nor blue. He previously told
local media that he raised nearly NT$300 million (US$9.5 million) from 300
investors, including pan-blue and pan-green supporters, to make Hollywood's
first film on Taiwanese activists who were killed for promoting democracy in the
country in the 1980s.</P>
      <P>"My job is to hit the middle, " he said on Saturday. "We are telling this in an
American way, from an outside perspective about what happened at that time."</P>
      <P>More than NT$1.5 million in advanced sale tickets have been sold so far in
Taiwan as many people are buying out screenings, according to the producer.</P>
      <P>Tiao's parents moved from Taiwan to the United States before he was born. His
parents supported the democracy campaign in Taiwan, and his father was put on a
blacklist by the Taiwanese government back then as a result.</P>
      <P>Tiao worked for the U.S. government, but he decided in 2002 to pursue an acting
career in Hollywood.</P>
      <P>Asked if the younger generation in Taiwan is interested in seeing the film,
Tiao, who also contributed to the film's script and acted in the movie, said
young people were also fascinated by Formosa Betrayed.</P>
      <P>"The stereotype is that they are not interested, they are not concerned. This is
what they feel is their parents' struggle. It's not their struggle," he said.</P>
      <P>"But you will be surprised. I mean, the reactions have been really, really good,
really strong. People are fascinated."</P>
      <P>The most frequently asked question he has gotten in Taiwan is whether he will do
another movie about Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"It all depends on how we do here," he said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Saturday that a recently concluded trade deal with
China will increase output by NT$111.1  billion and create 34,009 jobs in the
five special municipalities where mayoral elections will be held later this
year.</P>
      <P>Ma, who doubles as the chairman of the ruling Kuomintang, called on his party's
candidates to talk up the benefits of the economic cooperation framework
agreement (ECFA) during the run-up to the Nov. 27 elections in Taipei, Xinbei,
Taichung, Tainan and Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>"We want to tell the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) to stop opposing the
ECFA or they will become the enemy of the people, " Ma said while addressing a
provisional meeting of the KMT National Congress.</P>
      <P>According to Ma, the establishment of the ECFA has helped ease cross-Taiwan
Strait tensions and improved Taiwan's relations with foreign countries.</P>
      <P>The recent progress in Taiwan's effort to seek a trade agreement with Singapore
also has allowed Taiwan to feel China's pragmatic attitude and goodwill, he
said.</P>
      <P>Besides cross-strait peace and prosperity, Ma said, the KMT administration has
also chalked up many other achievements over the past two years, including
fighting corruption, revitalizing the economy, restructuring the government,
reforming the education and welfare system and expanding Taiwan's international
participation.</P>
      <P>Ma said his administration is determined to wipe out corruption to distinguish
itself from the former DPP administration, which he described as a period of
"unprecedented" corruption that saw the first family and many Cabinet officials
implicated in corruption cases.</P>
      <P>He further pointed to the DPP's decision to scrap the Fourth Nuclear Power Plant
in 2000, which sent the stock index plummeting by 4,000 points, as an example of
the DPP's mismanaging the country's economy.</P>
      <P>Even with such a poor record, many politicians who served in the former DPP
government are now running in the year-end elections, he noted, obviously
referring to former Premier Su Tseng-chang, former Vice Premier Tsai Ing-wen,
and former Council of Labor Affairs Chen Chu.</P>
      <P>"With all the things they did to harm the country over the previous eight years,
I don't think they deserve the people's trust," Ma said.</P>

      <P>There were 68,746 marriages in Taiwan in the first six months of the year, about
11 percent more than during the same period last year, the Ministry of the
Interior (MOI) said Saturday.</P>
      <P>The MOI said the number of marriages between two Taiwanese citizens rose 7,322,
or 14 percent, in the first half of 2010, while the number of marriages
involving one Taiwanese and one foreign national was 497, or 4.5 percent, lower
than during the same period last year.</P>
      <P>The cross-border marriages -- 10,460 in the first six months -- accounted for
about 15 percent of overall marriages, down 2.5 percentage points from the same
period last year.</P>
      <P>The incidence of such marriages hit a peak of 32 percent in 2003.</P>
      <P>Of the cross-border marriages, about 63 percent involved spouses from China
(including Hong Kong and Macau).</P>
      <P>Just over 70 percent of the foreign brides (72.5 percent) were from China, while
15 percent were from Vietnam. Among foreign grooms, 21 percent were also from
China, while 18.4 percent were from Japan and 18.2 percent from the United
States.</P>
      <P>The ministry said that due to the global economic recession and the impact of
"guluan" year last year, only 117,099 couples were married in 2009, the lowest
number in history.</P>
      <P>People traditionally believe that couples married during a "guluan" year -- or
"widow" year -- will have an unhappy marriage.</P>
      <P>Over the past six years, the number of marriages have ranged between 110,000 and
150,000 annually.</P>

      <P>The "InvesTaiwan Service Center, " a new Cabinet-level agency created to attract
foreign investors and promote Taiwan as a good place for foreign investments,
will begin operating Sunday.</P>
      <P>Economic Affairs Minister Shih Yen-shiang will head the service center,  while
Yen Chung-kuang, deputy director of the MOEA's Department of Investment Service,
will serve as its chief executive officer, the Ministry of Economic Affairs
(MOEA) said Saturday.</P>
      <P>About 20 officials from the government will work for the service center
initially, but the workforce is expected to eventually expand to 30 to broaden
the scale of services, the ministry said.</P>
      <P>The service center's main responsibility will be to provide a single window
through which potential foreign investors can obtain any assistance or services
needed to make a decision on investing in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Under the set-up, government agencies, including the MOEA, the Council for
Economic Planning and Development, the Ministry of Transportation and
Communications, and the Department of Health, will continue to search for
potential targets and then hand them off to the service center for follow-up
assistance.</P>
      <P>Because some of the consulting to be done by the service center will involve
technology issues, some research institutes, including the Industrial Technology
Research Institute and Institute for Information Industry, have sent
representatives to the service center.</P>
      <P>For its part, the MOEA has targeted six potential foreign investors,  mostly
from the information technology and biotech sectors, sources said.</P>

      <P>Indigenous people left homeless by Typhoon Morakot said Saturday after an
overnight protest in Taipei that they have decided to file a complaint with the
United Nations against President Ma Ying-jeou for not respecting the rights of
aborigines.</P>
      <P>They were "disappointed" at the government's response to their call for the
right to decide how the work should be done to rebuild their homes, said Oto
Micyang, who is in charge of liaison affairs for the Indigenous Peoples Action
Coalition that organized the rally.</P>
      <P>Over 600 indigenous people from the Tsou tribe in Chiayi County, the Bunun in
Kaohsiung County, the Pingpu from Kaohsiung's Siaolin village, and the Paiwan
and Rukai in Taitung and Pingtung counties joined the rally to protest against
forced resettlement.</P>
      <P>They appealed to the Ma government to stop forcing them to move into so-called
"permanent houses" that have been built outside their homelands and constructed
in a way that does not reflect traditional aboriginal lifestyles and culture,
Micyang said.</P>
      <P>Although the government has argued it has never forced people displaced by
Typhoon Morakot to move into new settlements, Micyang contended that the
administration has never offered any other options.</P>
      <P>"When tribal veterans selected a safe place for their new settlement, some
government officials would just call it unsafe without offering scientific
evidence, " he complained in an interview with the Central News Agency.</P>
      <P>Liu Hsing-chien, the chief executive of the Cinhe village rehabilitation
association in Kaohsiung County, said rehabilitation should be done step by
step.</P>
      <P>The government, however, was so eager to permanently settle the victims who
lived in Taiwan's mountains that it failed to see their needs and respect their
different lifestyles and cultures.</P>
      <P>"Once aborigines agree to move down to plains areas, the mountainous lands that
were once their homes will be categorized as a 'special zone' where they can no
longer build houses, " Liu told the Chinese-language daily United Evening News.</P>
      <P>"What if they cannot get acclimated to life in plains areas? Will they still be
able to return to their homeland in the mountains?" Liu asked.</P>
      <P>Micyang said they have launched a petition drive, and once they have collected
enough signatures they will file a complaint with U.N.-affiliated  organizations
advocating human rights and the interests of indigenous peoples.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Executive Yuan's commission formed to handle post-Typhoon Morakot
reconstruction said Saturday it "completely appreciates and understands" the
aborigines' complaints, and answered protesters complaints that some of the
reconstruction work was proceeding too slowly by promising to expedite the
process.</P>
      <P>A commission statement said Chen Chen-chuan, the deputy chief of the commission,
Council of Indigenous Peoples Vice Minister Hsia Chin-lung and Vice Interior
Minister Lin Tsyr-ling, met earlier in the day to review existing reconstruction
measures.</P>
      <P>Typhoon Morakot attacked southern Taiwan last August, triggering massive
flooding and landslides that left more than 700 people dead or missing.</P>

      <P>Taiwan is eyeing Vietnam and Indonesia as potential free trade agreement (FTA)
partners after announcing earlier this week that it had agreed with Singapore to
explore the feasibility of a free trade deal, the Ministry of Economic Affairs
(MOEA) said Saturday.</P>
      <P>The MOEA said the government is eyeing many potential FTA targets, with the
signing of FTAs with Vietnam and Indonesia as the top priorities.</P>
      <P>After Taiwan and China signed an economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA)
in June, Taiwan has begun preparations to sign other bilateral trade agreements
with major trading partners to knock down trade barriers, cut tariffs and expand
commercial exchanges.</P>
      <P>The Presidential Office said earlier this week that President Ma Ying-jeou was
pleased with the work of the Cabinet in opening talks with Singapore after the
signing of the ECFA.</P>
      <P>A trade deal with Singapore is expected to serve as a foundation from which
Taiwan can build closer commercial ties with other trading partners, the
Presidential Office said.</P>
      <P>Minister of Economic Affairs Shih Yen-shiang said Taiwan is pursuing a "high
quality" trade agreement with Singapore, and indicated that the agreement is
expected to "accomplish its goal in one step."</P>
      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party said, however, that even if Taiwan
and Singapore sign a trade deal, the island is unlikely to enjoy substantial
benefits since about 99 percent of its top 100 products sold to the city state
are given tariff-free treatment, citing trade figures in 2006.</P>
      <P>The MOEA countered by arguing that negotiations with Singapore will focus on the
service sector, and that the two countries are also expected to talk about
investment, agricultural cooperation and joint efforts to penetrate the regional
market.</P>
      <P>The ministry said that as long as the trade deal with Singapore is done, other
trading partners could be more willing to ink similar trade agreements with
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In 2009, Singapore accounted for 4.23 percent of Taiwan's total exports, while
Vietnam took 2.94 percent and Indonesia made up 1.58 percent.</P>

      <P>World Vision Taiwan's annual 30-Hour Famine campaign kicked off Saturday and was
expected to draw more than 15,000 people ready to fast and participate in
community services.</P>
      <P>This year's 30-Hour Famine Hero Rally, which began at noon and runs until 6 p.m.
Sunday, differs from previous rallies in that every participant must spend at
least two hours volunteering in activities devoted to Taiwan's social and living
environment.</P>
      <P>The activities, organized by World Vision, include promoting the event,
cleaning streets, communities or beaches, helping with recycling, or raising
funds. Participants were also allowed to engage in volunteer activities of their
own design.</P>
      <P>With Sunday marking the one-year anniversary of Typhoon Morakot, World Vision
Taiwan Director Hank Du asked the public to show their concern and support for
those displaced by the typhoon and efforts to rebuild southern Taiwan, which was
devastated by the storm.</P>
      <P>This year's anti-hunger campaign will culminate with a rally at Linkou Gymnasium
in Taipei County on Sunday. Participants are required to present a DIY Famine
Certificate and Community Service Certificate to gain entry.</P>
      <P>This year also marks the first time that the campaign, which has been held in
Taiwan since 1990, kicked off simultaneously in seven places around the country
-- in Taipei and Hsinchu counties and the cities of Taipei, Taichung, Chiayi,
Kaohsiung and Yilan, World Taiwan said.</P>
      <P>According to the campaign's official website, the annual event, has also drawn
interest from more than 60,000 people and 500 groups who registered for the
charity's "DIY Famine" program,  which encourages them to fast for 30 hours, at
their own convenience, to experience what is like to be hungry.</P>
      <P>An official at World Vision Taiwan said in late July that the organization hopes
this year's campaign will raise NT$172 million (US$5.4 million).</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou, in a break from his usually moderate image, attacked the
opposition party Saturday in a bid to drum up support for the ruling party's
candidates in the five special municipalities where mayoral elections will be
held later this year.</P>
      <P>The president, who doubles as the chairman of the ruling Kuomintang (KMT),
touted his government's achievements, including the reduction of cross-strait
tensions and the economic benefits of a trade deal with China, while addressing
a provisional meeting of the party's national congress.</P>
      <P>But he also lashed out at what he described as the "closed-door" policy of the
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) administration when it was in power from
2000-2008, saying that it had "seriously impeded" the nation's development while
other nations had progressed rapidly.</P>
      <P>KMT ranking officials said the toughening of Ma's tone reflected the party's
strategy after an internal discussion.</P>
      <P>Ma, without directly naming DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen and former Premier Su
Tseng-chang, who are running for office in Xinbei City and Taipei City
respectively, said that officials under the DPP administration had "done many
harmful things to the nation over the past eight years."</P>
      <P>On the issue of ECFA, over which the two parties are bitterly divided, Ma warned
the DPP that "if you are against the ECFA, you are making yourself the enemy of
the people."</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Lin Hung-chih said Ma wants to underscore the differences of the
two parties in cross-strait ties, and diplomatic and economic policies.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan was plunged into diplomatic and political difficulties under the DPP

    <HEADLINE>Working holiday program draws Taiwanese abroad, but few into Taiwan</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's youths have shown considerable enthusiasm in going abroad on working
holiday programs, but interest among foreign youths in visiting Taiwan under the
program has been limited because of major obstacles encountered here.</P>
      <P>Over 10,000 Taiwanese youths head overseas every year on working holidays in
four nations, but only 318 young adults have come to Taiwan on a working holiday
over the past six years, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA).</P>
      <P>Taiwan has signed working holiday agreements with four countries -- New Zealand,
Australia, Japan and Canada -- in June 2004, November 2004, June 2009 and July
2010 respectively.</P>
      <P>Among the four countries, New Zealand offers 600 openings and Japan 2,000
openings to Taiwanese nationals every year.</P>
      <P>Australia has set no quota, while Canada increased its openings from 200 in the
beginning to 700 at present for those aged 18-35, with less stringent
conditions.</P>
      <P>Hoping that even more young Taiwanese can go abroad to broaden their horizons,
MOFA officials said they have worked hard to negotiate similar agreements with
other countries in Europe and the Americas, but would not identify them before
deals are reached.</P>
      <P>The quotas set by New Zealand, Japan and Canada are usually quickly filled when
opened to applicants.</P>
      <P>The Taipei Office of the Interchange Association,  Japan's representative office
in Taiwan in the absence of diplomatic ties, said that Japan's 2,000-person
quota annually "could not meet demand."</P>
      <P>Travel to Australia, which does not impose quotas, best reflects the strong
interest among Taiwanese youths in the program.</P>
      <P>According to statistics published by the Australian government, it issued 2,311
visas for young Taiwanese between July 2006 and June 2007, 6,132 visas the
following year, 9,240 in 2008-2009, and 7,323 from July 2009 to March 2010.</P>
      <P>In comparison, the MOFA said Taiwan has issued only 94 visas to Australian
youths since the bilateral agreement was put into effect in November 2004 and
only 42 visas to New Zealand youths in six years.</P>
      <P>Because of the huge difference in the number of Taiwanese heading to New Zealand
and the number of New Zealanders coming here, Taipei's request for a higher
quota from Wellington was rejected.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has also issued 182 visas to Japanese youths, but the figure is far below
the 2,000-person quota.</P>
      <P>A Japanese woman and an Australian man said the difficulty in finding short-term
jobs and low pay explain to some extent why foreign youths are staying away.</P>
      <P>Twenty-two-year-old Hiroyo Nanai is a Japanese university student majoring in
law. She took a year off from school under the program to learn Mandarin because
of its increasing popularity.</P>
      <P>After staying in Taiwan for 10 months, she now speaks Mandarin fluently, has
made a lot of friends and traveled as far as the outlying Penghu Islands. But
she also said it is not easy for foreign youths to find short-term jobs, and
wages are too low compared to her country.</P>
      <P>She only found her first job after four months in Taiwan, selling Japanese
vinegar for a Taiwanese importer.</P>
      <P>Australian Blake Warren Stacey, 27,  said that working in McDonald's in
Australia paid about NT$420 per hour, compared with around NT$100 in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Stacey, who came to Taiwan to attend the World Games in Kaohsiung as a sumo
athlete last year, was impressed by Taiwan and decided to come again this year.</P>
      <P>He said, however, that Taiwanese employers are unfamiliar with the program, and
he often has to spend between 30 minutes and an hour explaining it, with some
even thinking that he is "an illegal worker."</P>

    <HEADLINE>United Daily News: Reflecting on 'Disaster of the Century'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>08/08/10  14:06:41
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government has made every effort to help survivors of Typhoon Morakot get
back on their feet and bolster disaster prevention a year after the storm, the
deadliest in a century, wreaked havoc in Taiwan. But the effort has not been
efficient or farsighted enough.</P>
      <P>The monster typhoon devastated southern Taiwan with massive flooding and
mudslides unseen in Taiwan in five decades and left more than 700 people dead or
unaccounted for. Among the battered areas, Kaohsiung's Siaolin village was
obliterated, with over 500 villagers buried alive.</P>
      <P>Japanese disaster prevention experts visited Siaolin after the storm hit to
investigate the causes behind the tragedy and then used their findings to adjust
Japan's disaster prevention measures. They concluded that the village was buried
because of a "deep collapse" -- in this case a landslide 84-meters deep rather
than the typical two to three meters -- triggered by unusually heavy downpours,
and that major landslides could occur on slopes with only slight inclines.</P>
      <P>The Japanese's proactive actions offer Taiwan a chance to reflect. We believe
that our disaster prevention mechanisms are still haphazard and the functions of
the central disaster response center are limited.</P>
      <P>"Once in a century disasters" do not necessarily occur only once in a century.
They may erupt faster and more frequently than we can imagine as global weather
conditions become increasingly treacherous.</P>
      <P>Only when we treat natural disasters as challenges that could hit at any minute
can we mitigate the damage to the greatest extent possible. (Editorial abstract

    <HEADLINE>Talk of the day -- Tourism talent in great demand</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>08/08/10  14:44:10
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan badly needs tourism talent, particularly tour guides versed in Mandarin
and various foreign languages, as more Chinese citizens and international
tourists visit the country,  travel industry executives said over the weekend.</P>
      <P>According to Tourism Bureau statistics, Chinese citizens have made more than
840,000 visits to Taiwan so far this year, leading to a shortage of Mandarin-
speaking tour guides.</P>
      <P>But Hsu Kao-ching,  secretary-general  of the Travel Agent Association of the
Republic of China, said the shortage should be resolved by the end of this year
when 9,000 newly accredited tour guides begin working.</P>
      <P>The far more serious problem facing the travel industry lies in the dire
shortage of tour guides who speak foreign languages, particularly Thai and
Korean, Hsu said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, travel industry sources said the booming tourism market has inspired
some people to pursue new careers by obtaining tour guide or tour leader
licenses.</P>
      <P>Also, an online poll for Taiwan's most special night market is entering its
final stage, with more and more people joining this first-ever tourism promotion
program.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from local media coverage of the issue:</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>Hsiao Chih-yang,  president  of a local tour group leader association,  said
many retired civil servants  and unemployed middle-aged people have attended
association-sponsored courses in preparation for accreditation examinations.</P>
      <P>"Some civil servants have also attended our evening courses after getting off
work in preparation for entering the travel business after retiring, " Hsiao
said, adding that a retired Air Force major general recently earned
accreditation as a tour group leader.</P>
      <P>Kuo-Su Tsan-yang, a former deputy director of the Tourism Bureau who secured
both English tour guide and group leader licenses in May, said, however, that he
does not aim to pursue a travel service career.</P>
      <P>Since Kuo-Su retired from the Tourism Bureau last year, he has been teaching
tourism-related courses at a local college.</P>
      <P>"I have asked my students to earn at least two travel service licenses. I felt
that I had to lead by example and registered for tour guide and group leader
accreditation tests in March, " Kuo-Su said. The experience allowed him to
review whether there existed any problems or flaws in Taiwan's accreditation
system, he added.</P>
      <P>Kuo-Su, who worked in South Korea, New Zealand, Australia and Germany for a
total of 11 years during his time at the Tourism Bureau, is now attending a
course to prepare himself for a tour operator accreditation examination to be
held late this year.</P>
      <P>By acquiring professional accreditations, Kuo-Su said he looks forward to
becoming a travel expert capable of providing useful guidance and helping
various groups develop tourism.</P>
      <P>With China expected to replace Japan as Taiwan's largest source of foreign
tourists, many people are preparing for Mandarin tour guide accreditation tests.</P>
      <P>In 2009, Taiwan had only 14,000 accredited Mandarin tour guides. As a result,
anybody with experience in serving Chinese tour groups was very busy.</P>
      <P>To address the problem, the Tourism Bureau recruited 9,000 candidates in May
this year through accreditation tests. These individuals will complete mandatory
training courses in several groups  in the coming months,  said Travel  Agent
Association secretary-general Hsu.</P>
      <P>"We believe the supply of Mandarin-speaking tour guides will be sufficient to
meet market demand by early next year," Hsu said.</P>
      <P>In contrast, Hsu said he is more concerned about the short supply of tour guides
who speak foreign languages.</P>
      <P>"The Tourism Bureau has devoted much energy to attracting tourists from
Thailand, South Korea and Muslim countries in recent years. However, we have not
seen any increase in the number of tour guides who can speak the languages of
those countries fluently, " Hsu lamented.</P>
      <P>Despite a steady rise of tourist arrivals from those countries, Taiwan has fewer
than 50 Thai-speaking tour guides, and the number of Korean-speaking tour guides
has also fallen short of the target by more than 100.</P>
      <P>"The demand for these two kinds of tour guides is so strong that nearly all
those who registered for Thai- and Korean-language tour guide accreditation have
earned licenses, " said Hsu, who added that Malay- and Indonesian-language-
speaking tour guides are also in short supply.</P>
      <P>In addition to urging the Tourism Bureau to come up with solutions to the
problems, Hsu also advised those aspiring to pursue a tourism career to seize
the opportunities in those sectors instead of seeking Mandarin tour guide
accreditation. (Aug. 8, 2020).</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>In an innovative effort to promote tourism, the Tourism Bureau launched a
campaign earlier this year to select the top night markets in five categories:
most popular, most environmentally friendly, most fascinating, easiest to shop
at, and best food.</P>
      <P>Besides expert assessments, local residents are also invited to give their
opinions in an online poll. The top 10 night markets selected in the first stage
are campaigning vigorously to win public support in the final week of the second
round of online voting.</P>
      <P>According to initial results, the Tainan Flowers Night Market, which operates
only on Thursdays, Saturdays and Sundays, has emerged as the most
environmentally friendly and most visitor-friendly.</P>
      <P>The oldest and most internationally renowned night market, the Shilin Night
Market in Taipei, has emerged as the frontrunner in the most fascinating,
easiest to shop at, and best food categories. (Aug. 8, 2010).</P>

    <HEADLINE>Birth rate suffers as financial pressure rises: survey</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's low birth rate can be attributed to growing financial pressure on
marriageable men, an online manpower agency said in a report issued on Father's
Day on Sunday.</P>
      <P>The 104 Job Bank report attributed Taiwan's low crude birth rate -- the lowest
in the world at 8.29 per 1,000 people last year -- to a serious shortage of
fathers, based on a survey it recently conducted.</P>
      <P>The survey found that 70 percent of male office workers who responded to the
poll said they would consider having a child only if there were a financial
surplus after deducting regular expenses from their monthly salaries.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 45 percent mentioned they would do so only after having saved enough
money to raise a child, and 28 percent said they would consider whether there
were older family members to help look after their children before having a
baby, according to the poll.</P>
      <P>The survey also found that their main sources of stress are "not earning enough
money, " mentioned by 79 percent of respondents, followed by work-related stress
(23 percent), poor job prospects (22 percent) , and working too many hours (22
percent) . Only 4 percent said they do not feel any stress.</P>
      <P>Max Fang, the online manpower agency's public relations manager, said that
according to the poll only 4 percent of male office workers chose a "double
income no kids," or DINK, lifestyle, while 67 percent said they were willing to
have children if the government would fully subsidize child care or pay for
babysitting services.</P>
      <P>The poll was conducted July 28-31 among male office workers in Taiwan, with
1,243 valid samples collected. It had a 95 percent confidence level and a margin
of error of plus or minus 2.65 percent.</P>
      <P>Also Sunday, insurance companies introduced various policies catering to fathers
with different needs.</P>
      <P>Increasing numbers of men in Taiwan are fathering their first child when they
are over 40 years old, and these fathers usually have heavy financial burdens
because they have to take care of their parents and children and prepare for
retirement, according to insurers.</P>
      <P>That means they have to choose insurance plans that work best for them, the
insurers said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Vincent Siew said Sunday that Typhoon Morakot, which triggered
the worst floods in Taiwan in a century last year, can be seen as a warning sign
of climate change and that humanity should seek to co-exist harmoniously with
nature.</P>
      <P>At an event to mark the first anniversary of Typhoon Morakot, Siew said the
damage caused by the typhoon was extremely serious, as reflected in TV reporting
at home and abroad, but due to the immediate and courageous efforts of rescuers
and disaster relief workers, the damage from the storm was reduced.</P>
      <P>Most of the relief workers were volunteers, but they engaged in acts of kindness
and expected nothing in return, Siew said.</P>
      <P>In addition to providing relief to typhoon victims, Taiwan's aid workers also
provided assistance to people affected by a powerful earthquake in Haiti in
early 2010 and the Sichuan earthquake in 2008, he said.</P>
      <P>Also held during the event organized by the Red Cross Society of the Republic of
China and the Typhoon Morakot Service Alliance, were a disaster relief drill, a
demonstration of disaster relief skills, and an exhibition on relief and
reconstruction in the wake of Typhoon Morakot.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>If our officials were not numb and had sharp minds, they should have sensed
simmering anger at the grassroots level over the government's longstanding
"development first" policy.</P>
      <P>The number of "environment vs. economy" clashes reported in the past couple of
months, including protests by Dapu and Siangshiliao farmers over land
expropriations, a white dolphin protection drive and several others, has
exceeded the combined total of those that took place in the past few years.</P>
      <P>The government should not overlook this emerging change in local social
sentiment. If it continues its "development at all cost" policy while paying lip
service to "environmental protection, " this growing social force will fight
back.</P>

attention to wildlife conservation and is trying to upgrade environmental
protection standards, can Taiwan, with per capita income of US$18,000, still
drag its feet in the "development at the expense of the environment" stage?</P>
      <P>Responding to the growing appeal for environmental awareness, President Ma Ying-
jeou declared last week that priority should be put on environmental protection
if a development project is deemed harmful to nature.</P>
      <P>Such a promise should be substantiated in practice, and the public is keeping
its eyes clearly focused on the government's actions. (Editorial abstract --

    <HEADLINE>Lawmakers push for passage of draft geology act</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 8 (CNA)
08/08/10  16:53:26
(By Kelven Huang and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislators across partisan lines pushed for the passage of a bill Sunday aimed
at preventing a repeat of the tragedy that occurred in Kaohsiung County's
Siaolin village last year during Typhoon Morakot.</P>
      <P>Opposition Democratic Progressive Party Legislator Tien Chiu-chin contended that
the disaster, in which many of the village's residents were buried alive by a
massive landslide, may have been prevented if the village's geological changes
were monitored beforehand under the stipulations of the draft geology act.</P>
      <P>The proposed legislation could help prevent heavy damage from landslides, Tien
said, by mandating nationwide geological surveys and safety  evaluations  and
the  publication  of information  on "geologically sensitive areas."</P>
      <P>Tien said the Japanese have already taken advantage of the Siaolin tragedy to
rethink their disaster prevention schemes.</P>
      <P>Japan's government broadcaster NHK sent a camera crew to the village and found
that the disaster was not caused by a typical rockslide or mudslide, but by a
"deep-seated landslide, " referring to a deep layer of earth that was dislodged
after being permeated and loosened by heavy downpours.</P>
      <P>Following the NHK report, the Japanese government re-examined parts of its
country and found there were at least 14 geologically sensitive areas around
Japan that were potentially susceptible to the threat of "deep-seated
landslides," she noted.</P>
      <P>Tien said the draft geology act would require the government to make public a
list of geologically sensitive areas nationwide and hopefully prevent
catastrophic landslides.</P>
      <P>The law would also help home buyers steer away from locations that are
susceptible to landslides, she said.</P>
      <P>"Such an important law is like a health checkup before a couple gets married. It
doesn't necessarily put a stop to the marriage but it reminds the newlyweds to
pay attention," she argued.</P>
      <P>Tien urged that the draft geology act be passed into law during an extraordinary
legislative session to be held in mid-August.</P>
      <P>Ruling Kuomintang Legislator Lin Tsang-min also backed the legislation, saying
it was not too late to take precautions after suffering such severe losses.</P>
      <P>"Better late than never.  Without a geology law,  private properties can still
be built and public construction projects developed on geologically sensitive
areas," Lin said.</P>
      <P>The legislator suggested, however, that the draft legislation, which was
approved by a legislative committee in May, was unlikely to clear the full
legislature in mid-August due to a tight legislative schedule.</P>
      <P>He expressed hopes that the draft bill will be passed into law during the next
regular legislative session.</P>
      <P>The new bill under consideration, a revised version of the 2004 measure, obliges
the Ministry of Economic Affairs to designate regions  with special geological
characteristics  or that are vulnerable to geological disasters as "geologically
sensitive areas."</P>
      <P>It also stipulates that a commission should be established to review proposals
to designate, change or abolish the listing of areas as "geologically sensitive,
" and that no fewer than half the members of the commission be experts and
scholars.</P>
      <P>Unlike the version of the act that nearly became law in 2004, the new measure
does not explicitly bar developers from building on "geologically sensitive"
land, but they would be restricted from launching projects on sites even
partially located on such land without conducting a geological survey and safety
evaluation.</P>

      <P>A young Hong Kong man edged out swimmers from Taiwan and China to win the 2010
long-distance swim between the Taiwan-held island of Kinmen and China's coastal
city of Xiamen on Sunday.</P>
      <P>Seventeen-year-old Ling Tienyu, one of four Hong Kong swimmers entered in the
event, swam the 7-kilometer distance in a time of 1 hour, 34 minutes 2 seconds,
reaching the finish line three seconds ahead of 21-year-old Taiwanese student
Pan Kai-wen.</P>
      <P>Nineteen-year-old Lin Yang from China finished third, another two seconds back.</P>
      <P>Hong Kong's Tang Natasha Sze, 18, was the fastest women swimmer in the event,
according to the Kinmen County government, which co-sponsored the long-distance
swimming competition for the second consecutive year.</P>
      <P>Yu Feng, a 53-year-old veteran swimmer from Fuzhou in China, said he had looked
forward to taking part in the Kinmen-Xiamen swim for a long time and insisted on
competing despite strong winds and heavy seas.</P>

Taiwan Strait," a confident Yu said.</P>
      <P>The 2010 Kinmen-Xiamen long-distance swimming competition brought together 90
swimmers from Taiwan, China, Hong Kong and Macau, but only 85 finished the race.</P>
      <P>The swimmers set out from Shuangkou on the island of Little Kinmen at 9: 20 a.m.
and swam seven kilometers to Yefengzhai in Xiamen.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Improving China ties founded on Constitution, '1992 consensus': Ma</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou reiterated Sunday his administration's China policy of
"no unification, no independence and no use of force" based on the Constitution
of the Republic of China and its continued commitment to improving cross-Taiwan
Strait relations.</P>
      <P>Ma, who doubles as chairman of the ruling Kuomintang (KMT), said during a
meeting of the party's Central Advisory Committee that his administration's
adherence to the "1992 consensus" reached between Taipei and Beijing has
contributed to the improving ties.</P>
      <P>The consensus, which critics contend has never existed, refers to a tacit
understanding between Taipei and Beijing that there is only one China but either
side is free to interpret the definition of one China, which Ma said his
administration insists is the ROC based on the country's Constitution.</P>
      <P>The formula has contributed to the resumption of cross-strait negotiations after
they were shelved for at least eight years before Ma took office in May 2008.</P>
      <P>The president said he has tried to improve cross-strait relations in order not
to let hostilities with China hinder the development of Taiwan's relations with
other countries.</P>
      <P>"We have achieved peace in the Taiwan Strait, in stark contrast to the situation
in the Korean Peninsula, where the two Koreas are still at war even 60 years
after the end of the Korean War (1950-1953), " Ma said.</P>
      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has harshly criticized his
China policy and especially initiatives to liberalize economic ties with China,
including signing an economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) with
Beijing.</P>
      <P>The DPP and other opposition figures have often asked Ma why the government did
not sign trade deals with other countries before signing one with China, to
which Ma replied on Sunday, "why didn't the DPP do that when it was in power
before 2008? The answer is clear. It wasn't able to."</P>
      <P>The president explained that after signing the ECFA with China, the country's
largest trade partner, on June 29, Taiwan will negotiate similar trade deals
with Singapore soon and other countries later.</P>
      <P>Ma said a comment by Central American Parliament Speaker Jacinto Suarez Espinoza
during a visit to Taiwan last month best conveyed the spirit of the ECFA.</P>
      <P>"The ECFA has nothing to do with us since you (Taiwan) are geographically far
away from us, but we are simply happy to see there is a place teeming with peace
in a world full of disorder and chaos," Ma quoted Suarez as saying.</P>
      <P>As to the question on how far future cross-strait relations will go, the
president said it depends on how both sides act to deepen their positive
exchanges to create a win-win situation.</P>
      <P>He said that Taiwan as a small country should deal with China with wisdom, while
China as a much bigger country should treat Taiwan with kindness, in accordance
with the ideal broached by Chinese philosopher Mencius about 2,300 years ago.</P>
      <P>"People on both sides of the strait have come to apply their ancestor's
teachings to solve their disputes. The KMT understands it's the right step and
we will continue to march forward bravely, " he said.</P>

      <P>After clinching match point, Cheng fell to the ground in tears. She said she
tumbled to the ground when her leg injury flared up while she was trying heading

"embarrassing."</P>
      <P>Cheng said she never thought about trying to defend her title, but focused
instead on playing every point solidly.</P>
      <P>"I'm not the kind of person who has big goals because that would put too much
pressure on me," she said. "I just want to do well every time I play. Otherwise,
I would be letting down the fans who are supporting me. I was very moved by
their support."</P>

      <P>Mainland Affairs Council Chairwoman Lai Shin-yuan denied reports Sunday after
returning home to Taiwan that she was forced to change her travel plans in the
United States because of pressure from China.</P>
      <P>Lai, who traveled to Washington, D.C. to brief groups in the United States on
the economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) that was signed with China
in late June, was unable to fly to Los Angeles as planned and returned to Taiwan
via New York instead.</P>
      <P>Local media reports said she was forced to cancel her visit to Los Angeles
because her speech in Washington reportedly irritated the Chinese government
because it said China was responsible for holding back cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>"Even though cross-strait relations have greatly improved, they are still
heavily impeded by two factors. First, mainland China is still continuing to
expand its military deployment against Taiwan and second the mainland
authorities are still not willing to change the policy and law that sanction the
use of force against Taiwan, " Lai said in Washington.</P>
      <P>"These are obstacles to the development of cross-strait relations and they need
to be eliminated," Lai added in her speech.</P>
      <P>The government's top China policy planner insisted, however, that the reports
that reaction to the speech led her to change her travel plans "are sheer
speculation without any solid basis or evidence."</P>
      <P>Lai attributed the cancellation to mechanical problems on the aircraft she was
supposed to take to Los Angeles, and she said that after trying unsuccessfully
for six or seven hours to secure a flight to the West Coast, she was forced to
return home via New York.</P>
      <P>The MAC chairwoman said she will visit Los Angeles later this year to meet with
Taiwanese immigrants there.</P>
      <P>On her Washington trip, Lai said U.S. officials, congressional members and think
tank scholars she met during her visit supported the signing of the cross-strait
ECFA and Taiwan and China's ongoing constructive interaction.</P>
      <P>"American friends in general highly support our ECFA deal with China as they
believe the agreement could be a catalyst for Taiwan to be included into
regional economic integration and forge closer economic ties with its major
trading partners," Lai said.</P>
      <P>American officials and opinion leaders also believe that the ECFA is something
worthy of encouragement even for the U.S., she added.</P>
      <P>According to an article carried in the Sunday edition of the United Evening
News, Chinese officials in charge of Taiwan affairs and think tank scholars met
all day Thursday after Lai said in Washington D.C. the previous day that China
should renounce the right to use force against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The article quoted unidentified Chinese officials and scholars as saying that
Taiwan should refrain from touching on such sensitive issues publicly to avoid
derailing cross-strait engagements or ruin the political basis for mutual
interaction.</P>
      <P>They argued that as long as Taiwan does not pursue de jure independence, it need
not care about China's missile deployments targeting the island, according to
the report.</P>

      <P>Billy Chang, the first Taiwanese dancer to have a major role with the world-
renowned circus group Cirque du Soleil, signed a new two-year contract with the
group recently and will appear in the new version of "Dralion" to be staged in
October.</P>
      <P>"I hope I can gain additional experience by playing different roles this time,"
Chang told the Central News Agency on Friday before flying to Canada for
training this weekend.</P>
      <P>He said he was fortunate that when he joined the group for the first time at the
end of 2008, he played a fire god in "Dralion," one of the main roles in the
show.</P>
      <P>Standing on the stage, wearing red make-up and swinging a big flag with plenty
of energy, the 26-year-old dancer's performance has become one of the most
popular characters in the show.</P>
      <P>"Dralion" is a fusion of dragon and lion that combines East and West and has
been performed over 370 times, including in Australia, New Zealand and Mexico
last year.</P>
      <P>When he came back to Taiwan recently, Chang realized that it was the intensive
education he gained in Taiwan that enabled him to be ready to "go for it" when
the chance came, he said.</P>
      <P>Chang always works hard to prepare himself -- no matter how late he finishes his
work during a tour, he gets up early to find a dance group or school to learn
more.</P>
      <P>"Dancing is what I breathe," Chang stressed.</P>
      <P>During his three-month break at home, his pace never slowed. He practiced with
the renowned Cloud Gate Dance Theater and at Taipei National University of the
Arts, and also spent time visiting nursing homes to help the elderly with their
rehabilitation, something he is good at.</P>
      <P>Using a combination of skills from dancing and Tai-chi to help an old
grandmother in Colorado stand up again was one of his happiest experiences of
the previous year.</P>
      <P>He has decided that if, after completing his two-year contract, he feels there
is nothing new to learn, he will return home to be a professional dancer and
apply what he has learned in Taiwan.</P>

      <P>For men who are unemployed and middle-aged or older, Father's Day was anything
but a day worth celebrating, a social activist group said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Scores of people protested outside the Executive Yuan Sunday to vent their
indignation over the many men of advanced age who are jobless and appealed to
the government to provide enterprises with incentives that will encourage
companies to hire people in older age brackets.</P>
      <P>Group leader Hsiao Chung-han said middle-aged unemployed people were the most
disadvantaged group in Taiwan's job market, because regardless of their
educational backgrounds or work experience, they were the least sought-after
group by manufacturers or service companies.</P>
      <P>The best jobs this group can find are as security guards, cleaners, household
caregivers, or in direct sales, Hsiao said.</P>
      <P>Of the 37,000 job openings created by the government based on a temporary
employment program following the 2008-2009 global economic downturn, only 12
percent were offered to people who were unemployed and aged over 45, he noted,

      <P>Taiwan opened a one-stop investment service center Sunday to facilitate its
drive to attract investment from around the world, a campaign expected to be
made easier by the elimination of three major hurdles.</P>
      <P>"The new center is like a large department store that can satisfy various needs
of foreign investors intending to launch new ventures or production lines in
Taiwan, " Premier Wu Den-yih said while presiding over the opening of the new
office.</P>
      <P>Three major barriers -- an insecure investment climate due to tensions in the
Taiwan Strait, a lack of direct cross-striat transportation links and high
corporate income taxes -- used to discourage foreign investment in Taiwan, Wu
said.</P>
      <P>But with cross-strait relations improved under President Ma Ying-jeou's flexible
diplomatic approach, Wu said Taiwan now boasts a secure investment environment,
and the opening of direct shipping and air links to China offers convenient
transportation services for the business sector.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Wu said, the reduction of the corporate income tax to 17 percent this
year and the tariff cuts on a number of products shipped to China under a
recently signed economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) have made Taiwan
even more competitive in attracting new investment from both home and abroad.</P>
      <P>"Now we hope the new service center will enhance our efficiency in dealing with
applications for launching new ventures in Taiwan, " Wu said, adding that the
new center will offer customized services for prospective investors.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, Minister of Economic Affairs Shih Yen-shiang, who
concurrently heads the new one-stop service center, said Taiwan  must seek
investment  from around  the world to fundamentally change its industrial
structure and create more jobs.</P>
      <P>"The new center will assign officials  to handle specific investment cases,
with efficiency and quality service as top priorities, " Shih said.</P>
      <P>He said the center will offer guidance on a wide range of issues, including
legal questions and issues related to daily life.</P>
      <P>On the recent controversies surrounding the Central Taiwan Science Park
expansion projects, Wu said the government will assume full responsibility to
resolve all relevant disputes.</P>
      <P>Even though environmental assessment disputes over the park's plan to expand to
Houli in Taichung County originated during the previous Democratic Progressive
Party administration, Wu said the current government will pool its wisdom to
find a solution to protect companies building new factories there from being
affected.</P>

fathers should not shy away from seeking outside help if they fall victim to
domestic violence.</P>

violence cases it handled last year were male, most of them involving
psychological mistreatment.</P>

from either seeking outside help or talking with others about their suffering.</P>
      <P>According to a report by the Ministry of the Interior (MOI), the male/female
ratio of domestic violence victims rose from 1:18 in 2002 to 1:9 in 2008.</P>

      <P>A driftwood sculpture workshop opened at a disused elementary school in eastern
Taiwan's Taitung County Sunday to mark the first anniversary of Typhoon Morakot
that battered Taiwan Aug.7-9, 2009, leaving more than 700 people dead or missing
and thousands homeless.</P>
      <P>Coastal areas of eastern and southern Taiwan were swamped with an estimated 1
million of tons of driftwood in the wake of the typhoon, as the storm cut a
swathe through the country's forests and washed down many precious trees and
deadwood from the mountains to the sea. In Taitung County alone, 177,000 tons of
driftwood have so far been collected and the cleanup work is still very far from
over.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Forestry Bureau decided to set up a driftwood workshop at disused
Duoliang Elementary School in an effort to turn deadwood into wooden toys,
building blocks and artistic items.</P>
      <P>Bureau officials said several private companies and volunteer groups have
assisted in the establishment of the new workshop.</P>
      <P>Since July, the bureau has opened training courses to teach aboriginal people
residing in Taitung County to sculpt lifeless driftwood into toy bricks and
other toys, the officials said, adding that 21 aborigines have finished a basic
training program.</P>
      <P>An Australian educational goods distributor has placed an order with the
workshop for 10 containers of building blocks, the officials said, adding that
the order will help keep the workshop running for one year.</P>
      <P>In the future, the workshop will attract more orders from home and abroad and
set up distribution channels in local market, the officials added.</P>

      <P>For men who are unemployed and middle-aged or older, Father's Day was anything
but a day worth celebrating, a social activist group said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Scores of people protested outside the Executive Yuan Sunday to vent their
indignation over the many men of advanced age who are jobless and appealed to
the government to provide enterprises with incentives that will encourage
companies to hire people in older age brackets.</P>
      <P>Group leader Hsiao Chung-han said middle-aged unemployed people were the most
disadvantaged group in Taiwan's job market, because regardless of their
educational backgrounds or work experience, they were the least sought-after
group by manufacturers or service companies.</P>
      <P>The best jobs this group can find are as security guards, cleaners, household
caregivers, or in direct sales, Hsiao said.</P>
      <P>Of the 37,000 job openings created by the government based on a temporary
employment program following the 2008-2009 global economic downturn, only 12
percent were offered to people who were unemployed and aged over 45, he noted,
and he urged authorities to create incentives to hire older workers.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan opened a one-stop investment service center Sunday to facilitate its
drive to attract investment from around the world, a campaign expected to be
made easier by the elimination of three major hurdles.</P>
      <P>"The new center is like a large department store that can satisfy various needs
of foreign investors intending to launch new ventures or production lines in
Taiwan, " Premier Wu Den-yih said while presiding over the opening of the new
office.</P>
      <P>Three major barriers -- an insecure investment climate due to tensions in the
Taiwan Strait, a lack of direct cross-striat transportation links and high
corporate income taxes -- used to discourage foreign investment in Taiwan, Wu
said.</P>
      <P>But with cross-strait relations improved under President Ma Ying-jeou's flexible
diplomatic approach, Wu said Taiwan now boasts a secure investment environment,
and the opening of direct shipping and air links to China offers convenient
transportation services for the business sector.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Wu said, the reduction of the corporate income tax to 17 percent this
year and the tariff cuts on a number of products shipped to China under a
recently signed economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) have made Taiwan
even more competitive in attracting new investment from both home and abroad.</P>
      <P>"Now we hope the new service center will enhance our efficiency in dealing with
applications for launching new ventures in Taiwan, " Wu said, adding that the
new center will offer customized services for prospective investors.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, Minister of Economic Affairs Shih Yen-shiang, who
concurrently heads the new one-stop service center, said Taiwan  must seek
investment  from around  the world to fundamentally change its industrial
structure and create more jobs.</P>
      <P>"The new center will assign officials  to handle specific investment cases,
with efficiency and quality service as top priorities, " Shih said.</P>
      <P>He said the center will offer guidance on a wide range of issues, including
legal questions and issues related to daily life.</P>
      <P>On the recent controversies surrounding the Central Taiwan Science Park
expansion projects, Wu said the government will assume full responsibility to
resolve all relevant disputes.</P>
      <P>Even though environmental assessment disputes over the park's plan to expand to
Houli in Taichung County originated during the previous Democratic Progressive
Party administration, Wu said the current government will pool its wisdom to
find a solution to protect companies building new factories there from being
affected.</P>

      <P>The Taipei Women's Rescue Foundation (TWRF) said on Father's Day Sunday that
fathers should not shy away from seeking outside help if they fall victim to
domestic violence.</P>
      <P>Though they are the perpetrators of most domestic violence cases, men can also
be the victims of domestic violence, said TWRF chief executive officer Kang Shu-
hua.</P>
      <P>Citing TWRF figures, Kang said that 13.1 percent of the victims in domestic
violence cases it handled last year were male, most of them involving
psychological mistreatment.</P>
      <P>But due to stereotypes in gender perception, males are more inclined to refrain
from either seeking outside help or talking with others about their suffering.</P>
      <P>According to a report by the Ministry of the Interior (MOI), the male/female
ratio of domestic violence victims rose from 1:18 in 2002 to 1:9 in 2008.</P>
      <P>The foundation encouraged fathers victimized by family violence to bravely ask
for help by calling the MOI hotline at 0800-013-999.</P>

    <HEADLINE>China Times: Races that could reshape the political landscape</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>08/09/10  10:36:26
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Kaohsiung County Magistrate Yang Chiu-hsing is determined to throw his hat into
the ring in the Kaohsiung Municipality mayoral election as an independent.
Another opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) heavyweight, Tainan City
Mayor Hsu Tain-tsair, may follow suit by running  in Tainan Municipality
without  his party's endorsement.</P>
      <P>These decisions may not be just a matter of revolt or "civil war" inside the
DPP, but could cause big ripples in the November elections and ultimately
reshape Taiwan's political landscape.</P>
      <P>Lopsided support for the DPP in the two southern municipalities have given Yang
and Hsu the confidence that they have a chance to beat their party's nominees,
even with a split vote, because the candidates of the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) do
not pose much of a threat.</P>
      <P>The KMT's failure to field strong standard-bearers in the two southern districts
has prompted its local factions to throw in their lot with the DPP candidates.
The KMT's "black" faction in the Kaohsiung constituency, for instance, is
standing behind incumbent Kaohsiung City Mayor Chen Chu of the DPP, rather than
the KMT candidate Huang Chao-shun.</P>
      <P>Right after Yang announced last week that he plans to run, the KMT's "white"
faction voiced support for him in an effort to spike Chen's chances and to
protect its own interest.</P>
      <P>Moreover, several major Kaohsiung County-based business and social groups and
even smaller factions inside the DPP are rallying behind Yang.</P>
      <P>These developments could signal a shift in factional alliances and forces,
within both the blue and green camps, for the 2012 presidential election.

    <HEADLINE>Talk of the day -- Plan to cut rice wine price up in the air</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>08/09/10  12:48:18
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The front-page stories in the Monday editions of the three major local dailies
addressed  different  topics,  ranging  from an international row over Taiwan's
plan to cut its rice wine prices, to Taiwan's arms procurement plan and
Kaohsiung County Magistrate Yang Chiu-hsing's imminent announcement of his
electoral bid.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from the coverage of the issues:</P>
      <P>United daily News:</P>
      <P>The government may have to suspend its plan to revise the Tobacco and Alcohol
Tax Act to pave the way for halving the price of rice, as the United States and
the European Union are threatening to take the matter to the World Trade
Organization (WTO).</P>
      <P>If this happens, it will be the first suit against Taiwan in the WTO since the
country's accession to the world trade regulatory body in 2002.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan passed a draft package of amendments in July to lower the tax
on rice wine from NT$29.25 per 0.6-liter bottle -- a rate applied to distilled
alcohol -- to NT$5.4 -- a rate applied to cooking ingredients.</P>
      <P>This means retailers will be able to slash the price of rice wine from NT$50 to
NT$25 per bottle.</P>
      <P>In line with WTO regulations, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) publicized the
planned amendments on July 28 so that other WTO members could respond to the
proposal within 60 days.</P>
      <P>The MOF said the EU Commission immediately reminded Taiwan to abide by the terms
of its accession to the WTO, which means rice wine should continue to be taxed
as a distilled alcoholic beverage rather than a cooking ingredient.</P>
      <P>The U.S. reaction was even more direct, as it reminded Taiwan that Japan and
South Korea have lost suits in similar disputes in the past, the MOF said.</P>
      <P>Citing the results of recent public surveys it had commissioned, the MOF said
Taiwanese will not change from using rice wine as a cooking ingredient rather
than a drink, even if the price is sharply reduced.</P>
      <P>"We hope these findings will help convince  U.S.  and EU authorities that the
rice wine price cut will have no impact on their brandy and whisky
distilleries," said an MOF official.</P>
      <P>The ministry had planned to submit the package of amendments to the Legislative
Yuan this week for screening and approval in the new session. It is not yet
known whether the MOF will stick to this schedule.(Aug. 9, 2010).</P>
      <P>Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>Taiwan's hopes of procuring eight diesel electric submarines and 66 F-16 C/D jet
fighters from the United States have dimmed as China has brought intense
pressure to bear against the plan.</P>
      <P>Naval authorities said it remains to be seen whether the Taiwan government has
the mettle to build smaller submarines on its own as its long-term efforts to
purchase submarines from the U.S. have proved futile.</P>
      <P>As to the aircraft procurement project, the Taiwan Air Force had intended to buy
66 F-16 C/Ds from the U.S. to replace its aging F-5E/Fs that are scheduled to be
retired this year</P>
      <P>However, due to Beijing's strong opposition, the U.S. is unlikely to sell the

      <P>Kaohsiung County Magistrate Yang Chiu-hsing of the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) was scheduled to make a formal announcement  Monday  on
his decision  to enter the Kaohsiung Municipality mayoral election as an
independent.</P>
      <P>Yang  is  expected  to  stress  that  he will  pursue  a middle-of-the-road
policy in an effort to turn the traditional "blue vs. green" partisan wrangling
into healthy concern for the needs of the people and focus on balanced national
development.</P>
      <P>His electoral bid will lead to a split vote in the green camp as the DPP has
nominated Kaohsiung City Mayor Chen Chu to carry its flag in the November
municipality election. Chao Tien-lin, spokesman for the Chen campaign, said
Sunday the party will make a last-ditch effort to convince Yang to drop his bid.

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan's top steel maker mulls stake in FPG Vietnam investment</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 9 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>China Steel Corp., the largest steel maker in Taiwan, said Monday that it is
studying the feasibility of taking a stake in a Formosa Plastics Group's (FPG's)
investment in Vietnam.</P>
      <P>"We are considering the possibility of investing in FPG's steel plant (to be
built) in Vietnam's Ha Tinh Province, " China Steel Executive Vice President
L.M. Chung said.</P>
      <P>"We are looking into whether and how the investment will boost shareholders'
value and make China Steel more profitable, " Chung added.</P>
      <P>Local media reported earlier that day that China Steel might take a stake of up
to 10 percent in the plant and that the investment proposal will be submitted to
the China Steel board of directors for approval later this month, adding that
the investment is likely to be finalized by the end of this year at the
earliest.</P>
      <P>The media said the investment is expected to help both sides in terms of product
development and technology exchanges.</P>
      <P>However, Chung declined to disclose the actual size of the stake it is eyeing in
FPG plant, which will be capitalized at US$2.7 billion with a total investment
of about US$80 billion.</P>
      <P>"As the FPG investment in Vietnam is huge, China Steel is unlikely to hold a
large stake should the company decide to go ahead with the investment," said
Chung.</P>
      <P>FPG, one of Taiwan's largest conglomerates, owns businesses in various  sectors
such  as petrochemicals,  semiconductors  and biotechnology.</P>
      <P>The group has secured approval from the Vietnamese authorities to build the
Vietnam steel complex with annual production capacity of 7.5 million tons in the
first phase of development.</P>
      <P>According  to news reports,  China Steel wants to further strengthen  its
business ties with FPG,  as the petrochemical conglomerate has taken a 5 percent
stake in China Steel's US$600 million cold-rolled steel plant that will be built
near Vietnam's Ho Chi Minh City.</P>
      <P>Chung  said the ties  with  FPG weigh  on the investment consideration to some
extent, but reiterated that any investment has to be profitable for China Steel.</P>
      <P>China Steel obtained the greenlight from Vietnam earlier this year to build the
steel plant and the company is aiming to complete construction by the end of
2012, with commercial production scheduled to begin in 2013.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A rift might be brewing between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>A recent speech given by Mainland Affairs Council Chairwoman Lai Shin-yuan in
Washington, D.C. in which she said China's continued expansion  of "military
deployment  against  Taiwan"  and its unwillingness to "change its policy and
laws that sanction the use of force against Taiwan" are two hindrances to any
further improvement in bilateral ties has created grave concern in Beijing.</P>
      <P>China reportedly will issue a solemn response in the coming days, and in what is
seen as a fence-mending measure, Lai has already cut short her U.S. trip and
returned home, although the reason she gave was that "aircraft mechanical
failure" prevented her from continuing on a scheduled visit to Los Angeles and
forced her to return to Taipei via New York instead.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan's top China policy planner, Lai did not need to make those statements
at the moment. For one thing, Beijing has argued that its Anti-Secession Law
only targets those who pursue de jure Taiwan independence. Lai's remarks,
however, have touched a sensitive political nerve in Beijing, leading China's
leaders to doubt Taiwan's real intentions.</P>
      <P>At the moment, both sides should still base their engagements on the "1992
consensus" or the "one China, separate interpretations" consensus that allows
both sides to pursue shared interests despite their differences on the
definition of "one China."</P>
      <P>The "92 consensus" is a concept that is still being shaped and developed, and is
capable of warding off dangerous conflict. Neither side should try to ruin this
delicate "paper window." (Editorial abstract -- Aug. 9, 2010).</P>

    <HEADLINE>Economic Daily News: New challenges in Taiwan-Singapore FTA talks</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>08/09/10  15:09:26
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan and Singapore announced a plan last week to explore the feasibility of a
bilateral economic cooperation agreement on a par with a free trade agreement
(FTA).</P>
      <P>The move is of profound significance as it comes on the heels of Taiwan
concluding a landmark economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) with China
and could inspire other countries to follow suit.</P>
      <P>One of the primary goals in striking the ECFA deal is to protect Taiwan from
being marginalized in the face of the growing waves of regional economic
integration, but whether Taiwan can sign FTA-like accords with its major trading
partners will be a major yardstick to gauge the value of the ECFA.</P>
      <P>The start of Taiwan-Singapore trade talks, however, also pose challenges for
Taiwan. For one thing, Taiwan must wait and see whether China will only allow
Taiwan to negotiate similar economic deals with the eight countries or areas
that have already signed FTAs or FTA-like deals with Beijing -- Hong Kong,
Macao, Chile, Singapore, Pakistan, New Zealand, Peru and Costa Rica.</P>
      <P>Singapore accounts for a mere 3.2 percent of Taiwan's overall foreign trade and
if Taiwan wants to be included in the global economic system, it needs to
conclude FTAs with its key trading partners, such as the U.S., Japan, the
European Union, South Korea and other ASEAN member states in addition to
Singapore.</P>
      <P>Another challenge lies in the fact that Singapore is a free trade port that
offers tariff-free treatment for 99 percent of goods. Multinational business
groups also face fewer barriers to launching new ventures or service footholds
there. In FTA talks, Taiwan will have to offer much more preferential treatment
to Singapore than vice-versa.  Is Taiwan  suitably  prepared  to cope with such
market-opening pressure?</P>
      <P>With trade liberalization the ultimate economic policy goal, the government
should speed up economic reform and the cultivation of cross-strait  trust to
facilitate  Taiwan's quest for economic globalization. (Editorial abstract --

      <P>Taiwanese tennis player Lu Yen-hsun continued to roll forward by defeating
Marius Copil of Romania 7-6(5) , 5-7, 6-3 in the qualifying of the Toronto's
Rogers Cup, helping him seize a spot in the main draw.</P>
      <P>Copil ranks as the world's No. 279 but put up a tough fight against top 50
player Lu, holding the spectators on the edges of their seats.</P>
      <P>Lu had a bit of trouble taking Copil's fast serves at the beginning of the
match, which was interrupted by rain, and it took him some time to figure them
out and find ways to beat his opponent.</P>
      <P>When the game was over, Copil's coach, Radu Popescu, marveled to a CNA reporter
about how "Lu started the game with serves of only 190 kph. But when it came to
the third set, usually exhausting for other players, Lu still managed serves of
up to 205 kph. That's amazing."</P>
      <P>Lu said later that he knew the third set was crucial and he had to pull out all
the stops to go for the win against such a powerful adversary.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese expatriates among the spectators also encouraged Lu a lot by holding
giant Republic of China flags and waving smaller ones.</P>

84 percent of 1st serve points and took four out of nine break points.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan communicates with WTO members over lower rice wine prices</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  9 (CNA)
08/09/10  15:54:56

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government is communicating with the United States and the European Union to
alleviate concerns that a government move to revise the law to reduce the tax
rate on rice wine could lead to undercutting of the spirits market by rice wine,
a Ministry of Finance official said Monday.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan passed a draft amendment to the Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Law
last month, planning to adjust the tax on rice wine by moving it from the
distilled spirit category to the cooking wine category.</P>
      <P>Under the draft amendment, the tax on a 0.6-liter bottle of rice wine will be
reduced from NT$29.25 (US$0.93) to NT$5.4 and the price of a bottle of rice wine
will be cut to NT$25 from NT$50.</P>
      <P>The price adjustment has sparked questions in the U.S. and the E.U. as to
whether it violates the regulations of the World Trade Organization (WTO), of
which Taiwan is a member.</P>
      <P>The E.U. has threatened to take legal action with the WTO against the move,
according to local media reports.</P>
      <P>The government has completed public opinion surveys that prove conclusively that
96.4 percent of the population in Taiwan use rice wine solely for cooking rather
than drinking to convince the U.S., the E.U. and WTO members that lowering rice
wine prices will not have an impact on other types of alcohol, according to the
official.</P>
      <P>But with the U.S. and the E.U. -- the main producers of brandy and whisky --
still speculating that once the price of rice wine is lowered, it will replace
whisky, brandy and other varieties of alcohol, the government plans to carry out
another survey to prove that the speculation is groundless, the official added.</P>
      <P>Rice wine is different from distilled spirits such as brandy and whisky, the
official went on, adding that the public will not drink the kitchen staple
instead of other types of alcohol just because the price is cut and that the
government will provide figures to allow other countries to gain an
understanding of the alcohol market situation in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Vice Premier Sean Chen said Monday that the government will do its
utmost to make WTO members understand that rice wine in Taiwan is used for
cooking, not drinking, including inviting them to taste rice wine chicken soup
-- a traditional Taiwanese winter warmer.</P>
      <P>On the fact that Japan and South Korea lost WTO dispute settlement cases over
reducing the tax rates on Japanese sake and Korean soju, Chen said that the
conditions are totally different, pointing out that rice wine is a cooking
ingredient while sake and soju are for drinking.</P>
      <P>Since Taiwan joined the WTO in 2002, rice wine tax reductions have been an issue
of public concern in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In 1998, when negotiations were under way on Taiwan's entry into the WTO, the
Taiwanese delegation was unable to get the U.S. and Europe to agree to classify
rice wine as cooking wine, which would have made it subject to a lower tax rate,
according to the official.</P>

      <P>Taiwan share prices closed up 0.89 percent Monday, holding above the 8,000 point
level, as buying rotated to the financial sector amid renewed optimism over a
major trade pact that was signed recently between Taiwan and China, dealers
said.</P>
      <P>The weighted index rose 71.19 points to 8,034.49, after moving between 7,971.19
and 8,040.94 on turnover of NT$124.48 billion (US$3.92 billion).</P>
      <P>The market opened up 0.14 percent on follow through buying in old economy
stocks, and the momentum extended as interest rotated to financial heavyweights
on high hopes that the sector will reap benefits from easier access to the China
market, dealers said.</P>
      <P>A total of 2,237 stocks closed up and 1,391 down, while 277 remained unchanged.</P>
      <P>The paper and pulp sector posted the highest gains, rising 3.6 percent. The
financial sector rose 2.6 percent, the cement sector 1.4 percent, the plastics
and chemical sector 0.9 percent and the construction sector 0.6 percent.</P>
      <P>The machinery and electronics sector gained 0.5 percent, while both the textile
and foodstuff sectors added 0.1 percent.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the Taiwan-China  economic  cooperation framework  agreement
(ECFA) ,  Taiwan banks have been granted preferential status as they prepare to
upgrade their representative offices in China to branches. The bar has also been
set lower for them, compared to other foreign banks, to trade in Chinese Yuan in
China.</P>
      <P>"Although the signing of the ECFA was in June, it is still having an effect on
the local financial sector which had been waiting for a long time for this boost
to their bottom line, " Mega Securities analyst Alex Huang said.</P>
      <P>"As the sector remained cheap, institutional investors favored financial  stocks
after comparing  their earnings outlook with relatively low valuations," he
said.</P>
      <P>High liquidity in the market also encouraged investors to pick up financial
stocks, which propelled the index past 8,000 points, he said.</P>
      <P>However, the bourse is unlikely to hold consistently above that point at this
time, he added.</P>
      <P>"Concerns over the slower growth pace of the global economy still remain .
Today's gains may pave the way for profit taking, " Huang said, referring to the
worse-than-expected U.S. non farm payroll data.</P>
      <P>Chang Hwa Bank rose 5.25 percent to NT$19.05, First Financial gained 3.88
percent to reach NT$20.10 and Taiwan Cooperative Bank increased 3.86 percent to
NT$22.85.</P>
      <P>In the paper and pulp sector, Cheng Loong rose 6.67 percent to NT$12.80 and
Chung Hwa Pulp increased 3.01 percent to NT$15.40.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>United Microelectronics Corp. (UMC) , the world's second-largest contract
chipmaker, said Monday it recorded a 4.7 percent increase in sales for July from
a month earlier, on the back of strong global demand for consumer electronics.</P>
      <P>Last month, UMC posted NT$10.82 billion (US$341 million) in sales, a figure that
was also up 59.15 percent from a year earlier.</P>
      <P>"While the global PC sector is witnessing a slower pace of growth, demand for
consumer electronics, in particular communications goods, remains robust, "
Concord Securities analyst Jim Cheng said.</P>
      <P>"UMC has been one of the main beneficiaries of the world's semiconductor
business and the July sales increase came as no surprise," Cheng said.</P>
      <P>He said global demand for consumer electronics products is expected to continue
into August and September, adding that UMC's sales in the third quarter are
likely to total NT$32 billion, compared with NT$29.75 billion recorded in the
second quarter.</P>
      <P>In an investor conference held last week, UMC predicted that its sales in the
third quarter will rise 5 percent-10 percent from the second quarter.</P>
      <P>UMC's production capacity was fully utilized in the second quarter and the
company said it expects the full utilization to continue in the third quarter.</P>
      <P>"I agree with the company's assessment, " Cheng said, although he added that
"demand is expected to turn weaker in the fourth quarter once IC shipments for
the Christmas season are largely completed by the end of September, which will
compromise production utilization in the fourth quarter."</P>
      <P>Cheng said that due to the expected slower pace of growth in the fourth quarter,
UMC shares are expected to trade in a range between NT$12 and NT$15 in the near
future.</P>

      <P>The bureau then commissioned experts from the Taipei-based China Corporation
Register of Shipping and marine investigators to look into the causes of the
accident and announced the suspension of the ferry services.</P>
      <P>According to an initial inspection, the bureau judged that the accident was
probably caused by insufficient deceleration of the ferry amid powerful wind and
waves.</P>
      <P>Noting that the OceanLaLa is only six years old, the bureau said the accident
could not be attributed  to the ship's physical condition.</P>
      <P>It was not the first accident sustained by the OceanLaLa. Earlier this year, its
services were suspended because equipment inside the vessel was damaged by a
storm.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the ferry's owner, Excalibur International Marine Corp., said it
plans to buy new vessels to replace the OceanLaLa.</P>
      <P>The company was scheduled to hold a shareholders' meeting the following day,
followed by a meeting of the board of directors, during which Liu Wen-hsiung is
expected to be elected as its chairman, according to company sources.</P>
      <P>Liu said the company plans to purchase new vessels and will target passengers
traveling between Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>In addition to the Taichung-Penghu route, the OceanLaLa also made charter trips
between Taichung and China's southeastern coastal city of Xiamen and eastern
Zhejiang Province's Taizhou City.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Ministry of Transportation and Communications' Department of
Aviation and Navigation said Monday that the high- speed OceanLaLa catamaran,
made of aluminum alloy, has the advantage of being lightweight and speedy but is
unsuitable for the high seas.</P>
      <P>It also noted that the OceanLaLa is a second-hand vessel that was formerly used
to ply the route between Spain and Morocco.</P>

    <HEADLINE>New Taiwan manufacturing index gives sector a 'green' light</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan Institute of Economic Research (TIER) unveiled on Monday Taiwan's
first monitoring indicator system using a color index that specifically  targets
the country's manufacturing sector, and said the sector showed stable growth in
June.</P>
      <P>For the index's debut on Monday, the research institute released indicators for
the manufacturing sector for every month since November 2009.</P>
      <P>The sector flashed a green light in June, after showing a yellow-red light --
reflecting mild overheating -- for the first seven months that data was
compiled, reflecting slowing growth in the sector, according to the research
institute.</P>
      <P>TIER President David Hong said that while the new color scale system is similar
to that used by the Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) , the
CEPD's indicators reflect general economic conditions rather than the strength
of specific industries.</P>
      <P>"TIER wants to provide indicators  reflecting  changes  in individual industries
in Taiwan's manufacturing sector and help government  agencies,  businesses,
stock  investors,  financial institutions  and academic  institutes  better
understand  the situation," Hong said.</P>
      <P>Under the five-color scale used by both agencies, a red light indicates
overheating, a yellow-red light reflects mild overheating, a green light signals
stable growth, a yellow-blue light reflects a slowdown, and a blue light
indicates contraction.</P>
      <P>The institute will release its manufacturing indicators at the beginning of each
month for the period two months earlier, because of the need to wait for
published economic data, said Chu Cheng-Chung, a consultant to the institute.</P>
      <P>TIER's index surveys 71 industries that account for 80 percent of the total
output of Taiwan's manufacturing sector, and will give each industry a light by
comparing its performance year-on-year.</P>
      <P>A "projected" green light was flashed for the manufacturing sector in June
because individual industries accounting for over half (57.47 percent) of
Taiwan's manufacturing output showed a green light.</P>
      <P>The "projected" tag was given for June because of the difficulty in gathering
related data, and an adjusted light for June will be issued next month, Chu
said.</P>
      <P>He also speculated  that the TIER could  apply a similar measurement system to
the service sector in the future.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Flat panel maker Chimei Innolux Corp. predicted Monday that product prices would
rebound in September after further declines in August.</P>
      <P>At an investor conference, Tuan Hsing-chien,  company vice chairman and chief
executive officer, said that as flat panel supplies continue to rise and demand
remains little changed, he expects product prices to fall more than 5 percent in
August following a drop of about 5 percent in July.</P>
      <P>Tuan said that after declines in recent months, he expects product prices to hit
bottom and to rebound in September.</P>
      <P>In the second quarter, Chimei Innolux posted NT$9.54 billion (US$301 million) in
net profit, up 182 percent from the first quarter. The jump was the result of a
merger of Chi Mei Corp., Innolux Display Corp. and TPO Displays Corp. in March.</P>
      <P>In the April-June period, gross margin of Chimei Innolux stood at 12.8 percent,
while its operating margin was 7.9 percent, the company said.</P>
      <P>Tuan said the company's production capability was 95-100 percent utilized in the
past quarter.</P>
      <P>He said that in the first half of this year, Chimei Innolux's capital
expenditure ranged between NT$30 billion and NT$40 billion, adding that spending
for 2011 is expected to total NT$80 billion to NT$100 billion due to expansion
of its 6th and 8.5th generation plants.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the company said its sales in July rose 1.1 percent from June to
NT$45.9 billion, while it shipped about 10.2 million large-sized flat panels --
defined as 10 inches or larger -- marking a 5.6 percent drop from a month
earlier.</P>
      <P>July's shipments of small and medium-sized panels fell 10 percent from June to
32.7 million units, it added.</P>

      <P>Flat panel firm AU Optronics Corp. (AOU) said its sales in July fell 10.9
percent from June to NT$38.87 billion (US$1.23 billion).</P>
      <P>While the company did not give the reason behind the fall, Grand Cathay
Securities analyst Mars Hsu said the decline reflected slower Chinese demand for
large-sized panels -- 10 inches or larger -- due to high inventories.</P>
      <P>"Large-sized panels are AUO's major revenue source and weakening demand in China
had an impact on the sales," Hsu said.</P>
      <P>The July figure was still up 19.4 percent from a year earlier.</P>
      <P>Last month, AUO's large-sized panel shipments -- widely used in desktop
monitors, notebook computers, LCD TVs -- were just more than 9.25 million units,
down by 4.9 percent from the previous month.</P>
      <P>July shipments in small and-medium-sized panels totaled 17.30 million units,
however, up 9.6 percent from June month-over-month.</P>

      <P>A video installation art exhibition will open at the Kuandu Museum of Fine Arts
in suburban Taipei Aug. 20, featuring works by 10 contemporary artists from four
countries, an event organizer said Monday.</P>
      <P>The exhibition, titled "Di-stance, " made its debut in Paris in April to rave
reviews, curator Huang Shan-shan said in a press conference in Taipei.</P>
      <P>In addition to showing the works by the 10 artists to show their stances and
attitudes toward distance, the Taipei show -- the second leg of the exhibition
-- will also include a film festival in cooperation with Le Fresnoy, the well-
known French institute for contemporary arts.</P>
      <P>"The part will showcase a one-hour film composed of 10 short videos created by
artists from France, the Netherlands, Switzerland and several other countries,"
Huang said.</P>
      <P>The initial concept of the exhibition was brought up in Paris and was incubated
in Taipei, she went on, adding that the conversations among the artists from
France, Japan, Korea and Taiwan showed different but interesting views that have
become creative and energetic elements of the exhibition.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese artist Chou Yu-Chen will present his work titled "Story Telling, " in
which he shares bedside stories from his parents, while Korean artist Kang Hyun
Wook's work titled "We Say What? " presents social issues through the eyes of a
couple and French artist Stephane Pichard presents other aspects about the world
we live in.</P>
      <P>"The viewers can see the attitudes and stances of different artists from various
cultures through the works," Huang said.</P>
      <P>In order to introduce more information about video art and the exhibition, a
book on the subject has also recently been published, titled "Di-stances."</P>
      <P>The Taiwan leg of the exhibition will run through Sept. 26, and will then go to

      <P>With the use of a new construction material, a local charity has been able to
build 700 permanent houses in just 88 days for people who lost their homes in a
devastating typhoon last year.</P>
      <P>Using a lightweight steel structure that was developed recently, the Tzu Chi
Foundation built 756 permanent two-story houses, two churches, a community
center and six classrooms/offices in Shanlin Township, Kaohsiung County, between
November 2009 and February 2010.</P>
      <P>This achievement highlights the efficiency of the foundation, which funded four
government housing projects in southern Taiwan after Typhoon Morakot's
devastation of the area in August 2009.</P>
      <P>Tzu Chi decided to skip the usual step of housing disaster victims in temporary
prefabricated homes, and instead built permanent structures for displaced people
who were in emergency shelters.</P>
      <P>Two considerations may have been to avoid the disputes that have cropped in the
past over prefabricated housing and to complete the houses and settle the
families before Chinese New Year in February.</P>
      <P>The lightweight steel used in the construction of the buildings is more
earthquake resistant than reinforced concrete. The design of the houses included
good ventilation and the use of calcium silicate insulation in the walls to keep
the interiors cool in summer. The exterior walls were gravel coated, which makes
them more durable.</P>
      <P>The most difficult of aspect of the project was the surfacing of roads. An eco-
friendly design of interlocking bricks instead of asphalt was used so that water
can seep through the bricks and into the ground to replenish the ground water
level.</P>
      <P>Tzu Chi mobilized some 3,000 volunteers per day from around Taiwan to help the
professional bricklayers, and the roads were completed on time, with the help of
the military.</P>
      <P>All four Tzu Chi projects were completed before the Aug. 8 anniversary of the
typhoon disaster and 4,500 people were given new homes.</P>
      <P>The foundation's experience in planning and its vast army of volunteers working
more than 350,000 shifts were the key to its success in finishing the projects
so quickly.</P>

      <P>Representatives from Taiwan's Yushan National Park and Adamello Brenta Nature
Park in northern Italy signed a cooperation agreement Monday on wildlife
protection and nature conservation.</P>
      <P>The agreement was inked by Yushan National Park Headquarters (YNPH)
Superintendent Chen Lung-sheng and Adamello Brenta Nature Park Chairman
Antonello Zulberti at the YNPH office in Nantou County's Shuili township in
central Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Yushan Park is home to indigenous Formosan black bears, an endangered species
subject to strict protection, and the Italian park is a key natural habitat of
brown bears, contributing to the animal's survival in the Alps.</P>
      <P>Chen and Zulberti exchanged specially designed gifts featuring the two protected
bear species to highlight the importance of wildlife conservation and protection
of their natural habitats.</P>
      <P>"As both are high-elevation nature parks, we have much to learn from each
other," Chen said at the signing ceremony.</P>
      <P>Located in the Italian Alps northeast of Milan, the 620.57-square kilometer
Adamello Brenta Nature Park comprises the Adamello and Brenta mountain groups,
which stand 400 meters to 3,500 meters high.</P>
      <P>Its unique ecosystem comprises forests, plateaus, and glaciers that host a
wealth of wildlife species.</P>
      <P>It is high on the UNESCO list of "geological"  parks -- territories  that
encompass  one or more sites  of scientific importance, not only for geological
reasons but also for its archaeological, ecological or cultural values.</P>
      <P>Chen said his office will draw from the Italian park's experience in applying
for UNESCO recognition as a geopark. "We believe our park stands a chance to win
a spot on the UNESCO list, " he said confidently.</P>
      <P>Zulberti said he quickly gained an appreciation for Yushan National Park's rich
natural resources and diverse climate zones and topography after touring the
area.</P>
      <P>In the future, the Italian park administrator said he hopes the two parks will
cooperate in educational, cultural and conservation initiatives.</P>
      <P>Zulberti and Claudio Ferrari, a department chief at the Adamello Brenta Nature
Park administration, arrived in Taiwan over the weekend for the signing
ceremony.</P>
      <P>With help from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Homer C. Wu, a professor  at
National  Taichung  University,  the Yushan park administration has been in
constant contact with the Italian park for nearly a year.</P>

      <P>Nineteen Taiwanese business groups ranging from telecom and communication
commodities to household appliances signed up Monday for a voluntary energy-
saving program that will help cut energy consumption by 5 percent in three
years.</P>
      <P>The Bureau of Energy, which is organizing the program, hopes it will help reduce
33,000 tons of carbon dioxide emissions and 53 million kilowatt-hours of
electricity in three years, as well as create NT$450 million (US$14.19 million)
-worth of green industry business opportunities.</P>
      <P>"Despite  having  been labeled  as a successful  case of development, Taiwan's
economic achievements have actually resulted from the previous low costs of
manpower, land and capital, " Vice Premier Sean C. Chen said at the signing
ceremony.</P>
      <P>According to the vice premier, the low cost of Taiwan's economic development
included costs to the environment,  however.  The government has held related
programs to reach the goals of energy saving and carbon reduction, achieving
negative growth in national energy consumption of minus 2.84 percent in 2008
compared to 2007 and minus 2.85 percent in 2009 compared with the previous year.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, Minister of Economic Affairs Shih Yen-shiang
provided additional statistics to prove the worth of related investments.</P>
      <P>Shih said that since 2006, the Bureau of Energy has signed energy-saving
agreements with convenience stores,  wholesalers, supermarkets,  department
stores, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels, amounting to a total of NT$3
billion in energy-saving investment and leading to savings of NT$1.5 billion in
electricity costs annually.</P>
      <P>He said that a total of over 1,700 stores in the telecom, communication and
consumer electronics sectors invest NT$450 million in energy-saving facilities
each year, representing the equivalent of 50 million kilowatt-hours of
electricity saved.</P>
      <P>Shih also stressed that the government should improve the nation's energy
efficiency by over 2 percent each year and should make every effort to increase
the efficiency in 2025 by 50 percent compared to the 2005 figure. Carbon dioxide
emissions, meanwhile, should be reduced to the level of 2000 by 2025 and further
reduced to 50 percent by 2050.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of National Defense (MND) on Monday denied a newspaper report that
said Taiwan's hopes of procuring diesel electric submarines and F-16 C/D jet
fighters from the United States have dimmed as China has brought intense
pressure to bear against the plan.</P>
      <P>"The report was not true," the MND said in a press statement. "We have never
received any U.S. notice saying it would cease arms sales to Taiwan, nor have we
ever come to any conclusion that the U.S. would stop mulling the two deals."</P>
      <P>The statement further stressed that the military has never wavered on its policy
and stance on purchasing U.S.-built weapons.</P>
      <P>The Liberty Times reported Monday that Taiwan's intelligence units have
concluded that long-term efforts to buy eight submarines and 66 F-16 C/Ds have
almost proved futile due to Beijing's strong opposition and that the only viable
alternative would be taking up the U. S. offer to help Taiwan upgrade its fleet
of F-16 A/Bs.</P>
      <P>The paper also quoted unidentified naval sources as saying that it remains to be
seen whether Taiwan's government has the mettle to build smaller submarines on
its own.</P>

U.S. to replace its aging F-5E/Fs, which are scheduled to be retired this year.</P>

      <P>About 30 Pingpu tribespeople gathered in front of the Presidential Office on the
United Nations' International Day of the World's Indigenous People Monday,
calling on President Ma Ying-jeou to recognize Pingpu people as aboriginals.</P>
      <P>Escorted by police officers, 10 of the protesters entered the Presidential
Office to deliver a petition to President Ma Ying-jeou after participating in an
ancestor worship ceremony at Ketagalan Boulevard in front of the presidential
building.</P>
      <P>Historian Lin Sheng-yi, who heads the Ketagalan of Taiwan Indigenous Culture
Alliance, said that in addition to petitioning for official  recognition  of the
tribes,  they also demanded the restoration of a 4,400-year-old Ketagalan
historical site in Gongliao in Taipei County and an investigation into the
destruction of the site.</P>
      <P>Ketagalan are a Taiwanese aboriginal tribe originating in what is now the Taipei
Basin.</P>
      <P>The aborigines also called for a halt to land expropriation and development in
the northeast coastal area and a wetlands area in Tianliaoyang  in  Taipei
County  to ensure  conservation  and biodiversity.</P>
      <P>Jason Pan,  director of the Taiwan Association for Rights Advancements for
Pingpu Plains Aborigines, who represented the tribe at a U.N. meeting last
month, displayed a conference registration card from the meeting and asked:
"Even the U.N. recognizes our status, how can the ROC government refuse to do
so?"</P>
      <P>The protesters also urged the government to establish a Pingpu Aboriginal
Affairs Committee to handle the affairs of the tribes.</P>
      <P>Because of historical factors, many Pingpu Aborigines failed to register their
aboriginal status and are not officially recognized, according to the Ministry
of the Interior.</P>
      <P>Opposition Democratic Progressive Party Legislator Tien Chiu- chin suggested

      <P>Having a member of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) run as an
independent in the Kaohsiung municipality mayoral election will remind voters of
the DPP's closed-door policy on trade and the economy, a spokesman for the
ruling Kuomintang (KMT) contended Monday.</P>
      <P>The candidacy of Kaohsiung County Magistrate Yang Chiu-hsing as an independent
"is not a bad thing for the 'pan-blue' alliance," said spokesman Su Jun-pin,
referring to pro-KMT supporters.</P>
      <P>Some KMT members believe Yang's candidacy will help the ruling party because he
will likely propose views that differ from what the KMT describes as the DPP's
closed-door and restrictive policy approach on trade and commercial relations
between Taiwan and China, Su said.</P>
      <P>His arguments could help buttress the positions of KMT nominees in the five
municipality elections (including the one in Kaohsiung) taking place on Nov. 27
and shield them from "false claims" made by the DPP on the issue, Su argued.</P>
      <P>The DPP has frequently accused the KMT government of sacrificing Taiwan's
sovereignty and the interests of local workers and farmers in pursuing closer
ties with China, charges that the ruling KMT adamantly rejects.</P>
      <P>Yang officially announced on Monday that he will quit the DPP and run as an
independent for mayor of the newly created Kaohsiung municipality, to be formed
by the merger of his Kaohsiung County and Kaohsiung City.</P>
      <P>He will run against the DPP's official nominee, Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu, and
KMT Legislator Huang Chao-shun. Initial polls showed Yang and Huang trailing
Chen by a wide margin in a three-way race.</P>
      <P>Though Su suggested the KMT could benefit from Yang's candidacy, some KMT
members are worried that Yang could draw support from "non-DPP" voters in
Kaohsiung and pull votes away from the KMT's Huang.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chen appeared to take Yang's announcement in stride, saying she
respected his decision. She said her team will work hard and conduct an "honest
fight" with her opponents.</P>
      <P>Yang may not be the only DPP political leader who will defy the party and run in
the November mayoral elections, which will also take place in Taipei City,
Xinbei City (Taipei County's new name after it is upgraded to a municipality) ,
Taichung (Taichung County and City) and Tainan (Tainan County and City).</P>
      <P>Incumbent Tainan City Mayor Hsu Tain-tsair has also hinted at running as an
independent in the Tainan race after losing the DPP primary there earlier this
year. He said he plans to announce his intentions in mid-August.</P>
      <P>Hsu was asked on Monday if he will follow Yang's move, but he declined comment.</P>
      <P>The Tainan mayor did, however, reiterate previous criticism of the DPP's primary

announcing his bid.</P>

      <P>Fifteen years into his battle with cancer, Chiu Te-cheng still has the burning
passion for inventing that has helped distract him from the burden of his

      <P>The 72-year-old former truck driver, a high risk candidate for cancer because he

      <P>He said his wife used to buy him fresh coconut water from vendors who used
unsanitary knives, and he decided to apply his previous knowledge of jade
processing to improve the knives the vendors used.</P>
      <P>The knife he developed was eventually patented in 2001 and manufactured in large
quantities after winning the recognition of international investors.</P>
      <P>Six years later, a 2-centimeter tumor in his left kidney brought him back to the

time to inventing a special fruit knife that prevents bacterial infection.</P>
      <P>The product earned him a patent in 2009 and a silver medal at the Taipei

      <P>Menno Goedhart, the Netherlands' de facto ambassador to Taiwan, became an
honorary citizen of Kaohsiung as he took up the post of the city's first
European "tourism ambassador" on Monday.</P>
      <P>The city government said it hopes Goedhart will help forge a closer friendship
between the Netherlands and Taiwan and draw more European people to Taiwan and
the southern harbor city of Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>The outgoing Dutch envoy, known for his love of Taiwan, has publicly announced
that he and his wife will live in Tainan County, also in southern Taiwan, after
his retirement in August.</P>
      <P>Since posted in Taiwan in 2002, Goedhart has traveled many places around the
country to trace the footprints of his ancestors, who held a colonial capital on
the island between 1624 and 1662.</P>
      <P>During that period, some Dutch citizens married local aborigines, mostly from
the Rukai tribe. In 2009, Goedhart visited Pingtung County's Wutai Township
along with nearly 40 Dutch people residing in Taiwan, leading them to meet the
descendants of the mixed marriages.</P>
      <P>With his close friendship with the tribe, Goedhart was even made an honorary
chieftain under the name Ama Daganau.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taichung City Mayor Jason Hu pledged Monday to help farmers, food processors,
restaurant owners and hotel operators obtain halal certification to help them
attract Muslim customers.</P>
      <P>Hu, who recently headed a delegation of officials and businessmen from Taichung
City and County to Malaysia and Indonesia, said halal certification can help
local companies reach out to more than 20 Muslim countries with a combined
population of over 1.5 billion.</P>
      <P>Getting a food product halal-certified means it conforms to Islamic law and can
be ingested by Muslims.</P>
      <P>Hu said a snack made from ponkan mandarin oranges grown in Taichung County has
enjoyed brisk sales in Malaysia after acquiring halal certification earlier this
year.</P>
      <P>According to Hu, foodstuffs carrying halal certification issued by Malaysian
religious authorities  can be sold in 24 Muslim countries, but those with halal
certification issued by the Taichung Mosque can only be offered in a few Muslim
countries.</P>
      <P>Hu said Taiwan's representative office in Malaysia has collected extensive
information on how to help local food processors obtain halal certification.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese food processors may also set up factories in Malaysia to facilitate
their attempts to penetrate Muslim markets, he added.</P>
      <P>With increasing numbers of people from Malaysia and Indonesia visiting Taichung
on vacation, Hu said, the city government is also encouraging  local restaurants
and hotels to apply for halal certification to help attract Muslim visitors.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Three agencies under the Executive Yuan filed appeals Monday against three
Taiwan High Administrative Court rulings that temporarily suspended the
development of the Central Taiwan Science Park's Houli Park in Miaoli County and
Erlin Park in Changhua County.</P>
      <P>The appeals  were  filed  by the Environmental  Protection Administration (EPA)
, the National Science Council and the Central Taiwan Science Park
Administration -- all three of which were targets of the court's orders.</P>
      <P>National Science Council Deputy Minister Jou Jing-yang said in a news conference
that the appeals are very likely to reverse court rulings handed down on July
30.</P>
      <P>"The rulings obviously went beyond what is necessary and failed to take into
account the damages it would cause to public interest, " Jou said.</P>
      <P>"The provisional injunctions were supposed to prevent major damage or to avoid
immediate disasters that simply are not factors in these cases," he added.</P>
      <P>"It is our view that the development of these two parks won't lead to any major
negative impact, but the court didn't take into account the evidence and
arguments from the National Science Council and the Central Taiwan Science Park
Administration," Jou said.</P>
      <P>At the request of local environmentalists, the Taiwan High Administrative Court
ordered the EPA, the National Science Council and the Central Taiwan Science
Park Administration to suspend the development of Houli Park and Erlin Park.</P>
      <P>The court ruled that environmental impact assessments had not been carried out
properly and halted all work on the project until new assessments could be made.</P>
      <P>The orders to halt work at Houli Park came in two rulings -- one against the EPA
and the park administration, and a second ruling against the science council.</P>
      <P>The ruling caused alarm among companies already engaged in production at Houli
Park, especially AU Optronics Corp., which has almost completed two TFT-LCD
factories in the park at a price of NT$200 billion (US$6.29 billion).</P>
      <P>The companies  urged Premier Wu Den-yih  to sort out the differences  between
the executive  and judicial branches  and threatened to hold the government
responsible for any losses incurred from the suspension of work.</P>
      <P>No companies have begun operations in Erlin Park, which is still on the drawing
board, but the EPA and the park administration also jointly appealed the court
injunction on it Monday.</P>
      <P>Jou said that although it would take the Supreme Administrative Court three to
six months to rule on the appeals, work at Houli Park is expected to resume if a
new environmental impact assessment required by the court is completed this
month.</P>
      <P>When asked about losses that companies in Houli Park could suffer because of the
court's order, Jou said only that damages have not yet been incurred.</P>
      <P>Vice Premier Sean C. Chen said on a separate occasion Monday that he is
optimistic that the rulings will be reversed by appeals.</P>
      <P>At a news conference organized by the Ministry of the Economic Affairs to push
for cuts in carbon dioxide emissions, the vice premier said the executive branch
has not yet asked companies operating in Houli Park to stop production as
ordered by the Taiwan High Administrative Court.</P>
      <P>"Sticking to the law and taking all factors into account are the principles we
are following in dealing with the issue." Chen said. "We attach equal importance
to environment protection and economic development, and are trying to balance
one with the other."</P>
      <P>Noting that the Taiwan High Administrative Court based its rulings on Article
298 of the Administrative Litigation Act, Chen said that Article 299 of the same
act exempts the executive branch -- which includes the EPA -- from provisional
injunctions based on Article 298.</P>
      <P>The vice premier said the administrative court's power is limited to examining
whether the executive branch's measures were taken with due process of law, not
to judge whether the measures meet the purposes for which they are taken.</P>
      <P>"However, the Taiwan High Administrative Court seemed to issue a ruling over the
propriety of the executive measures in the guise of a ruling on their legality,"
Chen said.</P>
      <P>The appeal will provide the Supreme Administrative Court a chance to draw a
clear line between the two and set a guideline for the executive branch to
follow, Chen said.</P>
      <P>The Central Taiwan Science Park is one of three science parks in the country.
They turned out combined products worth NT$1.96 trillion and employed more than
200,000 people in 2007.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's exports are expected to hit a record high this year after reaching
US$23.9 billion in July, the second highest monthly total since the global
credit tsunami in late 2008 triggered an economic meltdown.</P>
      <P>Exports in July were 38.5 percent higher than the same period a year earlier
while imports rose 42.7 percent to US$21.74 billion, said Lin Li-chen, the chief
statistician of the Ministry of Finance.</P>
      <P>For the first seven months of the year, exports rose 47.4 percent year-on-year
to US$155.82 billion, while imports were up 61 percent compared to the same
period last year to US$141.73 billion, she said.</P>
      <P>The statistician attributed the strong growth to the global economic recovery,
especially in Asia.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's exports in the first seven months of the year to China, Hong Kong, the
biggest six Association of Southeast Asian Nations members, Japan and South
Korea, were the highest on record.</P>
      <P>With the International Monetary Fund revising its forecast for global growth in
2010 upward to 4.6 percent, and Taiwan's exports usually stronger in the second
half of the year, Lin estimated exports for the year would total US$272.98
billion, which would far exceed the previous annual high of US$255.6 billion in
2008.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Cheng Cheng-mount, chief economist with Citibank Taiwan, predicted
that exports would grow by 5 percent to 15 percent in the third quarter.</P>
      <P>Yang Chia-Yan, director of the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research's Research
Division VI, said the prospects for exports should be bright if Taiwan's
currency does not appreciate too much in value.</P>

      <P>Taking advantage of a month without typhoons, more tourists visited the outlying
Green Island in July than in any month in history, according to the East Coast
National Scenic Area Administration.</P>
      <P>"On weekend or holiday nights, people could hardly move among the crowds on the
streets of Nanliao Village, " said Yi Ming-chao, the director of the Green
Island administration office.</P>
      <P>Yi attributed the strong numbers to the economic recovery along with the
combination of hot weather and the absence of typhoons, which made Green
Island's water activities more attractive to visitors.</P>
      <P>According to the administration, a total of 78,338 tourists visited the island
in July, an average of roughly 2,500 per day, with 5,000 arriving on July 10
alone.</P>
      <P>Tourists have often been kept away from Green Island during the summer by the
threat of typhoons. When typhoons hit the area, ferries connecting Green Island

      <P>About 30 Pingpu tribespeople gathered in front of the Presidential Office on the
United Nations' International Day of the World's Indigenous People Monday,
calling on President Ma Ying-jeou to recognize Pingpu people as aboriginals.</P>
      <P>Escorted by police officers, 10 of the protesters entered the Presidential
Office to deliver a petition to President Ma Ying-jeou after participating in an
ancestor worship ceremony at Ketagalan Boulevard in front of the presidential
building.</P>
      <P>Historian Lin Sheng-yi, who heads the Ketagalan of Taiwan Indigenous Culture
Alliance, said that in addition to petitioning for official  recognition  of the
tribes,  they also demanded the restoration of a 4,400-year-old Ketagalan
historical site in Gongliao in Taipei County and an investigation into the
destruction of the site.</P>
      <P>Ketagalan are a Taiwanese aboriginal tribe originating in what is now the Taipei
Basin.</P>
      <P>The aborigines also called for a halt to land expropriation and development in
the northeast coastal area and a wetlands area in Tianliaoyang  in  Taipei
County  to ensure  conservation  and biodiversity.</P>
      <P>Jason Pan,  director of the Taiwan Association for Rights Advancements for
Pingpu Plains Aborigines, who represented the tribe at a U.N. meeting last
month, displayed a conference registration card from the meeting and asked:
"Even the U.N. recognizes our status, how can the ROC government refuse to do
so?"</P>
      <P>The protesters also urged the government to establish a Pingpu Aboriginal
Affairs Committee to handle the affairs of the tribes.</P>
      <P>Because of historical factors, many Pingpu Aborigines failed to register their
aboriginal status and are not officially recognized, according to the Ministry
of the Interior.</P>
      <P>Opposition Democratic Progressive Party Legislator Tien Chiu- chin suggested
that the government respond to a request by the Siraya tribe, a plains tribe
whose families were registered as "cooked (integrated) " during the Japanese
occupation of Taiwan,  and recognize them as "low-land aboriginals."</P>

      <P>Menno Goedhart, the Netherlands' de facto ambassador to Taiwan, became an
honorary citizen of Kaohsiung as he took up the post of the city's first
European "tourism ambassador" on Monday.</P>
      <P>The city government said it hopes Goedhart will help forge a closer friendship
between the Netherlands and Taiwan and draw more European people to Taiwan and
the southern harbor city of Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>The outgoing Dutch envoy, known for his love of Taiwan, has publicly announced
that he and his wife will live in Tainan County, also in southern Taiwan, after
his retirement in August.</P>
      <P>Since posted in Taiwan in 2002, Goedhart has traveled many places around the
country to trace the footprints of his ancestors, who held a colonial capital on
the island between 1624 and 1662.</P>
      <P>During that period, some Dutch citizens married local aborigines, mostly from
the Rukai tribe. In 2009, Goedhart visited Pingtung County's Wutai Township
along with nearly 40 Dutch people residing in Taiwan, leading them to meet the
descendants of the mixed marriages.</P>
      <P>With his close friendship with the tribe, Goedhart was even made an honorary
chieftain under the name Ama Daganau.</P>
      <P>Goedhart compiled his travel notes from the past eight years into a book titled
"The Real Taiwan and the Dutch: Traveling Notes from the Netherlands
Representative, " which was published in both English and Chinese in Taiwan
April 19.</P>

      <P>Taichung City Mayor Jason Hu pledged Monday to help farmers, food processors,
restaurant owners and hotel operators obtain halal certification to help them
attract Muslim customers.</P>
      <P>Hu, who recently headed a delegation of officials and businessmen from Taichung
City and County to Malaysia and Indonesia, said halal certification can help
local companies reach out to more than 20 Muslim countries with a combined
population of over 1.5 billion.</P>
      <P>Getting a food product halal-certified means it conforms to Islamic law and can
be ingested by Muslims.</P>
      <P>Hu said a snack made from ponkan mandarin oranges grown in Taichung County has
enjoyed brisk sales in Malaysia after acquiring halal certification earlier this
year.</P>
      <P>According to Hu, foodstuffs carrying halal certification issued by Malaysian
religious authorities  can be sold in 24 Muslim countries, but those with halal
certification issued by the Taichung Mosque can only be offered in a few Muslim
countries.</P>
      <P>Hu said Taiwan's representative office in Malaysia has collected extensive
information on how to help local food processors obtain halal certification.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese food processors may also set up factories in Malaysia to facilitate
their attempts to penetrate Muslim markets, he added.</P>
      <P>With increasing numbers of people from Malaysia and Indonesia visiting Taichung
on vacation, Hu said, the city government is also encouraging  local restaurants
and hotels to apply for halal certification to help attract Muslim visitors.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Three agencies under the Executive Yuan filed appeals Monday against three
Taiwan High Administrative Court rulings that temporarily suspended the
development of the Central Taiwan Science Park's Houli Park in Miaoli County and
Erlin Park in Changhua County.</P>
      <P>The appeals  were  filed  by the Environmental  Protection Administration (EPA)
, the National Science Council and the Central Taiwan Science Park
Administration -- all three of which were targets of the court's orders.</P>
      <P>National Science Council Deputy Minister Jou Jing-yang said in a news conference
that the appeals are very likely to reverse court rulings handed down on July
30.</P>
      <P>"The rulings obviously went beyond what is necessary and failed to take into
account the damages it would cause to public interest, " Jou said.</P>
      <P>"The provisional injunctions were supposed to prevent major damage or to avoid
immediate disasters that simply are not factors in these cases," he added.</P>
      <P>"It is our view that the development of these two parks won't lead to any major
negative impact, but the court didn't take into account the evidence and
arguments from the National Science Council and the Central Taiwan Science Park
Administration," Jou said.</P>
      <P>At the request of local environmentalists, the Taiwan High Administrative Court
ordered the EPA, the National Science Council and the Central Taiwan Science
Park Administration to suspend the development of Houli Park and Erlin Park.</P>
      <P>The court ruled that environmental impact assessments had not been carried out
properly and halted all work on the project until new assessments could be made.</P>
      <P>The orders to halt work at Houli Park came in two rulings -- one against the EPA
and the park administration, and a second ruling against the science council.</P>
      <P>The ruling caused alarm among companies already engaged in production at Houli
Park, especially AU Optronics Corp., which has almost completed two TFT-LCD
factories in the park at a price of NT$200 billion (US$6.29 billion).</P>
      <P>The companies  urged Premier Wu Den-yih  to sort out the differences  between
the executive  and judicial branches  and threatened to hold the government
responsible for any losses incurred from the suspension of work.</P>
      <P>No companies have begun operations in Erlin Park, which is still on the drawing
board, but the EPA and the park administration also jointly appealed the court
injunction on it Monday.</P>
      <P>Jou said that although it would take the Supreme Administrative Court three to
six months to rule on the appeals, work at Houli Park is expected to resume if a
new environmental impact assessment required by the court is completed this
month.</P>
      <P>When asked about losses that companies in Houli Park could suffer because of the
court's order, Jou said only that damages have not yet been incurred.</P>
      <P>Vice Premier Sean C. Chen said on a separate occasion Monday that he is
optimistic that the rulings will be reversed by appeals.</P>
      <P>At a news conference organized by the Ministry of the Economic Affairs to push
for cuts in carbon dioxide emissions, the vice premier said the executive branch
has not yet asked companies operating in Houli Park to stop production as
ordered by the Taiwan High Administrative Court.</P>
      <P>"Sticking to the law and taking all factors into account are the principles we
are following in dealing with the issue." Chen said. "We attach equal importance
to environment protection and economic development, and are trying to balance
one with the other."</P>
      <P>Noting that the Taiwan High Administrative Court based its rulings on Article
298 of the Administrative Litigation Act, Chen said that Article 299 of the same
act exempts the executive branch -- which includes the EPA -- from provisional
injunctions based on Article 298.</P>
      <P>The vice premier said the administrative court's power is limited to examining
whether the executive branch's measures were taken with due process of law, not
to judge whether the measures meet the purposes for which they are taken.</P>
      <P>"However, the Taiwan High Administrative Court seemed to issue a ruling over the
propriety of the executive measures in the guise of a ruling on their legality,"
Chen said.</P>
      <P>The appeal will provide the Supreme Administrative Court a chance to draw a
clear line between the two and set a guideline for the executive branch to
follow, Chen said.</P>
      <P>The Central Taiwan Science Park is one of three science parks in the country.
They turned out combined products worth NT$1.96 trillion and employed more than
200,000 people in 2007.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's exports are expected to hit a record high this year after reaching
US$23.9 billion in July, the second highest monthly total since the global
credit tsunami in late 2008 triggered an economic meltdown.</P>
      <P>Exports in July were 38.5 percent higher than the same period a year earlier
while imports rose 42.7 percent to US$21.74 billion, said Lin Li-chen, the chief
statistician of the Ministry of Finance.</P>
      <P>For the first seven months of the year, exports rose 47.4 percent year-on-year
to US$155.82 billion, while imports were up 61 percent compared to the same
period last year to US$141.73 billion, she said.</P>
      <P>The statistician attributed the strong growth to the global economic recovery,
especially in Asia.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's exports in the first seven months of the year to China, Hong Kong, the
biggest six Association of Southeast Asian Nations members, Japan and South
Korea, were the highest on record.</P>
      <P>With the International Monetary Fund revising its forecast for global growth in
2010 upward to 4.6 percent, and Taiwan's exports usually stronger in the second
half of the year, Lin estimated exports for the year would total US$272.98
billion, which would far exceed the previous annual high of US$255.6 billion in
2008.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Cheng Cheng-mount, chief economist with Citibank Taiwan, predicted
that exports would grow by 5 percent to 15 percent in the third quarter.</P>
      <P>Yang Chia-Yan, director of the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research's Research
Division VI, said the prospects for exports should be bright if Taiwan's
currency does not appreciate too much in value.</P>

      <P>Taking advantage of a month without typhoons, more tourists visited the outlying
Green Island in July than in any month in history, according to the East Coast
National Scenic Area Administration.</P>
      <P>"On weekend or holiday nights, people could hardly move among the crowds on the
streets of Nanliao Village, " said Yi Ming-chao, the director of the Green
Island administration office.</P>
      <P>Yi attributed the strong numbers to the economic recovery along with the
combination of hot weather and the absence of typhoons, which made Green
Island's water activities more attractive to visitors.</P>
      <P>According to the administration, a total of 78,338 tourists visited the island
in July, an average of roughly 2,500 per day, with 5,000 arriving on July 10
alone.</P>
      <P>Tourists have often been kept away from Green Island during the summer by the
threat of typhoons. When typhoons hit the area, ferries connecting Green Island

      <P>Kaohsiung County Magistrate Yang Chiu-hsiung announced Monday his decision to
quit the opposition Democratic Progressive Party to run for mayor in the
Kaohsiung special municipality.</P>
      <P>Since Yang began preparing for a mayoral bid without his party's nomination, he
has made a number of public remarks that veer from his long-standing positions,
an apparent attempt to distinguish himself from the DPP's nominee Chen Chu.</P>
      <P>It is necessary for us to strictly examine such flip-flopping by politicians.</P>
      <P>Yang claims to follow a "middle-of-the-way policy" to stand by the majority of
the people, but his interpretation of what this policy means is extremely
disappointing. He said Taiwan should adjust its relations with China and should
not always confront China.</P>
      <P>This demonstrates that Yang lacks basic common sense when it comes to the impact
of cross-Taiwan Strait trade liberalization on Taiwan's disadvantaged class and
wealth distribution, with voters in southern Taiwan the most immediate victims.</P>
      <P>The year-end elections in the five special municipalities will be a battle to
defend Taiwan, which is an issue concerning national interests. Any politicians
who ignore this situation will be isolated from the majority. (Editorial

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Kaohsiung County Magistrate Yang Chiu-hsing formally threw his hat into the ring
in the Kaohsiung municipality mayoral race as an independent Monday, with
pledges to help the greater Kaohsiung area overtake the thriving city state of
Singapore.</P>
      <P>Yang, a longtime Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) stalwart, also  said  he
hopes  his electoral  bid will  motivate  the pro-independence party to
pragmatically deal with relations across the Taiwan Strait and come to recognize
that ties with China should no longer be confrontational.</P>
      <P>His remarks were seen as a gesture to woo supporters of the ruling Kuomintang-
led "pan-blue" camp, which generally favors a China-friendly policy line.</P>
      <P>Political observers were divided on the potential impact of Yang's action. Some
predicted that Yang's move signaled a shift in factional alliances and forces
within both the blue and green camps ahead of the 2012 presidential election,
citing as an example a major pro-KMT political faction in the Kaohsiung area
throwing its support to the DPP's official candidate, incumbent Kaohsiung City
Mayor Chen Chu, rather than to her KMT rival.</P>
      <P>Other analysts, however, saw Yang's revolt as an ominous sign of the DPP's
failure to consolidate its ranks. They believe that if he were to make a strong
showing in the November election, it could reshape Taiwan's political landscape.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from local media coverage of Yang's gambit:</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>In an attempt to ease the apprehension of its supporters over the impact of
Yang's move on the party's political fate, the DPP on Monday unveiled the
results of its latest survey that shows its official candidate receiving
majority support even in a three-way race.</P>
      <P>The Aug. 6 telephone poll of 1,482 adults in Kaohsiung City and County that will
form the new Kaohsiung special municipality later this year found that Chen has
a 53 percent support rate, compared to Yang's 22 percent and Huang's 15 percent.</P>
      <P>Analyzing the poll results, Chen Chun-lin, director of the DPP's public opinion
survey center, said the KMT candidate rather than the DPP's will be most
affected by Yang's electoral bid.</P>
      <P>According  to the poll,  an overwhelming  80.8 percent of "pan-green" supporters
will back Chen Chu, compared to the 15.8 percent who said they will vote for
Yang.</P>
      <P>Among swing or non-partisan voters, 45.2 percent said they would back Chen, 20.4
percent said they would support Yang, and 9.3 percent voiced support for Huang.</P>
      <P>While Huang emerged as the top vote-getter among "pan-blue" supporters, the
support rate was only 38.5 percent, a number only slightly higher than Yang's
34.2 percent.</P>
      <P>Even Chen managed to receive the support of 23.9 percent of "pan-blue"
supporters, Chen Chun-lin said.</P>
      <P>Political analysts said Yang's defiant move poses new challenges to both the DPP
and the KMT.</P>
      <P>The DPP must prevent the ripple of Yang's split from spreading to other
constituencies, whereas the KMT must win back its core supporters to avoid being
trounced in the region. (Aug. 10, 2010).</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>Yang said in an interview with this paper after announcing his mayoral bid that
he no longer sees eye to eye with the DPP on China policy.</P>
      <P>"More than a decade ago, I often shouted the slogan 'Taiwan, China, one side,
one country.' But times have changed, and we must get a bit more pragmatic, "
Yang said. He said that since taking office as Kaohsiung County magistrate nine
years ago, he has moved closer to a "middle-of-the-road" stance.</P>
      <P>In the face of China's rise as a new economic power, Yang said a small country
like Taiwan cannot afford to confront such a big neighbor and should instead

      <P>If elected, Yang said, he will promote exchanges with major Chinese cities under
the premise that Taiwan's sovereignty will not be compromised.</P>
      <P>In contrast to the DPP's opposition to the recently signed cross-strait economic
cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) , Yang said he conditionally supports the
pact. "Without such an accord, Taiwan will become an isolated island," he said.
(Aug. 10, 2010). Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>Disappointed by Yang's challenge to the DPP's nomination policy, pro-
Taiwanization activists on the Kaohsiung County government's advisory team
resigned en masse Monday.</P>
      <P>The activists issued a joint statement criticizing  Yang's about-face on the
ECFA, saying Yang was pursuing personal interests at the expense of Taiwan's
overall well-being. (Aug. 10, 2010).</P>

      <P>There is a saying that goes: "He who wants to climb the ladder must begin at the
bottom." We want to use this proverb to remind the government to strengthen its
command of the basics when pushing its global investment promotion plan.</P>
      <P>The first basic element of investment is land acquisition. However,  there are
currently 1,500 hectares of idle land in industrial parks around the country,
which suggests that accurately gauging the demand for land among potential
investors is a more important basic task.</P>
      <P>Before heading abroad on investment promotion missions, the officials involved
should first do their homework on such basic issues as which of "10 flagship
projects" will be singled out for their trips, which potential investors will be
targeted, and if there are any barriers in existing laws and regulations that
need to be addressed.</P>
      <P>Another basic task is to visit foreign investors who are already in Taiwan and
invite them to take part in Taiwan's "10 flagship projects." (Editorial abstract

    <TEXT>
      <P>Personal computer firm AsusTek Computer Inc. had sales at the 2010 Taipei
Computer Applications Show that were 30 percent higher than a year earlier on
stronger sales of notebook computers.</P>
      <P>"We saw sales at the five-day computer exhibition hit NT$150 million (US$4.74
million) , up about 30 percent from last year's event, " Jose Liao, AsusTek
senior product manager, told the Central News Agency.</P>
      <P>"The increase in sales was the result of the launch of new ultra-thin notebook
computer models to stimulate buying," Liao said.</P>
      <P>The computer applications  show attracted a record 640,000 visitors during its
run from Aug. 5-9, a 10 percent higher turnout than a year earlier,  according
to the Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA), the organizer of the
trade show.</P>
      <P>During the show, AsusTek sold about 7,000 notebook computers, or one almost
"every 30 minutes, " with its new U-series laptops proving particularly popular,
according to TAITRA.</P>
      <P>AsusTek said its desktop computers, LCD displays, LED displays and navigation
cell phones also attracted interest.</P>
      <P>On Monday, AsusTek reported that its sales in July rose 11.8 percent from June
to NT$23.07 billion, in contrast to rival computer makers that reported double-
digit month-on-month declines in July revenues.</P>
      <P>Quanta Computer posted NT$86.19 billion in July sales, down 14 percent from
June, and Wistron Corp. had NT$48.97 billion in sales last month, down 12.8
percent from a month earlier.</P>
      <P>Mars Hsu, an analyst with Grand Cathay Securities, said sales of AsusTek's
motherboards remained strong, helping offset declines in notebook computer
demand.</P>
      <P>Quanta and Wistron serve as OEM manufacturers for top global notebook computer
vendors, while AsusTek spun off its manufacturing arm in the first half of this
year to focus on building its own brand.</P>
      <P>Goldman Sachs has lowered its forecast for shipment growth of the global
notebook computer sector for the third quarter of this year to 5 percent from 9
percent.</P>
      <P>The investment bank said top global notebook computer vendors have cut their
orders to their OEM suppliers, leading to declines in sales by those OEM
companies in July.</P>
      <P>"The expected weaker demand in the third quarter reflects a slower pace of
global economic growth, " said Joanne Chien, head of research at Digitimes.</P>
      <P>Chien said "back to school" sales in Europe and the United States are worse than
expected, and she believed the market also expects Christmas season sales to be
less than satisfactory because of declining economic fundamentals.</P>

      <P>Taiwanese singing sensation Lin Yu-chun arrived in Los Angeles Monday to make an
appearance on the popular CBS talent scout show "America's Got Talent."</P>
      <P>Lin, who vaulted to fame in April with his rendition of the Whitney Houston
version of "I Will Always Love You" on a Taiwanese talent show, said he was very
happy to have been invited to sing in the widely acclaimed TV program.</P>
      <P>"It's great that my effort has drawn the attention of U.S. media, and their
interest has motivated me to work even harder, " Lin told reporters after his
arrival.</P>
      <P>This is his third visit to Los Angeles in less than half a year.</P>
      <P>He first visited the city in April to appear on two talk-variety shows, The
Ellen DeGeneres Show and Lopez Tonight. His renditions of several popular songs
during those two appearances  captivated American audiences.</P>
      <P>He was back in the city in May to perform at Dodger Stadium in a "This Is My
Town" promotion run by the Los Angeles Dodgers honoring Taiwanese fans.</P>
      <P>"Although this is my third visit, I'm still very excited and feel kind of
nervous, " the 24-year-old singer said. He will stay in his hotel to practice
the songs he plans to sing on the CBS show.</P>
      <P>During his visit, Lin will also meet with Walter Afanasieff, a Grammy Awards-
winning record producer and sing "Under Your Wings" -- a song Afanasieff has
written for Lin -- in public for the first time.</P>
      <P>On his rise to stardom from out of nowhere, Lin said it was because of his
sudden fame that he will actually work harder, not only so that more Taiwanese
get to know him but also to help more foreigners get to know Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lin, nicknamed "chubby" for his weight, vaulted to fame after a video showing
him singing "I Will Always Love You" was posted on YouTube on April 6.</P>
      <P>The clip, from his performance on a Taiwanese talent show called "Million Star,
" immediately went viral and quickly brought him intensive media coverage in
Taiwan.</P>

      <P>Taiwan share prices closed down 0.71 Tuesday as investors pocketed profit after
the index rose above the key 8,000 point mark in the previous session, dealers
said.</P>
      <P>The weighted index fell 57.75 points to 7,976.74, after moving between 7,975.38
and 8,054.29 on turnover of NT$135.67 billion (US$4.28 billion).</P>
      <P>The market opened up 0.25 percent on Wall Street's gains overnight, but profit
taking followed immediately, focusing on old economy stocks which had benefited
from recent rotational buying, dealers said.</P>
      <P>The high tech sector remained weak as worse-than-expected July sales data among
notebook computer and flat panel makers cemented the market fears of slower
demand in the third quarter of this year, dealers said.</P>
      <P>A total of 2,442 stocks closed down and 1,260 up, while 239 remained unchanged.</P>
      <P>The textile sector suffered the heaviest pressure, falling 1.9 percent. The
foodstuff and construction sectors closed down 1.1 percent, and the machinery
and electronics and financial sectors all finished 1.0 percent lower.</P>
      <P>The cement sector fell 0.6 percent and the plastics and chemical sector lost 0.1
percent, while the paper and pulp sector closed unchanged.</P>
      <P>"With market sentiment cautious about the economic fundamentals, it is not easy
for the index to remain above 8,000 points, " Concord Securities analyst Allen
Lin said. "It had been widely expected that yesterday's gains would prompt
investors to take profit today."</P>
      <P>Lin said investors rushed to dump non-high tech stocks to lock in recent
profits.</P>
      <P>"Strong buying in traditional industrial shares recently has highly boosted
margin trading, which may further destabilize the broader market," Lin said,
adding that margin trading exceeded NT$260 billion.</P>
      <P>"I expect more selling to emerge, pushing the market into a consolidation mode,"
Lin said, " When the index rebounds, it will be a good time to cut holdings."</P>
      <P>Lin said the electronics sector is expected to remain weak amid increasing
concerns over its earnings outlook as investors turned gloomy about global
demand.</P>
      <P>Flat panel maker AU Optronics fell 1.78 percent to NT$30.35 after it reported a
10.9 percent decline in July sales on a month-on-month basis, while rival Chimei
Innolux dropped 3.52 percent to NT$38.40.</P>
      <P>Among notebook computer producers, Quanta fell 2.05 percent to NT$52.50 and
Wistron dropped 2.43 percent to NT$52.20 as they saw double digit falls in July
sales.</P>
      <P>Textile firm Far Eastern New Century dropped 2.18 percent to NT$38.20 and Wei-

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC), the world's largest contract
chipmaker, said Tuesday that its sales in July continued to hit a record high on
the back of strong global demand.</P>
      <P>TSMC posted NT$37.22 billion (US$1.18 billion) in sales for the month, up 2.4
percent from a month earlier and also up 19.4 percent from a year earlier.</P>
      <P>In the first seven months of this year, TSMC's sales totaled NT$234.37 billion,
up 61.8 percent year-on-year.</P>
      <P>Henry Miao, an analyst with Hua Nan Securities, said demand for consumer
electronics remained robust, which boosted the global chip foundry business.</P>
      <P>"A global financial meltdown last year forced many microchip makers in Europe to
close their plants or cut their production scales, " Miao said. "Orders have
been flowing into TSMC and rival United Microelectronics Corp. (UMC)," he added.</P>
      <P>UMC is the second-largest contract chipmaker in the world.</P>
      <P>"Now, a recovery in demand for consumer electronics continues to increase sales
for TSMC and UMC. They are the beneficiaries of the latest business closures and
downsizing," Miao went on.</P>
      <P>UMC reported Monday that its sales in July rose 4.7 percent from June, hitting a
record high in almost 6 years.</P>
      <P>In an investor conference held in late July, TSMC said its production capacity
was fully utilized in the second quarter of this year and that it expected full
utilization to continue into the third quarter.</P>
      <P>The company also announced that it will raise its 2010 capacity expenditure to
US$5.9 billion from the previously planned US$4.8 billion to further boost
capacity.</P>
      <P>"Judging from the tight supply in the global foundry business, I have no doubt
that TSMC will be able to maintain full utilization and post a new high in
monthly sales in the current quarter," Miao said.</P>
      <P>"However, as the global economy has shown signs of slowing, there are some
concerns over the outlook in the fourth quarter, " Miao continued, adding that
the market is afraid that the upcoming Christmas season will not deliver
satisfactory sales.</P>
      <P>Like UMC shares, Miao said, TSMC shares failed to follow recent strong gains on
the broader market on economic fundamental worries.</P>
      <P>TSMC closed up 0.49 percent at NT$61.00 on the Taiwan Stock Exchange Tuesday.</P>

      <P>Taiwan-born fashion designer Mei Hui Liu showcased designs featuring Union Jack
flags and vintage lace in an east London exhibition on Monday, attracting many
long-term fans.</P>
      <P>Liu, who left Taiwan in 1995 and has stayed mostly in Europe since then, opened
a shop called Victim Fashion Street in East London in 2001 and has been invited
to several major international fashion events.</P>
      <P>In her exhibition "Union Jack Fairy Tale," Liu used British flags from 1910-1920
and antique lace to create her latest fashion series.</P>
      <P>"I love to collect antique flags and lace, " Liu told the Central News Agency at
the exhibition. "I usually start to design after finding those materials."</P>
      <P>She also insists on creating all of her designs by herself, and her uniqueness
is making her collections increasingly popular in the U.K.</P>
      <P>"Because my designs are unique and non-seasonal, many clients have stayed with
me for more than 10 years," Liu said.</P>
      <P>Award-winning Taiwanese fashion designer Johan Ku also endorsed Liu's
consistency in style, saying she gave new life to the Victorian fabrics.</P>
      <P>"Liu is very firm about her style, and those who love it have been following
her, " Ku said. "That's why she was able to gain a foothold in the competitive
London fashion industry."</P>
      <P>Katharine S.Y. Chang, Taiwan's top representative stationed in London, praised
Liu's design for its unique style and elegance.</P>
      <P>Chang said that after learning ballet when she was younger, she was impressed by
the pettiskirt designs in Liu's collection.</P>
      <P>"I hope I can have one skirt like that...they are truly exceptional," she said.</P>
      <P>Hattie Morahan, an award-winning English actress, said she has been Liu's loyal
customer since they met seven years ago.</P>
      <P>"Sometimes I feel like I'm dressing myself with history (when I wear Liu's
designs) "said Morahan, whose performance in a TV adaptation of Jane Austen's
novel "Sense and Sensibility" won her Best Actress at the Shanghai Television
Festival in 2008.</P>
      <P>Morahan also said that every time when she wears Liu's designs, people ask her
about the designer and where they can buy the clothes.</P>
      <P>London-based band Maleficent's singer Maleficent Martini attended the exhibition
wearing one of Liu's Union Jack skirts that she said she wore in her first music
video.</P>
      <P>Martini said she had recommended Liu's collection -- via social websites
Facebook and Twitter -- to many of her friends and fans since she bought Liu's
collection four years ago.</P>

      <P>A Taiwanese medical team said Tuesday it had developed a new way to fight brain
cancer that combines ultrasound techniques and the use of magnetic particles to
deliver more drugs to the brain than previously possible with non-invasive
techniques.</P>
      <P>Wei Kuo-chen of Chang Hung Memorial Hospital, Linkou Branch said that the blood-
brain barrier makes it difficult for drugs to enter the brain.  The special
barrier separates the brain from the circulatory system, protecting it from
infection but also limiting the entry of most medication, said Wei, the chair of
the Department of Neurosurgery.</P>
      <P>Led by Wei, the medical team has been testing the proposed non-invasive
technique on mice with brain tumors.  They focus ultrasonic waves to disrupt the
blood-brain barrier before inserting drug-laced magnetic nanoparticles into the
brain, where they are led to tumor regions using powerful magnets.</P>
      <P>Results show that the amount of drug concentration in the tumor area has
increased 20 percent, with mice undergoing the experiment living 1.66 times
longer than untreated mice.</P>
      <P>Though malignant brain tumors occur in only 2-3 per 100,000 people, it is often
not detected until an advanced stage, when the patient is often left with about
a year to live.</P>
      <P>Malignant tumor cells can be surgically removed, but usually chemotherapy is
required to kill cancer cells left behind.</P>
      <P>The team said that it will continue research on the technique, with the goal of
eventually using it on humans.</P>

      <P>A local research team has recently discovered a new method to detect possible
neutrino electromagnetic interaction, a discovery that will increase
experimental sensitivity by more than 100 times, a researcher with Taiwan's top
research institute Academia Sinica said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>"The new method has raised the sensitivity of the study of neutrino magnetic
moments, which can promote future research in particle physics and cosmology, "
said team leader Henry Tsz-king Wong, a research fellow for the Institute of
Physics at Academia Sinica. He described neutrino magnetic moments as a
scientific term used to indicate possible neutrino electromagnetic interaction.</P>
      <P>"The feature of the new method is that we unveiled a mechanism of atomic

    <HEADLINE>Taiwanese pianist expresses deep affinity with two 'river' concertos</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>08/10/10  19:31:15</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The music inspired by two rivers on either side of the Taiwan Strait should be
performed back to back at one concert to highlight the similarities and unique
differences in sentiment and influences, according to a renowned Taiwanese
musician.</P>
      <P>Concert pianist Rueibin Chen, who has played both the Yellow River and Love
River concertos for international audiences, said the two pieces resonate deeply
with him.</P>
      <P>The Yellow River Piano Concerto is always a big challenge because of the
emotional associations it elicits, he said in a recent interview with the
Central News Agency.</P>
      <P>"I must control the overwhelming emotions evoked by the epic music, which, in my
mind, becomes scenes that reflect the legacies of contemporary Chinese history,"
he said.</P>
      <P>Three of Chen's most recent concerts featured the Yellow River Concerto, which
is the best-known Chinese composition in the world. He performed as the piano
soloist in a 200-member orchestra of mostly Chinese instruments in Hong Kong
early this year, and later was accompanied by a symphony orchestra at a concert
in the northern Chinese city of Tientsin. His most recent performance was in
Shanghai in May.</P>
      <P>"I first learned about the Yellow River concerto when I was a music student in
Vienna in the early 1980s," he said.</P>
      <P>A Chinese musician told Chen the story of the concerto, which is based on the
Yellow River Cantata that was composed by Xian Xinghai of China during World War
II (1937-1945) when Sino-Japanese conflict was at a peak.</P>
      <P>"I was deeply moved by the story of the struggle of the nation and the people,
and have since tried to comprehend the nuances which reflect a very Chinese
sentiment."</P>
      <P>Although he moved from Taiwan to Vienna at the age of 12, Chen said, he is still
very Chinese.</P>
      <P>"Also, probably because I have traveled to China many times since the 1980s on
concert tours, I feel very connected to the music, " he said.</P>
      <P>Chen's first visit to China was more than 10 years ago, long after the Cultural
Revolution that inspired some of the music that was later added to the concerto.</P>
      <P>"Over the past years, I've seen changes in the land and among the people, and
the music of Yellow River always conjures up many images of the past, " he said.
"Like a river of history, it reveals so much about the misery, frustration and
perseverance of the people and the land."</P>
      <P>The fourth movement of the concerto, which has been described by critics as too
politically loaded and militaristic, has been edited many times and the various
editions have been given different interpretations by pianists and orchestras.</P>
      <P>But Chen said that for him the most moving version of the piece is the original
Yellow River Cantata composed by Xian Xinghai.</P>
      <P>However, at his recent concerts in Hong Kong, Tientsin and Shanghai, Chen
performed a version that was edited in the 1960s and in which the melody of The
East Is Red -- the de facto anthem of the People's Republic of China during the
Cultural Revolution -- recurs consistently.</P>
      <P>"The Yellow River Piano Concerto arranged by Yin Chengxong and Chu Wanghua in
1969 has become popular again in China after being banned on concert stages when
the Cultural Revolution ended, " he said.</P>
      <P>The East Is Red music in the fourth movement is no longer considered taboo
because it is now associated more with China's rising power in the 21st century
than with the haunting memories of the Cultural Revolution, Chen said.</P>
      <P>"Some renowned Chinese and Western pianists have picked up the piece and made it
the best known Chinese piano concerto in the world," he said.</P>
      <P>Not that there are many piano concertos by ethnic Chinese composers, he noted.
One of the few is the Love River Piano Concerto, composed by Taiwanese Lu Liang-
hui in 2006.</P>
      <P>"The mood of the Love River Piano Concerto is comparable to the Yellow River
Piano Concerto because they both combine Western music methodology with elements
of Chinese music," he said.</P>
      <P>The Love River Piano Concerto uses piano and Chinese musical instruments to
portray the seasonal scenery along the Love River in southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen and the Kaohsiung City Chinese Orchestra have given a series of highly
acclaimed performances of the piece in Taiwan, the United States, Australia and
New Zealand.</P>
      <P>"I can detect the influence of Russian Romanticism in both concertos --
Tchaikovsky and Rachmaninov in particular, " Chen said. "Actually, I was amazed
when a music critic in Tientsin told me that he was sure my interpretation of
the Yellow River music was inspired by Russian Romanticism."</P>
      <P>He admitted that despite his training in Austria and Germany and his admiration
for Beethoven, he always falls for the passion of Chopin, Tchaikovsky, Liszt and
Rachmaninov.</P>
      <P>The pianist said that he would like to perform the two "river" concertos, which
are each approximately 20 minutes long, at one concert.</P>
      <P>The Yellow River Piano Concerto has never been performed in Taiwan, and people
on mainland China probably do not know about the Love River composition, he
said. "I always believe that music is the best medium through which to forge
affinity," Chen said. "In the Yellow River and Love River pieces, you can find
similarities, and at the same time, appreciate the uniqueness of each."

    <HEADLINE>Pro-independence groups urge solidarity against maverick magistrate</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Several groups that support Taiwan's independence  called for solidarity
Tuesday  against Kaohsiung Magistrate Yang Chiu-hsing in the year-end Kaohsiung
mayoral election after Yang announced his election bid a day earlier in defiance
of his opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Society and the Taiwan South Society urged DPP supporters to rally
behind Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu, who is the DPP's candidate, in the election
scheduled to take place Nov. 27.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Society Deputy President  Tseng Kui-hai said Yang's betrayal of the DPP
is the equivalent of "a powerful explosive thrown by the ruling Kuomintang deep
inside the DPP" that will severely damage the party and the pro-independence
camp.</P>
      <P>"Yang's action serves as a tool of the rival camp and will eventually be
renounced and recorded in history," Tseng said.</P>
      <P>Writer Wu Chin-fa, who has long been a firm supporter of Yang, said the
magistrate has gone astray as a result of his pursuit of political power, and
added that he is especially disappointed at Yang's support of the cross-Taiwan
Strait economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) to which the DPP is
opposed.</P>
      <P>In an interview with the media, Yang offered "conditional support" for the ECFA,
saying that it will prevent Taiwan from becoming economically isolated.</P>
      <P>However, DPP legislative caucus head Ke Chein-ming said Yang's ECFA support is
purely out of personal political considerations.</P>
      <P>DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen said she is still confident of a DPP win in the
year-end elections in Taiwan's to-be-formed five special municipalities --
Taipei City, Xinbei City (an upgrade of Taipei County), Taichung City (a merger
of the city and county of Taichung), Tainan City (a merger of the city and
county of Tainan) , and Kaohsiung City (a merger of the city and county of
Kaohsiung.)</P>
      <P>"I don't think Yang's running will change the result of the Kaohsiung mayoral
election, " Tsai said. The DPP regards a party victory in the southern Taiwan
municipality as a virtual certainty.</P>
      <P>"After the setback in the 2008 presidential election, DPP supporters have
demonstrated strong solidarity and that is why I have confidence in the election
prospects," Tsai said in a radio interview earlier in the day.</P>
      <P>Tsai was responding to press queries about the possible negative impact on the
DPP's election prospects as a result of Yang's move, which might be followed by
incumbent Tainan Mayor Hsu Tian-tsair. Both Yang and Hsu lost in the DPP
primaries.</P>
      <P>Tsai said her party will use "every possible means" to dissuade Hsu from
running.</P>
      <P>"The DPP has enjoyed its strongest support in Tainan in all past elections, "
Tsai said, adding that the party will win whether Hsu runs or not.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, KMT Secretary- General King Pu-tsung dismissed rumors that the ruling
party might adopt an election strategy of giving up party candidate Huang Chao-
shun and shifting its support to Yang in the Kaohsiung election.</P>
      <P>"They (the rumors) underestimate not only the KMT's determination and
perseverance in winning the Kaohsiung election but also Huang's
competitiveness," King said.</P>
      <P>"I certainly will not resort to that kind of strategy, " King said, while
calling on KMT supporters to have confidence in the party.</P>
      <P>He also said the KMT has not played any role in urging Yang to run in Kaohsiung
in an attempt to gain from the split of the DPP vote that Yang is expected to
cause.</P>

      <P>Taiwan and China should integrate their textile sectors' value chains and
strengthen cooperation on material applications  to meet the challenge  of
mounting international competition, a local economist said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Bringing  together  Taiwan's  experience  in marketing  and distribution and
China's manufacturing prowess would form a potent combination, argued Bai Chi-
chung, president of the Taiwan Textile Research Institute, in a speech at a
conference on cross-strait textile cooperation.</P>
      <P>Bai said the economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) signed by Taiwan
and China in late June provided a good catalyst to strengthen integration
because it will reduce the cost of shipping textile products to China.</P>
      <P>The trade pact is expected to cut Chinese import duties on Taiwanese textile
exports to US$95.62 million in 2011, from US$174.68 million in 2009.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's ambition to become a global production center of functional and
industrial-use textiles also could play a role in cross-strait textile
cooperation.</P>
      <P>By 2015, Bai said, materials for garments, household textiles and industrial
textiles will be produced in Taiwan in a 48-12-40 ratio, with total output value
reaching NT$600 billion (US$18.9 billion).</P>
      <P>Taiwan has also been promoting the formation of industrial strategic alliances
and industrial clusters and the creation of new brands, Bai added, and he
contended that closer integration of the two sides' value chains would lead to
even more value-added products and open new markets around the world.</P>
      <P>Cooperation could start with efforts to establish communication channels to
discuss specialized fabrics,  innovative production processes, innovative
product design and applications, and new textile product standards, Bai
suggested.</P>
      <P>He also said Taiwan and China should remove barriers to the development of the
cross-strait textile industry and cater to global calls for environmental
protection, energy conservation, carbon emission reductions, and intellectual
property rights protection.</P>

      <P>Chinese college students who are studying in Taiwan on exchange programs praised
Taiwan's higher education Tuesday,  saying  they have benefited  from its
openness  and liberalization.</P>
      <P>Yuan Tao, who is one of the exchange program students, said she has been
impressed by the openness and liberalization of Taiwan's education environment,
adding that she also likes the democratic atmosphere on campus.</P>
      <P>A chemistry major from Nanjing University currently studying in Yuan Ze
University in northern Taiwan's Chungli City, Yuan said Taiwan's education
promotes self-thinking and provides an advanced way of learning.</P>
      <P>She was speaking at a news conference held by the ruling Kuomintang, which has
pushed hard for the passage of law amendments allowing Chinese students to
enroll in local schools.</P>
      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party has voiced strong opposition to the
amendments out of concern that the presence of Chinese students will hurt the
job prospects of Taiwanese students.</P>
      <P>Yuan said Taiwan's schools also place heavy emphasis on how to boost students'
work experience by offering a wide variety of part-time jobs, adding that this
helps reduce the financial burden on students.</P>
      <P>She said she feels safe in Taiwan with the support of her teachers and

      <P>Taipei County officials said Tuesday that the county government will attend a
briefing in late August for an open tender for the right to take possession of
the 2010 Shanghai World Expo's Taiwan Pavilion once it is dismantled and shipped
back to Taiwan after the show.</P>
      <P>Li Tsung-kuei, director of the Taipei County Tourism and Travel Bureau, said
that as the pavilion is in the shape of a lamp, it would be very suitable for it
to be rebuilt in the county's Pingxi, a township known for its annual sky
lantern festival.</P>
      <P>"We will send our staff to attend the Aug. 26 briefing held by the Taiwan
External Trade Development Council (TAITRA) and try our best to secure the right
to host the pavilion," he said.</P>
      <P>In addition to the Taipei county government, the Taichung city government and
the Miaoli county government, as well as the E-Da Theme Park in Kaohsiung also
have expressed interest in rebuilding the Taiwan Pavilion after it is dismantled
at the conclusion of the World Expo Oct. 31.</P>
      <P>According to TAITRA Chairman Wang Chih-kang, the pavilion, which greeted its
400,000th visitor Tuesday, will be brought back to Taiwan and the trade body
will not let public or private Chinese investors take part in the bidding.</P>
      <P>Wang told CNA that the open tender is expected to be held in late September or
early October, and the lowest tender will be decided by professional appraisal
firms, he said.</P>
      <P>Wang has previously said that a giant LED ball located at the center of the
pavilion is worth over NT$200 million (US$6.3 million).</P>
      <P>With Chinese visitors accounting for about 90 percent of the total visitors to
the Taiwan Pavilion at the expo, it is expected to attract a lot of Chinese
tourists after it is moved back to Taiwan, the Tourism Bureau said, estimating
that the number of Chinese tourists visiting Taiwan will reach 1.2 million this
year.</P>
      <P>Eric Liluan Chu, the ruling Kuomintang's candidate in the year-end election for
mayor of Xinbei City, the name of the upgraded Taipei County, said earlier that
he will throw his full support behind Taipei Magistrate Chou Hsi-wei's bid for
the pavilion.</P>
      <P>Chu said that Pingxi Township will be even more distinguished by the Taiwan
Pavilion and that it will be less meaningful if it is rebuilt somewhere else.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Consumers' Foundation said Tuesday that its campaign for a referendum on the
government's decision to import bone-in beef from the U.S. had failed.</P>
      <P>Hsieh Tien-jen, chairman of the foundation, said that his foundation could not
collect the 866,090 signatures needed to complete the second stage of a
referendum proposal by the Aug. 10 deadline.</P>
      <P>He warned, however, that the risk of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease from U.S. beef
had grown as the U.S. was increasing its exploration of the local market.</P>
      <P>The foundation began to push for a plebiscite on Nov. 1 last year after Taipei
signed a protocol with Washingtonon Oct. 22 agreeing to lift bans on imports of
U.S. bone-in beef, internal organs and ground beef.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said his foundation, which was trying to reverse the policy by forcing the
government to reopen negotiations with Washington, had collected 130,259
signatures within 18 days to meet the requirements to initiate a referendum
proposal.</P>
      <P>The signatures were presented to the Central Election Commission for review on
Dec. 8, Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>After verifying  the signatures,  the commission  gave the foundation a green
light on Feb. 10 to seek 866,090 sponsors for the proposal -- or 5 percent of
the eligible voters in the last presidential elections -- within six months.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said the foundation managed to collect only 80,000 sponsors by the Tuesday
deadline.</P>
      <P>He attributed the failure to waning public interest because of the three-month
legislative debate over the policy, adding that some of the public believed the
referendum had already passed.</P>
      <P>Another reason for the failure, he said, is that the public wrongly thinks
health risks were diffused after the Legislative Yuan revised the law to
prohibit imports of offal and ground beef.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said people are reluctant to endorse the referendum proposal because they
fear that a failed referendum, which is quite possible as no previous referendum
has succeeded, might encourage local and U.S. authorities to sell U.S. beef here
more aggressively.</P>
      <P>He also blamed the authorities for what he called harassment of workers who
helped the foundation solicit signatures, and told the public that just because
beef is legal doesn't mean it is safe.</P>
      <P>Hsieh cited Chen Shun-sheng, deputy superintendent of Kaohsiung Chang Gung
Memorial Hospital, as saying that prions -- rogue proteins that can cause
variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease -- were found in skeletal muscle, diaphragm,
blood vessels, lymph nodes, tonsils and internal organs of a U.S. cow diagnosed
with mad cow disease.</P>
      <P>"Beef other than internal  organs and ground meat is not necessarily safe, " he
warned. "Don't take chances just for tasty food."</P>
      <P>The government's decision to import U.S. bone-in beef caused a public outcry
that died down only after legislators across party lines scrambled to revise the
law.</P>
      <P>The Department of Health, which negotiated the protocol on behalf of Taiwan, was
reprimanded by the Control Yuan for failing to inform the legislature of its
decision in advance.</P>
      <P>The executive branch, which was forced to renege on the bone-in beef part of the
agreement with Washington, was reportedly displeased with the result but
refrained from vetoing it to prevent a political crisis.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ECFA to create over 10,000 jobs in Taichung: vice president</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taichung,  Aug. 10 (CNA)
08/10/10  21:00:00
(By Lee Hsi-chang and Jeffrey Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Vincent Siew said Tuesday that the inking of the economic
cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) with China will help create extra 12,700
jobs in Taichung and upgrade industries in the area.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a forum with the local business community, Siew said that the June
29 clinching of the trade deal with China is set to benefit 2,800 local
companies out of a total of roughly 15,000 factories in the central Taiwan area.</P>
      <P>The establishment of the ECFA is also expected to help local enterprises achieve
an additional combined production value of NT$26.1 billion, he added.</P>
      <P>"With the signing of the ECFA, economic interaction between Taiwan and China is
going to be institutionalized and normalized, helping Taiwan avoid
marginalization in the face of increased regional economic integration," he
explained.</P>
      <P>Taichung Mayor Jason Hu, who hosted the forum and also visited Malaysia to
promote the area's agricultural specialties July 20, capitalized on the upside
of the ECFA, pointing out that the president of a southeastern Asian country has
approved visits by his ministers to Taiwan in the wake of the ECFA signing.</P>
      <P>Based on the groundwork laid by the ECFA, Singapore also announced a plan last
week to initiate two-way talks about a free trade-like economic cooperation
agreement with Taiwan.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Representatives of the residents of Mailiao Township  in  Yunlin  County,
location  of  an accident-prone petrochemical complex, cut off talks Tuesday
with the Formosa Plastics Group (FPG) that runs the complex after rejecting a
compensation proposal.</P>
      <P>The representatives, including Yunlin County Councilor Lin Shen, warned FPG that
protests over pollution caused by a July 25 fire at the plant will continue.</P>
      <P>It was the second round of talks between Mailiao residents and the giant
enterprise since the fire, the second in a month, broke out. The locals
complained that particulate matter produced during the blaze have caused acid
rain and pollution that have killed fish and clams raised by aquaculturists in
the area.</P>
      <P>A research report also shows that the cancer death rate among people living
around the FPG petrochemical complex is higher than the Taiwanese average.</P>
      <P>The victims of the pollution refused to accept the company's promise to cover
all damages with a total payment of NT$450 million (US$14.16 million).</P>
      <P>The protesters demanded that the amount should only be used to compensate for
damage to farmlands and acquaculture ponds.</P>
      <P>FPG should also pay for health checks for the residents, as well as health
compensation, they contended.</P>
      <P>The requests,  however,  drew an immediate  complaint from representatives of
the biggest diversified industrial company in Taiwan, who argued that should the
company yield, the protesters will simply demand even more.</P>
      <P>This further incensed the representatives of the residents, who walked out of
the negotiations and said the protests will continue.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Businesses to continue in science park despite injunction</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug 10 (CNA)
08/10/10  22:59:23
(By Jenny W. Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Companies in the Houli branch of the Central Taiwan Science Park will continue
operation despite a court order to halt all development until an environmental
assessment dispute has been resolved, the park's administration said at a press
conference Monday evening.</P>
      <P>The administration contended that the injunction by the Taipei High
Administrative Court on July 30 does not pertain to companies that have already
started work in the park.</P>
      <P>Park Director-General Yang Wen-ke said the parties named in the case were the
park administration, the Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) and the
National Science Council -- not the companies operating in the park.</P>
      <P>"We will stop all public construction projects and work. On the issue of whether
the businesses should suspend operation, however, we feel the verdict does not
cover a third party and therefore the issue is moot," Yang said.</P>
      <P>The announcement came more than one week after the court placed an injunction on
the third and fourth phase of the Central Taiwan Science Park development
project, saying a mandatory suspension of all development work in the Houli and
Erlin branches must be imposed until further environmental impact assessment has
been made and approved.</P>
      <P>The EPA and the council filed a joint appeal on Monday to fight the injunction,
saying that the panel of judges made the decision without taking expert opinions
into consideration.</P>
      <P>EPA Minister Stephen Shen lambasted the court, saying it would sabotage the
credibility of the agency's Environmental  Impact Assessment Committee and
jeopardize investor confidence in the government's ability to honor its pledges.</P>
      <P>While the EPA and the council panned the court's ruling, environmental groups
and their lawyers saw it as a victory and said that if businesses in the park
suffer, it would be the EPA's fault for giving them the go-ahead before rulings
on the impact reports were finalized.</P>
      <P>In a forum on Monday at National Taiwan University's (NTU) Policy and Law Center
for Environmental Sustainability, opponents of the development lauded the
court's "courageous" decision but said the current assessment process is in dire
need of a major overhaul.</P>
      <P>Lin San-chia, a staff attorney at the Legal Aid Foundation, said the root of the
problem is not the assessment system itself, but the handling of conclusions the
committee reaches.</P>
      <P>Lin accused the EPA of pandering to the corporate circle while overlooking the
rights of local residents and not considering the sustainability of Taiwan's
ecosystem.</P>
      <P>Yeh Jiunn-rong, an NTU law professor and former executive director of the
Cabinet-level National Council for Sustainable Development, suggested the EPA
give up its power to veto development projects and leave the burden of
environmental impact assessments on the individual agency responsible for the
project.</P>
      <P>In this case, the National Science Council would be responsible.</P>
      <P>Doing so, he argued, would improve the efficiency of the assessments because the
committee would not be encumbered by them or face the pressure of vouching for
the government.</P>
      <P>He cited the U.S. Navy as an example, saying the military branch conducts its
own impact reports prior to setting up a simulation at a beach, making sure its
activity will not hurt the local marine ecology.</P>
      <P>Local activists such as Robin Winkler, however, rejected Yeh's idea, calling it
impractical because it would strip away an important line of defense aimed at
keeping politicians from being in cahoots with the corporate world.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Chief of Taiwan trade-promotion body outlines work in China</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Shanghai,  Aug. 10 (CNA)
08/10/10  23:12:10
(By Charles Kang and Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's recently signed trade pact with China highlights the importance of the
country's trade promotion body, the Taiwan External Trade Development Council
(TAITRA) , in helping Taiwan businessmen explore the Chinese market,  TAITRA
Chairman Wang Chih-kang, said here Tuesday.</P>
      <P>During a visit to the Taiwan Pavilion at the 2010 Shanghai World Expo, Wang said
that although the economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) provides
Taiwanese businessmen with easier access to the Chinese market, they still need
help to break into the market.</P>
      <P>This is especially true for Taiwan's small- and medium-sized businesses, which
have difficulty finding outlets in China for their products and introducing
Chinese customers to their lesser-known brands, Wang said.</P>
      <P>"Our council can give them a helping hand in this regard, " Wang said.</P>
      <P>Noting  that many Taiwanese  industries  will face intense competition from
their Chinese counterparts as more than 200 items of Chinese goods will be
allowed into Taiwan under the ECFA, Wang said his council can help them to cope
with the pressure by improving the quality of their products and sharpening
their competitiveness.</P>
      <P>"A major part of TAITRA's strategy is to stage an international design contest
in Taipei next year," Wang said.</P>
      <P>"The contest, which will invite more than 3,000 well-known designers to showcase
their works, is expected to attract 4 million visitors," he said.</P>
      <P>"This event, just like the 2010 International Flora Expo to be held in Taipei
City Nov. 6, 2010-April 25, 2011, will greatly enhance Taiwan's image," Wang
went on.</P>
      <P>Turning to the branding image of "Made in Taiwan" currently being touted, Wang
noted that the council organizes trade fairs for good Taiwan products in five
Chinese cities every year to expose Chinese consumers  to quality  Taiwanese
products  and help Taiwanese businessmen to sell their goods.</P>
      <P>Citing this year as an example, Wang said TAITRA has already staged fairs in
Dongguan in Guangdong Province and Tianjin City, and will go on to stage fairs
in Nanjing in Jiangsu Province, Jinan in Shangdong Province and Chongqing City.</P>
      <P>"Companies that display their products at these fairs report seeing their sales
growing by three times to 10 times," Wang said.</P>
      <P>The Nanjing trade fair is timed to coincide with the opening of a shopping mall
there exclusively for Taiwanese products. It will be the second fair in Nanjing
in as many years, Wang noted.</P>
      <P>The just-concluded fair in Tianjin, which attracted 1.5 million visitors and
resulted in a combined NT$800 million (US$25.16 million) in revenue for
participating Taiwanese companies, was so successful that the local government
is planning to follow Nanjing's lead by building a shopping mall for Taiwanese
products, Wang said.</P>
      <P>TAITRA will also lead a group of Taiwanese companies to take part in a Northeast
Asia trade show in Changchun, Jilin Province in September, to solicit business
from Russia, Japan, and both South and North Korea.</P>
      <P>It will also organize a Taiwanese delegation to a trade fair in Nannin, Guangxi
Province next year, which will be aimed at exploring the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations market.</P>
      <P>In addition to promoting sales of Taiwanese goods in China, TAITRA is inviting
Chinese procurement groups to visit Taiwan this year, including 11 delegations
organized by provincial governments. They are expected to buy US$20 billion-
worth of goods.</P>
      <P>Wang also said the Taiwan Pavilion at the Shanghai Expo, which was built by
TAITRA at a cost of NT$1.1 billion, will be dismantled and shipped back to
Taiwan after the expo ends Oct. 31.</P>
      <P>"Several counties in Taiwan have expressed interest in buying it via public
bidding," he noted.</P>
      <P>He said the pavilion which recorded its 400,000th visitor Tuesday, is a magnet
for tourists at the expo and is sure to boost tourism for the local government
that wins the bid to buy it.</P>
      <P>Although Wang said the lowest tender for the pavilion will need to be assessed
by experts, news reports said TAITRA hopes the bidding can go as high as NT$400
million.</P>

      <P>There have been several recent cases of capital increase or reduction plans by
listed companies being rejected by the Financial Supervisory Commission. The
latest one is a plan by Tatung Co. to reduce its capital by NT$32.13 billion.</P>
      <P>On the surface, reducing capital to write off losses does not affect the
interests of shareholders. However, there are some underlying factors that must
be considered, such as the reasons for the losses, whether the companies have
taken actions that are unfavorable to their shareholders, and whether there are
other alternatives to reducing capital.</P>
      <P>What requires tight observation is capital increase following capital reduction.
If capital increase is to be achieved through private placement or the issue of
global depository receipts (GDRs) or euro-convertible bonds (ECBs) , we should
pay attention to their pricing, discount rate and the identities of subscribers.</P>
      <P>If the subscribers of shares issued in private placement at a discount are
company board directors, supervisors, managers, major shareholders or related
parties, then the interests of external shareholders will be undermined. As to
the issuance of GDRs and ECBs, there have been cases in which insiders or
related parties have set up paper companies overseas to offer the securities at
a discount.</P>
      <P>Therefore, revising the existing rules to plug the loopholes in the private
placement system is essential to building a healthy capital market. (Editorial

    <TEXT>
      <P>The share prices of personal computer maker Acer Inc. plunged in Wednesday
morning trade after it reported a 40 percent fall in July sales from the
previous month, dealers said.</P>
      <P>In mid-morning trade,  Acer fell 4.02 percent to NT$83.50 (US$2.63) , with 10.81
million shares changing hands, while the weighted index was down 0.69 percent at
7,921.98.</P>
      <P>Acer posted NT$26.26 billion in July sales, down 40.87 percent from June and
also down 37.67 percent from a year earlier.</P>
      <P>"The decline in sales surprised the market, so investors rushed to dump their
holdings at the opening, " Taiwan International Securities analyst Michael
Chiang said.</P>
      <P>Chiang said the current  selling likely came largely from institutional
investors.</P>
      <P>The fall in revenue reflected the lingering effect of the debt problems in the
eurozone which is one of Acer's main revenue sources.</P>
      <P>"Even worse, Acer's disappointing sales data has added fears that a slower pace
of the world economy recovery will affect global demand for high tech products,"
Chiang said.</P>
      <P>Apart from Acer, other Taiwanese notebook computer firms, such as Quanta
Computer Inc. and Wistron Corp. also reported double digit declines in July
sales, although their drops were not as steep as Acer's.</P>
      <P>Chiang said the silver lining at the moment is that the euro is gaining momentum
and the impact of the eurozone financial problems is likely to decrease.</P>
      <P>In a statement, Acer said its July sales were affected by its introduction of
more competitive products that use Intel's new CPU and chipset design and which
will be rolled out in August in and September.</P>
      <P>Its "key channel partners and distributors were well-informed in advance of the
product rollout, enabling them to adjust their inventory and new orders
accordingly," the company said.</P>
      <P>Acer said it is maintaining its forecast that its that its sales in the third
quarter of this year will rise 10-15 percent from the second quarter.</P>
      <P>"But, as concerns over global demand remain, it needs more time for the pressure
on Acer shares to ease," Chiang said.</P>
      <P>He said the stock may not see strong support until it falls to NT$80.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>With the economy regaining momentum, all of Taiwan's 14 financial holding
conglomerates posted profits in July. Their combined earning of around NT$16.4
billion (US$512.5 million) was a 56 percent increase year-on-year, according to
statistics released by the Taiwan Stock Exchange (TWSE).</P>
      <P>In contrast, notebook vendor Acer saw its unconsolidated business revenues
plunge nearly 40 percent in July as compared to the year earlier level,  and
four major notebook contract  makers also registered negative turnover growth
during that month.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the board of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) , the
world's largest contract chipmaker, passed a US$3.82 billion capital investment
budget Tuesday. Most of the money will be used to fund R&amp;D and factory
construction or expansion projects.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from the local media coverage of relevant topics:</P>
      <P>Commercial Times:</P>
      <P>Fubon Financial Holding Co. outshone its competitors by grossing NT$4.52 billion
in after-tax profit in July, and its accumulated net earnings for the first
seven months amounted to NT$15.21 billion, while its EPS (earnings per share)
reached NT$1.87, which was also the highest among its competitors.</P>
      <P>Financial holding groups not only made huge profits in July but also saw huge
spikes in their share prices and trading volumes in recent weeks, TWSE
statistics showed.</P>
      <P>On Tuesday, the financial sector alone accounted for 10 percent of the TWSE's
daily trading, up from 7 percent at the end of July.</P>
      <P>Since the beginning of August, the 14 financial holding groups have posted an
average 5.25 percent growth in share prices. Among them,  SinoPac Holdings,
TaiShin Holdings and Yuanta Holdings registered biggest gains of 11.16 percent,
8.74 percent and 8.65 percent, respectively.</P>
      <P>Cathay Financial Holdings managed to turn around its business in the first seven
months of this year, netting NT$1.44 billion in after-tax profits in July and
NT$460 million in total earnings for the January-July period.</P>
      <P>By the end of July, TaiShin was the only financial holding company that was
still in the red, recording a combined loss of NT$1.134 billion for the seven-
month period. (Aug. 11, 2010).</P>
      <P>Economic Daily News:</P>
      <P>The notebook computer market saw a sudden drop in July, with both major brand-
name laptop vendors and contract makers experiencing sales declines.</P>
      <P>Acer, Taiwan's most famous brand-name laptop vendor, saw its unconsolidated
sales drop 37.67 percent to NT$26.26 billion in July year-on-year. This was an
even steeper decrease than the 40.87 percent drop in its June sales. The July
sales were the company's lowest monthly record in nearly one and a half years.</P>
      <P>Financial institutional investors said Acer may be unable to realize its goal of
achieving a 10 percent to 15 percent growth in business turnover for the third
quarter of this year, but Acer issued a press statement Tuesday stressing that
it is confident it can reach the quarterly target.</P>
      <P>In July, major laptops contract makers Quanta, Compal, Wistron and Inventec saw
their business revenues drop by 14 percent, 19 percent, 12.8 percent and 5.4
percent, respectively, from their June records.</P>
      <P>ASUSTek was the only exception,  posting an 11.82 percent month-on-month
increase in business turnover in July.(Aug. 11, 2010).</P>
      <P>Commercial Times:</P>
      <P>TSMC's consolidated business turnover hit yet another new record of NT$37.22
billion in July, up 2.4 percent from June.</P>
      <P>The company's newly passed huge capital investment plan has drawn attention of
the global semiconductor community. Of the US$3.82 budget, US$678.73 million
will mainly be used to finance R&amp;D projects, including research on 28- and
20-nanometer technologies.</P>
      <P>Some US$2 billion will be spent on expanding production capacity of its Fab12 in
Hsinchu Science Park and Fab14 in Southern Taiwan Science Park, and US$369
million will be set aside for a 12" wafer foundry at Central Taiwan Science Park
now under construction.</P>
      <P>The newly approved budget will also be used to upgrade TSMC's Songjiang fab in
China and invest in LED and solar energy industries. (Aug. 11, 2010).</P>

      <P>The Want Want China Times Group will hold a cross-Taiwan Strait wealth creation

brainstorm on ways to promote cross-strait prosperity following the conclusion
of an economic cooperation framework agreement between the two sides in June.</P>
      <P>The forum will discuss how to achieve complementary division of labor between
the industrial sectors of the two sides, how businesses can increase their
footprint in China to seize a share of its rising domestic market, and how to
allow Taiwanese businesses to benefit from China's plan to develop an economic
zone on its west coast opposite Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Other issues to be explored are the potential for cooperation in financial
services, the property sector and brand creation between the two sides.</P>
      <P>The forum will be a very important milestone in cross-strait efforts to enter

wealth creation that has been made possible though cross-strait peace.

      <P>Making expensive promises seems to be a preference of DPP politicians. While the
people have gradually come to recognize that this is merely a vote-buying
tactic, politicians never get tired of doing it.</P>
      <P>In particular, Su Tseng-chang's plan has exposed not only his speculative

fails to see how the fee-per-bag policy has encouraged residents to become
actively involved in trash separation and volume reduction.</P>
      <P>Before the policy was adopted 10 years ago, more than 3,000 tons of garbage were
created in the city every day, but the daily garbage volume has since declined,

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan took two awards in the personal achievement and excellent engineering
project categories Tuesday at an Asian civil engineering conference that is
being held in Sydney.</P>
      <P>Chern Jenn-chuan, vice chairman of the Executive Yuan's Public Construction
Commission, received a personal achievement award for his longtime efforts in
promoting the sustainable development of civil engineering in the Asia-Pacific
region.</P>
      <P>The other award was to Taiwan's high-speed rail system, which was named as the
most "Outstanding Civil Engineering Project, " beating out projects presented by
South Korea, Indonesia and India.</P>
      <P>The participating nations in this year's International Civil Engineering
Conference in the Asian Region include Taiwan, the United States, Australia,
Japan, South Korea, Mongolia, the Philippines, Vietnam, Indonesia, India and
Cambodia.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, before the award ceremony, Chern, who is also deputy
executive  director  of the Executive  Yuan's  Morakot Post-Disaster
Reconstruction Council, gave a speech on Taiwan's reconstruction work in the
wake of Typhoon Morakot.</P>
      <P>Chern said he had maintained frequent contact with international engineering
circles  and  learned  a lot about  post-disaster reconstruction from the
experience of other countries such as Japan and its handling of the 1995 Kobe
earthquake.</P>
      <P>At the awards ceremony, Jeder Hsieh, vice president of Taiwan High Speed Rail
Corp., said the project's award indicates that Taiwan's engineering standards
are gaining international recognition.</P>
      <P>However, there was some controversy over the award, as a representative of
Korea's Samsung Group said that its Incheon Bridge project was an even bigger
project than Taiwan's and should have been given first instead of second prize.</P>
      <P>In response, Hsieh said that the Taiwan project was in no way smaller than
Korea's. Although the Samsung Group was involved in a small part of the high
speed rail construction, the group does not know the full scope of the project,
he said.</P>
      <P>The railway runs through the northern and southern regions of Taiwan, which
means problems of topography and other technical challenges had to be overcome,
Heish said. In addition, it had to be built to strict earthquake resistant
standards, he said.</P>
      <P>The conference, which will run through Aug. 12, is held every three years by the
Asian Civil Engineering Coordinating Council (ACECC).</P>

      <P>Chinese investment in Taiwan currently totals US$122 million and China will take
more measures to encourage Chinese firms to invest in Taiwan, a Chinese official
said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Addressing a seminar in Taipei,  Li Yafei, executive vice president and
secretary-general of the quasi-official Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Straits (ARATS) , said the Chinese government has approved 46 Taiwan
investment projects.</P>
      <P>Li said that although the Chinese investment in Taiwan -- totaling US$122
million -- is not so much, it can still be considered a very good start in
normalizing economic relations across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>"We will take more measures to encourage and push more Chinese companies to
invest or open businesses in Taiwan," Li said.</P>
      <P>With the landmark economic cooperation  framework agreement (ECFA) having
recently been signed, Li noted that the two sides have encountered some new
problems and scenarios.</P>
      <P>"In the progress of implementing the ECFA, we will need to solve and negotiate
new technical issues," Li said.</P>
      <P>Li said that ARATS and its Taiwanese counterpart -- the Straits Exchange
Foundation, will communicate closely on these issues, as well as continue to
improve and expand the effects of the trade pact.</P>
      <P>In the first five months of this year, the number of Taiwanese people visiting

      <P>The Council of Agriculture (COA) said Wednesday that it will step up checks for
salmonella after foreign wire services recently reported that children could be
infected with salmonella by touching pet food.</P>
      <P>The COA's Department of Animal Industry said the department has been conducting
regular inspections of pet food and has issued the results of its checks since
2004, when the Taiwanese distributor of Pedigree dog food was accused of failing
to control the quality of its products made in Thailand, which caused kidney
failure in dogs.</P>
      <P>So far, all the brands checked have passed inspections, according to the
department.</P>
      <P>However, because aflatoxin, melamine and heavy metals pose a more serious health
threat to pets than salmonella, the department has not actually carried out
checks for that type of bacteria, the department admitted.</P>
      <P>Salmonella contamination is usually found in products before they are packaged,
it said, and in many countries, checks for salmonella are conducted by
manufacturers before the delivery of their products, rather than by government
authorities.</P>
      <P>However, to assure pet owners, the department will use some of its aflatoxin-
testing funds for carrying out salmonella testing, the department said.</P>
      <P>The department urged pet owners not to touch pet food with their hands and to
wash their hands immediately after feeding their pets.</P>

      <P>The Taipei High Administrative Court ruled in favor of Taiwan Power Company
(Taipower) Tuesday regarding a fine imposed on the company for not completing a
nuclear waste storage project on time.</P>
      <P>The court ruled that the Taipei County Environmental Protection Bureau did not
have right of jurisdiction to impose a NT$540 million (US$ 16.8 million) fine on
Taipower.</P>
      <P>In the period of 2007 to 2008, the bureau imposed a series of fines on Taipower
for allegedly violating the Environmental Impact Assessment Act and not
submitting a contingency plan regarding the delay of the project, which was
originally scheduled to be completed in 2006.</P>

was ordered to pay separate fines of NT$540 million, NT$210 million and NT$1.2
million.</P>

was dropped in 2008, while the NT$210 million fine was dropped in June this

      <P>Taiwan share prices closed down 1.02 percent Wednesday, led by high-tech and
financial stocks, after Wall Street weakness overnight amid lingering concerns
over the global economic climate, dealers said.</P>
      <P>The weighted index, the market's key barometer, fell 81.71 points to 7,895.03
after moving between 7,869.52 and 7,956.90 on turnover of NT$125.49 billion
(US$3.95 billion).</P>
      <P>The market opened down 0.67 percent and selling accelerated as investors
witnessed other regional markets, such as Japan, Hong Kong and South Korea,
suffering heavy losses, the dealers said.</P>
      <P>A total of 2,677 stocks closed down and 1,003 were up with 223 remaining
unchanged.</P>
      <P>The financial sector posted the largest losses, down 2.5 percent. Foodstuffs
closed down 1.5 percent, construction shares were 1.0 percent lower, machinery
and electronics issues ended the day down 0.9 percent, and the paper and pulp
sector closed 0.7 percent lower.</P>
      <P>Cement shares lost 0.6 percent, textiles fell 0.4 percent and plastics and
chemicals dropped 0.2 percent.</P>
      <P>Mars Hsu, an analyst with Grand Cathay Securities, said a recent downgrade in
the performance of U.S. high-tech stocks by investment banks have dampened
market sentiment here as the electronics sector is the backbone of Taiwan's
exports.</P>
      <P>"The worse-than-expected July sales posted by local computer firms have further
raised concerns over global demand, " Hsu said, referring to Acer's 40 percent
month-on-month fall in July sales, which was the latest unfavorable news in the
local PC sector.</P>
      <P>"Foreign  institutional  investors  continued  dumping local high-tech stocks
today on a gloomy outlook, " Hsu said. "With earnings concerns in place, the
electronics sector might encounter more pressure," he added.</P>
      <P>Hsu said financial stocks were also affected by profit-taking after recent
gains, while many investors still had high hopes that increasing economic
exchanges across the Taiwan Strait will boost the sector's bottom line.</P>
      <P>Hsu said it is worth watching whether the market will hold itself well above the
7,800-point level despite further selling.</P>
      <P>"Once the index falls below 7,800 points, the market will become weak
technically and a major pullback might follow," Hsu said.</P>
      <P>Acer fell 4.14 percent to NT$83.40 on its disappointing July sales data.
However, the company said it has kept unchanged its forecast of 10 percent-15
percent growth in sales for the third quarter, adding that sales will recover in
August and September.</P>
      <P>Smartphone maker HTC lost 2.16 percent to end the day at NT$589.00,  while
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. closed unchanged at NT$61.00.</P>
      <P>In the financial sector, Chang Hwa Bank shed 2.36 percent to finish at NT$18.65
and Taiwan Cooperative Bank fell 1.99 percent to NT$22.20 at the end of trading.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's and China's adherence to an anti-independence stance and the "1992
consensus" has allowed the two sides to build trust over the past two years and
end their confrontation, a visiting Chinese official said in Taipei Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The consensus refers to a mutual understanding reached in 1992 to allow separate
interpretations of "one China, " explained Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Straits Vice Chairman Li Yafei.</P>
      <P>"With political mutual trust, the two sides of the Taiwan Strait have been able
to put aside their differences and deal with a series of sensitive issues,
maintaining favorable interaction, " Li said in a cross-strait wealth-creation
forum held by the Want Want China Times Group.</P>
      <P>According to Li, the "twin engine" of exchanges and negotiations are driving
cross-strait relations in the direction of peaceful development. He said cross-
strait ties are in their best shape for 60 years and are experiencing a "golden
period" in which various cross-strait exchanges and cooperation programs are
deepening.</P>
      <P>He predicted that the two sides will together meet new challenges and
opportunities to be brought by the global economic recovery, technological
progress and adjustment of industrial structure.</P>
      <P>In a subsequent meeting with his Taiwanese counterpart, Straits Exchange
Foundation Vice Chairman Kao Koong-lian, Li again stressed the importance of
Taiwan and China agreeing to disagree on divisive issues to allow for win-win
resolutions.</P>
      <P>In line with this spirit, Beijing has been sticking to the "1992 consensus," he
told reporters.</P>
      <P>There was speculation that Li mentioned the "1992 consensus" in response to
recent discussions about China's military deployments targeting Taiwan.</P>
      <P>On July 30, China's Defense Ministry proposed that the removal of missiles
targeting Taiwan will be a negotiable issue under the "one China" principle.
Taiwan, however, later responded by urging Beijing to take the initiative in
removing the missiles based on the "1992 consensus."</P>

      <P>The 2010 Taipei International Flora Expo, which is scheduled to open in
November, will generate an estimated NT$16.8 billion (US$525 million) in
economic benefits, a Taipei City official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Of that amount, an estimated NT$2.8 billion will come directly from ticket
sales, corporate sponsorships, and royalties, said Chen Hsiung-wen, director of
the Taipei City Government's Department of Economic Development and chief
executive officer of the Flora Expo.</P>
      <P>"Ticket sales alone are likely to reach an estimated NT$1.36 billion, as 7.2
million Taiwan residents and 800,000 foreign citizens are expected to visit the
exhibition," Chen said.</P>
      <P>In addition, an additional NT$14 billion will be generated indirectly from
taxes, the flower industry, and the hospitality industry which is forecast to
see benefits of NT$11.2 billion during the five-month exhibition period, Chen
said.</P>
      <P>"The expo will help boost annual production in the flower industry by 22
percent, as compared to 2008, because more than 90 percent of the flowers, herbs
and other plants on display at the event will be locally grown," Chen said,</P>
      <P>About 30 million stems of 3,300 floral or herbal varieties are expected to be on
display at the exhibition, which will be held Nov. 6, 2010 to April 25, 2011 in

      <P>Airtac International Group, a Chinese automation control equipment maker, has
filed an application with the Taiwan Stock Exchange (TWSE) for primary listing,
the exchange said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Airtac has become the fourth foreign company to seek a stock offering on
Taiwan's main board so far this year, the TWSE said.</P>
      <P>Airtac, a Cayman Islands-registered firm capitalized at NT$1.33 billion
(US$41.85) , is planning to issue 17 million new shares for the listing at NT$80
per share and expects to raise NT$1.36 billion, according to the company's
prospectus.</P>
      <P>The company is expected to use the funds to expand its global production  and
marketing  network and raise its research and development workforce, the
prospectus says.</P>
      <P>The prospectus adds that the company expects the fundraising will be completed
by the end of the fourth quarter.</P>
      <P>Airtac is currently running production facilities in China that account for
almost 90 percent of its total revenue. The company ranks as China's second-
largest pneumatic equipment supplier, with a 13 percent market share, behind
Japan's SMC Corp.</P>
      <P>Apart from China, where the company operates 31 marketing units, its has set up
a distribution network outside China, selling its products in Asia, Europe and
the Americas.</P>
      <P>Currently, the company has 2,600 employees globally, including more than 500
working in the technical and engineering sector.</P>
      <P>In 2009, Airtac posted NT$550 million in net profits, up 32 percent from a year
earlier, with earnings per share (EPS) at NT$7.1.</P>
      <P>In the first half of this year, its net profits hit NT$542 million, with EPS at
NT$4.07.</P>
      <P>In May, U.S.-based integrated circuit designer Integrated Memory Logic Inc. was
listed on the TWSE, making it the first and only foreign company to launch a
primary listing on the main board.</P>
      <P>The exchange said about 50 foreign companies have expressed interest in making a
primary listing on the main board after years of government efforts to promote
Taiwan as a fundraising site for overseas investors.</P>

      <P>It was not some celebrity chef, but President Ma Ying-jeou wearing an apron and
a cook's cap, who could be seen concentrating on knocking four moon cakes out of
a wooden mold before sending them into the oven in front of the media cameras
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Showing off the cakes he made, Ma touted traditional moon cakes produced by more
than 20 social welfare groups and organizations countrywide that shelter and
offer vocational training to physically and mentally challenged people.</P>
      <P>Ma launched a "shopping with love" campaign along with Minister</P>
      <P>of the Interior Jiang Yi-huah earlier in the day, urging the public to purchase
moon cakes from the social welfare groups to celebrate the upcoming Mid-Autumn
Festival on the 15th day of the eighth lunar month, which will fall on Sept. 22
this year.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan's love is infinite, " Ma said, adding that since an amendment to the
People with Disabilities Rights Protection Act took effect in July 2009 that
requires certain public- and private-sector companies and organizations to
employ people with disabilities, those companies have been hiring more people
with disabilities that they are required to.</P>
      <P>Every year, local social welfare organizations produce and market their versions
of moon cakes -- a traditional delicacy given as gifts and consumed at mid-
Autumn Festival feasts -- as part of efforts to increase the revenues of the
organizations.</P>
      <P>In 2009, prompted by promotion by the media and the government, the social
welfare cakes were reportedly a big hit.</P>

    <DATELINE>08/11/10  18:32:23
(Business Weekly 1184)(translated by Kay Liu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>It can be difficult to crack Japan -- Asia's most developed market -- but some
Taiwanese businesses still choose this challenging path to strengthen their
brands.</P>
      <P>Hung Ya-ling, secretary-general of the Taiwan Chain Stores and Franchise
Association, said that Japan is challenging because the market is relatively
closed to foreign companies.</P>
      <P>As consumers there have more trust in products and services provided by Japanese
businesses, even American and European retailers have difficulties making
inroads, Hung said.</P>
      <P>Giant, the international bicycle producer from Taiwan, did not open its own
branded store in Japan until 2007 even though the company has had a branch there
since 1989.</P>
      <P>The company now owns four stores in Japan, the latest of which opened in Tokyo
this year, and some 2,000 shops sell its bicycles throughout the country.</P>
      <P>Lee Jui-fa, head of Giant's Japan branch, said the company is already the
biggest high-end bicycle importer in Japan.</P>
      <P>Lee said Giant sees its overseas branches as the extension of the supply chain
it has been building over 20 years. Five of its 58 employees in Japan are
responsible for local market research and product development.</P>
      <P>For the next two decades, however, the company intends to compile knowledge of
distribution in mature markets such as Japan to enhance its core ability of
global brand management, Lee said.</P>
      <P>Sinyi Realty, on the other hand, entered Japan to improve management of its
service while eyeing future expansion in China with its Japanese partners.</P>
      <P>Sinyi Chairman Chou Chun-chi said the company would not have made the move to
open a store in Tokyo without the help of Japan's Orix Corp. and Daikyo Inc.,
both of which are major companies listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.</P>
      <P>Chou said the company was using its resources to develop long-term synergy with
Orix and Daikyo before entering China together, rather than focusing on staking
out market share in secondary Chinese cities now.</P>
      <P>Chen Yen-hung, general manager of Sinyi's Japan company, said that as Japanese
customers are not familiar with the brand, its operation is taking a less risky
approach by selling properties from its Japanese partners to buyers from China
and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Picking a tough market is a long-term investment to strengthen a company's brand
and raise its standard of service. For Taiwanese companies used to exploring
overseas markets on their own while worrying their products or business models
will be copied, it can be a strategy worth considering.</P>

      <P>An 11-month-old Hong Kong girl who needed the help of an artificial respirator
to stay alive had an operation in Taiwan early this month that restored her
breathing -- and her life -- to normal, Taipei Veterans General Hospital said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Soong Wen-jue, chief director of the hospital's Pediatrics Department, said the
girl underwent a one-hour operation on Aug. 4, during which she had a tracheal
stent implanted to help her breathe normally.</P>
      <P>The girl was born with a number of medical problems, including curvature of the
spine, or scoliosis, a completely non-functional right lung and stenosis, or
narrowing, of the trachea leading to the left lung, which was corrected by the
stent.</P>
      <P>She had been on a respirator in a Hong Kong hospital for the previous six
months, and her doctor finally decided to send her to Taiwan via an
International SOS plane for the tracheal stent procedure at Veterans General,
which he had heard about at a medical seminar in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Soong said the girl will be able to return to Hong Kong in the coming days and
lead a healthy life, though with slightly weakened stamina. She will also
require periodic examinations to make sure the stent is working properly.</P>
      <P>Taipei Veterans General Hospital is famous for its tracheal stent procedure for
youngsters, which was developed in Taiwan 12 years ago.</P>

      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih on Wednesday said he supported the Central Taiwan Science
Park's view that a court ruling to halt work at the park's Houli and Erlin
expansion sites does not apply to companies that have already begun operating
there.</P>
      <P>Wu said the park believes, based on the principle of legitimate expectation,
that the injunction should not penalize any bona fide third party, referring to
the private companies.</P>
      <P>"I support such an interpretation, " he said, arguing that if the court order
challenges a bona fide third party, it could hurt the people's trust of the
country.</P>
      <P>The Taipei High Administrative Court found in separate rulings in July that all
development work at the Houli and Erlin sites had to be stopped until further
environmental impact assessments were conducted and approved.</P>
      <P>The park administration narrowly interpreted the ruling, agreeing to stop work
on the two sites' infrastructure development but opting against shutting down
companies that had already started production or were in the process of building
their plants at the Houli site.</P>
      <P>No companies had begun moving into the Erlin site at the time of the court's
ruling.</P>
      <P>"If the interpretation of the injunction were to be significantly expanded, the
judge would be caught in an injustice, " the premier said, referring to the idea
of stopping company operations.</P>
      <P>Wu contended that the principle of legitimate expectation -- the idea that
expectations raised as a result of administrative conduct may have legal
consequences -- is an important constitutional foundation of countries governed
by the rule of law, and if the principle is shaken, a constitutional crisis
could occur.</P>
      <P>Though the premier backed the park administration's  move, opposition Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) legislators strongly criticized it, saying all
construction and production should be halted.</P>
      <P>Huang Sue-ying, a DPP legislator said at a press conference Wednesday that if
the government ignores the court's order, it will be hard for justice to be
served.</P>
      <P>The Environmental Protection Administration  (EPA)  and the National Science
Council, which were also cited as not fulfilling their duties in the court's
ruling, filed a joint appeal against the court's verdict on Monday.</P>
      <P>The appeal argues that the panel of judges made the decision without taking
expert opinions into consideration.</P>

      <P>The Council of Agriculture (COA) unveiled Wednesday a new variety of rice that
it said is highly resistant to rice blast disease and will therefore have high
yield and low production costs.</P>
      <P>The Tainung No. 84 variety was produced after more than eight years of effort by
the Chiayi Agricultural Experimental Station of the COA's Agricultural Research
Institute,  said the station's director Yang Hung-jen.</P>
      <P>"Rice blast disease is one of the most destructive to rice crops but the new
variety is strongly resistant to the disease," Yang said.</P>
      <P>Rice blast disease causes the plants to wither and die.</P>
      <P>In an experiment conducted in the first half of this year, earlier developed
varieties  of rice required  five to seven insecticide treatments, while the
Tainung No. 84 required none, he said.</P>
      <P>"Our statistics show that the yield of the Tainung No.84 is about 10 percent
higher than the Taikeng No. 2 and Taikeng No. 9, " Yang said.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Tainung No. 84's high resistance to rice blast disease will
help farmers to cut costs, he said. It is also environmentally friendly as there
is no need for insecticides, he said.</P>
      <P>The Taikeng No.2 and No.9 are the two most popular rice varieties on the
domestic market. However, Yang said, the larger grains of the Tainung No. 84
will attract consumers when the new variety hits the market.</P>
      <P>"More importantly, it tastes good. It is as delicious as the Taikeng No. 9,
which many consumers have rated well for quality, " Yang said.</P>
      <P>Yang said the COA is planning to promote the Tainung No.84 to farmers and is
willing to grant them free license to grow the new variety.</P>

      <P>Representatives of the film industry gathered at the Legislative  Yuan Wednesday
to push for the implementation of a recent agreement between Taiwan and China on
intellectual property rights (IPR) protection.</P>
      <P>Chu Yen-ping, director of the popular Taiwanese movies "A Home Too Far" and
"Kung-Fu Kids, " said he had been hit hard by rampant piracy in China.</P>
      <P>Chu said that pirated versions of his movies, including his latest productions
"Kung Fu Dunk" and "The Treasure Hunter, " spread through the China market
before his movies even debuted.</P>
      <P>"The film industry is gravely wounded by piracy, " said Chu, adding that he
hopes authorities from both sides of the strait will protect the industry by
resolving problems related to piracy.</P>
      <P>Lee Ruei-bin, chief executive of Taiwan Recording Industry Foundation, said that
although Taiwanese popular music's share of China's market exceeds 70 percent,
protective measures are weak and inadequate.</P>
      <P>The verification  of legitimate  products  in China is so time-consuming it
encourages piracy, Lee said, stressing the urgency to institutionalize the IPR
agreement.</P>
      <P>Lee said that implementing the agreement would allow for the establishment of an
effective communication platform to deal with disputes  over  cross-strait  IPR
application,  protection  and infringement.</P>
      <P>In response, Vice Minister of Economic Affairs Francis Kuo-hsin Liang said that
IPR protection is fundamental to Taiwan's knowledge economy and that the

      <P>Taiwan's top economic planner and ruling Kuomintang (KMT) Honorary Chairman Lien
Chan both said Wednesday that the economic cooperation framework agreement
(ECFA) Taiwan signed with China last month will benefit both sides and breathe
new life into industries on both sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) Chairwoman Christina Liu
said at a cross-strait economic forum that the ECFA is expected to help improve
Taiwan's economic structure and allow industries on both sides to complement
each other.</P>
      <P>Because Asian countries, most of which are reliant on exports, were hit hard by
the 2008-2009 financial crisis, they should adjust their economic and industrial
structures now that the troubles are over, to avoid another financial meltdown,
Liu said.</P>
      <P>She noted that there is a clear trend that the industries Taiwan has prioritized
for development are almost the same as those to which China has given priority
for promotion. These industries include green energy,  electric cars, green
architecture,  medical and healthcare, culture, innovation and education.</P>
      <P>Liu added, therefore, that the two sides should think about how to cooperate in
developing these industries and help the industries on both sides to complement
each other and create mutual benefits.</P>
      <P>Citing the advantages each side has to offer, Liu said that in addition to its
vast market, China offers abundant opportunities at a time when it is making
great efforts in infrastructure development, while Taiwan has strong "soft
power."</P>
      <P>Taking as an example the Taiwanese businesses operating in China, Liu said that
RT-Mart International Ltd., a Taiwanese retail brand that entered China in 1997,
has become a famous chain in China by using Taiwan's "soft power."</P>
      <P>With the warming relations between the two sides and the allowing of Chinese
investment  in Taiwan,  factors that hindered  the development of Taiwan's
industries and hurt its people's livelihoods in the past have been removed,
according to Liu.</P>
      <P>She also said Taiwan is working hard to solicit  foreign investment and
expressed hope that more investors from China, the United States and Europe will
invest in Taiwan now that the ECFA has been signed.</P>
      <P>Lien for his part said Taiwan is entering a "golden era" thanks to the ECFA
signing because it is expected to help bring numerous business opportunities and
revitalize industries on both sides of the strait.</P>
      <P>He said the ECFA will help reverse Taiwan's economic slump over the past decade,
allow the country to compete with other countries in the world on an equal
footing and enhance cross-strait mutual trust and cooperation.</P>
      <P>On the benefits the ECFA will bring for Taiwan, Lien said it will help boost
Taiwan's economy and exports, adding that Taiwan will be in an even better
position after it further completes agreements with China on trade in products,
trade in services and investment guarantees.</P>
      <P>The KMT honorary chairman also said the ECFA will not only be good for Taiwanese
businesses seeking to expand their global reach but will also help attract
foreign investment to Taiwan, lay the foundation for Taiwan to establish
economic cooperation agreements with its trade partners and even make Taiwan an
Asia-Pacific economic and trade hub.</P>
      <P>Lien said business opportunities are already emerging in the wake of the ECFA
signing. For example, tariff exemptions and preferential market treatment for
hundreds of products and services under the ECFA's "early harvest" lists are
expected to attract more overseas Taiwanese businesses to re-invest in Taiwan,
he said.</P>
      <P>Now that the ECFA has been signed, he added, Taiwan should focus more on
exploring China's domestic market, as China is mapping out its 12th five-year
economic plan, which means that its domestic demand is expected to grow.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Second TSU ECFA referendum proposal rejected by review committee</HEADLINE>

      <P>The Referendum Screening Committee under the Executive Yuan voted down a second
referendum  initiative Wednesday on across-Taiwan Strait trade deal on the
grounds that it did not conform with the law.</P>
      <P>Members of the committee reached the decision on the referendum proposal,
submitted by the opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU), by a vote of 10-2.
Thirteen of the 21-member committee attended the meeting.</P>
      <P>The proposed referendum would ask the public: "Do you agree that the government
should sign an economic cooperation  framework agreement (ECFA) with China?"</P>
      <P>Although this is the second time the proposal has been rejected, TSU Chairman
Huang Kun-huei said the party was planning to submit another referendum
proposal.</P>
      <P>On June 3, 19 members of the committee in attendance rejected the first proposal
by a vote of 12-4 after a marathon debate, saying that the reason given for
proposing the referendum did not match its proposed content. The committee said
the TSU's stated reason for the proposal was to ask whether the government had
the right to sign the ECFA, but the referendum question pertained to the
contents of the agreement.</P>
      <P>The TSU submitted another proposal in late June with the same proposed question
but new reasons, stressing that because the ECFA is a major government policy,
it should be voted on by the public.</P>
      <P>However, Chao Yung-mao, chairperson of the committee, said at a press conference
Wednesday that the committee decided the referendum question as stated did not
involve changing major policies as required by the Referendum Act.</P>
      <P>Chao said that there were "procedural issues" with the proposal because it
questioned the signing of the ECFA after the agreement had already been signed.</P>
      <P>Chao also pointed out that although the referendum sponsor was against the ECFA,
the question was expressed positively. The referendum should have been phrased
negatively, he said, so that if passed it would force the government to act.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan said in a press release that it respected the decision made
by the committee. It also stressed that signing the ECFA with China on June 29
not only benefited Taiwan's industries but also ensured Taiwan will enjoy more
opportunities  for future development.</P>

      <P>Beijing Olympics gold medalist Brazil highlights the four-team World Grand Prix
Taipei 2010 that will be played in Taiwan on Aug. 20, a rare chance for local
volleyball fans to see the best in the sport.</P>
      <P>Brazil, Taiwan, Puerto Rico and Poland will play a round robin at the National
Taiwan University Sports Center in Taipei from Aug. 20-22 as part of this year's
World Grand Prix, organizer Chinese Taipei Volleyball Association (CTVA) said
Wednesday at a press conference.</P>
      <P>The World Grand Prix is an annual women's volleyball competition of 12 teams,
four each from America, Europe and Asia.</P>
      <P>It consists of two phases -- a preliminary round with a system of rotating host
cities and one or more final rounds with one or more host nations.</P>
      <P>In this year's event, the preliminary round spans three weeks, with the top six
teams qualifying for the final round.</P>
      <P>Taiwan, which is appearing in the event for the third time ever and the first
time since 2007, has high hopes after being added to the event as a replacement
for South Korea, which decided not to enter the Grand Prix this year, said CTVA
secretary-general Chang Chin-jong.</P>
      <P>The CTVA's main goal is for the Taiwan women's  national volleyball team to
finish in the top three in the biennial Asian championships -- the most
important event aside from the Olympic Games to local sports administrators --
something Taiwan has never done.</P>
      <P>The CTVA hoped to change that when it hired respected Japanese head coach
Norimasa Sakakuchi to coach the women's junior team in 2006.</P>
      <P>Sakakuchi coached the juniors to a fourth place at the Asian Junior
Championships in 2006 and to a bronze medal finish in the same tournament two
years later before taking over the national team.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan's national side could only manage a sixth-place finish at the
Asian Women's Championships in 2009, it continues to train eight months every
year and hopes for better performances in major competitions in the future,
Chang said.</P>
      <P>But it will not be easy, as seen in Taiwan's performance in the first round of
this year's Grand Prix. It lost consecutive matches to Brazil, Italy and Japan
in Brazil this past weekend, failing to win a set.</P>
      <P>Yet Chang remains optimistic that Taiwan can eventually stand on the podium in
an Asian Championships.</P>
      <P>"If we work hard, the goal is not impossible, seen by Taiwan's surprising
fourth-place finish in last week's 2010 Asian Men's Volleyball Championships,"
he said.</P>
      <P>The CTVA hopes that the appearance of Brazil will attract more local fans, Chang
said. Brazil has proved that it has replaced Cuba as the superpower in women's
volleyball through its dominance in Beijing and by winning the last two and five
of the last six Grand Prix.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is scheduled to meet 2009 European Championship bronze medalist Poland on
Aug. 20, Brazil on Aug. 21, and Puerto Rico, ranked 14th in the world on Aug. 22
in Taipei.</P>
      <P>The top five teams in the preliminary round and host China will enter the final
round, which will be played from Aug. 25-29 in Ningbo, China.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cross-Strait Agreement Watch alliance launched a campaign on Wednesday
urging Taiwan's people to support adding human rights and environmental
provisions to the trade agreement Taiwan and China signed in late June.</P>
      <P>The group announced the campaign at a forum it held to review and discuss the
cross-Taiwan  Strait economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA), which will
initially cut or eliminate tariffs on a relatively limited number of goods
shipped between the two countries.</P>
      <P>The alliance of 30 academic and civic organizations, dedicated to monitoring
agreements Taiwan's government has signed with Beijing, argued that the trade
pact totally "ignored" the country's growing environmental consciousness.</P>
      <P>The accord also did not cover any human rights principles, even though China has
a notorious human rights record, the alliance said.</P>
      <P>Hsu Szu-chien, an assistant research fellow in Academia Sinica's Institute of
Political Science, reminded the administration of President Ma Ying-jeou to
propose more human rights provisions as it moves to sign agreements with Beijing
that boost economic and trade exchanges.</P>
      <P>He pointed, for example, to biotechnology-related sectors, where clinical
research, human testing, and the establishment of tissue sample databanks  all
involve medical  ethics,  the rights of disadvantaged people, and the protection
of the identity of those participating in medical trials.</P>
      <P>Hsu said that after the signing of a memorandum of understanding on cross-strait
financial cooperation and supervision last November, the government should
further establish a mechanism to ensure the confidentiality of personal
information and business data.</P>
      <P>"The consequences of having business and individual credit data seized by China
for special purposes is unimaginable," Hsu warned.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Control Yuan report questions legality of 1949 martial laws</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 11 (CNA)
08/11/10  20:56:01

    <TEXT>
      <P>Members of Taiwan's highest watchdog body questioned on Wednesday the legality
of the martial laws proclaimed in 1949, calling into question rulings based on
the laws that included jail sentences and the confiscation of property.</P>
      <P>Taiwan was under the rule of martial law for 38 years before it was lifted on
July 15, 1987.</P>
      <P>Liu Hsing-shan, one of three members of the Control Yuan who completed an
investigative report on martial law, said that the Kuomintang-led Nationalist
government proclaimed a series of martial laws three times between 1948 and
1949. The last, declared on Nov. 22, 1949, specifically put the entire Taiwan
area under martial law.</P>
      <P>The Nationalist government moved to Taiwan in 1949 after losing a civil war
against Chinese communists.</P>
      <P>The last group of martial laws put in place did not include the signature of
then acting President Lee Tsung-jen, who fled directly from the mainland to the
United States before the Chinese Communist Party took total control of China.</P>
      <P>Lee took over as acting president of the Republic of China after Chiang Kai-shek
stepped down as head of state on Jan. 21, 1949, following a series of setbacks
in battles against Communist troops.</P>
      <P>Liu and Control Yuan members Huang Huang-hsiung and Yeh Yao-peng spent one year
completing the investigation after receiving appeals from former Legislator
Hsieh Tsung-min and others who said they were wrongly jailed or had property
confiscated.</P>
      <P>"We are not sure whether the martial laws were invalid, but we think they might
have been flawed, and the answer can only be given by the Constitutional Court,"
Liu said.</P>
      <P>"If the court deems they were illegal because (they did not include the
signature of the president) , then the legality of military court rulings that
jailed suspected 'Communist spies or traitors'  and confiscated  their property
might  have to be reconsidered as a result," he added.</P>
      <P>Liu however, ruled out the possibility of the Control Yuan taking the initiative
to ask for a constitutional interpretation on the issue.</P>
      <P>"It's up to those who suffered from the martial laws, or their descendants,  to
decide whether to apply for a constitutional interpretation," he said.</P>
      <P>Huang said that dealing with the issues would be a severe challenge to the
government as President Ma Ying-jeou has stressed his commitment to the
protection of human rights. Ma incorporated a pair of United Nations covenants
-- the International Covenant on Civil Rights and Political Rights and the
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights -- into domestic
law on May 14, 2009.</P>
      <P>Hsieh lauded the move by the three Control Yuan members as "courageous" and
tantamount to "the first human footstep on the moon, as no one over the past
decades has dared to touch the highly sensitive martial laws issue."</P>
      <P>Hsieh, who also served as a presidential adviser under former President Chen
Shui-bian, failed in his bid last year to appeal for a constitutional
interpretation on the legality of the martial laws.</P>
      <P>"I will call on all the sufferers of the martial laws to sue the grand judges
who turned down my last appeal, and then to ask again for a constitutional
ruling on the issue," he added.</P>

      <P>The Control Yuan censured the Ministry of Justice (MOJ) on Wednesday over a
delay in processing a request to help a former Taiwanese intelligence agent
receive medical leave from a Chinese prison.</P>
      <P>Wang Chang-yung suffered a stroke while imprisoned in China on Dec. 20, 2009,
and his family wanted him to receive medical treatment in Taiwan under a cross-
strait judicial cooperation agreement.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Justice received the application on Dec. 25 and issued a "very
urgent" reply to the family on Jan. 18, 2010 asking for a consent letter signed
by Wang himself to process the document.</P>
      <P>Wang had died of complications from the stroke on Jan. 5.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Justice said in a press release that there was no information
regarding Wang's critical condition in the application.</P>
      <P>The Control Yuan, however, said that the family had attached a notice of
critical illness issued by a hospital in Putian in Fujian Province, China on
Dec. 21, 2009.</P>
      <P>In the correction report, the Control Yuan said the Ministry of Justice
overlooked the importance of the matter and later attempted to cover up its
mistake.</P>

      <P>Taiwanese singing sensation Lin Yu-chun met Grammy Award-winning record
producer-songwriter Walter Afanasieff Tuesday and gave the first public
performance of a song the latter wrote for him.</P>
      <P>Afanasieff praised Lin -- who arrived in Los Angeles Monday to make an
appearance on the popular NBC talent scout show "America's Got Talent" -- for
his vocal skills and music talent after listening to him sing "Under Your
Wings."</P>
      <P>Afansieff, who was born to Russian parents, said language is never a hindrance
to music. He also said that with all of his maternal relatives born in China, he
has special feelings for singers of Chinese descent.</P>
      <P>Afanasieff, who has worked with some of the biggest pop music names in the past
decades, most notably Mariah Carey, said he found Lin had successfully  learned
his vocal skills from the most outstanding pop singers of the older generation,
a feat that distinguishes him from many younger singers who have to rely on
computerized acoustic technologies when recording.</P>
      <P>Describing Lin's version of "Under Your Wings" as beautiful, Afanasieff said Lin
has a youthful and resounding voice that allows him to sing enchantingly and
passionately.</P>
      <P>He advised Lin to be more self-confident, saying he is more gifted than many of
his peers. According to Afanasieff, Lin should more confidently convey to his
fans "this is me" through his captivating singing.</P>
      <P>Lin, who vaulted to fame in April with his rendition of the Whitney Houston
version of "I Will Always Love You" on a Taiwanese talent show, said his
excitement at having the opportunity to collaborate with Afanasieff is beyond
description.</P>
      <P>"I loved the song immediately after hearing it," Lin said. "It is full of
feeling. It didn't take me long to get into the song and the recording has gone
smoothly so far."</P>
      <P>Lin signed a record deal with Sony Music in mid-May and his first album is
scheduled to be released this fall.</P>
      <P>This is his third visit to Los Angeles in less than half a year.</P>
      <P>He first visited the city in April to appear on two talk-variety shows, The
Ellen DeGeneres Show and Lopez Tonight. His renditions of several popular songs
during the appearances captivated American audiences.</P>
      <P>He was back in the city in May to perform at Dodger Stadium in a "This Is My
Town" promotion run by the Los Angeles Dodgers to honor Taiwanese fans.</P>
      <P>"Although this is my third visit, I'm still very excited and feel kind of
nervous, " the 24-year-old said.</P>
      <P>Lin said he will spend most of his time in his hotel practising the songs he
plans to sing on the NBC show.</P>
      <P>Lin said his sudden fame would make him work even harder, not only so that more
Taiwanese get to know him, but also to help more foreigners get to know Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lin, nicknamed "Chubby" for his weight, vaulted to fame after a video showing
him singing "I Will Always Love You" was posted on YouTube on April 6. The clip,
from his performance on a Taiwanese talent show called "Million Star, "
immediately went viral and quickly brought him heavy media coverage in Taiwan.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Wednesday that the government will not turn its back
on agriculture, but will help the traditional sector transform and become a
"rising sun" industry.</P>
      <P>"Agriculture has a very important ecological function. It is the source of food,
" Ma said during a meeting in the Presidential Office with leaders of farmland
irrigation associations from around Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Ma said that the government had taken premium agriculture as one of the emerging
industries  in the country that are entitled to governmental efforts to promote
their expansion.</P>
      <P>Ma mentioned the "small farmland owners, big sharecroppers" policy adopted in
2009 to encourage young people to farm while offering a chance for old farmers
to enjoy a relaxing retirement by renting out their farmland.</P>
      <P>According to the policy, within the four-year period through 2012, the
government will assist people who want to rent farms or expand existing farms
through renting.</P>
      <P>Ma said that the policy has helped 562 people become "big sharecroppers" and
7,322 retired farmers become "small landlords."</P>
      <P>Thanks to the policy, fallow farmland can be put to use again and young,
professional farmers also have the chance to expand farms with modernized
marketing approaches, Ma added.</P>
      <P>According to the Council of Agriculture, there are about 220,000 hectares of

      <P>A documentary about Dr. Sun Yat-sen -- the Republic of China's founding father
-- will not follow the pattern of deifying political figures but instead
accurately reflect history, a Council for Cultural Affairs (CCA) official said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>"Although the documentary  will be shot with a humanistic perspective instead of
idolizing or deifying the protagonist, the project will be handled with a
serious attitude, and the film will be an accurate reflection of history, " CCA
Minister Emile Sheng said at a hastily called news conference.</P>
      <P>The CCA has set aside a budget to finance the documentary as part of the
celebrations for the Republic of China's 100th anniversary in 2011.</P>
      <P>But even though the project's production team has yet to be chosen, the
documentary has already been hit by controversy.</P>
      <P>Hu Fo, an Academia Sinica academician, and Chou Yang-shan, a former professor
who is now a Control Yuan member, sent letters to a major local daily
criticizing  the CCA and the ROC Centenary Foundation for what they described as
a "frivolous and insolent" mentality in handling the project.</P>
      <P>Chou cautioned the CCA that if the documentary deviates from historical facts or
is full of mistakes, it will face censure by the Control Yuan, the highest
monitor of government behavior.</P>
      <P>Sheng said the duo's concerns may have arisen from remarks made by Ping Lu, an
adviser of the ROC Centenary Foundation, who said during an informal meeting
with local reporters last week that in her opinion, Sun was a figure whom "even
Vladimir Lenin would have ridiculed as naive and innocent."</P>
      <P>"Ping Lu is free to have her own opinion of Sun. She is not the producer of the
documentary about him, " Sheng said. He added that the foundation had no plan to
strip Ping Lu of her advisory post.</P>
      <P>Sheng, who concurrently serves as the centenary foundation's CEO, said the CCA
will select a professional production crew to shoot a high-quality documentary
on the country's founding father.</P>
      <P>The CCA is scheduled to post its open tender on its website between late August
and early September to solicit submissions. The winning production team will
have to complete the project by Oct. 31, 2011.</P>

      <P>Kang said that Japan recently apologized for colonizing Korea, and she asked
Tokyo to treat former Taiwanese comfort women equally by offering them an
official apology.</P>
      <P>Of the 58 Taiwan ex-comfort women who came forward to make formal complaints by
the end of 1992, 44 had already died without receiving an apology, Kang said.</P>
      <P>The Taiwanese government should include information about comfort women in
textbooks to let future generations know of the historical tragedy, Kang added.</P>
      <P>The foundation called for more public awareness of the issue and said that it
will continue to hold annual protest rallies.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Kuo on Taiwan's preliminary roster for Asian Games baseball tourney</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Los Angeles Dodgers All-Star pitcher Kuo Hung-chih has been listed Taiwan's
preliminary 45-man roster for the Asian Games, which was made public by Taiwan's
baseball association Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The left-hander  headlined  a roster dominated  by players performing in the
United States at the major league and minor league levels.</P>
      <P>The Chinese Taipei Baseball Association (CTBA) is still unsure, however, if Kuo
will be able to join the team in Guangzhou, China in November.</P>
      <P>It will not be easy for the Dodgers to make Kuo available for the tournament
because of his injury-prone past, said national team manager Yeh Chih-hsien.</P>
      <P>The 29-year-old Kuo is enjoying the best season of his six-year Major League
Baseball career. As the Dodgers' main set-up man, he has a 3-1 record with three
saves and a 1.41 ERA in 36 appearances.</P>
      <P>The possibility of being rejected by the Dodgers or other clubs to release
Taiwanese players for the Asian Games has not stopped the CTBA from trying to
put together a strong roster.</P>
      <P>"We're still planning to recruit the best players available for the Asian Games,
" Yeh said.</P>
      <P>Twenty of the 45 players on the roster are currently playing in foreign leagues.
Brother Elephants slugger Peng Cheng-min is among 18 players  from the Taiwan's
professional  league,  the Chinese Professional Baseball League, while seven are
amateurs.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's recruiting strategy reflects its determination to defend its Asian
Games title. It has pursued every Taiwanese player performing at a Class
A-Advanced League level or higher, with the exceptions of Washington Nationals
pitcher Wang Chien-ming and one other minor leaguer.</P>
      <P>The CTBA is scheduled to name its 24-player roster to participate in the 2010
Intercontinental Cup tournament, which will be played in Taiwan in October,
before deciding the final roster for the Asian Games.</P>
      <P>Taiwan won its first baseball gold at the Asian games in Doha, Qatar in 2006.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Nuclear plant discharge killing coral in Kenting area: researcher</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Thermal discharge from a nuclear power plant in southern Taiwan is behind the
rapid destruction of Kenting National Park's coral reef, a marine researcher
said Wednesday, and he warned the reef's disappearance would jeopardize Taiwan's
fishing industry and national security.</P>
      <P>Allan Chen, a research fellow with Academia Sinica's Research Centre for
Biodiversity, said the Maanshan Nuclear Power Plant owned by state-run Taiwan
Power Company has sped up the deterioration of corals by emitting thermal
discharge that has driven local seawater temperatures 1.5 to 2 degrees Celsius
higher over the past 26 years.</P>
      <P>Because of this and other anthropogenic disturbances, the number of coral types
has fallen from 20-30 26 years ago to three today, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is rich in corals. Except for the sandy area of western Taiwan, various
types of coral reefs can be found around the island and even off the outlying
island of Penghu, where the water temperature has shot up by 1.09 degrees
Celsius in recent years.</P>
      <P>Dubbed as the rain forests of the ocean by scientists, coral reefs are
considered the most important marine ecosystem in the world for the fishing
industry, tourism, culture, medicinal purposes and coastline protection, Chen
noted.</P>
      <P>According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) , although
corals cover less than one percent of the world's oceans, they serve as the
homes and feeding areas of one-third of globally known marine species.</P>
      <P>Chen's research shows that Taiwan's seawater temperature peaked between the
1970s and the 1980s, in line with global trends. In the last six decades, the
average temperature of Taiwan's seawater has risen 0.79 degrees Celsius,
slightly higher than the 0.5 degrees Celsius experienced by other tropical sea
regions in the world.</P>
      <P>Scientists have warned that if global warming continues at its current pace, the
world's coral reefs will completely disintegrate by the end of the century in
2010.</P>
      <P>In addition to industrial waste, overfishing, pollution, ocean acidification and
typhoons all contribute to the destruction and bleaching of corals in Taiwan,
Chen said.</P>
      <P>He explained the current live coral coverage rate in Kenting is approximately 70
percent, roughly the same as in 1986, but he stressed that the rate could be a
misleading indicator because coverage rate does not mean the live corals are
fully functioning.</P>
      <P>"It is like tearing down a multifunctional high-rise building like Taipei 101
and replacing the area with one-story houses. You lose most of the original
diversity and functionality," he said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, in northern Taiwan, a group of rare soft corals was recently
discovered off the coast of Taipei County's Rueifang Township.</P>
      <P>Wang Min-hsiang, a diving instructor who made the discovery, described the area
as an underwater "crystal palace, " but he feared the ecosystem will be doomed
if plans to build a coal-handling wharf near the site is allowed to proceed.</P>
      <P>Taipower has proposed to build a 1,464-meter pier to handle shipments of the
coal used by a nearby thermal power plant, according to local media reports.</P>
      <P>Local residents have vehemently objected to the plan, but Taipower President Lee
Han-shen said the concerns are unnecessary at the moment because the plan is
still under review.</P>

      <P>Opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen denounced
on Wednesday a committee that rejected a referendum initiative on a Taiwan-China
trade pact as "the ruling party's tool to suppress Taiwan's democracy."</P>
      <P>"Taiwan's democratic system has suffered another major setback, " Tsai said in a
statement after the Executive Yuan's Referendum Screening Committee made its
decision earlier Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The committee rejected by a 10-2 margin a referendum initiative proposed by the
opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) on the economic cooperation framework
agreement (ECFA) , saying it did not conform with the law.</P>
      <P>Only 13 of the committee's 21 members took part in the meeting.</P>
      <P>Among the reasons given by the committee for nixing the proposed poll was that
it did not meet the requirement stipulated in the Referendum Act of changing a
major policy.</P>
      <P>But Tsai argued that the ECFA does in fact concern important policy issues that
involve the redistribution of the wealth of Taiwan's people and Taiwan's
national strategic position and thus whether to sign it should have been decided
by the people through a public referendum.</P>
      <P>Accusing the committee of overstepping its authority in defining the ECFA issue
as not being a "major political policy, " Tsai said its decision had severely
harmed people's referendum rights.</P>
      <P>She also said that the rejection exposed the flaws of the referendum system.</P>
      <P>"Conceived as part of an incorrect system, one cannot expect correct results, "
Tsai said.</P>
      <P>The party leader instructed the DPP to submit a proposal at the Legislative Yuan
to have people decide the ECFA through referendum.</P>
      <P>Under the Referendum Act, if the Legislative Yuan thinks it is necessary to
carry out a referendum on important policies, it can approve the referendum
proposal on its own and then have the Central Election Commission carry it out.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, former President Lee Teng-hui told the media that he was "very angry"
after learning the ECFA referendum was rejected again after first being rejected
on June 3.</P>
      <P>It shows the democracy he built during his 12-year tenure as Taiwan's president
has been lost, he said.</P>
      <P>Saying holding a referendum is a basic right protected by the Constitution,  TSU
Chairman Huang Kun-huei  said he could not understand why an agreement like the
ECFA that would have a profound influence on the country was not allowed to be
decided by the people through referendum.</P>
      <P>Huang vowed to continue to submit the proposal until it is accepted and carried

    <TEXT>
      <P>-like economic  cooperation agreement with Singapore will not be a free lunch,
but as long as Taiwan has the mettle to overhaul its economy, the deal could be
a sumptuous feast.</P>
      <P>Everybody knows Singapore is a free trade port that hardly imposes tariff
barriers on merchandise flow and also keeps its service market largely open to
foreign investors.</P>
      <P>In negotiating an FTA with Taiwan, Singapore is very likely to ask Taiwan to
offer its service providers similarly easy market access terms. Judging from its
past FTA negotiations with other countries, Singapore will also demand its
trading partners engage in regulatory reform and enhance transparency.</P>
      <P>Taiwan should be prepared to take up all these challenges and treat them as a
catalyst to modernize its economic and legal systems. Should that happen, Taiwan
will be able to largely upgrade its administrative efficiency and economic
competitiveness, and its future FTA negotiations with other countries will also
be much easier.</P>
      <P>If Taiwan can smoothly strike an FTA with Singapore and withstand the trying,
market-opening test, it will gain easier access to other ASEAN member  states
and even engage  in dialogue  with the Trans-Pacific Partnership mechanism, in
both of which Singapore plays a key role. (Editorial abstract -- Aug. 12, 2010).</P>

      <P>A lawyer and his girlfriend were taken into custody Thursday as part of a probe
into a bribery case that implicates at least one Taiwan High Court judge.</P>
      <P>The Taipei District Court agreed to a prosecutorial request to detain Chiu
Chuan-shun and his girlfriend Tuan Mei-yueh to facilitate investigations into a
bribery case involving Yang Ping-chen, a Taiwan High Court judge.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors applied for detention of Chiu and Tuan late Wednesday after
questioning  them and many others  about their alleged involvement in the
corruption case.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors and investigators raided 20 locations in major cities in northern
Taiwan Wednesday in a new drive to root out corruption in the judiciary.</P>
      <P>Among the locations searched were the residences of Yang and Chiu, a high court
spokesman said.</P>
      <P>He said that the high court fully respected the prosecutors' right to conduct

    <HEADLINE>Talk of the day -- Differences over the '1992 consensus'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>08/12/10  11:35:05
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Li Yafei, vice president of the Beijing-based semi-official Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS), said at a seminar in Taipei
Wednesday that adherence by Taiwan and China to an anti-independence stance and
the "1992 consensus" since 2008 has helped build trust and end confrontation
between the two sides.</P>
      <P>According to Li, the consensus refers to an understanding reached between Taiwan
and China in 1992 to "separately verbalize the 'one China' principle adhered to
by the two sides of the Taiwan Strait."</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from the local media coverage of the issue:</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan and China resumed dialogue based on the "1992 consensus" after
President Ma Ying-jeou's inauguration in May 2008, China has followed a policy
of deliberate ambiguity and seldom touched upon the substantive content of the
"1992 consensus."</P>
      <P>Li's "explicit statement" of Beijing's version of the "1992 consensus" raises
much attention.</P>
      <P>There are indeed differences between Taipei and Beijing on what the "1992
consensus" stands for. Taipei's version is: "The two sides of the Taiwan Strait
separately verbalize the meaning of 'one China, '" which  is known  simply  as
"one  China,  separate interpretations."</P>
      <P>Xu Bodong, a professor from Beijing Union University, said that Li made the move
because Ma and some politicians in Taiwan have mentioned "one China, separate
interpretations" on many recent occasions, although Ma says Taiwan has no
intention of discussing political issues with China.</P>
      <P>By explicating the "one China principle, " Xu argued, China was trying to remind
Taiwan to put aside their differences and reduce cross-strait conflicts. (Aug.
12, 2010).</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>Li again raised the topic while paying a visit to his Taiwan counterpart,
Straits  Exchange  Foundation  Vice Chairman  Kao Koong-lian, that same day.</P>
      <P>Li stressed the importance of the two sides putting aside their differences and
focusing on common ground so as not to upset the favorable atmosphere  for
cross-strait  dialogue or impede the development of cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>Ruling Kuomintang Deputy Secretary-General Chang Jung-kung said the fact that
the two sides have resumed dialogue based on the "1992 consensus" despite their
differences over its content "proves that the '1992 consensus' works."</P>
      <P>Chang said Taiwan and China should continue to maintain such "creative
ambiguity"  until they are ready to open political negotiations. (Aug. 12,
2010).</P>
      <P>Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>The Presidential Office declined to comment on Li's statement, while Mainland
Affairs Council Vice Chairman Liu Te-shun said his council will need to take a
closer look at Li's remarks.</P>
      <P>Officials dealing with the government's China policy, however, warned that this
could be a precursor to China's attempt to press Taiwan to enter political
negotiations, a situation to which Taiwan must react with caution. (Aug. 12,
2010).</P>

      <P>His condition deteriorated after being hospitalized, according to the sources.</P>

Tang's condition was improving before he boarded the flight in Dalian.</P>
      <P>Chinese officials responsible for Taiwanese affairs said that Tang fell ill
while traveling in Changchun, Jilin Province. He was sent to the Affiliated

    <DATELINE>08/12/10  12:40:46
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>When Premier Wu Den-yih assumed office last September, he pledged to prioritize
"ordinary people's feelings" in charting economic policy. A recent spate of
incidents, however, prompts us to ask whether the premier will side with
ordinary people or profiteering property developers.</P>
      <P>The Dapu and Siangsihliao land expropriation disputes were just the tip of an
iceberg of the "government ignoring ordinary people's rights and interests."</P>
      <P>Two other controversial cases even more tellingly betray the Executive Yuan's
compromise with property developers at the expense of ordinary people.</P>
      <P>In one of them, the government has flip-flopped on whether to include  awnings
when calculating  property  area for housing registration. The Ministry of the
Interior already decided to not include  awnings  to prevent property
developers  from unfair profiteering. After a meeting with housing industry
representatives, Wu ordered the ministry to consult with scholars and come up
with a compromise option by the end of October.</P>
      <P>Another example is the Executive Yuan's hesitation to repeal a preferential
housing floor space treatment to property developers even after the Control Yuan
censured such a measure. The Executive Yuan originally decided to cancel the 20
percent floor space incentive in three years, but now has second thoughts after
an appeal by construction companies.</P>
      <P>The government should no longer drag its feet on such issues because history
tells us only countries that base their policies on social justice have a
future. (Editorial abstract -- Aug. 12, 2010)</P>

    <HEADLINE>China Times: Article 16 of ECFA does not matter that much</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Former Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
08/12/10  13:28:33
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Chairman Shih Ming-teh recently ran a full-page advertisement in major local
dailies urging the Legislative Yuan to remove Article 16 of the Economic
Cooperation Framework Agreement (ECFA) with China.</P>
      <P>Shih said the article is a bomb that can be detonated at any time to destabilize
Taiwan and even force it to cave in to China's political blackmail on
unification.</P>
      <P>The article stipulates that either side can serve notice on the other that it
wishes to terminate the agreement and if the two sides fail to resolve the
points of contentionwithin 30 days, the agreement would become invalid 180 days
after the notice was served.</P>
      <P>China does not need such an article to scare the Taiwanese people because it has
way too many other means of destabilizing Taiwan. For example, China can decide
to harass the large number of Taiwanese companies on its territory or even
imprison prominent China-based Taiwanese businessmen.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's  best  bet against  China's  military  threat  or saber-rattling is its
intelligence and strength. A single ECFA article will not offer any guarantee of
safety.</P>
      <P>Now that the ECFA has been signed, the public and private sectors should pool
their wisdom to develop relations with China in a way that would make it
disadvantageous to China to sever those ties with Taiwan. (Editorial abstract --

      <P>United Envirotech Ltd., a water treatment firm from Singapore, is seeking to
issue Taiwan depository receipts (TDR) to raise funds on the main board, the
Taiwan Stock Exchange (TWSE) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>United Envirotech, which has been listed on the Singapore Exchange (SGX) since
2004, has filed an application with the TSWE for the TDR sale, planning to raise
NT$384 million (US$12.06 million) by issuing 32 million TDRs, each of which
represents 1.25 United Envirotech common shares, according to the company's
prospectus.</P>
      <P>The Singapore firm is the seventh foreign company to seek approval to sell TDRs
in Taiwan so far this year, and the first foreign water treatment company to try
to raise funds on the island, the TWSE said.</P>
      <P>"We will soon hold a meeting to review the application. If everything goes
smoothly, the TDR listing is expected in the fourth quarter of this year, " said
a TWSE official in charge of the TDR sale plan.</P>
      <P>United Envirotech has become one of the top seven membrane bioreactor (MBR)
treatment technology providers in the world, offering water and wastewater
treatment and reclamation solutions largely in China's chemical, petrochemical
and industrial park sectors.</P>
      <P>In 2010, China accounted for 88.94 percent of the company's total revenue, up
from 80.03 percent in 2008, the company said.</P>
      <P>United Envirotech's major customers in China include China Petroleum &amp;
Chemical Corp. (Sinopec) , China National Offshore Oil Corp., China National
Petroleum Corp. and Chinese city governments.</P>
      <P>The company said in the prospectus that as China is a rapidly growing economy
with fast expansion in its industrial sector, demand for wastewater treatment
remains strong.</P>
      <P>It said it will continue to benefit from China's economic development.</P>
      <P>During the April 2008-March 2009 period, United Envirotech posted S$14.85
million (US$10.92 million) in net profit, compared with S$3.66 million recorded

      <P>Seven Chinese enterprises showed interest in investing in Taiwan after Taiwan
signed the economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) with China last
month, the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The ministry sent an investment promotion delegation to China last week with the
aim of gaining a first-hand understanding of Chinese firms' interest in
investing in Taiwan, according to a ministry official.</P>
      <P>The delegation held investment consultation meetings in Beijing, Tianjin and
Wuhan with the participation of more than 600 Chinese firms.</P>
      <P>Beijing Enterprises Group Co., Tianjin Lishen Battery Joint-Stock Co., Tianjin
Yiqing Group Co., Tianjin Jinjiu Group Co., Dynasty Fine Wines Group Ltd.,
Wuhan Zhongbai  Group Co.  and Wuhan-based Environmental Project Technology
(CEPT) Co. signed letters of intent to invest in Taiwan with Taiwan's Chinese
National Federation of Industries.</P>
      <P>The federation is a nonprofit organization consisting of 152 member associations
in their respective manufacturing fields.</P>
      <P>In light of the brisk sales that Tsingtao Beer enjoys in Taiwan, Beijing
Enterprises expressed great interest in visiting Taiwan to seek cooperation with
Taiwanese companies and sell its Yanjing Beer in Taiwan, the official said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, in view of the fact Taiwan and China are actively developing electric
car and green energy industries, Tianjin Lishen, a major supplier of all-
electric lithium-ion batteries, also voiced eagerness to conduct technical
exchanges and cooperation  with Taiwan's manufacturers. Taiwan, however, has not
yet allowed Chinese investment in the area.</P>
      <P>Wuhan Zhongbai, which owns more than 600 supermarkets and 100 hypermarkets in
China, also voiced interest in setting up liaison offices or branches in Taiwan,
while CEPT, which owns a number of green energy patents, said it was looking
forward to collaborating with Taiwan Power Co. and Taiwan's green energy
industry.</P>
      <P>As for Chinese authorities' stance on Chinese investment in Taiwan, the official
cited Li Yafei, vice president of China's semi-official Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Straits, who said Wednesday in Taipei that China
will take measures to "push more Chinese companies to invest in Taiwan." The
remarks show China's support for Taiwan's policy of allowing Chinese investment
in Taiwan, the official said.</P>

      <P>The number of motorcyclists killed in accidents in Taipei City accounted for
more than 50 percent of the traffic death toll in the city over the past three
years, Taipei police said Thursday.</P>
      <P>According to the Traffic Division of the Taipei City Police Department, in the
first seven months of the year, 28 people died in traffic accidents involving
motorcycles and scooters, accounting for about 56 percent of the traffic
fatalities in the city.</P>
      <P>In 2009, 45 people were killed in motorcycle accidents in Taipei, which was 55
percent of the traffic fatalities, while in 2008, the figure was 44 deaths -- or
59 percent of the total number of road fatalities, police statistics showed.</P>
      <P>In order to improve motorcycle safety, the police department said it will
strengthen enforcement of the laws against drunk driving, running red lights,
riding in non-motorcycle lanes, not yielding to pedestrians on crosswalks, and
riding without helmets.</P>
      <P>The traffic division also said it will put more effort into managing the flow of
motorcycle traffic.</P>
      <P>In the first seven months of the year, 474,716 motorcyclist traffic violations
were recorded in Taipei, which was a 27.5 percent drop year-on-year, the police
said. The decrease was the result of greater focus on serious traffic
violations, the police said.</P>

    <DATELINE>08/12/10  14:48:09</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Killing to survive is common throughout human history, and also the law of the
jungle -- a law that even trees follow.</P>
      <P>In Minfong Village of Beinan Township, Taitung County, a bishopwood towers 25
meters above the ground with a trunk that measures 26.5 meters in circumference.</P>
      <P>It is estimated to be 300-400 years old, and the county government has
designated it a protected tree. Standing under its huge canopy, which covers an
area of more than 40 square meters, is an awesome and humbling experience.</P>
      <P>The bishopwood was probably there when the Dutch landed on the island in the
17th century, but in the memory of local elders, it is best known as the last of
three such trees that remain from the complex of a military field hospital in
Minfong when Taiwan was ruled by Japan from 1895 until the end of World War II.</P>
      <P>When Taiwan came under heavy bombardment from U.S. aircraft during the twilight
days of the war, local people would climb onto the tree to watch for air raids.</P>
      <P>They named the tree "General Bishopwood" in reverence, considering it a guardian
of the village and setting up a shrine dedicated to Tudigong, the earth god,
under its shadow.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, a banyan tree seed germinated on a branch of the red cedar and
began to grow on it three decades ago.</P>
      <P>The banyan tree -- also known as a red fruit fig -- sent out aerial roots from
the branch, some of which burrowed into the ground and expanded to furnish the
banyan with nutrients.</P>
      <P>At the same time, the banyan's tentacle-like roots grew into a web that covered
the huge trunk of the bishopwood.</P>
      <P>Wang Chih-chiang, a botanist and assistant professor at National Penghu
University, said it is typical for banyan trees to strangle their hosts to
survive.</P>
      <P>The banyan attracts birds, squirrels and bats with its juicy fruit, dispersing
its seeds through the animals' feces, Wang said.</P>
      <P>When one of the seeds lands on the moist limb of another tree, it sends out
aerial roots that wrap around the branches and trunk of the host tree like a boa
constrictor.</P>
      <P>The network of roots, resembling a tangle of writhing snakes, also fuse
together, forming a massive wooden straightjacket around the host.</P>
      <P>Once its aerial roots reach the ground, the banyan grows rapidly and strangles
its host by prohibiting the growth of its cambial and phloem layers, which help
provide the tree with water and nutrients, while also shading the host from the
sun, preventing it from carrying out photosynthesis.</P>
      <P>When the host tree eventually dies and decays, it leaves a hollow cavity in the
center of the banyan -- the only relic of the victim.</P>
      <P>Wang said the banyan attacks all kinds of trees including itself.</P>
      <P>In Chulu Ranch in Taitung, a date palm was entirely engulfed by a banyan, but
because of the palm's lack of outer cambial and phloem layers, it survives the
death grip of the banyan -- that is, until it is gradually shaded out -- and
looks as if it is growing out from the trunk of the banyan.</P>
      <P>Wang said the phenomenon -- a characteristic of strangler figs such as banyan
trees as well as a few types of vines-- goes on around the globe every day, at
every moment, especially in tropical rainforests.</P>
      <P>Facing the aggressive banyan, General Bishopwood's fate would appear to be
sealed, but the Taitung County government decided three years ago to step in.</P>
      <P>The county asked Lo Shen-chien -- then a researcher at the Taitung District
Agricultural Research and Extension Station -- to save the bishopwood.</P>
      <P>It was a difficult mission, if not impossible, as the banyan already covered
half of the bishopwood's trunk at the time.</P>
      <P>Lo worked out a three-pronged plan to free the bishopwood from the grip of its
attacker. Workers would cut off the canopy of the banyan to curtail its growth,
saw off its serpentine roots to stop its supply of nutrients from the earth, and
apply herbicide regularly to the roots, causing them wither gradually.</P>
      <P>But Lo, who retired from the agricultural station in July, said that he had
trouble finding anyone who would dare to cut off the banyan's branches or saw
off its aerial roots.</P>
      <P>The villagers considered the bishopwood a deity and it was rumored that many
years ago two loggers who cut down the other two bishopwood trees to make way
for a railway died mysteriously afterward.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the county's NT$20,000 budget for the project was barely enough to
buy herbicide for two treatments -- not sufficient to kill the roots.</P>
      <P>The project ended after the paltry budget ran out, and the general was left to
fight his war alone. But as a soldier, the tree refuses to yield to its destiny.</P>
      <P>It stretches its limbs out toward the sky to try to receive more sunshine and
rain, and it is obviously determined to struggle with its enemy until the bitter
end.</P>
      <P>The general will undoubtedly perish one day, but he will be remembered as a
warrior who fought a good fight and demonstrated that the essential thing in
life is not the triumph, but the struggle.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, visitors to Minfong Village shouldn't forget to stop by and pay
the general homage. By Maubo Chang CNA staff writer CNA photo 24, 25, 26, 27</P>

      <P>Taiwan share prices closed down 0.82 percent Thursday after a plunge on Wall
Street overnight amid concerns over the global economy.</P>
      <P>However, the downside was limited as bargain hunting emerged, recouping some of
the earlier losses, dealers said.</P>
      <P>The weighted index fell 65.24 points to 7,829.79, after moving between 7,776.66
and 7,837.38 on turnover of NT$115.54 billion (US$3.63 billion).</P>
      <P>The market opened down 1.34 percent on a knee jerk reaction to a 2.5 percent
dive of the Dow Jones Industrial Average overnight, with selling focusing on the
high tech sector based on lingering fears of slower demand, dealers said.</P>
      <P>However, after the index fell below the technical support level of 7,800 points,
some buying emerged to take advantage of the low valuation of the broader market
after recent losses, they said.</P>
      <P>A total of 2,119 stocks closed down and 1,471 up, while 270 remained unchanged.</P>
      <P>The machinery and electronics sector suffered the heaviest loss, dropping 1.1
percent. Plastics and chemical shares fell 0.9 percent, foodstuff 0.7 percent,
cement stocks 0.4 percent and textile shares 0.2 percent.</P>
      <P>The financial sector closed down 0.1 percent, while the paper and pulp sector
rose 0.3 percent and the construction sector gained 0.4 percent.</P>
      <P>"After the excitement over better-than-expected U.S. corporate results faded,
worry over economic fundamentals returned to haunt Wall Street again," President
Securities analyst Vickie Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>"Wall Street's weakness rippled through regional markets today and Taiwan was no
exception," Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said the bellwether electronics sector extended losses from the previous
session after investors took cues from a steep decline in the high-tech rich
Nasdaq. Notebook computer firms encountered the most pressure on concerns over
their earnings, she added.</P>
      <P>"Unless the high tech sector regains momentum, it is unlikely that the broader
market will make any significant comeback, " Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>However, Hsieh said, the local bourse seemed to have had some technical support
after it fell below 7,800 points during the trading session.</P>
      <P>"I suggest investors pay attention to select stocks, such as integrated circuit
designers, as they have become very very cheap compared to their fundamentals,"
she said.</P>
      <P>Among IC designers, MediaTek rose 0.88 percent to NT$459.00 and Novatek gained
0.88 percent to reach NT$172.00.</P>
      <P>In the notebook computer sector, AsusTek fell 1.31 percent to NT$226.00 and
Compal dropped 1.79 percent to NT$35.70.</P>
      <P>Transportation  stocks also encountered heavy profit taking pressure, with
Evergreen Marine falling 4.72 percent to NT$24.20 and EVA Airways 1.72 percent
to NT$22.80.</P>

      <P>The government will continue to take a pragmatic approach toward Taiwan's
participation in specialized agencies of the United Nations this year, Minister
of Foreign Affairs Timothy Yang said Thursday.</P>
      <P>As with last year, Taiwan will not make any formal U.N. bids during the annual
session of the U.N. General Assembly slated to open Sept. 14 in New York, Yang
told the Central News Agency.</P>
      <P>The minister, however,  said this does not mean that the government has given up
on its effort to participate in the U.N., but rather indicates a change in
strategy in accordance with changes in cross-Taiwan Strait and international
situations.</P>
      <P>Since 1993, Taiwan has been trying -- unsuccessfully, due to Beijing's
objections -- to have the U.N. discuss the issue of its representation. In 2008,
the country shifted its strategy to promoting a bid to "participate meaningfully
in the activities of specialized U.N. agencies, " in line with President Ma
Ying-jeou's policy of flexible diplomacy.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has since 2009 promoted a campaign to take part in the United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change and the International Civil Aviation
Organization. Yang said that over the past year, Taiwan's bids to join the
groups have won the support of many countries.</P>
      <P>For example, he said, the U.S. House of Representatives adopted a resolution
July 29 calling for observer status for Taiwan in the aviation group. This
followed a similar move by the European Parliament in March.</P>

      <P>As Chinese Valentine's Day approaches, the wholesale price of roses has climbed
to NT$250-500 (US$7.84-US$15.68) per 20-flower bunch, up to 20 percent higher
than at non-holiday times, an official of the Taipei Flowers Auction Co. said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Chinese Valentine's Day falls on the seventh day of the seventh month on the
lunar calendar, or Aug. 16 this year.</P>
      <P>Chen King-wong, a section manager at the flower company, said market demand
usually peaked one week before the holiday, predicting that this year the price
for a three-flower arrangement would be NT$300-NT$500, and 11-flower
arrangements NT$1,000-NT$1,500.</P>
      <P>"The market demand (for northern Taiwan) was 50,000 20-flower bunches this year,
roughly equal to the number in 2009, which led to a similar figure to last
year's pre-holiday price," Chen said.</P>
      <P>He added that with a drop in production due to hot weather, wholesalers had to
buy more than the usual amount of flowers grown at higher altitudes.</P>

      <P>A Chinese financial expert said Thursday that the financial authorities on each
side of the Taiwan Strait should consider signing an agreement to manage
bilateral currency swaps.</P>
      <P>Xia Bin, director of the Financial Research Institute under China's State
Council Development Research Center, said at a seminar in Taipei that the two
sides should study the possibility of using Chinese yuan in bilateral trade
settlements.</P>
      <P>If Chinese companies pay Chinese yuan for products purchased from Taiwanese
businessmen operating in China, that currency should be able to be deposited in
Taiwanese financial institutions or used for local investment, said Xia, a
former official of China's central bank.</P>
      <P>Offshore Chinese yuan business could offer great opportunities for Taiwanese
bankers, so the central banks on both sides should consider signing a currency
swap management agreement, Xia said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) Vice Chairwoman Lee Jih-chu said
Taiwan's central bank has a plan for Chinese yuan settlements and offshore
business, and will respect the central bank's decision.</P>
      <P>Xia also pointed out that the current cross-strait financial cooperation is just
a start and that China still needs to understand more about the needs of
Taiwan's financial development, while Taiwan needs  to  realize  the
characteristics  of China's  economic transformation.</P>
      <P>It would be difficult for China to satisfy all the needs of Taiwan's finance
industry because it would mean that China would also need to open its financial
market to the rest of the world, Xia said.</P>
      <P>He also said that the recent signing of the cross-strait economic cooperation
framework agreement will not only help lower the cost of supply chains in
industries but will also enhance the competitiveness of the greater China
region.</P>

      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih ordered the Council of Agriculture (COA) Thursday to step up
its reforestation efforts to attain a goal of creating 60,000 hectares of new
forest in the next eight years.</P>
      <P>During a weekly Cabinet meeting, Wu said that an additional 2.5 hectares of
landslide area appeared in Taiwan following Typhoon Morakot  in August  last
year,  highlighting  the urgency  of reforestation.</P>
      <P>He asked the council to make sure its efforts are in compliance with the
guidelines  set out by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change. The council should also study what kinds of trees are most suitable to
grow in Taiwan and best for soil conservation.</P>
      <P>According to a COA report, between 2008 and 2009 the council created forests
totaling 14,967 hectares, which is equal to 599 times the area of Taipei's Daan
Forest Park.</P>
      <P>To increase the incentive for the public to participate in the efforts, the COA
will raise the reward for reforestation of slope land from NT$600,000 per
hectare to NT$950,000, the council said.</P>
      <P>The COA also said it hopes to create 7,000 hectares of forests on hillside land

    <TEXT>
      <P>A ranking economics official said Thursday that Taiwan is expected to reach a
goal of more than 6 percent economic growth for 2010 on the back of robust
exports and increasing private investment and consumption.</P>
      <P>Huang Ji-shih, director of the Department of Statistics under the Ministry of
Economic Affairs, said the driving force behind Taiwan's strong export
performance has come mainly from Asia, in particular the fast-growing economies
of China and members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).</P>
      <P>"People here in Taiwan have no reason to be pessimistic about the domestic
economy, though there are some worries over U.S. economic fundamentals," Huang
said. "Taiwan will no doubt be able to reach its 2010 economic growth target."</P>
      <P>Huang said that despite recent cautious remarks by the U.S. Federal Reserve
Board on the United States economy's second half this year, it is unlikely the
U.S. will suffer a recession like the one it encountered during the financial
meltdown in 2008.</P>
      <P>In May, the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS)
raised Taiwan's 2010 economic growth forecast to 6.14 percent from an earlier
estimate of 4.72 percent.</P>
      <P>Although debt problems in the eurozone affected the global economy to some
extent, Taiwan's exports remained strong, Huang said, adding that exports in May
hit a monthly record high and shipments in June appeared robust.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan's  exports in the second quarter were better than expected, " Huang
said. "Demand in the second half of this year is expected to be boosted by the
prolonged holiday for China's National Day in October and the upcoming Christmas
buying spree. The strength of exports will be maintained."</P>
      <P>Huang said Taiwan's imports of capital equipment in July exceeded US$3 billion
for the fifth month in a row, indicating private firms have been gearing up to
expand production capacity to meet demand.</P>
      <P>He singled out Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC), the world's
largest contract chipmaker, as an example.</P>
      <P>"TSMC has raised its 2010 capacity expenditure to US$5.9 billion (from US$4.8
billion)  and about US$3 billion of the planned investments will be spent in
Taiwan in the second half of this year. It's very encouraging," Huang said.</P>
      <P>In addition, Huang said car sales -- an important gauge of private consumption
-- have showed signs of a recovery.</P>
      <P>The DGBAS has predicted private investment in 2010 will rise 18.38 percent from
a year earlier and private consumption will grow 1.99 percent.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Experts suggest getting more calcium from milk</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Milk, dark green leafy vegetables and sesame seeds are among the best sources of
calcium -- an element that helps increase height in children and prevent
osteoporosis in women, nutritionists said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Hsu Hui-yu, director of the John Tung Foundation's Food and Nutrition Division,
said that because many producers no longer use gypsum powder as an ingredient in
bean curd products, the amount of calcium in about 80 percent of soybean
products is quite low.</P>
      <P>Because of religious leanings, lactose intolerance and high milk prices in
summer, many people in Taiwan do not eat milk and dairy products but consume
soybean products instead, based on the belief that soybean products can be used
as calcium supplements.</P>
      <P>Information circulated on the Internet also claims that consuming more soybean
products is good for post-menopausal women and helps prevent osteoporosis, which
is completely untrue unless the products contain gypsum powder, a source of
calcium.</P>
      <P>Some so-called "health-related" books make the claim that milk is food for
calves, not humans, Hsu went on.</P>
      <P>Although soybeans provide a wide range of health benefits, including excellent
protein, isoflavone composition and phytosterols, a study conducted by the
foundation shows that the volume in a 240 c.c. glass of dairy milk is equal to
that of 10 glasses of soy milk, or seven boxes of soft tofu.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Pan Wen-harn, the leader of a nutrition research team at the National
Health Research Institute, said that since many schools,  organizations  and
groups began observing Mondays as vegetarian days last year, a wide range of
soybean-derived vegetarian foods have been used to replace meat and other
dishes.</P>
      <P>This has led to over-consumption of salt, seasonings and food additives among
those who follow the program, which actually poses a threat to their health,
according to Pan.</P>
      <P>Because osteoporosis is common among elderly people and is particularly
prevalent among women aged over 50, while inadequate dietary calcium intake in
children could negatively influence their growth, the two groups especially need
to drink more milk, Pan said.</P>
      <P>In addition to encouraging people to consume more milk, Hsu said that those who
do not drink milk should eat more tofu containing gypsum, dark green leafy
vegetables, sesame seeds, and should exercise more.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Education (MOE) announced on Thursday the launch of a database
management  system for international students studying in Taiwan colleges and
universities.</P>
      <P>The system, developed by Shih Hsin University using cloud computing technology,

      <P>Under the current situation, universities undergo time-consuming procedures to
document and update international student information, said Liu Ching-jen, head

      <P>The new system makes it easier to update information for both school staff and
the National Immigration Agency, which will be notified of any change in student
records, Liu said.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan universities recruit more foreign students each year, Liu said there
is a need for a unified database system among universities to facilitate
information retrieval.</P>
      <P>The system will include students from China once they are allowed to enroll in
local universities, the ministry said.</P>

      <P>Malaysia will stop issuing landing visas across the board from Aug. 15 in an
effort to prevent foreign migrant workers from abusing the program,  a
diplomatic official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>However, Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) has no plans at the moment
to respond by canceling its visa-free privileges for Malaysian visitors, said
Ger Bau-shuan, deputy director-general of MOFA's Department of East Asian and
Pacific Affairs.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has been granting visa-free  treatment to Malaysian passport holders
since 2002, while Malaysia has been offering landing visa privileges to Taiwan
citizens since 2009.</P>
      <P>According to Ger, Malaysia's decision to stop issuing landing visas is part of
its efforts to grapple with the increasingly serious problem of overstaying
visitors from China, India and Bangladesh who have been abusing the system by
working illegally in the country.</P>
      <P>Ger said Malaysia's decision applies to all countries around the world -- not
just to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He further said the Taiwan government has asked Malaysia not to mistakenly put
Taiwan on the list of countries whose citizens have been abusing the landing
visa program.</P>
      <P>Ger said the MOFA will continue to hold talks with Malaysia to push for visa-
free privileges for Taiwanese tourists.</P>
      <P>As a matter of fact, Ger said, few Malaysia-bound Taiwanese visitors opt for
landing visas because it is cheaper to obtain a Malaysian visa in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese citizens make more than 200,000 visits to Malaysia annually, Ger said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>An airport pickup service says it will have the jump on its competitors once
China lifts a restriction on individual tourism travel to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Mocca Power pickup service was founded by Hsu Lung-hsiang after he left his bank
job in 2008. Counting on his experience as a part-time taxi driver during his
college years, he went into the transportation business with limited capital.</P>
      <P>At first Hsu provided strictly an airport pickup service but when he noticed
that some Hong Kong tourists were arriving in Taiwan on holiday packages that
included only plane tickets and hotel accommodation, he extended his service to
guided tours.</P>
      <P>Mocca Power's drivers speak English, Japanese and Cantonese, and they serve as
guides on the company's sightseeing tours that cost around NT$5,000 (US$156.25)
per day.</P>
      <P>The company also provides a service for tourists who have planned their own
sightseeing tours.</P>
      <P>Hong Kong visitors have become quite taken with the service because of its
flexibility and the fact that there is no extra charge for late night airport
pickup.</P>
      <P>"Hong Kong customers tend to be distrustful, but once you offer a satisfactory
service and win their trust, word spreads," Hsu said.</P>
      <P>The company now provides more than 600 customized tours per month to travelers
from Hong Kong and Macau, which accounts for a third of its business.</P>
      <P>Hsu is expanding his fleet of vehicles as he expects the company's revenue to
double if China starts allowing visits to Taiwan by individual tourists.</P>
      <P>"Individual  Chinese  tourists  will  bring  huge  business opportunities," he
said.</P>
      <P>At present, tourists from China are only allowed to visit Taiwan as part of a
tour group.</P>
      <P>Mocca Power has participated in several travel fairs in China and continues to
work closely with airlines and travel agencies in Taiwan, Hsu said.</P>

      <P>Agriculture is the country's "root" and should not be overlooked, despite the
insignificant value of its output compared with that of other economic sectors,
President Ma Ying-jeou said Thursday.</P>
      <P>In a meeting at the Presidential Office with several agricultural experts, the
president reiterated his administration's full support for the development of
the country's agriculture.</P>
      <P>Although agricultural output accounts for only 1.7 percent of the country's
gross domestic product, "it is a vital part of the nation's security because it
ensure sufficient supplies of food and is an essential part of the ecosystem.
Its importance cannot be measured simply by its value," the president said.</P>
      <P>"Rather than being a sunset industry, agriculture is a rising industry thanks to
new technology that has given it not only a new lease on life but also a vital
role in the country," Ma said.</P>
      <P>Ma said his administration is funnelling NT$20 billion (US$625.97 million) into
the development of quality agriculture to produce fresh, healthy, safe and
convenient produce.</P>
      <P>Also, the president said, his administration is pushing for a program under
which elderly farmers would be allowed to rent their land to companies or
private groups to grow crops for commercial purposes.</P>
      <P>Describing it as a "silent land reform," Ma said the program will revitalize
agriculture by attracting younger people.</P>
      <P>He also touted the Farming Village Revitalization Act that passed the
Legislative Yuan July 14 as a feather in his administration's cap, saying that
the act will use NT$150 billion (US$4.67 billion) over 10 years to improve the
living conditions of 4,000 farming and fishing villages.</P>
      <P>He said the act is meant to improve the welfare of farmers rather than to profit
business groups.</P>
      <P>Ma also said the agriculture sector will benefit from the country's just-
concluded trade pact with China, which will promote Taiwan's agricultural
exports to China.</P>
      <P>He urged the public to take advantage of the opportunities brought about by the
"golden decade" his administration has promised to create, saying that "the
country's prospects are brighter, and I hope you will share my view."</P>

3-6, 7-6 (7-3) 7-6 (7-5) Wednesday to reach the final 16 in the men's singles of

      <P>Lu, ranked as the world's 44th, was apparently not playing at his competition
level and yielded to Mathieu in the first set following a crucial double- fault
in the fourth game.</P>
      <P>Mathieu, who ranks 95th, originally failed in the qualifying round but was lucky
enough to be picked as a replacement for Andy Roddick of the United States, who
dropped out of the event due to illness.</P>
      <P>Lu saw his service game broken by the Frenchman in the fifth game of the second
set, but later rallied to even the score by breaking Mathieu's service game in
the eighth, and then chalked up his win in the tie-breaker (7-3).</P>
      <P>In the decisive third set, Lu missed his break point chance twice in the sixth
and eighth games, but managed to outperform Mathieu after trailing 4-5 in the
tie-breaker.</P>
      <P>Lu had 12 aces, three fewer than Mathieu, but had better scores in terms of
first service success, double faults, and winners, which were factors behind his
victory.</P>
      <P>Lu will take on No. 37 Philipp Kohl Schreiber of Germany, who defeated Victor

      <P>Nantou County Magistrate Lee Chao-ching signed up Thursday to sponsor a walking
event on New Year's Day as part of the Republic of China's 100th anniversary
celebrations next year.</P>
      <P>Lee signed a banner of the Hope Cultural and Educational Foundation that is
promoting the New Year's Day walking event as part of the centenary
celebrations.</P>
      <P>President of the foundation Chi Cheng, who led a group of staff members on a
visit to the central Taiwan county to promote the group's causes, said she
appreciates Lee's support for the walking activity.</P>
      <P>So far 19 of the country's 25 cities and counties have pledged to sponsor
walking events in their districts on New Year's Day to mark the country's
centenary, said Chi, a bronze medalist in the women's 80-meter hurdles at the
1968 Olympics.</P>
      <P>In addition, Chi said, she hopes each city and county will publish an
illustrated book of its most interesting walking and hiking routes, by 2012.</P>
      <P>However, in order for walking activities to develop in Taiwan, drivers will have
to become more willing to yield to pedestrians, she said. If this could be
achieved by 2013, she said, the reports in the international media decrying the
rudeness of Taiwanese drivers toward pedestrians will stop.</P>

      <P>China Merchants Bank President and CEO Ma Weihua said Thursday that Taiwanese
banks, while facing fierce competition in Taiwan, could have much room for
development in China.</P>
      <P>Ma said at a seminar in Taipei that banks on each side of the Taiwan Strait
should enhance their cooperation and that Chinese banks should learn from their
Taiwanese counterparts  about consumer banking, agricultural banking and
derivative trading.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's banking industry faces fierce competition as there are so many banks on
the street, Ma said, adding that "each bank's return on equity (ROE) is not
high."</P>
      <P>As Taiwanese banks have limited room for further development here, they need the
greater market in China to expand their businesses,  said Ma,  who has been the
president of China's sixth-largest bank since 1999.</P>
      <P>Ma said he is impressed by Taiwan's financial talent, as the country's financial
markets are at least 20 years ahead of China's, adding that Taiwanese financial
talent can help China's banking industry develop on the right track.</P>
      <P>"There is an abundance of talent in Taiwan's financial industry, so exporting
some talent to China will not affect Taiwan much, " said Ma, who was selected by
Business Week magazine in 2009 as one of China's 40 most powerful people.</P>
      <P>With some Taiwanese banks expressing concern over being left behind by other
foreign banks in China, Ma said there are still many opportunities for Taiwanese
banks and that Taiwanese banks will surely catch up from behind.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese banks are more market-oriented and can also adapt better to Chinese
culture compared to foreign banks, Ma said.</P>
      <P>He also pointed out that Taiwanese banks not only have an existing client base
-- Taiwanese businesses operating in China -- but also have some cooperative
partners in the banking industry, giving them many opportunities.</P>
      <P>As there are more than 100,000 Taiwanese businesses operating in China,  Ma also
said the two sides should enhance  financial cooperation and set up a currency
settlement mechanism, expanding the exchangeability of the New Taiwan dollar in
China.</P>

      <P>Taiwanese singing sensation Lin Yu-chun sang "I Will Always Love You" on the
"America's Got Talent" TV show Wednesday, winning a standing ovation from the
audience and judges, who said he sounded better than the original singer,
Whitney Houston.</P>
      <P>Nick Cannon, host of the show, described Lin's live performance as astonishing
and added that he could be the first contestant on a possible production of
"World's Got Talent."</P>
      <P>Howie Mandel, one of the judges, said that a lot of people have criticized
Whitney's singing, but he found her voice as beautiful as before. She just
looked "different," he added, tongue in cheek.</P>
      <P>Sharon Osbourne, another of the judges, said Lin put lots of emotion into his
singing, so much so that it moved the audience to tears.</P>
      <P>Backstage, the show's producer congratulated Lin in attracting more hits on
Youtube compared to the total number of hits for all the contestants in all five
seasons of the show.</P>
      <P>Lin for his part said he was more nervous about singing in English in front of
foreigners, comparing the situation to a foreigner singing Taiwanese songs in
Taiwan.</P>

      <P>SinoPac Securities said Thursday it has signed an agreement with ICBC
International Holdings Ltd., which is 100 percent owned by the Industrial and
Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) ,  to set up a strategic alliance for future
business cooperation.</P>
      <P>SinoPac became the first Taiwanese securities company to team up with a Chinese
financial institution to boost its international business.</P>
      <P>ICBC International, which is based in Hong Kong, is ICBC's only investment
banking arm outside China and has more than 20,000 customers.</P>
      <P>SinoPac Chairman Chuang Ming-fu said cooperation between his company and ICBC
International will start with investment banking business.</P>
      <P>Under the alliance agreement, the two partners will cooperate with each other in
businesses ranging from mergers and acquisitions, underwriting for stock
listings, corporate fundraising and financial consulting to business information
exchanges.</P>
      <P>Chuang did not rule out the possibility that mutual cooperation will go beyond
the investment banking business, but said the two sides have no plans for the
moment to buy into each other as shareholders.</P>
      <P>ICBC International said that since Taiwan and China signed an economic
cooperation framework agreement in late June, cross-Taiwan Strait economic
activity has been increasing, providing the two partners with good business
opportunities.</P>
      <P>The two sides are first expected to work together to provide consulting services
to Yangzijiang Shipbuilding (Holdings), a private Chinese shipbuilder that is

      <P>The Tainan District Agricultural Research and Extension  Station in Tainan
County's Sinhua Township has developed a new technology to encourage
phalaenopsises, or butterfly orchids, to produce inflorescences, or flower
spikes.</P>
      <P>Dennis Wang, chief of the station, told a news conference in Taipei Thursday
that the technology, developed over four years, could shorten the period taken
for the delicate orchid to spike to between 15 and 42 days.</P>
      <P>Usually, butterfly orchids have to be kept in cold greenhouses or on high
mountains before it will blossom.</P>
      <P>One common practice now is to sell potted orchids to foreign buyers who then
keep them in greenhouses to wait for them to spike, which takes between 30 and
45 days.</P>
      <P>However, orchids without flower buds are usually priced lowered than those that
have spikes.</P>
      <P>The technology developed by the Tainan station keeps the orchids in ventilated
dark houses, which cut down the days needed for spiking and synchronizes the
size of the spikes they produce, Wang said.</P>
      <P>"The new technology speeds up the spiking process and spares the trouble of
keeping greenhouse temperatures down, while increasing sale prices by NT$15
(US$0.46) per pot," Wang said.</P>
      <P>Wang said the station is ready to transfer the new technology to commercial
orchid farmers.</P>
      <P>Taiwan exported US$52 million-worth of butterfly orchids in 2008, with potted
orchids accounting for 71 percent. The United States and Japan are the major
markets, absorbing 46.9 percent and 30.1 percent of the exports, respectively.</P>

      <P>A children's choir from Uganda will give eight performances in six cities around
Taiwan this month to raise funds for disadvantaged children in developing
countries, World Vision Taiwan said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The Watoto choir, which arrived in Taiwan Wednesday, will hold concerts in
Kaohsiung, Chiayi, Taichung, Hsinchu, Taipei and Hualien, from Aug. 15-30.</P>
      <P>"We hope to raise people's awareness of and generate support for orphaned
children around the world," World Vision said.</P>
      <P>The choir, which was formed in 1994, is composed of children aged 7-15 who have
lost their parents in civil conflicts or to AIDS. The choir members are from
Watoto Children's Village in Uganda, which was founded in 1992 by Canadian
missionaries Gary and Marilyn Skinner to care for such children.</P>
      <P>Among them is Ronald, 10, who dropped out of school after he lost his parents to

Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He urged the public to not only donate money to the cause, but also "come listen

    <TEXT>
      <P>Choreographer Yu Neng-sheng is leading the Chamber Ballet Taipei in a
presentation of his 2010 production "The Door" in Tainan, Taipei and Hsinchu
from Aug. 7-17 and has invited soloists from Germany and Austria to perform.</P>
      <P>"Like the 2007 production 'When Ballet Meets Tchaikovsky' and the 2008
production 'La Dame aux Camelias', 'The Door'is a combination of ballet and live
symphony orchestra music," Yu said, adding that he is trying to introduce the
unique characteristics of European ballet to audiences in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Yu's two-act ballet is performed to the music of La Strada by the late Italian
composer Nino Rota and the Symphonic Dances by the late Russian master Serge
Rachmaninoff. Anthony Hermus, musical director of the Opera in Dessau, Germany,
is leading the Taipei Symphony Orchestra in its presentation of the two pieces.</P>
      <P>"Live music by a symphony orchestra is an important part of my productions, " Yu
said.</P>
      <P>He said that he sometimes finds inspiration from music pieces, but most of the
time the music comes along during the choreography process.</P>
      <P>Yu said the choice of Rota's "La Strada" in the first act of "The Door" is all
about imagery. The first act is composed of a series of episodes depicting
various life experiences associated with doors -- the narrow door to the job
market, redemption behind closed doors, the revolving door for politicians,
doors leading to success and the door to eternity, to name a few, he said.</P>
      <P>While the first part of the ballet shows vivid acts of life, the second act
takes on a more abstract form to signify how "The Door" can become a turning
point in life, he said.</P>
      <P>Since he assumed the role of artistic director of the Chamber Ballet Taipei in
2007, Yu has been returning to Taiwan every summer from Austria, where he works
as deputy director of the Ballett der Grazer Oper coaching young dancers and
presenting new productions.</P>
      <P>Yu said he felt obliged to help create a good platform for young talent in
Taiwan. He praised the young dancers in "The Door" as well trained and capable
of interpreting his work.</P>
      <P>"I have invited soloists from prestigious ballet companies such as Staatbalett
in Berlin and das Ballett der Wiener Staatoper to join the performances, and
through these exchanges, Taiwanese dancers can learn the work ethics of
professional dancers," Yu said.</P>
      <P>The choreographer has lived and worked in Europe for over 20 years and is one of
the most renowned Taiwanese  artists in German-speaking countries.</P>
      <P>Despite his busy schedule in Germany and Austria, he has managed to bring
European guest artists with him to Taiwan almost every year over the past
decade. His ballet production "Verlorene Illusionen" was highly acclaimed in
Taiwan in 1994.</P>
      <P>"I hope that through the exchanges between European and Taiwanese artists, the
young dancers can be inspired, and that the performances will impress Taiwanese
audiences,  thus cultivating  a larger theater-going population here," Yu said.</P>

      <P>The Tri-Service General Hospital announced Thursday the first domestic
application of the da Vinci robotic surgical system to gastric cancer.</P>
      <P>The system, commonly used for prostatectomies and cardiac valve repair, consists
of interactive robotic arms that are controlled by surgeons from a console.</P>
      <P>During the surgery, only four small incisions (1 cm to 2 cm) are made into the
stomach so that the medical instruments can be introduced, said Chan Te-chuan,
chair of the hospital's Department of General Surgery.</P>
      <P>Chan described the traditional surgical procedure as "operating with chopsticks"
because surgeons are restricted to back and forth movements only.</P>
      <P>However, the robotic arms can move freely inside the body without restriction,
helping surgeons to excise cancerous tissue and lymph nodes, said Chan.</P>
      <P>Two gastric cancer patients who have undergone the da Vinci surgery have
recovered well, according to the hospital.</P>
      <P>Chan said the method is a good option for cancer patients who do not mind paying
a higher surgical fee.</P>

      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih said Thursday that although the number of child abuse and
filicide cases is on the decline, the government should continue to help high-
risk families to fulfill their parenting functions.</P>
      <P>Wu issued the directive after listening to a briefing on the Ministry of the
Interior's (MOI's) high-risk family counseling and aid program that was launched
in 2005 to help children from families in which child abuse, domestic violence
or filicide is most likely to occur.</P>
      <P>As of the end of June 2010, 119,743 children and adolescents had received
counseling services under the program and another 23,947 children and teenagers
had received emergency financial aid during the same period, with a total amount
of NT$1.35 billion (US$42.19 million) distributed to them, according to the MOI
report.</P>
      <P>Under the program, the report said, the MOI has pooled the resources of
education, health, labor administration, police and social welfare agencies to
establish a screening network to identify the high-risk families in order to
take precautionary measures and offer timely assistance in various fields.</P>
      <P>The premier instructed the ministry to strengthen collaboration with the police
to activate timely rescue operations for children or youngsters who fall victim
to domestic violence or other abuse by their parents, guardians or care-givers.</P>
      <P>Wu also directed the MOI to pool its professional resources to help high-risk
families cope with issues such as unemployment, education, alcoholism, drug
addiction, mental health and suicide prevention in order to ensure that the
country's younger generation can grow up in a healthy environment.</P>

      <P>Under the framework of the Republic of China Constitution, the government will
firmly stick to the "1992 consensus" to deal with China and maintain the status
quo across the Taiwan Strait, Executive Yuan spokesman Johnny Chiang said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Speaking to reporters after a regular weekly Executive Yuan meeting, Chiang said
the consensus serves as the foundation for institutionalized cross-strait
negotiations on the principle of "no unification, no independence and no use of
force."</P>
      <P>"For Taiwan, the `92 consensus' refers to `one China, respective
interpretations' with `one China' meaning the Republic of China, " Chiang
explained.</P>
      <P>Thanks to the foundation, the Taipei-based Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) and
the Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS)
have been able to conclude 14 mutually beneficial agreements since June 2008, he
said.</P>
      <P>Visiting ARATS Vice President Li Yafei said a day earlier in Taipei that based
on the mutual trust built upon the `92 consensus and the anti-Taiwan
independence stance, Taiwan and China should cooperate to mend their differences
and forge common ground.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a cross-strait seminar on peace and the creation of wealth that
opened Wednesday in Taipei, SEF Chairman Chiang Ping-kun said that although
Taiwan and China clinched a landmark economic cooperation framework agreement
(ECFA) in late June, ensuing two-way negotiations on merchandise and service
trade, investment guarantees and a trade arbitration mechanism will be more
difficult.</P>
      <P>"Fierce bargaining will be unavoidable and both sides should put aside their
disputes based on a common viewpoint," Chiang said.</P>
      <P>As follow-up negotiations will substantially affect the interests of companies
on both sides, the government will need to consult with the business community
to explore their needs, according to Chiang.</P>

Rachmaninoff. Anthony Hermus, musical director of the Opera in Dessau, Germany,
is leading the Taipei Symphony Orchestra in its presentation of the two pieces.</P>
      <P>"Live music by a symphony orchestra is an important part of my productions, " Yu
said.</P>
      <P>He said that he sometimes finds inspiration from music pieces, but most of the
time the music comes along during the choreography process.</P>
      <P>Yu said the choice of Rota's "La Strada" in the first act of "The Door" is all
about imagery. The first act is composed of a series of episodes depicting
various life experiences associated with doors -- the narrow door to the job
market, redemption behind closed doors, the revolving door for politicians,
doors leading to success and the door to eternity, to name a few, he said.</P>
      <P>While the first part of the ballet shows vivid acts of life, the second act
takes on a more abstract form to signify how "The Door" can become a turning
point in life, he said.</P>
      <P>Since he assumed the role of artistic director of the Chamber Ballet Taipei in
2007, Yu has been returning to Taiwan every summer from Austria, where he works
as deputy director of the Ballett der Grazer Oper coaching young dancers and
presenting new productions.</P>
      <P>Yu said he felt obliged to help create a good platform for young talent in
Taiwan. He praised the young dancers in "The Door" as well trained and capable
of interpreting his work.</P>
      <P>"I have invited soloists from prestigious ballet companies such as Staatbalett
in Berlin and das Ballett der Wiener Staatoper to join the performances, and
through these exchanges, Taiwanese dancers can learn the work ethics of
professional dancers," Yu said.</P>
      <P>The choreographer has lived and worked in Europe for over 20 years and is one of
the most renowned Taiwanese  artists in German-speaking countries.</P>
      <P>Despite his busy schedule in Germany and Austria, he has managed to bring
European guest artists with him to Taiwan almost every year over the past
decade. His ballet production "Verlorene Illusionen" was highly acclaimed in
Taiwan in 1994.</P>
      <P>"I hope that through the exchanges between European and Taiwanese artists, the
young dancers can be inspired, and that the performances will impress Taiwanese
audiences,  thus cultivating  a larger theater-going population here," Yu said.</P>

      <P>The Tri-Service General Hospital announced Thursday the first domestic
application of the da Vinci robotic surgical system to gastric cancer.</P>
      <P>The system, commonly used for prostatectomies and cardiac valve repair, consists
of interactive robotic arms that are controlled by surgeons from a console.</P>
      <P>During the surgery, only four small incisions (1 cm to 2 cm) are made into the
stomach so that the medical instruments can be introduced, said Chan Te-chuan,
chair of the hospital's Department of General Surgery.</P>
      <P>Chan described the traditional surgical procedure as "operating with chopsticks"
because surgeons are restricted to back and forth movements only.</P>
      <P>However, the robotic arms can move freely inside the body without restriction,
helping surgeons to excise cancerous tissue and lymph nodes, said Chan.</P>
      <P>Two gastric cancer patients who have undergone the da Vinci surgery have
recovered well, according to the hospital.</P>
      <P>Chan said the method is a good option for cancer patients who do not mind paying
a higher surgical fee.</P>

      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih said Thursday that although the number of child abuse and
filicide cases is on the decline, the government should continue to help high-
risk families to fulfill their parenting functions.</P>
      <P>Wu issued the directive after listening to a briefing on the Ministry of the
Interior's (MOI's) high-risk family counseling and aid program that was launched
in 2005 to help children from families in which child abuse, domestic violence
or filicide is most likely to occur.</P>
      <P>As of the end of June 2010, 119,743 children and adolescents had received
counseling services under the program and another 23,947 children and teenagers
had received emergency financial aid during the same period, with a total amount
of NT$1.35 billion (US$42.19 million) distributed to them, according to the MOI
report.</P>
      <P>Under the program, the report said, the MOI has pooled the resources of
education, health, labor administration, police and social welfare agencies to
establish a screening network to identify the high-risk families in order to
take precautionary measures and offer timely assistance in various fields.</P>
      <P>The premier instructed the ministry to strengthen collaboration with the police
to activate timely rescue operations for children or youngsters who fall victim
to domestic violence or other abuse by their parents, guardians or care-givers.</P>
      <P>Wu also directed the MOI to pool its professional resources to help high-risk
families cope with issues such as unemployment, education, alcoholism, drug
addiction, mental health and suicide prevention in order to ensure that the
country's younger generation can grow up in a healthy environment.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Under the framework of the Republic of China Constitution, the government will
firmly stick to the "1992 consensus" to deal with China and maintain the status
quo across the Taiwan Strait, Executive Yuan spokesman Johnny Chiang said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Speaking to reporters after a regular weekly Executive Yuan meeting, Chiang said
the consensus serves as the foundation for institutionalized cross-strait
negotiations on the principle of "no unification, no independence and no use of
force."</P>
      <P>"For Taiwan, the `92 consensus' refers to `one China, respective
interpretations' with `one China' meaning the Republic of China, " Chiang
explained.</P>
      <P>Thanks to the foundation, the Taipei-based Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) and
the Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS)
have been able to conclude 14 mutually beneficial agreements since June 2008, he
said.</P>
      <P>Visiting ARATS Vice President Li Yafei said a day earlier in Taipei that based
on the mutual trust built upon the `92 consensus and the anti-Taiwan
independence stance, Taiwan and China should cooperate to mend their differences
and forge common ground.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a cross-strait seminar on peace and the creation of wealth that
opened Wednesday in Taipei, SEF Chairman Chiang Ping-kun said that although
Taiwan and China clinched a landmark economic cooperation framework agreement
(ECFA) in late June, ensuing two-way negotiations on merchandise and service
trade, investment guarantees and a trade arbitration mechanism will be more
difficult.</P>
      <P>"Fierce bargaining will be unavoidable and both sides should put aside their
disputes based on a common viewpoint," Chiang said.</P>
      <P>As follow-up negotiations will substantially affect the interests of companies
on both sides, the government will need to consult with the business community
to explore their needs, according to Chiang.</P>

      <P>In a seminar held in Taipei Wednesday, China's Association for Relations Across
the Taiwan Straits Vice President Li Yafei said the so-called "1992 consensus"
refers to an understanding reached between Taiwan and China in 1992 "to
separately verbalize the one China principle."</P>
      <P>The administration of President Ma Ying-jeou often says that the "1992
consensus" means "one China, separate interpretations, " which seems to differ
from China in terms of the wording. In fact, the so-called "1992 consensus" is
in substance "one China." The Ma administration has no way of skirting this, no
matter how it interprets the consensus.</P>
      <P>The Ma administration is well aware that the Taiwanese people are against the
so-called "one China" and therefore uses the "1992 consensus" as a smokescreen
to fool the people.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, it has been denying the people their right to referendum again and
again, suppressing their voices. Once the Taiwanese people lose their freedom of
speech completely, China will not allow "separate interpretations" and will make
Taiwan accept its version of the consensus.</P>

action to protect Taiwan and themselves. (Editorial abstract -- Aug. 13, 2010)</P>

visit last week, they discussed the structure and operation guidelines of the
new body to be formed under the bilateral economic cooperation framework
agreement (ECFA) signed June 29, the sources said.</P>

      <P>The Chinese side did not oppose the proposal, the sources said, adding that as
the commission  will serve as a platform for negotiations on cross-strait
economic and trade affairs, it will be manned by officials in the relevant
fields.</P>

      <P>The "one China principle" is different from "one China." It can be viewed as an
inclusive concept, while "one China" is exclusive.</P>
      <P>The point of Li's statement is that the two sides should seek common ground

    <DATELINE>08/13/10  12:33:41
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>State Public Prosecutor-General Huang Shyh-ming reaffirmed his determination
Thursday to crack down on corruption in the judiciary, saying the integrity of
judges and prosecutors is the only line of defense for justice.</P>
      <P>After a number of senior judges, prosecutors and civil servants have come under
investigation recently in a spate of graft scandals, Huang said it is his
obligation as Taiwan's top prosecutor to rid the country of corrupt officials
and judicial personnel.</P>
      <P>President  Ma Ying-jeou also threw his support behind the anti-corruption drive
after being briefed by Huang on a Ministry of Justice initiative to set up an
anti-corruption agency under its jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from the local media coverage of the issue:</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>In a new drive to streamline discipline in the judiciary, the Taiwan High Court
decided Thursday to refer two of its judges to the Control Yuan for discipline
over misconduct that has tarnished the reputation of the judiciary.</P>
      <P>One of the judges, Kao Ming-tse, is accused of having illegally acquitted the
son of a colleague at the Supreme Court in a traffic violation case, while the
other, Yang Ping-chen, is allegedly involved in a collective bribery case.</P>
      <P>Yang's residence was searched Wednesday as part of the probe into his role in
the acquittal of former high court judge Chang Bing-lung. Chang was recently
given a 12-year prison sentence for taking bribes. Prosecutors are still
investigating Yang's role in the case.</P>
      <P>The high court disciplinary panel decided to refer the two cases to the Control
Yuan -- the supreme watchdog body for government behavior -- after more than
seven hours of heated debate.</P>
      <P>The panel took the action  a day after  prosecutors  and investigators raided 20
locations in cities and counties in northern Taiwan in a new drive to wipe out
graft in the judiciary.</P>
      <P>It was the second large-scale probe into suspected corruption in the judiciary
in recent weeks and was carried out under a Special Investigation Division-led
judiciary self-correction campaign aimed at ridding the judicial system of graft
and ensuring its integrity.</P>
      <P>Three high court judges and a prosecutor have been detained since mid-July on
bribery charges involving former Miaoli Magistrate Ho Chih-hui. (Aug. 13, 2010).</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>On Thursday, top prosecutor Huang ordered a probe into the case involving Kao,
who is accused of having lobbied other judges on his panel to acquit the son of
Hsiao Yang-kuei, a Supreme Court judge, in a traffic violation case.</P>
      <P>Hsiao's son was convicted at his first trial in the Keelung District Court, but
was acquitted by a panel of three judges headed by Kao in the Taiwan High Court
at his second trial. As the High Prosecutors Office did not appeal the
acquittal, the case was then closed.</P>
      <P>Speculation has been rife that prosecutors and judges at various levels faced

      <P>Responding to a backlash from the judicial community over the recent "self-

stressed that no official or judge is too senior to be probed as long as
sufficient evidence is available.</P>

      <P>As high as 85.6 percent of the respondents to a recent government survey think
men and women should share the workload either in the workplace  or at home,
the Research, Development and Evaluation Commission (RDEC) reported Friday.</P>
      <P>On gender perception, 80 percent of the respondents said they did not agree that
"the husband is the head of the household and the wife should do her best to
obey her husband, " while 72.1 percent disagree with the idea that "unmarried
women cannot be enshrined in ancestral temples after death, " the RDEC-conducted
survey on gender equality found.</P>
      <P>The results also show that 68.4 percent of the respondents disagreed with the
notion that "every woman should give birth to at least one male child to
continue the family line, " and 60.2 percent did not agree that "men should bear
the responsibility of making money to support their families, while women's work
is handling household chores and caring for the family."</P>
      <P>Regarding a proposal that both paternal and maternal grandparents can be
referred to by the same honorific, 50.1 percent of respondents said they agree,
while 44.1 percent said they disagree with the proposal. Chinese tradition has
different honorifics for both sets of grandparents.</P>
      <P>Generally speaking, 53.5 percent of the respondents think that at present, men
hold higher social status than women in Taiwan, while 31.6 percent believe
Taiwan has achieved gender equality. Only 9 percent think women's social status
is higher than men's, according to the poll.</P>
      <P>On sexual harassment and violence, 98.2 percent of those polled said they had
not suffered physical sexual harassment over the past one year, and 91.6 percent
reported they had not suffered verbal sexual harassment during the same period.</P>
      <P>It was also found that 72 percent of the respondents were aware that they can
call 113 to seek help if they fall victim to domestic violence or sexual
assault. Meanwhile, 77.2 percent said that overall, gender equality exists in
the workplace.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted July 27-28 among 1,091 adults around Taiwan. It had a
confidence level of 95 percent and a margin of error of plus or minus 2.97
percentage points.</P>

      <P>Smartphone maker HTC Corp. was listed as the world's eighth-largest cell phone
seller in the second quarter of this year, the first time the Taiwanese company
has ranked among the top 10 mobile device companies in the world, Gartner said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>In the April-June period, HTC sold 5.91 million cell phones, up 139.1 percent
from a year earlier and representing a 1.8 percent share of the global market,
said Gartner, an information technology research and advisory company.</P>
      <P>In the second quarter of last year, HTC accounted for 0.9 percent of the total
global cell phone sales, shipping 2.47 million units worldwide.</P>
      <P>The company's growth "reflects the popularity of its Android portfolio but also
a more aggressive branding strategy compared to the same period of 2009,"
Gartner said in a statement.</P>
      <P>According to Gartner, Android became the world's third most popular smartphone
operating system after overtaking Apple's iPhone OS, and also took the top spot
in the United States.</P>
      <P>Gartner said global mobile device sales to end-users totaled 325.6 million units
in the second quarter of 2010, up 13.8 percent from a year earlier.</P>
      <P>During the same period, smartphone sales totaled 61.6 million units, up 50.5
percent year-on-year, and made up 19 percent of worldwide mobile device sales,
Gartner said.</P>
      <P>Nokia grabbed the top position in worldwide cell phone sales in the second
quarter, shipping a total of 111.47 million units to end-users, which
represented a 34.2 percent share of the global market.</P>
      <P>Samsung sold 65.33 million units, accounting for 20.1 percent, and claimed the
second position in the world, while LG's sales totaled 29.37 million units,
accounting for 9 percent of the world's total sales.</P>
      <P>Research in Motion (RIM) was the world's fourth-largest cell phone firm, selling
11.23 million units and representing 3.4 percent of the global sales, while Sony
Ericsson held the No. 5 position with sales totaling 11.01 million, accounting
for a 3.4-percent market share.</P>
      <P>Motorola took the No. 6 position and a 2.8 percent market share, selling 9.11
million units, while Apple sold 8.74 million units, grabbing the seventh-largest
position and claiming a 2.7 percent market share.</P>
      <P>"Although the mobile communication devices market showed double- digit growth
this quarter, average selling prices (ASPs) were lower than expected and margins
fell, " said Carolina Milanesi, Gartner's research vice president.</P>
      <P>Gartner said companies, such as LG and Samsung pursued market share by
penetrating a low-margin market but this move proved risky as LG's ASP in the
second quarter fell 27.8 percent from a year earlier.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A report released Wednesday by the Ministry of Finance shows that Taipei City's
revenue from land value increment tax declined by NT$110 million in July from
the previous month. The situation is believed to be the result of recent
measures taken by the central bank to cool the overheated property market in the
greater Taipei area.</P>
      <P>On the same day, however, a building located near the Taipei Railway Station was
auctioned off at a record NT$8.33 million (US$261,000) per ping (one ping equals
3.3 square meters).</P>
      <P>The phenomena  are related to the polarization  of wealth distribution and
rural-urban development. More and more high-income earners are scrambling to buy
luxury residences in prime areas to show how wealthy they are, pushing housing
prices higher and higher. This group of people has no need to borrow money from
financial institutions and therefore is not affected by the property market
cooling measures.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, those at the bottom of the wealth pyramid cannot afford to
buy homes unless they can secure a bank mortgage. Any credit control measures by
the government impacts them directly.</P>
      <P>The skyrocketing housing prices in prime areas of Taipei City can be attributed
to the scant land availability there. To resolve the problem, Taipei City and
the soon-to-be-established Xinbei City should be merged into a single new
metropolis as soon as possible. With proper planning and development, many prime
areas would be created, which would help stabilize land prices. (Editorial

      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) is scheduled to hold an investment-
solicitation meeting in Tokyo Aug. 24 with the aim of seeking the cooperation of
Japanese investors to jointly tap into the massive Chinese market, a ministry
official said Friday.</P>
      <P>The meeting, aimed at attracting Japanese investment to mainly explore China's
medical and health-care market, is expected to see the participation of 400
Taiwanese and Japanese companies, the official said.</P>
      <P>Anticipating that enormous business opportunities will be created in the wake of
the economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) Taiwan signed with China
June 29, Japan's Mizuho Corporate Bank inked a memorandum of understanding with
the MOEA in January to broker cooperation between businesses in Taiwan and Japan
seeking to invest in China and Association  of Southeast  Asian Nations (ASEAN)
countries, according to the official.</P>
      <P>He added that with the medical and health-care service sector included on the
ECFA's "early harvest" list of goods and services eligible  for preferential
market access treatment,  Taiwanese businesses will be allowed to set up
hospitals in areas with high concentrations of Taiwanese businesses, including
Shanghai City and Jiangsu, Fujian, Guangdong and Hainan provinces.</P>
      <P>This factor has spurred great interest among Japanese businesses in cooperating
with Taiwanese investors to grab a share of the potentially lucrative medical
and health-care market in China, the official added.</P>
      <P>The Japanese bank unveiled in May a list of 10 Japanese small and medium-sized
enterprises interested in cooperating with Taiwanese businesses.</P>
      <P>The participants in the Tokyo meeting are expected to include members of a
development association of medical and health-care industries across the Taiwan
Strait headed by ruling Kuomintang Legislator Liao Kuo-tung and aimed at
developing and integrating the medical markets on either side of the strait.</P>

      <P>Taiwan share prices closed up 0.78 percent Friday on a technical rebound after
the market incurred heavy losses in the past few sessions amid concerns over the
global economic climate, dealers said.</P>
      <P>The weighted index rose 61.79 points to 7,891.58 after moving between 7,830.46
and 7,906.35 on turnover of NT$131.15 billion (US$4.10 billion).</P>
      <P>The market opened up 0.21 percent as bargain hunting emerged and the momentum
accelerated, led by the bellwether electronics sector, which had been hard hit,
in particular, by worse-than-expected July sales reported by personal computer
stocks, dealers said.</P>
      <P>The buying also spread to old economy shares, as investors still embraced high
hopes that increasing economic exchanges across the Taiwan Strait will boost
their earnings, they said.</P>
      <P>A total of 2,673 stocks closed up and 1,065 were down, with 299 remaining
unchanged.</P>
      <P>The construction sector scored the highest gains, up 2.4 percent. Plastics and
chemical stocks rose 1.2 percent, paper and pulp shares added 1.0 percent,
machinery and electronics gained 0.9 percent, and textile stocks added 0.80.</P>
      <P>Foodstuffs and financial stocks gained 0.3 percent, while the cement sector fell
0.10 percent.</P>
      <P>After the index rose to breach the key 8,000-point mark Monday, investors
scrambled to take profits, pushing the market down 2.63 percent in the past
three trading days.</P>
      <P>"Despite the selling, the market has held itself well above 7,800 points, paving
the path for today's rebound, " MasterLink Securities analyst Tom Tang said.</P>
      <P>Tang said bargain hunters were eyeing small and medium-sized high-tech stocks,
while the electronics heavyweights  appeared lackluster.</P>
      <P>As fears of further volatility on Wall Street remained in place, many foreign
institutional investors tended to stay on the sidelines and to leave large-cap
high-tech stocks alone, Tang said.</P>
      <P>"Without aggressive buying from foreign investors to boost the high-tech
heavyweights, the broader market still traded in a narrow range," Tang said.</P>
      <P>"I expect consolidation  will continue to dominate  market movements. It will
not be easy for the bourse to surmount the resistance ahead of 8,000 points next
week," he said.</P>
      <P>Among the small and medium-sized stocks, touch panel maker Wintek rose 6.88
percent to NT$37.30 and optical storage media firm Gigastorage gained 6.13
percent to end at NT$45.90.</P>
      <P>However, large-cap United Microelectronics Corp. closed unchanged at NT$14.10,
while rival Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. fell 0.17 percent to finish
the day at NT$60.10.</P>
      <P>In the old economy sector, Prince Housing rose 3.13 percent to close at
NT$16.50, while Taiwan Pulp and Paper gained 4.18 percent to end trading at
NT$14.95.</P>

      <P>The recently concluded cross-Taiwan Strait trade deal is likely to bring forth a
new model for cooperation in which Japan can use Taiwan as a base to access the
Chinese market, a Cabinet official said Friday.</P>
      <P>According to Minister without Porfolio Yiin Chii-ming, who has just returned
from Japan, Japanese businesses are paying great attention to the issue
following the signing of the economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA)
between Taiwan and China, under which selected Taiwanese products will gain
zero-tariff entry to China.</P>
      <P>Yiin said that while in Japan, he read a news report that quoted Japan's new
ambassador to Beijing as saying that "if Japan does not sign a free trade
agreement with China, Japan will sink," showing the impact of the cross-strait
ECFA on foreign countries.</P>
      <P>The minister said the ECFA, combined with direct cross-strait shipping and air
links and the soon-to-be-launched air links between Taipei's  Songshan  Airport
and Tokyo's Haneda Airport,  will significantly enhance Taiwan's competitive
edge.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's rich experience with the Chinese market also makes Taiwan a perfect
partner for Japanese businesses intending to enter the Chinese market, Yiin
said.</P>
      <P>The minister was speaking at a news conference held by the ruling Kuomintang
legislative caucus to discuss the benefits of the ECFA's early-harvest program,
under which China will reduce the tariffs for 539 Taiwanese goods to zero within
two years after the agreement takes effect.</P>
      <P>According to a forecast by the Cabinet, the program will create 60,000 jobs in
Taiwan, increase output by NT$190 billion, raise the gross domestic product by
NT$54.9 billion and allow Taiwan to save NT$29.5 billion in tariffs.</P>

      <P>Former Premier Tang Fei was diagnosed with Legionnaires' disease after being
flown to Taiwan on an emergency flight from China early Thursday for treatment
of a lung infection at Veterans General Hospital in Taipei, a hospital spokesman
said Friday.</P>
      <P>After diagnosing him with Legionnaires' disease, a type of pneumonia caused by
bacteria called Legionella, doctors treated him with erythromycin, an
antibiotic, and notified the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) of his case, the
spokesman said.</P>
      <P>After conducting a chest X-ray and examination Friday morning, a doctor said
Tang showed improvement  in his pneumonia,  heart irregularities, shortness of
breath and pleural effusion -- fluid accumulated around the lungs.</P>
      <P>Other checks also showed improvements, such as a decrease in lung inflammation
indicators and an increased white blood cell count.</P>
      <P>Moreover, his vital signs, including pulse, body temperature and blood pressure,
all fell within normal ranges, the spokesman said, adding that Tang was fully

      <P>Taiwan is being prompted to consider increasing the daily quota of Chinese
people allowed to visit the country, thanks to the increasing and seemingly
unstoppable growth in the number of Chinese visitors.</P>
      <P>Asked about the current Chinese visitor quota, which restricts the entrance of
visitors from China to 3,000 people per day, Tourism Bureau Director-General
Janice Lai said Friday that the government will carefully study whether or not
to raise the quota.</P>
      <P>"There are many factors involved," Lai said, noting that pursuing the growth of
tourism should not just focus on the volume of visitors.</P>
      <P>Shao Qiwei, president of the Beijing-based Cross-Strait Tourism Association, who
is currently visiting Taipei to attend a travel fair, said earlier in the day
that the volume of visits to Taiwan by Chinese travelers is expected to surge to
1.5 million this year.</P>
      <P>The number will soon break the 3-million barrier, Shao predicted, advising the
authorities on both sides of the Taiwan Strait to outline strategies in advance
to handle the rising number of Chinese tourists.</P>
      <P>In response, Chen Mei-hsiu, chief of the Tourism Bureau's Hotel, Travel and
Training Division, said visits by Chinese reached a peak between April and June.
During this period, the daily number of visitors reached as high 7,200 at one
point, she said.</P>
      <P>This was possible because the quota sets a maximum number. If the actual number
of arrivals on any given day falls below the quota limit, the shortfall can be
carried over and added to the following day's accumulated quota, and so on.</P>
      <P>In July, the volume of Chinese visitors returned to the normal level of below
3,000 per day, Chen went on, adding that she expects another wave of Chinese
visits in October, when Chinese workers have a long vacation to celebrate Oct. 1
National Day.</P>
      <P>Chen said that any adjustment will be made depending on market demand, but added
that the bureau must still consider many factors, including the number of
hotels, tour buses and tour guides in the country.</P>
      <P>"The quota of 3,000 will be enough until the end of the year, " Chen said.</P>

      <P>Police announced Friday that they had busted a drug-smuggling ring thanks to
information exchanges between local police and their Japanese counterparts.</P>
      <P>Police said they arrested the mastermind of the ring,  a 64-year-old surnamed
Yang, along with four of his subordinates, in the departure lounge at Taiwan
Taoyuan International Airport the previous afternoon, as well as three drug
mules, including a 29-year-old disabled woman.</P>
      <P>Police also seized 559.5 grams of amphetamine the mules had hidden inside their
body cavities.</P>
      <P>Yang had previously been sentenced to 15 years in prison for heroin smuggling by
Taipei Shihlin District Court in 2007, police said. However, he fled into a
mountainous area in Shihting, Taipei County, and was put on the wanted list.</P>
      <P>Police said Yang would often find street people to serve as the ring's drug
mules, paying them between NT$50,000 (US$1,560) and NT$200,000 for each run,
depending on the volume of each shipment.</P>
      <P>They said that Yang would arrange for his subordinate, Lin, who is familiar with
the Tokyo drug market, to keep a close watch on the drug mules during their time
in Japan, and would then take them back to Taiwan after they had made their
deliveries.</P>
      <P>According to the police, between February and May, six mules working for the
ring were arrested after arriving in Japan, with the Japanese authorities
seizing 4.6 kg of amphetamine in total.</P>
      <P>The smuggling came to the attention of police after TV celebrity Juan Mu-hua
complained that he and other members of a Taiwanese tour group were detained at
a Japanese airport in early March after two members of the group were caught
smuggling drugs. The two were later found to be members of Yang's ring.</P>
      <P>Police said Taiwan-produced amphetamine, due to its high degree of purity, can
sell for NT$20,000 per gram in Japan, almost double the price sold in Taiwan.</P>

which runs from Friday to Aug. 16, presents visitors with a mix of fun and
educational activities related to the country's agriculture, the Council of
Agriculture (COA) said.</P>
      <P>With 250 booths -- almost a quarter of the total booths at the exhibition -- the
council is ambitious in promoting and marketing Taiwan's agricultural
achievements in its first appearance at the fair, COA Minister Chen Wu-hsiung

mainland China.</P>
      <P>The council estimates that within three years of signing the ECFA,  the export

    <HEADLINE>20-somethings most likely to defy ghosts in buying homes</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>People in the 20-29 age bracket are the most fearless in buying residential
property during "ghost month, " while those over 50 still harbor strong
superstitions, a local real estate company said Friday.</P>
      <P>Analyzing data on home transactions it brokered between 2006 and 2009, H&amp;B
Realty Franchise System found that the share of all homes bought by people in
the 20-29 age bracket during "ghost month" (19.2 percent) was a staggering 45
percent higher than the 13.2 percent share young adults averaged during the
previous "normal" month.</P>
      <P>In contrast, the average share of the 50-59 age bracket during "ghost month" was
11.8 percent, down from 20.4 percent in the previous month, a 42 percent plunge.</P>
      <P>"Ghost month, " the seventh month of the lunar calendar, is the time when the
Gates of Hades are opened to let ghosts and spirits into the world of the living
for a month-long party.</P>
      <P>There are many traditional taboos associated with "ghost month, " including the
belief that buying real estate during the month will invite the ghosts into the
house and bring bad luck.</P>
      <P>But with all age groups below the age of 50 showing increases in the share of
homes they buy during ghost month, the taboo seems to be followed today mainly
by older generations, said Hsu Chia-hsing, director of the H&amp;B Realty's
research division.</P>
      <P>Young home buyers in the 20-29 age bracket had a material reason for defying the
traditional taboo.</P>
      <P>"The trend shows that young home buyers actively struck deals in 'ghost month'
because they felt there was a better chance of negotiating deeper discounts,"
Hsu said.</P>
      <P>The 40-49 age group, which usually accounts for the most home purchases of any
age bracket throughout the year also had the highest share (31.4 percent) during
"ghost month, " followed by the 30-39 age group with a 27.6 percent share.</P>
      <P>The shares of both groups rose by more than 3 percentage points compared to the
month before "ghost month," Hsu said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Memory chip maker Powerchip Technology Corp. said Friday its LED materials plant
under construction in Xuzhou, China, part of a plan to diversify its business,
will begin operations in 2011.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the sideline of a technology forum in Shanghai, Powerchip Chairman
Frank Huang said the new plant will benefit from Xuzhou's geographic advantage
and convenient transportation links after it becomes operational.</P>
      <P>In March, Powerchip announced it would invest US$15 million through a third
location in the Xuzhou facility, which will produce LED EPI wafers and chips,
core LED materials.</P>
      <P>Huang said the company plans to invest a total of US$300 million in LED
production facilities in China to help cushion the impact of a down cycle in
Powerchip's core business -- dynamic random access memory (DRAM) chip
manufacturing.</P>
      <P>Powerchip is one of many Taiwanese high-tech firms, including Taiwan
Semiconductor  Manufacturing  Co.  (TSMC)  and  United Microelectronics Corp.,
that have invested in the production of energy efficiency or renewable energy
products, such as LEDs and solar cells, and are also targeting China's market.</P>
      <P>In the first half of the year, 925,000 LED TVs were sold in China, 10.6 percent
of all flat panel TVs sold there during the period. This market penetration rate
is expected to rise to 25 percent in the second half of the year, indicating the
LED sector will grow accordingly.</P>
      <P>Last month, TSMC said it would raise its 2010 capital expenditure to US$5.9
billion from the previously planned US$4.8 billion and assign about US$100
million to business diversification, which the market believes will be directed
at the LED and solar power sectors.</P>
      <P>The global DRAM sector is suffering from declining prices because of demand
weakened by the eurozone's debt problems and the slowing pace of global economic
recovery, market observers said.</P>
      <P>DRAM prices staged a significant rebound in the fourth quarter of last year
after a meltdown amid the global financial crisis in 2008, and the momentum
extended into the first quarter of this year before the European debt problems
surfaced.</P>
      <P>Several Taiwanese  DRAM makers,  such as Powerchip,  Nanya Technology Corp. and
Inotera Memories Inc., are migrating to advanced production process in an
attempt to cut costs to reduce the impact of product price falls.</P>

      <P>A Central Taiwan Science Park (CTSP) official said Friday that 25 companies in
the science park are seeking 7,857 new employees to meet higher workforce demand
for production expansion.</P>
      <P>The companies, including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) and flat
panel maker AU Optronics Corp., will team up to hold an Aug. 15 job fair and
recruitment drive, the official said.</P>
      <P>TSMC needs 3,050 new employees, mostly engineers, to man a new 12-inch wafer
plant and planned solar energy production facilities, while AU Optronics is
looking for 1,800 newcomers, also mostly engineers, he said.</P>
      <P>LED epiwafer and chip producer Lextar Corp. will offer 1,000 jobs at the job
fair, while IC testing and packaging firm Siliconware Precision Industries Co.
will provide an additional 860, the official added.</P>
      <P>"The large job fair reflects the increasing need for technology talent to meet
the needs of expansion on a recovery in the global market," the park official
said.</P>
      <P>With the global economy rebounding from a financial meltdown in 2008, the number
of employees in the CTSP has been increasing accordingly, he went on.</P>
      <P>"As of July, the number of employees had reached 21,785, the highest level since
the science park began operations in 2003. No-one in the science park is on
unpaid leave," he said.</P>
      <P>In March, the CTSP held a similar job fair, offering 2,660 jobs and attracting
about 7,000 applicants.</P>

      <P>Companies participating in the 2010 Taichung Computer Show complained of a
shortage of space at the Taichung World Trade Center at the exhibition's opening
on Friday, the organizer said.</P>
      <P>The 2010 Taichung Computer Show drew more than 100 companies that presented more
than 400 booths in a space originally designed to accommodate only 250 booths,
Taichung Computer Association Chairman Sun Teng-yuan said.</P>
      <P>"The central Taiwan area needs a large-scale exhibition center, and the
construction of such a facility should be completed as soon as possible," Sun

      <P>Manufacturers of 15 products recently inspected by the Consumers' Foundation
were found to have provided misleading information on their packaging or labels,
the foundation reported Friday.</P>
      <P>The foundation recently purchased three types of cookies, eight instant
beverages and ordinary beverage products, and four other varieties of products,
on which to conduct random checks.</P>
      <P>All the products  looked at provided  false or misleading information such as
product names, pictures of products and product descriptions, said Yu Kai-
hsiung, publisher of the foundation's Consumer Reports Magazine.</P>
      <P>For example, Hokkaido Milk Cereal is actually made in Taiwan and the product's
list of ingredients does not contain a single item from the Japanese prefecture
of Hokkaido, Yu said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the packaging of one brand of crackers shows a picture of a wide
variety of vegetables on the box, although only green onions are actually listed
on the label.</P>
      <P>The legend "Dahu strawberry" is highlighted in big letters on the packaging of a
strawberry yogurt product, despite the fact that the product does not actually
contain strawberries, while a honey tea product does not actually contain any
honey, Yu added.</P>
      <P>Yang Nai-yen, a foundation member, warned consumers to pay more attention to
what they are buying and to avoid consuming excessive amounts of drinks
containing artificial flavoring.</P>
      <P>Foundation Chairman Hsieh Tien-jen urged manufacturers of the poorly packaged
products make improvements in the packaging and labeling of their products and
to stop making misleading claims to consumers.</P>
      <P>According to the Food Sanitation Management Act, the Department of Health could
fine manufacturers up to NT$200,000 (US$6,266) for misleading consumers, Yu
said, adding that the manufacturers are also at risk of being fined NT$25
million by the Fair Trade Commission (FTC).</P>
      <P>Yu also urged the DOH and FTC to address the situation and warned that if they
fail to do so, the foundation will file a complaint with the Control Yuan
accusing the two agencies of shirking their duties.</P>

      <P>The cost of foreign exchange transactions will not be affected by HSBC's
decision to stop supplying Taiwanese banks with foreign banknotes in October,
Taiwan's central bank pledged Friday.</P>
      <P>A local newspaper reported that HSBC, which has a large share of the global
wholesale banknote trading market, will stop supplying Taiwanese banks with
foreign banknotes on Oct. 19, which could make it more expensive for the public
to buy or sell U.S. dollars, Japanese yen, Hong Kong dollars or other foreign
currencies.</P>
      <P>After HSBC's withdrawal from the market, Bank of America (BOA) will become the
only supplier of foreign banknotes in Taiwan, the report said.</P>
      <P>The Central Bank of the Republic of China (Taiwan) believes, however, that BOA
can handle the added demand.</P>
      <P>"Although BOA will be the only bank that supplies foreign banknotes, it will be
asked to fully meet the needs of the people, " said Spencer Lin, head of the
central bank's Bureau of Foreign Exchange.</P>
      <P>Lin contended that the withdrawal of HSBC from the banknote market will not make
buying and selling of foreign exchange more expensive, and he said the central
bank has already asked BOA to supply banknotes for the same price as previously.</P>
      <P>HSBC said recently that it decided to stop the service because foreign currency
transaction procedures have become stricter and more complex since the attacks
on New York City on Sept. 11, 2001, due to the requirements  of anti-terrorist
and anti-money  laundering organizations.</P>

      <P>The Legislature will start an extraordinary session next week to screen a
recently signed trade pact with China and several critical bills, Legislative
Speaker Wang Jin-pyng said Friday.</P>
      <P>"The extra session will last two weeks, " Wang said after presiding over a
meeting of legislative caucus leaders of major political parties earlier in the
day.</P>
      <P>It was the only thing the legislative caucuses of the ruling and opposition
parties agreed on during the meeting, Wang said.</P>
      <P>The ruling and opposition camps remained divided on issues regarding the
screening of the economic cooperation  framework agreement (ECFA) with China,
such as whether the pact should be subject to a line-item review or be passed or
vetoed as a package.</P>
      <P>Wang said the issue will be further discussed at an informal plenary session
Monday.</P>
      <P>The upcoming extra session will be the second of its kind since the Kuomintang-
controlled Legislative Yuan went into summer recess.</P>
      <P>In addition to examining the ECFA deal, the session is also expected to screen
urgent bills presented by the ruling party, including five bills that will pave
the way for enforcing the ECFA as well as three bills that amend existing laws
to allow admission of Chinese students into local tertiary education
institutions.</P>
      <P>The five ECFA-related bills are an intellectual property rights protection
agreement with China and amendments to current trademark law,  patent law and
regulations on customs duties and plant registration.</P>
      <P>Also high on the KMT-proposed list are a package of draft amendments to the
National Health Insurance to smooth the way for the introduction of a second
generation health insurance program and draft revisions to the Public Officials
Election and Recall Law that will ensure no changes to the legislative
constituencies for 10 years.</P>
      <P>The legislative caucus of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP),
however, questioned the propriety of dealing with those bills in an extra
session.</P>
      <P>Ker Chien-ming, the party's top legislative whip,  said a provisional session
should only deal with urgent bills, while those that will have an impact on the
national well-being or popular interests should be addressed at regular
sessions.</P>
      <P>"Our stance is that the coming extra session should only screen the ECFA deal,
and its supplementary bills should be examined at the next normal legislative
session," Ker said, adding that the DPP will only submit a bill on holding an
ECFA referendum at the extra session.</P>

      <P>National Taiwan University (NTU) ranked 127th in Shanghai Jiao Tong University's
most recent annual ranking of world universities released Friday.</P>
      <P>NTU, one of Taiwan's most highly reputed academic institutions, moved up 23
notches from the year before, vaulting past the National University of Singapore
for the first time since the index began in 2003 to lead all universities in the
worldwide Chinese community.</P>
      <P>The National University of Singapore ranked 145th, falling from 140th in the
2009 ranking.</P>
      <P>Among Taiwan schools listed in the top 500, Taiwan's National Cheng Kung
University was ranked 256th, followed by National Chiao Tung University at 313th
and National Tsinghua University at 314th.</P>
      <P>In Hong Kong, the Chinese University of Hong Kong was the highest ranked at
179th, advancing 56 notches from its previous ranking. It was followed by the
University of Hong Kong at 207th.</P>
      <P>Beijing-based  Tsinghua University  was scored as the best university in China,
placing 191st in the ranking. Peking University, also located in Beijing, ranked
199th and was followed by Zhejiang University at 213.</P>
      <P>Harvard University in the United States remained ranked as the world's top
university for the eighth year in a row while the University of Tokyo in Japan,
which ranked 20th, was seen as the best university in Asia.</P>
      <P>The universities were evaluated based on criteria such as the number of Nobel
prizes and Fields medals won by staff and alumni, the number of highly cited
researchers on staff, and the number of articles by faculty published in Nature
and Science magazines.</P>
      <P>NTU said its move up the ladder proved the success of the government's project
to help domestic universities rank among the world's best academic centers. It
attributed much of its progress to being scored higher than in 2009 (16.1 to
10.3) for the number of highly cited researchers on the staff.</P>
      <P>The number of articles by faculty published in renowned academic magazines also
helped improve its ranking, NTU said.</P>
      <P>Beginning in 2005, the government subsidized top universities to upgrade
fundamental facilities, improve the content of the curriculum and integrate
research centers to help them be recognized as among the world's top

      <P>A visiting Chinese tourism official said Friday that the annual number of
Chinese tourists to Taiwan is expected to hit 3 million soon and urged the two
sides to make adequate preparations.</P>
      <P>"It has been two years since Taiwan opened itself to mainland tourists  and the
number of visiting tourists has since been increasing at a rate beyond our
expectations, " Shao Qiwei, chairman of the China National Tourism
Administration and the Cross-Strait Tourism Association, said at the opening
ceremony.</P>
      <P>"If things go well, the number of visits made by mainland tourists to Taiwan
could reach 1.2 million for 2010," he said, noting that "all direct cross-strait
flights fill up."</P>
      <P>The figure could exceed 1.5 million this year if the number of visiting Chinese
professionals is included, which would mark a 109 percent increase year on year,
Shao said.</P>
      <P>In 2009, Chinese tourists made 606,174 visits to Taiwan, up 200 percent from a
year earlier, according to Taiwan's official figures.</P>
      <P>Since Taiwan opened to Chinese tourists in July 2008, Chinese tourists -- who
are only allowed to travel in Taiwan as part of tour groups -- have made a total
of 1.28 million visits to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, the number of Chinese tourist arrivals to Taiwan should
soon beat the 3 million target, Shao said.</P>
      <P>Shao, at the head of a Chinese delegation, is visiting Taiwan to attend the 2010
Taipei Cross-Strait Travel Fair, which opened Friday and will run through Aug.
16.</P>
      <P>A record of nearly 1,200 representatives from 190 tourism associations or travel
agencies throughout China took part in the fair, the organizers added, saying
that a total of 871 booths are in use, including 516 by Taiwanese exhibitors.</P>
      <P>This year's fair is three times larger than past fairs.</P>
      <P>The organizers predicted that the total number of visitors to the fair would
surpass 150,000.</P>
      <P>While Chinese exhibitors showcased folk songs and dances and martial arts
performances at their booths, exhibitors at the Taiwan agricultural pavilion
provided samples of tea, dried fruit, nut crackers, sausages, dried squid and
other well-known local food.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan has very good agriculture and we hope to promote Taiwan's agricultural
products here at the fair, " exhibitor Lin Yu-ping told the Central News Agency
at the event.</P>
      <P>Janice Lai, director-general of Taiwan's Tourism Office and the Strait Tourism
and Travel Association, said Taiwanese made 4.08 million visits to China last
year, with the figure likely to hit 5 million this year.</P>
      <P>"We don't just want to appeal to Chinese tourists, but also those from other
parts of the world," she said.</P>
      <P>Wang Yixue, the honorary president of China's Huangshan Municipal Association of
Travel Services, told CNA that his association was taking part in the fair for
its fifth year in a row.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan has been a major source of tourists to Mount Huang and we want to use
this opportunity to help local people understand how to enjoy an in-depth tour
there," he said.</P>

      <P>Online security experts in Taiwan suggested on Friday that smartphone users
download software, update their phone systems, and take extra precautions when
visiting websites on their devices to avoid virus attacks.</P>
      <P>Samson Tai, the director of the sales engineering department at Taiwan's major
anti-virus solution provider Trend Micro Inc., urged smartphone users to pay
special attention when opening PDF or Flash files on webpages as there might be
security holes.</P>
      <P>"When you open a PDF file on your smartphone, a virus could invade your phone
and steal your information," he said.</P>
      <P>Tai urged users to keep updating their phone's operating systems or application
software as updates will fix security holes.</P>
      <P>Smartphone users are particularly vulnerable to giving away personal account and
password information on fake shopping or bank websites, Tai said.</P>
      <P>Many users often don't realize it when they are visiting fake websites on
smartphones because website addresses are either very small or hidden on mobile
phone screens for better viewing, " Tai told the Central News Agency in a
telephone interview.</P>
      <P>He suggested that smartphone users resort to anti-virus software that can help
them identify if the websites they are visiting are real or not.</P>
      <P>The issue of viruses attacking smartphone systems has gained urgency recently
after media reported that a Trojan virus has infected smartphones using the
increasingly popular Android platform.</P>
      <P>Luke Lin, an analyst with Taiwan's Digitimes Inc., told CNA that free anti-virus
software that can deal with the problem is available on the Internet, but he
said he expected cases of virus attacks on smartphones to increase as sales of
the phones grow.</P>
      <P>In one case last month, according to Lin, a wallpaper software for Google's
Android phones reportedly  stole users' personal information.</P>
      <P>Thomas Chuang, a consultant to the Taiwan branch of U.S. computer security giant
Symantec, said that in the past, hackers launched attacks for the sake of fame,
but the situation is different now.</P>
      <P>"Many of the attacks are now launched by crime groups to steal personal accounts
and passwords," Chuang told CNA by telephone.</P>
      <P>"Or they try to profit from having your smartphone send out large numbers of
text messages or wiretap your phone calls," he said.</P>
      <P>Far EasTone Telecommunications Co.,  Taiwan's third largest telecom operator
that sells Apple's iPhones, HTC smartphones and Nokia smartphones, has yet to be
hit by the bugs.</P>
      <P>"So far, we haven't heard of any such case in Taiwan or from our users, "
spokeswoman Alison Kao told CNA in a telephone interview.</P>
      <P>Chunghwa Telecom Co., Taiwan' largest telecom operator, also said that it was
not aware of any attacks on the smartphones it distributed.</P>

      <P>The monkeys often destroy crops such as lychees, longans, and bamboo shoots just
before the beginning of the harvest season, seriously damaging the crops, said
Li Kuo-hsiung, a farmer who said he was fed up with the ordeal.</P>
      <P>The worst thing is that the farmers aren't allowed to catch the monkeys, Li
said.</P>
      <P>The monkeys are protected under the Wildlife Conservation Law.</P>
      <P>In response to the farmers' complaints, Kaohsiung City Economic Development
Bureau Deputy Lin Ying-pin said the damage caused by the animals is not within a
wildlife conservation area, so it cannot be compensated.</P>
      <P>Once the Legislative Yuan finishes amending the national park law and makes Chai
mountain a national natural park, however, he said he would do everything
possible to help.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung City Councilor Li Chiao-ju urged the city government to assist the
farmers in applying for help.</P>
      <P>Li Kuo-hsiung's application for national compensation in 2004 was rejected by
the Supreme Court in 2007 because the farms were not in the wildlife
conservation area.</P>
      <P>Li and other farmers have been seeking the government's help since 2001, he
said.</P>

      <P>The Consumers' Foundation said Friday the government should tighten enforcement
of food labeling regulations as many snacks and soft drinks sold in the local

      <P>"In a recent spot inspection, 10 of the 15 food products we checked carried
names or illustrations that could mislead consumers," said Hsieh Tien-jen,
chairman of the foundation.</P>
      <P>A locally produced brand of oat flakes, for instance, has "Hokkaido" in its

the Japanese island of Hokkaido, Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>In another case, the packaging of a box crackers showed colorful pictures of
nearly 10 kinds of vegetables, but the crackers contained only one kind of

    <TEXT>
      <P>Next Media from Hong Kong, known for its sensationalist scoops and celebrity
gossip, launched an online video broadcasting service on July 30 after it
received the latest in a string of National Communications Commission (NCC)
rejections to its application for a cable TV license.</P>
      <P>Next Media has been rejected three times since it began applying in 2009.</P>
      <P>Many viewers of Next Media's online premiere were surprised by its content,
which they described as similar to DaAi TV, a Buddhist TV channel with news
programs focused on positive and inspiring stories.</P>
      <P>Perhaps it is the media group's strategy to win over the hearts of NCC
commissioners and convince them to approve its cable TV license. The group's
controversial CEO Jimmy Lai could face a big business crisis if the group's
future TV programs follow the same style.</P>
      <P>Lai is betting the company's future on TV with a NT$3 billion (US$93.75 million)
investment as its publications in Taiwan -- the newspaper Apple Daily and the
weekly Next Magazine -- saw last year's advertising revenues fall 4.9 percent
and 19.4 percent respectively.</P>
      <P>Only two of Next TV's five channels received approval from the NCC -- the movie
channel approved in March and the sports channel on July 28.</P>
      <P>While the company's sports channel was approved, however, its applications for
news,  entertainment,  and general information channels was put on hold for the
third time.</P>
      <P>Two days later, the company began streaming Next TV for free through the
station's website, which doesn't require government approval.</P>
      <P>Next TV's online broadcasting started with four one-hour live news programs and
an entertainment news show on weekdays, with replays of the programs filling the
rest of the day.</P>
      <P>To differentiate itself from other channels, Next Media has invested heavily in
equipment. All of its content is digitized and produced in high definition  --
well ahead of the Taiwanese government's goal of TV channels' digital conversion
in 2012.</P>
      <P>It also acquired scanning equipment used in Hollywood animation films so it can
produce 90-second clips about news stories in one and a half hours at the
reporter's request.</P>
      <P>While the company's print media in Taiwan often leads the agenda of local news
channels, its TV operation takes a more conservative approach. The station has a
team of senior editors dubbed "the internal NCC" that closely monitors and
advises on the content of each story.</P>
      <P>"There are no worries about not receiving licenses from the NCC, because Next
TV's news programming is so toned down now, it looks like advertisements
promoting government policy, " a Next TV anchor said.</P>
      <P>According to Lai, the monthly cost of running Next TV is NT$100 million.
Everyone is watching how long he can keep spending on the station before getting
the license and if he will keep the current style after the NCC's approval.</P>

      <P>The auctioning of goats at markets in the central Taiwan counties of Changhua
and Yunlin is expected to resume before Aug. 31 after a successful nationwide
inoculation against goat pox virus (GPV) , an official at the Council of
Agriculture said Friday.</P>
      <P>The massive GPV outbreak, which began with a case reported in Yunlin on April 9,
has been effectively controlled by the inoculation launched on June 22, said
Huang Kuo-ching, deputy director of the Bureau of Animal and Plant Health
Inspection and Quarantine under the council.</P>
      <P>According to the bureau, 99 percent -- or 225,159 heads -- of the goats in
Taiwan had been vaccinated as of Aug. 12.</P>
      <P>The number of affected goat farms declined from 98 in early July to 32 a month
later, the bureau said in a statement released Friday.</P>
      <P>While breeders and butchers all expressed concern over when goat trading would
resume, the bureau decided to hold a meeting of experts in the next few days to
determine whether the outbreak could be considered over, the statement said.</P>
      <P>According to bureau statistics, 186 goat farms were reported affected by GPV
between April 9 and June 22, during which 17,350 goats were culled.</P>
      <P>After the nationwide inoculation began, 347 farms were reported affected, with
5,206 goats culled.</P>
      <P>Huang said that some of the reported cases after the launch of the vaccination
occurred before the goats at those farms were given shots.</P>
      <P>There are around 2,500 goat farms in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Goat meat prices rose at meat markets in Changhua and Yunlin soon after the
outbreak, with the wholesale price growing from NT$140 (US$4.39) per kilogram to
between NT$190 and NT$210, according to Huang.</P>
      <P>GPV -- a highly contagious disease characterized by fever, ocular and nasal
discharges -- is spread via contact among the animals. GPV cannot infect humans
and can be destroyed by high temperatures.</P>
      <P>Taiwan first reported the virus in July 2008 in northern Taiwan's Taoyuan
County, an outbreak that is believed to have been related to animals smuggled in
from GPV-affected countries.</P>
      <P>At that time only two goat farms reported GPV infections and the disease was
brought under control in a week after culling the goats on the two farms, the
Council of Agriculture said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan High Court judge Kao Yu-shun recently revealed that in the trial of a
hit-and-run case involving the son of a Supreme Court judge, presiding judge Kao
Ming-che pressured her to acquit the defendant.</P>
      <P>The existence of young judges with strong professional ethics helps restore our
confidence in the judiciary, especially when corruption scandals involving
judicial personnel are snowballing.</P>
      <P>It is admirable for Kao Yu-shun to resist influence-peddling by the presiding
judge, given the stiff personnel system in judicial circles. Under such a
system, those appointed to the positions of presiding judge hold the position
permanently and have the power to decide on the promotion of secondary judges on
their panels.</P>
      <P>Owing to the culture in which judicial personnel tend to avoid offending their
seniors and superiors, justice is often swallowed by bureaucracy, allowing
bureaucrats to cover up for each other. Kao Yu-shun deserves our salute because
she broke this silence.</P>
      <P>To reform the judiciary, the system that sets no term limit for presiding judges
should be changed. We should also introduce a system of citizen jurors into
Taiwan to reduce the possibility of arbitrary judgments and corruption.

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan government faces challenges after ECFA: scholars</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  14 (CNA)
08/14/10  13:20:41

    <TEXT>
      <P>The signing of a historic trade pact between Taiwan and China was just the start
of a wide range of economic and political tasks for the Taiwanese government to
overcome and cautiously review, scholars said.</P>
      <P>The trade pact, known as the economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) ,
aims to liberalize cross-Taiwan Strait trade by eliminating tariffs and relaxing
regulations. The two sides signed the agreement on June 29 and its screening by
Taiwan's legislature is pending.</P>
      <P>Almost all discussions before the signing were focused on "the early-harvest
list, " which pinpoints sectors that benefit or suffer from the agreement.</P>
      <P>The pursuit for a bilateral investment agreement (BIA) and the implementation of
the ECFA, however, are now two of the most important issues at hand, said Jack
Lee, a professor of economics at National Open University.</P>
      <P>The BIA is not a new issue, and it's especially important for Taiwan because
signing one with China would not only protect Taiwanese investors and
businessmen in China,  where laws and regulations are frequently not respected
or implemented, but also attract foreign investment because the BIA would ensure
foreign investors they are protected, Lee said.</P>
      <P>Complaints of cross-strait business disputes filed to the Straits Exchange
Foundation, a quasi-official organization that handles negotiations between
Taiwan and China, increased from 291 in 2007 to 784 in 2009.</P>
      <P>The issue of sovereignty -- one of the most sensitive and controversial topics
in Taiwan-China relations -- would come into play if the sides tried to settle
disputes through the World Trade Organization (WTO) , he said, adding that the
method does not look feasible because it would take too much time.</P>
      <P>Lee also said that Taiwan's and China's goals after the signing of the ECFA are
different. While Taiwan is looking to protect its businesses with investment
protection mechanisms, China is eyeing investment promotion, which means Taiwan
would need to allow more Chinese investment flow.</P>
      <P>"Current Chinese investment in Taiwan is less than US$100 million. China wants
Taiwan to further open its door, " he said. "But Taiwan is not ready yet,
fearing its national security would be jeopardized and its know-how would be
'stolen' if more Chinese investment came in."</P>
      <P>If these concerns can be resolved by putting every detail down in writing, Lee
said Taiwan will be able to attract more foreign investors by allowing more
Chinese investment.</P>
      <P>William Lin, a professor of finance at Tamkang University, said that Taiwan's
intention to develop its service sectors in China will likely hit a snag in the
financial and air transport industries.</P>
      <P>"Financial service is such a sensitive and complicated sector that it's
difficult to open to foreigners in any country. And Taiwan's businesses have
been disappointed at China's unwillingness to open its air transportation market
so far," Lin said.</P>
      <P>Chang Wu-yueh, a political scientist at Tamkang University, said that
politically,  the "success" in ECFA negotiations  reduces cross-strait tension
and lays the foundation for more exchange, but it doesn't mean both sides are
ready to engage in a comprehensive dialogue, especially a political one.</P>
      <P>"In cross-strait negotiations, some see business opportunities and some see more
than 1,300 missiles directed at Taiwan. The real answer probably lies somewhere
in between," Chang said.</P>
      <P>He advised the Taiwan government to assess China's different mindsets and goals
of bilateral exchanges in three stages -- between June 2010, when the ECFA is
signed; the time the deal is ratified and implemented leading up to the 2012
presidential election; and after 2013, when Chinese President Hu Jintao has
retired and handed power to his successor.</P>
      <P>Despite signs the people of Taiwan are generally happy with the current
direction of cross-strait relations development, Taiwan's China policy has
always been controversial and partisan domestically. That is why support for
bilateral political talks is far weaker than for trade talks, Chang said.</P>
      <P>Moreover, he said, the results of more bilateral trade exchange have not yet
trickled down to benefit the general public, nor have they boosted Taiwan's
national economy.</P>
      <P>Chang said that with people growing impatient, key factors for the Taiwan
government to win support for future negotiations include its success in landing
more free trade agreements with major trading partners; boosting gross domestic
product (GDP) growth; lowering the unemployment rate; and bridging the wealth
gap.</P>

    <DATELINE>08/14/10  15:03:14
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet recently proposed an amendment to the Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Act to
re-categorize rice wine that contains less than 20 percent alcohol as "cooking
wine." This means the product would be subject to an alcohol tax of just NT$9
per liter, which would cut its price by half to NT$25 per bottle.</P>
      <P>In response to concerns raised by the United States and the European Union over
the matter, the government explained that cooking wine is no substitute for
alcoholic drinks and promised to tax imported cooking wine at the same rate as
rice wine. Vice Premier Sean Chen even offered to treat World Trade Organization
(WTO) member states to "wine chicken soup" to help them understand Taiwan's
special culinary culture.</P>
      <P>In fact, these countries are well aware of the status of rice wine in Taiwanese
culture. But by insisting that rice wine be listed under the category of
distilled spirits, they are hoping that Taiwan would drop its tax on all
distilled spirits.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan government should expose the true intentions of these countries and
make it clear that imported distilled spirits already enjoy lower tax rates in
Taiwan than in many other countries.</P>
      <P>If the vice premier believes the matter can be resolved by offering the WTO
members "wine chicken soup," the government might as well declare rice wine a

    <HEADLINE>HTC foray into China not expected to deliver quick payoff</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>08/14/10  15:15:06</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwanese smartphone marker HTC Corp. formally launched branded products in
China in late July, hoping to duplicate its branding success in other markets
and eventually push past Apple as the world's third largest smartphone vendor.</P>
      <P>Before the launch, HTC had marketed its products in China under the Dopod brand
after acquiring Dopod International in 2007 but felt the time had come to
promote its own brand.</P>
      <P>"We are proud to introduce the HTC brand in China and look forward to bringing a
fresh customer-centric smartphone experience to consumers in China, " said HTC
Chairwoman Cher Wang on the day of the launch.</P>
      <P>Analysts caution, however, that China's market is not likely to become a major
contributor to HTC's revenues anytime soon.</P>
      <P>"While we believe China is an important smartphone market, given the sizeable
subscriber base, it may not emerge as a key revenue driver for HTC in the next
1-2 years, " said Jeff Pu, an analyst with Taipei-based Fubon Securities
Investment Services Co., in a statement on July 30.</P>
      <P>"I think the main reason for this is that China still has a small 3G market,
while HTC is too big. As a result, the Chinese market will make a limited
contribution to HTC, " he told the Central News Agency in an e-mail message on
Aug. 10.</P>
      <P>Luke Lin, an analyst with Taipei-based research firm DigiTimes, agreed with Pu
and said in a recent e-mail message that so far, revenues from China's market
account for only a very small part of HTC's total revenues, though he did not
have a specific number.</P>
      <P>HTC declined to offer details when contacted by the Central News Agency Friday.</P>
      <P>From the second half of this year, however, Lin believes Chinese telecom
operators will significantly increase their subsidization and procurement of
smartphones, which could begin to have an impact on HTC, the world's eighth
largest mobile phone maker.</P>
      <P>China was the world's second largest smartphone market for the sixth consecutive
quarter in the second quarter of 2010. During the period, 6.9 million
smartphones, representing 11 percent of the worldwide total, were sold in China,
second only to United States where 14.7 million units, or 23 percent of global
shipments, were sold, research firm Canalys said on Aug. 2.</P>
      <P>At an investor conference on July 29, HTC Chief Financial Officer Cheng Hui-ming
acknowledged that sales in China will not contribute much to HTC's total
revenues in the third quarter of this year but said it would be a key market in
the future.</P>
      <P>Dopod had only a 1.6 percent share of China's smartphone market in the first
quarter of this year, ranking eighth, falling far behind Apple, which was in
sixth place with a 5.4 percent share, according to recent figures by Chinese
marketing agency Analysys International.</P>
      <P>Nokia is the top smartphone seller in China with a 29.3 percent share, the
figures showed.</P>
      <P>Peter Chou, chief executive officer of HTC, vowed late last month that HTC will
become one of China's top three smartphone brands in the next two or three
years.</P>
      <P>Kelly Hsieh of Taiwan's Topology Research Institute recently told the Central
News Agency that she is optimistic that HTC will reach its goal based on similar
patterns in the European and North American markets, where it also took two to
three years to emerge as a major brand.</P>
      <P>Chou recently told reporters that at present, 8 percent of smartphone users in
China are aware of HTC, even though HTC has never sold its products there under
its own brand.</P>
      <P>Chou explained that because many Chinese consumers have owned HTC models through
parallel imports -- authentic goods imported into a country without the
authorization of the brand -- the HTC brand has established a good reputation in
China.</P>
      <P>While some analysts were optimistic about HTC prospects in China, daunting
challenges still loom, including competition from strong foreign competitors in
China, according to Lin, who said HTC could also not ignore Chinese rivals.</P>
      <P>Hsieh felt that an increase in cheap knock-offs in China's market could also
present a major hurdle.</P>
      <P>"Based on previous experience, the prices of knockoff 'future phones' are half
or even one-third of branded future phones, " she said in a recent telephone
interview, referring to phones that have no operating system but can still go
online. By Alex Jiang CNA staff reporter</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Judicial Yuan on Friday suspended three more judges accused of corruption
and influence  peddling  following  an in-house self-discipline meeting.</P>
      <P>Supreme Court Judge Hsiao Yang-kuei was accused of influence peddling for his
son in a hit-and-run case, while High Court Chief Judge Kao Ming-che was
suspected of acquitting Hsiao's son. Another high court judge,  Yang Ping-chen,
was charged with visiting prostitutes.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from the local media coverage of the issue:</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>Although prosecutors still need to conduct an in-depth probe into their
allegedly unethical activities, the Judicial Yuan has referred the three judges
to the government's highest watch dog, the Control Yuan, for further
investigation.</P>
      <P>This was the second time that the Judicial Yuan blew the whistle on problematic
judges since July 13, when three other judges were arrested on charges of taking
bribes.</P>
      <P>According to the Judicial Yuan, the decision by the High Court and the Supreme
Court to discipline judges indicates the judiciary's strong determination to
conduct self-examinations after a string of corruption scandals.</P>
      <P>If deemed punishable by a disciplinary committee after being censured by the
Control Yuan, the six judges could be dismissed from their posts, demoted or
receive demerits.</P>
      <P>Control Yuan President Wang Chien-shien urged all government employees Friday to
behave themselves and lamented that the recent spate of corruption scandals in
connection to judges and prosecutors has deeply dampened the image of the
judiciary and hurt public confidence in it.</P>
      <P>Wang vowed to exercise his power as the head of the judicial system. "This is
the way we show our love for Taiwan, " he explained. (Aug. 14, 2010).</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>In response to the judiciary's series of in-house cleanups, President Ma Ying-

ming's resolve to crack down on corrupt personnel.</P>
      <P>Ma said he is in favor of establishing an "exit mechanism" for judges and
described it as a "necessary pain." (Aug. 14, 2010).</P>
      <P>The Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>While the president fully endorses Huang's drive to wipe out corruption in the
judiciary, several lawmakers and Control Yuan members contended that the
Judicial Yuan should get to the bottom of all the cases by handing them over to

    <HEADLINE>Garlic prices triple in Taiwan</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Garlic prices have tripled in Taiwan compared with the same time last year
because local farmers raised their wholesale prices following shortages in
China, an official at the Council of Agriculture said Saturday.</P>
      <P>According to Agriculture and Food Agency Secretary-General Hsu Han-ching, even
though garlic imports only accounted for about 8 percent  of the vegetable's
supplies  in Taiwan,  the recent international garlic price surge still pushed
up local prices.</P>
      <P>Soaring global garlic prices were mostly due to a crop decrease in China -- the
world's largest garlic producer -- because of recent bad weather, Hsu said.</P>
      <P>"Although the source of our garlic imports has been Argentina, not China, and
they only accounted for about 8 percent of the entire garlic supply in Taiwan,
local garlic prices still rocketed to about NT$100 (US$3.1) per kilogram this
week," Hsu said.</P>
      <P>Garlic was NT$81 per kilogram earlier in August and NT$30 at the same time last
year, Hsu said, adding that the council will closely monitor the vegetable's
price moves.</P>
      <P>Garlic import prices were quoted at US$1,850 to US$2,000 per ton recently,
before a NT$27 per kilogram tax is imposed, bringing the cost of imported garlic
to NT$90-NT$95 per kilogram, Hsu said.</P>
      <P>Hsu also pointed out that Taiwan's garlic production, affected by hot weather
and rains, was only expected to reach 45,619 tons this year -- down 3,980 tons,
or 8 percent, from last year.</P>
      <P>The smaller local crop will be supplemented by imports as agreed under the World
Trade Organization. Argentinean garlic usually arrives in Taiwan between October
and December, following the South American country's harvest season.</P>
      <P>Hsu said that local production and imports of garlic -- totaling 49,000 tons --
this year will almost be the same as the country's usual garlic consumption --
between 48,000 and 50,000 tons annually.</P>

Changhua County over an issue of land expropriation for the Central Taiwan
Science Park's fourth-phase expansion project, Premier Wu Den-yih said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Wu told reporters that some of the farmers in the Siangsiliao community are
happy that they can keep their homes, but they also hope that their farmlands
can be acquired by the government, which has offered them very high
compensation.</P>
      <P>Further negotiations will be held with the farmers on this issue, Wu said.</P>
      <P>The land dispute in Siangsiliao arose after the Taipei High Administrative Court

project at the Erlin site until the environmental impact assessment (EIA) has
been sorted out.</P>
      <P>The Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) in November 2009 conditionally
approved the EIA for the project.  However residents of Siangsiliao later
petitioned the court to annul the assessment and revoke the development permit
for the project, saying they were dissatisfied with the EIA.</P>
      <P>The matter was resolved in a meeting Friday between Wu and representatives of
Siangsiliao, with the government agreeing to preserve the two-hectare
residential area.</P>
      <P>As to the 10 hectares of farmland, the owners were given the option of either
accepting the compensation offered by the government to buy farmland elsewhere
or choosing an alternative plot in exchange for their existing property.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou voiced support Saturday for legislation to allow Chinese
students to enter local colleges and universities, saying that doing so will lay
a solid foundation for building permanent peace across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>"Such an opening is conducive to cross-strait peace, sharpening the
competitiveness of Taiwanese students and helping local colleges and
universities recruit more students, " Ma said while addressing a Buddhist summer
camp at Fokuangshan Monastery in southern Taiwan's Kaohsiung County.</P>
      <P>"To pursue everlasting peace in the strait, we should create chances that allow
youth from the two sides to know each other at an earlier stage," the president
said.</P>
      <P>"The enrollment of hard-working Chinese students at Taiwan's colleges and
universities should help lift the level of their local peers, and this is
something that Taiwanese students strongly need, " he added.</P>
      <P>As many members attending the camp are from China, Ma touted it as a result of
improved cross-strait relations since he took office in May 2008.</P>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan is slated to hold its second extra session next week to
deal with several bills, including three amendments designed to allow the
admission of Chinese students into local tertiary education institutions.</P>
      <P>The first extra legislative meeting in the current summer recess ended in July
amid clashes between lawmakers of the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) and the opposition
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) due to a divide over how to review the
economic cooperation  framework agreement (ECFA) signed with China on June 29.</P>
      <P>According to the Taiwan Thinktank, 81.7 percent of respondents in a recent
survey that it conducted said that limits and restrictions should be imposed on
the entry of Chinese students.</P>
      <P>The DPP has demanded that "three limits" and "six noes" be included on the law
amendments.</P>
      <P>The "three limits" refer to restrictions on the number of Chinese universities
that the government plans to recognize, the total number of Chinese college
students who can enter Taiwan to study, and a limit on the types of Chinese
diplomas that will be accredited in Taiwan. The "six noes" would ban Chinese
students from receiving scholarships or professional licenses, keep them from
working or staying in Taiwan upon graduation, ban them from receiving extra
points on examinations, and they would not be allowed to take part in civil
service examinations.</P>
      <P>Nearly 55 percent of the people surveyed did not support the proposal to
recognize Chinese diplomas, compared with 41.5 percent who favored the idea,
Taiwan Thinktank officials told a news conference Saturday while announcing the
survey results.</P>
      <P>Over 60 percent of those polled said they opposed allowing Chinese students to
work in Taiwan part-time or stay in Taiwan after graduating,  while 81.4 percent
objected to permitting Chinese students to obtain professional certification or

      <P>Kuomintang (KMT) Secretary-General King Pu-tsung arrived in Los Angeles Thursday
to rally support for his party among overseas Taiwanese in the run up to the
Nov. 27 mayoral elections in five special municipalities in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Speaking with reporters at his hotel, King said he will explain to Taiwanese
expatriates in the U.S. the details of the recent economic cooperation framework
agreement (ECFA) with China and the pact's role in helping to shape a new
"golden decade" for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Asked whether he thought the ECFA would be ratified by the Legislative Yuan
before the mayoral elections, King said most Taiwanese are aware of the
importance of the trade deal and that the opposition Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) would pay a price if it decides to go against mainstream public
opinion.</P>
      <P>On the issue of incumbent Kaohsiung County Magistrate Yang Chiu-hsing's decision
to run for mayor of Kaohsiung municipality as an independent, King said it has
added an element of uncertainty to the race, which might be in the KMT's favor.</P>
      <P>Yang and incumbent Tainan City Mayor Hsu Tain-tsai, both of the DPP, have bucked
the results of their party's primaries and decided to run as independents. Their
decision has given rise to speculations that the DPP's strongholds in southern
Taiwan could be breached.</P>
      <P>On his U.S. trip, King hailed the KMT's candidates in Taipei, Xinbei and
Taichung cities as being more capable than their DPP rivals of building a better
life for the residents of those areas.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, the DPP candidate for Taipei City, Su Tseng-chang, also
arrived in Los Angeles on the first leg of a five-day visit to seek support
among overseas Taiwanese.</P>

      <P>Demand for flowers ahead of Chinese Valentine's Day is higher than it was before
the this year's Western Valentine's Day, vendors at Taiwan's largest flower
market said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Because Feb. 14 -- Valentine's Day in Western culture -- fell on the first day
of the Chinese New Year, most people spent the day with their extended families
instead of going out on dates, said a flower seller in Tianwei Township,
Changhua County.</P>
      <P>This affected flower sales, some of the vendors in the flower-growing township
said, noting that Chinese Valentine's day this year falls on a Monday -- Aug.
16.</P>
      <P>The vendors said that demand for roses in particular has been high but
production has been lower than usual because of high temperatures.</P>
      <P>The auction price of roses jumped this year to NT$140 (US$4.4) per 10-stem bunch
in the week before Chinese Valentine's Day, compared to NT$115 per bunch during
the same period last year, the wholesale flower market in Tianwei reported.</P>
      <P>Over the past two days, strong demand has pushed up the wholesale price of roses
to NT$200 a bunch, with high quality stems fetching as much as NT$400 per bunch,
according to some vendors.</P>
      <P>Pink, purple and red roses are selling the fastest, one vendor said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Taipei Flower Auction Corp. offered some advice to men on
choosing the right color roses.</P>
      <P>Red roses should be given to lovers, white roses to secret admirers, and pink
roses to someone with whom the relationship is ambiguous, the flower company
said.</P>
      <P>Chinese Valentine's Day is usually celebrated on the seventh day of the seventh
month on the lunar calendar.</P>

      <P>China will allow individuals to visit Taiwan for tourism purposes when the
conditions are right, a visiting tourism official from China said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Shao Qiwei, director of China's National Tourism Administration and head of the
Cross-Strait Tourism Association (CSTA) , said that China will seek to revise
the relevant regulations on the basis of a "gradual opening" policy.</P>
      <P>"The CSTA will consult with its Taiwanese counterpart, the Taiwan Strait Tourism
Association (TSTA), and will select suitable cities to start allowing visits by
individual tourists when the time and conditions are right," he said.</P>
      <P>He said the move will be in line with world trends, and will help to enhance
people-to-people exchanges between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The regulations on both sides would need to be revised, he said, noting that
currently tourists from China are only allowed to visit Taiwan in groups.</P>
      <P>Shao was at a roundtable meeting in Hsinchu on cross-strait tourism exchanges,
which was chaired jointly by him and Taiwan's Tourism Bureau Director-General
Janice Lai. More than 100 tourism officials and representatives across the
Taiwan Strait attended the meeting.</P>
      <P>Shao said that two years after the easing of restrictions on visits by Chinese
tourists to Taiwan, cross-strait tourism is still in the budding stage.</P>
      <P>However, with the June 29 signing of a cross-strait trade deal, known as the
economic cooperation framework agreement, bilateral economic cooperation has
entered a historic new stage, he said</P>
      <P>He also said that he will push for bilateral tourism investment and that both
sides should compile a priority list for such investment.</P>
      <P>In response, Lai said that because of the difference in market sizes on both
sides, "the travel agent sector cannot be liberalized."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, China Tourism Academy President Dai Bin said that Fujian province,
which has the highest volume of exchanges with Taiwan, would be the best choice
to begin allowing individual visits to Taiwan.</P>

      <P>Ruling  Kuomintang  (KMT) Secretary-General King Pu-tsung met with Taiwanese
expatriates on the west coast of the U.S. over lunch Saturday to rally support
for the party in the run up to the Nov. 27 mayoral elections in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>King, known to be a close friend of President Ma Ying-jeou, was greeted
enthusiastically by the 500-odd guests at the luncheon who were all competing
for his autograph and to have photos taken with him.</P>
      <P>King's entourage included KMT legislators representing the five special
municipalities that will be up for grabs in the mayoral elections.</P>
      <P>In an address at the luncheon, King explained the details of the economic
cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) with China and the pact's role in helping
to shape a new "golden decade" for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He said the ECFA has been referred to the Legislative Yuan for screening and
ratification through a democratic process in an extraordinary session over the
next two weeks.</P>
      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has accused the KMT of
deliberately  blocking a nationwide referendum  on the cross-strait trade pact.</P>
      <P>King said the DPP owes the Taiwanese people an explanation on why it is opposed
to the ECFA, which he said was hard-earned and would be beneficial to most of
the people and companies in Taiwan in the long run.</P>
      <P>In a chat with the media after the luncheon, King said it would be good news for
residents of the greater Taipei area if Hau Lung-bin and Eric Liluan Chu, the
KMT candidates in Taipei City and Xinbei City (New Taipei County) respectively,
were elected.</P>
      <P>"Hau and Chu would join hands to develop the greater Taipei area," King said.</P>
      <P>His comment was a reference to a reported rift between the DPP candidates in
those two municipalities, Su Tseng-chang and Tsai Ing-wen.</P>
      <P>King and his delegation were scheduled to head to San Francisco later Saturday
for another rally there. He was also scheduled to meet with experts on cross-

    <HEADLINE>Economic Daily News: Where to stash huge insurance funds?</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>08/15/10  14:09:34
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Local insurers are sitting on idle funds that, according to Taiwan Insurance
Institute estimates, had exceeded NT$10 trillion (US$312.5 billion) as of the
end of May.</P>
      <P>That amount is six times the central government's annual budget. Each year,
budget officials have to beat their brains out to make ends meet, while insurers
are having a hard time finding ways to utilize their huge funds.</P>
      <P>According to the latest data from the Taiwan Insurance Institute, about NT$800
billion, or 8 percent, of insurers' funds is parked in banking accounts. As the
domestic interest rates have fallen far below capital costs, many insurers have
incurred losses from the spread.</P>
      <P>To help insurers tide over their difficulties, the Financial Supervisory
Commission (FSC) recently announced several new measures for them to diversify
their investment portfolios. The plans include lifting the ban on buying stocks
and bonds in China and allowing them to calculate real estate investment returns
as part of their risk-based capital ratios (RBC).</P>
      <P>However, these measures are still not enough to fix the "cash flood" issue.
There is still room for more action by the government. For starters, the FSC's
Bureau of Insurance and Bureau of Securities and Futures should work together to
establish a hedge fund for insurers to protect them from drastic fluctuations in
foreign exchange rates. This will encourage them to seek higher-yield investment
tools abroad.</P>
      <P>In addition, the government should put well-devised state bonds on the market,
which would allow insurers to receive annual investment  returns  while
channeling  their money into public infrastructure construction projects.
Because of their slow maturity, traditional state bonds are usually not
attractive to local insurers, who need a steady income to stay afloat.

    <HEADLINE>Talk of the day -- Taoyuan Airport management reform</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>08/15/10  15:09:22
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The results of a recent survey conducted by a Taiwan Taoyuan International
Airport management  improvement  panel show that passengers remain dissatisfied
with more than 10 aspects of the service at the airport.</P>
      <P>The panel, which was formed last month after the airport administration was hit
by a raft of problems, is scheduled to meet again on Aug. 20 to work out the
areas that should be given priority for improvement, based on the findings of
the survey.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from local media coverage of the issue:</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>In a survey conducted over the last month, Taoyuan airport -- Taiwan's main
gateway -- was given a rating of 3.5 on a 5-point scale designed by the Airports
Council International (ACI) to assess airport service quality.</P>
      <P>"The results of the passenger survey indicate that there is room for improvement
of the quality of service at the Taoyuan airport, " said Chang You-heng, dean of
National Cheng Kung University's College of Management and head of the airport
management task force.</P>
      <P>According to the survey, passengers were most dissatisfied with the high cost
and poor quality of food at the airport, badly written or confusing signs and
lack of convenient transportation to other cities in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chang said the panel is conducting an in-depth analysis of the survey findings
and will make recommendations for improvement of the service at the airport.</P>
      <P>"We are confident  that if the civil aviation authorities faithfully implement
the recommendations, Taoyuan airport will return to the list of top 10 airports
the world within three years, " he added. (Aug. 15, 2010).</P>
      <P>Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>When the Taoyuan airport administration is converted into a corporation in
November as part of the efforts to upgrade the service and efficiency at the
airport, the Aviation Police Office (APO) will withdraw from passenger and cargo
inspection duty.</P>
      <P>Since the Taiwan Garrison Command was disbanded in the late 1980s when martial
law ended in Taiwan, the APO has been responsible for security checks of inbound
passengers and luggage. In many cases, the duties of the APO overlap with those
of customs officers.</P>
      <P>Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) Director Yin Cheng-pong said his office
is consulting with the APO to gradually reduce the APO's involvement in security
checks. This will bring the airport in line with international gateways where
security is handled only by customs authorities, he said.</P>
      <P>Withdrawing the APO from security duties will save the government an estimated
NT$2.6 billion (US$81.25 million). (Aug. 15, 2010).</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>Taipei's Shihlin night market is running neck-and-neck with Kaohsiung City's
Liuho in an online competition for best night market of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The online  voting is part of a Tourism  Bureau-sponsored promotional program to
attract more tourists to Taiwan. The voting is scheduled to end at midnight
Sunday.</P>
      <P>As of midnight Saturday, Liuho beat all other major local night markets in five
of the six indicators examined in the competition (most   environmentally-
friendly,   most  fascinating,   most visitors-friendly, easiest to shop at and
most special) , while Shihlin only led in the "best food" category.(Aug. 15,

    <TEXT>
      <P>A task force that was appointed to help improve the overall service at Taiwan
Taoyuan International Airport advised Sunday that the airport should be exempted
from the Public Procurement Act to give it more operational flexibility.</P>
      <P>Chang Yu-hern, dean of the College of Management at National Cheng Kung
University and the head of the task force, said that although the airport will
be converted into a state-run company in November, it will still be subject to
the limitations of the act, which will not leave much room for improvement of
its quality of service and efficiency.</P>
      <P>The best approach to resolving the airport's management problems is to adopt the
"China Steel Corp. Operation Model", the task force suggested after a one-month
evaluation, referring to Taiwan's largest steel company's special exemption from
the procurement act.</P>
      <P>Deputy Minister of Transportation and Communications (MOTC) Yeh Kuang-shih said
Sunday that the ministry will use the group's recommendations to push for the
relevant law amendments. However, he admitted it will not be an easy task, as
the executive and legislative branches of government are likely to resist such
an approach.</P>
      <P>The task force has also completed a survey of travelers who passed through the
airport, which is Taiwan's main gateway, and will publish the results Aug. 20.</P>
      <P>The task force was assembled last month amid reports of several problems at the
airport, including poor catering services, a shortage of baggage carts and the
sudden collapse of a jet bridge.</P>
      <P>In its first meeting July 13, the task force recommended that the government
devise strong measures to address the problems.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Sunday at a Buddhist ceremony that the kindness of
the Taiwan people becomes evident in the seventh month on the lunar calendar
because it is a time when rituals are held to placate the souls of the dead,
whether or not they have relatives in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>At the Maha Sanghikadana gathering in Taichung, Ma said the Buddhist Pudu rites
in the month of August to ease the sufferings of the dead are unique and have
special significance in Taiwanese society.</P>
      <P>The ritual, which was held this year at Taichung Shuinan Economic and Trade
Park, featured a food offering to the community of monks, or Sanghikadana, to
honor the parents -- both living and dead -- of the worshippers.</P>
      <P>In Chinese tradition, the seventh month on the lunar calendar is regarded as
Ghost Month when the spirits of the dead rise.</P>
      <P>Activities during Ghost Month include ritualistic food offerings and the burning
of incense and joss paper, known as ghost money, to honor the visiting spirits.</P>
      <P>Ma said that the month-long ceremonies and rituals not only demonstrate filial
piety for the deceased, but also highlight the religious and brotherly concern
for the souls of those who died in a strange land.</P>
      <P>Sunday's Pudu Ghost Festival had special significance because it was held to
also pray for those who died during Typhoon Morakot last year, he said.</P>
      <P>Some 5,000 Buddhist monks and nuns and 5,000 followers attended the ceremony,
which was in its 23rd year.</P>

      <P>Taiwanese choreographer Sun Chuo-Tai will present a new dance piece this month
in Taipei, focusing on the concept of distance between lovers and between
parents and children.</P>
      <P>The one-hour dance, titled "Ripple Effect, " will be performed by five dancers
with backgrounds in classical dance, contemporary dance, street dance, Beijing
opera and gymnastics, said Sun, the director of 8213 Physical Dance Theater.</P>
      <P>Each dancer  will bring  their  individual  style  to the interpretation of the
piece, and present it in a humorous context, he told the Central News Agency.</P>
      <P>"I expect to present an interesting modern dance that contains traditional

      <P>Another highlight of the presentation will be the lighting, he said.</P>
      <P>The stage will be very big and will be lit by more than 700 small LED lights, he

      <P>"It will be a big challenge for the dancers, as they must synchronize their
movements with the lights," Sun said.</P>
      <P>During the rehearsals, he said, he had to draw a diagram for the dancers so that
they could memorize where the lights are located on the stage and when they will
go on and off.</P>
      <P>"The LED lights appear very unreal, but are actually becoming a reality of
everyday life, " he said, noting that they can be seen everywhere on the streets
of Taipei City at night.</P>
      <P>"That is the image I want to create -- an unreal world, but one that appears
real to audiences," he said. The show will be staged at the Experimental Theater

administration to ram through a National Health Insurance (NHI)  reform plan
during a special legislative session next week.</P>
      <P>Huang Yu-sheng, secretary-general of the Consumers' Foundation, said at a news
conference that the government should first consider how to close the loopholes
in the NHI program rather than try to push changes through the legislature in
haste.</P>
      <P>Legislators from the different party caucuses are scheduled to meet Monday to
work out an agenda for a special legislative sitting on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The KMT administration is eager to have the legislature ratify an economic
cooperation framework agreement with China, and pass law revisions to allow
local colleges to admit Chinese students and to revamp the debt-ridden NHI
program.</P>
      <P>One of the KMT's reform proposals is to calculate NHI premiums on the basis of
total household income rather than on the salaries of individuals.</P>
      <P>However, Huang said, in most cases, the revenue authorities have no way of
accurately determining the total income of households.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that premiums were raised in April to help the NHI program tide
over a financial crisis. Therefore, there should be no rush to revamp it now, he
said.</P>
      <P>"The Bureau of National Health Insurance should think how to close the loopholes
in the program, especially in the payments for the cost of medicine, which lead
to waste."</P>
      <P>Yang Hsiao-jong, a director of the Consumers' Foundation, said the revision to
the program is expected to have far reaching ramifications.</P>
      <P>"It would be reckless to pass the reform bill in the special legislative
sitting, " he said. "The program needs to be overhauled, but it is better to
forge consensus through regular legislative procedures, including public
hearings."</P>
      <P>On April 1, the Department of Health raised the NHI premium rate from 4.55
percent of individual salary to 5.17 percent, he noted, adding that this measure
should help the program stay afloat for the next two years.</P>
      <P>He urged voters to punish lawmakers in the next elections if they vote for NHI
reform during the special legislative next week.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP candidate renews pledge not to run for president if elected</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Los Angeles,  Aug. 14 (CNA)

(By Jorge Liu and Y.L. Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) candidate for mayor of Taipei
City, Su Tseng-chang, said Saturday in Los Angeles that he would serve a full
four-year term if he wins and would not consider a presidential run during that
time.</P>
      <P>Su  was  responding  to a challenge  by Kuomintang  (KMT) Secretary-General King
Pu-tsung that Su would not dare promise to serve out the four-year term if
elected.</P>
      <P>King is also in Los Angeles to rally support for his party among overseas
Taiwanese in the run up to the Nov. 27 mayoral elections in five special
municipalities in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In a meeting with the press, Su said that as part of an election tactic, the KMT
government devised a plan to create five special municipalities in Taiwan,
instead three as was originally planned. This has given the DPP a good chance
of winning  all five municipalities, he said.</P>
      <P>He said that the KMT is using the economic cooperation framework agreement
(ECFA) with China as the main plank of its election campaign platform in an
attempt to divert the people's attention away from the KMT candidates'
incompetence.</P>
      <P>It is the people who should determine  the benefits  and disadvantages of the
ECFA, Su said, adding that the KMT government has twice rejected an initiative
to hold a referendum on the trade pact.</P>
      <P>The ECFA has not been central to the DPP's mayoral election campaign because in
local elections, voters are most concerned about local problems, not matters
like the cross-strait trade pact, he said.</P>
      <P>In response to King's remark that the KMT is more united than the DPP in the
elections, Su said the ruling party has its own unity problems.</P>
      <P>The exchanges on lack of party unity were made against the backdrop of a DPP
magistrate's decision to ignore the result of the party's primary and run as an
independent in the mayoral election.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung County Magistrate Yang Chiu-hsing announced earlier this month that he
will run against the DPP's selected candidate Kaohsiung City Mayor Chen Chu,
while Tainan Mayor Hsu Tain-tsair is expected to make a similar announcement
soon.</P>
      <P>However, it has been reported that KMT local factions in the two southern
municipalities are throwing their weight behind the DPP or independent
candidates because the KMT's chances of winning in those areas are very slim.</P>
      <P>Su also dismissed as untrue a comment by King that there is a rift between him
and DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen that dates back to when he was premier and she
was vice premier.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Sunday that it is beyond his ability to sell out
Taiwan, but he could probably help to sell the country's products.</P>
      <P>During a visit to central Taiwan to promote a recently signed economic
cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) with China, Ma said he must agree with a
politician who said recently the president is incapable of subverting Taiwan's
interests to China's.</P>
      <P>"I could probably help my countrymen sell fruits, groupers and milk fish to
China, but I'm definitely incapable of selling out Taiwan," the president said.</P>
      <P>The ECFA is not a cure-all, but it could help Taiwan's businesses reduce  trade
barriers  and  improve  their  international competitiveness, he said at the
head offices of Johnson Health Tech Co. in Taichung County.</P>
      <P>Ma, who is an avid jogger, likened Taiwan's trade barriers to iron shackles that
retarded a jogger's stride.</P>
      <P>"The signing of the ECFA is like giving that jogger a pair of lightweight
sneakers that would help him to run fast, " the president said.</P>
      <P>He said that since Taiwan concluded the ECFA with China, many companies have
decided to remain in Taiwan and some have decided to invest more in the domestic
economy.</P>
      <P>"There have been over 400 reports globally about the cross-strait ECFA since it
was signed on June 29 and almost all of them have been positive," he said.</P>
      <P>He added that the ECFA is not just about tariff concessions and increased
investment, but is also a stepping stone to Taiwan's entry into regional trade
blocs.</P>
      <P>The president said Johnson Health Tech Co., a maker of fitness equipment with a
global market, is a model of innovation and competitiveness.</P>
      <P>"One of its products, a portable treadmill that can be folded and stored under a
bed, is innovative and representative of Taiwan's competitiveness," the
president said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Representatives of the tourism industry in Kaohsiung and Pingtung are scheduled
to meet with a top tourism official from China Monday as part of efforts to
attract more Chinese visitors to the southern part of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lin Fu-nan, head of the Kao-Kao-Ping Tourism Alliance, a union of tourism-
related industries in the Kaohsiung and Pingtung areas, said the alliance will
discuss Monday with Shao Qiwei, director of China's National Tourism
Administration and head of the Cross-Strait Tourism Association (CSTA) , ways of
bringing more Chinese tourists to the area.</P>
      <P>The southern areas of Taiwan traditionally have been a stronghold of the
opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which advocates Taiwan's de jure
independence.</P>
      <P>Lin said that Kaohsiung City tourism has suffered greatly due to a sharp
decrease in the number of Chinese tourist arrivals since a visit last year by
the Dalai Lama, who is viewed by China as a separatist.</P>
      <P>The Kaohsiung City government invited the Tibetan spiritual leader to visit
Taiwan last year to pray for victims of Typhoon Morakot after the storm caused
massive destruction in the south of the country last August.</P>
      <P>In September, the city government screened a documentary about exiled Uighur
political activist Rebiya Kadeer, another figure who is seen by China as a
separatist.</P>
      <P>Lin said that thanks to the efforts of tourism operators who sought to establish
communication  with the relevant  Chinese authorities, tourist arrivals from
China have returned to "normal levels."</P>
      <P>He expressed the hope that "no other government agencies or officials would take
similar actions or make remarks" that would be detrimental to the tourism or
other industries.</P>
      <P>Lin said that Kaohsiung City saw the number of its tourist arrivals so far this
year increased by 108 percent from the same period of 2009, and by 168 percent
from 2008.</P>
      <P>"With 45 percent of the visitors to Kaohsiung City being Chinese tourists, many
tourism operators in the area see Chinese visitor arrivals as 'a shot in arm'
for the sector, " Lin said.</P>
      <P>The operators have planned new tour packages and are hoping that the meeting
with Shao will yield positive results, he said.</P>
      <P>Shao, who is in Taiwan for a cross-strait trade fair, said a few days ago that
Chinese visitor arrivals to Taiwan will reach 1.5 million this year, and will
later rise to 3 million.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan Power Company (Taipower) said Sunday that a power-saving drive it
launched in July has proved successful, in both terms of cutting energy
consumption and reducing emissions of carbon dioxide.</P>
      <P>Under the drive that was launched July 1 in response to a government call for
energy saving and carbon reduction measures, a total of 8.1 billion kilowatts-
hours (kwhs) were saved in the month of July nationwide, Taipower said.</P>
      <P>This represents a drop of 5.18 million metric tons of greenhouse gases,
according to the state-run company.</P>
      <P>The 8.1 billion kwhs of electricity saved was more than than the total 7.5
billion kwhs consumed by all households in Taipei City for the entire year of
2009, Taipower said.</P>
      <P>Taipower attributed the success of its efforts mainly to the discount incentives
that it offered to general households, junior high schools and elementary
schools nationwide.</P>
      <P>These users were given discounts of 5 percent to 20 percent on their bills, once
they showed reduced power consumption or at least no increase, Taipower said.</P>
      <P>"The more power you save, the more money you will save with Taipower," the
company said.</P>

      <P>A vote will be held at an informal legislative  meeting  Monday to decide  on
the agenda for an extraordinary session scheduled for this week, a ruling
Kuomintang (KMT) legislator said Sunday.</P>
      <P>"As the ruling and opposition parties failed in consultations Friday to come to
terms on the agenda for the extra legislative session, a vote will have to be
called to settle the issue, " said Legislator Lin Yi-shih who heads the KMT's
Policy Coordination Committee.</P>
      <P>Legislative  Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng invited ruling and opposition
legislative whips Friday to discuss the details of an extra session to screen a
recently signed trade pact with China and several other critical bills.</P>
      <P>The only agreement the two sides reached in the meeting was that the extra
session  will last two weeks and that an informal legislative plenary meeting
will be held Monday to flesh out the session's agenda.</P>
      <P>The session will be the second of its kind since the ruling party-controlled
legislature went into summer recess.</P>
      <P>The KMT legislative caucus has proposed an agenda that would include
ratification of the economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) with China
and five other bills that will pave the way for implemention of the trade deal.</P>
      <P>The five ECFA-related bills are an intellectual property rights protection
agreement with China as well as amendments to the current trademark law, patent
law, and regulations on customs duties and plant registration.</P>
      <P>Also high on the KMT's priority list are three law amendments to allow  the
admission  of Chinese  students  to local tertiary institutions.</P>
      <P>The KMT is also hoping to review draft revisions to the National Health
Insurance program to smooth the way for the introduction of a second-generation
health insurance program. Also on its agenda are amendments to the Public
Officials Election and Recall Law to prevent any rezoning of legislative
constituencies for the next 10 years.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lin said, the KMT wants to amend the regulations governing
retirement  benefits to former presidents  and vice presidents as well as the
tobacco and alcohol taxation act.</P>
      <P>However, the legislative caucus of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) has questioned the propriety of dealing with these bills in an extra
session.</P>
      <P>Ker Chien-ming,  the DPP's top legislative  whip,  said a provisional session
should only deal with urgent bills, while those that will have an impact on the
national well-being or popular interests should be addressed in regular
sessions.</P>
      <P>"Our stance is that only the ECFA should be screened in the upcoming special
session, and its supplementary bills should be examined in the next regular
session," Ker said.</P>
      <P>The DPP will submit only one bill during the special session, and that is for a
referendum on the ECFA, he said.</P>
      <P>The DPP has insisted that ECFA be subject to a line-item review, Lin said, but
the ruling and opposition legislative caucuses might discuss the technical
details after Monday's informal plenary meeting.</P>

      <P>A children's choir from Uganda began its six-city concert tour of Taiwan Sunday
with a performance in the southern port city of Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>Before the concert, members of the Watoto choir attended a promotional event in
the city's bustling commercial district to invite city residents to their
evening performance.</P>
      <P>They also visited a bakery where they tried making dough and baking, and they
later toured several educational and cultural institutions.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung was the first stop on the choir's tour of Taiwan. The choir will give
a total of eight performances in six cities around Taiwan from Aug. 15-30 to
raise funds for disadvantaged children in developing countries, according to
World Vision Taiwan, a Christian charity that organized the tour.</P>
      <P>The Watoto choir, which arrived in Taiwan Wednesday, will hold its other
concerts in Chiayi, Taichung, Hsinchu, Taipei and Hualien.</P>
      <P>"We hope to raise people's awareness of and generate support for orphaned
children around the world," World Vision said in a statement.</P>
      <P>The choir, which was formed in 1994, is composed of children aged 7-15 who have
lost their parents in civil conflicts or to AIDS.</P>
      <P>The choir members are from Watoto Children's Village in Uganda, which was
founded in 1992 by Canadian missionaries Gary and Marilyn Skinner to care for
such children.</P>
      <P>At the concerts, the Watoto children will sing a Taiwanese song that they have
been practicing for a month, said Hank Du, the national director of World Vision

      <P>Tickets to the concerts are NT$500 each and the proceeds will go toward Watoto's
work in Uganda and World Vision's HOPE Initiative which supports children
affected by HIV and AIDS, the charity said.</P>
      <P>Some of the funds will also be used to help children living in extremely
difficult circumstances, such as street children in India and disabled children

      <P>Taiwan Legislator Kao Chin Su-mei called on Japan Prime Minister Naoto Kan
Sunday to apologize to the Asian countries that fell victim to Japan's
aggression in World War II.</P>
      <P>Kao Chin, who attended a ceremony in Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, to mark the 65th
anniversary of Japan's surrender to the allied nations, said that Kan should
apologize for Japan's colonial rule of Taiwan, for its aggression against China,
and to other Asian countries.</P>
      <P>Kao Chin took the spotlight in August last year when she led a group of Taiwan
aboriginals to protest in Tokyo against the inclusion of Taiwan aboriginal
soldiers in Yasukuni Shrine, which is dedicated to Japan's war dead.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan aboriginals died in World War II fighting for Japan. Kao Chin argued
that the aboriginal soldiers were forced to serve in the Imperial Japanese army
when Taiwan was under Japan's colonial rule 1895-1945.</P>
      <P>Kao Chin denied that she is hostile toward Japan and that her campaign would
undermine Taiwan's ties with Japan.</P>
      <P>"Our protest in Tokyo was supported and aided by many Japanese human right
activists who are ashamed of their government's refusal to apologize for Japan's
aggression in the past," she said.</P>
      <P>"Only by facing history honestly can we usher in a brighter future," the Taiwan

    <TEXT>
      <P>A children's choir from Uganda began its six-city concert tour of Taiwan Sunday
with a performance in the southern port city of Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>Before the concert, members of the Watoto choir attended a promotional event in
the city's bustling commercial district to invite city residents to their
evening performance.</P>
      <P>They also visited a bakery where they tried making dough and baking, and they
later toured several educational and cultural institutions.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung was the first stop on the choir's tour of Taiwan. The choir will give
a total of eight performances in six cities around Taiwan from Aug. 15-30 to
raise funds for disadvantaged children in developing countries, according to
World Vision Taiwan, a Christian charity that organized the tour.</P>
      <P>The Watoto choir, which arrived in Taiwan Wednesday, will hold its other
concerts in Chiayi, Taichung, Hsinchu, Taipei and Hualien.</P>
      <P>"We hope to raise people's awareness of and generate support for orphaned
children around the world," World Vision said in a statement.</P>
      <P>The choir, which was formed in 1994, is composed of children aged 7-15 who have
lost their parents in civil conflicts or to AIDS.</P>
      <P>The choir members are from Watoto Children's Village in Uganda, which was
founded in 1992 by Canadian missionaries Gary and Marilyn Skinner to care for
such children.</P>
      <P>At the concerts, the Watoto children will sing a Taiwanese song that they have
been practicing for a month, said Hank Du, the national director of World Vision
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He urged the public to not only donate money to the cause, but also "come listen
to the beautiful voices of the children."</P>
      <P>Tickets to the concerts are NT$500 each and the proceeds will go toward Watoto's
work in Uganda and World Vision's HOPE Initiative which supports children
affected by HIV and AIDS, the charity said.</P>
      <P>Some of the funds will also be used to help children living in extremely
difficult circumstances, such as street children in India and disabled children
in China.</P>
      <P>This is the third time that World Vision has invited Watoto to perform in
Taiwan.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan Legislator Kao Chin Su-mei called on Japan Prime Minister Naoto Kan
Sunday to apologize to the Asian countries that fell victim to Japan's
aggression in World War II.</P>
      <P>Kao Chin, who attended a ceremony in Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, to mark the 65th
anniversary of Japan's surrender to the allied nations, said that Kan should
apologize for Japan's colonial rule of Taiwan, for its aggression against China,
and to other Asian countries.</P>
      <P>Kao Chin took the spotlight in August last year when she led a group of Taiwan
aboriginals to protest in Tokyo against the inclusion of Taiwan aboriginal
soldiers in Yasukuni Shrine, which is dedicated to Japan's war dead.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan aboriginals died in World War II fighting for Japan. Kao Chin argued
that the aboriginal soldiers were forced to serve in the Imperial Japanese army
when Taiwan was under Japan's colonial rule 1895-1945.</P>
      <P>Kao Chin denied that she is hostile toward Japan and that her campaign would
undermine Taiwan's ties with Japan.</P>
      <P>"Our protest in Tokyo was supported and aided by many Japanese human right
activists who are ashamed of their government's refusal to apologize for Japan's
aggression in the past," she said.</P>
      <P>"Only by facing history honestly can we usher in a brighter future," the Taiwan
lawmaker said.</P>
      <P>After the ceremony in Nanjing, Kao Chin was quoted in the Chinese media as
saying that history could be forgiven but should not be forgotten and that her
campaign to have the names of Taiwan aboriginals removed from Yasukuni Shrine is
part of her efforts to show history as it is.</P>

    <HEADLINE>United Daily News: Danger of unbalanced financial structure</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>08/16/10  10:29:54
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The 2008-2009 global financial crunch not only battered Taiwan's economy but
also exposed the vulnerability of its public finances.</P>
      <P>Tax revenue is known to form the bedrock of a country's financial health. The
higher the ratio of tax revenue in government spending, the healthier the
country's finances. In Taiwan, however, the ratio fell below the alarming level
of 60 percent to a record low of 59 percent last year.</P>
      <P>The taxation woes could be attributed partly to the global financial disaster,
but "human error" should take even greater blame for the plight.</P>
      <P>For years, the government has lacked the mettle to engage in sweeping tax
reform, turning a blind eye to flaws and imbalances in our taxation structure.</P>
      <P>At the turn of the century, the government promised to balance the budget in 10
years. The vow has turned out to be empty talk because the government still has
to rely on borrowing to stay afloat. More ironic is that debt is expected to
account for a record high 13 percent of its total expenditure this year.</P>
      <P>Given its financial fragility, the government cannot afford to sit on its hands
any more. The decline in the ratio of tax revenue in government spending mainly
stems from erosion of the tax base. As starters of a badly needed financial
reform, action should be taken to expand that base.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the government should create more income sources based on the "users
pay" concept or by collaborating with private groups to better utilize its huge
real estate holdings. (Editorial abstract -- Aug. 16, 2010).</P>

      <P>Liuho Night Market in the southern Taiwan port city of Kaohsiung has won the top
spot in all six categories of competition in an online poll on Taiwan's best
night markets, the Tourism Bureau said Monday.</P>
      <P>As of Sunday at midnight, Liuho had been voted the most environmentally
friendly, most visitor-friendly, most interesting, easiest to shop at, most
popular and best for food, the bureau said.</P>
      <P>With night markets emerging as a "must-visit" tourist attraction for vacationers
to Taiwan, the Tourism Bureau has made them a major theme of its tourism
promotion for 2010.</P>
      <P>The "most special night market" competition is part of the promotional campaign.
In the first stage of competition, 10 major night markets were selected by
travel agents and tourist industry executives. The top 10 were then put to an
online poll that began July 20 and ended at midnight Aug. 15.</P>
      <P>Taipei's Shilin Night Market emerged as the first runner-up in all six
categories of competition, and Luodong Night Market in Yilan County won third
place in all the categories.</P>
      <P>On criticism about the fairness or credibility of the online voting, tourism
officials said the results of the first-stage competition and the online voting
accounted for 20 percent each in the race.</P>
      <P>The final stage of competition, which will be evaluated by a panel of seven
experts in food, tourism and other related fields through unannounced spot
surveys, will account for 60 percent of the final scores, the officials said,
adding that the results will be announced Aug. 25.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Major vacation resorts around Taiwan, particularly seashore areas and lakeside
spots, have been flooded with holidaymakers this summer, thanks to an absence of
typhoons and less rainfall than usual.</P>
      <P>Many mountain  resorts,  however,  are still reeling  from devastation wrought
by Typhoon Morakot, which battered Taiwan last August. As major mountain roads
leading to those regions are fragile or unstable, the number of tourist arrivals
at Alishan, Guguan and Maolin remains limited a year after the disaster.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from local media coverage of the developments:</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>Sun Moon Lake has emerged as the most popular tourist attraction, with the
number of tourist arrivals totaling 4 million in the first seven months of the
year, a figure that already exceeded the total for the whole of last year,
according to statistics compiled by the Sun Moon Lake National Scenic Area
Administration.</P>
      <P>Of the figure, 700,000 were Chinese visitors, surpassing the 500,000 Chinese
tourists to the lake recorded in all of 2009, said Tseng Kuo-chi, director of
the Sun Moon Lake administration office. Major hotels in the area have seen
occupancy rates grow by 10 percent to 20 percent from the year-earlier levels,
Tseng added.</P>
      <P>The number of visitors to Kenting on the southern tip of Taiwan as well as the
those to the islands of Liouciou and Green Island have also hit new records.
Private bed and breakfast owners and cabin operators in the Kenting resort area
said they have been so busy this summer that they don't have time to read
newspapers or talk on cell phones.</P>
      <P>The nearby National Museum of Marine Biology and Aquarium has been receiving
more than 7,000 visitors a day since the beginning of summer vacation, a
conspicuous contrast to the several hundred recorded in the few months after the
Morakot disaster.</P>
      <P>In comparison, the number of tourists to Alishan was only 40 percent of its pre-
typhoon figure as the main line of its alpine railway has not resumed operation,
local travel service providers said.</P>
      <P>The number of visitors to spa resorts in mountainous regions in the hardest-hit
Pingtung and Kaohsiung counties also remained limited, with Maolin attracting
only 6,000 visitors in June, less than 10 percent of the number posted in the
same month last year. (Aug. 16, 2010).</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC) will sponsor a food
festival at Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport -- Taiwan's main gateway -- in
the near future in an attempt to shed its reputation for offering bad food at
expensive prices.</P>
      <P>MOTC Minister Mao Chih-kuo said existing and would-be restaurant and beverage
shop operators at the airport will be invited to demonstrate their culinary arts
and present gourmet dishes at the festival.</P>
      <P>Food sold at the Taoyuan airport has long been criticized as costly yet
unpalatable. Mao said his ministry has invited noted local gourmet food
providers to open stores at the airport after the airport administration is
transformed into a corporation in November.</P>
      <P>The soon-to-be-held food festival will be a warm-up event to mark the airport's
management reform, Mao said, adding that in the future, the airport will sponsor
a food festival quarterly or biannually in an effort to upgrade service quality.

the county, said it had for the most part attained its goals.</P>
      <P>The event was suspended for two years under the previous magistrate. Current

      <P>Minister of Economic Affairs Shih Yen-shiang plans to visit Indonesia at the end
of September to survey opportunities for trade and investment in the textile,
food and machinery sectors, government sources said Monday.</P>
      <P>As Indonesia has built better relations with China, Shih is expected to use the
visit to break the ice, hoping to improve bilateral ties with the Southeast
Asian country, according to Ministry of Economic Affairs officials.</P>
      <P>The officials said Shih is likely to lead a delegation to visit Indonesia on
Sept. 29 if the country's economics authorities will treat the Taiwanese
delegation on an equal-footing basis and launch a ministerial-level welcome for
the Taiwanese delegation.</P>
      <P>If Shih is informed that he cannot enjoy equal treatment in Indonesia, the
ministry said the Taiwanese delegation will be led by a vice minister of
economics affairs.</P>
      <P>The ministry plans to organize an investment surveying group for the visit,
while four trade promotion groups from Taiwan will join the delegation.</P>
      <P>Apart from representatives from the textile, food and machinery sectors, state-
owned enterprises such as Taiwan Sugar Corp., oil firm CPC Corp., Taiwan,  and
Taiwan Power Co. are expected to be represented in the delegation, the officials
said, adding that Indonesia has expressed hopes that Taiwan Sugar will invest in
the country to expand sugar production and meet demand.</P>
      <P>The officials said 18 Taiwanese firms including garment maker TEXMA
International Co., Ltd. have signed up for the visit.</P>
      <P>Earlier this month, the ministry said it had targeted Indonesia and Vietnam as
potential free trade agreement (FTA) partners after Taiwan announced it had
agreed with to enter negotiations on a bilateral trade pact with Singapore.</P>
      <P>The ministry officials said that after Taiwan and China signed the economic
cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) in late June, the island is gearing up to
boost business ties with Southeast Asian countries to penetrate the huge
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) market.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is the 10th largest foreign investor in Indonesia, focusing on textiles,
furniture, footwear, mineral resources and metals, while Taiwanese investors
have also been engaged in the services and agriculture sectors there.</P>
      <P>The officials said the ministry is aimed at helping old economy companies in
Taiwan to relocate their investments in Southeast Asia, with Indonesia one of

    <TEXT>
      <P>has long been constrained by its pro-independence and China-hostile ideology and
likes to brand those who hold different political views as "traitors of Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung County Magistrate Yang Chiu-hsing is the latest victim of the DPP's
name-calling strategy. DPP hardliners do not hesitate to accuse Yang of selling
out Taiwan after he announced his candidacy in the November mayoral election
without the party's endorsement, nor have they accepted his decision to
conditionally support a newly signed trade pact with China.</P>
      <P>In the face of China's rise as a new economic powerhouse, the DPP should think
twice before pointing fingers. Under the current Kuomintang modus vivendi
approach, relations across the Taiwan Strait are moving toward reconciliation
and co-prosperity. Public opinion polls also show solid support  for the cross-
strait  economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA).</P>
      <P>If the DPP continues its anti-ECFA rhetoric, it may find itself losing the
opportunity to stage a comeback. At a time when the DPP is charting a new
platform to guide its development over the next decade, it should bravely shed
its prejudiced way of thinking and work out new strategies with visionary
broadmindedness that will bring new hope to Taiwan. (Editorial abstract -- Aug.

    <HEADLINE>Economic Daily News: Adapting to new global economic model</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>08/16/10  14:17:00
(By Y.L. Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A few weeks ago, the global economy seemed to emerge from the shadow of Europe's
debt crisis as global stocks rallied and Asian shares surged to record highs.
But last week, major stock markets around the world were generally lower due to
uncertainty over the global economic outlook.</P>
      <P>This indicates that short-term economic fluctuations have become a major part of
the new economic model following the 2008-2009 global financial crisis and could
cause difficulty for businesses when making decisions concerning investment and
operations  and for government when formulating policy.</P>
      <P>For Taiwan, the new normal economic model is definitely a stiff challenge for
its heavily export-reliant economy.</P>
      <P>If Taiwan is to adapt and remain firm in the volatile global economic
environment, it should adopt the following strategies:</P>
      <P>First, adopt open trade policies to inject new momentum into economic growth.
The economic cooperation framework cooperation recently signed between Taiwan
and China can be seen as a big step forward toward the establishment of a free
trade area in the region.</P>
      <P>The government should also start negotiations with China on reaching agreements
on trade in products,  trade in services investment guarantees and the
establishment of a dispute resolution mechanism.</P>
      <P>It should also quicken its pace of inking trade agreements with Singapore and
its other major trade partners.</P>
      <P>Second, fully improve efficiency of the supply chain to drive economic growth.
To this end, the government should put more efforts into promoting innovation
and talent cultivation, and speeding up the adjustment of the country's
industrial structure.</P>
      <P>Third, strengthen the government's risk-bearing capacity. Under the new economic
model, economic uncertainty will increase. Therefore, the government should work
to increase its risk-bearing ability and endurance.</P>
      <P>Finally, upgrade the government's competitiveness. Singapore's brilliant
economic performance lies in its government's resolution and governance. If
Taiwan's government wants to catch up with the city-state, it should improve its
governance. (Editorial abstract -- Aug. 16, 2010).</P>

      <P>Taiwan share prices closed up 0.62 percent Monday as rotational buying boosted
small and medium cap stocks and select financial firms to reverse early losses
on Wall Street's weakness at the end of last week, dealers said.</P>
      <P>The weighted index rose 49.64 points to 7,941.22 after moving between 7,850.56
and 7,941.22 on turnover of NT$119.43 billion (US$3.74 billion).</P>
      <P>The market opened down 0.09 percent and moved to a low in early trade on falling
U.S. markets as investors became more cautious about the earnings outlook of the
electronics sector for the second half of this year, dealers said.</P>
      <P>However, select financial stocks on low valuations attracted bargain hunting and
turned stronger in late trade, helping the broader market get out of the earlier
slump, they said.</P>
      <P>A total of 1,825 stocks closed up and 1,783 down with 307 stocks remaining
unchanged.</P>
      <P>The textile sector scored the highest gains, up 2.8 percent. Foodstuffs rose 1.0
percent, paper and pulp stocks added 0.6 percent, and machinery and electronics
stocks gained 0.5 percent.</P>
      <P>The financial and the plastics and chemical sectors closed up 0.4 percent each,
while the construction sector closed unchanged and the cement sector fell 0.2
percent.</P>
      <P>The local market moved in a narrow range without aggressive buying by foreign
institutional investors, TLG Asset Management analyst Arch Shih said.</P>
      <P>"Many foreign institutional investors took to the sidelines, holding a wait-and-
see attitude toward the earnings outlook of local high-tech heavyweights as
there have been signs of falling global demand," Shih said.</P>
      <P>Shih said that although China's economic fundamentals remain sound -- lending
support to the global economy -- Taiwan's high-tech sector still depends on the
United States and Europe for consumption.</P>
      <P>"Uncertainty over the U.S. and European economies is expected to continue to
haunt the local bourse and lower the willingness to chase share prices even if
the index stages a rebound," Shih said.</P>
      <P>Shih said the local bourse witnessed active rotational buying in non-electronics
stocks Monday, while the buying avoided large cap high-tech shares.</P>
      <P>"Select financial stocks received a boost by renewed high hopes for increasing
cross-strait exchanges, " Shih said."If the financial sector extends gains, the
broader market may not suffer heavy losses despite a slower electronics sector."</P>
      <P>En Tie Commercial Bank added 4.39 percent to NT$16.65, Chang Hwa Bank gained
3.49 percent to NT$19.30 and Fubon Financial rose 1.33 percent to NT38.00.</P>
      <P>Among high-tech heavyweights, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. closed up
0.33 percent at NT$60.30, while United Microelectronics Corp. fell 0.71 percent

    <TEXT>
      <P>About 50 pro-independence groups started a two-day sit-in protest Monday in
front of the Legislative Yuan, calling for a referendum on a cross-Taiwan Strait
trade pact and a transparent review of the pact at an extraordinary legislative
session slated for Aug. 17-30.</P>
      <P>The protesters, led by the opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) and the
Taiwan Nation Alliance (TNA) expressed their opposition to the economic
cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) signed by Taiwan and China in late June
and demanded an ECFA referendum during the sit-in, held on the same day that an
informal legislative meeting was held to decide on the agenda for the
extraordinary session.</P>
      <P>TSU Chairman Huang Kun-huei, the protest organizer, accused the government of
rejecting the Taiwanese people's right to referendum, saying that if it is true
that the ECFA will bring across-the-board benefits to Taiwan as touted by the
government, the government should keep his hands off and allow the people to
determine whether the trade pact should have been signed.</P>
      <P>Huang also said that the signing of the ECFA has tied the two economies together
and could be seen as a prelude to eventual unification with China.</P>
      <P>The government's Referendum Review Committee has twice rejected the TSU's ECFA
referendum proposal.</P>
      <P>He said the party will not halt its push for an ECFA referendum and that it will
initiate a proposal to disband the review committee.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lo Rong-kuang, a minister of the Taiwan Presbyterian Church, said
that China is a politics-led regime, that all the economic  and cultural
activities  it promotes  have political intentions and that its eventual goal is
to annex Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Despite the situation,  the administration of President Ma Ying-jeou has chosen
to dance to Beijing's tune and is willing to take the political risk of tying
Taiwan economically to China, which could make Taiwan locked into China, Lo
added.</P>
      <P>Yao Chia-wen, the head of the TNA, also said that the groups plan to continue
the sit-in until the ECFA review is completed.</P>

    <HEADLINE>65 years after WWII, Taiwanese veterans hope to be recognized</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>08/16/10  16:33:01</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Distant memories of the Pacific War and the deaths of fellow child-workers and
comrades still bring tears to the eyes of Lee Hsueh-feng and Lin Teh-hwa, two of
more than 200,000 Taiwanese directly involved in World War II.</P>
      <P>At around the time of the 65th anniversary of Hiroshima and Nagasaki atomic
bombings that led to the end of the World War II, there are still no formal
ceremonies in Taiwan or memorials erected to commemorate former military men
like Lee and Lin.</P>
      <P>This is why they appeared at the War Memorial Park located in the southern port
city of Kaohsiung, an important military and industrial center during the
Japanese colonial era from 1895-1945, and called for the government to pay due
respect to Taiwan's World War II veterans.</P>
      <P>"Maybe it (the lack of recognition) is because we were seen as Japanese, which
we really were at the time, " said 85-year-old Lin, who joined the Japanese
Imperial Navy in 1943 at 17 as a volunteer because soldiers' families received
special benefits.</P>
      <P>Lin, who hails from central Taiwan, said he made the decision because "I had
four older brothers. And at 17, I feared nothing, including death." He was
fortunate to stay in Taiwan as a naval driver instead of being sent to the South
Pacific theater, but said that "serving in the Japanese military was living
hell," nonetheless.</P>
      <P>Lee, on the other hand, went to Yamato City in Japan's Kanagawa Prefecture that
same year, in the first group of Taiwanese child workers, called "shonenko" who
answered a call from the Japanese government to build fighter planes. In all,
more than 8,000 boys aged 12-14 left their families, homeland and childhood with
the promise of an education in Japan. However, the promises and their dreams
were never fulfilled.</P>
      <P>In December 1944, 25 Taiwanese boys were killed in a United States' air raid on
Nagoya. Lee, at 17, was the oldest of the group, and assumed the responsibility
of taking care of his "brothers, " who often got homesick and cried at night.</P>
      <P>"We had a very hard time (in Japan) but we were a happy group of kids. Losing
them (the 25 boys) just broke my heart, " Lee recalled, adding that 300 of them
never returned to Taiwan after the war.</P>
      <P>Those 25 boys, along with 30,304 Taiwanese soldiers killed in the war, including
former Taiwanese President Lee Teng-hui's older brother, are still remembered at
Tokyo's Yasukuni Shrine and have never officially returned to their homeland
either, Lee lamented.</P>
      <P>Lee said he often wonders  how he was able to tell his grandchildren that
"grandpa built fighter planes for the Japanese Imperial Air Force at your age"
in a time when most university students in Taiwan have little understanding of
Taiwan's history and when some of them even think it was Japan rather than the
United States, that bombed Taiwan in war.</P>
      <P>Liang Chih-hsiang, 82, was one of the very few who fought as a Japanese soldier
in the South Pacific before being recruited and sent to China by the Kuomintang
(KMT) government to combat the troops of the Communist Party of China.</P>
      <P>Yang Liao Shu-hsia, 83, was a 16-year-old student in the Japanese territory in
Shanghai when the war in the Pacific broke out. She volunteered to be trained
and serve as a military nurse and was not able to return to Taiwan until 1947.</P>
      <P>Stories like these could go on and on. Those who were involved in the war are
now in their 80s and, as Lee puts it, will be "naturally fading away" soon.</P>
      <P>There should be a memorial in Taiwan like the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Wall in
Washington, which lists the names of those who died and those who remain
unaccounted for in the Vietnam War, because the war experience is a collective
memory of millions of people, said Jiang Chung-hwa, chairman of the Taiwan
Extra-Patriot Veterans Association (TEPVA).</P>
      <P>The association is seeking collaboration from dozens of civic organizations, as
well as donations from the public, to establish a memorial park where a monument
can be erected and ceremonies can be held annually for the families of the World
War II Taiwanese soldiers and service members to commemorate their loved ones.</P>
      <P>"There has been so little commemoration of the war in Taiwan in which millions
of people were directly or indirectly involved. This is a strange  society, "
said TEPVA Secretary-General  Chuang Sheng-huang.</P>
      <P>Citing statistics from Japan's Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare, Chuang
said that around 8,000 Taiwanese soldiers and more than 120,000 other service
personnel were involved in the Pacific War, 15,000 of whom are listed as missing
in action.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's society today is known for its diversification, but the same goes for
Taiwanese society in the 1940's, according to Chuang. "Some of the soldiers
volunteered, while some were forced to fight for Japan. Some thought of
themselves as Taiwanese while others regarded themselves as Japanese," he said.</P>
      <P>"There were even some Taiwanese who volunteered to fight for the KMT in the
Chinese civil war," he added.</P>
      <P>"Irrespective of the political ideology, the war memories and humanity are the
same then and now. What we're trying to do is to reveal history and let history
speak for itself," he said. By Chris Wang CNA Staff Reporter</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>An animal rights group on Monday called for the immediate seizure of two newborn
ligers -- a hybrid of a tiger and lion -- from a private zoo in Tainan County,
saying the operator should be severely punished for illegally  cross-breeding
two different species of protected animals.</P>
      <P>Environmental and Animal Society of Taiwan (EAST) said Huang Kuo-nan, the owner
of an educational farm, violated the Wildlife Conservation Law by allowing two
types of protected animals to mate.</P>
      <P>The group is urging the government to mete out harsh punishment on Huang, known
as the "snake king, " to deter others from copying the behavior.</P>
      <P>On Sunday, a six year-old tigress gave birth to three ligers but only two
survived, according to Huang.</P>
      <P>Kuo Yi-pin, the head of the Tainan County Government Agricultural Department,
said tigers and lions are protected  animals and therefore, it is illegal to
artificially cross-breed the two.</P>
      <P>The county officials are scheduled to visit the farm and will slap Huang with a
NT$50,000 fine and confiscate the cubs if any legal discrepancies are found, he
said.</P>
      <P>"Cross-breeding two protected species is completely against nature. We are
urging the Council of Agriculture (COA) to seize the two cubs immediately and
bring Huang to real justice. A fine of NT$50,000 is a mere slap on the wrist, "
said Lin Tai-jing, an EAST researcher.</P>
      <P>Lin said a light fine of NT$50,000 is "too little to pay to legalize an illegal
behavior."</P>
      <P>"It is like paying the government for a permit to breed ligers, " she argued.</P>
      <P>Huang, however, said he did not artificially breed the animals but admitted he
has kept a male lion and a tigress in the same space for the last few years,
dubbing the two "childhood lovers" and describing the births of the cubs as an
"accident."</P>
      <P>Earlier this month, Huang was the target for animal welfare advocates when he
was accused of selling live tigers and bears as well as tiger bones and bear
paws -- both believed to have medicinal properties.</P>
      <P>Huang has cried foul over the accusations, saying he runs a legitimate business.
Huang was a member of the COA's wildlife conservation  panel from 1995 to 2000
and is currently under investigation for the illegal trade of endangered
species.</P>

      <P>U.S. Senator Arlen Specter, a democrat from Pennsylvania, paid a courtesy call
on the Legislative Yuan Monday to learn about the impact Taiwan's trade pact
with China will have on its ties with Beijing.</P>
      <P>Legislative Speaker Wang Jin-pyng talked with Specter for an hour on the
sideline of an informal gathering of lawmakers of various parties to discuss the
agenda of a special legislative session scheduled to open the following day.</P>
      <P>Wang told journalists after the meeting that Specter is the first U.S. senator
to have visited the Legislative Yuan for the last two or three years.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lin Yu-fang, who accompanied Wang during the meeting, said Specter
was interested in the ramifications that Taiwan's economic cooperation framework
agreement with China will have on ties across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Specter,  whose  home  state  of Pennsylvania  has imposed anti-dumping duties
on tires imported from China, was reported to want to know how Taiwan's trade
with China is proceeding.</P>
      <P>Lin quoted Wang as briefing Specter on the historical background of the
political disputes between Taiwan and China, the long way the two sides have
come in their ties, and the long way the two sides are expected to go before
they can come to terms with each other politically.</P>
      <P>The speaker was reported as telling Specter that Taiwanese products face intense
competition from similar products from China, especially towels.</P>
      <P>The reason is more the cheap labor costs in China than Chinese dumping, and the
Taiwanese authorities have had to resort to heavier tariffs to protect local
towel producers, Wang was quoted as saying.</P>
      <P>Specter, who had just concluded a visit to Vietnam, complained about what he
called China's assertiveness over disputed islands in the South China Sea.</P>
      <P>But he was supportive when he learned from Wang that Taiwan has staked out
territorial claims to these islands too and has deployed armed forces on several
of the disputed territories, according to Lin.</P>
      <P>Lin said Specter also compared notes with Wang on Taiwan's requests to buy arms
from the U.S.</P>

      <P>Pegatron Corp., a manufacturing arm of personal computer vendor AsusTek Computer
Inc., said Monday it was still investigating accusations that an Apple manager
coached its unit in China on how to bid for contracts.</P>
      <P>A U.S. federal grand jury indicted Paul Devine, an Apple global supply manager,
for allegedly taking at least US$1 million in kickbacks from six Apple suppliers
in Asia.</P>
      <P>According  to the indictment  document released last week, China-based Kaedar
Electronics Co.,  which is wholly owned by Pegatron, was among six Asian firms
that received confidential information from Devine to help it negotiate
favorable terms in supply contracts with Apple between 2005 and 2008.</P>
      <P>The others accused include Cresyn Co. Ltd. in South Korea and Jin Li Mould
Manufacturing Pte. Ltd in Singapore.</P>
      <P>Pegatron spokesman Lin Chiu-tan said his company was still checking on the
accusations and pointed out that Pegatron did not own Kaedar until 2008.</P>
      <P>He said Pegatron  needed  time to better  understand  the allegations.</P>
      <P>Kaedar is a computer component manufacturer and also makes casings for iPods.</P>
      <P>The Wall Street Journal had previously reported Pegatron was working on iPhones
based on the code division multiple access (CDMA) mobile standard for Apple.</P>
      <P>When asked whether Pegatron's business ties with Apple could be affected by the
kickback scandal, Lin said he did not think so.</P>
      <P>Pegatron shares fell when the stock market opened after the scandal surfaced,
with institutional investors dumping the stock on fears that orders from Apple
would be cut, analysts said.</P>
      <P>Pegatron closed down 4.26 percent at NT$38.20 on the main board Monday.</P>
      <P>Pegatron was spun off by AsusTek in the first half of this year as AsusTek

bill reviewed at a special legislative session next week, the health minister
said Monday that if civic groups had their way, "30 years wouldn't be enough" to
complete the reform.</P>
      <P>The second-generation health insurance program is on the right course, Health
Minister Yaung Chih-liang said, "and what's right should be done."</P>
      <P>Yaung made the remarks while answering reporters on a request by civic
organizations, including the Consumers' Foundation and the National Health
Insurance Surveillance Alliance, to hold more public hearings on controversial
proposals to the reform plan before it is sent to the legislature for
ratification.</P>
      <P>Representatives of the civic groups rallied in front of the Legislative Yuan
earlier in the day, urging lawmakers not to hastily review draft revisions to
the National Health Insurance (NHI) program.</P>
      <P>They  said  26 of the  planned  articles  to govern  the second-generation
health insurance system were controversial.</P>
      <P>Pushing through the reform without resolving the controversial aspects first
would only make matters worse, they said.</P>
      <P>Part of the controversy focuses on a proposal to calculate premiums on the basis
of total household income rather than on the salaries of individuals.</P>
      <P>Consumers' Foundation Secretary-General Huang Yu-sheng has said that in most
cases, authorities will have no way to accurately determine the total income of
households.</P>
      <P>The campaigners also urged the government to first handle problems that have
been eroding the current system, such as doctors who prescribe useless
medications to bring money to the hospital.</P>
      <P>In response, Tai Kuei-ying, director-general of the Bureau of National Health
Insurance, said the Legislative Yuan's committee of health affairs has saved all
the controversial proposals for debates between ruling and opposition lawmakers.</P>
      <P>The bureau will respect the outcome of the talks, she said.</P>
      <P>At  present,  "the  most  important  thing  is  for  the second-generation
health insurance program to be placed on the agenda for the legislature," Tai
said.</P>
      <P>Only with debate can a "reasonable direction" for the reform be found, she
added.</P>

      <P>The Legislative Yuan decided at an informal session Monday to start a two-week
extraordinary  session the following day to screen a number of critical bills,
as well as a recently signed landmark trade pact with China.</P>
      <P>The ruling Kuomintang (KMT) -controlled legislature also held a vote to decide
that the agenda for the Aug. 17-30 extra session will include the cross-Taiwan
Strait economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) and five related bills.</P>
      <P>Opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) -proposed bills, including an ECFA
referendum initiative and a bill on amending the Act Governing Allocation of
Government Revenues and Expenditures, were blocked from the extra session
agenda.</P>
      <P>The session will be the second of its kind since the ruling party-controlled
legislature went into summer recess.</P>
      <P>During the first extra session held in July, the KMT steamrolled a motion to put
the ECFA directly to a second reading despite strong opposition from the DPP,
which called for a line-item review of the accord at the first reading.</P>
      <P>Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng said before the opening of Monday's
session that the ECFA will be screened article by article and will then be put
to a vote as a single package in the second reading.</P>
      <P>In addition to the ECFA, the five ECFA-related bills -- a cross-strait
intellectual property rights protection agreement, as well as amendments to the
current trademark law, patent law, and regulations on customs duties and plant
registration -- will also be screened during the second extra session.</P>
      <P>The agenda further includes three Ministry of Education-initiated packages of
legal amendments to pave the way for the admission of Chinese students to local
tertiary education institutions.</P>
      <P>Also to be addressed are draft revisions to the National Health Insurance
program to smooth the way for the introduction of a second-generation health
insurance system, as well as amendments to the Public Officials Election and
Recall Law to prevent any rezoning of legislative constituencies for the next 10
years.</P>
      <P>The session will also deal with draft amendments to regulations governing
retirement  benefits for former presidents  and vice presidents, as well as the
tobacco and alcohol taxation act.</P>

      <P>Seven electronics companies listed on Taiwan's over-the-counter (OTC) market
will attend a briefing for institutional investors in Tokyo on Aug. 23, the
first such briefing in Japan in four years, GreTai Securities Market (GTSM) said
Monday.</P>
      <P>According to GTSM, which operates Taiwan's OTC and emerging markets, Japanese
institutional investors are generally unfamiliar with companies traded on
Taiwan's OTC market because they view the market and its listed companies as too
small to be considered as investment targets.</P>
      <P>"We hope this ice-breaking trip to Japan will help change Japanese institutions'
impression and improve their understanding of Taiwan's OTC-listed companies,"
GTSM Chairman Gordon Chen said.</P>
      <P>The seven companies attending the briefing, organized jointly by GTSM and
Japan's Nomura Securities, are among the 50 most capitalized enterprises on the
OTC market.</P>
      <P>They are: solar cell manufacturer Motech Industries Inc., image sensor provider
PixArt Technologies Inc., nand flash manufacturer Phison Electronics Corp, IC
testing provider Chipbond Technology Corp, battery pack supplier Simplo
Technology Co., e-paper provider E Ink Holdings Inc.,  and wireless
communication device supplier Advanced Ceramic X Corp..</P>
      <P>A similar briefing will also take place in Hong Kong on Aug. 24.</P>
      <P>This will be the fourth consecutive year GTSM invites OTC blue chips to
participate in overseas investor briefings, with previous events held in London,
New York, Hong Kong and Singapore all receiving positive responses, Chen said.</P>
      <P>The GTSM chairman said that in MSCI's changes to its equity indices in May, 17
Taiwanese companies listed on the OTC or the emerging stock market were among
the 36 stocks from Taiwan added to the MSCI Global Small Cap indices.</P>

      <P>Kaohsiung Harbor has great potential for attracting tourists from China, the
president of the China-based Cross-Strait Tourism Exchange Association (CSTEA)
said in a meeting with representatives of the tourism industry in southen Taiwan
Monday.</P>
      <P>Vacationing is now gaining popularity in China. With Hong Kong portrayed as a
shopping heaven for tourists from China, Kaohsiung has great potential for
developing into a cruise vacation center, said Shao Qiwei, who also serves as
director of China's National Tourism Administration.</P>
      <P>Lin Fu-nan, president of the Kao-Kao-Ping Tourism Alliance, a union of tourism-
related industries in the Kaohsiung and Pingtung areas,  presented southern
Taiwan as an ideal destination for independent Chinese travelers, and promoted
more direct cross-strait transport and exchanges of tourism personnel in the
southern Taiwan area.</P>
      <P>Shao gave his assurance that the alliance's voice will be heard by the
authorities in Beijing.</P>
      <P>Unlike the existing country-wide group tours, future independent travelers from
China will be more likely to tour individual cities of their choice, according
to Shao.</P>
      <P>Details and regulations regarding the new travel options will be concluded in
future cross-strait negotiations, he added.</P>
      <P>With the number of Chinese visitors expected to hit 3 million this year, cross-
strait charter flights alone are not enough to meet demand, Shao said, adding
that an increase in sea transport is required.</P>
      <P>Responding to Shao's promise to introduce more Chinese travelers to Taiwan and
to Kaohsiung in particular, Lin said that southern Taiwan is fully prepared to
receive the increased number of tourists.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)  Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen said
Monday that the party is consistent in its stance that a recently signed cross-
Taiwan Strait trade pact should be reviewed article-by-article and that it will
submit a new draft of a government revenue allocation law during an
extraordinary legislative session slated to start the following day.</P>
      <P>Tsai made the comments at a DPP legislative caucus meeting before the
Legislative Yuan held an informal meeting to decide on the agenda for the
extraordinary session scheduled for Aug. 17-30.</P>
      <P>The DPP had originally planned to only raise a referendum proposal on the
economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) signed by Taiwan and China in
late June, but Tsai announced at the DPP meeting that the party will also
present a new draft of the Act Governing the Allocation of Government Revenues
and Expenditures at the extraordinary session.</P>
      <P>Tsai said that an additional NT$98 billion (US$3.07 billion) in subsidies was
originally planned for local governments, but an Executive Yuan version of the
act has sharply slashed the amount of subsidies to be available.</P>
      <P>For  example,  the  extra  annual  budget  for  the soon-to-be-established
municipality of Xinbei City has been cut by NT$18.9 billion, while that for the
upgraded Kaohsiung municipality has been slashed by NT$4 billion-NT$5 billion,
according to Tsai.</P>
      <P>She added that the DPP hopes its version will help inject the necessary funds to
the new special municipalities to be formed at the end of this year and bridge
the financial gap between Taipei City and the other local governments.</P>
      <P>Tsai said the DPP hopes the Legislative Yuan will soon complete a substantive
review of the act and urged the ruling Kuomintang to put it on the agenda for
the upcoming extraordinary session.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the KMT legislative caucus' insistence that the Legislative Yuan
should vote on the ECFA as a single package will cause clashes between the
ruling and opposition parties, Tsai said she will let the DPP caucus decide the
party's strategy for dealing with the ECFA topic during the session.</P>
      <P>As for whether the ECFA issue will have an impact on the year-end five special
municipality elections, Tsai said that if the KMT insists on rushing the bill
through, it could hurt its chances on election day.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Tainan County confiscates newborn ligers (update 1)</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Tainan County government on Monday afternoon confiscated newborn ligers --
hybrids of a tiger and a lion -- from a private zoo to be sheltered at a
research institute in Pingtung and said the zoo operator will be fined.</P>
      <P>Wu Hsing-hao, the chief of the Forest and Natural Conservation Section of the
Department of Agricultural, said the three one-day old cubs -- two alive and one
that died at birth -- will be kept at the National Pingtung University's
Institute of Wildlife Conservation.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the Wildlife Conservation Law, zoo operator Huang Kuo-nan,
known as "the snake king, " will face a fine of between NT$10,000 and NT$50,000
for breeding protected animals, Wu added.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, an animal rights group called for the immediate seizure of
the ligers, saying Huang should be severely punished for illegally cross-
breeding two species of protected animals.</P>
      <P>The Environmental and Animal Society of Taiwan (EAST) said Huang, who possesses
an array of wildlife, should be dealt with harshly to deter others from copying
the behavior.</P>
      <P>"Cross-breeding two protected species is completely against nature. We are
urging the Council of Agriculture (COA) to seize the two cubs immediately and
bring Huang to real justice. A fine of NT$50,000 is a mere slap on the wrist, "
said Lin Tai-jing, an EAST researcher.</P>
      <P>Lin said NT$50,000 is "too low a price to legalize an illegal act."</P>
      <P>"It's like paying the government for a permit to breed ligers," she said.</P>
      <P>Huang, however, said he did not force the two animals to breed, but admitted he
kept a male lion and a tigress together in the same space over the last few
years, dubbing the two as "childhood sweethearts" and describing the births as
"an accident."</P>
      <P>Earlier this month, Huang was accused by animal welfare advocates of selling
live tigers and bears as well as tiger bones and bear paws -- considered by some
to have medicinal properties.</P>
      <P>Huang cried foul over the accusations,  saying he runs a legitimate business.
Huang was a member of the COA wildlife conservation  panel from 1995 to 2000 and
is currently under investigation for the alleged trade of endangered species.</P>

      <P>Contract chip maker Vanguard International Semiconductor  Corp.,  a  subsidiary
of  Taiwan  Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) , said Monday its second
quarter net income was up 157 percent from a quarter earlier because of strong
global demand.</P>
      <P>Vanguard posted NT$567 million (US$17.75 million), or NT$0.34 per share, in net
profit, on sales of NT$4.23 billion, the company said in an investor conference.</P>
      <P>In the April to June period, shipments of wafers rose 16 percent from the
previous quarter, and the company's average selling price gained 2 percent to
boost total sales by 18 percent.</P>
      <P>Vanguard's second quarter gross margin rose six percentage points from a quarter
earlier to 22 percent. Large-sized logic ICs accounted for 42 percent of sales,
while small-sized logic ICs made up 23 percent, the company said.</P>
      <P>Vanguard President Fang Leuh said the company has decided to increase 2010
capital expenditure  to NT$3.6 billion from the previously planned NT$1.6
billion to expand production capacity. Just over 30 percent of the NT$3.6
billion was spent in the first half of the year.</P>
      <P>Fang said Vanguard will expand the monthly capacity of its second 8-inch wafer
plant to 116,000 units in the fourth quarter from 113,000 units in the third
quarter.</P>
      <P>Currently, the company runs two 8-inch wafer plants.</P>
      <P>Vanguard's capacity utilization was 83 percent in the first half of the year,
but Fang expected that to reach nearly 100 percent in the third quarter, with
shipments set to rise 7-9 percent.</P>
      <P>Also in the third quarter, Vanguard's gross margin is expected to rise to 24-26
percent because of a slightly higher average selling price, Fang said.</P>
      <P>TSMC currently holds a 37.44 percent stake in Vanguard.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs decided Monday to make a virtue of necessity by
granting a request by the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) to make
public the English version of Taiwan's economic cooperation framework agreement
(ECFA) with China.</P>
      <P>An anonymous economic official said the Ministry of Economic Affairs must
translate the pact into English to inform the World Trade Organization (WTO) of
its agreement with China as is required by the WTO of its members.</P>
      <P>The ministry made the decision on the eve of a legislative special session
called to ratify the pact inked by Taiwan and China June 29.</P>
      <P>The English translation will be done by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, which
will have thorough discussions with related ministries about the meaning of the
pact, and will notify China of its final English version to ensure that there
are no differences between each other's English versions presented to the WTO,
the official said.</P>
      <P>Only after the English version has been confirmed by the Chinese authorities
will it be posted on the ministry's website.</P>
      <P>However, the official said the English version is only for the purpose of
informing the WTO and that any differences between it and the Chinse version
will be resolved according to the Chinese version.</P>
      <P>The DPP lawmakers, who oppose the pact on the grounds that Taiwan's closer
economic ties with China will undermine its political independence, had demanded
that the Executive Yuan present an English translation of the pact that can be
debated in the legislature.</P>
      <P>According to the DPP, the Chinese version of the pact "might have hidden snags"
that could be exposed only in the English version to be given to the WTO.</P>
      <P>As the ruling Kuomintang, which controls two-thirds of the legislative seats, is
determined to bulldoze the pact through the legislature in a special session set
to begin the following day, a free-for-all, which is typical method of
filibustering used in the legislature, is anticipated.</P>

poll on Major League Baseball's website asking fans to name this year's best

      <P>As of 8 p.m. Monday Taiwan time, the Los Angeles Dodgers' Kuo had garnered 34
percent of the votes, the most among the six choices given.</P>
      <P>He was followed by Arthur Rhodes of the Cincinnati Reds, who had 20 percent,

      <P>Kuo's lead in the poll is not surprising because his numbers have been

in Taiwan Monday for "Taiwan-Guangdong Week, " a week-long tour focusing on
enhancing cooperation in many fields.</P>
      <P>The delegation is also expected to procure US$5.2 billion in goods while in

    <HEADLINE>Adimmune Corp. to set up databank for locally produced flu vaccine</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  16 (CNA)

(By Chen Ching-fang and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's only human vaccine manufacturer said Monday it is conducting clinical
trials to establish a databank on the efficacy and safety of locally produced
seasonal influenza vaccine.</P>
      <P>"Clinical trials will involve about 350 people in various age brackets to assess
the effectiveness and side effects of our influenza vaccine," said Adimmune
Corp. spokeswoman Shen Ya-hui.</P>
      <P>Taiwan usually imports its flu vaccine from abroad, but few foreign vaccine
manufacturers have ever conducted clinical tests on Taiwanese people to evaluate
their responses to the products, Shen said.</P>
      <P>As a result, she said, there is no data or information about the extent of the
protection the imported flu vaccines can provide to Taiwanese people.</P>
      <P>Taking influenza A(H1N1) as an example, she went on, foreign studies have shown
that older people might be as much as 30 percent immune because of the higher
chance that they were infected with a less virulent form of the virus in the
past.</P>
      <P>However, Shen said, Adimmune-conducted clinical studies have shown that
Taiwanese people are only 3 percent immune to H1N1 infection.</P>
      <P>The company's new vaccine, Shen continued, will be able to provide protection to
local people against the virulent and sometimes fatal H1N1 form of the virus,
because it contains one of the virus strains that was prevalent in Taiwan last
year.</P>
      <P>According to Shen, Adimmune is conducting the clinical trials among both adults
and children, with tests on 120 adults in two age brackets -- those aged 18-60
and those older than 60 -- getting under way Aug. 9.</P>
      <P>The pediatric clinical trials, which will be conducted among children in three
age brackets -- those aged between 6 months and 3 years; those aged between 3
and 9; and those aged between 9 and 18 -- are scheduled to start later this
month.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Shen said, the company will also conduct trials on those aged between
6 months and 1 year in order to establish an extensive databank on vaccine
efficacy and safety.</P>
      <P>As the publicly financed influenza immunization program will be launched in mid-
October, Shen continued, Adimmune will complete a mid-term report on the results
of the clinical trials before the program's launch.</P>
      <P>Afterward,  the  company  will  continue  to  monitor  the sustainability of its
vaccine's effectiveness and to track any possible side effects.</P>
      <P>"We will come up with final reports in February, June and August next year, "
she said, adding that the company hopes its clinical research will help enhance
local people's confidence in its product.</P>
      <P>The Department of Health has already ordered a total of 3 million doses of
influenza vaccine from three companies -- Sanofi-Aventis, Novartis and Adimmune
-- for the free immunization program.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Magazine digest -- China UnionPay, Taiwan banks' new opportunity</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>08/16/10  21:28:28
(The Taiwan Banker, August 2010)(translated by Kay Liu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Eighteen Taiwanese banks gained a new source of income on June 30 when Chinese
visitors were given permission to withdraw cash from the banks' ATMs in Taiwan
using their China UnionPay cards.</P>
      <P>Because Chinese nationals visiting Taiwan can only bring 20,000 Chinese yuan
(US$2,953.60) into the country, permitting use of the cards is expected to
provide a windfall for local banks, which will collect a fee for every card
transaction.</P>
      <P>UnionPay cards are commonplace today, with 1.8 billion cards issued worldwide,
of which 1.7 billion are bank cards and the remainder branded credit cards.</P>
      <P>Considering that more than 1 million Chinese nationals are expected to visit
Taiwan this year, banks could generate considerable fees from liberalized use of
the card.</P>
      <P>Taiwan began accepting UnionPay cards as a payment method in August 2009,
launching a fierce competition among banks to become the "acquiring bank" for
local merchants because of the attractive fees the cards represent.</P>
      <P>Payments made with UnionPay cards in Taiwan totaled NT$5.5 billion (US$171.88
million) from August last year to June this year, officials said at the June 30
launch ceremony.</P>
      <P>China UnionPay gets 1.2 percent of each transaction and the "acquiring bank" --
the bank that processes the credit card payment for the merchant -- gets a fee
of about 2 percent of the transaction.</P>
      <P>The four major acquiring financial institutions in Taiwan at present are the
National Credit Card Center, American Express, Chinatrust Commercial Bank and
Taiwan Cooperative Bank, with market shares of 25.8 percent, 24.7 percent, 22
percent and 5.27 percent respectively.</P>
      <P>Perhaps even more lucrative will be ATM fees. Local banks will charge UnionPay
cardholders US$1 per withdrawal, of which NT$10 will be given to the Financial
Information Service Company (FISC) , responsible for settling interbank payments
with China UnionPay, and NT$1.5 to the Bankers Association of the Republic of
China.</P>
      <P>The remainder, about NT$21, will go to the bank, so if China's 1 million
visitors make an average of two ATM cash withdrawals per person per trip, local
banks will make NT$42 million in fees.</P>
      <P>Among the 18 banks, which have 16,000 ATMs or 64 percent of the total found in
Taiwan, Taishin Bank and Chinatrust are expected to profit most from the fee
windfall as they have more ATMs than their rivals. Five more banks are expected
to join the system at a future date.</P>
      <P>Another major opportunity for Taiwanese banks in the future will be fee income
on credit card payments and cash withdrawals in China. ATMs in China currently
do not accept Taiwanese bank cards unless the cards are co-branded with an
international organization, such as Visa or MasterCard.</P>
      <P>While the FISC is pushing to have all Taiwanese bank cards accepted in China,
Taiwanese banks are also looking to issue UnionPay cards for use in China once
the government lifts restrictions on the business.</P>
      <P>The advantage of the UnionPay cards would be that they save cardholders currency
exchange costs, as it would convert yuan into Taiwan dollars directly without
first converting it into U.S. dollars, as is the case with Visa and MasterCard
at present.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOEA aims to make e-commerce trillion-dollar business in six years</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) said Monday that it will invest NT$450
million (US$14.06 million) in e-commerce over the next six years in a bid to
develop it into a NT$1 trillion business within that time period.</P>
      <P>The MOEA noted that e-commerce bucked the trend by growing when the world was in
sharp decline during the economic crisis that began in 2008, which is why the
MOEA proposed an action plan on Mandarin Chinese e-commerce development with the
aim of making Taiwan the operations center of the world's Chinese e-commerce.</P>
      <P>Under the draft proposal, the government will invest the money between now and
2015.</P>
      <P>The MOEA has estimated that the revenues of e-commerce in 2010 will be NT$452
billion, and that although there are currently no e-commerce businesses in
Taiwan with revenues of over NT$10 billion per year, the first such business
could be revealed next year, with a further seven companies with annual revenues
of NT$10 billion by 2015.</P>
      <P>Yeh Yun-lung, director-general of the MOEA's Commerce Department, said that if
Taiwan can succeed in branching out its e-commerce business, especially in the
vast China market, then its growth will be stunning.</P>
      <P>"If we can take the China market, then we feel that it will become a trillion
dollar business in five or six years," he added.</P>
      <P>Yeh noted that the ministry's action plan will include the marketing of special
Taiwanese products and cyber services to the Chinese market, as well as the
promotion of cross-agency coordination to solve any problems of Taiwanese
e-commerce in the Mandarin market.</P>

      <P>Taiwanese tennis player Lu Yen-hsun moved up four notches to 40th in the latest
Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) rankings released Monday, the highest
ranking of his career.</P>
      <P>Lu picked up 115 points for winning two qualifying matches and reaching the
third round of the main draw at the Rogers Cup in Toronto last week, but it was
not enough for him to move inside the top 40.</P>
      <P>He has been ranked in the top 50 since reaching the quarterfinals of Wimbledon
in early July.</P>
      <P>The 27-year-old hopes to push even higher this week, but he will face his
toughest draw of the summer, going up against Australian Lleyton Hewitt of
Australia in the opening round.</P>
      <P>Hewitt may be vulnerable, however. He has only played two hardcourt matches this
summer and was forced to retire in the second set of a match in Washington, D.C.
in early August with a calf injury.</P>
      <P>If Lu were to defeat the Australian, he would then play world No. 5 Robin
Soderling of Sweden.</P>

      <P>A travel fair in Taipei that hosted a record number of participating Chinese
travel agents failed at its close Monday to reach the organizers' goal for the
total number of visitors over its four-day run.</P>
      <P>A total of 118,003 people visited the Taipei Cross-Strait Travel Fair, a number
that fell short of the organizers' original target of 150,000 visitors.</P>
      <P>This year also marks the first time Chinese exhibitors will not attend the
Taipei International Travel Fair slated to take place Nov. 5-8 this year, after
taking part in the fair organized by the Taiwan Visitors Association (TVA) and
the Beijing-based Cross-Strait Tourism Association.</P>
      <P>TVA spokeswoman Chen Ying-ting blamed the upcoming start of the new school
semester for the poorer- than-expected turnout.</P>
      <P>"As the summer vacation is coming to an end, not many families have further
travel plans," she told CNA in a telephone interview.</P>
      <P>"Some parents might also be looking to save money to pay for tuition as the
schools open next month," Chen added.</P>
      <P>"So although many big discounts were offered at the fair, many people were still
not attracted," she said.</P>
      <P>The organizers of the show said that in an effort to boost visitor numbers in
future, they are considering moving the fair to June next year.</P>
      <P>A record of nearly 1,200 representatives from 190 tourism associations or travel
agencies throughout China took part in the fair, the organizers added, saying
that a total of 871 booths were manned, including 516 by Taiwanese exhibitors.</P>
      <P>Chen lauded the Chinese exhibitors  for adopting different promotion tactics
this year.</P>
      <P>"This year, their booths were better designed. They also put on folk songs,
dances and martial arts performances," she noted.</P>
      <P>Despite their tactics, however, the Chinese exhibitors apparently failed to
compete with their Taiwanese counterparts in attracting visitors to their
booths, as the majority of visitors lined up for discounted  dining coupons
offered  by some of the Taiwanese exhibitors, mainly local major hotels.</P>
      <P>Another favorite among the visitors was the Taiwan agricultural pavilion,
consisting of 250 booths offering tea, dried fruit, nut cookies, grilled
sausages, dried squid and other well-known local delicacies.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the Chinese exhibitors were dissatisfied with the turnouts at
their booths, Chen said they actually had better turnouts than they had enjoyed
for the past four years, but she did not provide specific figures.</P>
      <P>"This year, they also learned from their Taiwanese counterparts how best to
cater to local visitors, and will probably follow suit next year," she added.</P>

      <P>The Executive Yuan approved on Monday a three-year NT$1.45 billion (US$45.3
million) budget to fund a program that will upgrade the equipment used by the
police force and strengthen officers' skills.</P>
      <P>The budget will fund the "Police Development Program, " which involves enhancing
the emergency command system, developing better bomb-defusing and forensic
skills, purchasing police vehicles, and strengthening high-tech crime
investigation capabilities.</P>
      <P>Expanding databases, updating maps,  augmenting the digital recording system for
reported crimes, and developing a system to help hearing and speech impaired
people report crimes are all part of the emergency command system plan, said
Interior Minister Jiang Yi-huah.</P>
      <P>On buying new vehicles, the National Police Agency said 45 percent of police
force vehicles are being used beyond their expiration date and 57 percent of
patrol cars have traveled more than 500,000 kilometers.</P>
      <P>Jiang said 359 old police cars and 571 motorcycles will be eliminated, and 397
new cars and 147 motorcycles will be purchased.</P>
      <P>The focus on developing forensic skills will be on improving forensic technology

      <P>The Formosa Plastics Group (FPG) reached an agreement with the Yunlin County
government Monday on compensation over a string of recent mishaps at its
petrochemical complex in the county's Mailiao Township.</P>
      <P>The FPG agreed to pay up to NT$500 million (US$15.63 million) in compensation
for the agricultural and fishery losses caused by the two fires last month.</P>
      <P>The agreement was reached after FPG Vice Chairwoman Susan Wang met with Yunlin
County Magistrate Su Chih-fen.</P>
      <P>The county government made several requests during the meeting, including asking
the Formosa Plastics Group to pay for a health risk assessment and epidemiology
investigation in the area.</P>
      <P>On setting up a NT$10 billion agricultural and fishery stability fund, Formosa
Plastics agreed to set aside NT$3 billion over four years, with the county
government hoping to solicit assistance from the central government for the
remaining amount.</P>
      <P>The FPG also agreed to subsidize a forestation project of up to 2,600 hectares
to help cut carbon emissions.</P>
      <P>The Yunlin County government asked the company to stop production once it has

      <P>"Singapore  fever"  appears  from time to time in Taiwan. Politicians scramble
to visit Singapore, professedly to learn from the city state's experience, and
take pride in seeing Lee Kuan Yew. There are also articles discussing "if
Singapore can, why can't Taiwan?"</P>
      <P>Singapore has thus become a holy place for Taiwanese politicians. But in all
these years, what has Taiwan learned from Singapore?</P>
      <P>In the latest outbreak of the fever, Kaohsiung County Magistrate Yang Chiu-
hsing, who quit the Democratic Progressive Party to run in the year-end election
for the new special municipality of Kaohsiung, will visit Singapore next month.
Kuomintang Secretary-General King Pu-tsung, meanwhile, will also accompany his
party's Kaohsiung mayoral candidate Huang Chao-shun to the city state, with a
plan to meet Lee.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has not matched any of Singapore's achievements, including its
liberalized economy, strict laws, clean and competent civil service,
enterprising  government and business sector,  strong leadership, and good use
of the country's excellent strategic position.</P>
      <P>Democratic development is the only area in which Taiwan has surpassed Singapore.
It is ironic that two major candidates in a democratic election are going on a

    <HEADLINE>Talk of the day -- Emerging challenges of demographic transition</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>08/17/10  11:25:13
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's total fertility rate -- the average number of children to be born to a
woman over her lifetime -- is likely to drop below 1 this year for the first
time to 0.94, according to a biennial demographic assessment released by the
Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) Monday.</P>
      <P>For many years, Taiwan has lagged behind other major Asian countries in terms of
both fertility rate and birth rate -- the average annual number of births during
a year per 1,000 persons in the population.</P>
      <P>According to the latest CEPD estimate, Taiwan's population will reach zero
population growth in 2022, four years earlier than previously forecast, and the
population will begin to decrease from the following year.</P>
      <P>The advent of zero growth will impact the education system and labor market,
and the country's competitiveness will also be adversely affected, CEPD
officials warned.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from local media coverage of the issue:</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>Chen Shih-chang, director of the CEPD's Department of Manpower Planning, said
Taiwan's low fertility rate has led to the rapid aging of the population.
Fourteen percent of the total population will be over 65 years old in 2017, a
ratio that will make Taiwan an aging society as generally defined in the
international community.</P>
      <P>The aging  of the population  will  have  serious  social consequences, with
schools having difficulty recruiting students and companies having a hard time
finding employees, Chen said.</P>
      <P>At present, Taiwan still benefits from a "demographic dividend, " with every 100
working-age people supporting an average of 36 dependents, but it will shift to
a "demographic debt" in 2034 when every working-age people will have to support
an average of more than 1.5 dependents, a phenomenon that will pose a heavy
burden on the economy and health care system, Chen said. (Aug. 17, 2010).</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>Taiwan's fertility rate has been on a steady decline since reaching 1.6 in 2001.
It hit a low of 1.03 in 2009, the world's second lowest, higher only than that
of Germany, according to the latest CEPD report.</P>
      <P>The report predicted that the fertility rate will drop further to an estimated
0.94 this year because of the traditional superstition that the Year of the
Tiger is not a good time for babies to be born.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, the CEPD optimistically forecast that the fertility rate will
rebound next year and may reach a peak in 2012 -- the Year of the Dragon,
traditionally seen as an auspicious time for birth. Moreover, it said the
government has offered incentives to encourage birth, including childbirth and
rearing subsidies.</P>
      <P>The CEPD also suggested that the government speed up efforts to craft a
comprehensive health care system, promote a healthy way of life and improve the
social security system.</P>
      <P>With Taiwan facing a rapidly aging population, the CEPD said the government
should increase investment in manpower cultivation and boost the labor
participation rate, encourage economic immigration and extend the mandatory
retirement age. (Aug. 17, 2010). Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>Former CEPD Chairman Hu Sheng-cheng said the aging population will have a
negative impact on GDP growth because it will lead to a decline in the size of
the working population and reduce consumer spending.</P>
      <P>He noted, however, that some academics have a different view on the issue. They
believe that as Taiwan has limited space and natural resources, slow population
growth may not necessarily be a bad thing and that per capita GDP will not
necessarily decline, Hu said.</P>
      <P>But Chou Chi, a Shih Hsin University economics professor, said population aging
will not only affect labor productivity but also increase young people's
financial burden as well as health care and social welfare spending. (Aug. 17,
2010).</P>

    <DATELINE>After Taiwan was admitted  to the World Trade Organization  (WTO)
08/17/10  11:56:43

    <TEXT>
      <P>in 2002, the price of rice wine gradually rose from NT$22 per bottle to NT$180
per bottle, with the alcohol excise tax accounting for NT$111.</P>
      <P>The unreasonable situation resulted in the hoarding of rice wine and prevalent
bootlegging. This is demonstrated in the plunge in Taiwan Tobacco &amp; Liquor
Corp.'s rice wine sales, from 220 million bottles per year before WTO accession
to 7.5 million bottles afterwards.</P>
      <P>This painful experience could have been avoided had Taiwan insisted that rice
wine, 96 percent of which is used for cooking, be taxed as "cooking wine"
instead of distilled spirits during WTO accession talks.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan is finally taking action to address the situation, which has
drawn widespread public complaints. After successfully dropping the price of
rice wine to NT$50 per bottle by taxing alcoholic beverages based on alcohol
content from June 1, 2009, the Executive Yuan decided recently to amend the
Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Act to re-categorize rice wine as "cooking wine, " which
would decrease the price further to NT$25 per bottle.</P>
      <P>Taiwan should fully prepare to fight the case at the WTO and make the United
States and European Union understand that under the national treatment principle
(which bars treating imported goods differently from similar domestic goods in
the local market) , imported cooking rice can also enjoy a lower excise tax
rate.</P>
      <P>The people of Taiwan have too often paid an unreasonable price just to gain
accession to the WTO.  The latest move by the administration of President Ma
Ying-jeou will remedy the previous error and restore fairness to consumers.

    <HEADLINE>Increasing cross-strait military imbalance troubling, says U.S.</HEADLINE>

08/17/10  12:19:14

    <TEXT>
      <P>Despite closer economic and cultural exchanges across the Taiwan Strait, a
Pentagon official said Monday that China's military buildup opposite Taiwan is
troubling.</P>
      <P>"We do see a continuation of troubling -- of troubling trends -- that include
what we perceive as an increased Chinese activity in strengthening their hand
across the strait, " said the Pentagon official,  referring to the just-released
report "Military and Security Developments Involving the People's Republic of
China 2010."</P>
      <P>"This is a time when we've seen progress on the diplomatic front and the
economic front, and yet in the security, the military field, we've seen no
change in Chinese behavior, " said the official, whose name was withheld as he
was speaking on background.</P>
      <P>Pentagon authors said in the report that China's People's Liberation Army (PLA)
is developing the capability to deter Taiwan independence or influence Taiwan to
settle the dispute on Beijing's terms while simultaneously attempting to deter,
delay, or deny any possible U.S. support for the island in case of conflict.</P>
      <P>"The balance of cross-Strait military forces continues to shift in the
mainland's favor," the report said.</P>
      <P>China's comprehensive military modernization is supported by the continued
increase in government funding, the report said.</P>
      <P>On March 4 of this year, Beijing announced a 7.5 percent increase in its
military budget to approximately US$78.6 billion, continuing more than two
decades of sustained annual increases in China's announced military budget.</P>
      <P>According to the report, by December 2009, the PLA had deployed between 1,050
and 1,150 CSS-6 and CSS-7 short-range ballistic missiles to units opposite
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"It is upgrading the lethality of the force, including by introducing  variants
of these missiles with improved ranges, accuracies, and payloads," the report
said.</P>
      <P>The PLA has made modest improvements in the transparency of China's military and
security affairs. However, many uncertainties remain  regarding  how China will
use its expanding  military capabilities, the report said.</P>
      <P>The limited transparency in China's military and security affairs enhances
uncertainty and increases the potential for misunderstanding and miscalculation,
one official said.</P>
      <P>"(It is)  also perhaps even more troubling  given China's increasing military
capabilities -- a cycle that increases the risk that miscommunication and
misperception could lead to miscalculation, "another senior official said at the
press briefing.</P>
      <P>The cross-strait military imbalance becomes more obvious when the scales of the
two sides' armed forces are compared. China's army maintains 400,000 ground
forces personnel based in three military regions opposite Taiwan, compared to
Taiwan's 130,000.</P>
      <P>In the air force, the PLA bases 330 combat fighters within unrefueled
operational range of Taiwan, along with 160 bombers and 40 transports, while
Taiwan has 388 jet fighters, 22 attack/bombers and 21 transports, according to
the report.</P>
      <P>A comparison of naval forces shows that the PLA has a 15: 4 edge over Taiwan in
destroyers, a 40:22 edge in cruisers, a 25:12 edge in amphibious ships, and a
32:4 edge in diesel attack subs, according to the report.</P>

      <P>EVA Airways' share price rose sharply in heavy trade Tuesday morning after the
carrier reported strong earnings for the first half of this year, dealers said,
but prices fell back later in the session.</P>
      <P>EVA Air shares jumped by the maximum 7 percent to NT$26.25 in the first half
hour of trading but were then hit by profit-taking. At 12:43 p.m., it was up
NT$0.15 at NT$24.70, with 125.6 million shares changing hands.</P>
      <P>EVA Air announced Monday that it posted NT$5.22 billion (US$163 million) in net
profit in the January-June period, compared with a net loss of NT$1.68 billion
for the first half of 2009 and NT$2.84 billion for the entire year.</P>
      <P>In 2008, the carrier also registered a net loss of NT$16.89 billion amid
skyrocketing international fuel prices and a global financial meltdown.</P>
      <P>"Investors are happy with the six-month earnings as the world's airline business
climbed from a low on a global economic recovery, " Hua Nan Securities analyst
Henry Miao said.</P>
      <P>Miao said the summer vacation has lifted passenger numbers and the economic
recovery has driven increases in air cargo volume.</P>
      <P>"In Taiwan, the airline sector has a plus to further boost their bottom line, "
Miao said. "That's direct flights across the Taiwan Strait."</P>
      <P>TLG Asset Management analyst Arch Shih agreed, saying the 2010 Shanghai Expo,
which opened in May,  attracted many Taiwanese tourists.</P>
      <P>Earlier this year, EVA Air and rival China Airlines said the load factor on the
route between Taipei Songshan Airport and Shanghai Hongqiao Airport exceeded 90
percent, and hoped authorities in both countries would raise the number of
flights to meet demand.</P>
      <P>"EVA Air's share price has been boosted recently by strong demand across the
Taiwan Strait. Cross-strait ties have stirred up much speculation of more
momentum in the stocks," Shih said.</P>
      <P>Stable fuel prices have also helped underpin the company's strong first-half
earnings, the analyst said. Fuel spending accounts for 20-22 percent of a
carrier's total operating costs.</P>
      <P>Shih said, however, that the stock was moving toward technical resistance at
around NT$26.25, and he warned investors of a possible pullback after recent
robust gains, as in fact happened later in Tuesday's session.</P>

      <P>Clashes erupted between protesters and the police Tuesday morning when thousands
of angry local residents blocked all three major roads leading to the Formosa
Plastic Group's (FPG) petrochemical complex in Yunlin County after compensation
talks broke down the previous day.</P>
      <P>Using blow horns and loud speakers, the angry crowd laid siege to the complex,
demanding that the conglomerate pay residents NT$1.8 billion (US$53 million) for
polluting the area and harming their health and promise to relocate later this
decade.</P>
      <P>Close to 1,000 police and at least three prosecutors were dispatched to the
scene in an effort to clear the way for complex employees and keep watch against
any illegal activities.</P>
      <P>According to local reports, seven people were arrested by 10 a.m. for ramming
through police lines. Police said the demonstration violated the Assembly and
Parade Act because the organizer did not obtain prior approval from authorities
to hold the protest.</P>
      <P>On Monday, the third round of compensation talks ended in acrimony when the
plastic giant refused to agree to the residents' demand for a NT$1.8 billion
compensation package.</P>
      <P>Wang Chang,  the FPG representative,  said the demand was unacceptable and the
company has already reached its maximum by offering NT$500 million in overall
compensation.</P>
      <P>The group also agreed to subsidize a forestation project of up to 2,600 hectares
to help curb carbon emissions.</P>
      <P>The talks came after a huge fire on July 25 which set one of the complex's oil
refining plants ablaze, the second fire at the complex in three weeks.</P>
      <P>Residents of Mailiao Township where the complex is located and of other nearby
villages accused the plant of having poor safety precautions and of neglecting
the potential health risks for people living near the facility.</P>
      <P>The residents,  mainly farmers and fishermen,  have formed self-help groups and
demanded that the plant shut down immediately until a more thorough health risk
and safety assessment has been conducted.</P>
      <P>The complex in Mailiao Township is the fifth largest in Asia.</P>

      <P>We have consistently urged the government to draft a plan for Taiwan's long-term

(DPP), as the largest opposition party, will present a comprehensive set of
economic policies and arguments.</P>
      <P>In response to a recent announcement by Taiwan and Singapore taht they plan to
begin free trade talks, the DPP said this was no breakthrough because the effort
was launched when it was in power. The party also said Taiwan should set some
priorities and put the United States, Japan and the European Union at the top of
its list in the effort to sign free trade agreements with other countries,
instead of targeting Singapore as a matter of expediency.</P>
      <P>The DPP's statement amounted to a denouncement of itself for failing to set
priorities in the past and an admission that it had approached Singapore on an
FTA because it was convenient to do so.</P>
      <P>A similar contradiction was seen in the DPP's position on the Kuokuang
Petrochemical Park. Although the DPP promoted the project when it was in power,
it is now saying that the economic value of the project should not take
precedence over environmental concerns. This amounts to a confession that when
the DPP was in power, it attached greater importance to the economy than to the
environment.</P>
      <P>These examples show that the DPP still has not developed a comprehensive policy

    <TEXT>
      <P>A U.S. Department of State official said Monday that the Japan-U.S. security
pact still applies to the Senkaku Islands even if the administration of
President Barack Obama has not stated so explicitly.</P>
      <P>The Senkaku Islands, known in Chinese as the Tiaoyutais, have been under the
administrative control of the government of Japan and are therefore subject to
the Japan-U.S. security treaty signed in 1960,  Philip  Crowley,  assistant
secretary  under the State Department's Bureau of Public Affairs, said at a news
briefing.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has been one of the countries along with Japan and China that claims
sovereignty over the uninhabited island group, a stance that has been a thorn in
unofficial bilateral ties between Taiwan and Japan.</P>
      <P>The Kyodo News reported recently that the Obama administration has not
explicitly stated that the islands are subject to the Japan-U.S. security treaty
-- in a shift from the position held by former President George W. Bush.</P>
      <P>Washington is believed to have shifted its position to avoid irritating Beijing
while trying to secure China's cooperation in helping the U.S. recover from the
financial crisis, Kyodo cited a source familiar with the matter as saying
Monday.</P>
      <P>On whether the Obama administration has shifted Washington's stance on the
Senkaku Islands, Crowley said, "We have not changed our position."</P>
      <P>The stance of the preceding Bush administration was that the Senkaku Islands
have been under Japan's administrative control since having been returned as
part of the reversion of Okinawa in 1972; that Article 5 of the 1960 U.S.-Japan
Security Treaty applies to the territories under the Japanese administration;
and that Article 5 of the pact applies to the Senkaku Islands.</P>
      <P>When the Japanese government sought confirmation of the U.S. position on the
island in March 2009, the Obama administration repeated the first two
formulations but it did not mention directly that the Senkaku Islands are
covered under the pact, the Kyodo report said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou called Tuesday for an institutionalized mechanism to
boost trade between Taiwan and Japan, basing his optimism on what he called a
beneficial triangular scenario after the signing of a landmark trade deal with
China.</P>
      <P>"The clinching of a cross-Taiwan Strait economic cooperation framework agreement
(ECFA)  in late June has helped create a beneficial three-way situation among
Taiwan,  China and Japan, allowing them not to 'take sides' in the relationship,
" Ma told a group of professors from the University of Tokyo and Keio University
at the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>Citing an analysis by Nomura Research Institute, Ma said Japanese companies
would stand a better chance of success (78 percent instead of 68 percent)
tapping into the Chinese market if they team up with their long-term Taiwanese
partners in the ECFA era.</P>
      <P>With this in mind, Taiwan hopes to build an institutionalized trade and commerce
mechanism  with Japan to enhance bilateral exchanges, the president said.</P>
      <P>"But the two sides are still assessing the form of the bilateral mechanism that
should be established," he added.</P>
      <P>Since assuming office in May 2008, Ma said, he has been eager to pursue improved
ties with Japan and some initial progress has been made.</P>
      <P>Taiwan, for example, opened a Hokkaido office in Sapporo last December and from
October this year, Taipei's Songshan Airport and Tokyo's Haneda Airport will
resume two-way direct flights, he noted.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's next initiative in boosting ties with Japan will be to sponsor an
exhibition of the National Palace Museum's treasures there, he said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's share prices closed down 0.12 percent Tuesday after gains posted by old
economy stocks were offset by slowing momentum in the high-tech sector as
concerns linger over global demand in the second half of the year, dealers said.</P>
      <P>The weighted index fell 10.13 points to close at the day's low of 7,931.09, off
a high of 7,973.15, on turnover of NT$132.36 billion (US$4.14 billion).</P>
      <P>The market opened up 0.27 percent and quickly moved to the day's high as select
non-high tech sectors with close business ties with China extended gains from
the previous session.</P>
      <P>But the electronics sector remained haunted by fears of a slower global economy,
prompting investors to cut their holdings, dealers said.</P>
      <P>A total of 1,842 stocks closed down and 1,870 finished higher, while 300
remained unchanged.</P>
      <P>The foodstuff sector posted the highest gains of any sector, rising 3.9 percent.
Construction shares rose 2.1 percent and textile stocks gained 1.8 percent.</P>
      <P>The financial sector closed down 0.6 percent, the plastics and chemical sector
lost 0.4 percent, the paper and pulp sector fell 0.3 percent, and cement and
machinery and electronics shares fell 0.2 percent.</P>
      <P>"Expectations remain in place that traditional industrial stocks, such as food
and textile firms, will benefit from closer ties across the Taiwan Strait,"
Concord Securities analyst Allen Lin said.</P>
      <P>Lin said investors also have high hopes that Morgan Stanley Capital
International (MSCI) will soon include more Taiwanese old economy stocks into
its emerging market index.</P>
      <P>Recently, the non-high tech sector has outperformed the broader market, Lin
said,</P>
      <P>"But its strength was not significant enough to help the market overcome the
strong technical resistance above 8,000 points." Lin said, "As long as trade in
the high-tech sector is slow, the market is unlikely to get out of its current
doldrums."</P>
      <P>Lin said electronics have lost steam as foreign institutional investors remain
sidelined on fears of further volatility on Wall Street.</P>
      <P>He said growing margin trade has also been a factor destabilizing the market,
and described the NT$274 billion of outstanding shares bought on margin as very
high.</P>
      <P>In the foodstuff sector, Uni-President Enterprises rose 6.87 percent to NT$38.10
and Taisun Enterprise added 6.91 percent to NT$20.10.</P>
      <P>Among textile stocks, Shinkong Synthetic Fibers added 2.06 percent to NT$12.40
and Far Eastern New Century rose 1.65 percent to NT$39.95.</P>
      <P>Personal computer firm AsusTek fell 3.35 percent to NT$230.50 and smartphone
maker HTC lost 1.93 percent to NT$611.00.</P>

      <P>Taiwanese violinist Yo-yo Fann, playing with Peru's National Symphony Orchestra
in Lima Sunday, moved the audience to tears with his rendition of a famous
Peruvian piece "Song of Eagles."</P>
      <P>According to the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in Peru, the performance by
the 23-year-old Fann was so enthralling that not only was the audience in tears,
but the violinist was invited to return to Peru for another concert.</P>
      <P>Conductor Pablo Sabat, who is also a renowned Peruvian pianist, said that
despite Fann's youth he was able to give a perfect interpretation of Brahms
Violin Concerto during the concert.</P>
      <P>Sabat said that he was very pleased to perform with Fann and looked forward to
doing so again.</P>
      <P>As part of his schedule in Peru, Fann gave a solo concert Aug. 11, which was

      <P>Youth Olympics silver medalist Kuo Hsing-chun, who has professed a desire to
meet her birth father, was supported by her mother Tuesday, who said she
respects her daughter's desire to meet her father, who she has never met.</P>
      <P>Kuo, who took silver in the women's 53 kg weightlifting division at the games in
Singapore with a total score of 174 kg., said upon receiving her medal that she
hoped to meet her dad and share her glory with him.</P>
      <P>Kuo appealed to the Taiwanese public to help her find her father.</P>
      <P>Kuo's mother, overwhelmed by mixed feelings of her daughter's exceptional
performance  in international  competition and her heart-rending wish to find
her dad, said she would not oppose her search.</P>
      <P>"I'll bless her if she insists," Kuo's mother said.</P>
      <P>Kuo said Hsing-chun's father left home when she was only a few months old and
never returned. She also pointed out that although she brought the infant Hsing-
chun back to her father's maternal home, her father did not come to visit.</P>
      <P>Kuo said Hsing-chun has been a source of pride, as the child has always been
happy and thoughtful, has barely mentioned her dad and has taken the family's
poverty in her stride.</P>
      <P>It has always been Hsing-chun's philosophy that "poor people can be happy too,"
her mother said.</P>
      <P>Tai Hsia-ling, the minister of Taiwan's Sports Affairs Council, attended the
weightlifting event in Singapore and afterward presented Kuo with a
congratulatory  message on behalf of President Ma Ying-jeou, as well as a cash
prize.</P>
      <P>The games, which are the first Olympics designed for athletes between the ages
of 14 and 18, opened in Singapore over the weekend. Some 3,200 athletes from

    <DATELINE>08/17/10  17:13:02</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A man who closely resembles late President Chiang Kai-shek has become Taiwan's
secret weapon with the Chinese communists -- not in fighting them as did the
generalissimo but in getting them to visit Taiwan on vacation.</P>
      <P>Lee Deng-ke, 82, once served as a body guard for President Chiang Ching-kuo, the
son of President Chiang Kai-shek, but he only began gaining recognition when he
served as a volunteer guide at a Hualien theme park after retiring from Chiang's
entourage.</P>
      <P>Visitors often mistook him for Chiang Kai-shek, giving a local travel agent the
idea of using him as a drawing card after improving relations with China opened
the door to an influx of Chinese tourists in mid-2008.</P>
      <P>Lee now serves as a tour guide who takes Chinese visitors to Chiang Kai-shek's
mausoleum in Cihhu, Taoyuan County, and Chiang's residence in Shilin, Taipei
City. He is often surrounded by his guests eager to have their picture taken
with him at the sites.</P>
      <P>Lee says that after having come in contact with so many visitors from China, he
can figure out where in China they come from simply by the way they address him.</P>
      <P>"People from southern China usually have a lot of respect for Chiang and will
call me 'generalissimo, ' while people from northern China tend to simply call
me Chiang Kai-shek."</P>
      <P>Chiang, who led China in his capacity as a generalissimo of a junta during
China's eight-year war against Japan, was forced to move his Chinese Nationalist
government to Taiwan in 1949 after losing a civil war to the communists.</P>
      <P>He was known for spending his remaining years in Taiwan until his death in 1975
in the forlorn hope of revenging his humiliating defeat against the communists
and reclaiming the Chinese mainland.</P>
      <P>His staunchly anti-communist approach prevented any contact between Taiwan and
China, but Lee's popularity reflects a new era of greater openness between the
two countries that could bring more than 1 million Chinese nationals to Taiwan
this year.</P>
      <P>The new opportunity created by improving ties has also given Lee the chance to
try to dispel the image that Chiang's Kuomintang (KMT) was notoriously corrupt.</P>
      <P>When Chinese tourists offer him tips after taking their picture with him, Lee
denies them the privilege of greasing the palms of "Chiang Kai-shek."</P>
      <P>"The generalissimo is not so poor that he has to take tips, " Lee protests.</P>
      <P>Because of his growing fame, Lee has been asked by many businessmen to endorse
their products in commercials. There have been so many requests that he had to
retain an agent to deal with them.</P>
      <P>He may also give politics a go. Lee said he would not rule out making
appearances for KMT candidates in the mayoral elections of Taiwan's five special
municipalities.</P>
      <P>So it should not be a surprise if the old generalissimo is seen barnstorming for
his party's candidates during the upcoming campaign. enditem/ls By Maubo Chang

      <P>Z-Obee Holdings Ltd., a China-based cell phone and communications equipment
producer and distributor, is expected to list Taiwan depository receipts (TDRs)
in the fourth quarter of this year, underwriter Polaris Securities said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>"Z-Obee has filed an application with the Taiwan Stock Exchange to issue TDRs,
hoping to raise NT$880 million (US$27.53 million) for future business expansion,
" said a Polaris Securities official in charge of the share sale plan.</P>
      <P>He said that if the TDR application is approved by the Taiwanese authorities,
Z-Obee will become the first company in the greater China area to be listed in
Singapore, Hong Kong and Taiwan at the same time.</P>
      <P>Z-Obee was listed on the Singapore Exchange in November 2009 and on the Hong
Kong Stock Exchange in March 2010.</P>
      <P>According to the company's prospectus, Z-Obee is planning to issue up to 80
million TDRs, each one of which will represent one common share at NT$11 per
unit.</P>
      <P>Polaris Securities said Z-Obee is also planning to use the share issuance plan
to build up its visibility in the Taiwan market for future product marketing and
sales.</P>
      <P>Z-Obee, which makes and distributes cell phones and components as well as
communications solution designs, has launched its own cell phone brand "VIM" in
China and Hong Kong, and is also developing netbook computers, set-top boxes and

      <P>The company has a production base in Shenzhen and a research and development
center in Shanghai.</P>
      <P>China and Hong Kong are the company's revenue sources, making up 79.50 percent
and 20.50 percent, respectively, of its total sales recorded in the April
2009-March 2010 period.</P>
      <P>In the April 2009-March 2010 period, Z-Obee posted US$5.20 million in net

      <P>The work of nine young Taiwanese artists will be featured at an international
art exhibition in Taipei this month, which will give them an opportunity to
break into the global art scene, the Council for Cultural Affairs (CCA) said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Their work will be among the paintings, sculptures, multimedia, video,
photography and installation art that will be displayed by 110 exhibitors from
15 countries or cities at Art Taipei 2010, said Hsu Keng-Hsiu, a CCA department
director.</P>
      <P>"The nine Taiwanese artists, who were selected by the CCA from a field of 202
competitors under the age of 35, will present their art in a section of the
exhibition titled 'Made in Taiwan -- Young Artist Discovery,'" Hsu said.</P>
      <P>One of the selected artists, Hsu Wei-Hui, uses a special medium -- cosmetic
facial masks --to create installation art that shows various facial expressions
such as horror, terror and happiness.</P>
      <P>"Through my work, I want to examine issues relating to women's appearance and
inner fears," the artist said.</P>
      <P>Another artist, Lin Yu-Ting, uses cake decorating techniques to create several
small houses that are reminiscent of those built in her hometown of Tainan,
southern Taiwan, in the 1950s to 1970s.</P>
      <P>"These structures all seem similar, but if you look closely, you will see that
each one has its own special features, " said Lin, pointing at her miniature
houses.</P>
      <P>Lin said that as part of the process, she learned how to make an actual cake in
order to refine her artistic skills.</P>
      <P>"I plan to one day use this skill to create installation and video art of a
community and a city scene," she told the Central News Agency.</P>
      <P>The show, which is now in its 17th year, provides a platform for young upcoming
Taiwanese artists to gain international exposure, said Hsu Keng-Hsiu.</P>
      <P>"One of the artists who took part in last year's show, Ho Meng-chuan, has since
signed a contract with the Saatchi Gallery in the U.K., while others have had
opportunities to attend various international fairs in the United States and
Shanghai," she said.</P>
      <P>The exhibition is being organized by the CCA, the Taiwan Art Gallery Association

Kaohsiung County's Shanlin Township for the survivors of mudslide-battered
Siaolin Village who were displaced by Typhoon Morakot last August, the county

construction on a 5-hectare site dubbed the "Second Siaolin Village" is

    <HEADLINE>Scholar makes push for change in approach on reverse mortgages</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 17 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>A real estate expert suggested Tuesday that Taiwan should treat schemes that
help the elderly live off the equity built up in their houses as commercial
products rather than social welfare benefits to ensure that the system can be
sustained.</P>
      <P>At a seminar on the subject on Tuesday, Chang Chin-oh, a professor in National
Chengchi University's Department of Land Economics,  strongly  advocated  using
reverse  mortgages  and sale/leaseback to help senior citizens who have low
incomes but a house of their own boost their disposable income.</P>
      <P>But he said the focus of the proposed system to implement the schemes should be
adjusted.</P>
      <P>At present, government initiatives to launch the financing plans are being
handled by the Ministry of the Interior, which treats them as pensions, with the
government providing most of the financing.</P>
      <P>Chang argued at a seminar on the subject, however, that loans are by definition
financial products and involve managing flows of money, meaning that financial
authorities should take charge of them.</P>
      <P>He also contended that for the system to be sustainable, reverse mortgages would
have to become commercialized rather than arranged by the government.</P>
      <P>It would lift a heavy financial burden off the government's shoulders, and for
markets, "more choices would be a good thing," he said.</P>
      <P>Chang and other real experts have pushed for reverse mortgages as a way to cope
with Taiwan's rapidly aging society and low birth rate, which could eventually
limit senior citizen pensions and the income the elderly get from their
children.</P>
      <P>Reverse mortgages are simply loans made to a homeowner against the property's
equity. The money can be released in one lump sum or in multiple payments, and
is repaid when the property is sold or refinanced by the borrower's heirs after
he or she dies.</P>
      <P>The sale/leaseback option would allow the elderly to sell their homes to
insurance firms, which in turn offer the seniors annuities based on the value of
their properties while still allowing them to reside in their own homes as
tenants.</P>
      <P>The government is interested in launching both products on a trial basis next
year to give more income options to seniors, but Chang also said special
legislation would also be required to reconcile the schemes with existing law.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has the second fastest aging population in the world behind Japan. At
present, people aged over 65 make up 10 percent of the country's population. By
around 2020, the aged population is expected to reach 20 percent in Taiwan,
according to a recent report.</P>

      <P>A group of farmers who are opposed to the acquisition of their farmland by the
Miaoli County Government for a science park project agreed Tuesday during a
mediation meeting with Premier Wu Deng-yi to consider a land swap.</P>
      <P>Wu proposed that the farmers be allowed to keep their residential properties but
turn over their farmlands to the county government in return for similar size
plots in an area designated for farming in the science park.</P>
      <P>Government Information Office Minister Johnny Chi-chen Chiang, who was at the
meeting, said afterward that the Miaoli County Government agreed to allow those
farmers who do not want cash compensation to keep their residential property.</P>
      <P>However, their farmlands will be acquired by the county and they will be given
similar size plots inside the proposed science park, Chiang said. The Miaoli
County Government will help them to build irrigation systems that would make the
land more arable, he added.</P>
      <P>Attorney Chan Shun-gui, who represented the farmers at the meeting, said the
proposal is worth considering and he promised to consult with the farmers at a
meeting on Aug. 22 and give the premier an answer next week.</P>
      <P>The dispute arose from the Miaoli County Government's decision in 2004 to
acquire 28 hectares of farmland to expand the Jhunan Science Park, which is a
branch of the Hsinchu Science Park.</P>
      <P>Some of the farmers who objected to the acquisition plan staged an overnight
protest Aug. 6 in front of the Presidential Office in Taipei after the local
government used bulldozers to level the crops on their farmland.</P>
      <P>The protest prompted Wu to step in -- a move that was seen an effort to avert a
political storm.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Flat panel maker Chimei Innolux Corp. ranked the top TV panel supplier in China
for the second quarter of this year, grabbing a 23 percent market share in terms
of sales volume, according to a report published Tuesday by WitsView, a Taiwan-
based industrial research institute.</P>
      <P>The report attributed the company's strong showing to its efforts to "devote
itself to long-term business in China."</P>
      <P>AU Optronics, another Taiwanese firm, and Samsung Electronics of South Korea,
took the tied No. 2 position, taking a 22 percent share of the China market in
the past quarter, while LG Display (LGD) of South Korea accounted for 19 percent
of the China market to become the fourth-largest supplier, the report said.</P>
      <P>The four suppliers from Taiwan and South Korea accounted for a total of 88
percent of China's TV panel market, according to the report.</P>
      <P>"In recent years, China has become the single market that has demonstrated the
most rapid growth in TV panel demand, " the WitsView report said.</P>
      <P>"Major global panel makers consider China to be the key market, and gaining a
foothold in this market will ensure a more effective panel outlet," it added.</P>
      <P>In terms of region, Taiwanese flat panel makers accounted for 50 percent of
China's total TV panel sales in the second quarter, followed  by South Korea's
42 percent.  Japanese  and Chinese manufacturers shared the remaining 8 percent.</P>
      <P>"There are fewer cultural and language barriers between Taiwan and China, which
has benefited the bilateral collaboration, " the report said.</P>
      <P>The research institute said the government's policy of allowing local panel
makers to set up back-end product assembly bases in China has made Taiwanese
firms competitive in the China market.</P>
      <P>In February,  the  Taiwanese  authorities  further  relaxed restrictions to
allow local firms to set up no more than three sixth- generation or above flat
panel plants in China as long as they can ensure a technology lead over China
and promise to continue investing in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>AU Optronics is seeking regulatory approval to set up a US$3 billion flat panel
plant in Kunshan, in China's Jiangsu Province.</P>
      <P>As for aggregate flat panel shipment by screen area, LGD ranked the largest
supplier in China, taking a 24 percent of the market, as 42-inch or larger
panels make up a large portion of the company's shipments.</P>
      <P>The market share of Chimei Innolux, AU Optronics and Samsung ranged between 21
percent and 23 percent in terms of panel area.</P>
      <P>WitsView said flat panel firms in South Korea have gained an advantage in
competition by frequently launching new products, such as LED TV panels and
large panels of 42 inches or larger.</P>

      <P>Over 70 musicians and groups are expected to show up for the third annual
Hengchun International Folk Song and Musical Festival to be held Aug. 21-29, to
perform an array of traditional tunes during the event, the Council of Cultural
Affairs (CCA) announced Tuesday.</P>
      <P>According to CCA Minister Emile Chihjen Sheng, the festival is one of the
biggest music events in Taiwan and its purpose is to "pass on the heritage of
folk songs for posterity."</P>
      <P>"No matter what your voice is like, it will always sound beautiful as long as
you are singing the traditional folk songs that tell stories of your own
culture," he said.</P>
      <P>This year, groups from Greece, Switzerland, Nepal, Thailand, South Korea and the
Philippines will also be featured at the festival.</P>
      <P>One of the major highlights of the event is a performance by 84 year-old
Taiwanese man Chu Ting-shun, a Golden Melody Award winner for his compilation of
famous Hoklo traditional folk songs such as "Nostalgia" and "Spring Eternal."</P>
      <P>"Taiwanese traditional songs are very beautiful and it will be a pity if this
wonderful culture slowly disappears, " said Chu, who added that he is happy that
his 10-year-old great-grandson has proved to be eager to learn the art.</P>
      <P>Located in southern Pingtung County, the Hengchun Peninsula is one of the first
places the early arrivals to Taiwan settled and is often dubbed the gateway to
the Kenting National Park. The place is rich with Taiwanese, Hakka and

      <P>Visiting Guangdong Provincial Governor Huang Huahua called Tuesday for in-depth
cooperation between Taiwan and his province in various fields, from industry to
tourism.</P>
      <P>Huang, heading a delegation of more than 1,000 members, spelled out the call at
a grand opening ceremony for a "Taiwan-Guangdong Week" at the Taipei
International Convention Center.</P>
      <P>More than 3,000 leaders and representatives of the political and business
sectors on the two sides of the Taiwan Strait attended the ceremony, including
Wu Poh-hsiung, an honorary chairman of the ruling Kuomintang, and Taiwan
External Trade Development Council (TAITRA) Chairman Wang Chih-kang.</P>
      <P>In his address, Huang touted the week-long event held to enhance bilateral
cooperation as the first of its kind since Taiwan and China signed a landmark
economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) in late June, describing it as
the "first wind blowing from the east" since the ECFA and saying that it opens a
new era of economic, trade and cultural links between Taiwan and Guangdong.</P>
      <P>Addressing Guangdong's efforts to streamline trade and mutual investment between
the two sides, Huang invited Taiwanese tourism and culture promotion
associations to open offices in his province to promote Taiwan tourism.</P>
      <P>He also proposed strengthening cooperation in the cross-strait LED and electric
automobile manufacturing industries, as well as in the agricultural sector.</P>
      <P>Wu for his part expressed thanks for the help provided to Taiwanese businessmen
operating in the southern Chinese province to tide them over the global
financial storm and said evidence shows that cross-strait exchanges played a key
role in helping Taiwan to survive the crisis.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan-Guangdong Week, described by the organizers as a "journey of
cooperation and nostalgia, " hopes to underline the importance of cross-strait
strategic economic, agricultural and tourism  cooperation  with a variety of
activities,  including investment and procurement workshops and conferences on
technological and agricultural cooperation.</P>
      <P>Also at the opening ceremony, Wang said that the Chinese delegation will
purchase more than US$6.6 billion-worth of products while in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>As one of the purposes of Huang's visit is to invite Taiwanese people to travel
to Guangdong for the upcoming 2010 Asian Games and Asian Para Games, he said he
will present 11,000 entrance tickets for the events to Taiwanese people.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan closely monitoring China's military build-up: MND</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>In the wake of a U.S. Pentagon report that stated China's military build-up
opposite Taiwan has "continued unabated" despite warming cross-strait relations,
the Ministry of National Defense said Tuesday it has been closely monitoring the
situation.</P>
      <P>"The public has no need to worry," said military spokesman Yu Sy- tue</P>
      <P>The Pentagon, in a report released Monday on China's military development, said
that China is expanding its military advantages over Taiwan, and is increasingly
looking at areas beyond the island.</P>
      <P>"The balance of cross-Strait military forces continues to shift in the
mainland's favor," the report said.</P>
      <P>In response, Lin Yu-fang, a convener of the Legislative Yuan's National Defense
and Foreign Affairs Committee said there is no need for the public to be "overly
nervous" as the possibility of a cross-strait conflict is very slim, given the
stable relations between Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>On the matter of an increasing military imbalance in favor of China, Lin said
that Taiwan's small land area makes it impossible for China to deploy all of its
forces in the coastal provinces of Fujian and Guangdong opposite Taiwan in
preparation for a possible war.</P>
      <P>"From a regional perspective, a relative balance is maintained to some extent,"
Lin said.</P>
      <P>Since the administration of U.S. President Barack Obama took office, it has not
approved any new arms sales to Taiwan, Lin said, adding that Taiwan would be
forced to develop guided missiles or cruise missiles with longer range if
Washington continues to stall on selling Taiwan more advanced weapons.</P>
      <P>"The U.S. should seriously consider whether it would let Taiwan to go its own
way," he said.</P>
      <P>In January, the U.S. announced its intent to sell US$6.4 billion worth of
defensive arms to Taiwan -- a package that was approved by the administration of
former President George W. Bush.</P>
      <P>Wong Ming-hsien,  director of Tamkang University's Graduate Institute of
International Affairs and Strategic Studies (GIIASS) , said that China has made
several strategic moves over the past year, going back and forth between the
first and second island chains in the Pacific ocean.</P>
      <P>He cited as examples China's naval advance from the Pacific to Indian ocean to
deter pirates in the Gulf of Aden and its attempts to build aircraft carriers.</P>
      <P>The latest Pentagon report indicates that the U.S. is trying to deal
comprehensively with China rising power by offering an analysis of the security
situation in the region, Wong said. He urged that Washington adopt a new
strategy toward Asia as China's rise is becoming a reality.</P>
      <P>For Taiwan's part, it is definitely necessary to build a self-sufficient
national defense and to show determination for self-defence, which will give the
country greater bargaining power in its increasing exchanges with China, he
said.</P>
      <P>Former chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council and top Taiwan envoy to the U.S.
Joseph Wu said that the report points to the fact that in spite of improved
cross-strait ties, China has never abandoned its attempt (to take Taiwan by
force.)</P>
      <P>However, GIIASS professor Wang Kao-chen suggested that Taiwan take a two-pronged
approach to the problem.</P>
      <P>Taiwan should build its missile-defense capability and at the same time try to
convince Beijing that its military deployment will only make the Taiwan people
more bitter against China, he said.</P>
      <P>He further advised that Taiwan take a neutral stand in the latest row between
the U.S. and China over right of access in the South China Sea and the situation
on the Korean Peninsula.</P>
      <P>Any involvement by Taiwan in these issues would be detrimental, both in terms of
Taiwan's national security and its economic development, he said.</P>

      <P>Researchers at the Industrial Technology Research Institute in Hsinchu City have
developed a computerized system that can help track the movement of vehicles on
roads, an institute official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Hsieh Hsi-hsing, deputy chief of the institute's Identification and Security
Technology Center told a news conference that the current way of reconstructing
the movement of a vehicle is by watching videotapes  recorded by security
cameras installed at intersections.</P>
      <P>Only after discovering when and where the target vehicle appears on the video
tapes can the vehicle's route be mapped out, which is time-consuming and liable
to errors, Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>In the new system developed by the institute, a computer can replace the humans
needed to review the tapes.</P>
      <P>The system transforms the features of the vehicle, including its color, plate
number -- even only a few letters of the plate -- the vehicle type and other
vital information into digital data and then examines the tapes for similar
vehicles.</P>
      <P>It is much quicker and more exact than screening performed by people, Hsieh
said.</P>
      <P>The system can work with the existing security camera system, Hsieh added.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Tuesday that a planned bridge linking outlying
Kinmen Island with the neighboring islet of Little Kinmen is expected to become
a new sightseeing spot and bring prosperity to Little Kinmen.</P>
      <P>The proposal to build the bridge was passed by the Executive Yuan in February
and the plan has been closely watched, as the bridge will make a much-discussed
bridge between Taiwanese territory and China more feasible because Little Kinmen
is even closer to China than Kinmen, lying just about five kilometers off the
Chinese coast.</P>
      <P>The construction of the bridge is expected to start by the end of this year, and
the structure will not only become a landmark but will also serve as a platform
for linking public utility lines, Ma said while meeting representatives from the
islands of Kinmen and Matsu at the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih said Aug. 15 that the government is clearing mines on the
outlying islands and hopes to begin building the 5.3-km bridge by the end of
this year at the earliest.</P>
      <P>The estimated  cost of the project is about NT$5 billion (US$156.56 million) ,
two-thirds of which will come from the central government,  with the remaining
third from the Kinmen county government, Wu said.</P>
      <P>According to the government's plan, the bridge is expected to be completed in
2015.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Ma also said that while purchasing new boats for a ferry service
between northern Taiwan's Keelung and Matsu, the government should consider
whether the new ferries can help boost local tourism.</P>
      <P>Some local residents had suggested that the government should buy trimaran fast
ferries from abroad to save travel time, but Ma said the government wants to
purchase locally manufactured vessels.</P>

year growth of nearly 50 percent in online advertisement revenues for the first
half of 2010.</P>
      <P>"Google Taiwan's advertisement sales rose 48 percent in the first half of this
year compared with the same period last year, " the company's general manager
Chien Lee-feng said at a press briefing.</P>
      <P>"This also means that Taiwan is one of Google's fastest-growing markets in

      <P>Citing figures from the Taipei Internet Advertising and Media Association (IAMA)
, Chien noted that Google's revenue growth was higher than the projected 12.76
percent for Taiwan's entire online advertisement market this year.</P>
      <P>In a press statement, Google Taiwan attributed its high growth rate to growing
demand for keyword-search advertising as Taiwan's export-reliant economy
recovers.</P>

medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).</P>
      <P>"We are working with agents in various specialized fields, who will teach
domestic SMEs how to market online," Chien said in a press statement.</P>
      <P>Google is already Taiwan's largest online advertisement network -- it has
partnerships with more than 20,000 online content providers and reaches 97
percent of local Internet users, Chien said.</P>
      <P>In the statement, G.T. General Manager Cheng Born-win said that the majority of
SMEs companies in Taiwan are unfamiliar with online marketing or have not used
it effectively.</P>
      <P>"As a result, they miss many overseas business opportunities," he said.</P>

      <P>The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) announced three new cases of indigenous
dengue fever Monday, two of which were contracted from the original patient.</P>
      <P>According to CDC officials, a 41-year-old female living in Tainan County's
Guanmiao Township began experiencing flu-like symptoms and was diagnosed as
suffering from flu Aug. 9.</P>
      <P>CDC said that three days later, she developed diarrhea, nausea, and blood in her
urine and stool. On Aug. 13th, the medical center she attended reported her to
the CDC, which confirmed her as a type 1 dengue patient.</P>
      <P>An immediate investigation into the patient's surroundings was conducted by the
Tainan County Health Bureau to see if there had been any disease transmission.</P>
      <P>Blood tests on a neighbor and a man who works in the same shop as the patient
showed positive for dengue fever, said CDC Deputy Director-General Chou Chih-

      <P>Both the original patient and her co-worker had consulted doctors who failed to
diagnose them, said Chou, urging doctors to be on the alert for dengue cases.</P>
      <P>Six family members and four other co-workers of the original patient showed no
dengue fever symptoms.</P>
      <P>According to the CDC, there have been 15 cases of indigenous dengue fever since
March, and Chou said the peak season for the disease this year might begin
earlier than usual.</P>
      <P>CDC officials urged the public to clean up mosquito breeding sites around their
residences as the most effective means of preventing  transmission  of the
disease,  adding that further information can be obtained on the Communicable

    <TEXT>
      <P>A total of 38 candidates had registered by Tuesday's deadline to run for 32
seats on the ruling Kuomintang's (KMT's) decision-making arm, the Central
Standing Committee.</P>
      <P>The candidates' qualifications will be examined over the next two days and those
eligible  will be announced  Thursday,  while ballot-casting day is set for
Sept. 18, according to a schedule announced by the party.</P>
      <P>All of the 32 incumbent committee members except for Legislator Huang Chao-hsun
and Sean Lien, the son of KMT Honorary Chairman Lien Chan, are seeking re-
election,</P>
      <P>Notable among the newcomers who threw their hats into the ring are legislators
Chou Yi, Wu Yu-sheng and Lu Hsueh-chang.</P>
      <P>KMT Secretary-General King Pu-tsung ascribed the relatively fewer candidates for
the committee to the fact that the member's term is only one year.</P>
      <P>"Some have suggested extending the term by one more year, which is something we
might contemplate in the future," King said.</P>
      <P>He denied that party members are not enthusiastic about sitting on the committee
because of its diminishing role in shaping national policy, saying that the
committee is more an advisor to the government than a policymaker.</P>
      <P>"I myself stick to my role as a mirror that reflects public opinion on national
issues," he added.</P>
      <P>In addition to the 32 elected members, the committee has another five members
appointed by the party chairman, and two members reserved for the party's youth
wing.</P>

      <P>A total of 409 households out of 482 in a community in Taipei County's Sijhih
have received compensation, 13 years after their houses were damaged by a
landslide triggered by Typhoon Winnie.</P>
      <P>A statement issued Tuesday by the Taipei county government said that almost 90
percent of the NT$100 million (US$3.13 million) compensation had already been
claimed by the victims.</P>
      <P>The mudslide knocked down 200 apartments in the Lincoln Community and badly
damaged 282 others, killing 28 people and injuring 50 .</P>
      <P>As the real estate developer who built the community was unable to compensate
the residents, the house owners demanded that the local government should pay,
arguing that it shared the blame by permitting the developer to build apartments
on a slide-prone hillside.</P>
      <P>Various candidates who ran for county magistrate since that 1997 disaster had
promised to help the dwellers to claim national compensation in attempts to win
their votes.</P>
      <P>The county government was eventually able to earmark NT$137.77 million as
compensation for the affected residents, according to the county government.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A war of words erupted Tuesday after the opposition  Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP)  questioned the government's intention not to write into law a
promise that Chinese students will not be allowed to work while studying in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>DPP spokesman Lin Yu-chang argued in a statement that without the proposed law,
Taiwan will be opening its doors to Chinese laborers "in an alternative way."</P>
      <P>Citing examples in other countries that admit Chinese students to their higher
education institutions, Lin said the percentage of Chinese students who work
illegally is "very high."</P>
      <P>In response to the DPP's insistence on listing the prohibition in the University
Act, Legislator Lin Yi-shih of the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) , who is also chief
executive of the party' Central Policy Committee, said there is no need to do so
because the existing laws already stipulate the ban.</P>
      <P>Lin pointed out that the Act Governing the Relations between the People of the
Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area contains an article banning Chinese permitted
to enter Taiwan from conducting activities inconsistent with the purpose of
their stays.</P>
      <P>The DPP, however, accused the Ma Ying-jeou administration of attempting to relax
the restriction through the Employment Services Act, which treats Chinese
students enrolled in local schools as any other foreign students, who are
allowed to work for a maximum of 16 hours per week during semesters.</P>
      <P>The limitation on working hours does not include summer and winter breaks.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Kuan Bi-ling said that allowing Chinese students to work will
affect part-time job opportunities for local students.</P>
      <P>"Allowing 8,000 Chinese students to work would lead to the joblessness of 4,286
Taiwanese people, and the unemployment rate among local people aged between 20
and 24 would increase to 15.25 percent, " said DPP Legislator Lin Shu-fen at a
press conference held earlier in the day by the DPP legislative caucus.</P>
      <P>The disputes arose after Kuan accused the Presidential Office the previous day
of intervening in talks between lawmakers of the ruling and opposition parties
on three Ministry of Education-initiated packages of legal amendments to pave
the way for the admission of Chinese students to local tertiary education
institutions.</P>
      <P>Kuan accused the office of overthrowing an agreement between the ruling and
opposition camps to write into law the proposal to ban Chinese student from
working while studying.</P>
      <P>The Presidential Office denied the allegation.</P>
      <P>The DPP is strongly opposed to the idea of opening Taiwan's doors to Chinese
students out of fear that they might displace local students and workers.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>According to an annual report released Monday by the U.S. Department of Defense,
the balance of cross-Taiwan Strait military forces continues to shift in China's
favor despite closer economic and cultural exchanges.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's "window of vulnerability" is tempting an invasion by the other side. If
it were not for an "international gendarme, " China could take over Taiwan right
now.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has become a watershed in the fight for East Asian supremacy between the
United States and China. China's seizure of Taiwan would symbolize U.S inability
to protect Taiwan and East Asia.</P>
      <P>Ironically, because of mutual economic dependence with China, the United States
is not willing to sell advanced weapons to Taiwan and offend China, fearing
economic retaliation from Beijing.</P>
      <P>This is why the United States would rather adopt a psychological warfare posture
of "strategic ambiguity, " in which the uncertainty over the U.S. response
deters China from invading Taiwan.</P>
      <P>With its technological strength,  Taiwan should manufacture weapons such as
submarines, cruise missiles and unmanned combat aerial vehicles on its own.
Taiwan already has an excellent foundation for a defense industry, and the
military should now share its defense technology with the private sector to
produce weapons for its own defense needs. (Editorial abstract -- Aug. 18, 2010)</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A new U.S. Pentagon report on China's military buildup indicated that the
military imbalance between China and Taiwan is widening, threatening stability
in the region.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from local media coverage of the issue:</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>The U.S. Pentagon's just-released report on military and security developments
involving China said that by December 2009, the People's Liberation  Army (PLA)
had deployed  between 1,050 and 1,150 short-range ballistic missiles targeted at
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>However, local news media cited a Ministry of National Defense (MND) magazine
report in July as estimating that the number of Chinese short-range missiles
targeting Taiwan will reach 1,960 by the end of this year.</P>
      <P>Asked about the difference, a defense ministry official said Tuesday the
research report carried in an MND academic publication in July only reflected
the author's personal projection,  not an authentic intelligence report.</P>
      <P>According to the MND's 2009 National Defense Report, the PLA had deployed about
1,300 various types of short-range missiles and cruise missiles by the end of
2009. "This estimate was roughly same as the Pentagon's figure," the MND
official added.</P>
      <P>He further said the MND was not surprised by the content of the newly released
Pentagon report which concludes that despite President Ma Ying-jeou's efforts to
increase economic and cultural ties, China's military buildup continues
unabated.</P>
      <P>According to the official,  Taiwan was a major source of intelligence and a
consultative partner in the U.S. study on China's military strength. (Aug. 18,
2010).</P>
      <P>Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>The Pentagon report released Monday said China is extending its military
advantage over Taiwan and increasingly looking beyond, building up a force with
the power to strike in Asia as far away as the U.S. territory of Guam.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that Beijing is rapidly expanding its armed forces to "deter, delay
or deny" any possible U.S. support for Taiwan in case of a conflict, the report
said the balance of cross-strait military forces continues to shift in China's
favor.</P>
      <P>The report further said the PLA is upgrading the lethality of the force deployed
against Taiwan, including by introducing variants of its CSS-6 and CSS-7
missiles with improved ranges, accuracies and payloads.</P>
      <P>Responding to the U.S. report, MND spokesman Yu Sy-tue said Tuesday the
government is fully aware that China has not given up its intention to use force

      <P>With its shipbuilding technology advancing swiftly and increasing assistance
from abroad, China is likely to begin building its first aircraft carrier before
the end of this year, far ahead of the 2016 timeline previously forecast by some
U.S. experts, the Pentagon report said.</P>
      <P>China is also expected to build several more aircraft carriers and auxiliary
warships in the next 10 years, the report said, adding that some of China's
aircraft carriers will be commissioned into service during the period.</P>
      <P>According to the report, Brazil will assist China in training its pilots to fly
warplanes aboard aircraft carriers. Moreover, it said, China intends to procure
50 Su-33 warplanes to be posted on aircraft carriers for an estimated US$2.5
billion. However, negotiations for the deal have stalled due to China's alleged
copying of Su-27 jet fighters without Russia's consent, the report said. (Aug.

    <TEXT>
      <P>Among the tax reforms promoted by the administration of President Ma Ying-jeou,
cutting gift and estate tax rates to 10 percent and the corporate income tax
rate to 17 percent have drawn the most attention. Both policies are aimed at
attracting foreign capital inflows.</P>
      <P>Under Taiwan's consolidated income tax system, however, dividends are treated as
part of an individual's taxable income, which can be taxed at rates of up to 40
percent.</P>
      <P>Hong Kong and Singapore also have consolidated income tax systems, but they
exempt dividends from income tax. The individual income tax rates are 20 percent
in Singapore and 16.5 percent in Hong Kong. While Hong Kong does not impose an
estate tax, a 10 percent estate tax rate is levied by both Taiwan and Singapore.</P>
      <P>In the eyes of foreign investors, both Singapore and Hong Kong provide friendly
tax systems. Taiwan needs to work harder to reform its tax system in order to
catch the eyes of foreign investors.</P>
      <P>Trade liberalization  has stirred  up a world war on tax competitiveness, a
situation that Taiwan should not take lightly. Whether the tax system is a
bellwether or a stumbling block only involves a change in the government's
mindset. (Editorial abstract -- Aug. 18, 2010)</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Local residents continued their blockade of an access road to Formosa Plastic
Group's (FPG) petrochemical complex in Yunlin County Wednesday morning,
disrupting traffic, but they later dispersed after venting their anger.</P>
      <P>Led by a resident self-help association, the protesters used their bodies and
cars to block traffic, causing traffic jams stretching about three kilometers.</P>
      <P>On Tuesday, angry residents blocked all three major roads leading to the
complex, demanding that the conglomerate pay residents NT$1.8 billion (US$53
million) for polluting the area and harming their health. They also wanted
Formosa Plastics to promise to relocate the complex later this decade.</P>
      <P>The company said it is only willing to pay as much as NT$500 million.</P>
      <P>On Wednesday morning, the association again mobilized local residents to cut off
one of the three main roads.</P>
      <P>With the blockade taking place during working hours, many workers at the complex
complained that the protesters were infringing on their right to work.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Formosa Plastics' management called on the protesters to respect its
employees' right to work, and it began adopting flexible work schedules.</P>
      <P>But the disruption did not affect the company's production line or supply chain,
with only 30 of the 400 oil tankers that pass through the complex daily being
obstructed, company executives said.</P>
      <P>In the chaos, police used patrol vehicles to clear a lane for traffic.</P>
      <P>At the same time, some protesters gathered on another road leading to the front
gate of the complex, prompting police officers to form a human wall to prevent
workers at the complex from being disturbed.</P>
      <P>After venting their anger, the protesters dispersed at around 8: 20 a.m. but
threatened to initiate another blockade of the three main access roads during
work hours on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Formosa Plastics called for rational and peaceful communications and stressed
that the company would go no higher than the NT$500 million in overall
compensation it has offered, which represented an increase from the original
NT$450 million it proposed.</P>
      <P>Residents have pressed Formosa Plastics for compensation after a major fire at
one of the complex's oil refining plants broke out on July 25 and contaminated
neighboring farms and fish farms. It was the second fire at the complex in three
weeks.</P>
      <P>Residents of Mailiao Township and other nearby villages accused the plant of
having poor safety precautions and of neglecting the potential health risks to
local residents.</P>

      <P>The first-ever food security forum of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
(APEC) opened in Taipei Wednesday, hoping to develop an action plan by the end
of the three-day meeting, Taiwan's top agriculture officials said.</P>
      <P>The forum will launch a discussion on establishing a regional food security
mechanism, a pressing issue in light of climate change, said Chen Wu-hsiung, the
head of the Council of Agriculture (COA) , which organized the forum.</P>
      <P>The initiative was submitted by Taiwan, which uses the name of Chinese  Taipei
in APEC,  in the APEC Agricultural  Technical Cooperation Working Group last
year, Chen said.</P>
      <P>APEC is a forum for 21 Pacific Rim Member Economies to cooperate on regional
trade and investment liberalization and facilitation. According to the COA, 95
delegates from 20 economies are attending the three-day meeting that ends Aug.
20.</P>
      <P>With respect to Taiwan's food security, Chen said the government is paying
attention to the issue and has developed a complete strategic plan to tackle the
problem.</P>
      <P>The plan involves building safety stocks, combating climate change, improving
agricultural production efficiency, and forging sustainable agricultural
development, he said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has increased its annual stock of rice -- Taiwan's food staple -- from
300,000 tons to 430,000 tons, Chen said. Although Taiwan is only 30 percent
self-sufficient in grains, the domestic supply of rice has been stable and most
of Taiwan's food imports are grass crops.</P>
      <P>The COA has been working on revitalizing fallow land and has successfully
replanted 20,000 hectares of the 220,000 hectares of idle farmland in the
country, according to Chen.</P>
      <P>The ministry also plans to restructure the agricultural sector to focus more on
producing field corn and lower-quality rice that can be grown quickly in large
quantities in case of a food shortage.</P>
      <P>"High-quality rice is already abundant in Taiwan," Chen said.</P>

      <P>A government survey asking 3,000 manufacturers about a recently signed trade
pact with China found that most respondents said the trade pact is more
beneficial than harmful, a Ministry of Economic Affairs official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The ministry is scheduled to release the results of the poll on Thursday,
following  the Legislative  Yuan's approval  of the controversial trade pact
late Tuesday.</P>
      <P>It was the first official poll to ask local businesses about the effects of the
economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) signed on June 29. The poll,
conducted in July, asked manufacturers about the trade pact's likely impact on
their revenues, imports, exports and investments.</P>
      <P>According to the official, the poll found that only industries focusing on
domestic demand -- such as apparel, clothing accessories and food -- said they
would be hurt by the ECFA, which is expected to take effect on both sides of the
Taiwan Strait in September.</P>
      <P>Under the ECFA's "early harvest" program, the tariffs on 539 Taiwanese goods and
267 Chinese products will be reduced to zero within two years after the pact
takes effect.</P>
      <P>Some manufacturers  in petrochemicals,  machine  tools  and automobile-related
industries that were not included in the early harvest list said in the survey
that the government should start the next round of trade negotiations with China
as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>The Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) will
conduct a decennial population and housing census from Dec. 26, 2010 to Jan. 22,
2011, the agency said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The census will be carried out based on registration data and sample surveys,
with 1.3 million households and 4.5 million people polled, according to the
agency.</P>
      <P>DGBAS Minister Shih Su-mei held a meeting attended by more than 100 officials
Wednesday to discussion preparations for the census.</P>
      <P>According to the Statistics Act, the DGBAS is responsible for conducting the
census every 10 years. The 2010-2011 census will be the sixth population and
housing census since the Republic of China government moved to Taiwan in 1949,
the agency said. Censuses were conducted in 1956,1966, 1980, 1990 and 2000.</P>
      <P>All local governments will set up task forces in September to visit households
during the census period. An estimated 17,000 people are expected to take part
in the work.</P>
      <P>Facing increased costs and low interest in being interviewed among the general
public, some countries, including Singapore and Germany, have adopted a
combination of registration-based census and sample surveys, rather than
attempting to account for every member of the public.</P>
      <P>After taking census trends into account, the Executive Yuan approved a proposal
earlier this month to adopt the alternative census approach based on population

      <P>Guangzhou will host the 16th Asian Games and 19th Asian Para Games Nov. 12-27,

      <P>Taiwan share prices closed little changed Wednesday after profit-taking emerged,
focusing on textile, food and transport stocks, to reverse early gains on Wall
Street's recovery overnight, dealers said.</P>
      <P>The weighted index fell 6.99 points or 0.08 percent to 7,924.10, after moving
between 7,897.18 and 7,983.76, on turnover of NT$134.55 billion (US$4.21
billion).</P>
      <P>The market opened up 0.60 percent after Wall Street staged a one percent rebound
overnight, and moved to the day's high before investors locked in recent gains
-- especially in the old economy sector -- amid hopes that the local economy
would benefit from increasing cross-strait business, dealers said.</P>
      <P>A total of 2,204 stocks closed down and 1,495 up, with 363 remaining unchanged.</P>
      <P>The textile sector suffered the heaviest losses, down 1.2 percent. Foodstuffs

0.1 percent.</P>
      <P>The construction sector rose 2.0 percent and the paper and pulp sector gained

stocks added 0.1 percent.</P>
      <P>"Technical resistance ahead of the key 8,000 point level remained strong, " Mega

      <P>Huang said that while Narayana Kocherlakota, head of the U.S. Federal Reserve

"unwarranted" on Tuesday, his words failed fo lend much support to the local
bourse, although U.S. markets rebounded.</P>
      <P>"There is so much conflicting information about the economic climate, " Huang
said. "It's hard for investors to paint a clear picture of it."</P>
      <P>Huang said a weaker high-tech sector was evidence that worries over global
demand in the second half of this year still weighed on the market.</P>
      <P>"I expect the local market will continue to trade in a narrow range. Further
consolidation is needed before the index holds itself well above 8,000 points,"
Huang said.</P>

and Yang Ming Marine fell 5.87 percent to NT$20.85.</P>
      <P>However, the construction sector bucked the downturn on hopes that inflow from

      <P>A Chinese civil aviation delegation will arrive in Taiwan late this month to
attend a seminar on issues regarding the certification of aircraft
airworthiness, an official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The delegation will be headed by Li Jian, deputy director of the General
Administration of Civil Aviation of China, said the official from Taiwan's Civil
Aeronautics Administration (CAA).</P>
      <P>At the behest of the CAA, the Taipei Airlines Association has joined China's
Cross-Strait Aviation Transport Exchange Council in organizing the seminar on
aircraft airworthiness issues, which, in the case of Taiwan and China, have
proven difficult because of sovereignty disputes.</P>
      <P>As aircraft are seen as an extension of national territory, countries  that
maintain aviation agreements  tend to mutually authorize their licensed aircraft
maintenance engineers to inspect aircraft from the other country and certify
their airworthiness.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and China, however, have avoided touching on aircraft airworthiness
issues since they forged direct air links roughly two years ago because such
themes involve sensitive statehood recognition issues.</P>
      <P>The mutual certification of spare parts, maintenance engineers and maintenance
facilities has proven thorny because the relevant certificates  bear national
titles and the issuance  of such certificates involve the exercise of public
authority.</P>
      <P>That has led to inconvenience for carriers from the two sides and increased
their operating costs because they have to stock spare parts  and components  on
each  cross-strait  flight  to meet contingencies.</P>
      <P>Most Chinese carriers have posted licensed aircraft maintenance engineers at
Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport, while Taiwanese carriers tend to station
maintenance personnel at the Beijing and Shanghai airports to conduct
airworthiness inspections.</P>
      <P>They also have to assign licensed maintenance engineers on each flight to less
frequently served destinations to inspect and maintain the aircraft upon
arrival.</P>
      <P>Although the Taiwanese and Chinese officials have met many times to discuss
flight increase issues, they have never touched on airworthiness topics because
of the sensitivity of the issue.</P>
      <P>The CAA official said the upcoming seminar will mainly provide a forum for both
sides to express their opinions and views on relevant issues.</P>
      <P>"The forum will not be an occasion for negotiating airworthiness issues, " the
official said, adding that the CAA hopes to know more about China's opinions and
stances to pave the way for future talks.</P>
      <P>According to airline sources, China once suggested that the Taipei Airlines
Association and the Beijing-based Cross-Strait Aviation Transport Exchange
Council be authorized to issue certificates of airworthiness. However, Taiwan
has so far not yet accepted such a proposal.</P>
      <P>The CAA reportedly has informed the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Office (MAC)
of Beijing's proposal. The country's top China policy planning body has not yet

      <P>The Kuomintang's (KMT's) Kaohsiung mayoral candidate Huang Chao-shun will travel
to Singapore at the end of August to learn from the city state's development
experience, her economic consultant Ma Kai said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Huang, accompanied by a group of specialists, will visit places such as
Singapore's airport and harbors to study the country's economic development and
infrastructure, Ma said.</P>
      <P>The delegation, composed of professionals from various fields, envisions the

    <TEXT>
      <P>A mutual fund company in Hong Kong Wednesday recommended investors buy Taiwanese
funds to capitalize on Taiwan's growth potential after the cross-Taiwan Strait
economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) takes effect.</P>
      <P>In an article published in the Wen Wei Po daily, Pegasus Fund Managers suggested
that investors put out their feelers by buying into Taiwan funds. If there is
further progress in Taiwan's effort to sign free trade agreement (FTAs) with
other countries, investors can increase their purchases for long-term
investment, the company said.</P>
      <P>It predicted that the passage of the ECFA by Taiwan's Legislative Yuan will
boost the chance for the stock index to challenge the 9,000-point mark by the
end of this year.</P>
      <P>The company also pointed out that experts from Taiwan and China will meet in the
city of Guilin in China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region in early September to
discuss post-ECFA economic ties and likely raise the issue of Taiwan's FTA bids.</P>
      <P>The company noted that Taiwan opened its door to Chinese tourists before the
conclusion of the ECFA.</P>
      <P>In the first half of this year, the daily arrivals of Chinese tourists averaged
3,440, more than double the same period last year, when the average arrivals
were 1,661, the company said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) Chairman Huang Kun-huei said Wednesday
that the party has decided to push for a national referendum on a controversial
trade pact with China for a third time.</P>
      <P>During a luncheon with pro-independence groups, Huang contended that the
economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) ratified by the Legislative
Yuan late Tuesday will mostly benefit a few businesses at the expense of the
majority of Taiwan's people.</P>
      <P>He also predicted that the existing ban on certain Chinese agricultural products
and all Chinese workers will soon be lifted, which he said would have a negative
impact on local citizens.</P>
      <P>The government has adamantly denied that it would ease the twin bans as it
liberalizes trade with China.</P>
      <P>Huang complained that although the people have a constitutional right to hold
referendums, the Executive Yuan's Referendum Review Committee has twice rejected
the TSU's ECFA referendum initiative on technical grounds.</P>
      <P>The party will initiate a new referendum to disband the committee and also start
collecting signatures for a third ECFA referendum proposal, the TSU chairman
said.</P>
      <P>"We want to know to what extent the government will ignore public opinion,"
Huang said.  "Referendums are the last line of defense for Taiwan's democracy.
We will file ECFA proposals as often as they are rejected."</P>
      <P>The third referendum proposal would still ask "Do you agree with the
government's plan to sign a 'Cross-Strait Economic Cooperation Framework
Agreement' with China?" the TSU chairman said.</P>
      <P>Former Vice President Annette Lu, who was also present at the luncheon, accused
the ruling Kuomintang-controlled Legislative Yuan of rushing the bill through,
saying that after the trade pact goes into effect, it could have many adverse
political,  economic, diplomatic and military effects.</P>
      <P>Lu also said there was an immediate need to guide the public on ways to respond
and adapt to the new ECFA era and formulate measures to deal with the deal's
consequences.</P>

      <P>Amid talks among Asia-Pacific economies of establishing  a regional food
security mechanism,  a Taiwanese businessman with operations in China said
Wednesday that the problem of food safety in the Chinese market was worse than
that of food security.</P>
      <P>Food stock in China is enough to meet demand, said Mark Han, chairman and
executive director of DaChan Food (Asia) Ltd., which operates on both sides
across Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Food safety issues, however, put the health of consumers in jeopardy, Han told
reporters at the first food security forum of the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) , which opened in Taipei earlier Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The three-day forum aims to establish a regional security mechanism to protect
against possible food shortages worldwide due to global climate change.</P>
      <P>Han said that the problem of food security -- concerning the safe stock of food
staples in a nation -- is not urgent in the region compared with that of food
safety, and suggested regional economies actively make efforts to build a food
traceability system on the APEC platform.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Minister of Agriculture Chen Wu-hsiung praised the idea of a system to
ensure food safety in the Asia-Pacific region.</P>
      <P>"But it's easier said than done," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Taking Taiwan as an example, Chen said that after years of efforts  the island
still  lags behind  in traceability  and certification of organic products.</P>
      <P>Even in Japan, a developed country with modern agriculture, only 1 percent of
its cropland is certified as organic, Chen said.</P>
      <P>According to the Council of Agriculture, which organized the forum, 95 delegates
from 20 economies are attending the meeting.</P>

      <P>Delta Electronics, Inc. said Wednesday it is in talks with potential buyers on
the use of its projectors at the upcoming Asian Games in China.</P>
      <P>"Delta is capable of developing and producing high definition projectors," said
Delta's deputy spokesman Jesse Chou. "Such high-end projectors are very suitable
for major sports events like the Asian Games."</P>
      <P>"They (the potential buyers) are very interested in Delta's projectors," he
said, but he declined to disclose any further details of the negotiations.</P>
      <P>The Asian Games will be held in November in Guangzhou, Guangdong Province.</P>
      <P>Earlier this year, Delta sold 500 HD projectors to Shanghai for display at the
2010 World Expo and has also shipped more than 1,000 units to some smaller
Chinese cities, cashing in on China's policy of promoting home appliances in its
rural areas.</P>
      <P>Delta launched the world's first 95-inch short throw projector in May. Its new
3D technology was used in the broadcasts of the World Cup in July.</P>
      <P>Earlier Wednesday, Guangdong Provincial Governor Huang Huahua led a delegation
on a visit to Delta where they were given  a demonstration of the company's high
tech products, including HD projectors.</P>
      <P>In a statement, the company said Huang highly praised Delta's technology and
innovation and was impressed by the company's efforts to develop green energy
technology.</P>
      <P>On Tuesday, Delta and the city of Dongguan in Guangdong Province signed a letter
of intent with a focus on a possible order for the company's LED lighting
products.</P>
      <P>At the signing ceremony, Delta said it will continue its efforts in Dongguan to
develop LED lighting and related green energy products.</P>
      <P>Delta currently operates seven plants and one research and development center in
Dongguan, 18 years after it first established a a foothold in the Chinese city.</P>
      <P>During his visit to Delta, Huang said his province will allocate 10 billion
Chinese yuan (US$1.47 billion) for the development of the green energy sector
over the next five years.</P>
      <P>Market analysts said Taiwanese solar energy firms, which have listed China as
the top destination of their exports, are expected to benefit from the green
energy project in Dongguan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Magazine digest -- When will 12-year free education be implemented?</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>The Ministry  of Education  (MOE)
08/18/10  19:55:48
(CommonWealth Parenting 15)(translated by Kay Liu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>has changed its chief 10 times since 1983 when it first proposed extending
compulsory education from nine years to 12 years, but the plan is still on the
drawing board.</P>
      <P>As this is one of the 10 main topics to be discussed at the eighth National
Education Conference Aug. 28-29, everyone is looking to see whether the
government will unveil a timeline for implementing the proposal.</P>
      <P>MOE statistics show that 96 percent of students who complete junior high school
go on to senior high school or vocational school. However, the 12-year
compulsory system is more about making public education free and getting rid of
entrance exams.</P>
      <P>The current compulsory education system, which has been in place since 1968,
covers six years of elementary school and three years of junior high school.</P>
      <P>For the government, implementing a 12-year system would mean additional budget
allocations of tens of billions dollars per year and the amendment of laws --
neither of which are within the MOE's purview.</P>
      <P>But the main obstacles to 12-year compulsory education are a lack of political
will, the uneven quality of high schools, the level of preparedness of junior
high school teachers to make the change, and an obsession among parents with top
senior high schools.</P>
      <P>"Ideally, what all parents want from a 12-year compulsory education system is
for their children to enter top senior high schools which is impossible, " said
Chou Yu-wen, a professor at National Taiwan Normal University's Education
Department.  One solution would be to improve the quality of senior high schools
in general so that there is less focus on rankings that are based on acceptance
scores and public opinion.</P>
      <P>Another challenge is changing the teaching focus in junior high school from
preparing students for senior high school entrance exams to guiding the
development of teenagers. This aspect is not included in the MOE's pilot project
for 12-year compulsory education.</P>
      <P>In its efforts to move toward a 12-year system, the government over the last 10
years has been pushing the idea of a mechanism, other than a single decisive
exam, to move students from junior to senior high school.</P>
      <P>Currently, students either apply or are assigned to a senior high school in
their area based mainly on the results of one of the two academic achievement
tests that they take at the end of the ninth grade.</P>
      <P>But last year, another method was introduced. Students were assessed on the
basis of their overall performance during their three years in junior high
school. Nine percent of students at that level gained entry to senior high
school based on this assessment.</P>
      <P>Chang Ming-wen, head of the MOE's Department of Secondary Education, said an
estimated 60 percent of students nowadays choose schools near their homes
instead of the so-called top schools. This indicates a change in societal
values, which is necessary for the 12-year plan to progress, she said.</P>
      <P>While 12-year compulsory education would not solve all the problems in Taiwan's
education system, it would help take the exam pressure off teenagers in junior
high school and give them a better chance at mature and independent development.
It would also pave the way for further improvement of the education system.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Special Investigation Division (SID) under the Supreme Prosecutors' Office
said Wednesday that it has received an additional US$1.88 million (NT$59.97
million) from overseas accounts held by former President Chen Shui-bian's family
members.</P>
      <P>So far, US$10.4 million out of a total of US$21 million kept by Chen's family
members in Merrill Lynch Bank (Suisse) S.A. and the Royal Bank of Scotland has
been wired to Taiwan bank accounts designated by the SID.</P>
      <P>The money in the Swiss bank accounts, which has been frozen since 2007, was held
by the ex-president's son and daughter-in law -- Chen Chih-chung and Huang Jui-
chiang.</P>
      <P>Apart from funds from the Swiss banks, US$7.98 million, the sum from sales of 54
bonds kept by the Chen family, was also wired back to the SID accounts, putting
the total sum at about US$18.4 million.</P>
      <P>In addition to the US$21 billion frozen in the two banks, the former first
family in June 2007 also transferred to a Swiss bank NT$570 million (US$17.67
million) of the NT$740 million it had in a Cathay United Bank vault.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors have said all the money stashed by Chen's family overseas was
illegally acquired and should be confiscated.</P>
      <P>The former president and his wife Wu Shu-chen were both sentenced to life in
prison and fines of NT$200 million and NT$300 million respectively in September
last year on charges of taking bribes, money laundering and forgery.</P>
      <P>Chen and Wu appealed and had their jail sentences reduced to 20 years and fines
cut to NT$170 million and NT$200 million respectively on June 11. Both
prosecutors and the couple appealed the new sentences to the higher court. (By

      <P>Taiwan will seek inclusion of 5,824 industrial products on a list for tariff
reductions during talks with China on trade in merchandise that are scheduled to
start in March 2011, an economic official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan approved late Tuesday the controversial economic
cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) Taiwan signed with China in June, and was
scheduled to handle relevant amendments to customs regulations late Wednesday.</P>
      <P>After being endorsed by the legislature, the ECFA is expected to take effect on
both sides of the Taiwan Strait in September, the official said.</P>
      <P>The two sides will then initiate negotiations on investment agreements and are
expected to start further talks on agreements involving trade in products, trade
in services, and the establishment of a dispute resolution mechanism by the end
of March, as stipulated in the ECFA, the official added.</P>
      <P>After the amendments clear the legislature, commodity trade negotiations between
Taiwan and China will focus on certain types of products that are given eight-
digit numeric codes by the Directorate General of Customs, he said.</P>
      <P>These include petrochemical and machinery tools items, as well as automobiles
and flat panel display products.</P>
      <P>There are 8,726 items with the eight-digit codes. Of them, 2,902 items are set
to enjoy tariff exemptions under the ECFA's terms from Jan. 1, 2011, leaving
5,824 such products for the next talks, the official explained.</P>
      <P>According to customs data, Taiwan's total exports to China of the 539 early
harvest items amounted to US$13.84 billion in 2009, representing 16.1 percent of
Taiwan's total cross-strait exports by value.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, China's total exports to Taiwan of the 267 early harvest items on
China's list amounted to US$2.86 billion in 2009, representing 10.5 percent of
the mainland's total cross-strait exports by value.</P>
      <P>For China's part, Tang Wei,  head of China's Ministry of Commerce's Department
of Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau, said Wednesday that China has completed the
ratification process of the ECFA and is awaiting written notification from
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to Article 15 of the ECFA, following the agreement's signing, the two
sides should notify each other with written documents after completing relevant
legal procedures. The pact will come into effect the day after both sides
receive the documents.</P>

      <P>A record number of international exhibitors will participate in an art fair that
will be held at the Taipei World Trade Center this month, the organizers said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Compared to last year when Art Taipei attracted 43 foreign exhibitors, this year
more than half of the 100 exhibitors will be from abroad, the Taiwan Art Gallery
Association said.</P>
      <P>"In addition to the 53 overseas  galleries  that will be represented at the
exhibition, we have, for the first time, invited about 60 international
collectors to visit Taiwan for the fair," said vice chairman of the association
Richard Chang.</P>
      <P>One of the highlights of the fair will be the exhibition of internationally
famous pieces such as Cai Guo-Qiang's gunpowder on paper work titled "Flora" and
valued at US$800,000, the association said.</P>
      <P>Zao Wou-Ki's watercolor painting "Sans Title", valued at 80,000 euros will also
be on display, it said.</P>
      <P>The exhibition will be divided into six sections --  Art Galleries, Mega
Contemporary, Ela-Video, Art Taipei PHOTO, Made in Taiwan--Young Artist
Discovery and Art Media.</P>
      <P>Art Taipei PHOTO is a new section that will display contemporary works by
Taiwanese photographers,  said Joanne Chen, marketing director of the
association.</P>
      <P>It will include the work of award-winning artists such as Shen Chao-liang whose
piece "Stage" will be on display, and the work of the winners and finalists of

quality show that would allow the many galleries and collectors to gain a better
understanding of the development of art in Taiwan," Chang said.</P>
      <P>Last year, sales at the fair amounted to NT$460 million, which was good

    <HEADLINE>Grandparents Day to be observed from 2010</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Education announced Wednesday that starting this year National
Grandparents Day will be celebrated on the fourth Sunday of August to honor
grandparents.</P>
      <P>The designation of Grandparents Day, which falls on Aug. 29 this year, is also
aimed at strengthening relationships between young and older generations to
facilitate integration of traditional and modern cultures and promote intimacy
among family members, the ministry said.</P>
      <P>According to ministry officials, many countries around the world have long
celebrated a national grandparents day to encourage family reunions  and better
care for senior  people.  For instance, Grandparents Day is observed on the
first Sunday of September in the United States, on the fourth Sunday of November
in Singapore, the last Sunday of October in Russia and on July 26 in Portugal.</P>
      <P>Officials said the last Sunday of August was chosen with the hope that
grandparents will observe the day together with their children and grandchildren
before schools reopen in September after summer vacation.</P>
      <P>As a publicity campaign to raise public awareness of the day, family education
centers in various cities and counties around the country will sponsor summer
camps for grandparents and grandchildren.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  the results  of a survey  on transgenerational interaction or
relationships released Wednesday showed that 80 percent of grandparents
interviewed could easily list the names of each of their grandchildren.</P>
      <P>In contrast, only 36.7 percent of grandchildren responding to the poll could
list the names of their grandparents, and 10.3 percent said they were totally
unaware of their grandparents' names.</P>
      <P>In Chinese culture, grandparents often call their grandchildren by their names,
while grandchildren use terms for "grandmother" or "grandfather" when addressing
or referring to their grandparents.</P>
      <P>The poll also found that 40 percent of grandparents surveyed clearly remember
their grandchildren's birthdays, but that only 5.8 percent of grandchildren
remember all their grandparents' birthdays. Equally disappointing was that more
than 60 percent of grandchildren did not know any of their grandparents'
birthdays, the ministry said.</P>
      <P>Although the poll results showed that 50 percent of the families surveyed have
three generations living together, nearly 20 percent of grandchildren from those
families have never vacationed with their grandparents.</P>

      <P>A team from Taiwan defeated Canada 10-0 at the 2010 Junior League Baseball World
Series Tuesday in the U.S., virtually  clinching a spot in the tournament's
international championship game.</P>
      <P>The victory, shortened to five innings because Taiwan was leading by 10 runs,
improved the record of the Chung-Ching Junior Little League team from Taipei to
3-0 in the five-team international pool.</P>
      <P>The club had already defeated teams from Guatemala (7-2) and Ukraine (13-0) in
its first two games in round robin play and will face a team from Mexico on Aug.
20 Taiwan time to clinch first place in the international division.</P>
      <P>The top two teams in the international pool after round-robin play will vie for
the international championship on Aug. 21 Taiwan time, and the winner will play
the U.S. champion a day later for the World Series title.</P>
      <P>The Junior League World Series is the "older brother" of the Little League World

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Wednesday that Taiwan will quickly become an
economic and trade hub in the Asia Pacific region after a trade pact with China
takes effect.</P>
      <P>Ma said that the signing of the economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA)
has led many countries to reevaluate  their investments  in Taiwan and that most
plan to increase  their investments.</P>
      <P>"With the Industrial Innovation Act, Taiwan is more likely to become a global
innovation center, and likewise, with the ECFA and its supplementary measures,
Taiwan will also become an economic and trade hub in the Asia Pacific region, "
Ma said while addressing an innovation award ceremony following the Legislative
Yuan's approval of the controversial trade pact late Tuesday.</P>
      <P>After the regional hub is formed, Ma said more Taiwanese and foreign enterprises
will be willing to set up their regional headquarters in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>At the 2010 Lite-On Award ceremony, Ma also encouraged local companies to
continue to enhance their innovation and R&amp;D, with the aim of raising the
country's R&amp;D investment by 8 percent-10 percent by 2011 and make R&amp;D
represent 3 percent of the country's GDP in two years.</P>
      <P>Ma said he hopes Taiwan will become a "country of innovation" instead of just
specializing in original equipment manufacturing (OEM).</P>
      <P>"It is good to see that Taiwanese companies are gradually transforming
themselves from followers to pioneers," he said.</P>
      <P>He also said that the government is planning to launch a major cross-
disciplinary award for innovation talent next year as one of the events to
celebrate the country's centenary.</P>

      <P>Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen said Wednesday that
her party will let the people decide the fate of the cross-strait economic
cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) if the DPP were to return to power.</P>
      <P>"It's regrettable and worrisome that the Legislative Yuan has failed to
seriously screen the China pact and as a result, Taiwan's democracy has been
greatly undermined, " Tsai said in comments on the legislature's passage of the
pact a day earlier.</P>
      <P>Calling the ECFA part of "an export-oriented economic development policy, " Tsai
said it may benefit certain sectors and sustain Taiwan's gross domestic product
(GDP) growth, but would certainly fail to create job opportunities or narrow the
gap between the urban and rural areas.</P>
      <P>Tsai cited Taiwan's sixth naphtha cracker operated by the Formosa Plastics Group
in central Taiwan's Yunlin County as an example, saying it had fallen short of
creating sufficient jobs for local residents.</P>
      <P>She said the ECFA is "a result of faulty thinking" by President Ma Ying-jeou's
administration as it resorts to lower Chinese tariffs as the only means of
sharpening Taiwan's competitiveness.</P>
      <P>China, which is full of uncertainty politically and economically, is free to
raise or lower its tariffs for imports from Taiwan at any time, Tsai said, and
"it would be quite risky to put Taiwan's development chances in the hands of
China."</P>
      <P>Tsai said that the DPP would not rule out the possibility of holding a
referendum to decide whether to abolish the ECFA if the party returns to power.</P>
      <P>The DPP was Taiwan's ruling party between 2000 and 2008.</P>

      <P>The other three -- Kentucky Fried Chicken, Burger King, and Mos Burger -- did

      <P>The recently-signed ECFA provides Kaohsiung with an opportunity to become a new
regional hub for research and development (R&amp;D) , Kaohsiung County
Magistrate Yang Chiu-hsing said Wednesday in a county council meeting.</P>
      <P>For example, Yang said, a Japanese factory agreed Tuesday to set up its R&amp;D
center in Kaohsiung County because it would enjoy tariff concessions on products
exported from Taiwan to China.</P>
      <P>Given the chance, Yang said, he would invite Foxconn Technology Group to invest
in Kaohsiung and thus help move the area toward growth and expansion.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung's economy has been slow for the last 10 years, Yang said, adding that
his mission is to turn the tide.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung, with its large hinterland, is capable of catching up, if not
surpassing, Singapore in terms of international status, he said in an interview
published by the Lianhe Zaobao (United Morning News) of Singapore on the same
day.</P>
      <P>But without the cross-strait Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement (ECFA),
Taiwan would find it difficult to forge free trade agreements (FTAs)  with other
countries and would thus become marginalized, he said.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan  will then turn into the Philippines  instead  of Singapore," he said.</P>
      <P>He said he supported the ECFA on condition that Taiwan does not open its market
wider to agricultural products from China and does not allow Chinese laborers to
enter the job market.</P>
      <P>"Small countries must be wise in dealing with large countries, " Yang said.</P>
      <P>He criticized the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) as not dealing with the
China issue in a pragmatic manner.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Production value of Taiwan's integrated circuit (IC) sector for the third
quarter is expected to rise 7.89 percent from the second quarter as global
demand remains strong, a report from the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA)
said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The strong demand is anticipated as the third quarter is the peak season for the
global high-tech industry, according to the report released by Industry &amp;
Technology Intelligence Services (ITIS) , a research unit of the MOEA's
Department of Industrial Technology.</P>
      <P>The ITIS said the local IC sector's production value for the third quarter is
expected to hit NT$477.1 billion (US$14.96 billion), compared with NT$442.2
billion recorded in the second quarter.</P>
      <P>In the second quarter, production value of the local IC sector rose 12.8 percent
from the previous quarter. The ITIS said the slower growth in the third quarter
reflects the high comparison base in the second quarter.</P>
      <P>The ITIS added that a shortage of production capacity in the sector will also
limit growth in the third quarter.</P>
      <P>The report said the insufficient production capacity has prompted several IC
heavyweights to raise their capacity expenditure for 2010.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the world's largest contract chipmaker,
has hiked its capacity expenditure to US$5.9 billion from the previously planned
US$4.8 billion, while United Microelectronics Corp. has raised its planned
spending to US$1.8 billion from US$1.2 billion-1.5 billion.</P>
      <P>During the same three-month period, production value of the IC design segment is
expected to reach NT$137.5 billion, up 15 percent from the previous quarter on
the back of demand for PCs, notebook computers, LCD TVs and cell phones, the
ITIS said.</P>
      <P>Production value of the IC manufacturing segment for the third quarter is
expected to rise 5.2 percent to NT$229 billion, production value of the IC
packaging segment may grow 5 percent to NT$76.1 billion and production value of
the IC testing segment is likely to add 6.2 percent to reach NT$34.5 percent.</P>
      <P>In the second quarter, production value of the IC manufacturing segment rose
15.4 percent from the first quarter to NT$217.6 billion, and production value of
the IC packaging segment gained 13.3 percent to NT$72.5 billion.</P>
      <P>Production value of the IC testing segment in the second quarter added 14
percent to NT$32.5 billion, and production value of the IC design segment grew
7.7 percent to reach NT$119.6 billion.</P>

      <P>An office space in the Taipei Financial Center was sold in an auction Wednesday
at a record price of NT$955,000 per ping (3.3 square meters) of the Dunbei
Business District in Taipei City, the auctioneers reported.</P>
      <P>The space, located on different floors of the building, totaled 1,905 pings and
was sold to a funeral service called Lung Yen Life Service Co. at the bid price
of NT$1.82 billion (US$56.86 million), said the auction house Savills Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The winning bid was 46.5 percent above the ask price, Savills Taiwan said in a
statement.</P>
      <P>Savills Taiwan General Manager Gordon Kao said the price did not go higher
because the buyer can only own part of the building.</P>
      <P>"This auction failed to attract many bidders because some investors like to buy
an entire building, but this building has several owners," he told reporters.</P>
      <P>However, if the parking space is excluded from the auctioned office space, the
price per ping reached NT$1.166 million, the second highest bidding price this
year after NT$1.3 million per ping set by Taiwan's A-Data Technology Co. in
buying the President Enterprise Corporation Tower in the Xinyi Planning
District, Kao said.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, it was a "pretty good price," he said, noting that the building is
new and is a 10-minute drive from Taipei Songshan Airport.</P>
      <P>The deal came amid growing interest among foreign investors in Taiwan's
commercial properties as they seek to capitalize on the business opportunities
that are expected to result from the economic cooperation framework agreement
(ECFA) that was signed between Taiwan and China in June.</P>
      <P>Experts  said that these  investors  are also anticipating opportunities in the
tourism sector that would arise if Chinese tourists are allowed to make
individual visits to Taiwan instead of in tour groups only.</P>
      <P>Billy Yen, general manager of the real estate company DTZ, said 2010 marks a
beginning for Taiwan's commercial properties because of the ECFA.</P>
      <P>At a press conference Tuesday, Yen said that in the fourth quarter of the year
DTZ will hold open bids for 41 urban properties in Taiwan that will have a total
value of NT$30 billion.</P>
      <P>That figure is higher than the combined value of the 136 public bids held by DTZ
in Taiwan over the past 10 years, he said.</P>
      <P>So far, insurance companies are showing the strongest interest in buying
commercial properties, and some want to use the space as headquarters, he said.</P>
      <P>The price of some commercial properties in Taipei jumped 27 to 31 percent in the
first half of the year, Ko Hung-an, deputy head of Sinyi Global Asset Management
Inc., told reporters recently.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, an increasing number of investors from Europe and Asia have been
visiting Taiwan recently to look for properties, according to Tony Chao,  the
Taiwan managing director of the international real-estate company Jones Lang
LaSalle.</P>
      <P>"I have been working in Taiwan for more than 20 years and I had never seen a
developer from Hong Kong or Singapore, but there have been some in recent
weeks," he said.</P>

      <P>The government has been closely monitoring China's military build-up and will
not halt its efforts to upgrade the nation's defense capability even as it seeks
to further reduce tensions across the Taiwan Strait, the Presidential Office
said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>"There is no need for the people to worry about a reported cross-strait military
imbalance in favor of China, " Presidential Office spokesman Lo Chih-chiang
said.</P>
      <P>He was responding to the opposition's accusation of "inaction" on the part of
the Presidential Office after a U.S Pentagon report the previous day warned of
China's continued military build-up.</P>
      <P>Lo said that cross-strait military imbalance is a structural problem that dates
back prior to 2008 when the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) was in
power.</P>
      <P>In its political posturing, the DPP administration never stopped provoking and
confronting China, which led to the Taiwan Strait becoming one of two "flash
points" in east Asia, Lo said.</P>
      <P>President Ma, on the other hand, has spared no effort to reduce cross-strait
hostility since he took office in 2008 and has forged 14 agreements with China
to increase exchanges between the two sides, Lo said.</P>
      <P>"President Ma has successfully turned the flash point in the strait into 'an
avenue of peace and prosperity, ' an achievement that has been recognized by the
United States, Japan, the European Union, and other countries around the world,"
Lo said.</P>
      <P>Besides, since Ma took office, the U.S. government has approved the sale of two
arms packages to Taiwan, valued at US$13 billion, which has contributed greatly
to upgrading the country's defense capability, he said.</P>
      <P>Quoting the ancient Chinese tactician Sun Tsu who said "the highest form of
generalship is to balk the enemy's plans, " Lo said that the best way to put an
end to conflict is "to replace confrontation with engagement, as the Ma
administration has done.</P>
      <P>Taiwan will strive to build a "lean but mean" military as a deterrent to war,
instead of engaging in an arms race with China, he said.</P>

      <P>He was responding to the opposition's accusation of "inaction" on the part of
the Presidential Office after a U.S Pentagon report the previous day warned of
China's continued military build-up.</P>
      <P>Lo said that cross-strait military imbalance is a structural problem that dates
back prior to 2008 when the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) was in
power.</P>
      <P>In its political posturing, the DPP administration never stopped provoking and
confronting China, which led to the Taiwan Strait becoming one of two "flash
points" in east Asia, Lo said.</P>
      <P>President Ma, on the other hand, has spared no effort to reduce cross-strait
hostility since he took office in 2008 and has forged 14 agreements with China
to increase exchanges between the two sides, Lo said.</P>
      <P>"President Ma has successfully turned the flash point in the strait into 'an
avenue of peace and prosperity, ' an achievement that has been recognized by the
United States, Japan, the European Union, and other countries around the world,"
Lo said.</P>
      <P>Besides, since Ma took office, the U.S. government has approved the sale of two
arms packages to Taiwan, valued at US$13 billion, which has contributed greatly
to upgrading the country's defense capability, he said.</P>
      <P>Quoting the ancient Chinese tactician Sun Tsu who said "the highest form of
generalship is to balk the enemy's plans, " Lo said that the best way to put an
end to conflict is "to replace confrontation with engagement, as the Ma
administration has done.</P>
      <P>Taiwan will strive to build a "lean but mean" military as a deterrent to war,
instead of engaging in an arms race with China, he said.</P>

      <P>The Legislative Yuan approved Wednesday an amendment to the Customs Tariff Law
as part of the measures to be implemented in line with a cross-strait trade
pact.</P>
      <P>Under the amendment, tariffs will be dropped to zero on 267 items from China, in
a three-stage process between 2011 and 2013, in accordance with the economic
cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) Taiwan and China signed on June 29.</P>
      <P>The legislature  ratified the ECFA Tuesday and passed the amendment Wednesday
after an 11-hour meeting in which members of the various party caucus debated
and voted on all articles of the revised law.</P>
      <P>The tariff reduction on the 267 items from China will amount to an annual loss
of NT$3.4 billion in customs revenue for Taiwan, while China will lose NT$29.5
billion when it removes the tariffs on 539 categories of imports from Taiwan
under the ECFA, according to an estimate by the Ministry of Finance.</P>

(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Singapore has suddenly become the centerpiece of the year-end mayoral election
for the future special municipality of Kaohsiung, with the three major
candidates seeking to "Singaporize" the southern port city.</P>
      <P>Indeed, duplicating Singapore could be a resolution tailor-made for Kaohsiung,
where businesses are languishing and the unemployment rate is among the highest
in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Almost all the strengths of Singapore can also be found in Kaohsiung,  including
an exceptional deep-water port,  pleasant climate, favorable natural environment
and diligent people. For a long time, however, Kaohsiung was stranded by various
trade barriers and closed itself off to prospering China.</P>
      <P>Now, the cross-Taiwan Strait economic cooperation framework agreement has pried
open the door to liberalization. Within the next few years, Taiwan will open its
doors to the world and remove various trade barriers. If Kaohsiung can further
give itself a makeover, upgrade its infrastructure and create a friendly living
and business environment, then it will catch up with and even surpass Singapore.</P>
      <P>It is not impossible to lift Kaohsiung to stardom. Remember that Kaohsiung used
to be the world's third-largest port. The revival of Kaohsiung would be a sign
of Taiwan's metamorphosis. (Editorial abstract -- Aug. 19, 2010)</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan vigilant in face of China's military buildup: Ma</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan has been closely monitoring China's military buildup while continuously
seeking to upgrade it's defense capability, despite improved cross-strait
relations, President Ma Ying-jeou told a Japanese daily Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's national defense system has remained vigilant in the face of China's
incessant military expansion and upgrading, Ma said during an interview with the
Japanese business daily Sankei Shimbun.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan will maintain good military ties with the United States, including
continuing to purchase weapons from the U.S., and Taiwan will continue to hone
its defensive skills by conducting military exercises, " Ma said in the
interview that was posted on the paper's website.</P>
      <P>He stressed the importance of the Japan-U.S. security treaty signed in 1960,
saying that it has since formed the bedrock of peace and stability in East Asia.</P>
      <P>On a spate of accidents in which Taiwanese fishing boats were rammed or chased
by Japanese patrol boats in waters near the diplomatically disputed Diaoyutai
Islands, known in Japanese as the Senkaku Islands, Ma said Japan and Taiwan have
had different stances on the thorny issue.</P>
      <P>The time is not yet ripe for Taiwan and Japan to resolve this dispute, Ma said,
adding that Taiwan will not ally with China against Japan in the dispute.</P>
      <P>"This is an issue that Taiwan and Japan must tackle between themselves," Ma
said.</P>
      <P>"I hope both countries will work first to reach a consensus on how to address
the matter regarding fishermen's rights," he added.</P>
      <P>Ma also talked about Taiwan's signing of an economic cooperation framework
agreement (ECFA) with China, which was passed into law by Taiwan's legislature
Aug. 17 and is slated to take effect later this year.</P>
      <P>Under the law, China will remove the tariffs on 539 categories of imports from
Taiwan, while Taiwan will give tariff concessions to 267 items from China.</P>
      <P>Ma said mainland China has been the major barrier to Taiwan's bid to sign free
trade agreements (FTAs) with other countries.</P>
      <P>"The ECFA has obviously been a boost to Taiwan's FTA efforts, epitomized by new
developments between Taiwan and Singapore, which could start talks on the
signing of a trade cooperation pact soon, " the president told the daily.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Talk of the day -- GDP growth rate and commodity price hikes</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>08/19/10  11:13:21
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Bloomberg News said Wednesday that Taiwan's gross domestic product (GDP) growth
rate could exceed 10 percent for the second quarter of this year, thanks to
robust exports of microchips and flat panel monitors.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics
(DGBAS)  is  scheduled  to release  the  country's second-quarter GDP growth
data Thursday. It previously forecast 7.66 percent year-on-year growth for Q2.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, domestic food prices are facing inflationary pressure as
international grain prices have spiked on a Russian export ban and abnormal
weather in major grain-producing countries such as Australia and Canada.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from the local media coverage of the issues:</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>Bloomberg gave a rosy double-digit forecast on Taiwan's Q2 GDP growth after
consulting 14 economists. It said that although Taiwan's major trading partners
-- Japan, the United States and China -- have shown signs of economic slowdown,
the country's economy continues steaming ahead.</P>
      <P>Sustained economic recovery is fueling hikes in housing and consumer product
prices and may even lead to a rise in capital costs, Bloomberg said.</P>
      <P>Responding to Bloomberg's optimistic forecast, Christina Liu, chairwoman of the
Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) , said Wednesday that she
would not be surprised if the second-quarter GDP growth figure to be released by
the DGBAS exceeds the original projection.</P>
      <P>"For years, Taiwan has solely relied on exports for its economic growth, but
this year, our growth structure has seen a change, with domestic demand or
investment also contributing much to growth, " Liu said. "It is an encouraging
development that exports and domestic investment have become our two growth
engines." (Aug. 19, 2010).</P>
      <P>Economic Daily News:</P>
      <P>International wheat prices have risen by 20 percent since the beginning of this
year, and soybean prices are also skyrocketing. Market sources said the price of
the latest shipment of wheat bought by the Taiwan Wheat Flour Mills Industry
Association reached US$330 a ton, up 30 percent from the previous shipment.</P>
      <P>Maize prices on the international futures market hit a half-year high of US$9.1
per kilogram last week, up more than 10 percent from the spot market price, the
Taiwan Feed Industry Association said.</P>
      <P>With corn, flour and soybean prices rising on the international market, prices
for eggs, meat, bread, cooking oil and other daily necessities are facing
inflationary pressure.</P>
      <P>Vice Premier Sean Chen has ordered the Ministry of Economic Affairs to closely
monitor domestic commodity price fluctuations and take timely action to cushion
price hikes by adjusting supplies ahead of the coming Ghost Festival, which
falls on Aug. 24 this year. (Aug. 19, 2010).</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>The DGBAS will also release a report on the survey of 2008 household income and
expenditure later Thursday. According to tax data, Taiwan's wealth gap widened
further in 2008, with the richest 20 percent earning 66 times more than the
poorest 20 percent during the year.</P>
      <P>The data also showed that Taiwan has 8,500 taxpayers who made more than NT$10
million (US$312,500) in 2008, with 4,700 of them living in Taipei City and 906
in Taipei County. The figures indicate that 66 percent of Taiwan's wealthiest
people take residence in Taipei City and Taipei County, while only a tiny
fraction of them live in the eastern Hualien and Taitung counties. (Aug. 19,
2010).</P>
      <P>Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>CEPD Chairwoman Christina Liu said Wednesday during a meeting with senior
executives of major publicly listed conglomerates that the ratio of export
orders produced at local companies' overseas factories had surged to 50 percent
in June from 2000's 13 percent.</P>
      <P>"Although such a trend will contribute to our GDP growth, local people will not
benefit much from the gains as not many jobs will be created from increased
export orders, " the country's top economic planner said. (Aug. 19, 2010).</P>

08/19/10  11:24:03

    <TEXT>
      <P>show that the number of households living below the poverty line rose to a
record high of 108,000 in the second quarter of 2010. The ministry, however,
said the rise does not necessarily represent an increase in poverty and should
be interpreted as the result of expanded welfare benefits.</P>
      <P>This explanation leaves us totally speechless. In any case, the figure sends a
very serious warning message.</P>
      <P>The ministry said the number increased because looser criteria have been adopted
since early 2008 to define households that are qualified for public assistance.
But this means that the same criteria have been adopted over the last three
years, so how can the development be attributed to the relaxed criteria?</P>
      <P>Also, the MOI said the number was boosted by the increasing "minimum cost of
living" in Taiwan. But the fact is that there has not been much change in the
minimum cost of living over the past five years.</P>
      <P>Another reason cited by the ministry is the relaxation of the criteria regarding
real estate ownership by low-income households in 2010. But even before that,
the number of poor families had been rising -- by 40,000 within the last 10
years.</P>
      <P>Neglecting the economic aspects of the phenomenon, the government is missing an
opportunity to thoroughly reflect on its industrial, educational and labor
policies.</P>
      <P>A bureaucratic culture that is capable only of interpreting figures positively
and does not think in reverse is the root cause of an unprogressive government
that must be corrected as soon as possible. (Editorial abstract -- Aug. 19,

    <TEXT>
      <P>Foxconn Technology Group, a China-based subsidiary of Taiwan's Hon Hai group,
said Wednesday it plans to raise its workforce in China to 1.3 million from the
current 920,000 over the next 12 months.</P>
      <P>Cheng Tien-tsung, deputy chief executive of Foxconn, said his group is migrating
from coastal areas to inland China -- such as Chengdu in Sichuan Province and
Zhengzhou in Henan Province -- and hiring new employees.</P>
      <P>He said the group's Shenzhen base, which is planning to change to a three-shift
schedule from the current two shifts, will also need more workers in the short
term.</P>
      <P>Hon Hai Precision Industry, the world's largest contract maker of electronics
products for high-tech giants such as Apple, Dell and Hewlett-Packard, is the
parent company of Foxconn Technology Group.</P>
      <P>Foxconn has faced tight scrutiny and harsh criticism from the public as it was
accused of mistreating its Chinese workers after a spate of employee suicides at
its Shenzhen complex earlier this year.</P>
      <P>Amid escalating criticism, Terry Gou, chairman of Hon Hai Precision, apologized
in June over the suicides and vowed to take good care of his employees by
seeking assistance from sociology and psychological professionals.</P>
      <P>Gou also strongly denied accusations that his company was running "blood and
sweat" factories in China.</P>
      <P>Hon Hai Precision announced two wage hikes in one week in June for its Chinese
workers, bringing salaries to 2,000 Chinese yuan (US$294) a month from 900 yuan.
The move triggered pressure on other foreign investors in China in terms of
employee compensation, especially in coastal cities.</P>
      <P>Foxconn is relocating its production to the Chinese inland area from Shenzhen to
alleviate the impact from rising labor costs.</P>
      <P>Cheng, however, said that Foxconn will not leave Shenzhen completely despite the
production migration, adding that the group is planning to transform its
Shenzhen production base into a research and development and quality testing
center focusing on innovation.</P>
      <P>In the long term, the workforce at the Shenzhen complex is expected to fall to
300,000-350,000 from the current 450,000, Cheng said.</P>
      <P>Foxconn held an employee rally called "Love Your Life, Love Your Family" at
plants across China on Wednesday as part of its efforts to boost worker morale
after the suicides.</P>
      <P>About 50,000 Chinese employees participated in the rally at Foxconn's facilities
throughout China, according to media reports.</P>

      <P>Local residents on Thursday continued their blockade of the three major roads
leading to Formosa Plastic Group's (FPG) petrochemical complex in Mailiao,
Yunlin County for the third consecutive  day,  but dispersed after drawing
complaints from motorists about traffic disruptions.</P>
      <P>Residents in Mailiao and neighboring Taisi and Dacheng townships demanded
compensation after a major fire at one of the complex's oil refining plants
broke out on July 25, contaminating nearby farms and fish farms. The fire was
the second at the complex in three weeks.</P>
      <P>Residents began their blockade of the roads on Tuesday after compensation talks
with FPG broke down.</P>
      <P>They demanded that the conglomerate pay residents NT$1.8 billion (US$53 million)
for polluting the area and harming their health.</P>
      <P>They also demanded FPG promise to relocate the complex within 10 years. The
company said it was only willing to pay NT$500 million -- higher than the NT$450
million it originally proposed -- but local residents rejected the offer.</P>
      <P>During the blockade Thursday, protesters walked into the street at 6: 30 a.m.,
causing traffic jams stretching about 1 kilometer on one of the roads and
drawing widespread complaints from motorists.</P>
      <P>Dissatisfied with the county government's role in compensation talks, the
protesters shouted "County Magistrate Su Chi-feng, step down, " and complained
of "under-the-table operations." Formosa Plastics' management urged the
protesters to respect its employees' right to work, while using shuttle buses to
transport its employees.</P>
      <P>Formosa Plastics called for rational and peaceful communications and stressed
that the company will continue negotiations with local residents in an attempt
to reach an agreement.</P>
      <P>The protesters dispersed at around 9: 00 a.m. without saying whether the
demonstration would continue Friday.</P>

      <P>Taiwan share prices closed flat Thursday after a tug of war between selling in
old economy stocks and bargain hunting in large cap electronics, dealers said.</P>
      <P>The weighted index rose 4.84 points, or 0.06 percent, to 7,928.94, after moving
between 7,886.73 and 7,948.73, on turnover of NT$123.35 billion (US$3.87
billion).</P>
      <P>The market opened slightly higher, up 1.38 points, despite lingering concerns
over the global economic climate, dealers said.</P>
      <P>During the trade, bargain hunters turned active, picking up select high tech
heavyweights on low valuations in price, but profit taking pressure, in
particular in the shipping and financial sectors, offset the gains, dealers
said.</P>
      <P>A total of 1,609 stocks closed up and 2,040 down, while 303 remained unchanged.</P>
      <P>The machinery and electronics sector scored the highest gains, up 0.8 percent.
Foodstuffs rose 0.5 percent, plastics and chemical stocks gained 0.3 percent and
cement shares added 0.1 percent.</P>
      <P>The financial sector fell 1.9 percent, the textile sector lost 0.9 percent, the
paper and pulp sector dropped 0.8 percent and the construction sector closed
down 0.5 percent.</P>
      <P>"Judging from the gains posted by large cap electronics stocks, I suspect
foreign institutional investors stood on the buying side today after recent
selloff, " TLG Asset Management analyst Arch Shih said.</P>
      <P>Shih said further gains on Wall Street overnight gave some comfort to foreign
investors and prompted them to resume buying.</P>
      <P>"But, the buying was technical in nature as fears of weaker global demand on a
slower global economy persisted," Shih said.</P>
      <P>Such quick rotational buying is still dominating the trade and the local bourse
still lacks a mainstream sector to push the index higher, Shih said.</P>
      <P>"The market remains in a consolidation mode ahead of technical pressure at the
key 8,000 point mark, " he said, referring to the latest profit taking in
shipping and financial stocks, which recently staged a strong rebound amid
optimism over cross strait business exchanges.</P>
      <P>Shih said it will take some time to digest the selling before the market
overcomes the technical hurdles ahead of the 8,000- point mark.</P>
      <P>Hon Hai Precision,  the world's largest contract maker of electronics products,
was up 3.05 percent at NT$135.00, PC firm AsusTek rose 2.88 percent to NT$232.00
and IC packaging and testing service provider ASE increased 1.25 percent to
NT$24.30.</P>
      <P>Among financial stocks, Cathay Financial fell 2.03 percent to NT$48.25 and Chang
Hwa Bank dropped 2.66 percent to NT$18.30.</P>

    <HEADLINE>President backs decision to continue production at science park</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou defended Thursday the government's decision to allow
industrial production to continue at the Central Taiwan Science Park's Houli
site in central Taiwan, despite a court order to suspend the development
project.</P>
      <P>Ma said the decision was made based on the principle of "legitimate
expectations, " which he described as the most important foundation of countries
governed by the rule of law.</P>
      <P>"We are abiding by the law rather than playing on words, " Ma said during the
Seventh National Industrial Development Conference held in Taipei.</P>
      <P>The Taipei High Administration Court ruled in July that all development work at
the park's Houli and Erlin sites had to be stopped until environmental impact
assessments were completed and approved.</P>
      <P>The park administration agreed to stop work on the sites' infrastructure
development but opted against shutting down companies that had already started
production or were in the process of building their plants at the Houli site.</P>
      <P>No companies had begun moving into the Erlin site at the time of the court's
ruling.</P>
      <P>Pointing to the constitutional stipulation that "environmental and ecological
protection shall be given equal consideration with economic and technological
development," Ma said this means that both legitimate interests will be weighted
against each other to determine which one is more important.</P>
      <P>He noted that the Basic Environment Act also states that in the event that
economic, technological or social development will have a seriously negative
impact on the environment, the protection of the environment shall prevail.</P>
      <P>"It will depend on the impact as to which of the two will be given priority,
which is the reason why environmental impact assessments are required," he said.</P>
      <P>According  to  the  president,  economic  development  and environmental
protection are equally important to Taiwan, and there are ways for them to co-
exist.</P>
      <P>For example, he said, there has been a long-running fight between
environmentalists and Hualien residents over whether to continue a Suhua Freeway
project tabled a few years ago, after the project failed to pass an
environmental impact assessment.</P>
      <P>The dispute was later resolved following the development of an alternative
project to build a new expressway, Ma said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>President pushes for U.S. to sell Taiwan F-16 C/Ds</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou urged the United States Thursday to sell F-16 C/D jet
fighters to Taiwan to prevent the balance of military power across the Taiwan
Strait from tilting further in China's favor.</P>
      <P>"The purpose of procuring advanced jet fighters is not to provoke war but to
beef up Taiwan's defense capability, " Ma said during a meeting with visiting
U.S. Senator Roland Burris (D-Ill.) at the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>It was the third time in less than three weeks that Ma made such an appeal to
the U.S. government, underscoring the urgency for Taiwan to acquire new jet
fighters to upgrade its air force fleet in the face of China's continued
military buildup.</P>
      <P>On the previous occasions, he was in a meeting Aug. 6 with a delegation from the
U.S. think tank Center for Strategic and International Studies, and with U.S.
Senator Arlen Specter, who chairs the Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Drugs
in the Senate, on Aug. 13.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the people of Taiwan are most concerned with the issue of
national security, Ma said he hopes the U.S. government will favorably consider
Taiwan's request to purchase F-16 C/Ds for air defense in order to stabilize the
cross-strait balance of military power, which has been shifting more
substantially in China's favor over the past years.</P>
      <P>He assured Burris that the proposed F-16 C/D procurement would be purely for the
purpose of reinforcing Taiwan's air defense -- not to prepare for war.</P>
      <P>"Our American friends can rest assured that the aircraft would be only for
defense purposes and national security, " Ma told his guest.</P>
      <P>On cross-strait relations, Ma said, the option for Taiwan and China is to
resolve their disputes by peaceful means. Since assuming office more than two
years ago, Ma said, his administration has been working hard to improve
relations with China and has succeeded in reducing cross-strait tensions.</P>
      <P>During the period, Taiwan signed 14 accords with China and this week the
Legislative Yuan ratified the landmark cross-strait economic cooperation
framework agreement (ECFA) and passed all related bills, he said.</P>
      <P>"We will exchange instruments of ratification with mainland China soon to
implement the trade pact," Ma said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, he noted, Taiwan and Singapore jointly announced on Aug. 5 that they
will explore the feasibility of an economic cooperation agreement that will be
similar to a free trade agreement.</P>
      <P>"Negotiations are scheduled to begin later this year," Ma said.</P>
      <P>In the wake of the ECFA's signing, Ma said, Taiwan will speed up economic
globalization to improve its competitiveness.</P>
      <P>At the same time, he said, Taiwan is looking forward to making progress in its
exchanges with the U.S. in the areas of trade, investment, education and
judicial cooperation, and hopes that dialogue under the Taiwan-U.S.  Trade and
Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA) will resume soon.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Three controversial packages of amendments to pave the way for the admission of
Chinese students to Taiwan's tertiary education institutions were likely to be
passed into law Thursday after lawmakers across partisan lines made compromises
to reach consensus on the issue.</P>
      <P>Legislators from both the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) and the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) spent that day debating the bill at an extraordinary
session before deciding to put it to a vote later in the day.</P>
      <P>The rival lawmakers  reached consensus  the day before to facilitate the
enactment by agreeing on a "one limit, two noes" proposal -- the bottom line of
the KMT lawmakers.</P>
      <P>The "one limit, two noes" proposal stipulates that Taiwan will impose a limit on
recognizing medical credentials issued by China, that Chinese students will not
be allowed to study in departments of local universities related to national
security and intelligence, and that students without ROC citizenship will not be
allowed to take part in civil service examinations.</P>
      <P>While agreeing with the proposal, the DPP also demanded a clause saying that
there should be restrictions to further regulate Chinese students working in
Taiwan after they graduate from local higher education institutions.</P>
      <P>The DPP had previously demanded that "three limits" and "six noes" be included
in the law amendments.</P>
      <P>The "three limits" refer to restrictions on the number of Chinese universities
that the government plans to recognize, the total number of Chinese college
students who can enter Taiwan to study, and a limit on the types of Chinese
diplomas that will be accredited in Taiwan. The "six noes" would ban Chinese
students from receiving scholarships or professional licenses, keep them from
working or staying in Taiwan upon graduation, ban them from receiving extra
points on examinations, and they would not be allowed to take part in civil
service examinations.</P>
      <P>Education Minister Wu Ching-chi said his office will respect the decisions made
by the legislature on the controversial bill, although he said the "one limit,
two noes" proposal seems to be redundant, as existing regulations in those
regards are already in place.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Ker Chien-ming, a whip of the DPP legislative caucus, said that since
Chinese students are unlikely to be barred from entering, the DPP will propose
hitting them with higher tuition levels -- a common practice for foreign
students in most other countries.</P>
      <P>"We'd like to negotiate with the KMT lawmakers over this issue, " Ker said.</P>

      <P>Researchers from Taiwan and Canada have developed a new microscopy technology
that allows for low-cost, portable imaging of the hepatitis C virus, making it
more convenient to conduct screenings, a Taiwanese researcher said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Under the sponsorship of Taiwan's National Science Council, the Industrial
Technology Research Institute and National Research Council (NRC) Canada,  an
international research team recently combined technologies developed in Canada
and Taiwan to create a screening device that can be carried in one hand.</P>
      <P>Led by Kao Fu-jen, a professor at National Yang-Ming University, and Albert
Stolow and John Pezacki from NRC Canada, the team jointly developed the high-
sensitivity imaging system by re-engineering a DVD reading and writing head so
that it can detect optical signals including fluorescence and tiny vibrations
from a technique called coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering.</P>
      <P>The device  creates  images from cell samples  that allow researchers to
determine whether the hepatitis C virus is present. The development is expected
to help sharply increase the efficiency of the diagnosis of chronic hepatitis C,
Kao said in a press release.</P>
      <P>The size of the device allows for point-of-care testing, which is diagnostic
testing at or near the site of patient care.</P>
      <P>According to Kao, the hepatitis C virus is spread through contact with infected
blood, and about 170 million worldwide are infected with it. Currently, there is
no vaccine against the virus.</P>
      <P>How the hepatitis C virus harms the livers of long-term carriers is still
unknown, but the risk of people with hepatitis C contracting liver cancer is 10
times higher than for ordinary people, the press release said.</P>
      <P>The goal of the collaboration project between Taiwan and Canada is to develop
real-time,  unobtrusive and efficient biomedical detection methods and
instruments for widespread application for hepatitis C and other infectious
diseases, it said.</P>

      <P>The Executive Yuan approved Thursday the central government's budget proposal
for 2011,  with projected expenditure amounting to NT$1.7896 trillion (US$56.07
billion) and projected revenue of NT$1.6306 trillion.</P>
      <P>The government will need to issue new debt of NT$429 billion next year to fill
the NT$159 billion budget shortfall, repay NT$66 billion in principal for
previous debt, and to cover four special budget proposals for 2011, officials
said.</P>
      <P>The special budget proposals include a NT$159.7 billion public construction
expansion plan and a NT$17.3 billion flood control plan that were also approved
by the Executive Yuan Thursday. The other two are a NT$21.7 billion plan on
post-Typhoon Morakot reconstruction and a NT$5.3 billion plan to clean up the
Shihmen Reservoir that were approved at prior sessions.</P>
      <P>According to Minister of Finance Lee Sush-der, tax revenue will rise NT$28.7
billion next year, mainly due to a NT$17.8 billion increase in revenue from
individual income tax because of an economic recovery.</P>
      <P>Lee said that by the end of next year, outstanding national debt will have
reached NT$4.9618 trillion, accounting for 37.79 percent of the country's gross
domestic product. The percentage will represent a record high, although it will
remain below the 40 percent ceiling, he added.</P>
      <P>By sector, educational, science and cultural spending account for NT$357.3
billion, or 20 percent, of the projected expenditure; social welfare spending

produce batteries for large buses.</P>
      <P>Pihsiang Machinery Manufacturing Co. Ltd., which is primarily an electric
scooter maker, said Thursday it intends to take a 15 percent stake in the joint
venture with Foshan Electrical and Lighting Co. (FEL) of China and to provide
the technology and materials for the manufacture of LPF bus batteries.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of a letter of intent signed between the two companies, the
battery factory will be set up in China, in Foshan, Guangdong Province, Pihsiang
deputy spokesman More Huang said.</P>
      <P>"We are engaged in negotiations and will try to finalize the investment plan
soon, " Huang said.</P>
      <P>The preliminary plan is to manufacture 15 million batteries for supply to FEL in
the first year of the project, he said.</P>
      <P>FEL is primarily a lighting equipment maker, but in the last two years it has
acquired three bus manufacturing plants in China.</P>
      <P>Huang said FEL plans to expand its annual bus production capacity to 2,000 units
by 2015, by which time it will require 100 million LPF batteries per year.</P>
      <P>FEL was impressed by Pihsiang's battery production technology after it tested
the batteries in its buses in April, Huang said.</P>
      <P>"Pihsiang holds the patents and FEL has the funds. We are going to be a good
match," he said.</P>

      <P>The American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) reaffirmed the "solid" relationship
between the United States and Taiwan Thursday in response to a question
regarding a domestic political controversy about current bilateral relations.</P>
      <P>"I think the U.S.-Taiwan relations are pretty solid, politically and
economically...but of course there is room for improvement, such as in the area
of educational and cultural exchange, " said Sheila Paskman, spokeswoman of the

      <P>Paskman was responding to a reporter's question about what Su Tseng-chang, the

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's economy in the second quarter of this year grew 12.53 percent from a
year earlier on the back of strong exports and recovering domestic demand, the
government said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The second quarter gross domestic product (GDP) growth beat a forecast of 7.66
percent the government made in May, the Directorate General of Budget,
Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) said.</P>
      <P>The DGBAS also revised upward the GDP growth for the first quarter to 13.71
percent from a preliminary 13.27 percent. j Taiwan's economy in the April-June
period grew for the third consecutive quarter after a global financial meltdown
battered the island's economic fundamentals in 2008-2009.</P>
      <P>Taiwan registered its worst-ever recession in the first quarter of 2009, with
GDP falling 9.06 percent, before the local economy gradually recovered and
climbed out of the recession in the fourth quarter of last year on rising global
demand as the impact from the financial crisis faded.</P>
      <P>In the second quarter, the local economy benefited from robust global demand, in
particular from China and other emerging markets, the DGBAS said in a statement.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, domestic consumption recovered to boost sales in the local retail,
restaurant, car and tourism businesses, while the high-tech sector expanded its
production capacity to lift private investment, the DGBAS added.</P>
      <P>During the three-month period, Taiwan's private consumption rose 4.41 percent
from a year earlier and private investment gained 37.48 percent year-on-year.</P>
      <P>In the first half of this year, Taiwan's economy grew 13.10 percent from a year
earlier, the DGBAS said.</P>
      <P>The agency said it has raised its forecast for 2010 GDP growth to 8.24 percent
from the previous estimate of 6.14 percent.</P>
      <P>It has also upgraded its estimated 2010 private consumption to 2.78 percent from
1.99 percent, while lifting the forecast of 2010 private investment to 23.40
percent from 18.38 percent.</P>
      <P>The island's consumer price index (CPI) is expected to rise 1.23 percent largely
on stable food prices, the agency said.</P>
      <P>For 2011, Taiwan's economy is expected to grow 4.64 percent from 2010 with
private investment up 1.44 percent, private consumption up 2.64 percent and the
CPI up 1.43 percent year-on-year, the DGBAS said.</P>

      <P>The Control Yuan censured the Ministry of National Defense Thursday for
promoting as many as 124 generals without following normal standards during the
tenures of eight defense ministers between 1994 and 2009.</P>
      <P>The National Defense and Information Committee of the highest watchdog body
approved a proposal by members Lee Ping-nan, Yu Teng Fang and Huang Huang-hsiung
to censure the ministry for failing to stick to regulations governing the
promotion of generals during the period.</P>
      <P>The three yuan members in their investigative report confirmed allegations that
"there were officers getting promoted through illegal means, which included
paying bribes."</P>
      <P>The reports said the 124 generals who got promoted not in compliance with
regulations represented 13.63 percent of the total number of generals promoted
during the period.</P>
      <P>Lee Jye, who served as defense minister between May 2004 and May 2007, promoted
the highest number of generals not in conformity with standards, at 35. He was
followed by Tang Yiau-min (February 2002-May 2004) at 22; former Defense
Minister Wu Shih-wen (May 2000-January 2002) at 18; Chiang Chung-ling (December

      <P>Tsai, the last defense minister under the administration of former President
Chen Shui-bian and whose tenure was less than three months, had the highest
ratio of inadequate promotion of generals, with four per month.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council of Agriculture's Fisheries Agency and two fishery associations on
Thursday urged the public to buy low cost fish such as milk fish, Taiwan tilapia
and bass for use as food offerings during the Ghost Festival which falls on Aug.
24 this year.</P>
      <P>Lin Chi-tsang,  the head of Taiwan Provincial  Fishermen's Association, said at
a promotional event in Taipei that fish of around 0.6-kg are usually the most
popular choice for religious rites, and that many of the low-cost seasonal
species come in that size.</P>
      <P>The wholesale price of milk fish is NT$73 per kilogram, about 20-30 percent
lower than it was two months ago, while Taiwan tilapia of the same size cost
NT$30-NT$40 each kg, and bass NT$60-NT$70 each, Lin said.</P>
      <P>In comparison, the price of white pomfret is NT$600 per kg, while corvina of the
same size cost NT$350 each. This price is even higher than the record
NT$170-NT$180 per kg during Chinese New Year over the past few years.</P>
      <P>The price of corvina has risen because of dwindling stocks and a decrease in
imports from China due to increasing demand during the ongoing Shanghai World
Expo, Lin said.</P>
      <P>He therefore encouraged consumers to buy cheaper fish for food offerings during
the festival, saying that the cost will be one-fifth of that of white pomfret.</P>
      <P>Chinese families customarily celebrate Ghost Festival on the 15th day of the
seventh lunar month with food offerings to their ancestors. They also make food
offerings to ghosts in the belief that the spirits will therefore not intrude
into the lives of the living and bring misfortune.</P>
      <P>Fish, pork and chicken are usually the three most common choices of food for
ghost month offerings.</P>

      <P>Soybean prices will remain stable in the coming months thanks to a predicted
bumper crop in September, though with a slight rise resulting from short-term
wheat price volatility, an official of the Taiwan Vegetable Oil Manufacturers
Association said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Yang Ing-Wu, chairman of the association, said the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture has predicted a good U.S. soybean harvest in September, which will
contribute to the stabilization of both soybean and cooking oil prices.</P>
      <P>"The crude oil price and the weather so far have had no major impact on the
cooking oil supply, " said Yang, adding that the upward rise in soybean prices
will decline soon.</P>
      <P>According to the association, the current price of cooking oil is NT$500-600
(US$15.84-US$19.01) per 18-litre barrel on the domestic market.</P>
      <P>Yang said the import price of soybeans rose from US$9.34 to US$10.4 per bushel

      <P>The representative offices in Taiwan of the United States and the European Union
(EU) both took a wait-and-see approach Thursday to an imminent amendment of a
law that would lower the tax on rice wine, which both parties consider a
violation of World Trade Organization (WTO) regulations.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan passed a draft amendment to the Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Law
last month to adjust the tax on rice wine by moving it from the distilled spirit
category to the cooking wine category. The amendment was expected to clear the
Legislative Yuan late Thursday.</P>
      <P>"We will carefully look at new laws or amendments that may conflict with the WTO
obligations of members, particularly any changes that will treat domestic
products more favorably than imported ones. We expect WTO members to act in
accordance with their WTO commitments, " said Sheila Paskman, a spokeswoman of
the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT).</P>
      <P>The European Economic and Trade Office said meanwhile that it will let the EU
Parliament in Brussels handle the EU's official response.</P>
      <P>Under the draft amendment, the tax on a 0.6-liter bottle of rice wine will be
reduced from NT$29.25 (US$0.93) to NT$5.4 and the price of a bottle of rice wine
will be cut to NT$25 from NT$50. The price adjustment has sparked questions in
the U.S. and the EU as to whether it violates the regulations of the WTO, of
which Taiwan is a member.</P>
      <P>Citing public opinion surveys, the government has argued that 96.4 percent of
the population use rice wine solely for cooking rather than drinking, in an
effort to convince the U.S., the EU and other WTO members that lowering rice
wine prices will not have an impact on other types of alcohol.</P>
      <P>Both the U.S. and the EU -- the main producers of brandy and whisky -- fear that
once the price of the kitchen staple is lowered, sales of whisky, brandy and
other varieties of alcohol will be affected.</P>

      <P>Researchers from Academia Sinica's Institute of Biomedical Sciences have
identified a protein that carries vitamin C to muscle cells of the body to help
repair damage and protect against deterioration.</P>
      <P>The researchers said that the findings gave them a better understanding of an
inherited connective tissue disorder called arterial tortuosity syndrome.</P>
      <P>The study was published online in the journal "Human Molecular Genetics" on July
24 and has been highlighted as a "must read" paper by the influential "Faculty
of 1000 Biology" research service.</P>
      <P>The findings of the study may explain long-standing questions about how vitamin
C enters mitochondria, which are the power centers of cells. Mitochondria
provide the energy a cell needs to move, divide, produce secretory products and
contract.</P>
      <P>They are also known to take up and recycle vitamin C. However, up until now,
the molecular mechanisms  of vitamin C uptake by mitochondria have been poorly
understood.</P>
      <P>The research team led by Dr. Yuan-Tsong Chen, identified a carrier protein
called GLUT 10, which is found predominantly in the mitochondria of smooth
muscle cells and insulin-stimulated fat cells.</P>
      <P>They found that GLUT 10 transports oxidized vitamin C to mitochondria, and also
increases their uptake, which strengthens the cells' ability to detoxify and
repair damage.</P>
      <P>These findings provide a mechanism to explain how vitamin C enters mitochondria
and show how abnormalities in GLUT 10 may lead to the abnormalities  found in
arterial tortuosity syndrome,  the researchers said.</P>
      <P>The results also provide new insights into the relationship between GLUT 10 and
type 2 diabetes and reinforce the importance of vitamin C in fighting
degenerative diseases.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>News of a discount bookstore closing branches in Taipei to focus on its plan to
launch an online store highlights the impact on the industry from competition on
the Internet.</P>
      <P>The Cheng Da Bookstore will close both of its Taipei branches near National
Taiwan Normal University and National Taiwan University at the end of October
and is working with Terry Chang, founder of Taiwan's first online bookstore --
books.com.tw -- on its online venture.</P>
      <P>The bookstore's physical presence will be reduced to its two branches in
southern Taiwan's Kaohsiung City.</P>
      <P>Publishing industry sources said Cheng Da's Taipei branches are market
indicators because of their good sales performance. If the move shows the market
trend leaning toward the Internet, the outlook is not bright for smaller
players.</P>
      <P>Taipei's "book street" -- the section between the Presidential Office and the
railway station on Chongqing South Road -- is feeling the most impact.</P>
      <P>"Bookstores used to fill Chongqing South road but have been closing one by one
in recent years. The books that keep the remaining stores open are books for
exams or those in simplified Chinese," said Liu Chien-yu, chief editor of Socio
Publishing Co., Ltd.</P>
      <P>Facing the tough market, independent bookstores are diversifying to offer more
to their customers such as holding lectures or selling coffee.</P>
      <P>Specialization  is another approach.  The owner of A-Wei's Bookstore near
Taipei's "book street" decided to sell second-hand books as he had bought many
unwanted books cheaply from his customers.</P>
      <P>According to Liu, bricks-and-mortar shops still have a place in the future and
he said that whether virtual or not, both kinds of bookstores have their
different appeals for consumers. He used the development between physical and
electronic books to explain his prediction.</P>
      <P>"Perhaps physical books in the end will become luxuries and collectors' items as
they were in the past when knowledge was not widely available, " Liu said. "It
will probably be a reflection of social status for people in the future to go to
bookstores and buy books once online distribution is the norm."</P>

      <P>Lawmakers of different parties at the Legislative Yuan approved unanimously
Thursday the revision of three acts to allow Chinese students to study in
Taiwanese colleges.</P>
      <P>Lawmakers of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) , which balk at
any idea of fostering closer ties with China, gave up their opposition to the
revision after their counterparts from the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) agreed to
write into law three limitations insisted upon by the DPP.</P>
      <P>The three limitations are refusing accreditation of diplomas issued by Chinese
medical schools, a ban on Chinese students enrolling in departments  closely
related to Taiwan's national security, and a ban on people without Taiwanese
nationality taking national  examinations  to  work  as government  employees
or professionals.</P>
      <P>The first condition is aimed mainly at preventing local people who graduate from
Chinese medical schools from practicing in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Around 20,000 local people have already graduated from Chinese colleges despite
local authorities' refusal to accredit Chinese diplomas, about 25 percent of
whom have graduated in medicine, mainly traditional Chinese medicine.</P>
      <P>The second and third limitations are intended to deny Chinese students access to
Taiwan's security studies or to serve in Taiwan either as civil servants or as
professionals in the private sector.</P>
      <P>The revisions prompted a free-for-all between the ruling and opposition
lawmakers when it was first debated at the legislature in July.</P>
      <P>A further DPP request to prohibit Chinese students from working even part-time
while studying in Taiwan was nixed by the KMT on the grounds that a similar
prohibition is already provided for in the Act Governing the Relations Between
the People of the Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area.</P>
      <P>Instead, the two parties split their differences by passing a resolution along
with the revision saying that Chinese students cannot work part-time in line
with the prohibition stipulated in the earlier act.</P>
      <P>The revisions have cleared the legal obstacles  for local colleges, especially
local graduate schools, to accept Chinese students, although the Ministry of
Education (MOE) has not yet laid down detailed regulations for the program.</P>
      <P>An education official who spoke on condition of anonymity said the accreditation
of diplomas will not be applied retroactively, which means that Taiwanese
students who studied and earned degrees in China before the revision was passed
still will not have their qualifications recognized in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"It is the opinion of the majority during various public hearings we have held
that we should not reward people who jump the gun, " the official said.</P>
      <P>However, those who earned their Chinese diplomas before the regulations might be
able to get local certification by taking an examination administered by the
government exclusively for them, the official said.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the official went on, the MOE will accredit only the top Chinese
colleges covered by a Chinese program formulated in 1998 to develop them into
internationally recognized ones.</P>
      <P>However, the National University of Defense Technology in Harbin, in
Heilongjiang Province will be excluded from the 39 colleges under the Chinese
program, while the Beijing Sport University, the Central Conservatory of Music
and the China Central Academy of Fine Arts, all in Beijing, will be added to the
list to make a total of 41 recognized colleges, according to the officials.</P>
      <P>The administration of President Ma Ying-jeou has pushed hard for the policy of
allowing Chinese students to study in Taiwan, saying that it will not only
promote exchanges between the two sides and encourage Chinese students to
develop sympathy for Taiwan, but will also help many local colleges plagued with
a shortage of students to find students from China.</P>

      <P>Chinese students will be able to study in Taiwanese universities for doctorates
or masters degrees from March next year at the earliest, the Ministry of
Education (MOE) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan approved earlier that same day three amendments to the Law
Governing Relations Between the People in the Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area,
the University Law and the College Law, paving the way for the admission of
Chinese students into local tertiary education institutions.</P>
      <P>MOE officials said local universities intending to enroll Chinese students in
masters or doctoral programs should submit their plans before December,  which
should include information on faculty, hardware and software facilities, to be
screened in accordance with the regulations governing Chinese students'
recruitment and their stays in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The regulations are scheduled to be promulgated by the MOE next month.</P>
      <P>MOE said a joint recruitment committee will be set up by next July to deal with
issues related to applications, examinations and admissions of Chinese students.</P>
      <P>The committee will also be responsible for admitting Chinese students for
undergraduate programs according to their scores in China's university entry
exam.</P>
      <P>As China usually holds its annual university entry exam in early June,  this
means Chinese students cannot apply for Taiwanese undergraduate studies until
their scores in next year's exam are available, usually in August.</P>
      <P>The relevant universities themselves are authorized to handle their own
recruitment of Chinese masters and doctorate students.</P>
      <P>Expressing appreciation for the legislative passage of the revised laws, the
associations of national universities, private universities and colleges and
private technology colleges called for broader educational exchanges between the
two sides of the Taiwan Strait by allowing universities to set up offices on
either side to help smooth recruitment and academic cooperation.</P>
      <P>In Beijing, a spokesman for the Taiwan Affairs Office under China's State
Council expressed welcome for the move, but said Chinese students in Taiwan
should not be discriminated against.</P>

      <P>An air traffic controller at Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport who nearly
caused a collision between a cargo plane and a passenger flight in July has been
moved to another post and is receiving counseling, an official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>"The controller, who had been working in the airport control tower for slightly
more than a year, was scared by his own mistake and feels deeply remorseful,"
the official said.</P>
      <P>In the hope of helping him overcome the trauma and work well in his new post, he
said, the airport administration has assigned a psychology instructor to offer
counseling to the controller.</P>
      <P>The "near miss" took place July 15 when a Ukrainian cargo plane nearly collided
with a Singapore Airlines (SIA) passenger flight at the airport -- Taiwan's main
gateway -- because the Ukrainian pilot reportedly misunderstood the air traffic
controller's order.</P>
      <P>The Ukrainian plane was moving forward as it received an order to wait until the
SIA flight carrying more than 200 passengers had taken off. However, the pilot
misunderstood the order "hold short of runway 05" as "cross runway 05." As the
cargo plane moved forward, another air traffic controller saw the danger and
ordered it to speed up so it could be out of the way when the SIA plane started
taking off.</P>
      <P>Local media reports said the two planes came to within 1,100 meters of each
other, or 11 seconds away from a collision. However, the Singapore daily Lianhe
Wanbao quoted an SIA executive as saying Thursday that its crew had noticed the
Ukrainian plane on the runway and decided to delay takeoff until after the
Ukrainian plane had left runway. The SIA executive insisted that the "near miss"
reports were not true as there was no dangerous scenario at all.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, an airport management investigation showed that the first air
controller should have made certain that the Ukrainian pilot had understood his
order and should also have used visual contact or radar to confirm the plane's
position.</P>
      <P>"The presence of two planes on the same runway violated the most fundamental
rule" of air traffic control, the airport official pointed out.</P>
      <P>The controller will be disciplined, he went on, adding that the airport
administration's disciplinary panel is scheduled to meet next week to mete out a
penalty.</P>
      <P>The incident followed a host of problems and scandals afflicting the airport,
including leaking restrooms, poor facilities, awful and expensive food and staff
misconduct.</P>

      <P>The Legislative Yuan approved a cut in the tax on rice wine from NT$29.5
(US$0.93) per 600 c.c bottle to NT$5.4 Thursday.</P>
      <P>The move is expected to bring the price of local rice wine from NT$50 per bottle
to NT$25.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Finance said that although the cut is expected to increase the
sale of the wine from 7.5 million bottles per year to 210 million -- the amount
before the NT$29.5 tax was imposed -- it is set to cost the government NT$1.47
billion in tax revenue.</P>
      <P>Also that day, the Legislative Yuan approved a change to the redistricting of
lawmaker's constituencies from every four years to every 10 years.</P>
      <P>The move, initiated by the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) , drew mild opposition from
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), with some of the lawmakers questioning the
constitutionality of the revision.</P>
      <P>The KMT-controlled legislature also approved a revision to a law that strips
former presidents or vice presidents of the privilege of enjoying a government
allowance if they are found guilty of rebellion, treason or corruption at a
first trial.</P>
      <P>The privilege, however, will be reinstated if they are eventually cleared of the
charges, according to the revision.</P>
      <P>Before the change, former presidents and vice presidents would lose their
privilege only after having been found guilty and having exhausted all avenues
of appeal.</P>
      <P>The change was opposed by the DPP on the grounds that it was obviously targeted
at ex-President Chen Shui-bian, who is being detained while on trial for
corruption but who otherwise still enjoys the privileges extended to an ex-chief
of state.</P>
      <P>In still another law revision that same day, the legislature approved a change
to the Organic Law of the Presidential Office to strike off payments to senior
advisors to the president and national policy advisors to the president, both of
which are mainly ceremonial posts.</P>
      <P>However, the number of such advisors was kept intact at 30 and 90, respectively.</P>
      <P>The change was initiated by the administration of President Ma Ying-jeou, which
had already stopped payment to the two types of advisors from last year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>China Times: Turn paperwork, lip service into concrete achievements</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>08/20/10  10:35:38
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Despite tedious filibusters and other procedural pole-greasing from the
opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), the landmark economic cooperation
framework agreement (ECFA) with China has finally cleared the legislative floor.</P>
      <P>The pact is of course no cure-all or panacea, but rather the right choice at a
crucial time. It will usher in a new era in economic exchanges across the Taiwan
Strait and will allow Taiwan to break through its diplomatic isolation and play
a more important role in the process of Asia-Pacific economic integration.</P>
      <P>The ruling Kuomintang has launched an all-out publicity campaign to propagate
the ECFA's merits and benefits, which include creating 250,000 jobs, attracting
US$17.1 billion in inbound investment from around the world and increasing the
annual GDP growth rate by 1.7 percent.</P>
      <P>Summarizing the accord's potential benefits into concrete figures makes it easy
for ordinary people to understand and memorize. Quantitative figures, however,
are less forgettable and easier to compare. People tend to expect more and more.
Whenever the numbers fall a bit short of original expectations, the government
faces the risk of immediate complaints and criticism.</P>
      <P>The ECFA's signing therefore has posed a great challenge to the government. All
public agencies should from now on pull out all the stops to turn written and
verbalized  benefits  into concrete achievements that people can experience in
their everyday lives. Only if action  is substituted  for paperwork  and lip
service  in administrative measures can the deal prove its value. (Editorial

    <HEADLINE>USTR expresses concern over Taiwan rice wine tax cut</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Aug. 19 (CNA)
08/20/10  10:38:26

    <TEXT>
      <P>The U.S. government expressed concern Thursday over the Taiwan legislature's
approval earlier in the day of a tax reduction for rice wine -- a kitchen staple
among Taiwanese consumers.</P>
      <P>"The United States is concerned with the potential market impact of Taiwan's tax
reduction on rice wine, " said an official with the Office of the United States
Trade Representative (USTR) in response to a query from CNA.</P>
      <P>The USTR has already conveyed its concerns about Taiwan's tax cut directly to
the Taiwanese authorities, the official said.</P>
      <P>The United States expects all WTO members to abide by their WTO obligations. It
would be inappropriate to comment on whether this, or any other specific issue,
might be subject to WTO litigation, the USTR said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Legislative Yuan approved a reduction in the tax on rice wine from
NT$29.5 (US$0.93) per 600 c.c bottle to NT$5.4 Thursday. The move is expected to
bring the price of local rice wine from NT$50 per bottle to NT$25.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Finance said that although the cut is expected to increase the
sale of the wine from 7.5 million bottles per year to 210 million -- the amount
before the NT$29.5 tax was imposed -- it is set to cost the government NT$1.47
billion in tax revenue.</P>
      <P>In fact, there is a WTO tax bracket for alcoholic beverages for kitchen use --
which is what over 90 percent of Taiwan's rice wine is made and sold for.
However, rice wine has been taxed as a distilled spirit, and other WTO members
-- principally the U.S. and the European Union -- are under the impression that
reducing the tax on the cooking wine will undercut their sales in Taiwan of
spirits such as whisky and brandy, neither of which are used for cooking in
Chinese cuisine.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Talk of the day -- Taiwan expected to reach 8.24% GDP growth</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>08/20/10  10:49:26
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) revised
upward Taiwan's projected economic growth for 2010 to 8.24 percent Thursday --
the highest level in 21 years -- on the back of strong economic recovery.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from the local media coverage of the issue:</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>According to DGBAS Minister Shih Su-mei, the main reason for the revision is
Taiwan's better-than-expected economic performance in the second quarter, when
growth reached 12.53 percent. This marked the third straight quarter in which
positive growth was recorded and the second consecutive quarter of double-digit
increase.</P>
      <P>Su said both exports and investment by the semiconductor sector beat
expectations.</P>
      <P>An increase in domestic  demand also fueled a big boost, contributing 6.33
percentage points to the growth, she said. (Aug. 20, 2010).</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>The growth  projection  of 8.24 percent  for 2010 is the second-highest among
Asia's "four little dragons, " after Singapore's 13 percent to 15 percent.</P>
      <P>The DGBAS predicted that Taiwan's export volume will hit a record high of
US$271.3 billion this year. Private investment, meanwhile, is expected to
increase by 23.4 percent to reach NT$2 trillion, the highest level since 2004.</P>
      <P>Gross national product per capita is projected at a record high of US$18,565, up
more than US$1,000 from last year.</P>
      <P>Tsai Hung-kun, chief of the DGBAS's Third Department, however, mentioned some
uncertainties that could slow down economic growth in the second half of the
year.</P>
      <P>These include tightening of international  monetary policy, termination of
economic stimulus measures, and tightening measures likely to be adopted by
emerging countries to prevent asset bubbles, he said. (Aug. 20, 2010).</P>
      <P>Commercial Times:</P>
      <P>Tsai said the cross-Taiwan Strait economic cooperation framework agreement is
gradually producing its effect,  with the tariff reduction for China-bound
exports expected to boost Taiwan's economic growth by 0.4 percentage points in
2011.</P>
      <P>The DGBAS forecast a 4.64 percent economic growth for Taiwan in 2011. (Aug. 20,
2010).</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Kuomintang-controlled Legislative Yuan passed three packages of legal
amendments Thursday to pave the way for the opening of local tertiary
educational institutions to Chinese students.</P>
      <P>Although some restrictions, including a ban on enrolling them on security-
sensitive courses and on their participation in civil service exams, have been
imposed, the open-door program still could lead to irredeemable calamity for
Taiwan if the government fails to adopt measures to nip problems in the bud.</P>
      <P>With a common language and similar cultural backgrounds, Chinese students will
find it easier to stay in Taiwan after graduation than their peers from other
countries.</P>
      <P>The government has been unable to effectively address the problems involving
Chinese citizens illegally working in Taiwan through  marriages  of convenience,
and this plight could be exacerbated by the entry of 1,000 to 2,000 Chinese
students into local campuses  around Taiwan every year.  Can our government
effectively manage them?</P>
      <P>If Chinese students take part-time jobs at lower wages that locals are prepared
to accept, they might not only squeeze local students' job opportunities but
could also drive down local wage levels. Are our law enforcement authorities
competent enough to cope with such challenges?</P>
      <P>Most alarming of all, will Chinese students and businessmen operating here get
involved in major political events in Taiwan en masse? Local people should be
prepared for all these potential threats. (editorial abstract -- Aug. 20, 2010).</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan's wealth gap widening: survey</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's household income gap widened in 2009, with the average annual
disposable income of the richest families reaching 6.34 times that of the
poorest, according to the results of a survey released Thursday.</P>
      <P>It was the second-widest gap since 2001, when the average income of the richest
20 percent of local families was 6.39 times that of the poorest 20 percent,
according to the Cabinet-level Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and
Statistics (DGBAS).</P>
      <P>The DGBAS attributed the widening wealth gap in part to the global economic
crunch that fueled record high unemployment in Taiwan last year.</P>
      <P>If social welfare subsidies and tax benefits are excluded, the income gap
between the two groups hit an all-time high of 8.22 times the 2009 average,
DGBAS officials said.</P>
      <P>The survey divides families into five brackets in terms of annual disposable
income, with the top 20 percent defined as the richest and the bottom 20 percent
as the poorest. The largest income gap between these two brackets was 6.39
times, recorded in 2001.</P>
      <P>The latest survey found that the average annual disposable income in the richest
group of families reached NT$1.79 million (US$56,113) in 2009, compared to
NT$282,000 for those in the poorest bracket.</P>
      <P>The average  annual disposable  income in Taiwan stood at NT$888,000 per
household last year, or NT$266,000 per household member, representing year-on-
year declines of 2.9 percent and 2.6 percent, respectively, according to the
DGBAS.</P>
      <P>The average household savings made last year also marked the largest decline of
any year, the survey found.</P>
      <P>The wealth gap was narrowed 1.88 times last year as a result of comprehensive
efforts by the government,  said Christina Liu, chairwoman of the Cabinet-level
Council for Economic Planning and Development.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Liu said, government welfare subsidies and tax breaks would not be
a cure-all in terms of changing the structural fundamental of the gap between
rich and poor.</P>
      <P>"Only when the country's economy is powered by the dual engines of exports and
domestic consumption can the problem of uneven distribution of wealth be
addressed," Liu said.</P>
      <P>"Investing in Taiwan, particularly in the service sector, is the key," she
suggested.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Powerchip to raise 2010 capital expenditure by 40 percent</HEADLINE>

08/20/10  13:15:52

    <TEXT>
      <P>An official of memory chip maker Powerchip Technology Corp. said Friday that the
company has decided to raise its 2010 capital expenditure by about 40 percent
for a production technology upgrade.</P>
      <P>The board of directors has approved the proposal to hike the company's capital
expenditure to NT$17 billion (US$533 million) from the previously planned NT$12
billion, said Powerchip spokesman Eric Tan.</P>
      <P>"We aim to speed up the pace of migrating to the 45 nanometer production process
from the current 63nm, " Tan said, adding that "the technology upgrade is
expected to be completed in the middle of 2011," financed by the additional
funds.</P>
      <P>Tan said that as Powerchip has turned profitable in the first half of this year,
there are no problems for the company meeting the fund demand.</P>
      <P>In the first six months of this year, Powerchip posted NT$10.3 billion
(US$322.65 million) in net profits on a recovery of global demand for dynamic
random access memory (DRAM) chips after a net loss of NT$20.7 billion recorded
for the whole of 2009.</P>
      <P>In 2008, Powerchip incurred NT$57.5 billion in net losses.</P>
      <P>Due to the large  accumulated  net losses,  the Financial Supervisory
Commission in July turned down an application by Powerchip to issue up to US$179
million-worth of global depository receipts.</P>
      <P>Tan said the rejection of the application has had no impact on the plan to hike
its capital expenditure  for the production technology upgrade.</P>
      <P>Michael Chiang, an analyst with Taiwan International Securities, said it is
necessary for DRAM makers to advance their production technology as DRAM prices
are weakening now as the pace of the global economy recovery has appeared to
slow.</P>
      <P>"A higher end production process is expected to cut DRAM makers' operating
costs," Chiang said.</P>
      <P>"With operating costs down, the impact from falling product prices is expected
to be offset," he said.</P>
      <P>Powerchip rivals such as Nanya Technology Corp. and Inotera Memories, Inc. are
also gearing up for technology upgrades for the same purpose, Chiang went on.</P>
      <P>In addition, Powerchip said it will submit a GDR application again at some as-
yet unspecified time.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Apple Daily: Income gap at alarming levels</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>08/20/10  13:22:34
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The prevalence of capitalism around the globe has led to a widening gap between
the rich and the poor. Not only has the gap between  rich and poor countries
become enlarged,  a similar predicament can also be seen in society.</P>
      <P>The latest statistics released by the Cabinet show that the income gap between
Taiwan's richest and poorest households has widened 66 times over the past 11
years.</P>
      <P>In 2008, the average annual income of the top 5 percent wage earners amounted to
NT$4.5 million (US$140,625) , compared to an average of NT$68,000 grossed by
those in the bottom 5 percent bracket. In comparison, the income gap between the
two groups was only 32 times 10 years previously in 1998.</P>
      <P>The 2008-2009 global financial crisis could have contributed to the broadening
of the wealth gap, as more people lost their jobs or saw their wages cut during
the economic recession, while rich people at the pinnacle of the income pyramid
remained intact.</P>
      <P>Even though Taiwan might be able to achieve a 7 percent GDP growth rate this
year, the wealth gap is not expected to narrow much because of the ever-rising
ratio of "triangle trade" in the country's overall foreign trade.</P>
      <P>"Triangle trade" refers to order-taking in Taiwan, production taking  place in
China and goods finally  exported  to third destinations such as America and
Europe.</P>
      <P>The ratio already shot up from 13 percent in 2000 to 50 percent in June this
year. The triangle trade might help drive Taiwan's economic growth rate up, but
only exporting companies and their shareholders will enjoy the fruits, while
most other people and the domestic consumer market will not experience any
positive impact, as revenues from this kind of trade are usually banked abroad.</P>
      <P>In the face of this development, the government should craft a sound tax system
and adjust the tax rate from time to time to ensure more equitable distribution
of wealth while not scaring away investors. Otherwise, the rise of an anti-
mercantile complex could be an ominous sign of social instability. (Editorial

    <HEADLINE>Rice wine issue hinges on international agreement: ex-WTO official</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Brussels,  Aug. 19 (CNA)
08/20/10  13:57:05

    <TEXT>
      <P>A key question in Taiwan's controversial decision to cut the excise tax on rice
wine is whether the move has violated the principle of equal treatment for
imported and locally produced goods, a former World Trade Organization (WTO)
official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Based on that principle, which is laid out in Article III of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the U.S. and European countries believe
that Taiwan's excise tax on imported alcoholic and tobacco products should also
apply to local products, Roderick Abbott, a former deputy director-general of
the WTO, told the CNA.</P>
      <P>Rice wine, which is used as a cooking ingredient in Taiwan, will soon be subject
to a lower excise tax as the Legislative Yuan amended the Tobacco and Alcohol
Tax Act on Thursday to categorize the product as cooking wine, rather than a
distilled spirit.</P>
      <P>At present, distilled spirits are subject to an excise tax of NT$2.5 per liter
of alcohol. The tax on a 0.6-liter bottle of red-label rice wine that contains
19.5 percent alcohol is NT$29.25, if it is taxed as a distilled spirit.</P>
      <P>The excise tax on cooking wines is NT$9 per liter, regardless of their alcohol
levels. Taxing rice wine as a cooking ingredient will drop the excise tax on
red-label rice wine to NT$5.4 per bottle, which will in effect decrease its
price from NT$50 to NT$25 per bottle.</P>
      <P>The matter has raised the concerns among the United States and the European
Union countries.</P>
      <P>The Office of the United States Trade Representative on Thursday said the U.S.
expects that "all WTO members will abide by their WTO obligations." But it
declined to comment on the possibility of WTO litigation over the issue.</P>
      <P>According to Abbott, the WTO does not accept the idea of different  treatment
for alcoholic  products  based  on their ingredients.</P>
      <P>For example, he said, the WTO determines that wheat-based whisky and grape-based
cognac should be subject to the same level of tax because they are both liquor.</P>
      <P>The WTO believes that alcohol level, rather than ingredients, should determine
the tax categories for alcoholic products, he said.</P>

      <P>Taiwan share prices closed little changed Friday as rotational buying lifted old
economy stocks to offset the impact of a Wall Street dive overnight amid global
economic concerns, dealers said.</P>
      <P>The weighted index fell 1.63 points or 0.02 percent to 7,927.31, after moving
between 7,905.01 and 7,941.61 on turnover of NT$101.18 billion (US$3.17
billion).</P>
      <P>The market opened flat, down 1.38 percent, but selling set in immediately to
drag down the index to the day's low because of Wall Street's volatility, the
dealers said.</P>
      <P>However, rotational buying emerged to support the traditional industrial sector
on optimism about their profitability, helping the broader market recoup earlier
losses, they said.</P>
      <P>A total of 1,436 stocks closed up and 2,115 were down, with 292 remaining
unchanged.</P>
      <P>The construction sector posted the highest gains, up 2.5 percent. Cement stocks
rose 0.9 percent, textile shares added 0.7 percent and financial issues gained
0.5 percent.</P>
      <P>The paper and pulp sector closed up 0.3 percent, and the plastics and chemical
sector was 0.1 percent higher, while foodstuffs fell 0.6 percent, and machinery
and electronics stocks ended down 0.4 percent.</P>
      <P>"Buying in old economy stocks was the result of renewed hopes of rising economic
exchanges across the Taiwan Strait after the signing of the major trade pact
with China," Concord Securities analyst Allen Lin said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and China inked the economic cooperation  framework agreement (ECFA) in
late June, paving the way for closer bilateral business ties.</P>
      <P>"The ECFA has prompted investors to speculate that more Chinese funds will enter
the country to boost local commercial property prices, " Lin said,  referring to
the rebound posted by the construction sector.</P>
      <P>"The trade pact is going to deliver a lasting positive impact on the local
economy. The local bourse, therefore, appeared resilient despite a steep fall on
U.S. markets," Lin said.</P>
      <P>However, turnover was reduced as many investors remained on the sidelines, Lin
said.</P>
      <P>"Fears of further jitters on Wall Street kept investors from going on a buying
spree that would have brought the local index out of the current period of
consolidation," Lin said.</P>
      <P>He said investors should cut stock holdings to 50 percent or less in their
portfolios and keep as much cash as they can while waiting for fresh cues to
act.</P>
      <P>In the construction sector, Prince Housing gained 6.91 percent to close at
NT$17.80, Cathay Real Estate rose 5.26 percent to end the day at NT$16.00 and
Kuo Yang Construction added 2.90 percent to finish trading at NT$23.10.</P>
      <P>However, flat panel maker Chimei Innolux fell 1.76 percent to NT$36.30 and PC
vendor Acer lost 2.37 percent to end at NT$82.30 on the latest NASDAQ fall.</P>

      <P>The Republic of China will not squander money on the celebrations to mark its
100th founding anniversary, President Ma Ying-jeou said Friday.</P>
      <P>The budget for the activities that will be held this year and into 2011 will be
roughly NT$3.2 billion (US$100.3 million) , one-sixth of the amount spent on the
2009 World Games in Kaohsiung and about half of the cost of the 2009 Deaflympics
Taipei, Ma said.</P>
      <P>He said he was deeply moved by the many offers by individuals to volunteer their
time to help prepare for the celebrations.</P>
      <P>Over the past 100 years, the Republic of China, founded by Dr. Sun Yat-sen on
the Chinese mainland on Oct. 10, 1911, has weathered political twists and turns
and has grown into a full-fledged democracy and an economic powerhouse based on
Taiwan, Ma said.</P>
      <P>"Today's Taiwan is a model of democratization for all Chinese societies around
the world," he said.</P>
      <P>He said Aug. 20 is a particularly significant date as it marks the founding of
the Chinese Revolutionary League by Sun in 1906. This was the seed that grew

      <P>The Legislative Yuan will not review a bill concerning the introduction of a
second-generation National Health Insurance (NHI) program until next week, a
ruling Kuomintang (KMT) legislator said Friday.</P>
      <P>Lin Yi-shih, who is also director-general of the KMT's Policy Committee, told
reporters that the legislature would take a break Friday because it had been
busy for the previous four days.</P>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan is holding a two-week special session Aug. 17-30 to deal
with a number of priority bills. Items that already cleared the legislative
floor earlier in the week include the economic cooperation framework agreement
with China and several bills regarding the admission of Chinese students to
Taiwanese universities and colleges.</P>
      <P>The proposed amendment to the National Health Insurance Act is the only item on
the agenda that was not reviewed during the session.</P>
      <P>The bill mainly involves a new scheme for calculating premiums based on total
household incomes rather than the existing system, which considers only
individuals' salaries and wages. The change is considered essential to saving
the cash-strapped program.</P>
      <P>Legislators, however, were not optimistic about the bill's passage during the
special session in light of the many controversies involved.</P>
      <P>According  to Huang Sue-ying of the opposition  Democratic Progressive Party,
the legislature should not hurry the bill through without full discussion, given
that there are 26 clauses in the bill that are highly disputable.</P>
      <P>The KMT's Yang Li-huan said resolving the many structural problems regarding the
NHI system is more important than changing the premium calculation method.</P>
      <P>One urgent issue is how to control excessive medical procedures, which are
generating very lucrative profits for medical institutions and leading to
constantly expanding NHI expenditure, Yang said.</P>
      <P>She also urged the Department of Health to compute the cost of keeping the
insurance system operating.</P>
      <P>Lin Hung-chih, a whip of the KMT legislative caucus, said that if the bill fails
to clear the legislature in the special session, he hopes it can be listed as a
priority for the next regular legislative session due to begin in September.</P>

      <P>Opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) legislators said Friday that
Taiwanese people are leading miserable lives under the rule of the Kuomintang.</P>
      <P>Citing six economic and social indices, Kuan Bi-ling, a whip of the DPP
legislative caucus, said at a press conference that the administration of
President Ma Ying-jeou has created more people living technically below the
poverty line than the previous DPP government.</P>
      <P>The levels of substantive wages and salaries have continued to decline, while
the number of people working temporary or dispatch jobs has increased, with
their hourly payments diminishing, according to Kuan.</P>
      <P>She said the unit price of a new property in Taipei City had skyrocketed to
NT$624,000 (US$19,500) per ping (3.3 square meters) of floor space as of July
this year, up from NT$553,000 per ping in 2006.</P>
      <P>"Home buyers should eat nothing and drink nothing for 28 consecutive years to
save enough money for a new apartment in the capital," she claimed.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Wong Chin-chu said meanwhile that general wages and salaries in
Taiwan have not grown for 10 years and that the current monthly average of
substantive salary totals only NT$34,326, the lowest in 11 years.</P>
      <P>The number of unemployed people aged between 45 and 49 totaled 65,000 in 2009,
compared to 39,000 posted in 2008, according to Wong.</P>
      <P>The number of families living under the poverty line stood at 93,000 in 2008, a
figure that soared to 105,000 in 2009 and further to 108,000 by the second
quarter of this year, Wong said.</P>
      <P>"The Ma administration's tax reduction drives have benefited only business
conglomerates," Wong said.</P>

      <P>A task force set up to improve the management of Taiwan Taoyuan International
Airport concluded a review meeting Friday with the consensus that the airport
should prioritize strengthening its policy implementation and addressing human
error issues.</P>
      <P>Chang Yu-hern, head of the task force set up by the Ministry of Transportation
and Communications (MOTC) , said the panel has mapped out plans for improving
airport management, including gathering information on passenger satisfaction by
conducting focus group discussions and public opinion polls among airport
workers.</P>
      <P>According to information collected by the task force, passengers are most
dissatisfied with the airport's 16 service items, including the bad and
overpriced food sold at the airport, defective equipment such as luggage
trolleys and unclear direction signs in the transit area.</P>
      <P>As every member of the task force has been informed of the problems listed in
the report, the most important thing is how to carry out improvement work in
order to enhance the competitiveness of the airport, the country's main gateway.</P>
      <P>Ruling Kuomintang Legislator Luo Shu-lei said the suggestions for resolving up
to 100 problems at the airport raised by airline companies during the meeting
were very helpful, but she also said human factors can help explain why the
problems are there.</P>
      <P>She suggested that the airport management should find out who is responsible for
the problems and remove anyone found to be unsuitable for their position.</P>
      <P>Noting that President Ma Ying-jeou has allocated a lot of money to lift the
airport into the ranks of the world's best, Luo said it is evident that money is
not the problem and that what matters most is how to improve staff management.</P>
      <P>Pointing to a leaking toilet that left part of a terminal flooded and stinking
for several hours earlier this month, Luo said that even though the airport
operations control center must have obtained images of the leak from its video
monitoring system, nobody made a report on the matter, which she said points to
a management problem.</P>
      <P>If the airport fails to address issues of human error, all its efforts go to
improve efficiency will be in vain, she pointed out.</P>

      <P>The output  value  of the local communications equipment sector rose 16 percent
in the second quarter of this year from a year earlier on the back of strong
demand for consumer electronics products, a government report said Friday.</P>
      <P>In the April-June period, increasing demand for cell phones and wireless local
area network (WLAN) related products boosted the overall production value of the
local communications equipment sector to NT$191.5 billion (US$6.0 billion),
according to a quarterly report released by the Industry and Technology
Intelligence Service (ITIS).</P>
      <P>The second quarter figure was also 16.9 percent higher than in the first quarter
of this year, the report said.</P>
      <P>The ITIS is a research institute of the Department of Industrial Technology
under the Ministry of Economic Affairs.</P>
      <P>The report said the output value of the cell phone segment totaled NT$78 billion
in the second quarter of this year, up 34.3 percent from a year earlier and up 8

      <P>Smartphones accounted for more than 70 percent of the production value of the
overall cell phone segment during the period, the ITIS said.</P>

percent from a year earlier, it said.</P>
      <P>The production value of the WLAN segment rose 42.8 percent from a year earlier
and 5 percent from the previous quarter to NT$19.8 billion in Q2, the report
added.</P>
      <P>The digital subscriber line consumer premise equipment (DSL CPE) segment totaled
NT$12.7 billion during the period, up 12.4 percent from a year earlier and also
up 16.5 percent from the first quarter, the ITIS said.</P>
      <P>Rising demand for smartphones is expected to further lift production value of

      <P>An association of Taiwanese students studying in China threatened Friday to take
legal action against a newly approved package of legal amendments  that restrict
the recognition of medical diplomas conferred by schools in China.</P>
      <P>Chen Cheng-teng, deputy head of the Taiwan Student Union (TWSU) said the
restrictions will prevent Taiwanese graduates of Chinese medical colleges from
working in Taiwan in the coming years.</P>
      <P>"Such a restriction seriously infringes upon their legitimate rights as Republic
of China citizens to work," Chen said.</P>
      <P>In contrast to Taiwan's recognition of accreditation of medical schools in other
countries around the world, the restrictions on the recognition of Chinese
medical diplomas also violates the principle of administrative fairness, Chen

newly passed regulations  that ban retroactive recognition of accreditation by

      <P>Environmental activists rallied outside the Control Yuan Friday, asking the
government watchdog to censure two agencies over alleged safety problems at a
nuclear power plant being built in northern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The activists  blamed the state-run  Taiwan  Power Company (Taipower) and the
top nuclear power regulatory body, the Atomic Energy Council (AEC), for the
frequent occurrence of accidents during the construction of the fourth nuclear
power plant in Taipei County's Gongliao Township.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Environmental Protection Union Chairman Wang Chun-shou urged that work on
the plant be suspended until its design and installment flaws are corrected,
expressing particularly strong opposition to a trial run with nuclear fuel rods
at the end of this year.</P>
      <P>The government hopes the plant can begin operating commercially by Oct. 10, 2011
to coincide with the Republic of China's 100th anniversary, but environmental
groups fear the target date could jeopardize safety.</P>
      <P>Wang denounced the year-end trial as a "political show, " devised after Premier
Wu Den-yih expressed the hope that the plant would open on the country's
anniversary rather than at the end of the year as originally planned.</P>
      <P>He said environmental protection organizations have exposed many construction
flaws in the plant -- the fourth built in Taiwan -- including "deliberately
changing the original designs and lowering the safety standards of the plant's
parts.</P>
      <P>"In the face of these public concerns, however, Taipower appears to have ignored
them and continues to hastily build the facility, " Wang charged.</P>
      <P>He also accused the AEC of being negligent in its duty to monitor the
construction of the nuclear power plant, allowing Taipower to conduct tests
despite reports of accidents caused by mechanical failure in recent months.</P>
      <P>Local media reported that a major blackout occurred at the plant on July 9 with
some 300,000 people gathered at a beach 200 meters away for the 2010 Hohaiyan
Rock Festival.</P>
      <P>Taipower later admitted at a meeting to review the accident that the company
would not have been able to conduct an emergency evacuation of the massive
crowds if it had been necessary, the reports said.</P>
      <P>In response to the protest, Taipower executives admitted that "problems" have
happened during tests on the new facility but insisted they could not be
described as "accidents."</P>
      <P>Taipower explained that the goal of the tests is to discover problems, and that
the so-called "accidents" reported by the media were all "problems" unearthed by
the company itself in its pursuit of absolute nuclear safety and quality.</P>
      <P>Construction of the power plant was temporarily suspended in 2000 during the
previous DPP administration in line with then-President Chen Shui-bian's
campaign promise to create a nuclear-free Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The suspension, however, was lifted in early 2001 after the administration came
under pressure from the legislature and segments of society. A consensus was
reached that the fourth nuclear plant would be the last one built in Taiwan.</P>

Friday, but little else was revealed about the event that is being cloaked in

Keelung River will include fireworks, a flower exhibition and visual arts.</P>
      <P>But one of the highlights will be when those at the park get to enjoy Alishan's
famous scenic sunrise on the 200-meter wide water screen and listen to
aboriginal music at the same time, the creative director said.</P>
      <P>The event, which is being organized by the Council for Cultural Affairs and

Taiwan's diversity and creativity to the international community, and evoke a
sense of national spirit that will help Taiwanese courageously launch the
country's next 100 years.</P>

political and controversial legislation will certainly widen the confrontation
between the ruling and opposition camps."</P>
      <P>Chen Chih-chung, the son of the detained former president and a candidate for
the Kaohsiung City Council, called the amendment "vindictive" and said the move
violated the principle of presumed innocence.</P>
      <P>He also said that the amendment will cost the family dearly, as medical bills
for his mother, who has been paralyzed from the waist down since 1985, are
nearly NT$200,000 per month, and he is busy with campaign activities.</P>
      <P>Chen Shui-bian's office will also face closure due to lack of funds, he said.</P>
      <P>"The KMT has taken the vindictive move for the sake of the municipality
elections, " he said, urging voters to speak with their ballots in the year-end
elections.</P>
      <P>The legislative revision of the statute was cleared during an extra session of
the legislature on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Originally, only former presidents and vice presidents convicted of sedition or
treason would have their benefits scrapped. Chen, even though he has been
convicted of corruption in the first and second trials and is presently being
detained, has still received the benefits and preferential treatment accorded
all former presidents.</P>
      <P>But under the amended law, former leaders convicted of corruption in the first
trial will be stripped of a monthly payment of NT$250,000 and personnel and
other miscellaneous fees that amount to NT$8 million in the first year after
stepping down, NT$7 million in the second year, and NT$6 million in the third
year. Between the fourth and eighth years, the amount averages NT$5 million
annually.</P>
      <P>Security escorts will also be cut from the present eight to 12 guards to two or
three.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIEX to hit 10,000 points in 'golden decade': CLSA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  20 (CNA)

(By Chang Liang-chih and Frances Huang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan Stock Exchange Index (TAIEX) will likely hit the 10,000 point mark
and stay above that level in the "golden decade" between 2010-2019 amid
improving business ties across the Taiwan Strait, according to a CLSA Asia-
Pacific Markets report released Thursday.</P>
      <P>The report said the market began a turnaround after President Ma Ying-jeou of
the China-friendly Kuomintang (KMT) took office in May 2008 by beating the pro-
independence Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in the presidential elections.</P>
      <P>On his second anniversary in office in May, Ma outlined a vision to build a
"golden decade" for Taiwan's economic development by pushing for innovation,
culture and environmental protection, while promising to enhance social welfare
and promote peace with China to protect the island.</P>
      <P>"The (KMT's) victory...sparked a positive turnaround in the Taiwan Stock
Exchange Index after it had been among the worst performers in emerging markets
over the previous decade, " the report said.</P>
      <P>"While a cyclical downturn brings down our short term target to 6,800 (points) ,
we believe the index will undergo a phase shift, surpass and stay above 10,000
in the coming decade," it added.</P>
      <P>The index closed at 7,927.31 on Friday.</P>
      <P>The report said Taiwan has moved from a concept of "capital links" in which the
island and China were expected to establish full economic ties, to the beginning
of a payoff stage, in particular after the signing of the economic cooperation
framework agreement (ECFA) with the mainland in late June.</P>
      <P>With closer capital links with China, CLSA said, Taiwan will see "tremendous
economic benefits" as the ECFA will grant it preferential status in tariff
reductions and easier market access for 539 kinds of Taiwanese merchandise and
services.</P>
      <P>The trade pact is expected to serve as a springboard to signing further economic
agreements with other countries as well, it said.</P>
      <P>"We are excited about the possibility of a golden decade for Taiwan over
2010-19," the report said.</P>
      <P>"We also believe this Capital Links-led outperformance will allow the benchmark
(index) to overcome strong historical resistance, enabling it to surpass and
remain above 10,000 points for most of this golden decade," it added.</P>
      <P>In the report, CLSA recommended a buy on Asia Cement, Chinatrust Financial,
China Airlines, EVA Airways, Far Eastern New Century, Huaku Development,
President Chain Store, Uni-President Enterprises and Taiwan Fertilizer when the
index hits a predicted cyclical downturn in the fourth quarter of this year or
the first quarter of next year.</P>

      <P>Batteries recycled through a school program during the 2009-2010 school year
amounted to 402 metric tons, the Environmental Protection Administration (EPA)
said Friday.</P>
      <P>The EPA, which helped launch the project seven years ago to teach children the
importance of minimizing waste, said the average battery recycling rate between
2007 and 2009 reached 48 percent, passing the European Union's minimum battery
collection target of 45 percent by 2016.</P>
      <P>Among the 3,041 schools participating in the program in the 2009-2010 school
year, 140 schools made the distinguished list and 56 schools will be awarded up
to NT$100,000 (US$3,125), said Lee Shou-chien, department director of the
Recycling Fund Management Board.</P>
      <P>There were 238 more schools and 25,000 more students taking part in the
recycling program than in the previous year, said the EPA, adding that 75
percent of the schools around the island were actively involved.</P>
      <P>The EPA urged schools to continue promoting the zero waste concept and education

      <P>Four unused ammunition depots on a small islet in Penghu County built during
Japanese colonial rule should be rehabilitated and turned into new tourist
attractions, three Control Yuan members said Friday.</P>
      <P>The three members -- Lee Ping-nan, Yu Teng-fang and Chou Yang-shan -- made the
recommendation after completing an extensive study of the century-old ammunition
depots in Penghu's remote Siyu township near Nisin Bay in the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Three of the depots, built close together on the islet, had bronze plates as
their inner walls and were equipped with airtight windows and two iron gates at
each of their entrances.</P>
      <P>Those features had led some to believe that the depots were toxic gas chambers
or biochemical weapon research labs, Lee said, but an extensive study showed the
speculation to be unfounded because their design and equipment did not live up
to the standards for such facilities.</P>
      <P>Moreover, samples of air, soil, water and 10 other items collected at the
location did not test positive for traces of any toxic gases or chemicals, he
added.</P>
      <P>After extensive discussion with military historians and ancient ammunition
experts, Lee said they concluded that the three depots were used to store
smokeless ammunition.</P>
      <P>"They have existed since 1907 when Taiwan was under Japanese colonial rule, "
Lee said, noting that they are the only depots of their kind ever to be found in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>After World War II, the Republic of China government took control of the depots,
which continued to serve as depots for a nearby army base and are now abandoned.</P>
      <P>There is another abandoned depot in their vicinity, which was also built by the
Japanese during their period of colonial rule, Lee said. The depot has brick
outer walls and wooden inner walls and its floor stands one meter high, a design
believed to be helpful in fighting humidity.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, cultural heritage experts from the Council for Cultural
Affairs and the Penghu County government who joined his team in surveying the
four structures agreed that the depots should be designated national historic
sites subject to special protection for their historical and cultural value.</P>
      <P>"Given their rarity, special architectural features and building technologies,
they should be preserved and refurbished to serve as tourist attractions and as
a resource for studying World War II history, " Lee said.</P>
      <P>He said the Ministry of National Defense has agreed to transfer control of the
four structures to the Penghu County government.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lee said his team is also looking for the remains of a Japanese naval
base in Penghu used to train suicidal commandos during the final years of World
War II.</P>

      <P>Young international volunteers from South Korea, Hungary and Hong Kong learned
to make brooms after helping with farmwork Friday at a community in Changhua

      <P>A young Hungarian woman, identified only by her first name Reka, said that
although brooms were common in her country, it was "new and exciting" to see the
straw brooms at the volunteers' workstation in the Sishih community of the

      <P>Twenty-two  domestic and foreign volunteers  at the Sishih workstation organized

      <P>On Friday, senior residents gave the group a lesson on how to make straw brooms.</P>
      <P>While the well-practiced locals finished brooms in less than five minutes, most

      <P>Environmentalists and academics urged the Formosa Plastics Group (FPG) Friday to
assume its social role by quickly heeding protesters' complaints after a blaze
broke out in late July at a company refinery in Yunlin County's Mailiao Township
-- the second of its kind in a month.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Environmental Protection Union representatives, academics and legislators
Tien Chiu-chin and Liu Chien-kuo issued the call at a news conference at the
Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the government must not ignore the increased environmental
pressure facing the country,  they called for a moratorium on heavily polluting
projects, including the planned expansion of FPG's Mailiao facility and another
major petrochemical plan in Changhua County.</P>
      <P>They also asked the FPG to adequately respond to Mailiao residents' demands
after the latest fire at its No. 6 naphtha cracker.</P>
      <P>FPG's sixth naphtha cracker has long enjoyed government-supported advantages,
including low-cost water, low-interest bank loans and the use of industrial
wharfs, said National Taiwan University Professor Shih Shin-min, adding that it
is time for the group to give back to local residents.</P>
      <P>Instead of resorting to lengthy legal procedures to solve disputes, he suggested
FPG and local residents establish a mechanism for dealing with pollution-related
matters and disputes.</P>
      <P>The recent fire triggered anger among Mailiao residents, who have long endured
pollution, contamination and a string of public security threats over the past
decade.</P>
      <P>The company  has offered  a combined  NT$500  million  in compensation, but
local residents have demanded NT$30,000 each -- about NT$1.8 billion in total.</P>
      <P>Earlier the same day, local residents staged a protest for the fourth straight
day, blocking two roads to the complex and causing traffic chaos during the
morning rush hour. Some carried mock coffins to the site.</P>
      <P>Vehicles were backed up for about one kilometer along the roads from 6:30-8:30
a.m. before the protesters dispersed.</P>
      <P>A committee of residents from neighboring Sihu Township issued a six-point
statement calling for, among other things, the opening of stations to monitor

(Wealth Magazine 352)(translated by Kay Liu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A high-tech business tycoon has turned two special varieties of pineapples grown
in his hometown in central Taiwan into a snack that has been selling like hot
cakes over the past year.</P>
      <P>Hsu Ming-ren, chairman of Asian Information Technology Inc., has used Taiwan's
No. 2 and No. 3 variety of Smooth Cayenne pineapples grown in Nantou County as
the key ingredient to make "Sunnyhills" pineapple cakes, which closely resemble
the fruit's natural flavor.</P>
      <P>The snack emerged as an instant success and has attracted a huge following.
Among its fans are Hon Hai Group Chairman Terry Gou and BenQ Group Chairman K.
Y. Lee, who have made "Sunnyhills" pineapple cakes one of their companies' major
gift items.</P>
      <P>While free giveaways have allowed the brand to gain visibility by word of mouth,
Hsu believes the quality local ingredients are also an important factor in the
brand's success.</P>
      <P>"The filling of most pineapple cakes on the market is mixed with winter melon.
But we use only Smooth Cayenne pineapple, which is sweet but also naturally
sour," he said.</P>
      <P>The "Sunnyhills" plant uses 10,000 pineapples a day now compared to 2,000 a day
last year, and the amount could rise further once the company's new factory is
completed. The current facility employs 70-80 people.</P>
      <P>"We have bought up most of the pineapples in Nantou and are now buying more from
Taiwan's southern counties of Tainan and Pingtung. Our current production barely
meets local market demand, " said Hsu Sheng-ming, Hsu Ming-ren's younger brother
who is in charge of daily operations, in explaining why the company has not been
able to expand abroad as planned.</P>
      <P>With its remote production location, the company does most of its business
through phone orders or selling online, typical of recent market trends. Only in
July did the company finally open a shop in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Besides pineapple cakes, Sunnyhills has teamed up with Taiwan's Challenge
Bioproducts Co., Ltd. to develop health foods using bromelain -- pineapple
enzymes that can be extracted from the stems that are discarded while processing
the fruit.</P>
      <P>Challenge Bioproducts is supplying the enzyme, known for its anti-inflammatory
effects,  to  global  drug  company  Teva Pharmaceutical's MultiWound unit for
its Debrase gel dressing that can remove damaged skin tissue from serious burn
wounds.</P>
      <P>The gel dressing, which is aiming to become an alternative to the surgical
method currently used to remove damaged skin tissue, is now undergoing phase III
clinical trials in the United States.</P>
      <P>Challenge Bioproducts said it was the high quality enzyme from Taiwan's Smooth
Cayenne pineapples that enabled Sunnyhills to become its exclusive supplier,
beating competitors in Thailand.</P>
      <P>"Sunnyhills is a career worth investing in and has the potential to surpass my
business of distributing electronic components, " Hsu Ming-ren said, in talking
about how he believes that through dedication the business can stand out among
its competitors.</P>

      <P>Tsai Chia-chen, a female drummer on the team, said that even though she is not
as strong as her male counterparts, she loves the competition and will do her
best to make the country proud.</P>
      <P>Captain Su Pai-chuan said that the Australian and the U.K. teams won the
previous two games because foreigners tend to be more fit and most had solid
backgrounds in canoeing.</P>
      <P>He added, however, that his team was more diligent and had been undergoing

      <P>According to Su, the team will bring a "special weapon" with them to the game --

      <P>The task force reached the decision after holding extensive discussions with 24
business executives in the hotel, management, catering, travel and other related
professional fields as well as noted culinary and travel writers.</P>
      <P>The team also suggested that the Taoyuan airport, the country's main gateway,

      <P>It further said the airport should develop itself into a "small yet beautiful"

      <P>The task force was assembled by the Ministry of Transportation and

      <P>Kaohsiung County Magistrate Yang Chiu-hsin on Friday accused "certain political
figures" of being anti-business, saying that he would take it upon himself to
solicit businesses to invest in the southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Yang was apparently referring to his Yunlin counterpart, Su Chih-fen, who he
suggested had "set a bad example" by leading protesters against the Formosa
Plastics Group (FPG) and asking for huge compensation in the wake of two fires
at its petrochemical complex in Mailiao, Yunlin last month.</P>
      <P>"Political figures and parties cannot act so strongly against the businesses or
they will drive business away," he said.</P>
      <P>He said a local government head should play the role of "coordinator, " adding
that when several industrial incidents took place in his county, he dealt with
them keeping "industrial safety, environmental protection, business survival and
public interests" in mind.</P>
      <P>He urged the public not to turn against the businesses when attaching importance
to environmental protection.</P>
      <P>He said Kaohsiung's economy has been slow over the past decade, and that if it
can develop its economy, then many Kaohsiung residents won't have to leave their
hometown to make a living.</P>
      <P>He lauded Hon Hai Group, headed by Terry Gou, saying that a fund under the group
opened an organic farm to help flood victims in the wake of Typhoon Morakot in
August 2009.</P>
      <P>He expressed hope that Hon Hai will set up its operations and cloud computing
centers in Kaohsiung and said he would continue to solicit Hon Hai's investment
in the southern Taiwan city and county.</P>
      <P>In response, the DPP said it could not agree with Yang's remarks and dismissed
them as a "campaign gambit."</P>
      <P>Earlier this month, Yang announced his intention to run as an independent for
mayor of Kaohsiung municipality after failing to get a nomination from the DPP.</P>
      <P>"If the same incidents took place at FPG's plant in Renwu Township, Kaohsiung
County, Yang would not have made such a remark, " DPP spokesman Lin Yu-chang
said.</P>
      <P>Lin said that for Yunlin residents, the two fires last month are a big issue,
and that the fears among them "can't be easily understood by outsiders."</P>
      <P>The DPP is confident in Su's coordination efforts with the residents, the
government and the business group, Lin said.</P>
      <P>Su said that residents of Yunlin and Kaohsiung counties have "different values
and demands" of their chiefs, adding that if Kaohsiung County residents ask Yang
to do certain things, Yang would also have to comply.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  an environmental  group accused Yang Friday of malfeasance for
allegedly covering up for an amusement park in his county.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Kaohsiung County Magistrate Yang Chiu-hsin on Friday accused "certain political
figures" of being anti-business, saying that he would take it upon himself to
solicit businesses to invest in the southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Yang was apparently referring to his Yunlin counterpart, Su Chih-fen, who he
suggested had "set a bad example" by leading protesters against the Formosa
Plastics Group (FPG) and asking for huge compensation in the wake of two fires
at its petrochemical complex in Mailiao, Yunlin last month.</P>
      <P>"Political figures and parties cannot act so strongly against the businesses or
they will drive business away," he said.</P>
      <P>He said a local government head should play the role of "coordinator, " adding
that when several industrial incidents took place in his county, he dealt with
them keeping "industrial safety, environmental protection, business survival and
public interests" in mind.</P>
      <P>He urged the public not to turn against the businesses when attaching importance
to environmental protection.</P>
      <P>He said Kaohsiung's economy has been slow over the past decade, and that if it
can develop its economy, then many Kaohsiung residents won't have to leave their
hometown to make a living.</P>
      <P>He lauded Hon Hai Group, headed by Terry Gou, saying that a fund under the group
opened an organic farm to help flood victims in the wake of Typhoon Morakot in
August 2009.</P>
      <P>He expressed hope that Hon Hai will set up its operations and cloud computing
centers in Kaohsiung and said he would continue to solicit Hon Hai's investment
in the southern Taiwan city and county.</P>
      <P>In response, the DPP said it could not agree with Yang's remarks and dismissed
them as a "campaign gambit."</P>
      <P>Earlier this month, Yang announced his intention to run as an independent for
mayor of Kaohsiung municipality after failing to get a nomination from the DPP.</P>
      <P>"If the same incidents took place at FPG's plant in Renwu Township, Kaohsiung
County, Yang would not have made such a remark, " DPP spokesman Lin Yu-chang
said.</P>
      <P>Lin said that for Yunlin residents, the two fires last month are a big issue,
and that the fears among them "can't be easily understood by outsiders."</P>
      <P>The DPP is confident in Su's coordination efforts with the residents, the
government and the business group, Lin said.</P>
      <P>Su said that residents of Yunlin and Kaohsiung counties have "different values
and demands" of their chiefs, adding that if Kaohsiung County residents ask Yang
to do certain things, Yang would also have to comply.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  an environmental  group accused Yang Friday of malfeasance for
allegedly covering up for an amusement park in his county.</P>
      <P>E-DA World released tens of thousands of tons of polluted water into the Gaoping
River, a major source of drinking water for residents of greater Kaohsiung,
polluting the drinking water of Kaohsiung residents, an official of the Taiwan
Water Resources Conservation Alliance alleged.</P>

(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Data released Thursday by the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and
Statistics (DGBAS) show that Taiwan's economic growth reached 12.53 percent in
the second quarter, with growth for the whole year expected to hit a 21-year-
high of 8.24 percent.</P>
      <P>Despite these brilliant figures, there are not many things that are worth
celebrating by common people.</P>
      <P>First, the double-digit growth is mainly the result of the lower basis for
comparison, and overseas production activities by Taiwanese businesses could
also distort their contribution to the country's economy.</P>
      <P>Second, statistics issued on the same day by the DGBAS indicate that the income
gap between the richest 20 percent of families in Taiwan and the poorest 20
percent rose to a record 8.22 times in 2009, demonstrating that wealth
distribution is becoming increasingly polarized in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Also, Taiwan's unemployment rate of 5.2 percent remains the highest among Asia's
four little dragons. For those people who have jobs, their real earnings are
inferior to 13 years ago.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the economic performance by the administration of President Ma
Ying-jeou is built upon high indebtedness, with debt issued during his term
expected to reach NT$1.3 trillion by next year. (Editorial abstract -- Aug. 21,

    <HEADLINE>Talk of the day -- Price cut for red-label rice wine imperative</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>08/21/10  13:05:55
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan amended the Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Act on Aug. 19 to cut the price of
locally-produced rice wine -- a kitchen staple for Taiwanese families. The
amendment, however, drew concerns from the United States and European Union
countries.</P>
      <P>While the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative advised Taiwan, being a member
of the World Trade Organization (WTO), to respect WTO regulations, former WTO
Deputy Director-General Roderick Abbott said that the WTO will ponder the issue
based on the question of whether Taiwan has violated the principle of equal
treatment for imported and locally-produced products.</P>
      <P>Facing the dissuasions, Minister of Finance Lee Sush-der said the price cut
concerns local consumers' right and benefits, which he is 100 percent sure will
not be harmed even if Taiwan is eventually ordered to resume the WTO-ruled tax
rate after years of lawsuits within the international economic bloc.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from the local media's coverage of this issue on Aug.
21:</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>The new tax rate on rice wine is expected to take effect in September at the
earliest, Ministry of Finance officials said. Though both the USTR and the
American Institute in Taiwan appeared concerned over the planned tax adjustment,
they have so far not moved to file a complaint with the WTO, the officials
noted.</P>
      <P>State-run Taiwan Tobacco and Liquor President Hsu An-hsuen said the company is
ready to rename the "red-label rice wine" -- used as a cooking wine in Taiwan --
"red-label cooking rice wine, " which will be marketed at the price of NT$25 per
0.6-liter bottle after the amended act on tobacco and liquor tax goes into
effect.</P>
      <P>The red-label rice wine is currently sold at NT$50 per bottle.</P>
      <P>Responding to U.S. concerns, Minister Lee said that it is unfair to levy the
same tax rate on rice wine used for cooking as distilled spirits for drinking,
when the two are used for different purposes. He reiterated that Taiwan has not
violated the WTO's regulations on equal treatment of locally-produced and
imported products.</P>
      <P>Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>Saying the tax reduction proposal was initiated after careful study, Ministry of
Economic Affairs officials underlined that Taiwan did not violate any WTO
regulations.</P>
      <P>If worse comes to worse, Taiwan will resume the original tax rate on the rice
wine if the WTO rules the tax cut is against its regulations, the officials
said.</P>
      <P>The newspaper, however, criticized the move to cut the price of rice wine as an
intentional strategy carried out to "butter up" voters  ahead of the influential
mayoral  elections  of five municipalities in Taiwan in November. (Aug. 21,

      <P>The Kuomintang-dominated Legislative Yuan recently amended a law to strip former
presidents or former vice presidents of their retirement benefits if they are
found guilty of rebellion, treason, or corruption at a first trial.</P>
      <P>The amendment is legally disputable based on the principle of presumed
innocence.</P>
      <P>The blue camp commonly believes that the court's failure to convict corruption-
plagued former President Chen Shui-bian rapidly was responsible for its defeat
in various by-elections over the past year. The blues therefore decided to
penalize Chen on behalf of the court to boost their campaign for the year-end
special municipality elections.</P>
      <P>Such a view is both superficial and flawed.</P>
      <P>Chen's response, on the other hand, is very shameful. He said the amendment will
leave him a beggar after his release from jail. But he was obviously faking a
pitiful situation, in light of the luxurious life led by his family.</P>
      <P>While there was a useless emperor nicknamed "A-tou" in ancient China, there is
now a good-for-nothing former president called "A-bian" in Taiwan. (Editorial

      <P>Flat panel maker AU Optronics Corp. (AUO) said Saturday it expects to set up a
thin-film-transistor liquid crystal display (TFT LCD) module production joint
venture in China with notebook computer contract manufacturer Wistron Corp. by
the end of this year.</P>
      <P>Hsiao Yawen, an AUO spokeswoman, said the investment plan is pending approval
from Taiwanese authorities after the board of directors of both companies gave
the green light to the cooperation.</P>
      <P>"We expect the investment plan will be realized by the end of this year if we
obtain regulatory approval," Hsiao said.</P>
      <P>AUO and Wistron, which is the manufacturing arm of Taiwanese PC vendor Acer
Inc., have agreed to set up the joint venture in the Zhongshan Torch Hi-tech
Industrial Development Zone of southern China's Guangdong province.</P>
      <P>The joint venture is expected to be capitalized at no more than US$10 million,
with AUO to take a 51 percent stake and Wistron to hold the remaining 49
percent.</P>
      <P>The new plant, which is tentatively named Zhongshan BriVision Optronics Corp.,
will be located in the "Wistron Optical Campus" of the Zhongshan industrial
zone.</P>
      <P>"The new business model of allying with one of the world's leading ODM
manufacturers will hopefully help not only broaden customer base, but also
provide in-time and value-added services for customers by joining the strengths
from both sides, " AUO said in a statement on its website.</P>
      <P>Before the joint venture with Wistron, AUO had worked with several Chinese
electronics giants, such as Sichuan Changhong Group, TCL Corp., and Haier Group,
to build flat panel module plants on the mainland.</P>
      <P>Along with AUO's own plants, the company is currently operating TFT LCD module
production plants in eastern China, southern China, northern China and
southwestern China.</P>
      <P>In the second quarter of this year, Taiwan ranked as the top TV panel supplier
to China by taking 50 percent of the total TV panel sales on the mainland,
according to WitsView, a Taiwan-based industrial research institute.</P>
      <P>In terms of single firms, Taiwan's Chimei Innolux Corp. was the the largest TV
panel supplier in China, grabbing a 23 percent share, followed by AUO and South
Korea's Samsung, each of which took 22 percent, the institute said.</P>
      <P>WitsView said China has become the single market that has demonstrated the most
rapid growth in TV panel demand.</P>
      <P>The policy of Taiwan's government to allow local panel makers to set up back-end
module production bases in China has made Taiwanese firms competitive on the
mainland, WitsView said.</P>

(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>In a recent meeting held by an Executive Yuan employment promotion task force,
the Ministry of Finance (MOF) was scheduled to deliver a report on the "earned
income tax credit (EITC) " system, a refundable tax credit designed to both
reduce the burden of payroll taxes and supplement the wages of low-income
workers.</P>
      <P>No discussion, however,  was held on the plan because of differences between the
MOF and the Ministry of the Interior (MOI) . While the MOF thinks the EITC is a
"social welfare" measure and should be the responsibility of the MOI, the MOI
believes it is a "negative income tax" system and should therefore fall under
the MOF's jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>The buck-passing between the two ministries again exposes the hypocrisy and
stupidity of Taiwan's bureaucracy.</P>
      <P>Although "social welfare" and "negative income tax" can be two independent
systems, the characteristic of the EITC is that it is a combination of the two.</P>
      <P>The EITC is not only one of President Ma Ying-jeou's campaign promises but also
a creative reform, but it has now become a "sacrifice," abandoned by both
ministries.</P>
      <P>If the situation is not dealt with properly, it will be subject to scrutiny by
voters and will pose a stiff challenge to Ma's re-election bid in 2012.

      <P>A US$3 billion China investment application filed by flat panel maker AU
Optronics Corp. (AUO) remains undecided, as the application has been excluded
from the agenda of a review meeting of the Investment Commission to be held at
the end of August, government officials said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Officials from the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) said that as the
Investment Commission has not received any comments from an MOEA technology
review committee on AUO's adjustments  in its commitment to invest in Taiwan,
which is a prerequisite of the China project, the upcoming meeting is unlikely
to process the project.</P>
      <P>In March, AUO filed the application to set up a 7.5th-generation thin-film-
transistor liquid crystal display (TFT LCD) plant in Kunshan, in China's Jiangsu
Province after the government relaxed restrictions to allow local flat panel
firms to build up to three 6th-generation or above plants in China.</P>
      <P>However, applicants must give an assurance that they can maintain a technology
lead over China and promise to continue to invest in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>For  the Kunshan  project,  AUO,  which  is operating  an 8.5th-generation plant
in Taiwan, had previously promised to spend NT$400 billion (US$12.52 billion) to
build four 10th-generation plants in the Central Taiwan Science Park.</P>
      <P>However, after reassessing the fast-changing market, AUO later decided  to
adjust its Taiwan  investment  plan to build two 11th-generation flat panel
plants and solar energy related facilities instead of the four 10th-generation
plants.</P>
      <P>AUO was asked by the MOEA technology committee, which is led by Vice Minister of
Economic Affairs Hwang Jung-Chiou, to submit more documents for the plan
adjustments before the China project is forwarded to the Investment Commission,
which is also under the ministry, for a final decision.</P>
      <P>This development defied market expectations that the Investment Commission would
approve the AUO China project by the end of August, since the science park
approved the plan adjustments earlier this month.</P>
      <P>The MOEA officials said the ministry is handling the AUO application "very
carefully."</P>
      <P>The approval from the science park came at a sensitive time, as the Taiwan High
Administrative Court suspended the development of the third and fourth phases of
development of the science park after residents sued the government for failing
to present a reliable environmental impact assessment for the development.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan to explain decision to cut tax on rice wine</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government is working on a presentation of evidence to show that imported
distilled spirits will never be affected by the recent tax cut on rice wine in
Taiwan because the latter is used almost exclusively as a cooking ingredient and
is seldom drunk, Ministry of Economic Affairs officials said Saturday.</P>
      <P>If necessary, the government will send representatives to the United States and
the European Union to explain why it has slashed the tax on locally produced
rice wine, the officials said.</P>
      <P>On Aug. 19, the Legislative Yuan approved a revision to the Tobacco and Alcohol
Tax Act allowing a cut in the tax on rice wine to NT$5.4 (US$0.16) per 0.6-liter
bottle from NT$29.5.</P>
      <P>The move raised U.S. and European concerns over a possible market impact due to
the tax cut and the Office of the United States Trade Representative advised
Taiwan Aug.  19 to respect World Trade Organization (WTO) regulations as a
member of the economic bloc.</P>
      <P>The European Union also said the cut violates the WTO principle of equal
treatment for imported and locally produced goods.</P>
      <P>According to government sources, it is anticipated that U.S. and European
governments will not lodge litigation over the issue at the WTO in the near
future because they have to collect opinions from the justice departments and
liquor traders.</P>
      <P>"So far, they have just expressed concern, " the officials said.</P>
      <P>Rice wine, as a distillate, is taxed like whisky or brandy, but is used almost
only for cooking. The U.S. and European Union are under the impression that
cutting the tax on the kitchen condiment will somehow impact the sale of
imported Scotch and other spirits sold for drinking.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The number of approved inbound investment applications in the first seven months
of this year rose almost 30 percent from a year earlier, the Investment
Commission said Saturday.</P>
      <P>During the seven-month period, the commission under the Ministry of Economic
Affairs (MOEA) approved a total of 1,121 inbound investment applications,
including 367 projects in the retail and wholesale sector, 91 cases in the
electronics field and 88 projects in finance and insurance, it said.</P>
      <P>However, in terms of the value of approved inbound investments during the same
period, the statistics show a double-digit decline from a year earlier.</P>
      <P>The approved inbound investments totaled US$2.47 billion in the past seven
months, down 18.93 percent year-on-year, the commission said.</P>
      <P>Fan Liang-tung, executive secretary of the commission, said the decline reflects
a high comparison base against last year, boosted by a US$480 million investment
from Citibank and a US$250 million investment by Standard Chartered Bank.</P>
      <P>Fan said that although the number of applications increased, a lack of large
single cases dragged down the total investment amount, adding that the MOEA will
make more efforts to encourage foreign investors to bring large investment
projects to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He said the inbound investment projects in the January-July period were mostly
under US$100 million per case.</P>
      <P>However, he went on, based on the increase in the number of inbound investment
applications, foreign investors have still shown faith in the local investment
environment.</P>
      <P>In July alone, the commission approved 172 inbound investment applications
amounting to a combined US$252 million.</P>
      <P>After Taiwan and China signed an economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA)
in June, the government has been gearing up to persuade foreign companies to use
Taiwan as a springboard into China.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the month, the Cabinet set up an "InvesTaiwan Service Center" to
promote the nation as an ideal destination for foreign investors.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, The Council for Economic Planning and Development is scheduled to
hold a series of conventions from Aug. 23 to introduce the local investment
environment, while the MOEA is planning a similar event for Sept. 21.</P>
      <P>In a related development, the commission approved a total of 140 outbound
investment applications in the seven-month period, down 2.78 percent from a year
earlier, but the value of the investments totaled US$1.5 billion, up 7.33
percent year-on-year.</P>

      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih promised Saturday to help the pharmaceutical sector remove
non-tariff barriers that are blocking Taiwan's exports of pharmaceutical raw
materials to China.</P>
      <P>Wu said the government will seek to negotiate the issue with China step by step
so that the products can have a fair opportunity to access the Chinese market.</P>
      <P>In light of the huge development potential of the pharmaceutical biotechnology
industry, the government has included it as one of the "six emerging industries"
that enjoy strong support from the government, according to Wu during a visit to
ScinoPharm Taiwan in Tainan County, the country's leading manufacturer of
pharmaceutical raw materials.</P>
      <P>Ma Hai-yi, the company's president, said Taiwan's output of pharmaceutical raw
materials totaled NT$12.24 billion last year, NT$5.43 billion of which were for
export.</P>
      <P>Of the export volume, more than 50 percent was produced by ScinoPharm, Ma said,
adding that her company's goal is to become one of the top five pharmaceutical
firms in the world.</P>
      <P>According to Ma, ScinoPharm is at present focusing on the development of active
pharmaceutical ingredients for anti-cancer drugs, and the products have
successfully entered high-threshold markets such as the United States, Europe
and Japan after obtaining safety certification in these countries.</P>
      <P>However, Ma said, pharmaceutical raw materials from Taiwan still face many non-
tariff barriers such as legal and trade restrictions imposed by the Chinese
authorities when it comes to accessing the Chinese market. If these barriers are
overcome, it will give a major boost to the output of pharmaceutical raw
materials by Taiwan, she added.</P>

      <P>Taiwan aims to lower its jobless rate to below 5 percent by the end of this year
as the local economy is on a strong rebound from the global financial meltdown,
Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) Chairwoman Wang Ju-hsuan said Saturday.</P>
      <P>At a job fair held by the council in southern Taiwan's Kaohsiung, Wang said that
due to the economic recovery, the job market has improved, with jobs surpassing
demand.</P>
      <P>Wang said the council will try to seize this good opportunity to bring down the
jobless rate to below 5 percent by the end of this year.</P>
      <P>The job fair involved around 50 firms offering more than 4,800 jobs.</P>
      <P>Wang expressed hope that employers will increase salaries to attract talent that
can contribute to industrial development.</P>
      <P>On the same occasion, Lin San-quei, director of the Bureau of Employment and
Vocational Training under the CLA, said that apart from organizing job fairs,
the bureau has set up a website and telephone hotlines to match employers with
job-seekers 24 hours a day.</P>
      <P>In the last two months, the Hsinchu Science Park and the Central Taiwan Science
Park, two of the country's high-tech powerhouses, have held two large job fairs
offering  10,000  and 7,857  jobs, respectively.</P>
      <P>In June, the unemployment rate stood at 5.16 percent, up from 5.14 percent
recorded in May, boosted by first-time jobseekers entering the market following
graduation.</P>
      <P>However,  the job market  has shown signs  of significant improvement  thanks to
the revival of the economy,  with the unemployment rate falling from a peak of
6.14 percent registered in August 2009.</P>
      <P>In the second quarter, the economy rose 12.53 percent from a year earlier,
beating a previous forecast of 7.66 percent on the back of strong export growth
and rising private consumption and investment.</P>
      <P>Taiwan recorded its worst-ever recession, with its gross domestic product
falling 9.06 percent in the first quarter of last year before the local economy
gradually recovered and emerged from the recession in the fourth quarter of last

      <P>A male liger cub -- an illegally bred cross between a male lion and a tigeress
-- died Friday with another listed as being in critical condition, an animal
shelter said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Pei Jai-chyi, director of the National Pingtung University of Science and
Technology's Protected Animal Rescue Center in southern Taiwan, said the two
ligers were in poor condition when they were brought to the center Aug. 16.</P>
      <P>"The two ligers were obviously underweight and had weak immune systems when they
arrived, " said Pei.</P>
      <P>"Ligers  usually suffer from genetic problems  due to the cross-breeding of the
two species, putting the cubs in an endangered situation from the moment they
are born," he said.</P>
      <P>He said the animals have poor chances of survival and are also prone to genetic
problems. He added that the two cubs had been in intensive care since their
arrival, which meant there had been no opportunity to conduct health checks on
them.</P>
      <P>Pei said the male cub was sent for an autopsy after it died and was found to
have accumulated fluid in its lungs, as well as a distended kidney and spleen.</P>
      <P>They were two of three ligers born to a tigeress on a private zoo in southern
Taiwan. One of them died of hypothermia shortly after its birth, while the two
were confiscated and taken to the center for intensive care.</P>
      <P>Huang Kuo-nan, the owner of the zoo, has been accused of violating the Wildlife
Conservation Law and fined NT$50,000 for allowing the animals to breed, a figure
blasted by an animal protection group as "too little to pay for such illegal
behavior."</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs said Saturday that it will hold a forum in
Tokyo Aug. 24 to seek Japanese partners to collaborate with Taiwanese companies
investing in China.</P>
      <P>Working with Japan's Mizuho Bank, the Department of Investment Services under
the MOEA has planned the convention that will be the second of its kind in
Taiwan's ambitions efforts to seek cooperation with Japan for investing in
China, said Ling Chia-yuh, director of the department.</P>
      <P>The first forum was held May 21 in Taipei and prompted about 45 Japanese firms
to express interest in teaming up with Taiwanese companies.</P>
      <P>Ling said Mizuho Bank has found about 10 Japanese firms involved in
semiconductors, content design for cell phones, solar energy and LED businesses,
which are willing to hold talks with Taiwanese companies in the upcoming forum.</P>
      <P>Approximately 450 Japanese firms are expected to participate in the forum, Ling
said.</P>
      <P>Lin Tsang-sheng, chief executive officer of Taiwan's President Group, which has
established close business ties with China, will address the forum.</P>
      <P>The group operates a wide range of businesses, including food manufacturing,
retail, securities and merchandise trading.</P>
      <P>Ling said that since Taiwan and China signed an economic cooperation framework
agreement (ECFA) in late June, granting Taiwan preferential tariff status and
easier market access, Japan has become more willing to form partnerships  with
Taiwan while planning investment in China.</P>
      <P>In particular, with the Japanese yen rising sharply against the U.S. dollar,
many small and medium-sized enterprises in Japan are eager to investigate
investment opportunities overseas to alleviate the currency impact, he said.</P>
      <P>Citing a report by Japan's Nomura Research Institute, Ling said about 68 percent
of the Japanese companies that have invested on their own in China have said
their projects have enjoyed success.</P>
      <P>However, the rate is expected to rise to 78 percent if they work with Taiwanese
partners, according to the report.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma ying-jeou said Saturday that economic development can help bridge
the wealth gap between rich and poor.</P>
      <P>Speaking during a visit to a home for the mentally challenged in Taipei County,
the president said that when the economy is in decline, the wealth gap widens,
but when the economy develops, the improvements are reflected in the job market
and household incomes.</P>
      <P>"There are various ways to address the widening gap. First and foremost is to
develop the economy and increase job opportunities to raise income levels," Ma
said.</P>
      <P>His remarks came in the wake of a recent government survey showing that Taiwan's
household income gap widened in 2009, with the average annual disposable income
of the richest 20 percent of families reaching 6.34 times that of the poorest,
the second-widest gap since 2001, when the average income of the richest was
6.39 times that of the poorest.</P>
      <P>Ma noted that Taiwan's economic growth in the first quarter was adjusted upward
to 13.71 percent from the original estimate of 13.27 percent, and that the
figure was 12.5 percent in the second quarter, both of which are high growth
rates that have rarely been seen in recent years.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, on a separate occasion that same day, Premier Wu Den-yih said that
although the economy has obviously taken a turn for the better, the widening
wealth gap is still a cause for concern.</P>
      <P>Making the comments on the sidelines of a job fair at the Tainan branch of the
Southern Taiwan Science Park in which 47 companies were offering more than 9,000
jobs, Wu said the revenue of the Southern Taiwan Science Park in the first half
of the year grew by 59.1 percent from the same period of last year, while the
number of employees increased by more than 6,000 from the year-earlier level.</P>
      <P>The economy has definitely rebounded, with many firms working overtime, he said.</P>
      <P>But he lamented that the widening wealth shows that many people are still unable
to enjoy the fruits of the economic growth.</P>
      <P>He urged the firms to work harder with the government to address the issue,
saying that "as long as the gap is not bridged, the government cannot feel at
ease. "</P>

      <P>Participants in a forum held in Taipei Saturday highlighted the importance of
technological development for the competitiveness of a global city and previewed
a future trend of the rise of mega cities.</P>
      <P>The future of a modern city has a great deal to do with its technological
readiness and how tech-savvy its residents are, according to experts in various
fields, including a social media website founder, a political candidate in the
year-end Taipei mayoral election and an Internet guru.</P>
      <P>"Of all the cities I have visited, I have seen some that have prospered because
of their advanced technological development and I have seen some that have
faltered, " said Alvin Yoon, founder of Plurk -- one of the most popular social
media websites in Taiwan -- at the forum organized by Business Next magazine.</P>
      <P>Yoon, who travels constantly on business, said that Taipei's Easy Card is one of
the best innovations for a resident in everyday life because it can be used not
only on almost every public transport system but also in libraries and
designated stores, an innovation that had left him with a good impression.</P>
      <P>According to the World Economic Forum (WEF) , Taiwan's Networked Readiness Index
ranked No. 11 in the world and third among Asian countries in 2010.</P>
      <P>The world is also embracing a trend toward the rise of mega cities, said Rebecca
Chang, a former general manager of Google Taiwan. She added that the mayor of a
mega city would be expected to have at least the same -- if not more -- impact
than a head of state in the future.</P>
      <P>The reason for this is simple, she said, because according to estimates, more
than 70 percent of the people on Earth will live in urban areas in the future.</P>
      <P>Chang said she is cautiously optimistic about Taipei's future as a
technologically advanced metropolis, as the city ranked No. 39 in the Global
Cities Index 2010 released the previous week by U.S.-based Foreign Policy
magazine, and because Taiwan has always been one of the most successful
countries in developing  information  and communication technology.</P>
      <P>Su Tseng-chang, the opposition Democratic Progressive Party's candidate in the
Taipei mayoral election in November and an avid user of social media sites such
as Plurk and Facebook, said technology and the Internet have changed the face of
modern politics.</P>
      <P>Citing the example of U.S. President Barack Obama, who is seen as the most
successful political candidate to have run an election campaign on the Internet,
Su said political candidates now are able to communicate with and mobilize
voters, as well as to receive donations online.</P>
      <P>"Modern politics is no longer a top-down process. It is now a bottom-up process
and a two-way dialogue. The government and the cities are no longer run by the
elite but by everyone who is willing to participate in the dialogue, " said Su,
who has more than 55,000 fans on his Facebook fan page.</P>

      <P>While cross-Taiwan Strait commercial exchanges soar as a result of the opening
of tourism and the signing of an economic cooperation pact, government figures
now show that the number of families living under the poverty line in Taiwan has
risen to 108,000, with 260,000 people involved, both record highs.</P>
      <P>The widening gap between rich and poor is definitely not the result of Taiwan's
closer economic engagement with China, but it is true that the new benefits
created by improved cross-strait ties have not trickled down to everybody in
Taiwan, particularly those at the lower end of the economic scale.</P>
      <P>The signing of the cross-strait economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA)
has made Taiwan's economy into a bigger pie. The government should waste no time
in planning on and overseeing how the pie should be sliced impartially so that
all sectors of society can reap the rewards.</P>
      <P>The last thing the government should do is neglect to address the fairness of
the distribution of newly generated wealth in the wake of the landmark trade
pact.</P>
      <P>If the government does indeed fail to act to resolve the problem, the ECFA might
help to increase Taiwan's overall wealth, but it will also further polarize the
country's wealth distribution, and in turn create new social injustice.</P>
      <P>The administration cannot be too careful in this regard.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Talk of the day -- Should civil servants get pay raise next year?</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>08/22/10  13:59:38
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih recently decided against any raise for public-sector wages
next year, but Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin appealed Saturday for a moderate upward
adjustment of salaries for middle- and low-echelon civil servants.</P>
      <P>Now that Taiwan's economy has regained momentum after the recession, the central
government should raise the pay for middle- and low-ranking public-sector
employees to let them share the fruits of economic recovery and simultaneously
stimulate the private sector to follow suit.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, an article carried in the latest issue of the Monthly Bulletin of
Statistics of the Republic of China said economic globalization and an exodus of
local companies to China has led to a steady decline in the ratio of earned
income to Taiwan's gross domestic product (GDP)  and a polarization of domestic
wealth distribution.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from the local media coverage of the developments:</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>Hau said in an interview with this newspaper Saturday that judging from the
current domestic economic situation, a modest pay hike will not fuel inflation.</P>
      <P>He also said his proposal has nothing to do with his bid for a second mayoral
term.</P>
      <P>With Taiwan's GDP posting a higher-than-expected 12.53 percent growth in the
second quarter of this year and the annual growth rate projected to hit a
21-year high of 8.24 percent, next year is indeed the right time to raise
salaries for lower-ranking civil servants, Hau said.</P>
      <P>His initiative reportedly has received support from some ruling Kuomintang
legislators.</P>
      <P>Several lawmakers have said in private that they will pressure the Executive
Yuan to backtrack  on its decision  and raise public-sector wages by at least 1
percent or 2 percent in the coming year.</P>
      <P>Major labor groups said they are not opposed to increasing public-sector wages,
but they said that if the government wants to effectively  stimulate domestic
consumption to sustain economic growth, it should first raise the country's
minimum wage, which has remained stagnant at NT$17,280 (US$540) since 2007.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Finance said the government will have to borrow an additional
NT$7.1 billion if public-sector wages are raised by 1 percent next year.
According to the Executive Yuan's 2010 budget plan, the central government must
borrow at least NT$429 billion to make ends meet. (Aug. 22, 2010).</P>
      <P>Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>The article carried in the August issue of the Directorate General of Budget,
Accounting and Statistics publication said that earned income traditionally
accounts for the largest share of Taiwan's GDP. The ratio of earnings of
employed labor to GDP reached a record high of 51.4 percent in 1990, but the
figure has been declining steadily since 1995 and hit a low of 44.5 percent in
2007.</P>
      <P>The trend could be attributed in part to economic globalization that has seen an
influx of cheap labor from China, India and East European countries into the
world market, with resultingly narrow room for wage hikes, the article said.</P>
      <P>Another reason lies in the relocation of a large number of Taiwanese companies
and their employees to China, the article noted. As a result, the ratio of
earned income to GDP has declined substantially, while those of corporate
earnings and consumption of fixed capital to the GDP have risen steadily. All
these developments have contributed to a continued widening of the domestic
income gap, it concluded. (Aug. 22, 2010).</P>

    <HEADLINE>Unemployment rate expected to rise slightly in July: expert</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's unemployment rate is likely to continue to rise in July, with an
improving economy offset by slowing demand from employers for new college
graduates, an expert said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The unemployment rate was 5.16 percent in June, edging up 0.02 percentage points
from the previous month as this year's batch of graduates entered the job
market. The unemployment figure for July was expected to be released Monday.</P>
      <P>Hsin Ping-lung,  an associate professor at National Taiwan University's Graduate
Institute of National Development, said that although the unemployment rate was
expected to continue to rise in July, the rise would be very small, thanks to
the improving economy.</P>
      <P>Hsin added, however, that the unemployment situation for new college graduates
has deteriorated further.</P>
      <P>"That does not relate to the economy itself, it is more a structural problem
related to excess supply, " Hsin said, pointing out that "there were just too
many college graduates."</P>
      <P>Under a trend of flat organizations, the demand for college graduates has been
less than before, while a lot of entry-level jobs have also been superceded by
computers, Hsin said.</P>
      <P>"College graduates face fewer job opportunities and supply exceeds demand," he
said.</P>
      <P>If Taiwan ignores the problem and continues to produce a large number of college
graduates, even a booming economy will not slow the worsening of unemployment
among new college graduates, Hsin said.</P>
      <P>He suggested that the government should concentrate more on higher technological
and vocational education to fix the structural problem.</P>
      <P>The local industry structure still requires a lot of low- and middle- class
technical workers, he said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's  high unemployment  is a pressing  issue for the government, with its
unemployment rate in the second quarter of this year -- 5.2 percent -- the
highest among Asia's "Four Little Dragons."</P>
      <P>Taiwan's economy in the second quarter grew 12.53 percent from a year earlier,
with exports growing the fastest among its Asian peers at 46.2 percent.</P>
      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih has vowed to step down if his administration fails to bring
the unemployment rate below 5 percent by the end of this year.</P>

      <P>A November election in Haiti is hoped to produce a president who can steer the
Caribbean country through its post-quake efforts, but the process of electing a
leader could be compounding the already snail-pace and problem-ridden
reconstruction effort, according to a Haitian official.</P>
      <P>Mario Chouloute, minister conseiller charge d'affaires to Taipei, said in an
interview with CNA Friday that the country is embroiled in adouble whammy
situation -- trying to rebuild the nation from scratch while organizing a major
election at the same time.</P>
      <P>The Jan.  12 7.3-magnitude earthquake left the capital of Port-au-Prince and
nearby cities with colossal destruction. At least 15 percent of the population
was directly affected and 300,000 people lost their lives.  Many government
buildings,  including  the Presidential Palace, were reduced to rubble.</P>
      <P>Chouloute said nearly 5 million eligible voters lost their personal documents in
the quake and the government is faced with the task of quickly devising a system
to ascertain voter identification and issue them with new ID cards, all within
two months.</P>
      <P>"Its two difficult situations at the same time. [The election] complicates the
situation in Haiti. Many institutions, many houses collapsed and many many
people lost their identification  and everything. So now the Electoral Council
has to provide an electoral identification card to each Haitian citizen who can
vote," he said.</P>
      <P>The organization of the election will undoubtedly take a toll on the
reconstruction effort, he added, reiterating that it is "two very difficult
situations to be handled at the same time."</P>
      <P>The Haitian diaspora in North American alone accounts for 2 million people, but
Haiti does not have the technology or the legislation to permit overseas voting.</P>
      <P>The Haiti Provisional Electoral Council released that day a list of 19
candidates qualified to vie for the presidency -- which does not include
musician, record producer and politician Wyclef Jean, a Haiti-born U.S.-raised
performer who said he was rejected because he did not have residency in the
country.</P>
      <P>One of the criteria to run for president in Haiti is proof of five-year's
consecutive residency in Haiti.</P>
      <P>Jean said he is not ready to throw in the towel in his bid, but did not confirm
that he will appeal.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Quoting a citation of Taiwanese democracy trailblazer Chiang Wei-shui, President
Ma Ying-jeou called Sunday for politicians across partisan lines to demonstrate
esprit de corps for the cause of the nation.</P>
      <P>Paraphrasing a renowned couplet by Chiang that reads "The compatriots must come
together in unity. Unity is truly invincible, " Ma said in his weekly video
program that partisan rancor has not only taken a toll on the nation's
resources, it has also held up the country's growth and development.</P>
      <P>"These are points of contention that have disillusioned the people," the
president said.</P>
      <P>He called for everyone in Taiwan not to forget the bitter lessons that the
country has learned from political strife over the past years.</P>
      <P>"We should exercise greater tolerance and magnanimity toward each other so that
we can unite and strive in concert to create a brighter future for Taiwan," he
continued.</P>
      <P>He also saluted Chiang as not only a political pioneer but also a social
reformer with global perspective.</P>
      <P>He repeated Chiang's saying that "Taiwan's career is to serve as a guard on the
frontline of world peace." To achieve that goal, Taiwan must change culturally
from the roots, Chiang said.</P>
      <P>Chiang (1891-1931) led the way for the first political movement and the first
cultural enlightenment movement in Taiwan during the period of Japanese colonial
rule. While he practiced medicine at the hospital he founded in Taipei, he
diagnosed Taiwan itself and concluded that the people of Taiwan were afflicted
with "knowledge malnutrition, " so he began to devote himself to the nationalist
movement.</P>
      <P>Founder of the Taiwan Cultural Association and the Taiwan People's Party, Chiang
was one of the first people who tried to lift the status of the Taiwanese during
Japanese rule through the formation of democratic political movements.</P>
      <P>He died of typhoid at the age of 40, or 41 by traditional Chinese reckoning. He
has been described as "Taiwan's Sun Yat-sen" by former Democratic Progressive
Party Legislator and incumbent Control Yuan member Huang Huang-hsiung.</P>
      <P>Huang, Chiang Chao-keng -- a grandson of Chiang -- and Wang Hsiao-po, a National
Taiwan University academic, were also invited to appear and talk on the
president's video presentation.</P>

      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih expressed concern Sunday over the fate of three ranking
executives of TFT-LCD giant AU Optronics (AUO) who have been barred by a U.S.
district court from leaving the United States while an anti-trust probe
continues.</P>
      <P>Wu pointed out that he is not in any position to try to intervene or interfere
in a judicial procedure in the United States, but said he has instructed
Taiwanese officials posted in San Francisco to gain a better understanding of
the surprise incident and to render assistance if possible.</P>
      <P>The three executives -- Lai-juh Chen, Hsuan Bin Chen and Hui Hsiung -- have been
ordered by the court to surrender their passports and to not travel outside the
northern district of California without court permission.</P>
      <P>They traveled to the United States two or three weeks ago in a bid to explain
themselves in court and clear the AUO Group of charges after a federal grand
jury in San Francisco charged AUO, its Houston-based U.S. subsidiary, and six

    <HEADLINE>Schumann's music meets traditional Chinese Nanguan</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>08/22/10  17:06:15</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>When a pianist playing Schumann's classical music shares a stage with a musician
playing traditional Chinese Nanguan songs, what kind of new excitement will be
generated?</P>
      <P>This is an idea that Taiwanese stage director Wei Ying-chuan felt interested in,
so she accepted the challenge of directing an upcoming concert featuring the two
very different musical approaches.</P>
      <P>"The concept originated with conductor Chien Wen-Pin, who is now working in
Germany but will return to Taiwan to be the music director and play the piano at
the concert, which will be an event rarely seen in recent years," Wei told CNA.</P>
      <P>The concert, titled "Timeless Love -- Concert of Dichterliebe &amp; Nanguan,"
will feature Chien on piano, as well as German tenor Tilman Lichdi and
traditional Nanguan artist Wang Xin-xin, performing together for the first time.</P>
      <P>Nanguan is a type of Chinese classical music that originated hundreds of years
ago in the southern Chinese province of Fujian. It has a totally different
performance style compared to the Western classical style and finding ways to
combine the two harmoniously has become an interesting experiment for Chien.</P>
      <P>When he began to organize a concert to commemorate German composer Robert
Schumann's 200th birthday, he recalled the first time he heard Nanguan music,
played by Wang. "When she started to play, it was like being transported to
another time and place, " he said.</P>
      <P>Chien,  the resident conductor of Deutsche Oper am Rhien, therefore invited Wang
and Lichdi to share the stage to present an unprecedented  crossover  of musical
genres featuring  Nanguan performances plus Schumann's famous "Dichterliebe"
(The Poet's Love), which are based on 16 works of the 19th century romantic poet
Heinrich Heine.</P>
      <P>Compared to staging a traditional performance, this is obviously a new challenge
for Wang.</P>
      <P>"I was not familiar with Schumann's music at the beginning, but I discovered a
similarity of tone with some of the Nanguan songs, " she said, adding that she
composited different pieces from several Nanguan works that harmonized well with
the Western pieces.</P>
      <P>In this  new experiment,  Chien  arranged  the traditional performance in a
different way. "Schumann's songs will be the main focus, and Nanguan will be
another story sung and told by Wang, " Chien noted, adding that sometimes two
singers will convey a sense of love by singing together, while on other
occasions the piano music will cut in as the third member of a love triangle.</P>
      <P>To the music director, "it's not only a crossover of genres, but actually a
brand new creation," Chien said.</P>
      <P>Chien has previously cooperated with the Taipei Chinese Orchestra and the Cloud
Gate Dance Theatre, and has also led the National Symphony Orchestra in
performances that have shared the stage with many theatrical groups. Those
experiences have enabled him to create more interesting multi-faceted concerts.</P>
      <P>This time he has invited Wei to be his partner to provide more variety in the
new work.</P>
      <P>"I expect to create a concert where audiences not only can listen to beautiful
music, but also can see it, " Wei said, adding that she has designed a stage
with a piano and modern Italian furniture on one side, while on the other side
is Wang, wearing old-style clothes and playing a traditional musical instrument,
in order to provide a contrasting image.</P>
      <P>"As the director of the show, I will create an atmosphere reminiscent of a piano
bar in old Shanghai," Wei said.</P>
      <P>"I will utilize an abstract method to express the concept of a love triangle
throughout the concert, " she went on, adding that the show mainly consists of
the concert itself, without too many dramatic elements.</P>
      <P>After one rehearsal together, Wei described the musical portion as quite
outstanding. "My part is to let audiences `see' a truly beautiful love story
through the staging," she said.</P>
      <P>The concert will be held at the Guangfu Auditorium of Taipei's Zhongshan Hall
Sept. 3-5 as part of the Taipei Arts Festival. By Sunnie Chen CNA staff

    <HEADLINE>Cheaper cost for exchanging yuan expected by end August</HEADLINE>

      <P>The state-owned Bank of Taiwan (BOT) said Sunday that the cost of exchanging
Chinese yuan is expected to be cheaper from the end of August after authorized
Taiwanese banks begin buying yuan directly from the Hong Kong arm of Bank of
China.</P>
      <P>BOT Vice President Yang Feng-yen said that after the BOT and the Hong Kong arm
of Bank of China signed a cash settlement agreement July 26, the BOT was allowed
to buy yuan cash with U.S. dollars. However, some issues remained to be settled,
he noted.</P>
      <P>Yang explained that settlement of yuan and New Taiwan dollar notes involves
cross-border transport and security issues, and that the timing of the
settlement is also very important.</P>
      <P>"Those issues are expected to be settled by the end of August, " said Yang.</P>
      <P>The BOT and the state-controlled Mega Bank -- Taiwan's top two foreign exchange
banks -- were approved by the Central Bank of the Republic of China in July to
engage in the yuan cash settlement services. Both banks have signed the new
settlement agreements with the Chinese side.</P>
      <P>Yang said the BOT is also in the process of signing contracts with Taiwan's
financial institutions to provide them with yuan notes.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese banks currently buy yuan in Hong Kong from HSBC and Bank of America.
However, the supply of notes -- most of which are old -- from those two banks
has not been very stable and the cost of procuring them is relatively high.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's central bank has estimated that the new cash settlement agreements
could lead to savings of about NT$1,000 on every procurement of 20,000 Chinese
yuan.</P>
      <P>Yang said that after the new services are launched, Taiwan will be able to get a
more stable supply of newer yuan notes, as well as cheaper exchange costs.</P>

      <P>A proposed date for the passing of National Health Insurance (NHI) amendments
should be settled as soon as possible,  Department of Health (DOH)  Minister
Minister Yaung Chih-liang said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Yaung urged the lawmakers to continue reviewing the reform bill for a second-
generation NHI program in a special legislative session scheduled for next week
and to work out a plausible time schedule for the bill's passage.</P>
      <P>He said the bill has already undergone several reviews by the Legislative
Yuan's  Social Welfare  and Environmental  Hygiene Committee, and that the DOH
has held numerous public hearings on the issue. With the exception of 26 clauses
in the bill that require further discussion, most have now been addressed, he
said.</P>
      <P>The legislature needs to give an indication of when the bill will be passed
because the implementation of the second-generation NHI system is complicated
and the relevant authorities must plan ahead, said Yaung.</P>
      <P>In a move aimed at resolving a dispute over the bill between the rival parties,
Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng was scheduled to convene a negotiation
meeting the following day between the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) and the opposition
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>Although the KMT hopes to clear the bill by the end of the special session, the
DPP could still throw a wrench into the works by calling into question the
content of each individual article, said Lin Yi-shih, director-general of the
KMT's Policy Committee.</P>
      <P>Lin said the KMT will try to come to terms with the DPP in the negotiation
meeting and will also seek support from KMT legislators who disagree with
passing the bill in the ongoing special session.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, the DPP has said the legislature should not hurry the bill
through without full discussion and should hold off on the review until the next
regular legislative session.</P>
      <P>It will not be possible to pass the bill during the current special session,
said DPP caucus whip Ker Chien-ming.</P>
      <P>According  to  an  anonymous  legislative  source,  five representatives  from
the KMT,  the Legislative  Yuan and the Presidential Office had previously
agreed that the purpose of the two-week special legislative session was to deal
with four priority issues -- the economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA)
, the admission of Chinese students to Taiwanese universities and colleges,
amendments to the election and recall law, and the NHI reforms.</P>
      <P>As the three other items have all been dealt with, the KMT is determined to push
NHI reform bill through by the end of August.</P>

      <P>The daughter of ruling Kuomintang (KMT) Kaohsiung mayoral candidate Huang Chao-
shun, a gynecologist and obstetrician, said Sunday that she will never enter
politics, describing herself as having been a victim of politics since
childhood.</P>
      <P>Chen Ching-huei, nevertheless, vowed to be a solid campaigner for her mother,
who has been nominated as the ruling party's candidate in the Kaohsiung
municipality mayoral race slated for Nov. 27.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a press conference to launch a campaign publicity video of Huang's
titled "The Iron Carnation, " Chen said she was invited by KMT Secretary-General
King Pu-tsung to talk in the film about her relationship with her mother.</P>
      <P>"It was at that point that I came to the realization that mother had been a
stranger to me, since I had seldom met her since childhood, " Chen said.</P>
      <P>Chen said she was brought up in Taipei City by her grandmother and grandfather.
Her grandfather was Huang Tsun-chiu, a former president of the Control Yuan who
passed away in 2000.</P>
      <P>"I remember once I asked my granddad to take me to mother's office after I saw a
giant billboard in Taipei depicting a woman candidate campaigning, who I thought
was my mother," Chen recalled.</P>
      <P>"I cried when I was told by granddad that the woman was not my mother because
she was running in Kaohsiung," Chen continued.</P>
      <P>Chen said it was only after she had grown up that she realized how hard it was
for her mother to be a politician, spending so much time away from home and
never enjoying the happiness of family life.</P>
      <P>"Mother has given the prime of her life over the past 30 years to politics," the
ob-gyn doctor said.</P>
      <P>Huang will run against the opposition Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP's)
official nominee, Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu, and former DPP heavyweight Yang
Chiu-hsing in a three-way race. Yang quit the DPP recently to run as an
independent.</P>
      <P>Initial polls show Huang and Yang trailing Chen by a wide margin in the three-
way race.</P>
      <P>Chen said she has filed for a temporary leave of absence from her work in the
months of the run-up to the election so that she can serve as a doctor on
Huang's campaign team.</P>
      <P>"I will be back into my doctor's white coat as soon as the election is over,"
she added.</P>

      <P>The governor of China's Guangdong Province concluded a week-long visit to Taiwan
Sunday during which his delegation placed orders for local industrial and farm
products worth more than US$7 billion.</P>
      <P>"It has been a wonderful trip, as we had an excellent experience and reaped an
abundant harvest during our stay, " said Huang Huahua at a press conference
prior to his departure.</P>
      <P>Huang, who arrived in Taiwan at the head of a 1,000-man delegation from his
province Aug. 16, said they were met with hospitality from the Taiwanese people
and witnessed for themselves the vitality of Taiwan's economy. As a result, "not
only was deeper mutual understanding further solidified, but expanded
cooperation in various fields between Guangdong and Taiwan was also achieved, "
he added.</P>
      <P>Huang said that during the past week, the members of his delegation, mostly
representatives of Guangdong enterprises, signed agreements with their Taiwanese
counterparts to buy a total of US$7.085 billion-worth of products -- 80 percent
of which are manufactured by local small- and medium-sized enterprises. The
figure also includes US$1.4 billion-worth  of farm produce and US$10 million-
worth of investment in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In addition, they signed 115 agreements or memorandums of understanding with
their Taiwanese counterparts for cooperation in the areas of tourism, culture,
education and medical care.</P>
      <P>The delegation also gave away 10,000 tickets for the Asian Games to be held Nov.
22-27 in the Guangdong city of Guangzhou, and 1,000 tickets for the Asian Para
Games to be held Dec. 12-19 there, in addition to donating 15 million Chinese
yuan (NT$60 million) as relief funds for victims of natural disasters in the
Kaohsiung area.</P>
      <P>Huang said he also brought to Taiwan around 9,000 tourists, and that the total
number of Guangdong tourist arrivals in Taiwan will break 180,000 by the end of
this year.</P>
      <P>The delegation came on the heels of visits by provincial-level groups from

    <HEADLINE>Public-sector wage hike should wait for stronger GDP growth: Premier</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Now is not the time for the government to raise public-sector wages because
uncertainties still lurk in the global and domestic economic recovery in the
second half of the year, Premier Wu Den-yih said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Wu was responding to an appeal by Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin for a central
government raise in pay for middle- and low-echelon civil servants, military
personnel and teachers in public schools in 2011 to let them  have a taste  of
the fruits  of the country's faster-than-expected economic growth in the first
half of this year.</P>
      <P>According to Hau, a moderate pay hike for grassroots public servants would boost
their morale and stimulate the business sector to follow suit so that more
people would be able to enjoy the fruits of the country's economic growth.</P>
      <P>Wu said, however, that although Taiwan scored remarkable GDP growth rates in the
first and second quarters of the year, the gains are still not enough to make up
for the tax revenue shortfall resulting from last year's economic slump.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, he went on, the economic outlook for the second half remains
uncertain as the economic recovery in Europe, the United States, Japan and China
seems to be slowing down.</P>
      <P>Another dissuading factor for Hau's proposed pay hike at present lies in the
fact that the government is still reliant on borrowing to make ends meet.</P>
      <P>"An upward public-sector wage adjustment at the moment could leave an impression
that the government is borrowing money simply to benefit civil servants," Wu
said, adding that a pay raise might also fuel inflation of the domestic consumer
price index.</P>
      <P>Acknowledging that public-sector wages have not been adjusted for several years,
Wu said he personally supports a pay hike for grassroots civil servants.</P>
      <P>"But weighing our overall national situation, I feel compelled to decide against
such a move, " Wu said, adding that if the domestic economic recovery continues
to gather steam and the government's tax revenues continue to rise
substantially, the Executive Yuan will raise public-sector  wages at an
appropriate  time by seeking legislative approval for a budget increase.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, Hau and three ruling Kuomintang legislators from Taipei City
-- Chiang Nai-shin, Pan Wei-kang and Alex Fai -- hosted a news conference to
drum up support for the pay raise proposal.</P>
      <P>"With our GDP growth rate expected to hit a 21-year high this year, I believe
the government can afford a modest salary hike for grassroots public servants,"
Hau said.</P>
      <P>He also rebutted allegations that his proposal amounts to election bribery,
arguing that the speculation is unfounded because the pay raise, if adopted,
would not be implemented until next year, while the election will take place
Nov. 27.</P>
      <P>Fai threw his support behind Hau's appeal, saying that a 1 percent pay raise
would only increase the government expenditure by an estimated NT$7 billion
(US$218.75 million), or 0.45 percent of the government's total 2010 budget of
NT$1.6 trillion.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of veterans who survived a protracted communist Chinese artillery
bombardment of the outlying island of Kinmen more than 50 years ago traveled to
the island Sunday to pay tribute to their fallen comrades.</P>
      <P>A total of 77 veterans, accompanied by Lu Fang-yen, chairman of the 823
Artillery Bombardment Veterans and Friends Association, flew to Kinmen to attend
a commemoration ceremony in honor of the soldiers who gave their lives to
safeguard Kinmen against a Chinese invasion in 1958.</P>
      <P>"I came to mourn my brothers in arms so that they won't be lonely," said Lu,
himself a veteran who served in the military police during the bombardment.</P>
      <P>"Although our military success secured peace in the Taiwan Strait for 50 years,
the battle brought tragedy to many people on both sides of the strait," Lu said.</P>
      <P>On behalf of all the veterans, Lu urged the government to include information
about the bombardment in school textbooks to teach children the heavy price of
war and to promote peace between China and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>On Aug. 23, 1958, Chinese forces launched a bombardment of Kinmen that was
intended to soften the Nationalist forces prior to a communist invasion. Over
the next 44 days, as many as 470,000 shells were fired at the 150 square
kilometer island. The troops, however, stood firm against the devastating
onslaught and the invasion attempt was an utter failure.</P>
      <P>The victory for the Nationalist force helped lay the foundation for Taiwan's
subsequent democratic and economic development, and the struggle later came to
be referred  to as the 823 Artillery Bombardment.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council for Cultural Affairs (CCA) said Sunday that it has budgeted
approximately NT$2 billion (US$62.7 million) for celebrating the country's
centenary next year and dismissed media reports that it will spend about NT$3.2
billion on related events.</P>
      <P>The CCA said the NT$3.2 billion figure reported by the media includes various
unrelated costs including NT$480 million for holding the 2011 International
Design Alliance Congress, as well as the costs for other activities such as an
exhibition on the Kangxi Emperor and King Louis XIV at the National Palace
Museum.</P>
      <P>It said that those activities, which have been planned by various departments,
just happen to take place in 2011 and therefore are being promoted together with
the centenary celebrations.</P>
      <P>"Those activities have not been designed as part of the centenary celebrations,
and therefore it is not appropriate to directly combine those costs and consider
them part of the cost of celebrating the centenary," the CCA said in a
statement.</P>
      <P>The council said the planned budget of NT$2 billion will be allocated to
activities planned by the CCA and the Republic of China (Taiwan) Centenary
Foundation, activities held by 25 city and county governments, selected private
celebration events, and broadcasting of the activities.</P>
      <P>It also noted that the planned cost accounts for only 0.11 percent of the
central government's 2011 budget of NT$1.7 trillion.</P>
      <P>"For a family with an annual income of NT$1 million, it should be acceptable to
spend NT$1,000 to celebrate the family's or a family member's 100th birthday, "
the statement said.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Aug. 20 that the cost of celebrating the centenary
is not high and represents 16.6 percent of the cost of holding the 2009 World
Games in Kaohsiung, or 50 percent of the cost of the Deaflympics in Taipei that
same year.</P>

      <P>Several noted local night markets have emerged as new tourist attractions
because of the dazzling array of foodstuffs  and merchandise  they sell that
vividly reflect ordinary Taiwanese people's everyday lives and leisure culture.</P>
      <P>Not only are more and more foreign tourists regarding famous local night markets
as must-visit locations, even high-profile international travel channels have
run special reports to introduce them.</P>
      <P>Riding on this new craze, the Tourism Bureau recently sponsored an online vote
to select the most special and fascinating night markets in Taiwan, which
generated an enthusiastic response from Internet users.</P>
      <P>The charm and allure of Taiwan's night markets lie in their impromptu, casual,
easy-going, flexible and playful atmosphere. They are often also characterized
as overcrowded, noisy, chaotic and boisterous.  These features,  plus rich
variety of local food delicacies on offer, make them very attractive to foreign
visitors.</P>
      <P>However,  greater  efforts should be made to ensure their cleanliness and
sanitation if they are to be made into tourist attractions on a par of world
standards and to ensure their lasting appeal.</P>
      <P>Traffic conditions and signage should also be improved to enhance their
accessibility. (Editorial abstract -- Aug. 22, 2010).</P>

      <P>The governor of China's Guangdong Province concluded a week-long visit to Taiwan
Sunday during which his delegation placed orders for local industrial and farm
products worth more than US$7 billion.</P>
      <P>"It has been a wonderful trip, as we had an excellent experience and reaped an
abundant harvest during our stay, " said Huang Huahua at a press conference
prior to his departure.</P>
      <P>Huang, who arrived in Taiwan at the head of a 1,000-man delegation from his
province Aug. 16, said they were met with hospitality from the Taiwanese people
and witnessed for themselves the vitality of Taiwan's economy. As a result, "not
only was deeper mutual understanding further solidified, but expanded
cooperation in various fields between Guangdong and Taiwan was also achieved, "
he added.</P>
      <P>Huang said that during the past week, the members of his delegation, mostly
representatives of Guangdong enterprises, signed agreements with their Taiwanese
counterparts to buy a total of US$7.085 billion-worth of products -- 80 percent
of which are manufactured by local small- and medium-sized enterprises. The
figure also includes US$1.4 billion-worth  of farm produce and US$10 million-
worth of investment in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In addition, they signed 115 agreements or memorandums of understanding with
their Taiwanese counterparts for cooperation in the areas of tourism, culture,
education and medical care.</P>
      <P>The delegation also gave away 10,000 tickets for the Asian Games to be held Nov.
22-27 in the Guangdong city of Guangzhou, and 1,000 tickets for the Asian Para
Games to be held Dec. 12-19 there, in addition to donating 15 million Chinese
yuan (NT$60 million) as relief funds for victims of natural disasters in the
Kaohsiung area.</P>
      <P>Huang said he also brought to Taiwan around 9,000 tourists, and that the total
number of Guangdong tourist arrivals in Taiwan will break 180,000 by the end of
this year.</P>
      <P>The delegation came on the heels of visits by provincial-level groups from
China's Sichuan, Shaanxi, Jiangsu, Zejiang, Jilin, Guangxi and Hubei provinces,
as well as Shanghai that have arrived in Taiwan since the beginning of this

    <HEADLINE>Public-sector wage hike should wait for stronger GDP growth: Premier</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 22 (CNA)
08/22/10  19:19:48
(By Cheng chi-feng and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Now is not the time for the government to raise public-sector wages because
uncertainties still lurk in the global and domestic economic recovery in the
second half of the year, Premier Wu Den-yih said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Wu was responding to an appeal by Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin for a central
government raise in pay for middle- and low-echelon civil servants, military
personnel and teachers in public schools in 2011 to let them  have a taste  of
the fruits  of the country's faster-than-expected economic growth in the first
half of this year.</P>
      <P>According to Hau, a moderate pay hike for grassroots public servants would boost
their morale and stimulate the business sector to follow suit so that more
people would be able to enjoy the fruits of the country's economic growth.</P>
      <P>Wu said, however, that although Taiwan scored remarkable GDP growth rates in the
first and second quarters of the year, the gains are still not enough to make up
for the tax revenue shortfall resulting from last year's economic slump.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, he went on, the economic outlook for the second half remains
uncertain as the economic recovery in Europe, the United States, Japan and China
seems to be slowing down.</P>
      <P>Another dissuading factor for Hau's proposed pay hike at present lies in the
fact that the government is still reliant on borrowing to make ends meet.</P>
      <P>"An upward public-sector wage adjustment at the moment could leave an impression
that the government is borrowing money simply to benefit civil servants," Wu
said, adding that a pay raise might also fuel inflation of the domestic consumer
price index.</P>
      <P>Acknowledging that public-sector wages have not been adjusted for several years,
Wu said he personally supports a pay hike for grassroots civil servants.</P>
      <P>"But weighing our overall national situation, I feel compelled to decide against
such a move, " Wu said, adding that if the domestic economic recovery continues
to gather steam and the government's tax revenues continue to rise
substantially, the Executive Yuan will raise public-sector  wages at an
appropriate  time by seeking legislative approval for a budget increase.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, Hau and three ruling Kuomintang legislators from Taipei City
-- Chiang Nai-shin, Pan Wei-kang and Alex Fai -- hosted a news conference to
drum up support for the pay raise proposal.</P>
      <P>"With our GDP growth rate expected to hit a 21-year high this year, I believe
the government can afford a modest salary hike for grassroots public servants,"
Hau said.</P>
      <P>He also rebutted allegations that his proposal amounts to election bribery,
arguing that the speculation is unfounded because the pay raise, if adopted,
would not be implemented until next year, while the election will take place
Nov. 27.</P>
      <P>Fai threw his support behind Hau's appeal, saying that a 1 percent pay raise
would only increase the government expenditure by an estimated NT$7 billion
(US$218.75 million), or 0.45 percent of the government's total 2010 budget of
NT$1.6 trillion.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of veterans who survived a protracted communist Chinese artillery
bombardment of the outlying island of Kinmen more than 50 years ago traveled to
the island Sunday to pay tribute to their fallen comrades.</P>
      <P>A total of 77 veterans, accompanied by Lu Fang-yen, chairman of the 823
Artillery Bombardment Veterans and Friends Association, flew to Kinmen to attend
a commemoration ceremony in honor of the soldiers who gave their lives to
safeguard Kinmen against a Chinese invasion in 1958.</P>
      <P>"I came to mourn my brothers in arms so that they won't be lonely," said Lu,
himself a veteran who served in the military police during the bombardment.</P>
      <P>"Although our military success secured peace in the Taiwan Strait for 50 years,
the battle brought tragedy to many people on both sides of the strait," Lu said.</P>
      <P>On behalf of all the veterans, Lu urged the government to include information
about the bombardment in school textbooks to teach children the heavy price of
war and to promote peace between China and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>On Aug. 23, 1958, Chinese forces launched a bombardment of Kinmen that was
intended to soften the Nationalist forces prior to a communist invasion. Over
the next 44 days, as many as 470,000 shells were fired at the 150 square
kilometer island. The troops, however, stood firm against the devastating
onslaught and the invasion attempt was an utter failure.</P>
      <P>The victory for the Nationalist force helped lay the foundation for Taiwan's
subsequent democratic and economic development, and the struggle later came to
be referred  to as the 823 Artillery Bombardment.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council for Cultural Affairs (CCA) said Sunday that it has budgeted
approximately NT$2 billion (US$62.7 million) for celebrating the country's
centenary next year and dismissed media reports that it will spend about NT$3.2
billion on related events.</P>
      <P>The CCA said the NT$3.2 billion figure reported by the media includes various
unrelated costs including NT$480 million for holding the 2011 International
Design Alliance Congress, as well as the costs for other activities such as an
exhibition on the Kangxi Emperor and King Louis XIV at the National Palace
Museum.</P>
      <P>It said that those activities, which have been planned by various departments,
just happen to take place in 2011 and therefore are being promoted together with
the centenary celebrations.</P>
      <P>"Those activities have not been designed as part of the centenary celebrations,
and therefore it is not appropriate to directly combine those costs and consider
them part of the cost of celebrating the centenary," the CCA said in a
statement.</P>
      <P>The council said the planned budget of NT$2 billion will be allocated to
activities planned by the CCA and the Republic of China (Taiwan) Centenary
Foundation, activities held by 25 city and county governments, selected private
celebration events, and broadcasting of the activities.</P>
      <P>It also noted that the planned cost accounts for only 0.11 percent of the
central government's 2011 budget of NT$1.7 trillion.</P>
      <P>"For a family with an annual income of NT$1 million, it should be acceptable to
spend NT$1,000 to celebrate the family's or a family member's 100th birthday, "
the statement said.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Aug. 20 that the cost of celebrating the centenary
is not high and represents 16.6 percent of the cost of holding the 2009 World
Games in Kaohsiung, or 50 percent of the cost of the Deaflympics in Taipei that
same year.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Several noted local night markets have emerged as new tourist attractions
because of the dazzling array of foodstuffs  and merchandise  they sell that
vividly reflect ordinary Taiwanese people's everyday lives and leisure culture.</P>
      <P>Not only are more and more foreign tourists regarding famous local night markets
as must-visit locations, even high-profile international travel channels have
run special reports to introduce them.</P>
      <P>Riding on this new craze, the Tourism Bureau recently sponsored an online vote
to select the most special and fascinating night markets in Taiwan, which
generated an enthusiastic response from Internet users.</P>
      <P>The charm and allure of Taiwan's night markets lie in their impromptu, casual,
easy-going, flexible and playful atmosphere. They are often also characterized
as overcrowded, noisy, chaotic and boisterous.  These features,  plus rich
variety of local food delicacies on offer, make them very attractive to foreign
visitors.</P>
      <P>However,  greater  efforts should be made to ensure their cleanliness and
sanitation if they are to be made into tourist attractions on a par of world
standards and to ensure their lasting appeal.</P>
      <P>Traffic conditions and signage should also be improved to enhance their
accessibility. (Editorial abstract -- Aug. 22, 2010).</P>

      <P>The increasing number of U.S. war games in the Asia-Pacific region and
Washington's moves to further buttress ties with its military allies over the
past several months have caused China concern.</P>
      <P>The U.S. wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are basically over, leaving a legacy of
enormous costs for discharge pay and medical care of the injured. This has
prompting international political observers to suggest that America cannot
afford a third war any time soon.</P>
      <P>An agitated U.S is therefore turning its eyes toward the Asian Pacific.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, China's economic strength has translated into military might. Its
growing influence has caused worry and fear among Southeast Asian countries, and
they hope the U.S. will remain as a counterbalancing force in the region.</P>
      <P>It is worth close observation to see how the situation involving these two
powers will unfold and whether the long existing stability of the Asia-Pacific
region will be threatened.</P>
      <P>Taiwan, which has remained a close ally of the United States despite an absence
of diplomatic relations and has improved its ties with China since President Ma
Ying-jeou took office, is now torn between the two powers. With the situation in
the Asia-Pacific changing swiftly, Taiwan's position will become even more
delicate, and challenging, than ever. (Editorial abstract -- Aug. 23, 2010)</P>

      <P>ARATS Vice President Zheng Lizhong, who arrived in Kaohsiung Saturday in his
capacity as a deputy director of the Taiwan Affairs Office of the Communist

later Monday.</P>
      <P>On his first stop, Zheng, accompanied by ruling Kuomintang Legislator Chung
Shao-ho, met with Taiwanese farmers in Kaohsiung County Sunday.</P>
      <P>According to Chung, Zheng wants to get first-hand information about the export
of Taiwan-grown fruits and other farm produce to China and learn about the
problems that local farmers and traders encounter in their cross-strait business
operations.</P>

the time being although three of its executives were barred by a U.S. judge from
leaving the United States during an anti-trust probe.</P>
      <P>AUO, the world's fourth largest manufacturer of liquid crystal display (LCD)
panels, also said its corporate operations will not be affected by the ongoing
U.S. price-fixing lawsuit against the company.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from the local media coverage of the news:</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>AUO called an emergency meeting Sunday to discuss response strategies to the
situation and its chairman Lee Kun-yao offered crisis management suggestions at
the meeting, a company official said.</P>
      <P>According to the official, the three AUO executives have not been detained and
can stay informed about the company's operations through daily videoconferences.</P>
      <P>Company sources said AUO will ask the U.S. court to lift the overseas travel ban
on its three executives -- Lai-juh Chen, Hsuan Bin Chen and Hui Hsiung -- and
that the company will post bail or other guarantee.</P>
      <P>If the U.S. court rejects the request, the AUO executives will have to remain in
California until the trial formally begins, which could take from a month to a
year.</P>
      <P>The U.S. Justice Department has accused AUO executives of participating in
regular meetings with other industry stakeholders, in Taipei hotel rooms and
restaurants, to discuss and fix LCD prices from 2001 to 2006.</P>
      <P>In the subsequent probe, six companies pleaded guilty in the subsequent probe,
including Taiwan's Chi Mei and Chunghwa Picture Tubes, South Korea's LG display
and Japan's Sharp Corp., Epson and Hitachi Displays. AUO is the only company
that has refused to yield.</P>
      <P>Local stock market analysts said the U.S. court's travel ban on AUO executives
is not expected to seriously affect the company's share prices because AUO has a
well-devised management scheme and its executives  can still maintain  close
contact with its Taipei headquarters. (Aug. 23, 2010).</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>AUO management has stressed that the company is prepared to fight a long legal
battle against the U.S. price-fixing charges.</P>
      <P>"We are clean and will not plead guilty, " an AUO executive said, adding that
the company has a lot of evidence to prove its integrity.</P>
      <P>Legal experts familiar with U.S. anti-trust cases said the conviction rate is
usually below 50 percent but the process is long and tedious. That's why many
corporations usually choose to plead guilty in the first place, they said.</P>
      <P>AUO has set aside a budget of NT$10 billion (US$312.5 million) in preparation
for the legal battle.</P>
      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih expressed concern Sunday about the fate of the three AUO
executives. Wu said although he is not in any position to try to intervene in
the judicial procedure, he has instructed Taiwanese officials posted in San
Francisco to gain a better understanding of the incident and to render
assistance if possible. (Aug. 23, 2010).</P>

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Poet Yang Wan-li once wrote during the Southern Sung dynasty that some families
were happy and some were sad as people in the south were leading peaceful lives
while those in the north were miserable because of the invasion by the
barbarians from the north.</P>
      <P>Paraphrasing that poem, we could say that some rich people in Taiwan are happy,
but many living below the poverty line or on the other side of the wealth gap
are sad.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has had a raft of good news that could make its people happy. The good
news includes a year-on-year economic growth of 13.1 percent in the first half
of the year, a forecast of a 21-year record high of 8.24 percent GDP growth for
the whole of 2010, and strong exports in July that were the fourth highest in
value ever.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, many people, particularly those from low-income families and
ordinary wage and salary earners, are unhappy, as the new benefits of economic
growth have not trickled down to everyone.</P>
      <P>The latest government statistics show that the income gap between Taiwan's
richest and poorest households has grown 66 times over the last 11 years.</P>
      <P>Equitable distribution of wealth is the bedrock of a "common people's economy,"
Premier Wu Den-yih has advocated.</P>
      <P>If it is not possible for the government to effectively bridge the gap between
rich and poor, it should at least take some steps, such a imposing a luxury tax
and giving a moderate pay raise to civil servants, to address the issue.

      <P>Hon Hai Precision Industry, the world's largest contract maker of electronics
products, is likely to see strong revenue growth next year, as orders for
Apple's new iPhones are expected to arrive early, analysts said Monday.</P>
      <P>Industry analysts have said that Apple is likely to launch iPhone 5 early next
year as there have been a lot of issues with its iPhone 4 and that all iPhone-
related shares will benefit.</P>
      <P>Benson Huang, analyst with Taiwan International Securities, said that if iPhone
5 is launched early next year, instead of in June or July, then Hon Hai's
revenue for the whole year will rise.</P>
      <P>"Apple's orders usually boost Hon Hai's revenues in the second half of the year,
but if Hon Hai receives iPhone orders in January, it will see several injections
of revenue," Huang said.</P>
      <P>It was reported in the local media Monday that Hon Hai, which makes Apple's
iPads and iPhones, is expected to receive orders for 80 million units to 100
million iPhones and 40 million iPads in 2011.</P>
      <P>This is expected to push Hon Hai's revenues next year up to NT$3 trillion (US$94
billion) -- the highest for private enterprises in Taiwan, the reports said.</P>
      <P>Hon Hai declined to comment on the report, but Huang said that most investors
are likely to believe any positive news about the company.</P>
      <P>Kevin Lin, senior vice president of Fuh Hong Financial Planning Co., also said
that the local market is quite confident that Hon Hai will receive more iPhone
and iPad orders next year.</P>
      <P>"As long as a company's business is related to those Apple devices, it will
enjoy prosperous growth to the end of this year and into next year," Lin said.</P>
      <P>In late morning trade, Hon Hai shares rose NT$1.00, or 0.74 percent, to
NT$135.50.</P>

    <DATELINE>08/23/10  13:43:03
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) released
its latest statistics and projection for Taiwan's gross domestic product (GDP)
last week.</P>
      <P>According to its statistics, Taiwan's year-on-year GDP growth reached 13.71
percent for the first quarter of this year, far higher than previous forecasts
of 8.96 percent and 9.24 percent made in November 2009 and February 2010,
respectively.</P>
      <P>Similar deviation was also seen in its forecasts for the annual GDP growth rates
for the second quarter of the year. The Q2 growth rate of 12.53 percent was more
than double the 6.05 percent forecast in February and also far surpassed a May
forecast of 7.66 percent.</P>
      <P>Local academics have said the DGBAS tends to be relatively conservative in
making growth projections when the economy is booming, and inclined to paint
overly optimistic pictures during recession.</P>
      <P>For instance, it forecast 4.3 percent annual GDP growth for 2008 when the global
economy was already slowing steadily. It turned out that Taiwan only posted a
meager 0.73 percent growth that year. When the global economy came to a sudden
freeze at the end of 2008, the DGBAS still forecast 2.12 percent GDP growth for
2009. Much to its disappointment, Taiwan experienced its worst recession in
decades last year.</P>
      <P>GDP  statistics  and forecasting  reflect  the government's competence and
operational efficiency. It's time for the DGBAS to build up a new economic
projecting model to more accurately discern or identify changing economic
development trends and chart response strategies in a more timely manner.

      <P>Several civic groups called on the government Sunday to raise the minimum wage,
revoke its pre-assessment of income for the jobless and raise taxes on the rich
and on business conglomerates in order to close the wealth gap in the country.</P>
      <P>Wang Jung-chang, head of the Alliance for Fair Tax Reform, said at a news
conference that the government has been inert on the issue.</P>
      <P>Government statistics for 2008 show that the income gap between Taiwan's richest
and poorest households grew 66 times wider over the previous decade.</P>
      <P>Wang said the alliance anticipated the wealth disparity problem a long time ago
and has been urging the government to take the issue seriously. However, the
government has not only turned a deaf ear but sees the problem as "not too bad,"
he said.</P>
      <P>Lucas Hu, a member of Youth Labor Union 95, called on the government to raise
the minimum wage, which he said would benefit the atypical workforce.</P>
      <P>Supporting this view, Taiwan Labor Front Director-General Wu Yu-hsiang said that
the Council of Labor Affairs should raise the minimum wage to at least NT$22,000
per month to allow workers to cover their basic living expenses.</P>
      <P>Regarding pre-assessment of taxable income for the unemployed, Taiwan Women's
Link Director Lin Lu-hung said this should be revoked.</P>
      <P>Under the current regulations, the government taxes long-term unemployed
individuals between the ages of 16 and 65 on an assessed income of NT$17,280 per
month.</P>
      <P>Once such individuals are not in school, severely ill or disabled, they are
required to pay taxes based on this income assessment and are not eligible for
social welfare, although some of them are living near or below the poverty line,
Lin said.</P>

      <P>Students from 27 universities around the country have launched a campaign to end
the euthanizing of stray animals found on Taiwan's campuses, a conservationist
told the Central News Agency Monday.</P>
      <P>Members of 29 student groups from the universities gathered in Taipei Aug. 13-15
for the first annual meeting of a league that aims to protect stray animals, and
particularly stray dogs, said Chou Chin-shan, a spokeswoman for the non-profit
Life Conservationist Association of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>It was resolved at the meeting that the students will help create "no-kill
campuses" for stray animals, based on the belief that caring for animals is part
of showing respect for life.</P>
      <P>League members called on the Taiwanese public to stop using brutal, inhumane
methods to capture strays, and to stop euthanizing the animals.</P>
      <P>Instead, they suggested that a TNR (trap, neuter and release) program be
introduced on campuses to allow stray dogs to be caught using humane methods and
neutered before being released to stay on campus or be adopted by dog lovers.</P>
      <P>Participants at the meeting suggested that when spotting stray dogs on the
campus, faculty or students find out why the animals are there before notifying
government centers to have the animals captured and killed.</P>
      <P>They also suggested that university authorities help student bodies financially
to facilitate animal management on campus.</P>
      <P>The TNR program, first launched at National Taiwan University in Taipei City in
2006, has also been promoted and implemented at National Chengchi University and
National Yangming University in Taipei City, as well as Tamkang University in
Taipei County, Chou said.</P>
      <P>According to tallies compiled by the Council of Agriculture, a total of 68,018
stray animals were captured nationwide and sent to animal centers in 2002. The
figure had risen to 132,905 by 2008 and was 125,106 in 2009.</P>
      <P>Of these animals, 42,222 were euthanized in 2002, and the figure grew to 93,205

      <P>Taiwan share prices closed higher Monday as a rise in financial shares and
heavy-weight electronics stocks offset the impact of a Wall Street drop on
Friday, dealers said.</P>
      <P>With local banks expected to reveal their China strategies at upcoming briefings
to institutional investors, most investors pinned their hope on a brighter
outlook for domestic banks following approval to expand their business in China,
dealers said.</P>
      <P>The weighted index rose 48.62 points or 0.61 percent to 7,975.93, after moving
between 7,924.10 and 8,013.12 on turnover of NT$122.56 billion (US$3.8 billion).</P>
      <P>A total of 1,903 stocks closed up and 1,860 were down, with 298 remaining
unchanged.</P>
      <P>The cement sector posted the highest gains, up 2.6 percent. Financial shares
rose 2.2 percent, construction issues moved up 2.0 percent, and textile shares
added 1.6 percent.</P>
      <P>Plastics and chemical issues gained 1.3 percent, the paper and pulp sector
closed up 0.7 percent, and machinery and electronics stocks edged up 0.1
percent, while foodstuffs fell 0.5 percent.</P>
      <P>Smartphones and touch panel makers also performed relatively well,  dealers
said,  adding that the buying in heavy-weight electronics shares pushed the
index above the 8,000 level before the market mood turned cautious.</P>
      <P>Kevin Lin, senior vice president at Fuh Hong Financial Planning Co., said that
HTC's record-high close and the rise in Hon Hai helped stabilize the market
despite losses on Wall Street and neighboring stock markets.</P>
      <P>Smartphone maker HTC jumped NT$25, or 4 percent, to NT$644. Hon Hai, the maker
of Apple's iPads and iPhones, rose NT$0.5, or 0.4 percent, to NT$135.</P>
      <P>But there was still room for improvement, Lin said.</P>
      <P>"The index will not be able to break the 8,000 level without stronger
electronics shares," Lin said.</P>
      <P>Benson Huang, an analyst at Taiwan International Securities, said that the
turnover would have to expand to at least NT$130 billion for the index to stand
firm above the 8,000 level.</P>
      <P>Huang said that most people took a wait-and-see attitude before the Unites
States releases its latest GDP figures and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke
delivers a speech on the U.S. economic outlook later this week.</P>
      <P>"The U.S. economic outlook is being closely watched by investors because it will
affect Taiwan's electronics industry," Huang said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan and the United States have agreed to begin negotiations  on cooperation
in the area of e-commerce, a development that can be seen as a precursor to the
resumption  of bilateral talks under the Trade and Investment Framework
Agreement (TIFA), Minister without Portfolio Yiin Chii-ming said in Los Angeles
Sunday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and the United States signed the TIFA in September 1994, but the United
States has suspended bilateral talks under this framework several times since in
1998.</P>
      <P>The e-commerce cooperation negotiations between the two countries are likely to
serve as stepping stone to TIFA talks, Yiin said.</P>
      <P>Since Taiwan signed an economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) with
China in June it has been stepping up it efforts to forge free trade agreements
(FTAs) with other countries, Yiin said.</P>
      <P>Earlier this month, it reached an agreement with Singapore to explore the
possibility of signing an economic cooperation agreement.</P>
      <P>At the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) ministerial meetings, Taiwan's
proposal to start FTA talks with other countries has been warmly received, Yiin
said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taiwan and China have agreed to start negotiations on agreements on
trade in products and services, investment, and dispute resolution, within six
months after the ECFA takes effect, he said.</P>
      <P>The arrangements for trade in goods and services "should not be too difficult, "
given that 20-30 percent of products in Taiwan and China have already been
granted tariff-free treatment under the ECFA and the fact that most information
technology products are also eligible  for zero-tariffs  under the World Trade
Organization framework.</P>
      <P>In the area of investment, there is no big difference of opinion between Taiwan
and China, he said.</P>
      <P>Addressing fears that certain local industries would suffer as a result of the
ECFA, Yiin said that the government will stick to its promise to delay trade
liberalization  in some areas to give vulnerable local industries time to adjust
and upgrade.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>After Taiwan's strong growth in the first half of the year fueled largely by
domestic demand, more investment is hoped for in the coming months to help lower
unemployment and narrow the rich-poor gap, Taiwan's economic policy planner said
Monday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's top statistics bureau reported on Aug. 19 that the country's GDP grew
by 12.5 percent in the second quarter of 2010, following 13.7 percent growth in
the first quarter.</P>
      <P>"The (strong growth) was not because it was being compared to a low baseline,
because the U.S. and Europe have not fully recovered, but mostly because of
domestic demand, " said Christina Liu, chairwoman of the Council for Economic
Planning and Development.</P>
      <P>Liu was speaking at a press conference during a break in an "Investing in
Taiwan" forum held in Taipei that attracted 915 representatives from more than
500 foreign and domestic business associations.</P>
      <P>Earlier at the forum, President Ma Ying-jeou said 87 percent of the growth in
the first quarter and 60 percent of the growth in the second quarter could be
attributed to domestic demand, of which investment played a major role.</P>
      <P>In both theory and practice, Liu said, investment and employment are closely
linked, so if investment is generating growth, then the employment picture is
likely to improve.</P>
      <P>Also, as companies' manpower needs increase, wages could be pushed slightly
higher, which could also help narrow the widening gap in income between rich and
poor, she said.</P>
      <P>Addressing the income gap has gained urgency recently after the government
announced, in conjunction with the overall economic growth figures, that the
average annual disposable income of Taiwan's top 20 percent income-earning
households was 6.34 times that of the bottom 20 percent income-earning
households in 2009.</P>
      <P>That was the widest gap since 2001, when the top 20 percent had average
disposable income that was 6.39 times that of the bottom 20 percent.</P>
      <P>Domestic demand has also assumed new importance, Liu said, because of the
changing structure of Taiwan's export sector.</P>
      <P>Though rising exports were able to boost employment in the export-oriented
economy of the past, local businesses have more recently been inclined to "take
orders in Taiwan and produce the orders overseas.</P>
      <P>"That doesn't help Taiwan's employment much,  " Liu said, contending that
growing domestic demand will change that structure.</P>

      <P>Two of Taiwan's top telecom carriers began to accept information Monday for
buyers to place pre-orders for Apple's new iPhone 4, which will be launched in
Taiwan in September.</P>
      <P>Although the new generation iPhone will be distributed by three instead of one
mobile carrier in Taiwan, each carrier is likely to have only about 5,000 to
10,000 units, which means the product will be in short supply, according to
reports.</P>
      <P>The new model will be distributed by Chunghwa Telecom, Taiwan's largest
telecommunications operator which has exclusive distributing rights to iPhone
3GS, as well as by Far Eastone Telecommunications and Taiwan Mobile.</P>
      <P>Both Far Eastone and Taiwan Mobile have begun accepting online pre-order
information and are asking people to leave their contact information so that
they can obtain iPhone 4 updates.</P>
      <P>However, Taiwan Mobile makes it clear on its website that completion of the
online registration process does not mean the order has been placed.</P>
      <P>Chunghwa Telecom said it will start taking online orders after it gets approval
from Apple.</P>
      <P>None of the three companies have as yet decided on their package rates for
iPhone 4.</P>

      <P>In a survey of the 300 Chinese  nationals  it has given non-invasive physicals

2009, Shin Kong Wu Ho Su Memorial Hospital in Taipei found that the exam was one

      <P>More than three-fourths of Taiwan's office workers would be interested in
joining the green power sector as they believe the industry has promising
prospects, a 1111 Job Bank's survey said.</P>
      <P>According to the survey released on Monday, 95 percent of respondents said they
thought the green power sector would flourish in the future, and 76 percent said
they would like to find a job in a related field.</P>
      <P>Major reasons cited by respondents for their interest were "positive  industry
prospects"  (63.48 percent) ,  "identifying themselves with environmental
protection" (61.24 percent)  and "personal interest" (46.63 percent).</P>
      <P>Among the reasons for their confidence  in the industry's prospects, "global
trend" topped the list (74.76 percent) , while other reasons mentioned included
"global energy crisis" (44.76 percent) and "the need for environmental
protection" (38.57 percent).</P>
      <P>In contrast, 23 percent of respondents said they would not join the green power
sector, mainly because of "a lack of professional ability."</P>
      <P>"Jobs in the green power sector usually require specialized skills, which lifts
the threshold for entering the field," said Henry Ho, the public relations
director of 1111 Job Bank.</P>
      <P>Ho suggested that people who are interested in green jobs join enterprises that
make energy-saving and carbon-reducing efforts to develop related knowledge.</P>
      <P>The poll was conducted online on Aug. 6-19 with 1,105 valid responses. It has a

    <HEADLINE>Conservationists call for protection of humpback dolphins</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  23 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Wildlife protection activists urged the government Monday to designate a habitat
for Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins living off the nation's west coast that are
threatened by pollution.</P>
      <P>At a news conference, the activists also called on the government to address
potential pollution and other problems that could result from a project launched
by the Kuokuang Petrochemical Technology Corp., a subsidiary of CPC Taiwan Corp,
to build refineries on coastal wetland in Dacheng Township, Changhua County near
the estuary of the Jhuoshuei River.</P>
      <P>The waters along the Changhua coast are home to a dwindling population of the
dolphins, which are considered a national treasure by many Taiwanese.</P>
      <P>Environmentalists say the planned refineries will block the migration routes of
many fish that make up the bulk of the dolphins' diets.</P>
      <P>According to Matsu's Fish Conservation Union member Gan Chen-yi, Kuokuang
authorized Chou Lien-siang, a professor at National Taiwan University's College
of Life Science, to investigate threats to the survival of the endangered
dolphin species and come up with measures to save them.</P>
      <P>Allen Chao-lun Chen, a fellow at the Academia Sinica's Research Center  for
Biodiversity,  also  said  that Taiwanese  experts commissioned by Kuokuang have
injected NT$100 million in studying the species since 2005, but that they have
failed to have any papers concerning the conservation of Taiwan's humpback
dolphins published in international science journals.</P>
      <P>It is worrisome, Chen said, that the conclusions and inferences of the studies
have been taken as references for charting national policy even though they have
not been examined by international academic circles.</P>
      <P>Gan said that results of research teams' investigations should be examined by
the international academic community and used to devise measures for
conservation.</P>
      <P>She also accused Kuokuang of being reluctant to face the fact that the land
reclamation involved in the project is the root cause of the disappearance of
the dolphin's habitat.</P>
      <P>Yang Hong-chia, who in 1963 was the first person to record sightings of the
dolphins, said that there were less than 100 in the waters along Taiwan's coast,
compared to an estimate of more than 200 in 2006. The drop in numbers is mainly
due to the influence of various industrial development projects along the
coastline, he said.</P>
      <P>The Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins inhabit waters within three kilometers of
shore that are less than 30 meters deep, with no apparent preference for clear
or turbid water, Chen said, citing an international  journal on aquatic life.
The government should designate a habitat for the conservation of the species
based on the Wildlife Protection Act, he added.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's nominal unemployment rate rose marginally in July but the seasonally
adjusted rate fell to its lowest level in 19 months, according to figures
released by the country's statistics bureau Monday.</P>
      <P>Unemployment rose to 5.20 percent in July, an increase of 0.04 percentage points
from the previous month, as a new batch of graduates and summer interns entered
the job market, the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics
(DGBAS) said Monday.</P>
      <P>The seasonally adjusted jobless rate, however, fell for the 11th consecutive
month to 5.17 percent, down 0.03 percentage points from June.</P>
      <P>It was the lowest since the 5.07 percent rate recorded in December  2008,  just
as the global economic  meltdown  began undercutting employment.</P>
      <P>In July, the number of first-time unemployed job seekers rose 15,000 from June,
and the number of those who became jobless after quiting their jobs to seek
better opportunities was up 6,000, the DGBAS said.</P>
      <P>"The impact of new graduates is going to last until August. The jobless rate is
expected to fall from September and drop below 5 percent by the end of this
year, " said Liu Tian-syh, deputy director of the DGBAS' fourth division.</P>
      <P>The number of those who lost jobs due to business closures or downsizing fell
14,000 last month from June, while the number of those released from temporary
jobs decreased by 2,000, the agency said, signs of the improving economy.</P>
      <P>The DGBAS said on Aug. 19 that Taiwan's economy grew at a 12.53 percent pace in
the second quarter and raised its forecast for 2010 growth to 8.24 percent, up
from May's forecast of 6.14 percent.</P>
      <P>Exports grew 46.2 percent in the quarter, the fastest among its Asian peers.</P>
      <P>In the first seven months of this year, Taiwan's jobless rate averaged 5.43
percent, down 0.35 percentage points from a year earlier.</P>
      <P>In July, the number of eligible workers with jobs totaled 10.53 million, 0.52
percent more than in June and 2.72 percent more than in July 2009.</P>
      <P>Reducing the unemployment rate has been a pressing issue for the government.
Taiwan's second-quarter jobless rate of 5.2 percent was the highest among the
four Asian Tigers (also comprised of Singapore, Hong Kong and South Korea.)</P>
      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih has vowed to step down if his administration fails to bring
the unemployment rate below 5 percent by the end of this year.</P>

      <P>The second extra legislative session concluded Monday after ruling and
opposition party caucuses worked out a timetable to screen a package of legal
amendments for reforming the country's debt-laden national health insurance
(NHI) system.</P>
      <P>"Legislative whips of the ruling and opposition parties have agreed to address
the NHI reform package at Dec. 3 and Dec. 7 plenary sessions during which a
third reading will be completed to pave the way for its enactment, " Legislative
Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng said after chairing a coordination meeting.</P>
      <P>With caucus leaders of the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) and main opposition
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) coming to terms on the NHI reform bill
screening schedule, Wang also announced the closure of the second extraordinary
legislative session.</P>
      <P>According to Wang, Department of Health (DOH) Minister Yaung Chih-liang was
satisfied with the legislature's move to set a deadline for passing the NHI
reform package.</P>
      <P>Noting  that Yaung  has taken  part in every  legislative consultative meeting
in the past few months to explain details of the package in hopes of winning
legislative support, Wang said he was impressed and touched by his dedication
and strong sense of mission.</P>
      <P>"In the tedious inter-party coordination process, I vividly felt his firm
resolve to overhaul our health insurance system," Wang said, adding that since
the legislature has drawn up a time frame for passage of the reform package
immediately after the Nov.  27 municipality mayoral elections, Yaung does not
need to resign over the issue.</P>
      <P>Yaung had offered  to resign earlier this year after the legislature failed to
pass the NHI reform bill in its previous session. He also made no secret of his
intention to quit if the legislature continued to shelve the bill.</P>
      <P>According to the consensus reached Monday, 79 articles that have cleared
relevant legislative committees will not be discussed ahead of the Dec. 3 and
Dec. 7 plenary sessions.</P>
      <P>Inter-party consultations will focus on the 27 articles over which lawmakers
remain divided,  Wang said,  adding that the legislature will continue
negotiations with the DOH and public hearings will be called to solicit expert
opinions.</P>
      <P>The contentious provisions mainly deal with how premium rates should be set or
adjusted, Wang said.</P>
      <P>Legislative caucuses of various parties are required to present motions on
further revising the NHI reform package before Nov. 30, Wang said.</P>
      <P>He also expressed gratification for the accomplishments of the just-concluded
extraordinary legislative session that began Aug. 17.</P>
      <P>In addition to approving the newly signed economic cooperation framework
agreement (ECFA) with China and five related packages to facilitate its
implementation, the session also passed three drafts of legal amendments for
admission of Chinese students to local tertiary education institutions and 13
other bills.</P>
      <P>The next legislative session is scheduled to open Sept. 24, Wang said.</P>

      <P>Shocked after viewing more than two dozen home videos online that feature
parents giving cigarettes to young children, anti-smoking activists urged police
on Monday to heavily punish anyone found guilty of such "shameless and
detestable" acts.</P>
      <P>The John Tung Foundation publicized the 22 video clips at a press conference
after exposing two similar home videos on Aug. 17 that circulated on YouTube.</P>
      <P>The foundation said that since then it received more video clips sent to the
foundation by web users who downloaded them from local community websites,
including social networking site Wretch.</P>
      <P>They show that "forcing children to smoke is not an isolated incident" in
Taiwan, foundation chief executive Yao Si-yuan said.</P>
      <P>The videos were placed on the "family love, " "learn and growth" and "fun and
entertainment" pages, proof that the videos were made to entertain people, the
foundation said in a statement.</P>
      <P>The adults in the videos are seen treating smoking children as a kind of
performance at family gatherings, encouraging some children to hold a cigarette
in their mouths to imitate older family members, the foundation said.</P>
      <P>One of the videos featured a two-to-three-month-old baby with a cigarette in its
mouth. Another clip showed an adult forcibly remove a straw from a toddler's
mouth and replace it with a cigarette.</P>
      <P>At the press conference, actor-turned-volunteer Sun Yueh urged the government to
take measures to prevent parents from encouraging children to smoke as a form of
entertainment.</P>
      <P>Consumers' Foundation Vice Chairwoman Su Chin-hsia said that under the Children
and Youth Welfare Act and the Tobacco Hazard Act, anyone who offers underage
people cigarettes or encourages them to smoke is subject to a fine of between
NT$10,000 (US$313) and NT$50,000.</P>
      <P>Her foundation urged police to take legal action against the parents in the
video clips, Su said.</P>

      <P>Taiwanese golfer Lu Chien-soon shot a final round 3-under-par 69 to finish tied
for second in the Jeld-Wen Tradition in central Oregon, his best result since
joining the PGA Champions Tour at the beginning of the year.</P>
      <P>Lu, who earned the final exemption for this year's Champions Tour on the eighth
hole of a playoff at last year's Q-School, finished tied for second place with
Michael Allen at 11-under-par 277, one shot behind winner Fred Funk.</P>
      <P>It was his sixth top 10 finish in 11 events on tour this year, and his
performance this weekend left him ranked 12th on the Champions Tour 2010 money
list with winnings of US$681,478.</P>
      <P>Lu, who amassed 12 wins on the Asian PGA Tour, was out of golf from 2001-2008
with back problems before magically recovering in 2009, the result, he says, of
physical therapy and herbal medicines.</P>
      <P>In the Jen-Weld Tradition, Lu started poorly with rounds of 70 and 73, but a 65
on Saturday -- which tied for the best single round of the tournament -- pulled
him back into contention.</P>
      <P>Lu birdied the first, fifth and eighth holes to move to 11-under on the front
nine Sunday, but a double bogey on the par-4 tenth left him with too much ground
to make up against the consistent Funk, who won the tournament -- the fourth of
the Champions Tour's five majors -- for the second time in three years.</P>
      <P>Lu did have a chance to tie Funk at 18, but narrowly missed a 40-foot chip shot
for birdie.</P>
      <P>"I don't know how he missed that shot," Funk said.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's industrial production index surged 20.7 percent in July compared with
the same month of last year, boosted by strong orders in the electronics,

    <TEXT>
      <P>Wu Da-wei, known as "Z9" online, has been one of the most popular people on a
major bulletin board system (BBS) in Taiwan over the past seven years. His
influence is not from what he writes, however, but what he gathers and posts.</P>
      <P>"Every day I read Z9's board so I can grasp the hot topics on Ptt," university
student Kuo Yu-ting said when asked what drew her to Wu's personal board on
Ptt2.</P>
      <P>Ptt2, along with Ptt, are BBSs established and operated by a student group at
National Taiwan University (NTU) . Together, they receive tens of thousands of
hits per hour.</P>
      <P>Wu has posted other people's articles on topics ranging from news and sports to
gossip and jokes every day since he was a sophomore in NTU's Mechanical
Engineering Department.</P>
      <P>"To remain popular online, persistency is key," said Wu, who even had other
people maintain his board while he was serving in the military.  Today,  besides
being  an engineer  at a computer manufacturer, he heads a team of four people
that runs his board.</P>
      <P>He first made his name on Ptt as a freshman for his ability to find the identity
of unknown, good-looking girls based on online inquiries. Ptt has a popular
board for people hoping to locate girls they have seen in public. For example,
one user said he had seen an attractive girl at a post office in Taoyuan, and Wu
eventually tracked her down.</P>
      <P>Wu's board also became a place for girls who want to make a name for themselves
online and beyond. Every day he posts photo albums of attractive girls he finds
online. However, not everything is about girls. Wu stresses the variety of the
content he posts -- including a campaign to protest against NTU's 2009 plans to
remove an F-100A fighter jet displayed on campus.</P>
      <P>"For a week, I posted articles on developments pertaining to the issue on my
boards every day, " he said. With the students' campaign fueled by the online
community, the university backed down and kept the plane.</P>
      <P>"Our generation no longer just passively receives whatever information that is
offered, " Wu said, adding that the younger generation now actively seeks out
information through interaction and discussion with peers.</P>
      <P>Major businesses such as Microsoft and Samsung have noticed his influence and
consult him on marketing strategies aimed at students. Nokia's Taipei office
invited him to join its group of students to discuss seasonal advertising
campaigns.</P>
      <P>Competition for web users' attention is heating up, with many people copying his
method and setting up their own boards on various subjects. Wu, however, is
aiming even higher and plans to expand his online presence to include more than
just bulletin boards.</P>
      <P>"Now I want to have a website that gathers what's happening all over the
Internet," he said.</P>

      <P>The Air Force has handed over one of its hangars  at Taipei Songshan  Airport to
the Civil Aeronautics Administration, which will use it to accommodate private

      <P>Maj. Gen. Han Geng-sheng, deputy chief of staff of the Air Force, told a news
conference Monday that the hangar was transferred on Aug. 18 to the Civil
Aeronautics Administration "on loan, " although it will eventually be
permanently turned over to the administration after related legal procedures are
completed.</P>
      <P>"We absolutely support the government's policy to set up a business aviation
zone at the airport as long as it does not compromise the operation of the
Songshan Air Base," Han said.</P>
      <P>The Air Force will move equipment from the hangar to other hangars at the
airport, and "there is no possibility of any aircraft from the Air Force's fleet
of executive airplanes parking outdoors overnight," he said.</P>
      <P>Han made the statement to refute reports that the transfer of the hangar, which
has been used to accommodate the plane used by President  Ma Ying-jeou and
executive planes for other senior officials, would deprive the Air Force of a
place to house its executive aircraft.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Air Force will also hand over part of its Songshan Air Force base
to the Civil Aeronautics Administration in exchange for the administration's
promise to build new quarters and a mess hall for the Air Force base, Han said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Monday that Taiwan has scored initial results in
carbon reduction and energy conservation since he assumed office in May 2008.</P>
      <P>"We managed to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 5 percent last year after
trimming carbon emissions by 4.4 percent in 2008," Ma said while meeting with
Elinor Ostrom, a co-winner of the 2009 Nobel Prize in Economics.</P>
      <P>Ma said Taiwan will probably not match the results of the past two years in
carbon reduction and energy conservation in 2010 because of its strong economic
growth in the first half of the year -- 13.71 percent in the first quarter and
12.53 percent in the second quarter.</P>
      <P>But Taiwan's energy intensity -- the amount of energy used per unit of economic
output -- remains at only 9 percent, indicating that its energy efficiency is
relatively high, Ma said.</P>
      <P>Because global warming and climate change have had an enormous impact on Taiwan,
such as the loss of nearly 700 lives last August when Typhoon Morakot battered
Taiwan with strong winds and torrential rains, Ma said his administration has
made carbon reduction and energy conservation major policy goals.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan has been denied access to the United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change, it has voluntarily followed the convention's
provisions and worked out a timetable for carbon reduction that requires Taiwan
to slash its 2020 carbon emissions to the 2005 level and the 2025 emissions to
the 2000 level.</P>
      <P>Ostrom is known for her research and analysis of economic governance, especially
common public goods. Ma said he believes Ostrom's theory could be useful to
Taiwan as Taiwan has limited natural resources and often falls victim to natural
disasters.</P>
      <P>Ostrom has been invited by several local media and academic groups to deliver
speeches on issues regarding climate change and resources integration as Taiwan
faces the challenge of balancing economic development and environmental
protection.</P>

      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih asked Vice Premier Sean C. Chen Monday to study the
possibility of helping three executives from local TFT-LCD giant AU Optronics
(AUO) who have been barred from leaving the United States by a court in San
Francisco.</P>
      <P>According to a statement issued by the Government Information Office, Wu asked
Chen to work with Executive Yuan Secretary-General Lin Join-sane, officials from
the Foreign Affairs, Economic Affairs, and Justice ministries and local
attorneys to find ways to help the three men and, if possible, have the U.S
court lift the travel ban.</P>
      <P>Minister of Economic Affairs Shih Yen-shiang said separately on Monday that he
had contacted AUO Chairman K. Y. Lee to see what the government could do in the
case, promising to help in any way within the ministry's authority.</P>
      <P>AU Optronics Corp., the three executives -- AUO CEO Lai-juh Chen, and directors
Hsuan Bin Chen and Hui Hsiung -- and three others were indicted in June for
conspiring to fix prices of TFT-LCD glass panels with other industry rivals
between September 2001 and December 2006.</P>
      <P>They went to the United States to plea their cases, but the U.S. District Court
for the Northern District of California ruled on Aug. 19 that the three
executives would not be allowed to travel outside the U.S. without the
permission of the U.S. Pretrial Services Agency.</P>
      <P>The court acted at the request of prosecutors, who said the three men were
flight risks because they live and work in Taiwan, which has no extradition
agreement with the U.S.</P>
      <P>Though prohibited from leaving the U.S., the three are otherwise free to move
and carry out their jobs in Taiwan via teleconference, according to AUO sources.</P>
      <P>AUO has been one of many Asian TFT-LCD manufacturers indicted in the case.</P>
      <P>Four other TFT-LCD manufacturers, including Taiwan-based Chimei Optoelectronics
(now part of Chimei-Innolux Display) , and Chunghwa Picture Tubes, Ltd., South
Korea-based LG Display, and Japan-based Sharp, are among companies said to have
already pleaded guilty in plea bargains with prosecutors to avoid time-consuming
trials.</P>
      <P>Chimei's former President Ho Chao-yang was sentenced to 14 months' imprisonment
in the U.S. while three executives of Chunghwa Picture Tubes were each given
nine months in jail.</P>
      <P>AUO has refused to plea bargain, insisting on its innocent and saying it would
clear its name in court.</P>

      <P>MOFA spokesman Henry Chen said the ministry made immediate contact with the
Taipei Economic and Cultural Office (TECO) in the Philippines following the
incident and made sure no Taiwanese nationals were injured in the incident.</P>
      <P>Philippines-based Taiwanese businessmen have also been accounted for, Chen said.</P>
      <P>The ministry has no immediate plans so far to raise the travel alert from gray

      <P>A gray light is the lowest of the four-level travel warning system used by MOFA

      <P>Iranian artist Shahab Fotouhi will collaborate with local politicians to create
a video artwork to be presented both on cable TV and at the Taipei Biennial at
the Taipei Fine Arts Museum in September, the museum said on Monday.</P>
      <P>The work, entitled "Elevator Pitch," will take the form of a talk show and
provide a quick overview of cultural issues in Taipei. Fotouhi invited Iranian
curator Tirdad Zolghadr to appear as a moderator in the video, which will also
include Chen Yu-chiou, ex-minister of the Council for Cultural Affairs, and
Joanna Lei, a former Kuomintang (KMT) legislator. The group will discuss
cultural issues such as the Taipei International Floral Exhibition and this
year's Taipei Biennial.</P>
      <P>Before recording at the Unique Satellite TV studio in Taipei Monday afternoon,
Zolghadr said that the concept of the video was not inspired by local TV shows,
but was based on similar works the artist has previously presented about Iranian
political issues.</P>
      <P>With the involvement of local politicians and the use of a real TV network,
Fotouhi will blur the line between art and reality, museum organizers said.</P>
      <P>Lei said she hoped through her participation to emphasize the importance of
collaboration.</P>
      <P>"We should cooperate to elevate competitiveness while holding the floral expo
and the biennial at the same time," she said.</P>
      <P>Chen, an artist herself, stressed the importance of the public becoming involved
in the arts.</P>
      <P>The 25-minute program will air on Sept. 4 at 11 a.m. on Unique Satellite TV,
channel 58, as well as be presented at the exhibition, which runs from Sept. 7
through Nov. 14.</P>
      <P>The work will be shown among 38 other works by 24 artists, as well a section
entitled Artist Cinema that will include 38 films. By Sunnie Chen</P>

      <P>A commemoration ceremony was held in Kinmen Monday to remember the soldiers who
sacrificed their lives in resisting China's intense shelling of the island more
than 50 years ago.</P>
      <P>Kinmen Defense Commander Chang Ching-hsiang and Kinmen County Magistrate Li Wo-
shih led the ceremony in a Kinmen cemetery to mourn the soldiers who lost their
lives in the battle that began on Aug. 23, 1958, also known as the 823 Artillery
Bombardment.</P>
      <P>"All Taiwanese should be grateful to the elder heroes because our peaceful life
today has been made posible by their valiant efforts that cost them their
lives," Chang said.</P>
      <P>Chang also offered his respect on behalf of the Kinmen Defense Command to 77
veterans who survived the shelling and were invited to attend the ceremony.</P>
      <P>Echoing Chang, Lee saluted the veterans and said people should remember the
heavy price of war and promote peace across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Earlier on Sunday, the 77 veterans urged the government to include information
about the bombardment in school textbooks and take better care of veterans'
lives.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan-held islands of Kinmen and Matsu, which lie closer to China's
southeastern coast than to Taiwan, were the front lines in hostilities between
China and Taiwan during the Cold War.</P>
      <P>Their contribution and the sacrifices of soldiers posted there, will also be
recognized through a series of activities on Aug. 23, 2011 as part of next
year's centennial celebration of the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>Council for Cultural Affairs minister Emile Sheng announced Monday that a peace
bell will be rung that day on the two islands -- which have been part of the
ROC's territory for 100 years -- to promote the idea of peace.</P>
      <P>In the shelling in 1958, over 470,000 shells from Chinese forces were fired at
the 150 square kilometer island over 44 days as a prelude to a communist
invasion, but the Nationalist troops withstood the bombardment, successfully
deterring any attempt to invade Taiwan.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Monday he believes Taiwan's income gap will shrink
next year thanks to growth in domestic demand in the first half of this year.</P>
      <P>Addressing the opening of a seminar on investing in Taiwan, Ma said much of
Taiwan's economic growth in the first two quarters of this year was generated by
domestic demand.</P>
      <P>Although that growth in domestic demand may not immediately be positively
reflected in employment and wealth distribution figures, it will gradually
contribute to job creation and lead to more equitable distribution of wealth
under the correct development strategy, Ma said.</P>
      <P>By next year, he said confidently, Taiwan's income gap will gradually narrow.</P>
      <P>Statistics issued recently by the government show that the income gap between
the richest 20 percent of families in Taiwan and the poorest 20 percent rose to
a record 8.22 times in 2009, demonstrating that wealth distribution is becoming
increasingly polarized.</P>
      <P>Ma said domestic demand accounted for 87 percent of Taiwan's 13.71 percent
growth in gross domestic product (GDP) in the first quarter of the year and 60
percent of the Q2 growth rate of 12.53 percent.</P>
      <P>In addition to a stronger-than-expected economic recovery that has enhanced
Taiwan's appeal for foreign investors, Ma said his administration has adopted
many other measures to improve the investment climate, including increasing
public spending on research and development by at least 8 percent annually,
easing restrictions and updating regulations.</P>
      <P>Over the past two years, Ma said, 540 laws and acts have been amended to make
Taiwan more business- and investment-friendly.</P>
      <P>Before he assumed office, the president said, more than 60 Taiwanese companies
were listed in Hong Kong. But after recent reductions in the estate and gift
taxes, many of them returned to Taiwan to seek new investment opportunities.</P>
      <P>Contending that the signing of an economic cooperation framework agreement with
China has helped Taiwan break through its diplomatic isolation, Ma said his
administration will actively reach out to the world in the years ahead.</P>
      <P>Besides exploring the feasibility of an economic cooperation agreement with
Singapore, Ma said, Taiwan is also looking to sign free trade agreement-like
pacts with its other major trading partners.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Wu Da-wei, known as "Z9" online, has been one of the most popular people on a
major bulletin board system (BBS) in Taiwan over the past seven years. His
influence is not from what he writes, however, but what he gathers and posts.</P>
      <P>"Every day I read Z9's board so I can grasp the hot topics on Ptt," university
student Kuo Yu-ting said when asked what drew her to Wu's personal board on
Ptt2.</P>
      <P>Ptt2, along with Ptt, are BBSs established and operated by a student group at
National Taiwan University (NTU) . Together, they receive tens of thousands of
hits per hour.</P>
      <P>Wu has posted other people's articles on topics ranging from news and sports to
gossip and jokes every day since he was a sophomore in NTU's Mechanical
Engineering Department.</P>
      <P>"To remain popular online, persistency is key," said Wu, who even had other
people maintain his board while he was serving in the military.  Today,  besides
being  an engineer  at a computer manufacturer, he heads a team of four people
that runs his board.</P>
      <P>He first made his name on Ptt as a freshman for his ability to find the identity
of unknown, good-looking girls based on online inquiries. Ptt has a popular
board for people hoping to locate girls they have seen in public. For example,
one user said he had seen an attractive girl at a post office in Taoyuan, and Wu
eventually tracked her down.</P>
      <P>Wu's board also became a place for girls who want to make a name for themselves
online and beyond. Every day he posts photo albums of attractive girls he finds
online. However, not everything is about girls. Wu stresses the variety of the
content he posts -- including a campaign to protest against NTU's 2009 plans to
remove an F-100A fighter jet displayed on campus.</P>
      <P>"For a week, I posted articles on developments pertaining to the issue on my
boards every day, " he said. With the students' campaign fueled by the online
community, the university backed down and kept the plane.</P>
      <P>"Our generation no longer just passively receives whatever information that is
offered, " Wu said, adding that the younger generation now actively seeks out
information through interaction and discussion with peers.</P>
      <P>Major businesses such as Microsoft and Samsung have noticed his influence and
consult him on marketing strategies aimed at students. Nokia's Taipei office
invited him to join its group of students to discuss seasonal advertising
campaigns.</P>
      <P>Competition for web users' attention is heating up, with many people copying his
method and setting up their own boards on various subjects. Wu, however, is
aiming even higher and plans to expand his online presence to include more than
just bulletin boards.</P>
      <P>"Now I want to have a website that gathers what's happening all over the
Internet," he said.</P>

      <P>The Air Force has handed over one of its hangars  at Taipei Songshan  Airport to
the Civil Aeronautics Administration, which will use it to accommodate private
jets as part of the country's first business aviation area.</P>
      <P>Maj. Gen. Han Geng-sheng, deputy chief of staff of the Air Force, told a news
conference Monday that the hangar was transferred on Aug. 18 to the Civil
Aeronautics Administration "on loan, " although it will eventually be
permanently turned over to the administration after related legal procedures are
completed.</P>
      <P>"We absolutely support the government's policy to set up a business aviation
zone at the airport as long as it does not compromise the operation of the
Songshan Air Base," Han said.</P>
      <P>The Air Force will move equipment from the hangar to other hangars at the
airport, and "there is no possibility of any aircraft from the Air Force's fleet
of executive airplanes parking outdoors overnight," he said.</P>
      <P>Han made the statement to refute reports that the transfer of the hangar, which
has been used to accommodate the plane used by President  Ma Ying-jeou and
executive planes for other senior officials, would deprive the Air Force of a
place to house its executive aircraft.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Air Force will also hand over part of its Songshan Air Force base
to the Civil Aeronautics Administration in exchange for the administration's
promise to build new quarters and a mess hall for the Air Force base, Han said.</P>
      <P>The business aviation zone, which is part of President Ma Ying-jeou's plan to
make Taipei a regional business hub, will begin operations by the end of
November, according to Monday's China Times.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Monday that Taiwan has scored initial results in
carbon reduction and energy conservation since he assumed office in May 2008.</P>
      <P>"We managed to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 5 percent last year after
trimming carbon emissions by 4.4 percent in 2008," Ma said while meeting with
Elinor Ostrom, a co-winner of the 2009 Nobel Prize in Economics.</P>
      <P>Ma said Taiwan will probably not match the results of the past two years in
carbon reduction and energy conservation in 2010 because of its strong economic
growth in the first half of the year -- 13.71 percent in the first quarter and
12.53 percent in the second quarter.</P>
      <P>But Taiwan's energy intensity -- the amount of energy used per unit of economic
output -- remains at only 9 percent, indicating that its energy efficiency is
relatively high, Ma said.</P>
      <P>Because global warming and climate change have had an enormous impact on Taiwan,
such as the loss of nearly 700 lives last August when Typhoon Morakot battered
Taiwan with strong winds and torrential rains, Ma said his administration has
made carbon reduction and energy conservation major policy goals.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan has been denied access to the United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change, it has voluntarily followed the convention's
provisions and worked out a timetable for carbon reduction that requires Taiwan
to slash its 2020 carbon emissions to the 2005 level and the 2025 emissions to
the 2000 level.</P>
      <P>Ostrom is known for her research and analysis of economic governance, especially
common public goods. Ma said he believes Ostrom's theory could be useful to
Taiwan as Taiwan has limited natural resources and often falls victim to natural
disasters.</P>
      <P>Ostrom has been invited by several local media and academic groups to deliver
speeches on issues regarding climate change and resources integration as Taiwan
faces the challenge of balancing economic development and environmental
protection.</P>

      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih asked Vice Premier Sean C. Chen Monday to study the
possibility of helping three executives from local TFT-LCD giant AU Optronics
(AUO) who have been barred from leaving the United States by a court in San
Francisco.</P>
      <P>According to a statement issued by the Government Information Office, Wu asked
Chen to work with Executive Yuan Secretary-General Lin Join-sane, officials from
the Foreign Affairs, Economic Affairs, and Justice ministries and local
attorneys to find ways to help the three men and, if possible, have the U.S
court lift the travel ban.</P>
      <P>Minister of Economic Affairs Shih Yen-shiang said separately on Monday that he
had contacted AUO Chairman K. Y. Lee to see what the government could do in the
case, promising to help in any way within the ministry's authority.</P>
      <P>AU Optronics Corp., the three executives -- AUO CEO Lai-juh Chen, and directors
Hsuan Bin Chen and Hui Hsiung -- and three others were indicted in June for
conspiring to fix prices of TFT-LCD glass panels with other industry rivals
between September 2001 and December 2006.</P>
      <P>They went to the United States to plea their cases, but the U.S. District Court
for the Northern District of California ruled on Aug. 19 that the three
executives would not be allowed to travel outside the U.S. without the
permission of the U.S. Pretrial Services Agency.</P>
      <P>The court acted at the request of prosecutors, who said the three men were
flight risks because they live and work in Taiwan, which has no extradition
agreement with the U.S.</P>
      <P>Though prohibited from leaving the U.S., the three are otherwise free to move
and carry out their jobs in Taiwan via teleconference, according to AUO sources.</P>
      <P>AUO has been one of many Asian TFT-LCD manufacturers indicted in the case.</P>
      <P>Four other TFT-LCD manufacturers, including Taiwan-based Chimei Optoelectronics
(now part of Chimei-Innolux Display) , and Chunghwa Picture Tubes, Ltd., South
Korea-based LG Display, and Japan-based Sharp, are among companies said to have
already pleaded guilty in plea bargains with prosecutors to avoid time-consuming
trials.</P>
      <P>Chimei's former President Ho Chao-yang was sentenced to 14 months' imprisonment
in the U.S. while three executives of Chunghwa Picture Tubes were each given
nine months in jail.</P>
      <P>AUO has refused to plea bargain, insisting on its innocent and saying it would
clear its name in court.</P>

      <P>A commemoration ceremony was held in Kinmen Monday to remember the soldiers who
sacrificed their lives in resisting China's intense shelling of the island more
than 50 years ago.</P>
      <P>Kinmen Defense Commander Chang Ching-hsiang and Kinmen County Magistrate Li Wo-
shih led the ceremony in a Kinmen cemetery to mourn the soldiers who lost their
lives in the battle that began on Aug. 23, 1958, also known as the 823 Artillery
Bombardment.</P>
      <P>"All Taiwanese should be grateful to the elder heroes because our peaceful life
today has been made posible by their valiant efforts that cost them their
lives," Chang said.</P>
      <P>Chang also offered his respect on behalf of the Kinmen Defense Command to 77
veterans who survived the shelling and were invited to attend the ceremony.</P>
      <P>Echoing Chang, Lee saluted the veterans and said people should remember the
heavy price of war and promote peace across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Earlier on Sunday, the 77 veterans urged the government to include information
about the bombardment in school textbooks and take better care of veterans'
lives.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan-held islands of Kinmen and Matsu, which lie closer to China's
southeastern coast than to Taiwan, were the front lines in hostilities between
China and Taiwan during the Cold War.</P>
      <P>Their contribution and the sacrifices of soldiers posted there, will also be
recognized through a series of activities on Aug. 23, 2011 as part of next
year's centennial celebration of the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>Council for Cultural Affairs minister Emile Sheng announced Monday that a peace
bell will be rung that day on the two islands -- which have been part of the
ROC's territory for 100 years -- to promote the idea of peace.</P>
      <P>In the shelling in 1958, over 470,000 shells from Chinese forces were fired at
the 150 square kilometer island over 44 days as a prelude to a communist
invasion, but the Nationalist troops withstood the bombardment, successfully
deterring any attempt to invade Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Wealth gap to shrink next year: president</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Monday he believes Taiwan's income gap will shrink
next year thanks to growth in domestic demand in the first half of this year.</P>
      <P>Addressing the opening of a seminar on investing in Taiwan, Ma said much of
Taiwan's economic growth in the first two quarters of this year was generated by
domestic demand.</P>
      <P>Although that growth in domestic demand may not immediately be positively
reflected in employment and wealth distribution figures, it will gradually
contribute to job creation and lead to more equitable distribution of wealth
under the correct development strategy, Ma said.</P>
      <P>By next year, he said confidently, Taiwan's income gap will gradually narrow.</P>
      <P>Statistics issued recently by the government show that the income gap between
the richest 20 percent of families in Taiwan and the poorest 20 percent rose to
a record 8.22 times in 2009, demonstrating that wealth distribution is becoming
increasingly polarized.</P>
      <P>Ma said domestic demand accounted for 87 percent of Taiwan's 13.71 percent
growth in gross domestic product (GDP) in the first quarter of the year and 60
percent of the Q2 growth rate of 12.53 percent.</P>
      <P>In addition to a stronger-than-expected economic recovery that has enhanced
Taiwan's appeal for foreign investors, Ma said his administration has adopted
many other measures to improve the investment climate, including increasing
public spending on research and development by at least 8 percent annually,
easing restrictions and updating regulations.</P>
      <P>Over the past two years, Ma said, 540 laws and acts have been amended to make
Taiwan more business- and investment-friendly.</P>
      <P>Before he assumed office, the president said, more than 60 Taiwanese companies
were listed in Hong Kong. But after recent reductions in the estate and gift
taxes, many of them returned to Taiwan to seek new investment opportunities.</P>
      <P>Contending that the signing of an economic cooperation framework agreement with
China has helped Taiwan break through its diplomatic isolation, Ma said his
administration will actively reach out to the world in the years ahead.</P>
      <P>Besides exploring the feasibility of an economic cooperation agreement with
Singapore, Ma said, Taiwan is also looking to sign free trade agreement-like
pacts with its other major trading partners.</P>

      <P>The Yunlin County government said Monday that local residents had agreed to
accept an offer of NT$500 million (US$15.63 million) in compensation from the
Formosa Plastics Group (FPG) for agricultural and fishery losses caused by
recent fires at the group's petrochemical complex in Mailiao, Yunlin County.</P>
      <P>Officials from Mailiao and the neighboring Taisi village agreed to the
compensation offer,  according to Yunlin County Deputy Magistrate Lin Yuan-

      <P>"After agreeing to the settlement, the next step will be to process the
compensation applications," Lin said.</P>
      <P>As for the development of a feedback mechanism requested by local residents, it
will be discussed at further meetings, Lin said.</P>
      <P>Formosa Plastics agreed to pay a maximum of NT$500 million in compensation for
losses suffered after fires broke out at the complex on July 7 and July 25
during a meeting with Yunlin County Magistrate Su Chih-fen last Monday.</P>
      <P>But local residents were dissatisfied with the amount, and they blocked all
major roads leading to the complex for most of the following week before
temporarily suspending the blockade last Saturday and Sunday.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Talk of the day -- To raise or not to raise wages</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>08/24/10  11:12:39
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The issue of whether public-sector wages should be raised has become a focus of
discussion in recent days. Although Premier Wu Den-yih decided last week against
a pay raise for civil servants, the top leadership reportedly may agree to offer
a higher year-end bonus to government employees if tax revenues increase.</P>
      <P>Wage levels in the private sector are also a topic of concern. According to the
latest government statistics, domestic average wages rose in the first half of
this year as compared with the year-earlier level, but still failed to return to
levels seen before the 2008-2009 global financial crisis. More frustrating is
that today's average real wage is lower than in 1998.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from local media coverage of the issue:</P>
      <P>Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>Statistics released by the Directorate  General of Budget, Accounting and
Statistics (DGBAS) show that the nominal average wage for employed people
amounted to NT$47,392 for the first six months of this year, up 7.37 percent
year-on-year. The growth rate marked the largest annual gain in 17 years.</P>
      <P>Liu Tien-su,  deputy director of the DGBAS Fourth Bureau, attributed the gain in
part to a relatively low baseline of comparison as the country was mired in a
recession last year. Another factor lies in the economic recovery, which has
helped boost corporate profitability.</P>
      <P>The real or inflation-adjusted wage for the same period stood at NT$45,161,
marking a 6.1 percent year-on-year gain, according to DGBAS tallies. The amount,
however, was still lower than NT$45,596 posted in 1998. The figure means
Taiwan's wage growth has not matched the inflation rate, causing average real
wages to fall below the level posted 13 years ago. (Aug. 24, 2010).</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>Son Yu-lian, secretary-general of Taiwan Labor Front, said a pay raise for
government employees may help inspire private companies to follow suit.</P>
      <P>"But the real effect remains uncertain as wage earners lack powerful bargaining
chips in wage negotiations with employers, " Son said.</P>
      <P>In his view, the first thing the government should do now is raise the minimum
wage, which has not been adjusted for three years.</P>
      <P>Ruling Kuomintang Legislator Ho Tsai-feng said she supports Son's appeal because
the upward adjustment in the minimum wage will not increase the government's
financial burden and can instead stimulate domestic consumption to bolster
further economic growth.</P>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin and Taichung Mayor Jason Hu, both of whom are running
in the municipality mayoral elections, said the government should at least raise
the pay of lower-echelon civil servants by 1 percent or 2 percent to boost their
morale.</P>
      <P>Eric Liluan Chu and Yang Chiu-hsing, candidates running for mayorship of Xinbei
and Kaohsiung municipalities respectively, also threw their support behind the
proposal.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Alex Fai said the central government should consider offering a
modest pay raise for grassroots public-sector employees to let them enjoy a
piece of the domestic economic recovery.</P>
      <P>With the economy regaining momentum,  the government's tax revenues will
definitely increase this year to help finance the proposed pay raise, Fai said.</P>
      <P>As the corporate income tax rate will also drop from September, Fai said, local
companies should also raise the wages of their lower-ranking employees to share
with them the benefits of economic growth. (Aug. 24, 2010).</P>

    <DATELINE>08/24/10  11:33:53

    <TEXT>
      <P>According to Gallup's latest Potential Net Migration Index, Taiwan would see a
net 21 percent decrease in its population if everyone who wanted to come in and
wanted to leave could do so.</P>
      <P>To explore this complicated problem, we should first get an idea of the
background of those Taiwanese who emigrated out of Taiwan, most of whom went to
the United States.</P>
      <P>As shown  from  a report  released  last  month  by  the Washington-based
Migration Policy Institute (MPI) , 76 percent of adult Taiwanese immigrants in
the United States own their own homes, and 72 percent hold bachelor's degree or
higher. This demonstrates that the group of people who moved out of Taiwan were
the elite of society.</P>
      <P>The MPI report also found that the wave of immigration from Taiwan to the United
States began in the 1960s and peaked in the 1980s, slowing down in the 1990s
after Taiwan's democratization. So it's evident that changes in Taiwan's
domestic political situation have been an important factor in influencing
people's intentions to migrate.</P>
      <P>While over 20 percent of Taiwanese would like to leave, most of those who stay
will not benefit from the government's main policy approach of liberalizing
cross-Taiwan Strait trade. They will be resigned to becoming part of the sinking
middle class and suffer from worsening unemployment.</P>
      <P>If the government still does not review its erroneous policy, it will become
obvious why Taiwan got a potential net migration index score of -21 percent.

      <P>A Little League team from Kaohsiung overwhelmed Canada 23-0 on Monday U.S. time
to move within one win of reaching the International Championship game at the
2010 Little League World Series in Williamsport, Pennsylvania.</P>
      <P>The Fu-Hsing Little League team from Taiwan coasted to victory behind a potent
attack that pounded out 15 hits and drew 10 walks and near flawless pitching
that yielded only one hit and one walk in the four-inning contest.</P>
      <P>The regulation six-inning game was called early because of the 10-run rule.</P>
      <P>It was the Taiwanese team's second consecutive shutout win in Pool D, after
defeating a team from Saudi Arabia 18-0 on Saturday U.S. time.</P>
      <P>It will next play the winner of the elimination game between Canada and the
Latin American champion from Panama, tentatively set for Wednesday U.S. time.</P>
      <P>Because this year's Little League World Series is using a double-elimination
format for each pool, Taiwan's team could lose Wednesday's game but still win
its pool with a victory against the same team in a rematch a day later.</P>
      <P>If the Fu-hsing Little League team succeeds in winning Pool D, it will play the
winner of Pool C -- comprised of the champions from the Caribbean,  Japan,
Mexico and Europe -- for the international championship.</P>
      <P>Taiwan would likely play Japan, which has already secured two wins in Pool C and
only needs to win one of two games against Mexico to advance.</P>
      <P>The winner of the international championship will vie with the U.S. champion for
the World Series title early Aug. 30 Taiwan time.</P>
      <P>According to team leader Lee Su-chen, the players' good form and high morale
suggest that they should have no problem winning Pool D, and the coaching staff
has set its sights on a potential encounter with perennial rival Japan.</P>
      <P>The last time a team from Taiwan won the Little League World Series was in 1996.</P>
      <P>Taiwan was long a powerhouse at the annual tournament, winning 17 titles between
1969 and 1996, but it has had a dry spell since then, with this year's club from
Kaohsiung only the fourth from Taiwan to even qualify for the World Series in
the past 14 years.</P>
      <P>Last year's team from Taoyuan rekindled local fans' interest in the tournament
by reaching the World Series championship game before falling to a team from
California.</P>

      <P>The Yi Tzy Folk Dance Theatre from Tainan in southern Taiwan has captivated
audiences in France and Italy over the past month with innovative dances imbued
with Taiwanese cultural flavors.</P>
      <P>The troupe, composed of 17 dancers and eight musicians, has traveled 7,000
kilometers between France and Italy since July 12 to perform in six
international arts festivals in various French and Italian cities.</P>
      <P>Yu Hao-yen, a noted choreographer who accompanied the troupe on its tour, said
Yi Tzy dances blend special Taiwanese temple festival cultural elements with
creative choreography that reflect youthful exuberance and Taiwanese folk
culture.</P>
      <P>On a limited budget, the group had to travel mainly by bus. The performers
sometimes took 22-hour bus rides to reach the performance venues.</P>
      <P>"Such long-haul travel was tiring, but the audience response was rewarding," Yu
said.</P>
      <P>Posters of the arts festival in the southern French city of Rouergue featured
the Yi Tzy troupe's publicity  photos,  and organizers of the dance festival in
the Italian city of Alatri arranged a flag-raising ceremony in which the
Republic of China's national flag was hoisted as its national anthem was sung,
Yu said.</P>
      <P>Troupe leader Chou Ling-chuan said troupe members were often moved to tears by
the passionate response of audiences.</P>
      <P>"Many of them often exclaimed 'Taiwan's awesome' at the end of our
performances," Chou recalled.</P>
      <P>She said that although the month-long performance tour was energy consuming, it
offered invaluable opportunities for troupe members to learn from their foreign
peers.</P>
      <P>"It was impressive and rewarding to collaborate with members of foreign troupes
in presenting opening and closing shows at the behest of festival organizers,"
she added.</P>
      <P>Michel Lu, Taiwan's representative to France, hosted a dinner in honor of the Yi
Tzy troupe members Monday, praising them for helping elevate Taiwan's
international  profile and promoting  cultural exchanges.</P>
      <P>The troupe is scheduled to depart for home Aug. 24.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>In response to Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin's call for civil servants to be given a
pay raise, Premier Wu Den-yih at first said the government could not afford to
do that because of its tight budget. Wu later softened his stance, saying the
proposed increases will depend whether there is enough tax revenue.</P>
      <P>Over the last 15 years, Taiwan's gross domestic product has risen by 4.39
percent on average, but there has been little increase in the real earnings of
workers. Civil servants have not had a pay raise in the last six years.</P>
      <P>Under these circumstances, private-sector workers are hoping that if civil
servants are give a pay increase, it will prompt their employers to follow suit.</P>
      <P>It is unacceptable for the government to use "inadequate tax revenue" as a
reason to postpone a pay hike for civil servants, because lower revenue has
resulted precisely from a series of tax reductions by the government.</P>
      <P>The administration of President Ma Ying-jeou of course gained favor among
corporations when it reduced their gift, estate and corporate income taxes.
However, by ignoring the hope of workers and civil servants for a pay hike, the
government has probably offended all salary earners.</P>
      <P>The government must carefully analyze and calculate what to do with its revenue
and expenditure. It should not wait until election time to pay attention to the
seriousness of the situation and realize that it is in deep trouble. (Editorial

    <HEADLINE>MOEA to issue guarantee letter for AUO executives</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  24 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) will issue a second guarantee letter to
a U.S. court in an attempt to persuade it to allow three present and former
executives from flat-panel maker AU Optronics Corp. to leave the United States,
a senior MOEA official said Monday.</P>
      <P>The three executives -- AUO CEO Chen Lai-juh, AUO Vice Chairman Chen Hsuan-bin
and former AUO Executive Vice President Hsiang Hui -- were barred from traveling
outside the continent by the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of
California on Aug. 19.</P>
      <P>Hsiang is now president and CEO of ODM services provider Qisda Corp., which
along with AUO is also a member of the BenQ group.</P>
      <P>The three had traveled to the U.S. to plea their cases after being indicted in
June on charges of participating in a conspiracy to fix the prices of TFT-LCD
panels with other Asian manufacturers between September 2001 and December 2006.</P>
      <P>Woody T.J. Duh, the director-general of the MOEA's Industrial Development
Bureau, said he will write the letter on behalf of the government guaranteeing
that the executives would appear at future court hearings.</P>
      <P>He said he will argue that because AUO is a listed company, if the executives
are not allowed to return to Taiwan and run the company, market order could be
affected.</P>
      <P>Duh will also contend that any disruption in AUO's operations due to the court
order is likely to impact global flat panel supply since the company is one of
the world's largest flat panel producers.</P>
      <P>He said Taiwan and the U.S. already have a mechanism for mutual judicial
assistance, and Taiwan's government can provide assurances that the three AUO
executives will not go into hiding and will appear in court as requested if they
are allowed to return to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"I think the government's guarantee will be helpful to some extent," Duh said.</P>
      <P>Duh said the first letter of guarantee the three AUO executives brought to the
court was issued by the government two weeks ago, but a change in the judge
hearing the case and a prosecutor appeal led to the court order barring the
three from leaving the U.S.</P>
      <P>The court acted at the request of prosecutors, who said the three men were
flight risks since they live and work in Taiwan, which has no extradition
agreement with the U.S.</P>
      <P>AUO has been one of many Asian flat panel makers indicted in the price fixing
case, but it has insisted on its innocence and refused to plead guilty.</P>
      <P>Pressure on AUO has mounted because seven other companies have already  pleaded
guilty to the price-fixing  charges  in the industrywide probe and nine
executives have received jail terms, according to prosecutors.</P>

      <P>The Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) is set to review the basic wage in mid-
September after a two-year freeze, CLA Minister Wang Ju-hsuan said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The basic wage level will be decided by a CLA review committee composed of 21
representatives -- seven each from management and the labor sector, four
academics and three government representatives, he said</P>
      <P>The CLA was scheduled to hold a meeting in July to discuss the minimum wage, but
had to wait for the Executive Yuan to approve a new set of screening
regulations.</P>
      <P>The delay angered labor rights groups, which accused the CLA of deliberately
attempting to postpone the review process.</P>
      <P>The CLA later decided  to increase  the number  of labor representatives on the
panel from four to seven and reduce the number of government representatives
from eight to three.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's basic wage stood at NT$15,840 in 1997 and was raised to NT$17,280 in
2007, covering some 1 million workers.</P>
      <P>Wang said the recent decision by the Executive Yuan not to raise civil servants'
pay next year is a different issue from that of the minimum wage and that the
CLA committee will make a decision in line with public expectations.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan researchers create pen-size plasma sterilization device</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Aug.  24  (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Local researchers have achieved a breakthrough by succeeding in developing and
producing a pen-size device capable of sterilizing instruments and wounds, even
in hard-to-reach  places,  that could have widespread medical and preventive
uses in the future.</P>
      <P>The handy device, introduced Monday by National Cheng Kung University (NCKU) in
Tainan, can eliminate common bacteria such as e. coli, staphylococcus aureus and
thermophilic bacilli within 90-120 seconds, the university said.</P>
      <P>Liao Jiunn-der, a professor in NCKU's Department of Materials Science and
Engineering who led the team that developed the device, envisions it as a key
part of people's first-aid kits because it can be operated at room temperature,
is non-toxic and works quickly, unlike more conventional sterilization systems
in use today.</P>
      <P>Its ability to sterilize all surfaces, including awkwardly located wounds or
parts of instruments that are hard to reach, Liao said, make it ideal for oral
cavity disinfection, surgical instrument sterilization and wound treatment.</P>
      <P>The pen relies on plasma sterilization, a process in which an ionized gas with
UV photons and radicals is released near the area requiring sterilization. The
photons and radicals then react with and "blow up" atoms that the bacteria need
to survive, the professor explained.</P>
      <P>Before miniaturizing the system from a machine into a pen-size device,
researchers first determined optimal sterilization parameters for the micro-
plasma jet system they developed.</P>
      <P>Liao said the team's goal is for the new "micro-plasma" device to replace laser
machines, which cost in the neighborhood of NT$4 million to NT$5 million.</P>
      <P>The plasma sterilization pen, he said, costs only about one-tenth as much and is
more effective than a laser.</P>
      <P>The research team has begun cooperating with the university hospital to conduct
clinical trials using the device to disinfect oral cavities, according to NCKU.</P>
      <P>The development of plasma medicine began in the United States and Germany in
2009.</P>

      <P>Taiwan share prices closed down 0.44 percent Tuesday on profit-taking following
gains made in the previous session, but selling was limited as rises in China's
markets encouraged some buying momentum, dealers said.</P>
      <P>The weighted index closed down 35.29 points at the day's low of 7,940.64, off a
high of 7,990.49, on turnover of NT$130.85 billion (US$4.10 billion).</P>
      <P>The market opened up 7.69 points on follow-through buying, but pressure emerged
immediately as investors sought to lock in recent gains because of weakness on
Wall Street overnight, dealers said.</P>
      <P>A total of 1,360 stocks closed up, 2,338 finished lower, and 274 remained
unchanged.</P>
      <P>Textile sector shares suffered the heaviest losses, down 1.1 percent. Foodstuffs
and construction stocks fell 0.8 percent, and the machinery and electronics
sector dropped 0.5 percent.</P>
      <P>The financial, and plastics and chemical sectors closed down 0.2 percent each,
while cement stocks gained 0.1 percent and paper and pulp stocks rose 1.0
percent.</P>
      <P>Grand Cathay Securities analyst Mars Hsu said the gains posted by Shanghai's
market Tuesday boosted investors' faith in China's fast-growing economy.</P>
      <P>"Investors have high hopes that the strong demand from China's market will
offset the impact of a slower pace of economic recovery in the United States and
Europe, " he said.</P>
      <P>Hsu said rising Chinese stocks also gave the local bourse some resilience
against recent Wall Street weakness. The local market has been caught in a tug-
of-war between concerns over U.S. markets and relief provided by Chinese demand.</P>
      <P>"Because strong technical pressure ahead of the 8,000 point mark remains, it has
not been easy for the index to jump over the barrier," Hsu said.</P>
      <P>The index once challenged the key level Monday but failed, closing below 8,000
points, although it recorded gains on active rotational buying.</P>
      <P>"But buying has rotated too quickly, meaning the market has been moving without
a mainstream sector strong enough to create a breakthrough, " Hsu said.</P>
      <P>He said consolidation is expected to continue to dominate trade in the local
bourse.</P>
      <P>In the transportation sector, China Airlines fell 3.07 percent to NT$20.55,
while Evergreen Marine rose 0.22 percent to NT$23.05.</P>
      <P>Among other old economy stocks, Taiwan Cement lost 0.33 percent to NT$30.00 and
China Steel closed down 0.49 percent at NT$30.45.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. fell 0.83 percent to NT$59.60 and IC
designer MediaTek closed down 0.22 percent at NT$447.00.</P>

      <P>Seventeen companies were awarded the 2010 Taiwan Superior Brand title on
Tuesday, which means they will receive government assistance to boost their
brands and expand their markets overseas.</P>
      <P>The award winners this year, selected from 70 candidates, were judged based on
their financial standing, branding achievement, brand establishment, branding
strategies and competitive advantage.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Superior Brands Award was designed by the Bureau of Foreign Trade
(BOFT) to identify outstanding domestic companies with brand earnings of more
than 20 percent of their overall revenue or more than NT$1 billion (US$31
million) per year.</P>
      <P>This year was the first time that the candidates were asked to meet the brand
earnings requirements. Last year, the competitors had to prove that at least 30
percent of their revenue came from exports.</P>
      <P>At the award ceremony, Huang Chih-peng, director-general of the BOFT, said that
Taiwan needs to develop its own brands so that its products will be able to
reach international markets.</P>
      <P>"We need to have quality products, as well as own brands, to expand our
markets," he said.</P>
      <P>To this end, the government is seeking to sign trade pacts with other countries
in the wake of its economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) with China,
he said.</P>
      <P>Wang Chih-kang, chairman of the Taiwan External Trade Development Council
(TAITRA) which implemented the awards, said that the council will hold a total
of 20 trade fairs in China by the end of 2013 and will promote Taiwanese brands
at 20 shopping malls or street stands there.</P>
      <P>The brand awards were presented in eight different categories -- information,
communication and home appliances;  machinery and hardware; sports and leisure;
healthcare and biotechnology; fashion; cultural and creative industries; green
energy; high-end agriculture; and other industries.</P>
      <P>Five companies won the awards in the category of information, communication and
home appliances. They were electronic dictionary maker Inventec Besta, CHIMEI,
KVM switch solution provider ATEN International, switching power supply
manufacturer Mean Well, and LCD multi-media display manufacturer Heran.</P>
      <P>Sanitary ware manufacturer  HCG and Delta Electronics were selected as superior
brands in the green energy category, while Black Bridge Food and Jiu Zhen Nan
Taiwan Pastry won the awards in the category of high-end agriculture.</P>
      <P>Porcelain maker Franz Collection and band instrument maker JUPITER were chosen
as the winners in the categories of cultural and creative industries, and sports
and leisure, respectively.</P>
      <P>The online shopping website Pay Easy, cord blood private banking service BIONET,
and MedFirst Healthcare Services were also among the winners.</P>

      <P>Minister of Health Yaung Chih-liang pleaded Tuesday with reporters to let him
be, as he tried to knock back rumors that he was planning to resign because his
proposals for national health insurance (NHI) reform were sidelined again by the
legislature.</P>
      <P>The package of legal amendments proposed by the Cabinet-level Department of
Health (DOH) to resuscitate the debt-laden national health insurance (NHI)
system failed to clear the floor of the Legislative Yuan during an extra session
that ended Monday.</P>
      <P>The legislature has set a Dec. 7 deadline for completing the processing of the
bill, which would pave the way for NHI reform, Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang
Jin-pyng said Monday.</P>
      <P>However, Yaung told reporters Monday that he thinks the DOH would need new
leadership to carry out the reform after the amendments clear the legislature.</P>
      <P>He further said that if the legislature continues to shelve the bill, it would
be an indication that he was not doing a good job and someone else should take
over.</P>
      <P>When asked Tuesday whether Yaung planned to resign, Wang said there was no need
for that because the legislature has already worked out a timetable for the
processing of the NHI reform package.</P>
      <P>Legislators are still divided on some articles of the bill and should therefore
be given more time to iron out their differences, he said</P>
      <P>The controversial sections of the bill mainly have to do with premium rates, he
said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Premier Wu Den-yih said he trusts Yaung and believes the minister
will do his best to have the NHI reform package passed in the legislature.</P>
      <P>Wu did not respond directly to reporters' questions on whether or not Yaung will
remain in his post.</P>
      <P>Earlier this year, Yaung offered to resign after the legislature failed to pass
the NHI reform bill and said he would quit if lawmakers continued to shelve the

      <P>Kaohsiung's Liuho Night Market and Taipei's Shilin Night Market maintained their
positions as Taiwan's most gorgeous night markets in the final stage of a "most
special night market" competition, the Tourism Bureau said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Liuho won all six categories in the contest based on an online poll completed
Aug. 15, but a panel of seven judges, whose opinions accounted for 60 percent of
the final scores, distributed their votes among several markets.</P>
      <P>The panel also named Liuho the most popular market.</P>
      <P>Shilin, which was in second place for all six categories in the online poll,
tied with Liuho for most gorgeous in the final rankings. Keelung's Miaokou Night
Market and Luodong Night Market in Yilan emerged as the most visitor-friendly,
while Miaokou and Fengchia Night Market in Taichung City were selected as the
best for food. Taipei's Huaxi Street Night Market, also known as Snake Alley,
was named the easiest to shop at.</P>
      <P>Markets named most gorgeous, most visitor-friendly, best for food tastes and
easiest to shop at received NT$100,000 each. Liuho received an additional
NT$50,000 for winning in the most popular category.</P>
      <P>The team of judges consisted of experts in cultural circles, the food  industry,
foreigners  living  in Taiwan,  bloggers  and representatives from the bureau.
Although they had also been tasked with selecting the most environmentally
friendly market in the country, no market was selected because none of them were
up to standards, according to a bureau official.</P>
      <P>The judges also recommended Chiayi City's Wenhua Road Night Market as the most
unique old night market, Taipei Ningxia Night Market as the one with the most
innovative marketing strategy, Tainan Garden Night Market as the most modern and
Chunghua Road Night Market in Kaohsiung County's Fengshan as the most
neighborhood-friendly.</P>
      <P>At a function to unveil the results, President Ma Ying-jeou described Taiwan's
night markets as a good representation of the country's grassroots culture and
said the government has taken the food industry as an emerging service industry
for prioritized promotion at home and abroad.</P>
      <P>Ma said that night markets play a major role in driving Taiwan's tourism
industry and help greatly in promoting  Taiwan's food internationally.</P>
      <P>Ma said that Taiwan has seen a boom in tourism since he took office in 2008 and
that the country has 658 newly built or revamped hotels. He also said there were
plans to invest NT$50 billion to build another 31 hotels and create more than
7,000 jobs. The number of foreign visitors is expected to reach 5.2 million this
year, he added.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou nominated Rai Hau-min, currently chairman of the Central
Election Commission (CEC), as a justice on the Constitutional Court and
president of the Judicial Yuan Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Su Yeong-chin, a law professor at National Chengchi University, was also
nominated as a grand justice who would serve as vice president of the Judicial
Yuan, Ma announced at a news conference.</P>
      <P>Ma said he was confident that Rai and Su's personal integrity will help restore
public faith in the judiciary.</P>
      <P>The nominations are pending consent by the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>The positions of Judicial Yuan president and vice president were left vacant by
Lai In-jaw and Hsieh Tsay-chuan, respectively, who resigned in July to take
responsibility for a scandal in which three senior judges were detained for
alleged corruption.</P>
      <P>According to the Constitution, the president and vice president of the Judicial
Yuan have to be appointed by the president of the country from among 15 justices
of the Constitutional Court and confirmed by the legislature.</P>
      <P>Justices serve eight-year terms,  but their terms are not synchronized.</P>
      <P>Legislative Yuan speaker Wang Jin-pyng said later that day that legislators will
review the nominations after the next regular legislative session opens in
September.</P>
      <P>Wang said Lai and Hsieh, who have continued to serve as justices on the
Constitutional Court after stepping down from the Judicial Yuan leadership
positions, will resign from the justice posts soon.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the nominations, Lin Hung-chih -- a whip of the ruling Kuomintang
(KMT) caucus, which holds a two-thirds majority in the legislature -- said Rai
and Su are suitable candidates who enjoy high prestige in the legal sector.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Hsieh Kuo-liang, however, said that with Rai assuming the CEC
chairmanship for less than a year, his new nomination could be challenged in the
legislature.</P>
      <P>Rai must also be able to present clear ideas regarding judicial reforms in order
to win legislators' support, Hsieh Kuo-liang said.</P>
      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive  Party (DPP)  caucus, meanwhile, said it
will vote against the nominations because they are "unacceptable."</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Gao Jyh-peng said Rai's qualifications  are questionable as he
has never had a job related to the judiciary or judicial reforms. He said Rai's
nomination is intended to draw attention away from Su, who is a former high
school and university classmate of Ma.</P>

      <P>China Airlines (CAL) , Yang Ming Marine Transport Corp. and Wan Hai Lines said
Tuesday they had decided to divest themselves of their stakes in Yangtze River
Express Airlines, a China-based cargo carrier.</P>
      <P>CAL, Taiwan's largest international carrier, will sell the 25 percent stake it
owns in Yangtze River Express for 312.5 million Chinese yuan (US$46 million)
back to Hainan Air Group, while Yang Ming Marine will dump its 12 percent stake,
worth 150 million yuan, and Wan Hai will dispose of a 6 percent stake for 75
million yuan, also to Hainan Air.</P>
      <P>The three companies bought Yangtze River Express stakes in 2005 with CAL
becoming the largest foreign shareholder.</P>
      <P>"The investment at the time was aimed at being a strategic alliance tapping the
huge Chinese market in 2005, when no direct air links had been set up across the
Taiwan Strait, " CAL spokesman Hamilton Liu said.</P>
      <P>"But now things have changed as cross-Taiwan Strait business ties are getting
closer than ever with direct flights having been launched. We have decided to
divest our investment, looking for new business opportunities," Liu said.</P>
      <P>Liu said that for CAL, its divestment will be carried out in phases over the
next two or three years.</P>
      <P>Yang Ming Marine and Wan Hai said they will hold talks with Hainan Air on
further details of their divestments.</P>
      <P>Local media said the divestment decision was made because the Chinese carrier
has incurred large losses after soaring international fuel prices in 2007 and
2008 and the global financial meltdown in 2009.</P>
      <P>However, Liu said the financial condition of Yangtze River Express has recently
been improving.</P>
      <P>"Although CAL will sell its stake, business ties with Yangtze River Express will
not be cut completely, " Liu said, adding that CAL still leases two planes to
the Chinese carrier, while training programs for its crew members are also
provided by CAL.</P>
      <P>Yangtze River Express, which was established in 2002, owns a fleet of 12 planes,
operating domestic cargo flights and serving destinations in the United States
and Europe.</P>

      <P>China's second-highest-ranking envoy to Taiwan met farmers in southern Taiwan's
Tainan County on Monday to promote the direct sale of locally grown agricultural
products to China.</P>
      <P>Zheng Lizhong, deputy chairman of the Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Straits (ARATS) , reportedly said that his trip to Tainan is aimed at
gaining a first-hand understanding of Taiwanese farmers' ideas in the wake of
the economic cooperation framework agreement signed between Taiwan and China in
June.</P>
      <P>The ARATS is a semi-official negotiating body authorized by Beijing to handle
cross-Taiwan Strait affairs in the absence of official links between the two
sides.</P>
      <P>In an attempt to keep his visit to Tainan low key, Zheng refused to answer
reporters' questions or provide news releases.</P>
      <P>Local media sources, however, cited Zheng as saying he is visiting Taiwan in his
capacity as deputy director of the Central Office for Taiwan Affairs of the
Communist Party of China.</P>
      <P>Zheng was also quoted as saying that during his current trip, which will last
until the end of this month, he hopes to gain a better understanding of what
types of agricultural products or fruit China can directly place orders for and
the difficulties local farmers face in selling their products to China directly.</P>
      <P>According to the reports, Zheng also said he will communicate with various
Chinese government agencies over the matter after he returns to China.</P>
      <P>He also suggested that farmers set up agricultural cooperatives, product
production and sales units or companies to directly sell their products to China
and save themselves from being exploited by middlemen, the reports said.</P>
      <P>In light of brisk sales of Taiwan's milkfish in Shenzhen in southern China's
Guangdong Province, the inspection of milkfish production and sales is also be a
major part of his trip to Tainan, the reports said.</P>
      <P>Zheng was at the head of an eight-member delegation that was mainly composed of
Chinese officials responsible for Taiwan affairs.</P>

      <P>Flat panel maker Chimei Innolux Corp. said Tuesday it has filed additional
lawsuits against Japanese electronics giant Sony in the United States and China
for alleged patent infringement.</P>
      <P>In a statement, Chimei Innolux said it had filed lawsuits against Sony with the
Delaware Federal District Court of the U.S. and with courts in China's Beijing,
Chengdu, Xian and Ningbo.</P>
      <P>The Taiwanese firm said it has also filed a complaint against Sony with the U.S.
International Trade Commission.</P>
      <P>In the lawsuits, Chimei Innolux said, it accused Sony of infringing its patents
when producing its gaming consoles, flat panel TVs, digital cameras and notebook
computers.</P>
      <P>In July, the Taiwanese firm sued Sony in the U.S. and China -- also for patent
infringement involving production of flat panel TVs and digital cameras.</P>
      <P>"For the latest  lawsuits,  we have found  Sony's  patent infringement extended
to gaming consoles and notebook computer manufacturing, " a Chimei Innolux
spokeswoman told the Central News Agency.</P>
      <P>"Apart from seeking damages, we have asked the courts to bar Sony from selling
its products to the U.S. and China, " the spokeswoman said.</P>
      <P>In the statement, Peterson Tien, Chimei Innolux general counsel, said the
company has shown great respect for intellectual property rights (IPR).</P>
      <P>As the company has devoted itself to research and development, "once it finds
its IPR violated, Chimei Innolux will try its best to protect those rights,"
Tien said.</P>

      <P>A wildlife rescue center in southern Taiwan has achieved success in helping
abandoned aged tigers rehabilitate their animal instincts by giving them fitness
training the center's director told CNA Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The Pingtung Rescue Center has been giving tigers, bears, orangutans and other
wildlife training courses, such as hiding food in a toy or on a pole, said Pei
Chia-chi, the director of the center.</P>
      <P>In the case of the tigers, the keepers normally place their meat two meters
above the ground on a feeding pole so that the animals have to jump to get their
food.</P>
      <P>One of them initially failed to reach the meat because of weakness in her
hindquarters, but the 15-year-old tiger can now jump up to three meters and
climb up the pole to grab the meat after receiving training twice a day for the
last six months.</P>
      <P>Pei said the average lifespan of a tiger in captivity is 15-20 years, but added
that the center expects the tigers there to live for 25 years thanks to the
regular training.</P>
      <P>In addition to the tigers, the keepers also stimulate the sun bears at the
center by stuffing food into their toys and hiding them in their cages so that
the bears have to actually hunt for their toys and food.</P>
      <P>In the case of the orangutans, the food is placed in rotating baskets hanging
from a mini-Ferris wheel. In order to sample every type of food, the orangutans
have to turn the wheels, which provides them with exercise.</P>
      <P>According to the rescue center, the training has improved the health of the
animals and has helped the center to save on previously huge medical expenses.</P>
      <P>The center currently cares for more than 800 animals rescued from circuses and
private zoos around the country. About 20 animals are sent to the center every
month.</P>

      <P>The LPGA Tour will come to Taiwan for the first time in 2011, giving local golf
fans a rare opportunity to see the world's leading female golfers, including
home favorite Tseng Yani, in person, an official announced Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Taoyuan County Magistrate Wu Chih-yang said the LPGA (Ladies Professional Golf
Association) tournament will take place in October 2011 at the Sunrise Golf
&amp; Country Club in Yangmei.</P>
      <P>"The contest will help promote Taiwan in the global sports community and provide
opportunities for local residents to watch a high-level competition in person,"
he said.</P>
      <P>The North America-based tour is scheduled to hold five events in Asia in 2010
(in Thailand and Singapore in February and in Malaysia, South Korea and Japan in
October and November), and Taiwan's addition could make it six in 2011.</P>
      <P>Hsu Tien-ya, chairman of the Golf Association of the Republic of China, said the
event was formally confirmed by the LPGA on Aug. 12, and it will offer prize
money of US$2 million, one of the highest offered on tour.</P>
      <P>"I believe that more than 80 players of the world's top 100 will participate,
including 8 of the top 10, " said Hsu, who added that Taiwan signed a deal to
host an LPGA event for three years.</P>
      <P>The biggest draw is expected to be Taiwan's Tseng Yani, currently ranked fifth
in the world and winner of two of this year's four major championships.</P>
      <P>Tseng will have a potential home course advantage because she spent a lot of

    <HEADLINE>EPA drafting regulations on waste from optronics factories</HEADLINE>

(By Lin Szu-yu and Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) said Tuesday it is drafting a
set of standards to manage waste produced by the optronics industry.</P>
      <P>The regulations will cover levels of biological toxicity and levels of rare
metals such as gallium, indium, and molybdenum in the effluent from optronics
factories, the EPA said in press statement.</P>
      <P>Gallium is used in the manufacture of light-emitting diodes (LEDs), indium is
used in wires for semi-conductors, and molybdenum in transistors.</P>
      <P>The EPA decided to work on the regulations after a court earlier this month
rejected an environmental impact assessment for a project by the Central Taiwan
Science Park.</P>
      <P>The court's ruling was based mainly on the absence of regulations on effluent
from hi-tech industries that were to be located in the planned Erlin Science
Park.</P>
      <P>The EPA said it will draft waste disposal standards specifically for the
optronics industry before September and will publish them for public input
before finalizing them.</P>
      <P>They will be the first guidelines in the world on the levels of gallium, indium
and molybdenum in factory effluent, the EPA said, noting that the effect of
these metals on humans and the environment is not clear.</P>
      <P>However, the administration said the standards will include biological risks, in
an effort to push factories to reduce their level of waste by improving the
manufacturing process.</P>
      <P>Based on the proposals so far, about 20 percent of optronics manufacturers will
have to reduce their levels of biological acute toxicity, the EPA said.</P>
      <P>They can do this by using less chemicals during the manufacturing process and
tightening control of waste solvents to prevent them from entering waste water,
among other measures, it suggested.</P>
      <P>Companies will be given a reasonable period of time to improve their
manufacturing process before the standards are implemented, the EPA said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the EPA said, it will continue to monitor the contents of waste from
the hi-tech industry, record the main pollutants and update standards as the
sector grows.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taipei reports first indigenous dengue fever case in two years</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taipei City Department of Health on Tuesday announced the first reported
case of indigenous dengue fever in the city for two years.</P>
      <P>According to the department, a 54-year-old man living in Beitou district was
confirmed to have the disease on Aug. 22. He is now in recovery at home,
department officials said.</P>
      <P>The department does not yet know how the patient, who has not recently traveled
out of the country or even Taipei City, was infected with the mosquito-born
disease, the officials added.</P>
      <P>The department said measures have been taken to prevent an outbreak after it
received a report of the infection on Aug. 21.</P>
      <P>So far this year, 31 cases of confirmed dengue fever infection were reported in
Taipei City, 30 of which were determined to be imported cases, the department
said.</P>
      <P>Citing data from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) under the Department of
Health, the officials said dengue fever cases in Taiwan occurred earlier than
usual this year due to global warming that led to a suitable climate for
mosquito breeding.</P>
      <P>According to CDC statistics, the number of recorded indigenous dengue fever
cases in the country has risen to 30 since March, mostly in Taiwan's southern
areas of Kaohsiung and Tainan.</P>
      <P>CDC Deputy Director-General Chou Chih-hao warned that as 18 of the cases were
reported last week, it appeared that the outbreak was accelerating.</P>
      <P>Recently, temperatures in Taiwan have hovered around 25-30 Celsius degrees. With
afternoon showers common in the summer, it is easy for the mosquitoes that can
spread dengue fever to reproduce if people allow stagnant water to remain in
containers, Chou said.</P>
      <P>"Weekly cleaning is necessary to control the outbreak," he noted.</P>
      <P>Dengue fever causes a severe flu-like illness and sometimes leads to a
potentially fatal complication called dengue hemorrhagic fever.</P>
      <P>The last case of indigenous dengue fever in Taipei City was reported in the
summer of 2008.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Matsu to boost tourism to prevent marginalization</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's outlying Matsu Island group is launching a drive to attract more
foreign tourists in the hope that a local tourism boost can prevent
marginalization amid the warmer ties between Taiwan and China, a local tourism
official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>"If Matsu does not try to leverage its geographic advantages, its economy will
be marginalized as cross-strait direct flights are now running at full steam, "
said Tsao Erh-yuen, director of the Tourism Bureau of the Lianjiang county
government, on the sidelines of a press conference to announce a three-day
tourism promotional tour.</P>
      <P>Matsu, an archipelago in the Taiwan Strait lying 190 km from Taiwan's Keelung
and 19 km from the Chinese coast, is administered by Taiwan as a part of
Lianjiang County. The other part of the county is in China and has been under
the control of the People's Republic of China since 1949.</P>
      <P>Matsu, which is located off the coast of eastern Fujian Province, and Kinmen,
another Taiwan-controlled outlying island which is near China's Xiamen, were at
the forefront of the cross-strait conflict and remained under the war-zone civil
administration until 1992, five years after the lifting of martial law in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to Tsao, the local economy received a boost in 2001 after the
implementation of the "mini three links" that allow limited postal, transport
and trade links between several Chinese cities and Kinmen and Matsu.</P>
      <P>However, he added, since links allowing direct flights, shipping and postal
between Taiwan proper and China were fully implemented in 2008, Matsu has become
merely a "stopover" en route to Taiwan for Chinese tourists.</P>
      <P>"Generally speaking, our local tourism really needs a shot in the arm, " he
said. According to Tsao's bureau, total tourist arrivals to Matsu were around
20,000 in 2004, increasing to more than 80,000 in 2009. Kinmen attracts far more
travelers than Matsu by a 5:1 ratio.</P>
      <P>For this reason, Matsu, which is known for its liquor production, traditional
Fujianese  architecture  and military  tunnels and fortresses, intends to do
everything it can to attract more foreign tourists, who account for less than 10
percent of its annual visitors, said Lianjiang Magistrate Yang Sui-sheng.</P>
      <P>The tour will include three female Russian students studying at Kainan
University in northern Taiwan's Taoyuan County. Alexandria Zakhazova, 22, her 20
-year-old sister Daria and Maria Kravchenko, 18, will get first-hand experience
of the archipelago, along with 12 foreign reporters.</P>
      <P>"We came to Taiwan to study because this is a place where you can see multiple
influences, including those from Japan, the United States and China. I think
it's going to be an exciting experience to learn about a new place. And we would
love to visit as many places as possibly can during our stay in Taiwan, " said
Alexandra Zakhazova.</P>
      <P>The girls appeared at the press conference dressed in Republic of China army
uniform a day before their departure for Matsu, an area of less than 30 square
kilometers that at one point was home to a garrison of more than 50,000 troops.
The number of soldiers stationed there is now down to around 2,000.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Nobel economics laureate Elinor Ostrom said Tuesday in Taipei that there is no
need to wait for a global solution to tackle global warming and that local and
regional actions are just as necessary as policies made at international and
national levels.</P>
      <P>"Instead of one global remedy, we need to apply polycentric theory  to  develop
a  notion  of  complex,  multi-level political-economic-social systems to cope
with complex, multi-level (ecological) problems, " Ostrom said in a public
presentation on climate change.</P>
      <P>"My basic argument is that if we are going to solve global problems and get
better global governance, local must be involved, " the 2009 winner added.</P>
      <P>Ostrom said the Sacramento Municipal Utility District, a provider of public
power to the Sacramento region in California, allowed households in the region
to see in their bills how much power their "efficient neighbors" saved the month
before.</P>
      <P>This method encouraged energy conservation by giving these households a desire
to keep up with their neighbors' good work, Ostrom noted.</P>
      <P>During the panel discussion, Christina Liu, the head of the Cabinet-level
Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) , said that the Taiwan
government launched a measure years ago that successfully reduced the use of
plastic bags.</P>
      <P>"When the measure was launched to require people to spend at least NT$1 to buy
plastic bags at local stores, many critics said that NT$1 would not stop people
from using the bags," she said.</P>
      <P>"However, we did see some results (of the measure) later on," Liu said. "People
now bring their own bags when going to stores."</P>
      <P>Liu added that the government will soon encourage 24-hour convenience stories to
conserve energy.</P>
      <P>"This is important because in Taiwan, local convenience stories account for 10
percent of the total electricity used," she noted.</P>
      <P>To offer another example on how Taiwan works to reduce global carbon emissions,
Environmental Protection Administration Minister Stephen Shen, another panelist,
said that Taiwan passed amendments last year to encourage local consumers to buy
energy-efficient home appliances and other products.</P>

      <P>The Yunlin county government launched a reforestation program Tuesday with a
plan to promote the formation of 2,600 hectares of forest in the central county,
which houses the Formosa Plastics Group's (FPG's) petrochemical complex.</P>
      <P>The plan was drawn up after FPG agreed to provide the same amount of money as
that put up by the county government as an incentive to encourage private
landowners to plant trees, said Lu Cheng-chang, chief of the county's Department
of Agriculture.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that the petrochemical complex, located in Mailiao township,
covers 2,600 hectares of land and emits 67 million tons of carbon dioxide (CO2)
each year. As each hectare of forest can only absorb 20 tons of CO2 a year, the
county would need to create forests spanning 3.38 million hectares to offset the
massive pollution levels caused by the FPG plant, Lu noted.</P>
      <P>With this in mind, the country government asked FPG to at least help the
formation of 2,600 hectares of forests within 20 years, to match the area of
land taken up by the petrochemical complex, Lu said.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the agreement, those who sign up for the reforestation
program are entitled to subsidies of up to NT$3.7 million (US$115,300) for each
hectare of forest they plant over a 20-year period.</P>

      <P>The traditional idea that a corpse should not be moved for eight hours following
death makes organ donations difficult in Taiwan, an advocate said at a news

      <P>Chang Shang-chun, chairman of the Taiwan Organ Registry and Sharing Center,
attributed problems with promoting organ donations to "conservative and
conventional" practices.</P>
      <P>Many Taiwanese believe that a corpse should not be moved for eight hours after a

      <P>Taiwan will donate US$1 million for relief and reconstruction in areas of China
hit hard by recent flooding that left more than 1,000 dead and hundreds missing,
the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) said Tuesday.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei-based China Airlines (CAL) announced Tuesday that from September for a
limited period, it will cut prices by at least 10 percent for individual
passengers flying economy class on routes between Taiwan and certain cities in
China.</P>
      <P>From Sept. 1-Dec. 31, passengers on CAL flights from Taiwan Taoyuan
International Airport and Taipei's Songshan Airport to China's Beijing,
Shanghai's Pudong and Hongqiao airports, Nanjing and Ningbo, as well as flights
between Kaohsiung and Pudong Airport, will enjoy the cheaper prices, the company
said.</P>
      <P>Under the program, the prices of one-year, three-month, one-month and 14-day
validity economy round-trip tickets on the routes will be cut, according to the
company.</P>
      <P>CAL said the biggest cut will be on one-year tickets for flights between Taipei
and Nanjing and between Taipei and Ningbo, at 27.3 percent. Group tickets will
not be entitled to the price cut.</P>
      <P>CAL Vice President Brian Chou, who is in charge of marketing affairs, said the
cuts are being initiated to celebrate the Aug. 31 first anniversary of the
launch of regular direct flights between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Each week,  28 round-trip flights will be subject to the discounted fares, Chou
said.</P>
      <P>Asked about the expected impact of the cuts on the company's revenues in the
fourth quarter, given the fact that 20 percent of the total CAL revenues are
generated from cross-strait services, Chou declined to make a detailed
assessment, saying only that "they will decline."</P>
      <P>Following  CAL's  announcement,  EVA  Airways,  Taiwan's second-largest carrier,
announced that it would follow suit on its cross-strait flights, as well as on
flights to elsewhere in Asia, Europe and America.</P>
      <P>Prices for individual economy class flights from Taoyuan and Kaohsiung to
Beijing, Shanghai, Ningbo and Nanjing will be cut by 10 percent to 15 percent,
while a price drop of between 5 percent and 15 percent will be implemented on
its global routes, according to the company.</P>
      <P>Taipei-based TransAsia Airways, which also operates cross-strait services, said
it would not decide whether or not to follow the price cuts until the following
day.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Matsu to boost tourism to prevent marginalization</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's outlying Matsu Island group is launching a drive to attract more
foreign tourists in the hope that a local tourism boost can prevent
marginalization amid the warmer ties between Taiwan and China, a local tourism
official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>"If Matsu does not try to leverage its geographic advantages, its economy will
be marginalized as cross-strait direct flights are now running at full steam, "
said Tsao Erh-yuen, director of the Tourism Bureau of the Lianjiang county
government, on the sidelines of a press conference to announce a three-day
tourism promotional tour.</P>
      <P>Matsu, an archipelago in the Taiwan Strait lying 190 km from Taiwan's Keelung
and 19 km from the Chinese coast, is administered by Taiwan as a part of
Lianjiang County. The other part of the county is in China and has been under
the control of the People's Republic of China since 1949.</P>
      <P>Matsu, which is located off the coast of eastern Fujian Province, and Kinmen,
another Taiwan-controlled outlying island which is near China's Xiamen, were at
the forefront of the cross-strait conflict and remained under the war-zone civil
administration until 1992, five years after the lifting of martial law in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to Tsao, the local economy received a boost in 2001 after the
implementation of the "mini three links" that allow limited postal, transport
and trade links between several Chinese cities and Kinmen and Matsu.</P>
      <P>However, he added, since links allowing direct flights, shipping and postal
between Taiwan proper and China were fully implemented in 2008, Matsu has become
merely a "stopover" en route to Taiwan for Chinese tourists.</P>
      <P>"Generally speaking, our local tourism really needs a shot in the arm, " he
said. According to Tsao's bureau, total tourist arrivals to Matsu were around
20,000 in 2004, increasing to more than 80,000 in 2009. Kinmen attracts far more
travelers than Matsu by a 5:1 ratio.</P>
      <P>For this reason, Matsu, which is known for its liquor production, traditional
Fujianese  architecture  and military  tunnels and fortresses, intends to do
everything it can to attract more foreign tourists, who account for less than 10
percent of its annual visitors, said Lianjiang Magistrate Yang Sui-sheng.</P>
      <P>The tour will include three female Russian students studying at Kainan
University in northern Taiwan's Taoyuan County. Alexandria Zakhazova, 22, her 20
-year-old sister Daria and Maria Kravchenko, 18, will get first-hand experience
of the archipelago, along with 12 foreign reporters.</P>
      <P>"We came to Taiwan to study because this is a place where you can see multiple
influences, including those from Japan, the United States and China. I think
it's going to be an exciting experience to learn about a new place. And we would
love to visit as many places as possibly can during our stay in Taiwan, " said
Alexandra Zakhazova.</P>
      <P>The girls appeared at the press conference dressed in Republic of China army
uniform a day before their departure for Matsu, an area of less than 30 square
kilometers that at one point was home to a garrison of more than 50,000 troops.
The number of soldiers stationed there is now down to around 2,000.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Visiting Nobel winner urges local action on global warming</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Nobel economics laureate Elinor Ostrom said Tuesday in Taipei that there is no
need to wait for a global solution to tackle global warming and that local and
regional actions are just as necessary as policies made at international and
national levels.</P>
      <P>"Instead of one global remedy, we need to apply polycentric theory  to  develop
a  notion  of  complex,  multi-level political-economic-social systems to cope
with complex, multi-level (ecological) problems, " Ostrom said in a public
presentation on climate change.</P>
      <P>"My basic argument is that if we are going to solve global problems and get
better global governance, local must be involved, " the 2009 winner added.</P>
      <P>Ostrom said the Sacramento Municipal Utility District, a provider of public
power to the Sacramento region in California, allowed households in the region
to see in their bills how much power their "efficient neighbors" saved the month
before.</P>
      <P>This method encouraged energy conservation by giving these households a desire
to keep up with their neighbors' good work, Ostrom noted.</P>
      <P>During the panel discussion, Christina Liu, the head of the Cabinet-level
Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) , said that the Taiwan
government launched a measure years ago that successfully reduced the use of
plastic bags.</P>
      <P>"When the measure was launched to require people to spend at least NT$1 to buy
plastic bags at local stores, many critics said that NT$1 would not stop people
from using the bags," she said.</P>
      <P>"However, we did see some results (of the measure) later on," Liu said. "People
now bring their own bags when going to stores."</P>
      <P>Liu added that the government will soon encourage 24-hour convenience stories to
conserve energy.</P>
      <P>"This is important because in Taiwan, local convenience stories account for 10
percent of the total electricity used," she noted.</P>
      <P>To offer another example on how Taiwan works to reduce global carbon emissions,
Environmental Protection Administration Minister Stephen Shen, another panelist,
said that Taiwan passed amendments last year to encourage local consumers to buy
energy-efficient home appliances and other products.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Yunlin county government launched a reforestation program Tuesday with a
plan to promote the formation of 2,600 hectares of forest in the central county,
which houses the Formosa Plastics Group's (FPG's) petrochemical complex.</P>
      <P>The plan was drawn up after FPG agreed to provide the same amount of money as
that put up by the county government as an incentive to encourage private
landowners to plant trees, said Lu Cheng-chang, chief of the county's Department
of Agriculture.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that the petrochemical complex, located in Mailiao township,
covers 2,600 hectares of land and emits 67 million tons of carbon dioxide (CO2)
each year. As each hectare of forest can only absorb 20 tons of CO2 a year, the
county would need to create forests spanning 3.38 million hectares to offset the
massive pollution levels caused by the FPG plant, Lu noted.</P>
      <P>With this in mind, the country government asked FPG to at least help the
formation of 2,600 hectares of forests within 20 years, to match the area of
land taken up by the petrochemical complex, Lu said.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the agreement, those who sign up for the reforestation
program are entitled to subsidies of up to NT$3.7 million (US$115,300) for each
hectare of forest they plant over a 20-year period.</P>

      <P>The traditional idea that a corpse should not be moved for eight hours following
death makes organ donations difficult in Taiwan, an advocate said at a news
conference in Taipei Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chang Shang-chun, chairman of the Taiwan Organ Registry and Sharing Center,
attributed problems with promoting organ donations to "conservative and
conventional" practices.</P>
      <P>Many Taiwanese believe that a corpse should not be moved for eight hours after a
death, fearing that doing so could interfere with the deceased person's soul.</P>
      <P>According to Chang, the number of organ donors lags far behind that of patients
waiting for transplants in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Citing the latest figure compiled by relevant authorities earlier this month, he
reported, there are an average of 7,000 patients waiting for organ transplants
per year, a sharp contrast to the number of donors which averages just over 200.</P>
      <P>Ho Tian-yang,  a 20-year-old  Marfan syndrome  patient who unsuccessfully
underwent  four operations  before receiving  a transplant, told reporters that
he was able to recover thanks to his new heart.</P>

is now leading a normal life and will soon enter a university.</P>

      <P>Taiwan will donate US$1 million for relief and reconstruction in areas of China
hit hard by recent flooding that left more than 1,000 dead and hundreds missing,
the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>"The donation is to be made on humanitarian grounds in the wake of the floods

said.</P>
      <P>Mudslides brought by flooding on Aug. 7 almost leveled Zhouqu, killing 1,435 and
leaving 330 unaccounted for. In addition, heavy downpours also caused flooding
in the basins of the Yangtze River, the Yellow River, the Huai River and the
Songhua River, resulting in widespread casualties and property damage.</P>
      <P>In addition to donating US$100,000 in emergency relief and rescue funds promised

12 a month-long fund-raising campaign for the reconstruction of the devastated

    <TEXT>
      <P>Because of its possible negative impact on the Nov. 27 local elections, the
Legislative Yuan is not expected to deal with a bill that would introduce a
second-generation national health insurance (NHI) premium until after the
elections.</P>
      <P>One of the disputes surrounding the second-generation  NHI involves its premium
rate, which was recalculated with the goal of controlling the program's deficit.</P>
      <P>However, if the deficit is the result of poor management, how can people
continue to fill the money pit willingly? Problems that remain to be resolved
include the waste of medical resources and the non-stop expansion of medical
spending.</P>
      <P>In other words, improving the system's fundamentals is a more important issue
than improving its finances, because good finances come with good fundamentals.</P>
      <P>If the second-generation national health insurance system is the correct
approach, Department of Health Minister Yaung Chih-liang has the responsibility
to stay to prove it. If there are still doubts about the reform, Yaung has an
even greater responsibility to stay to ensure that it is functional. (Editorial

economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) an issue in the run-up to the

      <P>Obviously, the DPP is pulling out of the ECFA battleground for a new one.</P>
      <P>In a latest attempt to raise a new issue, Tsai's campaign team strongly
challenged the huge pile of debt built up by her KMT rival, Eric Liluan Chu,
during his two terms as Taoyuan County magistrate. In response, Chu admitted
that Taoyuan County's debt had increased by NT$15 billion when he stepped down
from the magistrate position, but he also stressed that the county's assets had
risen by NT$220 billion over the same period.</P>
      <P>This demonstrates that the DPP's bombardment has again missed the target.</P>
      <P>Now that Chu has already presented his plan to develop Xinbei City, it would be
better for the DPP to put forward its own policy blueprint than repeatedly

    <HEADLINE>Talk of the day -- Mixed reaction to Judicial Yuan nominations</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>08/25/10  11:41:05
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou's nomination of Rai Hau-min, a veteran lawyer who now
chairs the Central Election Commission, as the new Judicial Yuan chief, and Su
Yeong-chin, a law professor closely associated with Ma, as Rai's deputy has
drawn mixed reaction.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from local media coverage of the development:</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>President Ma told a news conference Tuesday that he expected that the Rai-Su
team will lead what he called "national judicial reform, " in which the Judicial
Yuan will join forces with incorruptible judicial personnel as well as legal
experts and individual activists to clean up the beleaguered judicial system and
restore public trust in the judiciary.</P>
      <P>For the ongoing judicial reform to be successful, Ma said, it cannot just rely
on a few elites but will need the help of everybody concerned with the issue.
"Only through extensive consultations can we know what grassroots people think
and how they feel," he added.</P>
      <P>Rai said he was shocked to receive the nomination, but decided to accept the
challenge with pleasure as he empathized with those disappointed in the judicial
system.</P>
      <P>If the Legislative Yuan confirms his nomination, the 71-year-old said, he will
commit himself to judicial reform.</P>
      <P>"I will take bold steps to overhaul the judicial system after forging a national
consensus as our people cannot wait any longer for long overdue judicial
reform," he added. (Aug. 25, 2010).</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>President Ma outlined major reasons for nominating Rai and Su to head the
Judicial Yuan, saying both are honest, highly professional and widely respected
and have the enthusiasm to promote judicial reform.</P>
      <P>Ma also mentioned their work as advisers to the government and their experience
in leading independent administrative agencies. Su once headed the National
Communications Commission, an independent regulatory body supervising media and
telecom operations.</P>
      <P>For his part, Rai said Taiwan's people are, in fact, not asking a lot of the
judiciary.</P>
      <P>"All they want to see are judges who are not corrupt, and who are fair, honest,
even-tempered and effective, " Rai said. He added that measures would be taken
to prevent delays in judicial proceedings in addition to launching a crackdown
on corruption.</P>
      <P>On the nomination of Rai and Su, former President Lee Teng-hui said Ma had only
recruited his confidants to his administrative team. "He should instead employ
truly competent persons," Lee contended. (Aug. 25, 2010).</P>
      <P>Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>Political sources said Ma originally intended to name Su, a core member of Ma's
brain trust and the younger brother of former National Security Council
Secretary-General Su Chi, as Judicial Yuan head, but instead named him as Rai's
deputy to stem criticism that he had recruited a protege to manipulate the
judiciary.</P>
      <P>Ruling Kuomintang lawmakers generally responded favorably to Ma's nomination of
Rai and Su for the Judicial Yuan leadership posts. Lin Hung-chi, the party's
legislative whip, said Rai has no partisan affiliation and has never worked in
the judicial system, allowing him a freer hand to clean up the ranks of the
judiciary.</P>
      <P>But Ker Chien-ming, the opposition Democratic Progressive Party's legislative
caucus convener,  expressed his doubts about Rai's ability, saying he is too old
and may be just a figurehead to pave the way for Ma's protege, Su, to take over
the top judicial post in the future. Given Su's close ties with Ma, Ker said he
believes that Su will pull the strings from behind the scenes, rendering Rai to
a figurehead role. (Aug. 25, 2010).</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A recently signed trade pact between Taiwan and China will be advantageous to
Israeli enterprises that want to invest in Taiwan or use Taiwan as a springboard
or partner to enter Asian markets, Taiwan's representative to Israel said
Tuesday in Tel Aviv.</P>
      <P>In a briefing on the direction of Taiwan's efforts to solicit investment
following the signing of the cross-Taiwan Strait economic cooperation framework
agreement (ECFA) in June, representative Chang Liang-jen touted Taiwan's
geographic and economic position.</P>
      <P>Located at the intersection of Northeast Asia and Southeast Asia, Taiwan
occupies a strong strategic economic position in the region and can use China as
a "hinterland," he said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and China have signed 14 agreements and the ECFA since President Ma Ying-
jeou took office in 2008, Chang noted, and said that Israeli enterprises are
welcome to invest in Taiwan or use Taiwan as a springboard or economic partner
to venture into the vast Chinese market and other markets in Asia.</P>
      <P>He said that Israeli businesses could enjoy tariff-free treatment for certain
goods sold to China under the ECFA and could also take advantage  of  Taiwanese
businesses'  knowledge  of  business opportunities and China's commercial
environment to expand their market there and secure dual legal protections.</P>
      <P>Jerry M. J. Shyy, the economic division head of the Taipei Economic and Cultural
Representative Office in Tel-Aviv, briefed those attending the event on Taiwan's
economic development and competitive advantages, the current state of foreign
investment in Taiwan and incentives for foreign businesses to invest in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Shyy also introduced Taiwan's 12 major infrastructure projects, six emerging
industries  for prioritized  development,  and an investment-solicitation forum
Taiwan's government plans to hold on Sept. 23.</P>
      <P>Wang Chun-chieh, a former adviser to the Taiwan branch of IBM, also delivered a
speech on business opportunities in Taiwan's high-tech industry.</P>
      <P>Saying that digital content will be a star industry in the coming decade, Wang
suggested that Israeli enterprises in the sector capitalize on their R&amp;D and
innovation advantages to collaborate with Taiwanese companies.</P>
      <P>According to Chang, Taiwan is aggressively promoting cultural as well as
economic and trade cooperation with Israel, and this year two-way trade between
the two countries is expected to reach US$1.2 billion and could increase
further.</P>
      <P>The briefing drew 60 people from the Israeli media, political and business
sectors.</P>

      <P>A U.S. court recently prohibited three present and former executives of Taiwan-
based AU Optronics Corp. from leaving California after they were indicted on
charges of colluding to fix prices of TFT-LCD panels with other Asian
manufacturers.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's  Fair Trade Commission  (FTC)  should  seize this opportunity to build
up a channel for information exchange and cooperation with the Antitrust
Division under the U.S. Department of Justice.</P>
      <P>Since 2006, the United States, the European Union, Japan and South Korea have
launched extensive anti-monopoly investigations targeting the LCD industry that
also involve some manufacturers from Taiwan. It is time for the FTC to exercise
its authority by taking the initiative to investigate the situation.</P>
      <P>Taiwan should also examine its Fair Trade Act, under which those engaging in
collusion are currently first slapped with administrative penalties and do not
face immediate imprisonment. However, the people of this country should rebuild
basic values that reject monopoly controls, and acts violating these values
should be punished by imprisonment. (Editorial abstract -- Aug. 25, 2010)</P>

      <P>A passenger from Taiwan was among the people injured in a plane crash in China's

      <P>The Henan Airlines plane carrying 91 passengers and five crew crashed in heavy

said.</P>
      <P>The ERJ-190 jet, manufactured by Brazil's aerospace conglomerate Embraer and

      <P>Three present and former executives of flat panel maker AU Optronics Corp.
(AUO), who have been barred by a court in San Francisco from leaving California,
appeared to settle into normal routines Tuesday as they wait to appeal the
travel ban.</P>
      <P>AUO CEO Chen Lai-juh and AUO Vice Chairman Chen Hsuan-bin remained in San
Francisco, where their case is being heard, to manage AUO's business interests
there, while former AUO Executive Vice President Hsiung Hui returned to his
residence in San Diego.</P>
      <P>The three executives, along with AUO, its U.S. subsidiary, and other senior
managers, were indicted in June by the U.S. Department of Justice for conspiring
to fix the prices of TFT-LCD panels from Sept. 14, 2001 to Dec. 1, 2006.</P>
      <P>AUO has repeatedly denied the accusations and vowed to fight the charges, even
though other Asian flat panel makers have settled similar charges through plea
bargains.</P>
      <P>The three executives traveled to the U.S. at the end of July to plead their
cases, but ended up being forced to stay there.</P>
      <P>According to sources familiar with the case, the U.S. District Court for the
Northern District of California originally agreed to release the men on US$10
million bail after receiving a letter from AUO guaranteeing their future court
appearances.</P>
      <P>But prosecutors appealed, saying the men posed a flight risk because they live
and work in Taiwan, which does not have an extradition agreement with the U.S.,
and the court agreed, ordering on Aug. 19 that the executives' passports be
confiscated and their movements limited.</P>
      <P>According to the court order, the AUO CEO and vice chairman are restricted  to
northern California because they are still AUO executives.</P>
      <P>Hsiung, who is now president and CEO of ODM service provider Qisda Corp., which
along with AUO is also a member of the BenQ Group, is allowed to go anywhere
inside California.</P>
      <P>Within their restricted areas, the three have full freedoms and can communicate
with AUO headquarters and their families in Taiwan without any limitations.</P>
      <P>If they need to leave California for other U.S. states, they must first obtain
the court's permission  and return to the state immediately after handling their
business outside state lines.</P>
      <P>The executives are now waiting for further documents and evidence their lawyers
are preparing in a bid to persuade the court that the three are not a flight
risk and that the travel ban can be lifted.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's government has tried to help the three executives by issuing letters to
the court that guarantee they would show up in court as requested after
returning to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih has also asked his Cabinet to work closely with AUO and local
lawyers to do whatever they can to find a way to convince the U.S. court to
rescind the order.</P>

      <P>About 20 tourists from eastern China's Jiangsu Province will visit Taiwan Sept.
19 for six days of health checks and sightseeing, making it the first large
medical tourism group to visit Taiwan since the signing of a cross-Taiwan Strait
trade pact in June.</P>
      <P>The trip has been arranged by Shin Kong Wu Ho-Su Memorial Hospital in Taipei and
the China-based Jiangsu China Travel Service (JSCTS).</P>
      <P>Hung Tzu-zin, director of a health management center affiliated with the
hospital, said that in addition to the positron emission tomography (PET)
scanning previously offered, the Chinese visitors will also be given the newly
added 256-slice cardiac computed tomography (CT) scanning. Both are non-invasive
checks.</P>
      <P>Hung said that 256-slice CT-scans are used as a fast and non-invasive method for
detecting vascular calcification of the coronary arteries and for accurate
diagnosis of cardiovascular, peripheral vascular and other diseases.</P>
      <P>PET scans are performed to detect cancer, to determine whether a cancer has
spread in the body, and is a popular health check item among Chinese medical
tourists visiting Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The tour package costs around 15,000 Chinese yuan (NT$70,666) per person, said
JSCTS General Manager Yang Qilong.</P>
      <P>At the end of this year, the number of Chinese tourists from Jiangsu to have
visited Taiwan for health checks is expected to have reached 25,000, he added.</P>
      <P>The hospital and the travel agency will hold an event Aug. 27 in the Chinese
city of Nanjing to promote medical tourism in Taiwan, targeting representatives

      <P>Taiwan share prices closed down 2.56 percent Wednesday in heavy trade as
investors rushed to dump their holdings after a selloff on Wall Street overnight
amid economic concerns, dealers said.</P>
      <P>The weighted index closed down 203.66 points to the day's low of 7,736.98, off a
high of 7,889.57, on turnover of NT$159.31 billion (US$4.98 billion).</P>
      <P>The market opened down 0.64 percent after Wall Street's 1.3 percent fall, and
selling accelerated across the board after the latest disappointing U.S. home
sales data cemented fears that the slower pace of the U.S. economy will affect
global demand, dealers said.</P>
      <P>A total of 3,358 stocks closed down, 637 were up and 91 remained unchanged.</P>
      <P>Textile stocks faced the heaviest selling, finishing down 5.4 percent.
Construction stocks fell 4.2 percent, cement and foodstuffs lost 3.6 percent and
financial shares shed 3.5 percent.</P>
      <P>The paper and pulp, and plastics and chemical sectors closed down 2.2 percent
each, and the machinery and electronics sector fell 2.1 percent.</P>
      <P>"The expanded turnover showed investors acted in panic, " Taiwan International
Securities analyst Michael Chiang said.</P>
      <P>"Investors have become much more cautious about the global economy, fearing the
U.S. home sales data will breed further gloomy economic figures," he said.</P>
      <P>Chiang said that by falling below the technical support level of 7,800 helped to
destabilize the local bourse, leaving the market technically weaker.</P>
      <P>"Further volatility on Wall Street is possible as the Dow Jones Industrial
Average is on the brink of falling below the key 10,000 points, " Chiang said,
"Foreign institutional investors are likely to cut their holdings here to meet
demand for redemption back home."</P>
      <P>Old economy stocks encountered higher pressure after making significant gains
recently on hopes that increasing commerce with China would boost earnings,
dealers said.</P>
      <P>"Valuations of these traditional industrial stocks still remain high.  It is
possible  that they will see more  selling  on profit-taking," Chiang said.</P>
      <P>Large cap electronics and financial stocks, however, are worth the market's
attention as they appear attractive after recent consolidation, he said.</P>
      <P>Among old economy stocks, Shinkong Textile shed 6.88 percent to NT$37.90, Prince
Housing fell 6.58 percent to NT$17.05 and Taiwan Cement lost 2.33 percent to

      <P>Seventy percent of universities included in a nationwide student rights
evaluation received failing scores, reflecting  a general disregard for student
rights in Taiwan, according to a panel of students who conducted the survey
released Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The evaluation, conducted among 65 universities around Taiwan, rated National
Chung Cheng University (CCU) best in terms of protecting student rights, with a
score of 82.71. Tatung University received the lowest rating of 21.29.</P>
      <P>National Taiwan University  (NTU)  --  the country's  most distinguished
academic institute -- only ranked 13th, with a rating of 62.65.</P>
      <P>The evaluation was carried out by a panel of students from NTU, National Sun

      <P>Besides Tatung University, others ranking in the bottom five were I-Shou
University, Huafan University, Asia University, and National University of
Tainan.</P>
      <P>The results revealed that 57 percent of universities forbid students from
organizing assemblies or parades, and 38 percent have a system for penalizing
those who encourage student movements or protest activities.</P>
      <P>The panel used 26 criteria to rate the universities, including whether the
schools lock their gates at night to prevent students from entering or exiting,
strictness of dormitory regulations, gender equality and freedom of speech.</P>

      <P>The head of a local petrochemical association urged the Formosa Plastics Group
Wednesday to review two fires that broke out at its petrochemical complex in
Yunlin County in July and prevent the recurrence of similar accidents.</P>
      <P>Preston W. Chen, executive director of the Petrochemical Industry Association of
Taiwan, said at a general assembly of the association that Formosa Plastics
should reflect on the accidents, but he also urged the public to give the
company more time to deal with the situation.</P>
      <P>Chen also said he regretted that the petrochemical industry had not done enough
to change the public's misconception about the sector and that one of the
industry's main tasks in the future would be to do more to protect the
environment to ease public concerns.</P>
      <P>Despite  mounting  opposition  to the  development  of the petrochemical
industry, Chen said it makes a vital contribution to the country's economic
growth, making its existence necessary, and many countries, including Singapore,
are still expanding the scale of their petrochemical capacity.</P>
      <P>Chen, who hopes to build a new Kuokuang petrochemical complex on Taiwan's
western coast in Changhua County but is facing stiff resistance, said the
industry's importance is reflected by the fact that 80 percent of the raw
materials for the high-tech sector and 90 percent of consumer products are made
from petrochemicals.</P>
      <P>The annual output value of Taiwan's petrochemical industry is about NT$1.7
trillion, accounting for 30 percent of the value produced by the country's
manufacturing sector, Chen added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.S. confirms approval of three arms sales to Taiwan</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington, Aug. 24 (CNA)
08/25/10  18:04:11
(By Zep Hu and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The U.S. Department of State confirmed Tuesday that it had notified Congress of
its decision to allow U.S. companies to sell Taiwan defense articles and
services to support and upgrade its existing air defense radar systems.</P>
      <P>Philip Crowley, assistant secretary of state for public affairs, said during a
regular news briefing that the State Department had notified Congress as
required under the Arms Export Control Act of the proposed direct commercial
sales (DCS) between Taiwan and private U.S. companies.</P>
      <P>Under the DCS program, Crowley said, the foreign customer enters into a direct
relationship with a private U.S. company, which must then apply for an export
license from the State Department in accordance with U.S. law.</P>
      <P>The decision to approve these export licenses will allow the commercial export
to Taiwan of defense services, technical data and defense articles to support
Taiwan's existing air defense radar system and improvements to existing radar
used in Taiwan's Ching-kuo indigenous defense fighter aircraft, Crowley said.</P>
      <P>He further said the authorizing of the export licenses is fully consistent with
Washington's "one China" policy based on three U.S.-China joint communiques and
the Taiwan Relations Act.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the latest arms sales to Taiwan will draw strong protests from
Chinese authorities, Crowley said that he will "let China react to this as they
see fit."</P>
      <P>Rupert Hammond-Chambers, president of the U.S.-Taiwan Business Council, said
during a visit to Taiwan in June that the State Department had been forced to
defer three arms sales to Taiwan under Chinese pressure.</P>
      <P>However, the council, which groups U.S. companies with interests in Taiwan, said
Tuesday that the U.S. administration notified Congress Aug. 12 of its decision
to approve the sales.</P>
      <P>The council further said it believes the latest State Department decision will
contribute to returning to normal U.S. arms sales to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In the past, the United States usually sold arms to Taiwan under its Foreign
Military Sales (FMS) system, with the U.S. government supervising bidding,
production and delivery of the defense articles, services and technological
data.</P>
      <P>Under the FMS system, the U.S. government is responsible for enforcing the sales
contracts. The model operates as if it is the U.S. government procuring the
items from private contractors and reselling them to the foreign customer. The
FMS system is more costly for the procuring countries because they have to foot
the U.S. government's administrative bill, but the deal is less risky and offers
greater guarantee of success.</P>
      <P>In contrast, the DCS system is more flexible and costs less for the procuring
country. However, it is also less transparent and less secure. As export
licenses issued under the DCS system remain valid for only four years, procuring
countries face higher risks of any deal going into default.</P>
      <P>State Department studies show that only 50 percent of approved DCS deals are
actually substantiated and delivered.</P>
      <P>According to statistics compiled by the Center for International Policy -- a
U.S. think tank -- about 52 percent of U.S. arms deals struck between 1986 and
1996 were brokered under the DCS system.</P>
      <P>The think tank said foreign countries that opt for the DCS system tend to be
familiar with the U.S. defense industry and capable of directly negotiating
prices with U.S. defense contractors. Taiwan on the other hand has seldom used
the DCS system.</P>
      <P>Both the DCS and FMS systems require the U.S. administrative branch to notify
Congress of each approved arms deal worth more than a specified amount of money.
The deal will automatically take effect if Congress does not pass a resolution
against the deal within 30 days.</P>
      <P>As the executive branch tends to reach consensus with Congress on specific deals
before serving formal notice, there is little in the way of precedent in which
Congress has voted against such deals.</P>
      <P>However, it remained unclear why the State Department referred the Taiwan arms
sales during the Congress recess rather than the normal practice of submitting
the referral during the Congress session.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Notebook computer firm Compal Electronics, Inc. said Wednesday that it plans to
set up a joint venture in China with South Korea's flat panel maker LG Display
Co., focusing on the production of components used in notebooks.</P>
      <P>In a statement filed with the Taiwan Stock Exchange, Compal said its wholly
owned unit Compal International Holding Co. will invest US$7.35 million in the
joint venture, which will be located in Kunshan, in China's Jiangsu Province.</P>
      <P>The two partners have tentatively set the capital size of the new company at
US$15 million. Based on this figure, Compal is expected to take a 49 percent
stake and LGD will hold the remaining 51 percent.</P>
      <P>Apart from the production of components, the joint venture will also be engaged
in research and development in notebook production, assembly and marketing, the
statement said.</P>
      <P>"It is a good move for Compal to work with LGD, " MasterLink Securities analyst
Tom Tang said, "Amid fierce competition in the global notebook market, teaming
up with a foreign firm is expected to pin down more potential buyers for
Compal."</P>
      <P>"How to boost shipments has become critical, as the gross margin of many
contract notebook makers has been seriously squeezed,"  Tang said.</P>
      <P>He estimated that Compal's gross margin has fallen below 5 percent as
competition has escalated.</P>
      <P>Tang said that in the first half of this year, notebook firms suffered from a
shortage of components.</P>
      <P>"The new joint venture... is expected to cushion the possible impact from future
insufficient component supplies," Tang said.</P>
      <P>Grand Cathay Securities analyst Mars Hsu agreed, saying that as LGD is good at
thin film transistor liquid crystal display (TFT LCD) production, one of the
most important notebook components, the cooperation is expected to help Compal
secure flat panel supplies.</P>
      <P>More importantly, Hsu said, LGD is one of the suppliers for Apple's iPad. "I
suspect Compal is eyeing orders from Apple through the joint venture," he added.</P>
      <P>Compal officials were not available for comment.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Magazine digest -- Award-winning farmer maintains guava 'museum'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>08/25/10  18:25:54
(CommonWealth 453)(translated by Kay Liu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Chiang Tsai-lang's dedication to growing guavas for more than 40 years has seen
him create a wealth of varieties, making his 4,850-square-meter farm in central
Taiwan a "museum of guava" and a must-see attraction for anyone interested in
his unique growing and cultivation techniques.</P>
      <P>In addition to the common varieties of guava, the 68-year-old's farm in Changhua
County's Yuanlin Township boasts such oddities as purple guavas and guavas that
look like watermelons on the inside. To identify each variety, Chiang tags his
trees with labels in various colors.</P>
      <P>Chiang began to study farm management, pest control and growing techniques after
becoming the first head of a local guava production and marketing group in 1989,
and his work won him an "Outstanding Farmer" award from the Council of
Agriculture in 2006.</P>
      <P>"Farmers used to grow without a plan and focus on quantity rather than quality.
All this had to change, " Chiang said, explaining what he learned from the
group's poor sales at various fairs when it was first getting started.</P>
      <P>Chiang's first success came when he developed a fragrant variety of guava in
1994 that sold for NT$160 (US$5) per jin -- a traditional measurement equal to
about 600 grams -- at a time when the price for mainstream Thai-style guavas
were selling for NT$30 per jin.</P>
      <P>Wilma Ku, owner of the jam brand Red on Tree, which buys 360 kilograms of
Chiang's fragrant guavas every month, said the variety is perfect for her jam
not only because of its fragrance but also its durability while being
transported.</P>
      <P>In addition to new varieties, Chiang has developed his own method for producing
seedlings from tree branches, which saves money and prevents diseases or pests
brought in by seedlings purchased from outside.</P>
      <P>He also uses sugarcane instead of chemical fertilizer on his farm and received
"Good Agriculture Practice" (GAP) certification in 1998 -- well ahead of many
other farmers.</P>
      <P>As Chiang believes branding "is about a recognition of quality that stands out
among others" and can solve the problem of production surpluses, one of his
major projects was setting up a brand for the guava production and marketing
group.</P>
      <P>Chiang is getting older, but he remains determined to maintain the farm, despite
the fact that currently there is no one set to take over. He has reduced his
farm from five hectares to its present size and says he will share everything he
knows as long as there are people willing to learn.</P>

      <P>Taiwan and China police nabbed 450 suspects Wednesday in the largest-ever  joint
crackdown on fraud rings operating on the both sides of the Taiwan Strait,
according to Taiwan police.</P>
      <P>Criminal Investigation Bureau Director Lin Teh-hua said the raids were launched
simultaneously in Taiwan's 12 counties and cities and the Chinese provinces of
Fujian, Huanan, Hubei, Anhui, Guangdong and Guangxi, and in Chongqing City.</P>
      <P>Some 548 Taiwanese law enforcement officers and 2,720 Chinese police took part
in the operation.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, 121 people were arrested and NT$11 million, believed to be swindled
funds, was seized. Items such as computers, cell phones, servers, forged
official seals, fake courier uniforms, pistols, "manuals" on fraud, and bank
books were also confiscated.</P>
      <P>Across the strait, Chinese police officers arrested 329 suspects and seized
similar items that were believed to have been used in the operations of the
fraud rings.</P>
      <P>Taiwan police said that fraud rings usually swindle people by posing as
prosecutors, failing to deliver goods bought on websites, convincing victims to
remit money via ATMs, and delivering only empty boxes to people who purchased
goods.</P>
      <P>Lin said that police units on both sides of the strait had previously arrested
more than 1,000 scammers in 16 joint raids since an agreement on cross-strait
cooperation in crime fighting was signed last year.</P>
      <P>Notably,  Lin said, operators of several telecommunications companies in Taiwan
and China, which helped transmit calls in cases of fraud, were arrested this
time, as police found these operators were part of the scheme rather than
innocent third parties as they had claimed.</P>

      <P>Taiwan has developed a new variety of millet that yields nearly three times as
much as regular millet, a local agricultural research group said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The new millet -- "Taitung No. 8" -- was unveiled recently in Taitung County in
eastern Taiwan after years of research.</P>
      <P>The new variety can yield up to 3,000 kilograms per hectare -- nearly 300
percent higher than regular millet, according to the Taitung District
Agricultural Research and Extension Station under the Council of Agriculture.</P>
      <P>The agricultural research station said that the high-yield millet is also easy
to plant because it does not need as much water as rice. It can even be used a
substitute for rice during periods of drought, the station said.</P>
      <P>"With a global food shortage looming, millet can be a good source of nutrients
because it contains more calories, proteins and fats than wheat or rice and
almost as much fiber as oats, " said Chen Chen-yi, an assistant researcher at
the Taitung station.</P>
      <P>Millet contains vitamin A, vitamin B2, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, and vitamin E,
which are rarely found in most grains, and traces of selenium, a mineral that is
also good for health, the station said.</P>
      <P>The total acreage of millet in Taiwan has dropped to less than 300 hectares from
a peak of 6,000 hectares in the past when it was one the main staples in
aboriginal communities, Chen said.</P>
      <P>The quality and yield of millet, which is planted mainly in Pingtung and Taitung
counties, have been relatively poor because the seed quality deteriorated over
time, the station said.</P>
      <P>The new variety will be made available to local aboriginal communities for
planting and it is hoped that more millet-based food products will be developed
to help diversify the agricultural industry, it said.</P>

      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih said Wednesday that the government will seek a better deal
for local financial service companies in the new round of Taiwan-China trade
talks, as he acknowledged that the previous negotiations did not result in
financial liberalization.</P>
      <P>"We know that we did not open the door wide enough for the financial sector, "
he told business leaders and reporters before a closed-door breakfast meeting.</P>
      <P>"There is still a lot of room for improvement (in easing restrictions on
financial services between Taiwan and China) , " he said. "We should work
together and act cautiously to seek stable development in the long run."</P>
      <P>The premier said that the government will work to include financial services in
the next round of negotiations under the economic cooperation framework
agreement (ECFA) that was signed by Taiwan and China in late June and ratified
by the Taiwan legislature earlier this month.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and China will launch a new round of trade talks within six months after
the trade pact takes effect in September most likely.</P>
      <P>Wu's remarks came amid calls for the government to help ease restrictions in the
local financial sector.</P>
      <P>For example, the Chinese National Association of Industry and Commerce, Taiwan
(CNAIC), said after the breakfast meeting, Taiwanese banks can open branches in
China, but not subsidiaries.</P>
      <P>This bars Taiwanese banks from issuing bank cards and engaging in the Chinese
currency-related business in China, which shuts them out from China's booming
financial trade, the association said.</P>
      <P>The restrictions also render Taiwanese banks less competitive as their foreign
counterparts have been setting up subsidiaries since they entered China in late
2006, the association added.</P>
      <P>Christina Liu, chairwoman of the Cabinet-level Council for Economic Planning and
Development (CEPD) , told reporters after the meeting that the government will
continue to negotiate with China on these matters, and will also review its own
regulations.</P>

association that he agreed the government should give financial institutions

      <P>The widespread adoption in the next three years of a set of international
accounting standards, as required by the government, will create huge business
opportunities for local and foreign information service providers, an expert
said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>"By 2013,  1,559 companies  listed on Taiwan's bourse and over-the-counter
market will be required to adopt the International Financial Reporting Standards
(IFRS)," Harry Yu, chairman of Taiwan's Ares International Corp., said at the
launch of an alliance dedicated to promoting the IFRS.</P>
      <P>"Some of the companies will begin testing the standards in 2012," said Yu, who
is also the head of the alliance.</P>
      <P>He said that 117 countries have adopted the IFRS, which requires companies  to
publish monthly rather than quarterly  financial statements.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, the companies that switch to the IFRS are likely to spend NT$70
billion (US$2.2 billion) on the changeover, he said, adding that only NT$1.5
billion of that amount will go to Taiwanese software companies.</P>
      <P>"Domestic software companies are less experienced in this field, so foreign
enterprises such as Oracle will take the lion's share," he said.</P>
      <P>After 2013, Taiwan's 1.23 million small and medium enterprises (SMEs) will
follow suit and adopt the standards, Yu said.</P>
      <P>When they make the change, many of these SMEs will choose local information
service firms over foreign ones in an effort to save costs, he said.</P>
      <P>The alliance, which comprises officials from the industrial bureau, accountants
and business executives, is aiming to see at least 100 IFRS service providers in
Taiwan, Yu said.</P>
      <P>These service providers will also be able to explore business opportunities
overseas by serving Taiwanese businesses operating in China, Vietnam and other

      <P>Neo Solar Power Corp., a leading solar cell manufacturer,  began on Wednesday
to build a southern Taiwan operations hub that is expected to be capable of
producing 3.4 gigawatts of solar cells a year after its scheduled completion in
three to four years.</P>
      <P>Quincy Lin, chairman of the company, said at a groundbreaking ceremony that the
company's production of solar cells is about 620 megawatts at present and could
grow to 800 MW by the end of this year.</P>
      <P>To meet strong demand at home and abroad, the company will invest NT$30 billion
to build the center at Tainan Science Park, Lin said, adding that its capacity
could eventually reach 4.2 GW, which would make it one of the three largest
manufacturers in the world.</P>
      <P>It is expected to create 1,000 jobs and generate NT$140 billion in revenue, Lin
said.</P>
      <P>Currently, 40 percent of the company's products are sold to China, according to
Lin.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's production capacity of solar cells is higher than China's, while China
produces more solar silicon wafers, he said, adding that the two sides should
cooperate and complement each other in the sector.</P>
      <P>Vice President Vincent Siew, who was also at the ceremony, said that the
government is seeking balanced development of southern and northern Taiwan and
that the solar energy sector is a promising industry. He said he hopes the
establishment of the company's facility in southern Taiwan will create a solar
industry cluster effect there.</P>
      <P>Vice Minister of Economic Affairs Huang Jung-chiou said that Taiwan's production
of solar cells is about 2.5 GW a year and that after going into operation, the

      <P>Citizens in the municipality of Masatepe in Nicaragua held a ceremony Tuesday to
celebrate the completion of the first phase of a "Taiwan Village" residential
project in the city, according to sources with the Republic of China embassy in
Nicaragua.</P>
      <P>The "Taiwan Village" residential project, funded by the Care2Help Charitable
Association, aims to build a total of 30 units at affordable prices for citizens
of the city. The first phase saw 16 units completed.</P>
      <P>Charity founder Weng Yen-tien and his wife presided over the ceremony, arriving
to a warm welcome.</P>
      <P>Republic of China Ambassador to Nicaragua Wu Chin-mun also attended the
ceremony.</P>
      <P>Masatepe Mayor Luis Manuel Morales said the "Taiwan Village" residences are
built of cement and bricks, in sharp contrast to the existing housing in the
city, which is mostly made of iron sheeting and plastic materials.</P>
      <P>The mayor said the new buildings are expected to provide a safe and secure

      <P>A band from southern Taiwan will head to South Korea on Sept. 9 to participate
in an international music festival, Chiayi Mayor Huang Ming-hui said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The Chia Yi Wind Orchestra has been invited to perform as part of the Wonju

countries including Mexico, the Philippines, New Zealand, Russia and the United
States.</P>
      <P>The festival runs from Sept. 8-12.</P>
      <P>"The city band has opened a door for music exchanges between Taiwan and other
countries, helping Chiayi City win the right to host the biannual conference of
the World Association for Symphonic Bands and Ensembles (WASBE) in 2011, " Huang
said, adding that orchestras from around the world are welcome to join.</P>
      <P>The association, which boasts more than 1,000 individuals and organizations from

    <HEADLINE>Hospital uses light therapy for treating lung cancer</HEADLINE>

      <P>An advanced cancer treatment known as photodynamic therapy (PDT) has been found
to be efficient in extending the lives of terminal lung cancer patients, said a
surgeon at the Taipei-based Shin Kong Wu Ho-Su Memorial Hospital Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The hospital, which purchased the PDT technology from a U.S. group in 2006, said
that since then, 11 terminal lung cancer patients have received the treatment,
said Hsieh Yei-san, chief of the Thoracic Surgery Department.</P>
      <P>Five of the patients are still alive, one of whom has survived since undergoing
the therapy in November 2006, Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>"Compared with chemotherapy and targeted therapy, PDT can extend patients' life
by two times on average," he said.</P>
      <P>Hsieh explained that lung cancer cells grow quickly. Many lung cancer patients
are already in the terminal stage upon initial diagnosis and can only be
prescribed the traditional treatments of chemotherapy or radiation therapy, he
said.</P>
      <P>Those treatments, however, have only limited efficiency in extending the lives
of patients, Hsieh said, citing statistics showing the five-year survival rate
of such patients is only 20 percent to 30 percent.</P>
      <P>"Even with targeted therapy, life can only be extended for an additional three
months on average," he added.</P>
      <P>Noting that 30 percent of terminal lung cancer patients will develop the
complication of fluid in the pleura, Hsieh stated that in such cases, patients
can suffer from breathing difficulties and some will also develop rejection
against chemo and targeted therapies.</P>
      <P>Once the cancer spreads, the average survival rate will be reduced to between
six and nine months, he said.</P>
      <P>PDT is a treatment  that  uses light-sensitive  medication (sometimes  called a
photosensitizing  agent)  together with a particular type of light to destroy
cancer cells.</P>
      <P>The therapy enables surgeons to kill cancer cells that other kinds of surgical
operations cannot achieve, Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, a PDT procedure costs about NT$500,000 (US$15,600) , according to
Hsieh.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Legislators argue pros and cons of bigger bonus for civil servants</HEADLINE>

      <P>Legislators reacted along party lines Wednesday to a reported government plan to
offer public sector employees an extra half-month's salary as a year-end bonus
so that they can share in the benefits of the country's economic recovery.</P>
      <P>The United Daily News reported the same day that the Executive Yuan is working
on a plan to pay a bigger bonus to military personnel, civil servants and public
school teachers and will also explore the feasibility of raising the minimum
wage to spur private corporate owners to raise salaries.</P>
      <P>If all goes well, the Chinese-language daily said, the minimum wage may be
increased from the level of NT$17,280 (US$540) per month, where it has been
stuck since 2007.</P>
      <P>Opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Legislator Huang Wei-che said at a
news conference that the essence of rule of law lies in consistency.</P>
      <P>"If an extra half-month's salary is paid as a bonus this year, will it be
offered again next year? " he asked. "If the answer is yes, the proposal should
be reviewed comprehensively and clear regulations should be formulated to
support the adjustment, " Huang said.</P>
      <P>Howevr, if a bigger bonus is being offered only this year, it could fuel
speculations that it is an election bribe ahead of the mayoral polls in five
special municipalities on Nov. 27, he argued.</P>
      <P>This view was supported by Huang's colleague, Pan Men-an, who said that the DPP
is not opposed to a public-sector wage hike but the decision should not be an
impromptu or casual one. It is a matter that should be decided only after an
extensive review of the government's finances and the country's unemployment
rate and minimum wage level, he said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's civil servants have usually been paid one-month's salary as year-end
bonus.</P>
      <P>Legislator Yeh Yi-jin, also of the DPP, said remuneration for public-sector
employees,  including year-end bonus,  should be determined in accordance with
the existing law.</P>
      <P>"The proposed extra year-end bonus for public-sector workers is a scheme to
dodge legislative supervision,  which undermines the existing system and is
contrary to the spirit of rule of law, " Yeh said.</P>
      <P>Any changes regarding  monetary payments  to public sector employees should be
subject to institutionalized discussion and legislative scrutiny, she said.</P>
      <P>Legislator George Hsieh of the ruling Kuomintang, however, said he supports the
idea of giving public employees an extra year-end bonus instead of an across-
the-board salary hike.</P>
      <P>"Unlike a salary raise, a bigger year-end bonus is one-time move that will not
put any long-term strain on the national coffers, " he added.</P>

      <P>The government does not have any time frame for raising public-sector wages or
offering bigger year-end bonuses for public-sector employees, Premier Wu Den-yih
said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Wu dismissed a media report that had said the Executive Yuan is working on a
plan to pay an extra half-month's salary in year-end bonuses to military
personnel, civil servants and public school teachers.</P>
      <P>"Nobody in the government has ever made such a statement, nor has any date been
set for offering a bigger bonus for public-sector employees," Wu said.</P>
      <P>Whether the government considers any rise in public-sector wages will depend on
the country's economic performance in the second half of this year and the first
half of next year, he said.</P>
      <P>"Although we posted remarkable gains in gross domestic product (GDP) in the
first two quarters of this year, our economic outlook for the third and fourth
quarters remains hazy as economies of our major trading partners, including the
United States, Japan, Europe, and especially China and Hong Kong have shown
signs of slowing, " Wu said.</P>
      <P>Since the government still has to rely on borrowing to make ends meet in the
coming year, Wu said there was no plan to adjust public-sector wages or consider
larger year-end bonuses this year.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's travel businesses have organized a 164-member  tourism promotion

27-29, a tourism bureau official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The National Association of Travel Agents Singapore (NATAS) organizes consumer

      <P>The Taiwanese  mission,  organized  by the Taiwan Visitors Association,  will

      <P>An opposition lawmaker accused the Cabinet Wednesday of preferring a "black
rather than green" energy policy as it is reportedly  planning to set limits on
the capacity of photovoltaic systems.</P>
      <P>Legislator  Tien  Chiu-chin  of the  opposition  Democratic Progressive Party
said the government was moving at a snail's pace compared to other countries in
the development of green energy and furthermore is planning to cap the growth of
the industry.</P>
      <P>According to a report in the Commercial Times on Aug. 17, the government is
worried that it might not have enough funds to subsidize  the procurement  of
green energy  and is therefore considering a ceiling of 500 kilowatts capacity
for photovoltaic systems.</P>
      <P>Tien said she cannot understand this approach, especially as the government has
pledged to help develop the country's photovoltaic industry.</P>
      <P>At a press conference at the legislature, she questioned why the government
would want to abandon its green policy, and instead support the construction of
a new petrochemical complex in southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The Commercial Times report said that since April when the government unveiled a
system for buying renewable energy at a guaranteed price, there have been many
applications for permission to build photovoltaic systems around the country.</P>
      <P>If these systems are built, they will have a total capacity of 53,000 kilowatts
(KWs), close to the government target of 65,000 KWs per year, the report said.</P>
      <P>This does not include the proposed solar power projects by local governments,
which will have a total capacity 1.77 million KWs, the paper said.</P>
      <P>Officials at the Bureau of Energy could not be reached for comment, but the
bureau on Wednesday issued a statement saying that the government must leave
room for the installation of more advanced photovoltaic systems that are
expected to be more efficient and to cost less.</P>
      <P>The government is committed to the installation of photovoltaic systems around
the country and plans to double its photovoltaic capacity target to 2,000 MWs by
2025, the bureau said.</P>

      <P>A visit to Taiwan next month by a top Chinese negotiator is likely to be delayed
due mainly to a tight schedule that month for exchange visits across the Taiwan
Strait, the Taipei-based Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and China agreed during negotiations in Chongqing in late June that Chen
Yunlin, president of the Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Straits (ARATS) , will lead a business delegation on a visit to Taiwan on
Sept. 5.</P>
      <P>However, while there have been no changes in Taiwan's plans for Chen to visit,
it is not yet known whether the trip will take place before the end of the year,
the SEF said.</P>
      <P>SEF Vice Chairman Kao Koong-lian is currently in eastern China to meet with
Taiwanese businesspeople operating there.</P>
      <P>After he returns to Taiwan, SEF Chairman Chiang Pin- kung will travel to China
Sept. 16 to visit Taiwanese enterprises in Shanghai and Kunshan in Jiangsu
Province, the SEF said.</P>
      <P>On the Chinese side, Minister of Culture, Cai Wu is expected in Taipei soon,
while Acting Shannxi Governor Zhao Zhenyong is scheduled to visit on Sept. 16
and two Chinese delegations concerned with intellectual property rights and
judicial affairs will visit late next month, the SEF said.</P>
      <P>The SEF and ARATS are semi-official bodies authorized by their respective
governments to handle cross-strait exchanges in the absence of formal contact
between Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>Chen's last visit to Taiwan was in December 2009 for the fourth round of SEF-
ARATS talks in the central city of Taichung.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Kao said in Hangzhou earlier Wednesday that the SEF and ARATS will
exchange instruments on the cross-strait economic cooperation framework
agreement by the middle of next month. The pact was signed on June 29.</P>

rejecting unnecessary social invitations. He should also appoint supervisors who
are responsible and willing to offend their superiors when necessary.</P>

which influence peddling is prevalent. In addition, a code of conduct should be
set out for judges to overhaul their work discipline.</P>

    <DATELINE>Washington, Aug. 25 (CNA)
08/26/10  11:36:36

    <TEXT>
      <P>A senior Taiwan official posted in Washington expressed welcome Wednesday to the
U.S. government's recent decision to allow U.S. companies to sell Taiwan defense
articles and services directly without having to create "arms packages."</P>
      <P>The U.S. Department of State confirmed Tuesday that it had notified Congress of
its decision to allow U.S. companies to make commercial exports to Taiwan of
defense services and articles to support and upgrade the island's existing air
defense radar systems.</P>
      <P>The latest sales, worth over US$100 million, will be carried out under a direct
commercial sales (DCS) program between Taiwan and private U.S. companies, said
the Taiwan official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.</P>
      <P>"The new practice is poised to put U.S. arms sales to Taiwan back on their
normal track," the official said.</P>
      <P>He attributed the adoption of the DCS -- for the sales of items to support
Taiwan's air defense radar system and improve existing radar used in the Ching-
kuo indigenous defense fighter aircraft -- mainly to the fact that Taiwan's Air
Force "is already familiar with the systems."</P>
      <P>The U.S.-Taiwan Business Council, which groups U.S. companies with interests in
Taiwan, also said Tuesday that it believes the latest State Department decision
will contribute to returning U.S. arms sales to Taiwan to normal.</P>
      <P>In the past, the United States usually sold arms to Taiwan under a more time-
consuming Foreign Military Sales (FMS) system, with the U.S. government
supervising bidding, production and delivery of the defense articles, services
and technological data.</P>
      <P>Under the FMS system, the U.S. government is responsible for enforcing the sales
contracts. The model operates as if it is the U.S. government procuring the
items from private contractors and reselling them to the foreign customer. The
FMS system is more costly for the procuring countries because they have to pay
the U.S. government's administrative bill, but the deal is less risky and offers
greater guarantee of success.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan official also attributed the U.S. decision to the fact that "package"
sales and relevant announcements tend to make the matter "too high-profile, "
triggering political implications.</P>

    <DATELINE>08/26/10  11:49:58
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Liao Kuo-hau,  a 17-year-old allegedly responsible for the high-profile murder
of Taichung's gangland leader Weng Chi-nan on May 28, turned himself in to the
police Wednesday, 90 days after the shooting.</P>
      <P>He got in touch with ruling Kuomintang Legislator Justin Chou and expressed his
intention to surrender Wednesday afternoon. He was quoted as having complained
to Chou that he was a victim of Taiwan's education system, saying he was
discriminated against in school because he was from a broken family.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from the local media coverage of the news:</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>Liao reportedly contacted Chou through one of the lawmaker's supporters. In the
conversation that ensued, the teenager said he wanted to turn himself in. After
verifying his identity, Chou called Taichung City Police Chief Chiu Feng-kuang
to arrange for the surrender of one of the country's most wanted fugitives.</P>
      <P>Taichung City police officers later escorted Liao to the central Taiwan city
from Taipei by high-speed rail.</P>
      <P>Chou said he was sure that the teenager was the gunman when he first saw him.
"He was expressionless and quite composed. He was dressed just like an ordinary
teenage boy, but looked a bit haggard," the lawmaker recalled.</P>
      <P>According to Chou, Liao expressed discontent with Taiwan's education system. "He
told me that since he was a young child, his answers on examination sheets never
won the approval of his school teachers," Chou said.</P>
      <P>Liao's parents divorced when he was in elementary school and his father was a
drug addict who was in and out of prison. He was raised by his grandparents. His
grandmother operates a small restaurant staffed with young women. Liao told Chou
that he was discriminated against in school due to his family background.</P>
      <P>But Hsieh Sheng-nan, student affairs director of the junior high school from
which Liao graduated, said the teenager's complaints were not fair.</P>
      <P>"He should think about his own issues instead of blaming our education system.
Our teachers spent a lot of energy trying to remold him. We contacted his
grandparents and uncle more than 30 times in a single semester. Our teachers
tried their best to help him, but to no avail, " Hsieh said disappointingly.
(Aug. 26, 2010).</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>Teachers at Taiping Junior High School in Taichung County said Liao often dozed
off during lessons or skipped class. Even his grandmother had no way to get him
to go to school regularly, his former teachers said. His classmates said he was
a low-key person who seldom talked with classmates and just liked to be a silent
bystander.</P>
      <P>Police said Liao was escorted to Taipei by two underworld gang members -- Huang
Chun-lung and Chen Chien-chih, both of whom have been detained -- after shooting
kingpin Weng Chi-nan to death at Weng's office in Taichung on May 28.</P>
      <P>Several other suspects in the case, including Lin Ying-hao, who allegedly drove
Liao to and from Weng's office on the day of the crime, have also been arrested.</P>
      <P>Police said Liao's surrender will help clarify the procedural details of the
murder,  but it remains uncertain whether the mastermind and motives behind the
killing will be understood any time soon.</P>
      <P>The case ignited a public outcry as it was later discovered that four police
officers were at the scene playing mahjong, but did not intervene. The case
prompted the government to outline a new crime-fighting program, code-named
"Operation Thunder", to crack down on gang-related activities. The police
authorities also vowed to institute better discipline in the police force.</P>

      <P>Flat panel maker AU Optronics Corp. (AUO) will not plead guilty in plea bargains
but will fight the price-fixing charges brought by the Department of Justice of
the United States, a company defense lawyer said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>"The company has not pled because it believes that it did not commit the crime
for which it has been charged, " Christopher Nedeau, AUO's defense lawyer, said
in a written statement.</P>
      <P>"While the outcome of any case is uncertain, AUO is fighting the charges because
it is the right thing to do," Nedeau said.</P>
      <P>Three present and former AUO executives were barred from leaving the United
States by a court in San Francisco on Aug. 19 after they appeared for a hearing
on the case.</P>
      <P>In June, AUO, a subsidiary in Houston, and six of its senior executives were
indicted for allegedly conspiring to fix prices with other Asian flat panel
firms between Sept. 14, 2001 and Dec. 1, 2006.</P>
      <P>AUO has repeatedly denied the accusations and vowed to fight the charges, while
other Asian TFT-LCD firms have settled similar charges through plea bargaining.</P>
      <P>"Please keep in mind that under the US system of justice, the defendant is
presumed innocent until proven guilty," the lawyer said.</P>
      <P>"Neither AUO nor its employees have been convicted of any crime and the company
looks forward to clearing its name before a jury," he said.</P>
      <P>Nedeau said AUO is well-respected in Taiwan and throughout the world, and the
company's success was achieved by its employees' hard work and dedication.</P>
      <P>AUO CEO Chen Lai-juh and AUO Chairman Chen Hsuan-bin remain in San Francisco to
manage AUO's business interests there, while former AUO Executive Vice President
Hsiung Hui returned to his residence in San Diego.</P>
      <P>The CEO and vice chairman are required to remain in northern California as they
are still AUO executives, while Hsiung, who is now president and CEO of ODM
service provider Qisda Corp., is allowed to travel anywhere inside California.</P>
      <P>The three are free to communicate with AUO headquarters and their families in
Taiwan without limitations.</P>
      <P>If they need to leave California for other U.S. states, they have to obtain the
court's permission and return to the state immediately after handling their
business.</P>

well-planned use, such as promoting a low-carbon economy and guiding the
industrial sector to internalize the external cost of pollution.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FSC to prioritize policy on financial leasing companies</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) will prioritize policy on the opening
of financial leasing companies in China by financial holding companies, and will
introduce related proposals and measures within two days, an FSC official said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The announcement came after FSC Chairman Chen Yu-chang convened a meeting of
local banks and financial holding companies earlier that day. More than half the
participants gave suggestions concerning cross-Taiwan Strait financial links,
FSC Vice Chairman Wu Tang-chieh said after the meeting.</P>
      <P>They asked the country's top financial regulator  to ease restrictions on
investment in China by local banks, to relax rules for local banks to operate
Chinese currency services, to allow Taiwan's insurance companies to do business
in China, and to revise rules to allow Taiwanese securities firms to increase
their presence in China, he said.</P>
      <P>According to Wu, Chen told the attendants that the relationship between the FSC
and the financial industry sector should be defined as a partnership, and that
acting on the sector's suggestions, the FSC will first deal with policies on
services that do not require legal amendments.</P>
      <P>For example, Wu said, subsidiaries of financial holding companies are legally
permitted to set up financial leasing companies in China.</P>
      <P>As part of cross-strait liberalization, the Executive Yuan announced a list
earlier this year that opened 11 types of Chinese investment to Taiwanese
enterprises,  including financial firms investing in China's finance leasing
companies, Wu noted.</P>
      <P>As for services that require legal amendments, the FSC will carry out further
assessment and gather opinion from the banking and financial industries ahead of
talks between Taiwan and China on further financial liberation, Wu added.</P>
      <P>Some participants  suggested that the government relax the Regulations Governing
Approvals of Financial Institutions to Engage in Business and Investment
Activities between the Taiwan Area and the Mainland Chinese Area, according to
Wu.</P>
      <P>The regulations stipulate that Taiwanese banks wishing to enter the Chinese
market do so by establishing branches or subsidiary banks in China, or through
equity investment in banks in China. Of the three methods, however, they are
allowed to choose only two, and if they choose equity investment, their
participation is limited to one Chinese bank.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Thursday that it was "cautiously
optimistic" that Canada will grant Taiwan passport holders visa-free treatment
by the end of the year.</P>
      <P>Taipei and Ottawa agreed that the visa-free treatment for Taiwanese citizens
should not be linked with imports of Canadian beef -- as hoped by Canada's
agricultural ministry -- so political resistance  to the  issue  has been
overcome,  Harry  Tseng, director-general of the MOFA's Department of North
American Affairs, said at a regular press briefing.</P>
      <P>"It is expected to be settled after the Canadian side completes some internal
administration procedures, " Tseng said. "We are cautiously optimistic that the
deal will be sealed by the end of this year."</P>
      <P>Since Taiwan has already lifted visa requirements for Canadian citizens, the
Canadian government thinks it would be fair to grant the same privileges to
Taiwanese nationals, Tseng said.</P>
      <P>Ottawa  has expressed  hope  that Taiwan  will  reconsider restrictions on beef
imports from Canada, saying it is unfair to treat the U.S. and Canadian products
differently, he added.</P>
      <P>Tseng also said that it is unlikely that the United States will grant visa-free
access for Taiwanese visitors by the end of this year because Taiwan may not be
able to meet the requirements from Washington by that time.</P>
      <P>The U.S. wants Taiwan to raise the percentage of in-person passport applications
and stipulate that citizens have their ID photographs taken while applying for
passports.</P>
      <P>Many current Taiwanese  passport holders applied for their passports through
travel agents, but MOFA is now encouraging people to apply directly with the

      <P>The government has decided to extend its offer of subsidies to buyers of
electric motorbikes for another year, the Industrial Development Bureau (IDB)
under the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>In 2009, the MOEA allocated NT$1.6 billion (US$50 million) for subsidies over
four years to encourage people to buy environmentally friendly electric
motorbikes and scooters.</P>
      <P>The program was due to expire at the end of 2012 but will be extended for
another year and will be expanded to include bikes equipped with fixed lithium
fuel cells, IDB officials said.</P>
      <P>Currently, only bikes equipped portable lithium ion battery packs are included
in the program, which offers subsidies of NT$8,000 to NT$11,000 per vehicle.</P>
      <P>Last year the government set a four-year target of 100,000 locally made electric
motorbikes powered by replaceable batteries, as part of its efforts to save
energy and cut carbon emissions.</P>
      <P>The program started with three eligible manufacturers -- E-Ton Power Tech Co.,
Kwang Yang Motor Co. (Kymco), and China Motor Corp. (CMC). However, Sangyang
Industry Co. (SYM) is also now on board, IDB officials said.</P>
      <P>SYM manufactures a lightweight scooter model called EA1LU that is powered by a
48V portable lithium ion battery pack. The scooter weighs only 56 kilograms and
the battery can give 50 kilometers on a single charge at a speed of up to 45
kph.</P>
      <P>Other lightweight models that are included in the subsidy program are E-ton's
EV3A, Kymco's EA10BB and CMC's EM198. Buyers of these models can apply for a
subsidy of NT$8,000 each, the bureau said.</P>
      <P>The bikes cost NT$55,000 on average.</P>
      <P>Local manufacturers have been urging the government to raise its target for
electric motorbike sales to one million over a four-year period. They have also
asked the government to build recharging stations and dedicated lanes for
electric motorbikes in cities throughout Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has the highest scooter density in Asia, averaging one per 1.6 people,
according to government statistics. There are some 14.55 million scooters or
motorcycles in the country of 23 million people, the figures show.</P>

were banned from leaving the U.S., a Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) official
said.</P>
      <P>"The case is now in the middle of the legal process and the Taiwan government

conspiring to fix the prices of TFT-LCD panels from Sept. 14, 2001 to Dec. 1,
2006.</P>
      <P>The executives were barred from leaving the U.S. and told to remain in
California by a court in San Francisco on Aug. 19 after they appeared for a
hearing on the case.</P>
      <P>AUO CEO Chen Lai-juh and AUO Vice Chairman Chen Hsuan-bin remain in San
Francisco to manage AUO's business interests there, while former AUO Executive
Vice President Hsiung Hui returned to his residence in San Diego.</P>
      <P>Tseng said that the fact the executives traveled to the U.S. to plead their
cases showed they were not aiming to avoid court appearances.</P>
      <P>While the executives can still manage business within the U.S., a travel ban and
a long legal process could affect their business operation, he said.</P>
      <P>The ministry has been trying to consult the U.S. administrative branch on the
case as well as contacting officials from the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT)
, the U.S. representative office in Taiwan in the absence of official bilateral
diplomatic ties, Tseng said, but there was not much the government could do.</P>
      <P>The ministry learned about the case as early as July and AUO has sought legal
consultation from the ministry, he added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan share prices closed down 0.61 percent Thursday on follow-through selling
after the downside in the previous session amid lingering fears of a slower pace
of the global economy recovery, dealers said.</P>
      <P>The weighted index fell 47.24 points to 7,689.74, after moving between 7,666.51
and 7,758.14, on turnover of NT$119.44 billion (US$3.73 billion).</P>
      <P>The market opened up 6.14 points after Wall Street's slight rebound overnight,
but selling emerged immediately, putting pressure on old economy stocks that had
scored significant gains on warming cross-strait business ties, dealers said.</P>
      <P>After the index fell below the 7,700 points during the trade, bargain hunters
began picking up select large cap high tech stocks, which supported the broader
market to some extent, the dealers said.</P>
      <P>A total of 2,619 stocks closed down and 1,053 up, while 222 remained unchanged.</P>
      <P>The foodstuff sector suffered the steepest decline, dropping 2.4 percent. Cement
stocks fell 1.9 percent, financials lost 1.5 percent, paper and pulp shares
dropped 1.3 percent and textile stocks closed down 0.7 percent.</P>
      <P>The machinery and electronics sector fell 0.5 percent and the construction
sector lost 0.4 percent, while the plastics and chemical sector rose 0.3
percent.</P>
      <P>"The market remained overshadowed by concerns about the global economic
fundamentals, " TLG Asset Management analyst Arch Shih said, referring to recent
disappointing U.S. home sales figures.</P>
      <P>"After yesterday's sell-off, market sentiment has been hurt badly, with the
index failing to stage a technical rebound today," Shih said.</P>
      <P>The local bourse closed down 2.56 percent Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Shih said valuations of traditional industrial stocks, such as food and textile
firms, remained high despite Wednesday's heavy losses, but added that these
stocks may face further volatility in the near future.</P>
      <P>However, select electronics, in particular integrated circuit designers,
appeared attractive after recent consolidation, he said.</P>
      <P>"They could serve as a safe haven to park money, " he said. "But, I think
investors should boost cash positions in their portfolios for now and wait for
fresh leads before acting."</P>
      <P>In the foodstuff sector, Oceanic Beverages fell 6.93 percent to NT$25.50 and
Wei-Chuan Foods dropped 3.33 percent to NT$33.40.</P>
      <P>Among the financial stocks, Chang Hwa Bank fell 2.75 percent to NT$17.70 and
Cathay Financial dipped 1.27 percent to NT$46.70.</P>
      <P>On bargain hunting, IC designer MediaTek rose 1.62 percent to NT$438.00 and flat
panel maker AU Optronics increased 1.28 percent to NT$27.65.</P>

      <P>During recent talks with Taiwan, China did not rule out the possibility  of
notifying  the World  Trade Organization (WTO) of a recent trade pact with
Taiwan, an official familiar with the matter said Thursday.</P>
      <P>With Taiwan and China both playing a significant role in world trade, the
economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) that they signed in June has
drawn the attention of many WTO members, and the two sides recently discussed
whether they should formally notify the WTO of the ECFA, according to the
official.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, the Chinese representatives said China would not rule out
the possibility of doing so, the official said.</P>
      <P>Because the ECFA was signed by Taiwan's  Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) and
China's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) -- two semi-
official bodies responsible for handling two-way exchanges -- Taiwan will send
the WTO a letter signed by Minister of Economic Affairs Shih Yen-shiang,
explaining that the trade pact was inked with the authorization of the two
governments.</P>
      <P>The ECFA is considered  a regional  free trade agreement, therefore,
notification of the WTO is required, according to WTO rules.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the official said, since the Legislative Yuan ratified the ECFA
earlier this month, the economics ministry has been carrying out follow-up work
on the pact. The ministry has published an English version of the ECFA and
confirmed the accuracy and validity of its contents, the official said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan will hold further talks with China to confirm the content of the English
version and to discuss when the pact will go into effect, he added.</P>
      <P>SEF Vice Chairman Kao Koong-lian said the ECFA is likely to formally take effect
and be implemented in September after an exchange of instruments between Taiwan
and China.</P>

      <P>Eighteen percent of 16-year-old students are addicted to the Internet and are at
a higher risk than others for emotional disorders, a local hospital said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>The Tri-Service General Hospital conducted a survey at a Taipei high school for
three consecutive years and polled 2,600 freshmen with an average age of 16.</P>
      <P>The hospital defined Internet addiction disorders as excessive computer use that
interferes with an individual's job, schooling or social life.</P>
      <P>Nearly 20 percent of those deemed Internet addicts suffered emotional disorders,
with the rate for male students higher than that for females, said Wang Tzong-
shi, a psychiatrist specializing in teenagers at the hospital.</P>
      <P>Wang also said Internet addicts are more likely to suffer learning disabilities
and impulse control disorders.</P>
      <P>"If children surf the Net for six to seven hours a day and react very
emotionally when asked to stop, parents need to pay extra attention to the
addiction issue," Wang said.</P>
      <P>The psychiatrist said previous studies had found 6 percent to 15 percent of

    <TEXT>
      <P>The recent signing of an economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) between
Taiwan and China will contribute to regional peace and stability in East Asia, a
senior Taiwanese planner of China policy said Thursday.</P>
      <P>"The ECFA will also enable Taiwan to serve as a springboard for companies in
member states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to tap into
the vast Chinese market, " said Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Vice Chairman
Chao Chien-min at the opening of a symposium on the ECFA and relations among
Taiwan, China and ASEAN.</P>
      <P>In the wake of the ECFA's signing, Chao said, tensions across the Taiwan Strait
will drop further as both sides will be less likely to touch on sensitive
political issues and disputes.</P>
      <P>With the continuing dialogue and engagement between the two sides, Taiwan has
emerged as an ever-growing stabilizing force in the Asia-Pacific region and the
possibility of its inclusion in the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) will increase, he
said.</P>
      <P>Noting that the ECFA has helped Taiwan break through its diplomatic isolation,
Chao said Taiwan will now be able to actively reach out to the world. Against
this backdrop, he said, the ASEAN countries will find the ARF incomplete without
Taiwan's participation in its security dialogue mechanism.</P>
      <P>The seminar on post-ECFA Taiwan-ASEAN relations, co-sponsored by the MAC and the
Chung-Hua Institution for Economic Research, was attended by scholars and
experts from Taiwan and ASEAN countries, including Thailand, Singapore, the
Philippines and Vietnam.</P>
      <P>Fielding questions from reporters after delivering the opening remarks at the
seminar, Chao said that a cross-strait economic cooperation commission will be
formed after the ECFA takes effect later this year.</P>
      <P>The commission will be headed by a vice ministerial-level economic official and
will deal with matters related to the ECFA, he said.</P>
      <P>On reports that Chen Yunlin, president of the Beijing-based Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) , will defer his plan to visit
Taiwan in September, Chao said the MAC respects any arrangements reached between
ARATS and its Taiwanese counterpart, the Straits Exchange Foundation.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Kaohsiung County Magistrate Yang Chiu-hsing  filed a defamation  suit Thursday
against several environmental activists over an allegation of water pollution
from a giant development project in the southern county.</P>
      <P>Yang, who is running as an independent for mayor of Kaohsiung municipality, said
at a press conference that the E-Da World development project near I-Shou
University in Kaohsiung County is completely legal and compliant with government
regulations.</P>
      <P>Yang said that waste water from the project site is not being channeled into the
Gaoping River -- a major source of drinking water for residents of greater
Kaohsiung -- as the activists have claimed.</P>
      <P>The Kaohsiung county government is monitoring the disposal of water from the
project, he said.</P>
      <P>The sprawling E-Da World project comprises two hotels, an amusement theme park,
a residential complex and a shopping mall.</P>
      <P>The Kaohsiung County government granted licenses to E-Da World only after the
Ministry  of Transportation  and Communications authorized an alteration to the
development plan in May 2009 and approved the environmental impact assessment in
December that year, Yang said.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Water Resources Conservation Alliance accused Yang on Aug. 20 of
covering up for E-Da World, which the alliance alleged has released massive
volumes of waste water into the Gaoping River, polluting Kaohsiung's drinking
water supply.</P>
      <P>"I would not exclude the possibility that certain people have orchestrated this
defamatory accusation because the election is approaching, " said Yang,  who
quit the opposition Democratic Progressive Party to run as an independent after
he lost the party primary.</P>
      <P>After the news conference, Yang's lawyer, Chen Miao-chuan, filed a defamation
suit against Chen Shu-hua, a spokeswoman for the alliance; Lin Li-tsai,
secretary-general of the Taiwan 228 Care Association; and several other people.</P>
      <P>Chen Shu-hua said the alliance challenged Yang and the Kaohsiung county
government after volunteers from the group received complaints from Kaohsiung
residents and went to the site to see for themselves where the waste water was
being discharged.</P>
      <P>The volunteers visited the site four times between Aug. 6 and Aug. 14, she said.</P>
      <P>Yang should apologize and "if he doesn't, we will sue him for defamation," she
said.</P>

      <P>The Taiwanese nine scored three runs at the bottom of the first inning and

      <P>Taiwanese manager Hu Jui-cheng attributed his team's win mainly to its strong
defense, especially starting pitcher Lin Hua-ching, who used heaters and
breaking balls to almost completely block the offense of the Japanese, allowing
only one hit.</P>

      <P>A student from National Taiwan University of Science and Technology (NTUST) has
won a "best of the best" prize in the communication category of the 2010 red dot
design award -- the world's largest and most prestigious  design competition,
the university said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Lee Pei-wen was recognized for her project "Eros, " a 3D animated film about a
battle for life.</P>
      <P>It was the first time that an animated film from Taiwan was chosen as a red dot
"best of the best, " NTUST said.</P>
      <P>The 4-minute film depicts the human gestation process through a video game
setting. The main character, a combat aircraft named "Eros, " is transformed
from a baby who keeps moving inside its mother's womb as it struggles against
various obstacles that could block its birth.</P>
      <P>Lee said her inspiration came from her elder sister's first pregnancy and the
experience of her own mother, who once considered an abortion.</P>
      <P>The obstacles faced by "Eros" during the adventure in the womb symbolize the
various psychological and physical challenges that arise during pregnancy, Lee
said.</P>
      <P>"Eros" is also one of nine works that have been nominated for the "red dot:
junior prize" which comes with a 10,000 euro award. The winner will be announced
Dec. 8.</P>
      <P>The red dot design award is presented by the Design Zentrum Nordrhein Westfalen
in Essen, Germany in three different categories: product design, communication
design and design concept.</P>
      <P>This year's communication design competition drew 6,369 entries from 44
countries, with 610 entries awarded a red dot for their design quality. The
"best of the best" prizes are awarded to particularly outstanding design
achievements, selected from among the red dot winners.</P>
      <P>Besides Lee, four other NTUST students have also won red dot prizes this year.
They are Kao Pei-wen, for "The Color of Mirrors;" Huang Chong-ming, for
"Pimple;" Tsai Yun-chieh,  for "Cafe de L'amour;" and Lu Hsuan-ying, for
"Creation."</P>
      <P>The winning projects will be shown at the red dot design museum on the premises

free trade agreements (FTAs) with Taiwan, a former Japanese economics official
said in an article published Thursday in the Nihon Keizai Shimbun, a Japanese

      <P>The ECFA will help strengthen economic relations and improve bilateral ties

      <P>Pegatron Corp., a manufacturing arm of personal computer vendor AsusTek Computer
Inc., said Thursday it will acquire two electronics component companies based in
China for US$220 million.</P>
      <P>Pegatron's board of directors approved the investment plan to buy 100 percent
ownership of RIH International Ltd. (Samoa), which wholly owns Ri Teng Computer
(Shanghai) and Ri Kuei Precision (Shanghai).</P>
      <P>The two China-based companies produce metal mechanical components for
international notebook computer, tablet PC, e-reader, desktop computer and
monitor brands, Pegatron said in a statement.</P>
      <P>"The investment is an important milestone for Pegatron group's vertical
integration efforts, " spokesman Charles Lin said in the statement, referring to
the company's ambitions to extend its business into upstream component
production from downstream assembly activity.</P>
      <P>Lin said the acquisition is expected to enhance the company's production scale
and manufacturing capability for mechanical parts used in electronic devices.</P>
      <P>The company told the Central News Agency it expects  the acquisition to be
completed by the end of this year, and that it will combine the two Chinese
companies.</P>
      <P>Local media has reported that Pegatron is eyeing potential customers like Apple,
Sony and Hewlett-Packard, as the two Chinese firms are suppliers of components
for products from the electronics giants.</P>
      <P>Pegatron would not directly comment on any specific clients cited in the report,
but said the acquisition is expected to enlarge its customer base.</P>
      <P>Mars Hsu, an analyst with Grand Cathay Securities, said the move is likely to
boost the gross margin of the ODM service provider.</P>
      <P>"The downstream assembly business has been tightly squeezed by fierce
competition," Hsu said. "Once the company steps into component production, its
bottom line will be enhanced accordingly."</P>
      <P>Hsu estimated that the company's gross margin stood at about 4.1 percent in the
second quarter of this year.</P>

institute into a corporation, Chao said the proposed corporation will be
supervised by the Ministry of National Defense but will have its own board of
directors that will determine its operations.</P>
      <P>An administrative corporation is a non-profit corporation set up by the
government to carry out specific public functions, and the bill to transform the
Chung-Shan Institute has already been submitted to the Legislative Yuan for
approval.</P>
      <P>After being transformed into an administrative corporation, Chao said, the
institute will be capable of running as a private corporation,  bringing in
qualified  workers and improving its efficiency.</P>
      <P>The institute, now under the Armaments Bureau of the Ministry of the National
Defense, is manned mainly by military officers with only a few civilian
scientists and technicians.</P>
      <P>After the transformation, the institute will maintain its role as the country's
major developer of defense technology, with the mission of strengthening the
country's defenses and meeting the needs of the armed forces, Chao said.</P>
      <P>The seminar, which drew many industrial leaders, government officials and
scholars, was held to seek public input for the institute's future role as an
administrative corporation.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Magazine digest -- Tough discipline makes Taiwan Taxi industry leader</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Five years after taking over Taiwan Taxi,  C.T.  Lin has successfully  turned a
taxi dispatch company on the brink of bankruptcy into a thriving, modern-managed
enterprise with his unremitting insistence on discipline and outstanding
communication skills.</P>
      <P>Lin, a high school graduate with a telecommunication business background, took
over Taiwan Taxi in 2005 and became its chairman when the company had over 1,200
contracted taxis.</P>
      <P>By improving the standard of the drivers and using business ideas ahead of their
time in the local industry, the company is now the biggest in Taiwan with 9,000
taxis, accounting for more than 10 percent of the 85,000 taxis on Taiwan's
roads.</P>
      <P>Lin Ta-hsuan, one of the company's drivers, said that although C.T. Lin is
tough, he helps bring in more customers and thus increases drivers' income and
attracts more drivers to sign up with him.</P>
      <P>The drivers must adhere to strict rules of conduct such as no smoking or chewing
betel nuts, no listening to underground radio stations and no discussing of
politics or religion with customers. They must also wear a uniform.</P>
      <P>At the moment the company has 68 rules, violations of which can lead to
dismissal or suspension. Every month, about 125 drivers leave the service,
either willingly or after being dismissed.</P>
      <P>With its tough rules and variety of new services, the company helps drivers
adapt by providing frequent training courses and meetings. From January to July
this year, 250 such meetings have been held.</P>
      <P>Other measures include setting up support groups for drivers to quit smoking and
offering subsidies for drivers who are the first to adopt new services.</P>
      <P>The company's latest move to accept credit card payments this year has, like
many previous ideas such as advertisements inside and outside the cars, has
encountered resistance from drivers.</P>
      <P>Although drivers' previous worries about advertisements have been gradually
assuaged thanks to the additional income they generate, C.T. Lin said the
resistance to credit cards is more difficult.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that the benefits of allowing card payments include attracting
foreign visitors and future individual tourists from China, as well as offering
the business opportunity of making taxis into "mobile shops" once the payment
system is established.</P>
      <P>Drivers are opposed to credit card payments mainly because of the 3.5 percent
fee from each transaction plus the discount passengers get with cards issued by
the bank that installs the credit card machine in the car.</P>
      <P>While C.T. Lin remains firm on pushing the new measure, he said his top priority
is finding a place in Taipei County to develop a service park for taxi drivers,
complete with a gas station, auto repair shops, restaurants and recreation
facilities.</P>
      <P>"This is meaningful because it will truly help taxi drivers, " he said.</P>

      <P>The production value of Taiwan's steel sector in the second quarter of this year
rose 17.4 percent from the first quarter on a robust rebound in demand with the
recovery of the global economy, the government said Thursday.</P>
      <P>In the April-June period, the output of the local steel sector totaled NT$366.67
billion (US$11.44 billion), compared with NT$312.4 billion recorded in the first
quarter, according to a report released by the Industry &amp; Technology
Intelligence Services (ITIS), a research institute of the Department of
Industrial Technology under the Ministry of Economic Affairs.</P>
      <P>The output of the second quarter represented a 68.6 percent increase from a year
earlier.</P>
      <P>In the second quarter, Taiwan's exports of steel products saw a rise of 14.4
percent from the first quarter and a gain of 42.9 percent from a year earlier to
total NT$133.44 billion, the report said.</P>
      <P>China, Malaysia and Hong Kong ranked as the top three buyers of Taiwanese steel
products in the second quarter, accounting for 37.3 percent of the total
exports, it said.</P>
      <P>During the same period, Taiwan imported a total of NT$107.12 billion in steel
products, up 25.4 percent from the first quarter and also up 115.9 percent from
a year earlier, the ITIS said.</P>
      <P>According to the research institute, Japan was the largest supplier, accounting
for 39.7 percent of the total imports, followed by China with 24.4 percent and
South Korea with 15 percent.</P>
      <P>The ITIS said that while the pace of the global economic recovery has appeared
slower in the second half of this year, the impact on global steel demand is
expected to be offset in the fourth quarter, a peak season for the steel sector.</P>
      <P>The research institute estimated that the production value of the local steel
sector in 2010 will rise 43 percent from 2009 to NT$1.37 trillion, while steel
product imports are expected to increase 56.0 percent to NT$390.1 billion and
exports might rise 36.5 percent to NT$548 billion.</P>

      <P>The Centers for Disease Control confirmed Thursday the country's first reported
case of dengue fever fatality for this year.</P>
      <P>The victim, a 75-year-old woman from Kaohsiung City in southern Taiwan,
succumbed to the disease Wednesday after being diagnosed Aug. 20 and reported
Aug. 24 to have developed a potentially fatal complication called dengue
hemorrhagic fever, according to CDC Deputy Director-General Chou Chih-hao.</P>
      <P>She was admitted to the hospital's intensive care unit because of a sudden drop
in blood pressure, where she died of myocardial infarction, pneumonia and
multiple organ failure, according to Chou.</P>
      <P>Dengue hemorrhagic fever is caused by a family of viruses that are transmitted
by mosquitoes,  Chou said, adding that people suffering from chronic illnesses
if infected with dengue fever are more likely to develop hemorrhagic fever, Chou
added.</P>
      <P>According to the CDC, the last local death from hemorrhagic dengue fever was
reported in 2009. Since March, 41 cases of confirmed indigenous dengue fever
infection have been reported so far this year, including five new cases reported
Thursday.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's manufacturing industry is conservative in its outlook for the country's
economy in the next six months due to sluggish demand in Europe and a possible
slowdown of demand in China, a local research institute said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The manufacturing companies that were upbeat about Taiwan's economic prospects
for the next six months fell from 34.1 percent in June to 29.4 percent in July,
according to a survey by the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research (TIER).</P>
      <P>"This represents a new low this year, " said Chen Miao, director of the
institute's macroeconomic forecasting center, at a press briefing.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 17.7 percent of manufacturers were pessimistic about the outlook for
that period, compared to 17.2 percent in June, which was a new high this year,
he said.</P>
      <P>Some 52.8 percent believe there will be no change in the economic prospects, a
rise from the 48.7 percent that held that view in June, the survey showed.</P>
      <P>TIER President David Hong forecast that the growth of the manufacturing industry
will slow down on weaker demand in European markets and slower growth in China.</P>
      <P>However, the global economy is expected to continue to grow as the economies of
the U.S., major European countries and Japan continue to improve, he said.</P>
      <P>"In Asia, the emerging economies are still expanding, which will also help drive
the global growth," he said.</P>
      <P>According to the survey, construction companies and developers see a dismal
economic outlook for the next six months, as the central bank recently launched
a measure to rein in residential property prices in Taipei.</P>
      <P>"The trading volume in Taipei in July dropped nearly 10 percent from the
previous month, but prices fell only slightly, " Arisa Liu, an associate
research fellow with the institute, told reporters.</P>
      <P>She said the tight controls maintained by banks on mortgages in the third
quarter of this year and public concerns over high housing prices contributed to
the gloomy outlook.</P>
      <P>Another survey conducted by the institute on the local service industry showed
that wholesalers and retailers were optimistic about the economic outlook as
they were seeing increased turnover.</P>
      <P>In the financial sector, the sentiment was bullish based on the rising stock
market and improving domestic economy, the survey showed.</P>
      <P>Both the tourism sector and the bulk transport industry were neutral about the
economic outlook for the next six months as the number of tourists to Taiwan
began to drop in the low season and there was less demand in China's steel
industry for materials, the institute said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>More investment, jobs needed to close wealth gap: premier</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih said Thursday that the government will continue to boost
private investment and increase job opportunities in order to close the wealth
gap.</P>
      <P>Wu said the government needs to improve the economic structure to address the
wealth gap issue, which has gained urgency recently after the government
announced that the average annual disposable income of Taiwan's top 20 percent
income-earning households was 6. 34 times that of the bottom 20 percent in 2009.</P>
      <P>It was the widest gap since 2001, when the top 20 percent had average disposable
income that was 6.39 times that of the bottom 20 percent.</P>
      <P>"We should continue to boost private investment, expand domestic demand and
strengthen economic momentum in order to create more jobs, lower the jobless
rate and raise salary levels, " Wu said at a Cabinet meeting.</P>
      <P>Although the widening wealth gap could be attributed to the global economic
crunch, Wu went on, closing the wealth gap, as well as improving the income
distribution, are still the government's "unshirkable responsibilities."</P>
      <P>Christina Liu, chairwoman of the Cabinet-level Council for Economic Planning and
Development, said at a press conference after the meeting that Taiwan's wealth
gap is not high if compared to other countries.</P>
      <P>"To solve the wealth gap issue, basically the government just needs to boost
private investment in order to increase jobs, " according to Liu.</P>
      <P>Finance Minister Lee Sush-der said at the meeting that tax breaks will not help
much in closing the wealth gap.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, rich families do not pay less tax, according to the minister,
contradicting what most people believe. Among more than 5 million households,
0.9 percent of them were levied the highest tax rate of 40 percent, and they
accounted for up to 43 percent of the total tax revenues, Lee said.</P>
      <P>About 71 percent of the households were taxed at below 6 percent, representing
only 7 percent of the total tax revenues, he noted.</P>
      <P>Lee also suggested that the government should increase average income by
boosting domestic demand and investment.</P>
      <P>In 2009, Taiwan's average annual disposable income in the richest group of
families reached NT$1.79 million (US$56,113) , compared to NT$282,000 for those
in the poorest bracket, according to the Directorate General of Budget,
Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS).</P>
      <P>The average annual disposable income stood at NT$888,000 per household last
year, or NT$266,000 per household member, representing year-on- year declines of
2.9 percent and 2.6 percent, respectively, the DGBAS said.</P>

physician at the hospital's Family Medicine Department.</P>
      <P>Under the supervision of dieticians, the participants kept careful records of

      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih hailed Thursday the surrender of a shooting suspect in a
high-profile gangland murder in central Taiwan's Taichung City in May, saying
the development marks progress in a government crime-fighting campaign.</P>
      <P>With the surrender of Liao Kuo-hau, the 18-year-old allegedly responsible for
shooting gang kingpin Weng Chi-nan to death at Weng's office in Taichung May 28,
all of the key suspects in the case have now been taken into custody.</P>
      <P>Among those previously arrested are Lin Ying-hao, who allegedly drove Liao to
and from Weng's office on the day of the crime, and Yang Ting-jung, a Taichung-
based gangster suspected of being the mastermind behind Weng's murder.</P>
      <P>Wu said Liao's surrender will help police get to the bottom of the case.</P>
      <P>The case ignited a public outcry, as it was later discovered that four police
officers were at the scene playing mahjong, but failed to intervene. The
incident prompted the government to launch a new crime-fighting program
codenamed "Operation Thunder" to crack down on gang-related activity. The police
authorities also vowed to institute better discipline in the force.</P>
      <P>Minister of the Interior Jiang Yi-huah said Thursday that he hopes the solving
of the case will help restore public confidence and trust in the police force.</P>
      <P>Given the complexity of the case -- as evidenced in the careful planning of the
supply of the murder weapons, as well as the transporting and hiding of the
suspected murderer, Jiang said it is commendable that the law enforcement
authorities have managed to make such progress in less than three months.</P>
      <P>As Liao committed the murder three weeks before he turned 18, he will be
transferred to the juvenile court after the police inquiry is completed.
Nevertheless, the court is likely to refer his case to the Taichung Prosecutors
Office for further investigation because the crime he committed is a felony
subject to a prison term of more than five years, legal sources said.</P>
      <P>In an interrogation session that same day, Liao told police that after murdering
Weng, he was driven to neighboring Taichung County. In the car, he disassembled
the two guns used in the shooting and discarded the parts along the way. He
guided the police on a search Thursday, but they found nothing.</P>
      <P>Minister of Justice Tseng Yung-fu said he had asked the relevant authorities to
thoroughly probe the details of the case, including the weapons used, as well as
to bring everyone involved to justice.</P>

      <P>U.S. prosecutors and officials have recently  visited Taiwan for discussions
with their Taiwanese counterparts on issues related to U.S. civil forfeiture
complaints against properties owned by former President Chen Shui-bian and his
wife in New York and Virginia, a local prosecutor said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The U.S. government filed the complaints in July seeking to expropriate the
properties owned by Chen and former first lady Wu Shu-chen, which were allegedly
bought with bribe money the couple took when Chen was in power between 2001 and
2008.</P>
      <P>Chen Hung-ta, chief of the Special Prosecutors Division under the Supreme
Prosecutors Office, said the U.S. authorities are empowered by the laws of that
country to confiscate the properties, without the need to wait until the trial
of the former first couple is completed in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen and Wu were both sentenced to life in prison and fines of NT$200 million
(US$6.23 million) and NT$300 million, respectively, in September last year on
charges of taking bribes, money laundering and forgery.</P>
      <P>They both appealed and had their sentences reduced to 20 years and their fines
cut to NT$170  million  and NT$200  million, respectively, June 11. Both
prosecutors and the couple appealed the new sentences.</P>
      <P>Chen Hung-ta said, however, that local and U.S. officials have not touched on
the issue of how the properties, if confiscated, should be distributed between
the two countries.</P>
      <P>Chen Chih-chung, the ex-president's son, has argued that the U.S. government's
civil forfeiture complaints against properties owned by his parents were
"illogical, " claiming that they were procured with money from "political
contributions donated to his farther."</P>
      <P>According to the complaints filed in New York and Virginia, Taiwan's Yuanta
Securities Co. paid a bribe of NT$200 million between 2005 and 2006 to Wu to
ensure that Chen's administration would not interfere with its bid to acquire
additional shares in Fuhwa Financial Co.</P>
      <P>The complaints go on to say that Wu laundered the bribe money using shell
companies and Swiss bank accounts controlled by her son Chen Chih-chung and his
wife Huang Jui-ching. Some of the money was transferred to the United States and
used to buy a condominium in Manhattan and a house in Keswick, Virginia, the
complaints say.</P>
      <P>It was the second time the U.S. had sent officials to Taiwan for the
investigations into Chen Shui-bian. A team of U.S. judicial affairs officials
visited last year to discuss the issue with local prosecutors and Foreign
Ministry officials.</P>

14 weekly flights between Taipei's Songshan Airport and Shanghai's Hongqiao

      <P>After the disputes were resolved in a new round of talks held early this month,
however, the Taiwanese carriers came up with new applications last week, CAA
officials said.</P>
      <P>The planned extra flights include four to Beijing, four to Shenzhen, 15 to
Fuzhou and Xiamen, two to Qingdao, two to Guangzhou and one to Changsha from
Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport; three to Fuzhou from Taichung Airport; two
to Fuzhou, one to Xiamen and one to Guangzhou from Kaohsiung Airport; and one to
Guangzhou from Songshan.</P>
      <P>A CAA official said the General Administration of Civil Aviation of China had
already referred the Taiwanese carriers' flight plans to its local branches to
allocate takeoff and landing times.</P>
      <P>"It remains unclear whether our carriers will all be able to obtain ideal
schedules, " said the CAA official. "Even if they can acquire landing and
takeoff times, they will need 10 days to two weeks to prepare for opening the
extra flights, so they are not expected to take off until mid-September."</P>
      <P>Chinese carriers have also filed applications with the CAA for operating extra
flights, but the CAA had yet to approve any of them. Basically, however, the
official said, the carriers from both sides will inaugurate their extra flights
at roughly the same time.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Five years after taking over Taiwan Taxi,  C.T.  Lin has successfully  turned a
taxi dispatch company on the brink of bankruptcy into a thriving, modern-managed
enterprise with his unremitting insistence on discipline and outstanding
communication skills.</P>
      <P>Lin, a high school graduate with a telecommunication business background, took
over Taiwan Taxi in 2005 and became its chairman when the company had over 1,200
contracted taxis.</P>
      <P>By improving the standard of the drivers and using business ideas ahead of their
time in the local industry, the company is now the biggest in Taiwan with 9,000
taxis, accounting for more than 10 percent of the 85,000 taxis on Taiwan's
roads.</P>
      <P>Lin Ta-hsuan, one of the company's drivers, said that although C.T. Lin is
tough, he helps bring in more customers and thus increases drivers' income and
attracts more drivers to sign up with him.</P>
      <P>The drivers must adhere to strict rules of conduct such as no smoking or chewing
betel nuts, no listening to underground radio stations and no discussing of
politics or religion with customers. They must also wear a uniform.</P>
      <P>At the moment the company has 68 rules, violations of which can lead to
dismissal or suspension. Every month, about 125 drivers leave the service,
either willingly or after being dismissed.</P>
      <P>With its tough rules and variety of new services, the company helps drivers
adapt by providing frequent training courses and meetings. From January to July
this year, 250 such meetings have been held.</P>
      <P>Other measures include setting up support groups for drivers to quit smoking and
offering subsidies for drivers who are the first to adopt new services.</P>
      <P>The company's latest move to accept credit card payments this year has, like
many previous ideas such as advertisements inside and outside the cars, has
encountered resistance from drivers.</P>
      <P>Although drivers' previous worries about advertisements have been gradually
assuaged thanks to the additional income they generate, C.T. Lin said the
resistance to credit cards is more difficult.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that the benefits of allowing card payments include attracting
foreign visitors and future individual tourists from China, as well as offering
the business opportunity of making taxis into "mobile shops" once the payment
system is established.</P>
      <P>Drivers are opposed to credit card payments mainly because of the 3.5 percent
fee from each transaction plus the discount passengers get with cards issued by
the bank that installs the credit card machine in the car.</P>
      <P>While C.T. Lin remains firm on pushing the new measure, he said his top priority
is finding a place in Taipei County to develop a service park for taxi drivers,
complete with a gas station, auto repair shops, restaurants and recreation
facilities.</P>
      <P>"This is meaningful because it will truly help taxi drivers, " he said.</P>

      <P>The production value of Taiwan's steel sector in the second quarter of this year
rose 17.4 percent from the first quarter on a robust rebound in demand with the
recovery of the global economy, the government said Thursday.</P>
      <P>In the April-June period, the output of the local steel sector totaled NT$366.67
billion (US$11.44 billion), compared with NT$312.4 billion recorded in the first
quarter, according to a report released by the Industry &amp; Technology
Intelligence Services (ITIS), a research institute of the Department of
Industrial Technology under the Ministry of Economic Affairs.</P>
      <P>The output of the second quarter represented a 68.6 percent increase from a year
earlier.</P>
      <P>In the second quarter, Taiwan's exports of steel products saw a rise of 14.4
percent from the first quarter and a gain of 42.9 percent from a year earlier to
total NT$133.44 billion, the report said.</P>
      <P>China, Malaysia and Hong Kong ranked as the top three buyers of Taiwanese steel
products in the second quarter, accounting for 37.3 percent of the total
exports, it said.</P>
      <P>During the same period, Taiwan imported a total of NT$107.12 billion in steel
products, up 25.4 percent from the first quarter and also up 115.9 percent from
a year earlier, the ITIS said.</P>
      <P>According to the research institute, Japan was the largest supplier, accounting
for 39.7 percent of the total imports, followed by China with 24.4 percent and
South Korea with 15 percent.</P>
      <P>The ITIS said that while the pace of the global economic recovery has appeared
slower in the second half of this year, the impact on global steel demand is
expected to be offset in the fourth quarter, a peak season for the steel sector.</P>
      <P>The research institute estimated that the production value of the local steel
sector in 2010 will rise 43 percent from 2009 to NT$1.37 trillion, while steel
product imports are expected to increase 56.0 percent to NT$390.1 billion and
exports might rise 36.5 percent to NT$548 billion.</P>

      <P>The Centers for Disease Control confirmed Thursday the country's first reported
case of dengue fever fatality for this year.</P>
      <P>The victim, a 75-year-old woman from Kaohsiung City in southern Taiwan,
succumbed to the disease Wednesday after being diagnosed Aug. 20 and reported
Aug. 24 to have developed a potentially fatal complication called dengue
hemorrhagic fever, according to CDC Deputy Director-General Chou Chih-hao.</P>
      <P>She was admitted to the hospital's intensive care unit because of a sudden drop
in blood pressure, where she died of myocardial infarction, pneumonia and
multiple organ failure, according to Chou.</P>
      <P>Dengue hemorrhagic fever is caused by a family of viruses that are transmitted
by mosquitoes,  Chou said, adding that people suffering from chronic illnesses
if infected with dengue fever are more likely to develop hemorrhagic fever, Chou
added.</P>
      <P>According to the CDC, the last local death from hemorrhagic dengue fever was
reported in 2009. Since March, 41 cases of confirmed indigenous dengue fever
infection have been reported so far this year, including five new cases reported

      <P>Taiwan's manufacturing industry is conservative in its outlook for the country's
economy in the next six months due to sluggish demand in Europe and a possible
slowdown of demand in China, a local research institute said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The manufacturing companies that were upbeat about Taiwan's economic prospects
for the next six months fell from 34.1 percent in June to 29.4 percent in July,
according to a survey by the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research (TIER).</P>
      <P>"This represents a new low this year, " said Chen Miao, director of the
institute's macroeconomic forecasting center, at a press briefing.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 17.7 percent of manufacturers were pessimistic about the outlook for
that period, compared to 17.2 percent in June, which was a new high this year,
he said.</P>
      <P>Some 52.8 percent believe there will be no change in the economic prospects, a
rise from the 48.7 percent that held that view in June, the survey showed.</P>
      <P>TIER President David Hong forecast that the growth of the manufacturing industry
will slow down on weaker demand in European markets and slower growth in China.</P>
      <P>However, the global economy is expected to continue to grow as the economies of
the U.S., major European countries and Japan continue to improve, he said.</P>
      <P>"In Asia, the emerging economies are still expanding, which will also help drive
the global growth," he said.</P>
      <P>According to the survey, construction companies and developers see a dismal
economic outlook for the next six months, as the central bank recently launched
a measure to rein in residential property prices in Taipei.</P>
      <P>"The trading volume in Taipei in July dropped nearly 10 percent from the
previous month, but prices fell only slightly, " Arisa Liu, an associate
research fellow with the institute, told reporters.</P>
      <P>She said the tight controls maintained by banks on mortgages in the third
quarter of this year and public concerns over high housing prices contributed to
the gloomy outlook.</P>
      <P>Another survey conducted by the institute on the local service industry showed
that wholesalers and retailers were optimistic about the economic outlook as
they were seeing increased turnover.</P>
      <P>In the financial sector, the sentiment was bullish based on the rising stock
market and improving domestic economy, the survey showed.</P>
      <P>Both the tourism sector and the bulk transport industry were neutral about the
economic outlook for the next six months as the number of tourists to Taiwan
began to drop in the low season and there was less demand in China's steel
industry for materials, the institute said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih said Thursday that the government will continue to boost
private investment and increase job opportunities in order to close the wealth
gap.</P>
      <P>Wu said the government needs to improve the economic structure to address the
wealth gap issue, which has gained urgency recently after the government
announced that the average annual disposable income of Taiwan's top 20 percent
income-earning households was 6. 34 times that of the bottom 20 percent in 2009.</P>
      <P>It was the widest gap since 2001, when the top 20 percent had average disposable
income that was 6.39 times that of the bottom 20 percent.</P>
      <P>"We should continue to boost private investment, expand domestic demand and
strengthen economic momentum in order to create more jobs, lower the jobless
rate and raise salary levels, " Wu said at a Cabinet meeting.</P>
      <P>Although the widening wealth gap could be attributed to the global economic
crunch, Wu went on, closing the wealth gap, as well as improving the income
distribution, are still the government's "unshirkable responsibilities."</P>
      <P>Christina Liu, chairwoman of the Cabinet-level Council for Economic Planning and
Development, said at a press conference after the meeting that Taiwan's wealth
gap is not high if compared to other countries.</P>
      <P>"To solve the wealth gap issue, basically the government just needs to boost
private investment in order to increase jobs, " according to Liu.</P>
      <P>Finance Minister Lee Sush-der said at the meeting that tax breaks will not help
much in closing the wealth gap.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, rich families do not pay less tax, according to the minister,
contradicting what most people believe. Among more than 5 million households,
0.9 percent of them were levied the highest tax rate of 40 percent, and they
accounted for up to 43 percent of the total tax revenues, Lee said.</P>
      <P>About 71 percent of the households were taxed at below 6 percent, representing
only 7 percent of the total tax revenues, he noted.</P>
      <P>Lee also suggested that the government should increase average income by
boosting domestic demand and investment.</P>
      <P>In 2009, Taiwan's average annual disposable income in the richest group of
families reached NT$1.79 million (US$56,113) , compared to NT$282,000 for those
in the poorest bracket, according to the Directorate General of Budget,
Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS).</P>
      <P>The average annual disposable income stood at NT$888,000 per household last
year, or NT$266,000 per household member, representing year-on- year declines of
2.9 percent and 2.6 percent, respectively, the DGBAS said.</P>

      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih hailed Thursday the surrender of a shooting suspect in a
high-profile gangland murder in central Taiwan's Taichung City in May, saying
the development marks progress in a government crime-fighting campaign.</P>
      <P>With the surrender of Liao Kuo-hau, the 18-year-old allegedly responsible for
shooting gang kingpin Weng Chi-nan to death at Weng's office in Taichung May 28,
all of the key suspects in the case have now been taken into custody.</P>
      <P>Among those previously arrested are Lin Ying-hao, who allegedly drove Liao to
and from Weng's office on the day of the crime, and Yang Ting-jung, a Taichung-
based gangster suspected of being the mastermind behind Weng's murder.</P>
      <P>Wu said Liao's surrender will help police get to the bottom of the case.</P>
      <P>The case ignited a public outcry, as it was later discovered that four police
officers were at the scene playing mahjong, but failed to intervene. The
incident prompted the government to launch a new crime-fighting program
codenamed "Operation Thunder" to crack down on gang-related activity. The police
authorities also vowed to institute better discipline in the force.</P>
      <P>Minister of the Interior Jiang Yi-huah said Thursday that he hopes the solving
of the case will help restore public confidence and trust in the police force.</P>
      <P>Given the complexity of the case -- as evidenced in the careful planning of the
supply of the murder weapons, as well as the transporting and hiding of the
suspected murderer, Jiang said it is commendable that the law enforcement
authorities have managed to make such progress in less than three months.</P>
      <P>As Liao committed the murder three weeks before he turned 18, he will be
transferred to the juvenile court after the police inquiry is completed.
Nevertheless, the court is likely to refer his case to the Taichung Prosecutors
Office for further investigation because the crime he committed is a felony
subject to a prison term of more than five years, legal sources said.</P>
      <P>In an interrogation session that same day, Liao told police that after murdering
Weng, he was driven to neighboring Taichung County. In the car, he disassembled
the two guns used in the shooting and discarded the parts along the way. He
guided the police on a search Thursday, but they found nothing.</P>
      <P>Minister of Justice Tseng Yung-fu said he had asked the relevant authorities to
thoroughly probe the details of the case, including the weapons used, as well as
to bring everyone involved to justice.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>U.S. prosecutors and officials have recently  visited Taiwan for discussions
with their Taiwanese counterparts on issues related to U.S. civil forfeiture
complaints against properties owned by former President Chen Shui-bian and his
wife in New York and Virginia, a local prosecutor said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The U.S. government filed the complaints in July seeking to expropriate the
properties owned by Chen and former first lady Wu Shu-chen, which were allegedly
bought with bribe money the couple took when Chen was in power between 2001 and
2008.</P>
      <P>Chen Hung-ta, chief of the Special Prosecutors Division under the Supreme
Prosecutors Office, said the U.S. authorities are empowered by the laws of that
country to confiscate the properties, without the need to wait until the trial
of the former first couple is completed in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen and Wu were both sentenced to life in prison and fines of NT$200 million
(US$6.23 million) and NT$300 million, respectively, in September last year on
charges of taking bribes, money laundering and forgery.</P>
      <P>They both appealed and had their sentences reduced to 20 years and their fines
cut to NT$170  million  and NT$200  million, respectively, June 11. Both
prosecutors and the couple appealed the new sentences.</P>
      <P>Chen Hung-ta said, however, that local and U.S. officials have not touched on
the issue of how the properties, if confiscated, should be distributed between
the two countries.</P>
      <P>Chen Chih-chung, the ex-president's son, has argued that the U.S. government's
civil forfeiture complaints against properties owned by his parents were
"illogical, " claiming that they were procured with money from "political
contributions donated to his farther."</P>
      <P>According to the complaints filed in New York and Virginia, Taiwan's Yuanta
Securities Co. paid a bribe of NT$200 million between 2005 and 2006 to Wu to
ensure that Chen's administration would not interfere with its bid to acquire
additional shares in Fuhwa Financial Co.</P>
      <P>The complaints go on to say that Wu laundered the bribe money using shell
companies and Swiss bank accounts controlled by her son Chen Chih-chung and his
wife Huang Jui-ching. Some of the money was transferred to the United States and
used to buy a condominium in Manhattan and a house in Keswick, Virginia, the
complaints say.</P>
      <P>It was the second time the U.S. had sent officials to Taiwan for the
investigations into Chen Shui-bian. A team of U.S. judicial affairs officials
visited last year to discuss the issue with local prosecutors and Foreign
Ministry officials.</P>

      <P>Taiwanese and Chinese airlines have applied to open additional direct flights
across the Taiwan Strait, but none of them are expected to be inaugurated before
mid-September, the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and China agreed in May to allow airlines from each side to offer 50 more
direct cross-strait flights per week and carriers from each side smoothly opened
14 weekly flights between Taipei's Songshan Airport and Shanghai's Hongqiao
Airport June 14.</P>
      <P>The remaining quotas have so far not been used because of disputes about flight
destinations and inconvenient scheduling given to local carriers by China's
civil aviation authorities.</P>
      <P>After the disputes were resolved in a new round of talks held early this month,
however, the Taiwanese carriers came up with new applications last week, CAA
officials said.</P>
      <P>The planned extra flights include four to Beijing, four to Shenzhen, 15 to
Fuzhou and Xiamen, two to Qingdao, two to Guangzhou and one to Changsha from
Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport; three to Fuzhou from Taichung Airport; two
to Fuzhou, one to Xiamen and one to Guangzhou from Kaohsiung Airport; and one to
Guangzhou from Songshan.</P>
      <P>A CAA official said the General Administration of Civil Aviation of China had
already referred the Taiwanese carriers' flight plans to its local branches to
allocate takeoff and landing times.</P>
      <P>"It remains unclear whether our carriers will all be able to obtain ideal
schedules, " said the CAA official. "Even if they can acquire landing and
takeoff times, they will need 10 days to two weeks to prepare for opening the
extra flights, so they are not expected to take off until mid-September."</P>
      <P>Chinese carriers have also filed applications with the CAA for operating extra
flights, but the CAA had yet to approve any of them. Basically, however, the
official said, the carriers from both sides will inaugurate their extra flights
at roughly the same time.</P>

      <P>Liao Kuo-hao had not yet turned 18 when he gunned down Taichung gang leader Weng
Chi-nan in May. Upon finally turning himself in to the police two days ago, Liao
complained that he is a victim of Taiwan's education system.</P>
      <P>Liao was a low-performing student academically, but he was good at sports. Not
every kid is good at studying, and helping students like Liao find their fields
of interest and develop their strengths is perhaps what schools can do for them.</P>
      <P>However, without family support, what the students do after school is probably
beyond the reach of their teachers.</P>
      <P>Liao's mother abandoned him when he was very young and his father, a drug addict
who was in and out of jail, was only 16 when he became a father and was too
immature to raise a child.</P>
      <P>However, the boy himself has a responsibility to shoulder as well and cannot put
all the blame on society and education. Among those children who come from
similar environments and backgrounds, there are some who are willing to be
responsible for themselves, overcome their plights and live a different life.

    <HEADLINE>Talk of the day -- Cross-strait investment enters new stage</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>08/27/10  11:23:33
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The first restaurant wholly owned by a China-based business group is scheduled
to open in Taipei early next month, while Taiwan's government-run New Labor
Pension Fund has decided to invest in the Chinese stock market soon for the
first time.</P>
      <P>These moves signal that investment activities and capital flow across the Taiwan
Strait will enter a new stage amid growing cross-strait reconciliation,
particularly in the wake of the signing of a landmark economic cooperation
framework agreement in June.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from local media coverage of the new developments:</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>The Yechun Teahouse, a famous "century-old-brand" restaurant in the eastern
Chinese city of Yangzhou, will open its first overseas branch at Core Pacific
City Living Mall in Taipei Sept. 3.</P>
      <P>It will be the first Chinese fully owned restaurant in Taiwan and its owner, the
Yangzijiang Group, attaches great importance to the venture. It has spent NT$40
million (US$1.25 million) to decorate its 500-ping (1,650-square meter) property
into a classic Yangzhou-style setting.</P>
      <P>Not only have wood craftsmen been hired from Yangzhou to carry out the interior
decoration but the parent restaurant's head chef will stay in Taiwan for the
first year of operation to ensure that the restaurant's dishes exactly match
those sold at the Yangzhou outlet.</P>
      <P>"The decorations, tableware and utensils used in the Taiwan branch all come from
the original Yechun Teahouse. We want to present authentic Yangzhou-style
gourmet offerings to win the hearts and minds of Taiwanese customers, " said
Yangzijiang Group Chairman Zhu Yuanhao in a recent interview.</P>
      <P>The restaurant will offer Yechun's signature dishes, including steamed buns,
meat dumplings, green shao-mai, steamed thousand layer cakes and other
quintessential  Yangzhou  delicacies.  All the ingredients will be Taiwan-grown
farm produce.</P>
      <P>Because of legal restrictions, Chinese catering service providers previously had
to collaborate with Taiwanese joint-venture partners when operating in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Divergences in marketing, packaging and management concepts led to the failure
of those pioneering Chinese investors in the highly competitive Taiwanese
catering industry and market analysts in Taiwan and China are now watching
closely to see whether Yechun's new business venture will succeed. (Aug. 27,
2010).</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Labor Pension Fund Supervisory  Committee  decided recently that it
will earmark NT$24 billion from the New Labor Pension Fund for investment in
emerging stock markets, including those in China, as well as Russia, Brazil,
India, South Africa, Malaysia, Thailand and Latin American countries.</P>
      <P>It marks the first time that the New Labor Pension Fund will be used to invest
in emerging stock markets and also the first time that the government-run
pension fund will invest in the Chinese stock market.</P>
      <P>China's B-shares and H-shares (shares of companies incorporated in China that
are listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange or other foreign exchanges) will all
be targets of the labor pension fund's investment, according to Lee Jui-chu,
vice chairwoman of the Labor Pension Fund Supervisory Committee.</P>
      <P>Basically, she said, B-shares -- which refer to those traded in foreign
currencies on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges -- will account for no
more than 10 percent of the fund's total investment in these emerging stock
markets.</P>
      <P>As of the end of July, the earnings rate or return on investment of the old
Retirement Fund was minus 1.17 percent, which translates into a loss of NT$5.9
billion, while the earnings rate of the New Pension Fund was negative 1.49
percent, representing a loss of NT$7.5 billion, Lee said.</P>
      <P>In comparison, she said, the two pension funds rank among the world's best in
terms of management efficiency and profitability. "The losses of both funds are
narrowing steadily, " she added. (Aug. 27, 2010).</P>

      <P>With direct flights between Songshan Airport in Taipei and Haneda Airport in
Tokyo set to begin Oct. 31, Taiwanese travel agencies are planning to launch
luxury tours to Japan via the flights, with a 33-day vacation priced at a
whopping NT$1.25 million (US$39,000).</P>
      <P>EzTravel Co., a leading local online travel agency, announced Thursday at a
press conference that it will start to sell the top Japan travel package online
-- with only 20 places available -- from Sept. 9.</P>
      <P>Jack You, chief executive officer of ezTravel Co., said the tourists will travel
business class on All Nippon Airways (ANA) and first class on the Shinkansen,
Japan's high-speed railway, to 26 destinations in Japan.</P>
      <P>Miya Shinsuke, head of ANA's Taiwan branch office, said that as Haneda Airport
is ANA's major base for domestic flights, it will be easier for the airline to
plan tours in Japan from that airport compared to Japan's other main gateway,
Narita International Airport.</P>
      <P>He was upbeat that the top-class tour will attract attention in Japan, as such
tours have been rarely been seen, and he predicted that Japanese travel agencies
might follow suit in designing similar packages.</P>
      <P>The tourists on the one-month luxury tour will stay at top hotels with an
average room rate of NT$26,000 per night, which would bring the total
accommodation cost of the tour to NT$800,000, according to the online travel
agency.</P>
      <P>The Taiwanese online travel agency has been successful in launching various
luxury vacations since the economy has recovered. In April, it sold out all 40
seats for a NT$2.25 million 60-day world tour.</P>
      <P>Lion Travel Service Co., one of Taiwan's largest travel agencies, also said the
Songshan-Haneda flights will provide more flexibility for planning top tours in
Japan.</P>
      <P>The company is also planning to launch top-level tours to Tokyo and Kyoto, with
a seven-day tour priced at NT$300,000.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Besides buying luxury residences, exquisite products and high-end cars, wealthy
people in Taiwan should think more about "what are the things that are more
important than money?"</P>
      <P>In this regard, has "The Giving Pledge" philanthropic campaign initiated by
American billionaires Warren Buffett and Bill Gates given them any inspiration?</P>
      <P>Addressing the widening gap between the rich and the poor, Premier Wu Den-yih
has said he hopes to collect more taxes from high-income earners and to use the
money to help the disadvantaged. In reality, we have not seen the Cabinet carry
out this policy.</P>
      <P>Over the past year, many proposals to increase taxes have been put aside by the
government because "the timing is not right." Instead, many proposals to cut
taxes have been adopted.</P>
      <P>Rich people in Taiwan like to talk about their achievements and those in the
business sector also like to tout their contributions to society. However, when
it comes to raising taxes to save state finances, they immediately broadcast
their displeasure.</P>
      <P>We look forward to seeing the emergence of generous entrepreneurs like Buffett
and Gates in Taiwan, people who are not only rich in wealth but also in
benevolence. (Editorial abstract -- Aug. 27, 2010)</P>

      <P>An Argentinean student has recently received a music scholarship from the Taiwan
Catholic Mission Foundation, diplomatic sources said Friday.</P>
      <P>The foundation began to offer the Lito Gonzalez Music Scholarship to Argentine
students two years ago. This year's recipient was Emiliano Quinonez, a 16-year-
old student from the Berisso school's orchestra in La Plata, the capital city of
Buenos Aires Province, the sources said, adding that the scholarship will allow
the student to pursue advanced training.</P>
      <P>The scholarship award ceremony took place Aug. 19 at Taiwan's representative
office in Argentina, with Dr. Austin Ou, director of the foundation and Lee
Sing-ying, head of the Taipei Commercial and Cultural Office in Argentina,
presiding over the ceremony.</P>
      <P>With the financial aid from the foundation, Cynthia Gomez, the recipient of last
year's scholarship, has performed violin recitals in both France and Venezuela,
the sources said.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Catholic Mission Foundation, founded in 1997, has served the needy
worldwide by carrying out medical and educational programs to improve their
quality of life.</P>
      <P>In addition to the scholarship program, the foundation also operates a study

      <P>Taiwan officially became a full member of the Inter-American Tropical Tuna
Commission (IATTC) Friday, which entitles it to vote in the commission's policy-
making process and gives a boost to the rights of Taiwanese fishermen, the
Council of Agricultural Affairs (COA) announced Friday.</P>
      <P>At a time when international management of tuna stocks has become increasingly
restrictive, Taiwan's full membership of the IATTC is very helpful in protecting
Taiwanese fishing boats operating on the high seas, the COA's Fisheries Agency
explained.</P>
      <P>The IATTC is in charge of the management and conservation of tuna in the East
Pacific, an important fishing ground for high-value species such as bigeye and
yellowfin tuna for Taiwanese fishing vessels.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has been an IATTC observer since 1973, but this status did not confer
voting rights.</P>
      <P>In the peak tuna years, more than 90 Taiwanese fishing ships operated in the
East Pacific, yielding an average combined annual catch of 10,000-20,000  tons
worth some NT$2 billion (US$62.5 million).</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A Taiwanese-American couple have recently returned from a daring 82-day,
41,843-km round-the-globe flight, becoming the first people of Chinese descent
in history to successfully fly a single-engine aircraft around the world.</P>
      <P>Jeffrey Ying and his wife Renee Chen departed Los Angeles May 4 aboard their
single-engine Piper PA 46, heading north to Canada where they embarked on their
epic global flight, returning to Los Angeles July 20 safe and sound.</P>
      <P>Ying, who participated in the design and building of Taiwan's first self-made
aircraft in the 1980s, told CNA that flying around the world had always been his
dream, but it was only some 10 years ago that he began to work toward realizing
that goal.</P>
      <P>He said it was not until he actually started making the preparations for the
trip that he realized how hard it is to fly around the world.</P>
      <P>"I had a bumpy start with my first two aircraft, but managed to lead the
endeavor back onto the right track after I obtained a third plane two years
ago," he said.</P>
      <P>By the time he and his wife were ready to kick off the flight, however, he
realized that buying the aircraft was the easiest part of the round-the-globe
project.</P>
      <P>Charting flight plans, obtaining landing permits from the many airports they
would need to use,  and fly-over  permits from governments in advance, as well
as refueling, were the major issues that had to be surmounted, he added.</P>
      <P>Those "human" matters, however, were nothing compared to what happens in the
sky, he said.</P>
      <P>"The weather issue was the biggest enemy for us," he went on.</P>
      <P>Soon after they reached Iceland, they were stuck there by a massive ash cloud
from a volcanic eruption in that tiny country, which caused chaos across Europe
after all flights over the United Kingdom were canceled.</P>
      <P>"Believing that getting stuck at London's Heathrow Airport was definitely not an
option, we wandered from one small airport to another around Scandinavia, trying
to inch our way south toward Africa, " Ying recalled.</P>
      <P>They experienced another life-or-death challenge one day while flying from
Brunei to Cambodia. Caught in a tremendous thunderstorm, all three radar and
navigation systems on the aircraft became inoperable and it was only Ying's
instinct and experience that got them down safely.</P>
      <P>"We basically collapsed into our seats once we landed in Cambodia," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Ying said that despite their adversities, they were helped along the way by many
kind-hearted people.</P>
      <P>On the day they arrived at the Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport at midnight
running on fumes, for example, they found to their horror that they did not have
enough Taiwanese currency to pay for their fuel.</P>
      <P>To their eternal gratitude, China Airlines ground staff had a whip-round and
raised the money to pay for their gas.</P>
      <P>Ying became the 166th pilot in the world to fly a single-engine plane around the
world. He and his wife recorded their journey with more than 3,000 photographs
taken in the 26 countries they visited.</P>

      <P>Boosted by strong buying in construction shares, Taiwan share prices closed up
0.43 percent Friday, recovering slightly from losses in the previous two days,
dealers said.</P>
      <P>The weighted index rose 33.17 points to 7,722.91, after moving between 7,702.59
and 7,722.91, on turnover of NT$92.1 billion (US$2.88 billion).</P>
      <P>The market opened up 12.85 points, with investors more reluctant to continue to
dump shares as the market found technical support after two days of correction,
dealers said.</P>
      <P>The construction sector, which gained the most at 2.7 percent, was boosted by a
forecast by Credit Suisse research analyst Tao Dong that Taipei's real estate
market will certainly go up.</P>
      <P>Textile stocks rose 1.4 percent, and the foodstuff sector added 1.3 percent
after suffering a 2.4 percent decline on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Financial shares were up 0.9 percent, plastics and chemical issues advanced 0.7
percent, and paper and pulp shares rose 0.6 percent.</P>
      <P>The machinery and electronics sector edged up 0.1 percent, while cement stocks
remained unchanged.</P>
      <P>A total of 1,780 stocks closed down and 1,683 finished higher, while 333
remained unchanged.</P>
      <P>Allan Lin, assistant vice president of the research department at Concord
Securities, said that the local shares market, after falling in the past two
days, was shored up by bargain hunting buying, but it also encountered
resistance as it rose.</P>
      <P>Lin said he expects the market to enter a narrow consolidation phase, with the
index hovering between 7,650 and 7,850 next week.</P>
      <P>Taiwan International Securities analyst Benson Huang said that the market was
still a bit bearish as foreign investors have turned to the sell side in the
stock futures market.</P>
      <P>He also said that the market mood was cautious ahead of the latest GDP figures
from the U.S. and a speech by Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke later Friday
on the U.S. economic outlook.</P>
      <P>"The index would need to stand firm above the 90-day-average of 7,655 next week
if it is to move upward," Huang said.</P>
      <P>Kevin Lin, senior vice president of Fuh Hong Financial Planning Co., predicted
that market investors will grow more cautious with the approach of November 27
municipal  mayoral elections  and the uncertainties over the U.S. and European
economies.</P>
      <P>"Local investors usually begin to turn cautious three months before an
election," Lin said.</P>
      <P>Foreign investors, including mainland Chinese investors, were net sellers of
NT$5.93 billion-worth of shares.</P>

      <P>Representatives of Taiwan electronics companies and government agencies will
launch a recruitment drive in Boston, Massachusetts next month to hire overseas
Taiwanese for jobs in the fields of business, education and research.</P>
      <P>The delegation, led by Minister without Portfolio Chang Jin-fu and Chairwoman
Christina Liu from the Council for Economic Planning and Development, will
conduct one-on-one interviews with eligible people on Sept. 15.</P>
      <P>The  participating  companies  and  academic  and  research institutions are
expected to offer a total of 1,000 positions in Taiwan, China and the U.S. under
the Taiwan government's Overseas Science and Technology Personnel Recruitment
Program.</P>
      <P>The delegation  consists of major Taiwan-based  electronics companies such as
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) , Foxconn Technology Group,
Mediateck, Delta Electronics and Chimei Innolux Corporation as well as
U.S.-based Taiwanese companies like AcBel Polytech and the Aurora Group.</P>
      <P>Because of expansion, Taiwan electronic companies have been experiencing a
shortage of skilled technicians in LED and solar- production industry. They will
be looking to fill the shortfall at the job fair.</P>
      <P>In the field of education, National Cheng Kung University, National Chiao Tung
University, National Yang Ming University, and China Medical University will be
aiming to recruit teaching staff.</P>
      <P>Major research institutions like the Development Center for Biotechnology,
Industrial Technology Research Institute, Institute for Information Industry and
National Applied Research Laboratories will also be seeking fresh talent.</P>
      <P>Since the program was launched in 2003 to encourage the return of highly skilled
nationals, thousands of overseas Taiwanese have returned home to work.</P>
      <P>In March 2007, a new feature was introduced to allow Taiwanese male students in
the U.S. who hold a master's degree from a university recognized by Taiwan's
Ministry of Education to apply for research and development positions at home as
an alternative to military service.</P>
      <P>Another facet of the government's s overseas recruitment drive is its Talent
Seeker Project that is aimed at attracting senior professionals in the hi-tech
industry by offering them incentives to return home.</P>
      <P>The delegation this year will meet potential job seekers from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m.
on Sept. 15 at Boston Sheraton Commander Hotel, which is located next to Harvard
University.</P>
      <P>Registrations  will  only  be  accepted  online  at  http:

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou defended Friday the government's cautious attitude toward
opening Taiwan to Chinese students.</P>
      <P>Ma, meeting with a delegation from the Association of Private Universities and
Colleges, said that although some people think the restrictions set for Chinese
students are unnecessary, he believes that caution is essential to sustain the
policy over the long term.</P>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan amended three laws last week to allow Chinese students to
study in Taiwan's universities and colleges, but three legal restrictions were
also imposed on the students -- restrictions that some lawmakers in Ma's own
party believed were unnecessary.</P>
      <P>These are refusing to recognize diplomas issued by Chinese medical schools,
forbidding Chinese students from enrolling in departments closely related to
Taiwan's national security, and banning those without Taiwanese citizenship
from taking state examinations to work as civil servants or professionals.</P>
      <P>Ma noted that Taiwan's declining birth rate is putting tremendous pressure on
enrollment at private universities and colleges, which might eventually force
some of them to close down.</P>
      <P>Under these circumstances, Ma suggested, the institutions should make good use
of their resources to recruit international students, especially those from
Southeast Asia.</P>
      <P>Methods that can be used to attract the students include providing all-English
courses and establishing a higher education accreditation system, he said.</P>
      <P>According to the president, the signing of the cross-Taiwan Strait economic
cooperation framework agreement in late June has provided greater incentive for
foreign students to study in Taiwan.</P>

      <P>The first Cross-Strait Cup Baseball Tournament is expected to take place next

      <P>Lin and CTABA board member George Chao, a former player on Taiwan's national
team, are currently in Beijing to see the Xinlongqi Cross-Strait Baseball
Invitational that opened in the Chinese capital Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Chao said although the skills of China's baseball players and the game's general
environment there lag far behind Taiwan's, Chinese baseball players occasionally
perform outstandingly in international competitions.</P>
      <P>"With Taiwan's competitiveness in baseball, both sides could cooperate to make
the baseball market in the greater China area a bigger pie," Chao envisioned.</P>
      <P>He suggested that the CTABA, its Chinese counterpart and Taiwan's Chinese
Professional Baseball League (CPBL) collaborate to sponsor baseball tournaments
in both Taiwan and China to help elevate the game's competitive level,
strengthen its structure and improve the caliber of the fans.</P>

      <P>An Academia Sinica research team has uncovered via a mouse model the secrets of
the formation of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) , a brain disorder
that causes dementia and for which there is currently no treatment, a researcher
said Friday.</P>
      <P>Tsai Kuen-jer, an assistant professor at National Cheng Kung University's
Graduate Institute of Clinical Medicine who took part in the research, touted
the finding as a major breakthrough in the study of the neurodegenerative
disease.</P>
      <P>Using the model will bring scientists closer to developing and creating
efficient drugs or therapies to treat FTLD patients, Tsai said.</P>
      <P>According to Academia Sinica, Taiwan's highest academic research institute, FTLD
is associated with atrophy in the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain that
can lead to memory loss, impairment of language ability and sometimes motor
neuron disease.</P>
      <P>It is one of the common causes of various kinds of dementia, including
Alzheimer's disease.</P>
      <P>The research team, led by Academician Che-Kun James Shen at the the Institute of
Molecular Biology, found an abnormal level of a type of cellular protein known
as TAR DNA binding protein 43 (TDP-43) in the brains of FTLD sufferers.</P>
      <P>The protein, which is capable of affecting neural cell activity, should exist in
the nucleus of a cell but is found at an increased levels in the cell plasma of
people with FTLD, Tsai said.</P>
      <P>In the study, the researchers genetically engineered mice with increased levels
of TDP-43 in the forebrain. They discovered that the mice exhibited symptoms
that mimic FTLD.</P>
      <P>"The finding that increased levels of TDP-43 protein in the forebrain  are
sufficient  to cause  FTLD and possibly  other neurodegenerative diseases yields
a new avenue for future studies of FTLD," said the institute in a statement.</P>
      <P>It pointed out that Shen's research team has already started to test a few drugs
with potential for treating FTLD and that a collaboration project with an
Australia-based laboratory has also been established to conduct drug screening.</P>
      <P>The results of the research paper, titled "Elevated Expression of TDP-43 in the
Forebrain of Mice is Sufficient to Cause Neurological and Pathological
Phenotypes Mimicking FTLD-U, " were published July 27 in the peer-reviewed
Journal of Experimental Medicine.</P>

      <P>Five Taiwanese aspirants have won the first IELTS (International English

Taipei announced Friday.</P>
      <P>"We are delighted to announce the five winners of our new British Council IELTS
scholarships for Taiwanese students planning to study at postgraduate levels at
overseas universities," said Alison Devine, the new director of the British
Council, the U.K.'s top international organization for cultural relations and
educational opportunities.</P>
      <P>Lin Nen-wei, Lee Yi-fang, Wu Pin-hsien, Li Yi-shan and Luh Tau-yu will each
receive a scholarship of NT$100,000, said Devine, who assumed her post in late
June. Except for Luh, who will be studying in the United States, the other
winners will be going to the U.K.</P>
      <P>Devine said the winners were among 15 individuals who were selected from a pool
of 153 applicants in the first phase of the process before emerging through the
second-phase interview process.</P>
      <P>Most of the winners are professionals with working experience. Li, who was
admitted to the University of Edinburgh, has taught at a junior high school in
the central city of Taichung for five years.</P>
      <P>Lee, who will attend University College London and major in preschool education,
has been an auditor at PricewaterhouseCoopers for four years.</P>
      <P>"Most Taiwanese students choose to study in the U.K. because it takes only a
year, rather than two years in the U.S., to receive a degree. It takes a lot of
financial pressure off students and their parents," Lee said.</P>
      <P>Annual tuition in the U.K. ranges between NT$400,000-500,000, Lee said, about
half what it costs in the U.S.</P>
      <P>The winners also praised IELTS, an exam testing the ability to listen, speak,
write and read in English, and compared it favorably to the Test of English as a
Foreign Language (TOEFL) , a U.S. Internet-based test, for its face-to-face
interaction.</P>
      <P>Prudence Chou, the British Council's Exam Service Manager, said the average
score of Taiwanese students taking the test increased from 5.59 (out of nine
points) in 2007 to 5.72 in 2009, but indicated that there was still room for
improvement relative to the average scores of other Asian countries.</P>
      <P>According to the British Council, female test takers outnumbered male test
takers by a 7: 3 ratio, which one of the winners attributed to Taiwan's social
traditions.</P>
      <P>"I discussed the fact with my friends and most of them thought that it would be
much harder for Taiwanese men to suspend their jobs without pay for a year like
me. Men tend to shoulder more 'social pressure' to be financially stable in
Taiwan's society, " said Li, who plans to resume her job as a teacher in late
2011.</P>
      <P>The British Council Taipei said it will offer scholarships again in 2011 to help
more Taiwanese students.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Kaohsiung should shelve political concerns  when doing business with China in
the post-Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement (ECFA) era and treat China
like any other business client, Japanese business strategist Kenichi Ohmae said
Friday during a speech in southern Taiwan's Kaohsiung City.</P>
      <P>Ohmae, a renowned forecaster of economic trends, said the risk of an economic
bubble in China and the signing of the ECFA will boost Chinese investment in
Taiwan in the near future.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung must grab this opportunity and prioritize economic development over
political ideology,  said Ohmae. Kaohsiung is considered  to be a stronghold  of
the opposition  Democratic Progressive Party, which opposes closer ties with
China out of fear that Taiwan might become over-reliant on its giant neighbor.</P>
      <P>He suggested  that  the Kaohsiung  city government  should demonstrate an
entrepreneurial spirit and view China as an important business client.</P>
      <P>He noted that Japan was initially intimidated by the idea of opening up to
tourists from China, only to learn afterwards that the trepidation was
unnecessary.</P>
      <P>In fact, Japan's opening policy improved its stagnant economy, with an estimated
2 million Chinese tourists expected to have visited by the end of this year, a
1.2 million increase compared to last year, added Ohmae.</P>
      <P>He said Kaohsiung Harbor has a great advantage with its potential for becoming
an Asia-Pacific hub, provided it stops relying on exports, starts learning from
the success of other transit harbors such as Hong Kong, Singapore and Dubai, and
forms relations with ports along the coast of China and Japan.</P>
      <P>He said the city government should also have sufficient business knowledge  and
should offer foreign investors business-oriented services such as like "one
window" services and a safe investment environment.</P>
      <P>The ruling Kuomintang's Kaohsiung mayoral candidate Huang Chao- shun attended
the speech and said that if she wins the municipality election there in
November, she will invite Ohmae to serve as an economic consultant for the city
government in a bid to generate more jobs in the area.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's economy heated up in July as the job market gained some momentum, but
leading indicators for the month dipped slightly, the Council for Economic
Planning and Development (CEPD) said Friday.</P>
      <P>The monitoring indicator for the overall economy gained one point in July to
rise to 38 points and flashed a red light, which signifies the economy is
booming, the CEPD said.</P>
      <P>"In general, the local economy still maintained steady growth, " the CEPD said
in a press release.</P>
      <P>Non-agricultural employment went from yellow-red to red in July as the job
market improved, which helped tip the monitoring index's scale to red after
being yellow-red the previous two months.</P>
      <P>The planning agency uses a five-color system to gauge the country's economic
performance for any given month.</P>
      <P>Blue implies a sluggish economy,  yellow-blue represents a slowdown, green
indicates a stable economy, yellow-red means the economy is mildly overheated,
and red signifies overheating.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's economy flashed a red light in the first four months of this year, and
showed a yellow-red light in May and June.</P>
      <P>The index of coincident indicators, which reflect economic activity in the
period measured, rose 1.0 percent to 124.0 in July, but the index of leading
indicators, which gauge economic performance in three to six months, fell 0.2
percent from June to 117.6.</P>
      <P>Despite the small drop, the CEPD said it remained cautiously optimistic about
the economy's prospects because strong growth in emerging economies will help
maintain export momentum and government investment promotion drives are expected
to spur private investment.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's economy grew 13.7 percent year-on-year in the first quarter and 12.5
percent in the second quarter, the Department of Budget, Accounting and
Statistics reported on Aug. 19. It revised its forecast for full-year growth
upwards to 8.24 percent.</P>
      <P>The country's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate fell for the the 11th
consecutive month to 5.17 percent in July, and the government has vowed to pull
it below 5 percent by the end of the year.</P>

      <P>Following their recent signing of agreements on economic cooperation, Taiwan and
China are facing a more important task of launching "in-depth talks" in 2011 on
cultural exchanges, Taiwan's top negotiator with China said Friday.</P>
      <P>Chairman of Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation Chiang Pin-kung said he hopes
the two sides will come up with relevant framework agreements next year through
negotiations by the SEF and its China counterpart the Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS).</P>
      <P>The SEF and ARATS are intermediary bodies assigned by their respective
governments to handle cross-strait exchanges in the absence of formal ties.</P>
      <P>The cultural links between the two sides are from the same root and are more
important than economic and trade ties, Chiang said in Taipei City at the launch
of a series of cultural performances and exhibitions by a group of visiting
artists from China.</P>
      <P>Increased cultural interaction will serve to promote harmonious development of
cross-strait relations because culture can help to narrow the knowledge gap
between the people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait, he said.</P>
      <P>Next year, "the focus will be on the cultural field," he said.</P>
      <P>The Chinese delegation, led by a Hebei provincial official Nie Chenxi, arrived
in Taiwan Thursday on a one-week performance tour of Taiwan's major cities.</P>
      <P>The tour will include performances by the 40-member Peking Opera troupe and its
leader Pei Yanling as well as a display of various traditional folks arts from
Hebei Province, including music, wood paintings and handcraft.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and China are looking at other areas of cooperation in the wake of a
recent economic cooperation framework agreement under which the tariffs on
hundreds of products from both sides will be removed or lowered.</P>
      <P>In a meeting that will be held before the end of the year, Chiang and ARATS
President Chen Yunlin are expected to work toward signing cross-strait
agreements on cooperation in the medical and health care field.</P>

      <P>Maggie Tsai doesn't credit her success in improving Taipei's cultural landscape
to being married to Fubon Financial Vice Chairman Richard Tsai. She credits it
to a decade of hard work.</P>
      <P>Ms. Tsai, CEO of the Fubon Art Foundation, held Taipei's first Very Fun Park
event in 2001. She aimed to bring art into everyday city life by placing
contemporary artwork at various shops and buildings in the capital.</P>
      <P>With a limited budget and a staff of eight people, she and foundation Director
Vivian Hsiung decided to focus the project around Taipei's affluent eastern
district, hoping that businesses in the area would be more willing to cooperate
in cultural activities.</P>
      <P>"We were totally wrong! Shop space is precious because of the high rent in the
area, " Tsai said. "Not many owners were interested in displaying artwork in
their shops."</P>
      <P>But Hsiung combed through alleys and talked with shop owners, struggling to
convince them to participate. Meanwhile, Tsai backed Hsiung up by organizing
events and selecting art.</P>
      <P>In the end, dozens of artists' works including paintings, sculptures and
installations were displayed in the area for a month in August and September
that year. After a six-year break, the event returned in 2007 and has been an
annual part of the city's art calendar since then, drawing more and more support
each year.</P>
      <P>Very Fun Park 2010 opened on July 16 and runs through Sept. 5. The event
includes artwork at 36 locations throughout Taipei's eastern district -- and
this time Hsiung didn't have to beg.</P>
      <P>"Many businesses came to us and asked if they could take part, " she said. "Some
of them even closed their shops for hours just to allow for the arrival and
installation of the works."</P>
      <P>The enthusiasm of shop owners shows that Tsai's efforts at planting cultural
seeds are paying off.</P>
      <P>"Friends have said I'm a fool attempting the impossible, " she said. "My answer
is, 'Not at all. We're not fools. Can't you see what we're achieving bit by

    <TEXT>
      <P>First lady Chow Mei-ching is scheduled to make her first humanitarian trip to
Haiti on Sunday after the Caribbean country was devastated by a major earthquake
in January this year, World Vision Taiwan said Friday.</P>
      <P>She will make the trip as honorary president of the Red Cross Society of the
Republic of China and "Love Ambassador" for World Vision.</P>
      <P>Known for her advocacy for child welfare, the first lady will meet  earthquake
survivors  and  orphans  in Petionville  and Port-au-Prince. Chow also plans to
visit a make-shift tent camp in Delmas.</P>
      <P>She will also be visiting a Food For the Poor center to witness first-hand the
distribution of rice donations from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to World Vision, Chow will give away solar-powered light fixtures as
part of Taiwan's continuing effort to help Haiti get back on its feet.</P>
      <P>As Haiti's ally since the former French colony became an independent country in
1956, Taiwan was one of the first countries to offer humanitarian support during
the initial aftermath of the earthquake. A 23-person search and rescue team from
Taiwan's National Fire Agency was among the first foreign help to arrive in
Haiti.</P>
      <P>To date, Taiwan has donated more than 400 metric tons of rice to Haiti since the
deadly 7.3 magnitude temblor on Jan. 12 that claimed more than 300,000 lives and
displaced at least 1.5 million people.</P>
      <P>Through the International Cooperation and Development Fund, the government  of
Taiwan has also pledged to outfit schools and orphanages in Haiti with 1,020
computer work stations, according to Food for the Poor, one of the biggest
international relief agencies in the U.S.</P>
      <P>In a meeting with Haitian Prime Minister Jean-Max Bellerive and Dominican
Republic President Leonard Fernandez in Santo Domingo two weeks after the
earthquake, President Ma Ying-jeou promised cash aid of US$10 million and said
Taiwan would participate in the rebuilding effort by offering aid in public
health care, resettlement of survivors and agricultural support.</P>
      <P>After Haiti, Chow will also make a brief two-day stopover in the Dominican
Republic, where she will visit a job training center, two primary schools, and a
health center.</P>
      <P>During the trip, Chow will meet six children whom she and the president are
sponsoring in both countries, World Vision Taiwan said. She will bring gifts
including story books, coloring books and ceramic flutes.</P>
      <P>The first lady is scheduled to return to Taiwan on Sept. 5.</P>
      <P>Chow visited the United States, Canada and Russia in January and February as
honorary director of Taiwan's renowned Cloud Gate Dance Theatre. She made a
similar trip to Italy and Spain in June and July.</P>

      <P>Taiwan should prioritize several industries in follow-up talks with China under
the framework trade pact the two signed in late June to counter a possible East
Asian free trade zone, the Bureau of Foreign Trade (BOFT) said Friday.</P>
      <P>The BOFT said the service, petrochemical, steel, machinery, electronics and
automobile industries should top the agenda in future negotiations under the
economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) so that they would remain
competitive in China's market even if China, Japan and South Korea form a free
trade union.</P>
      <P>The bureau made the suggestion in a report on the progress of a free trade
agreement among the three nations and its impact on Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The report noted that a private study conducted jointly by China, Japan  and
South Korea in December  2008 concluded  that the establishment of a free trade
zone of the three countries could optimize their interests.</P>
      <P>It could boost Japan's GDP by 0.3 percent, China's GDP by 0.4 percent, and South
Korea's GDP by 2.8 percent, the study said.</P>
      <P>The bureau's report said the three countries have signed FTAs with other
countries or regions in recent years that have adversely impacted Taiwan's
exports, and if the three were to sign an FTA, then its threat to Taiwan could
be even greater.</P>
      <P>The BOFT also said that the threat of ASEAN plus three (China, Japan, South
Korea), which is still being negotiated, was bigger than the existing ASEAN plus
one (China), as all of Taiwan's major trading rivals would be economically
integrated.</P>

      <P>The National Health Research Institutes (NHRI) said Friday it was seeking
pharmaceutical manufacturers to produce a vaccine targeting enterovirus 71
(EV71) , a deadly virus that killed 78 children during a 1998 outbreak in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>A public screening of companies has been launched and will continue until Sept.
8, the NHRI said, adding that human testing could begin as early as September.</P>
      <P>Although research into making the vaccine has been conducted since 1998, the
NHRI wasn't able to establish a reliable technique until March this year.</P>
      <P>The technique involves the use of a Vero cell culture, part of a cell line
originally isolated from an African green monkey's kidney.</P>
      <P>The manufacturer will be required to produce the vaccine in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Enteroviruses are a large family of viruses responsible for many infections in
children. EV71 is one of the major causes of hand, foot and mouth disease, and
is sometimes associated with central nervous system diseases such as meningitis
and encephalitis. Newborns and toddlers are most vulnerable to EV71.</P>

      <P>An amendment that stipulates legislative constituencies remain unchanged for 10
years could be unconstitutional, the nation's top election official said Friday.</P>
      <P>Central Election Commission (CEC) Chairman Rai Hau-min was referring to an
amendment to the Public Officials Election and Recall Act that cleared the
legislature during its extra session last week.</P>
      <P>Rai said that the CEC "stands by its view that the amendment could be
unconstitutional, " adding that he had previously expressed such a view during a
legislative committee.</P>
      <P>Rai made the remarks after meeting  opposition  Democratic Progressive Party
Legislator William Lai, who is running in the year-end Tainan municipality
election.</P>
      <P>"I've come to visit Rai because the amendment violates the Constitution," Lai
said.</P>
      <P>Lai said that after the merger of Tainan City and Tainan County, the new
municipality will see its legislative seats increase to six from the present
five because the Constitution stipulates that one legislator be elected for
every 300,000 people.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung municipality, on the other hand, could see one seat taken away.</P>
      <P>Lai accused the ruling Kuomintang of using its overwhelming majority in the

      <P>Taiwan officially became a full member of the Inter-American Tropical Tuna
Commission (IATTC) Friday, which entitles it to vote in the commission's policy-
making process and gives a boost to the rights of Taiwanese fishermen, the
Council of Agricultural Affairs (COA) announced Friday.</P>
      <P>At a time when international management of tuna stocks has become increasingly

      <P>The IATTC is in charge of the management and conservation of tuna in the East
Pacific, an important fishing ground for high-value species such as bigeye and
yellowfin tuna for Taiwanese fishing vessels.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has been an IATTC observer since 1973, but this status did not confer
voting rights.</P>
      <P>In the peak tuna years, more than 90 Taiwanese fishing ships operated in the

      <P>A Taiwanese-American couple have recently returned from a daring 82-day,
41,843-km round-the-globe flight, becoming the first people of Chinese descent
in history to successfully fly a single-engine aircraft around the world.</P>
      <P>Jeffrey Ying and his wife Renee Chen departed Los Angeles May 4 aboard their
single-engine Piper PA 46, heading north to Canada where they embarked on their
epic global flight, returning to Los Angeles July 20 safe and sound.</P>
      <P>Ying, who participated in the design and building of Taiwan's first self-made
aircraft in the 1980s, told CNA that flying around the world had always been his
dream, but it was only some 10 years ago that he began to work toward realizing
that goal.</P>
      <P>He said it was not until he actually started making the preparations for the
trip that he realized how hard it is to fly around the world.</P>
      <P>"I had a bumpy start with my first two aircraft, but managed to lead the
endeavor back onto the right track after I obtained a third plane two years
ago," he said.</P>
      <P>By the time he and his wife were ready to kick off the flight, however, he
realized that buying the aircraft was the easiest part of the round-the-globe
project.</P>
      <P>Charting flight plans, obtaining landing permits from the many airports they
would need to use,  and fly-over  permits from governments in advance, as well
as refueling, were the major issues that had to be surmounted, he added.</P>
      <P>Those "human" matters, however, were nothing compared to what happens in the
sky, he said.</P>
      <P>"The weather issue was the biggest enemy for us," he went on.</P>
      <P>Soon after they reached Iceland, they were stuck there by a massive ash cloud
from a volcanic eruption in that tiny country, which caused chaos across Europe
after all flights over the United Kingdom were canceled.</P>
      <P>"Believing that getting stuck at London's Heathrow Airport was definitely not an
option, we wandered from one small airport to another around Scandinavia, trying
to inch our way south toward Africa, " Ying recalled.</P>
      <P>They experienced another life-or-death challenge one day while flying from
Brunei to Cambodia. Caught in a tremendous thunderstorm, all three radar and
navigation systems on the aircraft became inoperable and it was only Ying's
instinct and experience that got them down safely.</P>
      <P>"We basically collapsed into our seats once we landed in Cambodia," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Ying said that despite their adversities, they were helped along the way by many
kind-hearted people.</P>
      <P>On the day they arrived at the Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport at midnight
running on fumes, for example, they found to their horror that they did not have
enough Taiwanese currency to pay for their fuel.</P>
      <P>To their eternal gratitude, China Airlines ground staff had a whip-round and
raised the money to pay for their gas.</P>
      <P>Ying became the 166th pilot in the world to fly a single-engine plane around the
world. He and his wife recorded their journey with more than 3,000 photographs
taken in the 26 countries they visited.</P>

      <P>Boosted by strong buying in construction shares, Taiwan share prices closed up
0.43 percent Friday, recovering slightly from losses in the previous two days,
dealers said.</P>
      <P>The weighted index rose 33.17 points to 7,722.91, after moving between 7,702.59
and 7,722.91, on turnover of NT$92.1 billion (US$2.88 billion).</P>
      <P>The market opened up 12.85 points, with investors more reluctant to continue to
dump shares as the market found technical support after two days of correction,
dealers said.</P>
      <P>The construction sector, which gained the most at 2.7 percent, was boosted by a
forecast by Credit Suisse research analyst Tao Dong that Taipei's real estate
market will certainly go up.</P>
      <P>Textile stocks rose 1.4 percent, and the foodstuff sector added 1.3 percent
after suffering a 2.4 percent decline on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Financial shares were up 0.9 percent, plastics and chemical issues advanced 0.7
percent, and paper and pulp shares rose 0.6 percent.</P>
      <P>The machinery and electronics sector edged up 0.1 percent, while cement stocks
remained unchanged.</P>
      <P>A total of 1,780 stocks closed down and 1,683 finished higher, while 333
remained unchanged.</P>
      <P>Allan Lin, assistant vice president of the research department at Concord
Securities, said that the local shares market, after falling in the past two
days, was shored up by bargain hunting buying, but it also encountered
resistance as it rose.</P>
      <P>Lin said he expects the market to enter a narrow consolidation phase, with the
index hovering between 7,650 and 7,850 next week.</P>
      <P>Taiwan International Securities analyst Benson Huang said that the market was
still a bit bearish as foreign investors have turned to the sell side in the
stock futures market.</P>
      <P>He also said that the market mood was cautious ahead of the latest GDP figures
from the U.S. and a speech by Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke later Friday
on the U.S. economic outlook.</P>
      <P>"The index would need to stand firm above the 90-day-average of 7,655 next week
if it is to move upward," Huang said.</P>
      <P>Kevin Lin, senior vice president of Fuh Hong Financial Planning Co., predicted
that market investors will grow more cautious with the approach of November 27
municipal  mayoral elections  and the uncertainties over the U.S. and European
economies.</P>
      <P>"Local investors usually begin to turn cautious three months before an
election," Lin said.</P>
      <P>Foreign investors, including mainland Chinese investors, were net sellers of
NT$5.93 billion-worth of shares.</P>

      <P>Representatives of Taiwan electronics companies and government agencies will
launch a recruitment drive in Boston, Massachusetts next month to hire overseas
Taiwanese for jobs in the fields of business, education and research.</P>
      <P>The delegation, led by Minister without Portfolio Chang Jin-fu and Chairwoman
Christina Liu from the Council for Economic Planning and Development, will
conduct one-on-one interviews with eligible people on Sept. 15.</P>
      <P>The  participating  companies  and  academic  and  research institutions are
expected to offer a total of 1,000 positions in Taiwan, China and the U.S. under
the Taiwan government's Overseas Science and Technology Personnel Recruitment
Program.</P>
      <P>The delegation  consists of major Taiwan-based  electronics companies such as
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) , Foxconn Technology Group,
Mediateck, Delta Electronics and Chimei Innolux Corporation as well as
U.S.-based Taiwanese companies like AcBel Polytech and the Aurora Group.</P>
      <P>Because of expansion, Taiwan electronic companies have been experiencing a
shortage of skilled technicians in LED and solar- production industry. They will
be looking to fill the shortfall at the job fair.</P>
      <P>In the field of education, National Cheng Kung University, National Chiao Tung
University, National Yang Ming University, and China Medical University will be
aiming to recruit teaching staff.</P>
      <P>Major research institutions like the Development Center for Biotechnology,
Industrial Technology Research Institute, Institute for Information Industry and
National Applied Research Laboratories will also be seeking fresh talent.</P>
      <P>Since the program was launched in 2003 to encourage the return of highly skilled
nationals, thousands of overseas Taiwanese have returned home to work.</P>
      <P>In March 2007, a new feature was introduced to allow Taiwanese male students in
the U.S. who hold a master's degree from a university recognized by Taiwan's
Ministry of Education to apply for research and development positions at home as
an alternative to military service.</P>
      <P>Another facet of the government's s overseas recruitment drive is its Talent
Seeker Project that is aimed at attracting senior professionals in the hi-tech
industry by offering them incentives to return home.</P>
      <P>The delegation this year will meet potential job seekers from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m.
on Sept. 15 at Boston Sheraton Commander Hotel, which is located next to Harvard
University.</P>
      <P>Registrations  will  only  be  accepted  online  at  http:

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou defended Friday the government's cautious attitude toward
opening Taiwan to Chinese students.</P>
      <P>Ma, meeting with a delegation from the Association of Private Universities and
Colleges, said that although some people think the restrictions set for Chinese
students are unnecessary, he believes that caution is essential to sustain the
policy over the long term.</P>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan amended three laws last week to allow Chinese students to
study in Taiwan's universities and colleges, but three legal restrictions were
also imposed on the students -- restrictions that some lawmakers in Ma's own
party believed were unnecessary.</P>
      <P>These are refusing to recognize diplomas issued by Chinese medical schools,
forbidding Chinese students from enrolling in departments closely related to
Taiwan's national security, and banning those without Taiwanese citizenship
from taking state examinations to work as civil servants or professionals.</P>
      <P>Ma noted that Taiwan's declining birth rate is putting tremendous pressure on
enrollment at private universities and colleges, which might eventually force
some of them to close down.</P>
      <P>Under these circumstances, Ma suggested, the institutions should make good use
of their resources to recruit international students, especially those from
Southeast Asia.</P>
      <P>Methods that can be used to attract the students include providing all-English
courses and establishing a higher education accreditation system, he said.</P>
      <P>According to the president, the signing of the cross-Taiwan Strait economic
cooperation framework agreement in late June has provided greater incentive for
foreign students to study in Taiwan.</P>

      <P>The first Cross-Strait Cup Baseball Tournament is expected to take place next
year in China and the second will be held in Taiwan, an official of the Chinese
Taipei Amateur Baseball Association (CTABA) said in Beijing Friday.</P>
      <P>"National baseball associations from the two sides have been discussing the
tournament and decisions on details are expected to be finalized by the end of
this year, " said CTABA Secretary-General Richard Lin.</P>
      <P>Lin and CTABA board member George Chao, a former player on Taiwan's national
team, are currently in Beijing to see the Xinlongqi Cross-Strait Baseball
Invitational that opened in the Chinese capital Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Chao said although the skills of China's baseball players and the game's general
environment there lag far behind Taiwan's, Chinese baseball players occasionally
perform outstandingly in international competitions.</P>
      <P>"With Taiwan's competitiveness in baseball, both sides could cooperate to make
the baseball market in the greater China area a bigger pie," Chao envisioned.</P>
      <P>He suggested that the CTABA, its Chinese counterpart and Taiwan's Chinese
Professional Baseball League (CPBL) collaborate to sponsor baseball tournaments
in both Taiwan and China to help elevate the game's competitive level,
strengthen its structure and improve the caliber of the fans.</P>
      <P>He called for Taiwanese businessmen operating in China to pitch in to "create
the big pie" together.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Liang Kung-ping, a Taiwanese businessman who founded Scoresports Co.
in Beijing in 2008, said he has found that baseball has tremendous potential in
many areas around China, particularly in remote provinces, where talented boys
are willing to devote their time to working on their baseball skills.</P>
      <P>Scoresports is the major sponsor of the Xinlongqi competition.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Academia Sinica makes breakthrough in brain degeneration studies</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>An Academia Sinica research team has uncovered via a mouse model the secrets of
the formation of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) , a brain disorder
that causes dementia and for which there is currently no treatment, a researcher
said Friday.</P>
      <P>Tsai Kuen-jer, an assistant professor at National Cheng Kung University's
Graduate Institute of Clinical Medicine who took part in the research, touted
the finding as a major breakthrough in the study of the neurodegenerative
disease.</P>
      <P>Using the model will bring scientists closer to developing and creating
efficient drugs or therapies to treat FTLD patients, Tsai said.</P>
      <P>According to Academia Sinica, Taiwan's highest academic research institute, FTLD
is associated with atrophy in the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain that
can lead to memory loss, impairment of language ability and sometimes motor
neuron disease.</P>
      <P>It is one of the common causes of various kinds of dementia, including
Alzheimer's disease.</P>
      <P>The research team, led by Academician Che-Kun James Shen at the the Institute of
Molecular Biology, found an abnormal level of a type of cellular protein known
as TAR DNA binding protein 43 (TDP-43) in the brains of FTLD sufferers.</P>
      <P>The protein, which is capable of affecting neural cell activity, should exist in
the nucleus of a cell but is found at an increased levels in the cell plasma of
people with FTLD, Tsai said.</P>
      <P>In the study, the researchers genetically engineered mice with increased levels
of TDP-43 in the forebrain. They discovered that the mice exhibited symptoms
that mimic FTLD.</P>
      <P>"The finding that increased levels of TDP-43 protein in the forebrain  are
sufficient  to cause  FTLD and possibly  other neurodegenerative diseases yields
a new avenue for future studies of FTLD," said the institute in a statement.</P>
      <P>It pointed out that Shen's research team has already started to test a few drugs
with potential for treating FTLD and that a collaboration project with an
Australia-based laboratory has also been established to conduct drug screening.</P>
      <P>The results of the research paper, titled "Elevated Expression of TDP-43 in the
Forebrain of Mice is Sufficient to Cause Neurological and Pathological
Phenotypes Mimicking FTLD-U, " were published July 27 in the peer-reviewed
Journal of Experimental Medicine.</P>

      <P>Five Taiwanese aspirants have won the first IELTS (International English
Language Testing System) Scholarships contested in Taiwan and will soon head
overseas to start the fall semester in selected schools, the British Council
Taipei announced Friday.</P>
      <P>"We are delighted to announce the five winners of our new British Council IELTS
scholarships for Taiwanese students planning to study at postgraduate levels at
overseas universities," said Alison Devine, the new director of the British
Council, the U.K.'s top international organization for cultural relations and
educational opportunities.</P>
      <P>Lin Nen-wei, Lee Yi-fang, Wu Pin-hsien, Li Yi-shan and Luh Tau-yu will each
receive a scholarship of NT$100,000, said Devine, who assumed her post in late
June. Except for Luh, who will be studying in the United States, the other
winners will be going to the U.K.</P>
      <P>Devine said the winners were among 15 individuals who were selected from a pool
of 153 applicants in the first phase of the process before emerging through the
second-phase interview process.</P>
      <P>Most of the winners are professionals with working experience. Li, who was
admitted to the University of Edinburgh, has taught at a junior high school in
the central city of Taichung for five years.</P>
      <P>Lee, who will attend University College London and major in preschool education,
has been an auditor at PricewaterhouseCoopers for four years.</P>
      <P>"Most Taiwanese students choose to study in the U.K. because it takes only a
year, rather than two years in the U.S., to receive a degree. It takes a lot of
financial pressure off students and their parents," Lee said.</P>
      <P>Annual tuition in the U.K. ranges between NT$400,000-500,000, Lee said, about
half what it costs in the U.S.</P>
      <P>The winners also praised IELTS, an exam testing the ability to listen, speak,
write and read in English, and compared it favorably to the Test of English as a
Foreign Language (TOEFL) , a U.S. Internet-based test, for its face-to-face
interaction.</P>
      <P>Prudence Chou, the British Council's Exam Service Manager, said the average
score of Taiwanese students taking the test increased from 5.59 (out of nine
points) in 2007 to 5.72 in 2009, but indicated that there was still room for
improvement relative to the average scores of other Asian countries.</P>
      <P>According to the British Council, female test takers outnumbered male test
takers by a 7: 3 ratio, which one of the winners attributed to Taiwan's social
traditions.</P>
      <P>"I discussed the fact with my friends and most of them thought that it would be
much harder for Taiwanese men to suspend their jobs without pay for a year like
me. Men tend to shoulder more 'social pressure' to be financially stable in
Taiwan's society, " said Li, who plans to resume her job as a teacher in late
2011.</P>
      <P>The British Council Taipei said it will offer scholarships again in 2011 to help
more Taiwanese students.</P>

      <P>Kaohsiung should shelve political concerns  when doing business with China in
the post-Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement (ECFA) era and treat China
like any other business client, Japanese business strategist Kenichi Ohmae said
Friday during a speech in southern Taiwan's Kaohsiung City.</P>
      <P>Ohmae, a renowned forecaster of economic trends, said the risk of an economic
bubble in China and the signing of the ECFA will boost Chinese investment in
Taiwan in the near future.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung must grab this opportunity and prioritize economic development over
political ideology,  said Ohmae. Kaohsiung is considered  to be a stronghold  of
the opposition  Democratic Progressive Party, which opposes closer ties with
China out of fear that Taiwan might become over-reliant on its giant neighbor.</P>
      <P>He suggested  that  the Kaohsiung  city government  should demonstrate an
entrepreneurial spirit and view China as an important business client.</P>
      <P>He noted that Japan was initially intimidated by the idea of opening up to
tourists from China, only to learn afterwards that the trepidation was
unnecessary.</P>
      <P>In fact, Japan's opening policy improved its stagnant economy, with an estimated
2 million Chinese tourists expected to have visited by the end of this year, a
1.2 million increase compared to last year, added Ohmae.</P>
      <P>He said Kaohsiung Harbor has a great advantage with its potential for becoming
an Asia-Pacific hub, provided it stops relying on exports, starts learning from
the success of other transit harbors such as Hong Kong, Singapore and Dubai, and
forms relations with ports along the coast of China and Japan.</P>
      <P>He said the city government should also have sufficient business knowledge  and
should offer foreign investors business-oriented services such as like "one
window" services and a safe investment environment.</P>
      <P>The ruling Kuomintang's Kaohsiung mayoral candidate Huang Chao- shun attended
the speech and said that if she wins the municipality election there in
November, she will invite Ohmae to serve as an economic consultant for the city
government in a bid to generate more jobs in the area.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's economy heated up in July as the job market gained some momentum, but
leading indicators for the month dipped slightly, the Council for Economic
Planning and Development (CEPD) said Friday.</P>
      <P>The monitoring indicator for the overall economy gained one point in July to
rise to 38 points and flashed a red light, which signifies the economy is
booming, the CEPD said.</P>
      <P>"In general, the local economy still maintained steady growth, " the CEPD said
in a press release.</P>
      <P>Non-agricultural employment went from yellow-red to red in July as the job
market improved, which helped tip the monitoring index's scale to red after
being yellow-red the previous two months.</P>
      <P>The planning agency uses a five-color system to gauge the country's economic
performance for any given month.</P>
      <P>Blue implies a sluggish economy,  yellow-blue represents a slowdown, green
indicates a stable economy, yellow-red means the economy is mildly overheated,
and red signifies overheating.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's economy flashed a red light in the first four months of this year, and
showed a yellow-red light in May and June.</P>
      <P>The index of coincident indicators, which reflect economic activity in the
period measured, rose 1.0 percent to 124.0 in July, but the index of leading
indicators, which gauge economic performance in three to six months, fell 0.2
percent from June to 117.6.</P>
      <P>Despite the small drop, the CEPD said it remained cautiously optimistic about
the economy's prospects because strong growth in emerging economies will help
maintain export momentum and government investment promotion drives are expected
to spur private investment.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's economy grew 13.7 percent year-on-year in the first quarter and 12.5
percent in the second quarter, the Department of Budget, Accounting and
Statistics reported on Aug. 19. It revised its forecast for full-year growth
upwards to 8.24 percent.</P>
      <P>The country's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate fell for the the 11th
consecutive month to 5.17 percent in July, and the government has vowed to pull
it below 5 percent by the end of the year.</P>

      <P>Following their recent signing of agreements on economic cooperation, Taiwan and
China are facing a more important task of launching "in-depth talks" in 2011 on
cultural exchanges, Taiwan's top negotiator with China said Friday.</P>
      <P>Chairman of Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation Chiang Pin-kung said he hopes
the two sides will come up with relevant framework agreements next year through
negotiations by the SEF and its China counterpart the Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS).</P>
      <P>The SEF and ARATS are intermediary bodies assigned by their respective
governments to handle cross-strait exchanges in the absence of formal ties.</P>
      <P>The cultural links between the two sides are from the same root and are more
important than economic and trade ties, Chiang said in Taipei City at the launch
of a series of cultural performances and exhibitions by a group of visiting
artists from China.</P>
      <P>Increased cultural interaction will serve to promote harmonious development of
cross-strait relations because culture can help to narrow the knowledge gap
between the people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait, he said.</P>
      <P>Next year, "the focus will be on the cultural field," he said.</P>
      <P>The Chinese delegation, led by a Hebei provincial official Nie Chenxi, arrived
in Taiwan Thursday on a one-week performance tour of Taiwan's major cities.</P>
      <P>The tour will include performances by the 40-member Peking Opera troupe and its
leader Pei Yanling as well as a display of various traditional folks arts from
Hebei Province, including music, wood paintings and handcraft.</P>

      <P>Maggie Tsai doesn't credit her success in improving Taipei's cultural landscape
to being married to Fubon Financial Vice Chairman Richard Tsai. She credits it
to a decade of hard work.</P>
      <P>Ms. Tsai, CEO of the Fubon Art Foundation, held Taipei's first Very Fun Park
event in 2001. She aimed to bring art into everyday city life by placing
contemporary artwork at various shops and buildings in the capital.</P>
      <P>With a limited budget and a staff of eight people, she and foundation Director
Vivian Hsiung decided to focus the project around Taipei's affluent eastern
district, hoping that businesses in the area would be more willing to cooperate
in cultural activities.</P>
      <P>"We were totally wrong! Shop space is precious because of the high rent in the
area, " Tsai said. "Not many owners were interested in displaying artwork in
their shops."</P>
      <P>But Hsiung combed through alleys and talked with shop owners, struggling to
convince them to participate. Meanwhile, Tsai backed Hsiung up by organizing
events and selecting art.</P>
      <P>In the end, dozens of artists' works including paintings, sculptures and
installations were displayed in the area for a month in August and September
that year. After a six-year break, the event returned in 2007 and has been an
annual part of the city's art calendar since then, drawing more and more support
each year.</P>
      <P>Very Fun Park 2010 opened on July 16 and runs through Sept. 5. The event
includes artwork at 36 locations throughout Taipei's eastern district -- and
this time Hsiung didn't have to beg.</P>
      <P>"Many businesses came to us and asked if they could take part, " she said. "Some
of them even closed their shops for hours just to allow for the arrival and
installation of the works."</P>
      <P>The enthusiasm of shop owners shows that Tsai's efforts at planting cultural
seeds are paying off.</P>
      <P>"Friends have said I'm a fool attempting the impossible, " she said. "My answer
is, 'Not at all. We're not fools. Can't you see what we're achieving bit by
bit?'"</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>First lady Chow Mei-ching is scheduled to make her first humanitarian trip to
Haiti on Sunday after the Caribbean country was devastated by a major earthquake
in January this year, World Vision Taiwan said Friday.</P>
      <P>She will make the trip as honorary president of the Red Cross Society of the
Republic of China and "Love Ambassador" for World Vision.</P>
      <P>Known for her advocacy for child welfare, the first lady will meet  earthquake
survivors  and  orphans  in Petionville  and Port-au-Prince. Chow also plans to
visit a make-shift tent camp in Delmas.</P>
      <P>She will also be visiting a Food For the Poor center to witness first-hand the
distribution of rice donations from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to World Vision, Chow will give away solar-powered light fixtures as
part of Taiwan's continuing effort to help Haiti get back on its feet.</P>
      <P>As Haiti's ally since the former French colony became an independent country in
1956, Taiwan was one of the first countries to offer humanitarian support during
the initial aftermath of the earthquake. A 23-person search and rescue team from
Taiwan's National Fire Agency was among the first foreign help to arrive in
Haiti.</P>
      <P>To date, Taiwan has donated more than 400 metric tons of rice to Haiti since the
deadly 7.3 magnitude temblor on Jan. 12 that claimed more than 300,000 lives and
displaced at least 1.5 million people.</P>
      <P>Through the International Cooperation and Development Fund, the government  of
Taiwan has also pledged to outfit schools and orphanages in Haiti with 1,020
computer work stations, according to Food for the Poor, one of the biggest
international relief agencies in the U.S.</P>
      <P>In a meeting with Haitian Prime Minister Jean-Max Bellerive and Dominican
Republic President Leonard Fernandez in Santo Domingo two weeks after the
earthquake, President Ma Ying-jeou promised cash aid of US$10 million and said
Taiwan would participate in the rebuilding effort by offering aid in public
health care, resettlement of survivors and agricultural support.</P>
      <P>After Haiti, Chow will also make a brief two-day stopover in the Dominican
Republic, where she will visit a job training center, two primary schools, and a
health center.</P>
      <P>During the trip, Chow will meet six children whom she and the president are
sponsoring in both countries, World Vision Taiwan said. She will bring gifts
including story books, coloring books and ceramic flutes.</P>
      <P>The first lady is scheduled to return to Taiwan on Sept. 5.</P>
      <P>Chow visited the United States, Canada and Russia in January and February as
honorary director of Taiwan's renowned Cloud Gate Dance Theatre. She made a
similar trip to Italy and Spain in June and July.</P>

      <P>Taiwan should prioritize several industries in follow-up talks with China under
the framework trade pact the two signed in late June to counter a possible East
Asian free trade zone, the Bureau of Foreign Trade (BOFT) said Friday.</P>
      <P>The BOFT said the service, petrochemical, steel, machinery, electronics and
automobile industries should top the agenda in future negotiations under the
economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) so that they would remain
competitive in China's market even if China, Japan and South Korea form a free
trade union.</P>
      <P>The bureau made the suggestion in a report on the progress of a free trade
agreement among the three nations and its impact on Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The report noted that a private study conducted jointly by China, Japan  and
South Korea in December  2008 concluded  that the establishment of a free trade
zone of the three countries could optimize their interests.</P>
      <P>It could boost Japan's GDP by 0.3 percent, China's GDP by 0.4 percent, and South
Korea's GDP by 2.8 percent, the study said.</P>
      <P>The bureau's report said the three countries have signed FTAs with other
countries or regions in recent years that have adversely impacted Taiwan's
exports, and if the three were to sign an FTA, then its threat to Taiwan could
be even greater.</P>
      <P>The BOFT also said that the threat of ASEAN plus three (China, Japan, South
Korea), which is still being negotiated, was bigger than the existing ASEAN plus
one (China), as all of Taiwan's major trading rivals would be economically
integrated.</P>

      <P>The National Health Research Institutes (NHRI) said Friday it was seeking
pharmaceutical manufacturers to produce a vaccine targeting enterovirus 71
(EV71) , a deadly virus that killed 78 children during a 1998 outbreak in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>A public screening of companies has been launched and will continue until Sept.
8, the NHRI said, adding that human testing could begin as early as September.</P>
      <P>Although research into making the vaccine has been conducted since 1998, the
NHRI wasn't able to establish a reliable technique until March this year.</P>
      <P>The technique involves the use of a Vero cell culture, part of a cell line
originally isolated from an African green monkey's kidney.</P>
      <P>The manufacturer will be required to produce the vaccine in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Enteroviruses are a large family of viruses responsible for many infections in
children. EV71 is one of the major causes of hand, foot and mouth disease, and
is sometimes associated with central nervous system diseases such as meningitis
and encephalitis. Newborns and toddlers are most vulnerable to EV71.</P>

      <P>An amendment that stipulates legislative constituencies remain unchanged for 10
years could be unconstitutional, the nation's top election official said Friday.</P>
      <P>Central Election Commission (CEC) Chairman Rai Hau-min was referring to an
amendment to the Public Officials Election and Recall Act that cleared the
legislature during its extra session last week.</P>
      <P>Rai said that the CEC "stands by its view that the amendment could be
unconstitutional, " adding that he had previously expressed such a view during a
legislative committee.</P>
      <P>Rai made the remarks after meeting  opposition  Democratic Progressive Party
Legislator William Lai, who is running in the year-end Tainan municipality
election.</P>
      <P>"I've come to visit Rai because the amendment violates the Constitution," Lai
said.</P>
      <P>Lai said that after the merger of Tainan City and Tainan County, the new
municipality will see its legislative seats increase to six from the present
five because the Constitution stipulates that one legislator be elected for
every 300,000 people.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung municipality, on the other hand, could see one seat taken away.</P>
      <P>Lai accused the ruling Kuomintang of using its overwhelming majority in the
legislature to push through the amendment, which stipulates that the legislative
constituency will be based on the present one and will be reviewed every 10
years.</P>
      <P>Rai was nominated by President Ma Ying-jeou to serve as a justice on the
Constitutional Court and president of the Judicial Yuan earlier this week.  The
nomination is pending consent by the Legislative Yuan.</P>

      <P>Minister of Economic Affairs Shih Yen-shiang said Friday a controversial
petrochemical complex must be built to ensure the competitiveness of Taiwan's
petrochemical sector, but he acknowledged that safety and environmental concerns
had to be addressed.</P>
      <P>"The planned Kuokuang petrochemical plant must be built to avoid skewed
development of the industry or producers leaving Taiwan," Shih said at a news
conference.</P>
      <P>Admitting that there were legitimate environmental concerns, however, Shih said
the government would strengthen its role in strictly monitoring the sector to
put the minds of residents living near the complexes at ease while at the same
time maintaining an appropriate scale of production.</P>
      <P>Shih defined an appropriate scale as annual ethylene production of between 5
million and 6 million tons.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's beleaguered petrochemical industry was dealt a blow recently when two
fires broke out at the Formosa Plastics Group's petrochemical complex in Yunlin
County in July.</P>
      <P>Angry residents blockaded the complex to push for compensation for losses, and
they also complained about possible long-term health consequences from living
near the facility and demanded that the complex be shut down later this decade.</P>
      <P>The planned Kuokuang complex, which has faced even stronger resistance, would
replace the fifth naphtha complex operated by state-run CPC Corp., Taiwan, which
the government committed 20 years ago to relocating in 2015.</P>
      <P>Opponents of the project, planned for Tacheng Township in Changhua  County,  say
it would threaten the survival of the Indo-Pacific Humpback Dolphin, which live
along Taiwan's western coast, and deal a severe blow to the country's efforts to
reduce emissions.</P>
      <P>Environmentalists launched a movement to buy back the land and want the project
canceled, but Shih said Tacheng Township is the only place the complex could be
built.</P>
      <P>"The plot of more than 1,000 hectares in Tacheng is the last hope of Taiwan's
petrochemical industry. Considering the scarcity of land in Taiwan, there is no
other parcel of land that is such an ideal base for petrochemical companies to
set up a production facility, " Shih said.</P>
      <P>The minister contended that the Kuokuang project is a vital investment for
Taiwan's economy because it cannot enjoy persistent growth without a sound
petrochemical industry.</P>
      <P>Without the complex, midstream and downstream producers would be likely to leave
Taiwan, leaving the local industry out of balance. At the same time, the CPC
Corp. chain would be weakened, reducing the competition faced by the Formosa
Plastics Group, he added.</P>
      <P>Shih said the government's top priority now is to strike a balance between
development and the environment.</P>

      <P>The Taipei District Court sentenced former Navy captain Kuo Li-heng to 15 years
in prison Friday for taking bribes in the Ministry of National Defense purchase
of Lafayette frigates from France.</P>
      <P>The court also ruled that US$17.6 million in kickbacks Kuo received from an arms
broker, which is now being held by prosecutors after being returned to Taiwan
from a Swiss bank account, be seized by the government.</P>
      <P>The court found Kuo's brother, Kuo Wen-tien, guilty of helping launder money
that was deposited in the pair's bank accounts in Switzerland, and sentenced him
to two years in prison.</P>
      <P>Kuo Li-heng, a former Navy weapons procurement officer, is already serving a
life sentence handed down by a military court in 1994 over another bribery case.</P>
      <P>The 1991 procurement of six naval frigates by the Navy from the French company
Thomson-CSF, which has changed its name to Thales SA, was complicated by a
procurement kickback scandal that came to light after the body of Navy officer
Yin Ching-feng was found floating off the coast of northern Taiwan in December
1993. Yin was widely suspected to have been murdered because he was about to
blow the whistle on the kickback scandal.</P>
      <P>Investigators found that arms dealer Andrew Wang had wired a total of
US$17,588,141 in four installments to the brothers' bank account in Switzerland
between December 1991 and September 1993. His brother helped him manage the
money after Yin was murdered.</P>
      <P>Under joint investigation of prosecutors, the military and the police, the
US$520 million bribery scandal surfaced in the following years. In 2000, Wang
was found to have deposited in a Swiss bank the huge sum he received from the
French company for securing the US$2.5 billion deal. Wang has been wanted by the
Taiwanese government since 2000 as a murder suspect and is still at large.</P>
      <P>In 2001, a prosecutor's office in Switzerland demanded that Wang's Swiss bank
account be frozen. Meanwhile, the Taiwanese government submitted an appeal to
the International  Court of Arbitration under the International Chamber of
Commerce in Paris, asking for compensation for bribes and kickbacks involving
the former Thomson-CSF.</P>
      <P>In 2003, then-French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas confirmed the existence of
the huge commission in the Lafayette deal.</P>
      <P>The International Court of Arbitration ruled in May 2010 that Thales pay US$591
million to the Taiwanese government for violating the contract by paying
commissions. Thales currently has an appeal filed with a higher court.</P>
      <P>While the Taiwanese government has sought to have the money in Wang's account
returned to Taiwan, Wang has since 2003 filed appeals to Swiss courts in hopes
the authorities will allow him to access the account.</P>
      <P>Until now, Swiss authorities have shown no signs of unfreezing the estimated
US$700 million now in Wang's bank account.</P>
      <P>Replying to an inquiry of the Central News Agency on Friday, Folco Galli, a
spokesman for the Swiss Justice Department, said that the Swiss authorities will
continue to freeze Wang's deposits until a sentence on Wang is "final and
executable."</P>

locked inside the manpower agency's office in Kaohsiung City, where the police
found other evidence related to the case, such as foreign workers' passports,
working visas and savings account passbooks, prosecutors said.</P>
      <P>The other victim was being held in a rooftop apartment.</P>
      <P>Following the police rescue of the foreign workers, some were deported from
Taiwan because their visas had expired, while others were being cared for by the
Kaohsiung County government's Labor Affairs Bureau.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors said their office, in cooperation with the Kaohsiung County
government Police Bureau and the Kaohsiung City Reconnaissance Brigade, also
summoned three executives of the manpower agency for questioning, and they were
later released on bail.</P>
      <P>The three individuals are also suspected of illegally forcing the victims to
work overtime and reducing their salary by all possible means, prosecutors said.</P>
      <P>Earlier this week, the husband of a female foreign worker, who was the victim
held in the rooftop apartment, reported to the Kaohsiung police that he had lost
contact with his wife for days.</P>
      <P>That triggered the police investigation and led to the rescue of the migrant

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's total fertility rate has been dropping in recent years, with a world
low of 0.94 births per woman predicted for this year.</P>
      <P>The decline in births will lead to a decrease in the young labor force,  which
will in turn slow the country's economy.  This demonstrates that giving birth to
children is an issue concerning the country's survival, and is the shared
responsibility of all citizens.</P>
      <P>In this sense, raising children is not a family affair, but a matter crucial to
preventing the aging of the entire country and society.</P>
      <P>Few countries facing the same problem have succeeded in boosting their birth
rate, mainly because the costs involved in child rearing are getting higher and
higher, leading many families to have less children and even give up parenthood

      <P>Data released recently by the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and
Statistics, the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of the Interior all show a
consistent trend: Taiwan's wealth gap is wider than 10 years ago.</P>
      <P>Besides an imbalanced industrial structure, the widening gap between the rich
and the poor can be attributed to the unfair tax system.</P>
      <P>Even though Taiwan is one of the few countries in the world that do not impose a
tax on capital gains, the government has been decreasing taxes for wealthy
people in recent years. Such improper tax reductions are leaving the government
in financial difficulty and having a direct impact on social welfare and
education spending.</P>
      <P>Three years ago,  President  Ma Ying-jeou  criticized  his predecessor Chen
Shui-bian as "failing to see the urgent need of the poor." With Ma in office for
more than two years now, the people want to ask if he has heard the voices of
the poor. (Editorial abstract -- Aug. 28, 2010)</P>

      <P>Embedded marketing is becoming a more and more acceptable means of advertisement
in modern world. An exception is Taiwan, which has been sticking to its
traditional mindset and imposes strict bans on product placement for television
programs.</P>
      <P>The Audiovisual Media Services Directive passed by the European Union in 2007,
which defines the conditions under which product placement is permitted, is an
example that Taiwan should follow.</P>
      <P>The National Communications Commission has since last year been working on a
proposal to amend the Satellite Broadcasting Act and the Cable Radio and
Television Act to relax the ban. Under the proposal, product placement would be
allowed in TV shows except for news and children programs.</P>
      <P>We urge the Executive Yuan and the Legislative Yuan to support the bill. For the
health of the public, however, the ban on embedded marketing should remain for
tobacco and alcoholic beverages.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan engineers lauded in Haiti, but excluded from reconstruction</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Port-au-Prince,  Aug 28 (CNA)
08/28/10  13:56:17

    <TEXT>
      <P>The deadly earthquake that struck Haiti in January dealt the Caribbean country
its most devastating blow in 200 years. The 35-second jolt killed more than
300,000 people, displaced 1.9 million and flattened 208,000 homes.</P>
      <P>According to the Haitian government's Action Plan for National Recovery and
Development of Haiti, more than 1,300 educational institutions and at least 50
hospitals and health centers were destroyed.</P>
      <P>All  but  one  government  building  were  demolished  in Port-au-Prince, the
nation's capital. Even the Presidential Palace and the National Cathedral, both
iconic structures of leadership and hope, were crushed.</P>
      <P>While almost the entire city was leveled, two buildings designed and built by
Taiwanese -- the National Public Health Laboratory and the dormitory of Tabarre
City University -- sustained the earthquake unharmed and remain fully functional
today.</P>
      <P>The AIDS research laboratory, which cost US$2 million and took a year and a half
to build, played a vital role in the four months after the earthquake by serving
as an ad hoc office for the World Health Organization (WHO) , said David Chang,
the director of the Haiti office for Overseas Engineering and Construction
Company (OECC), the firm credited for the two projects.</P>
      <P>OECC is an overseas construction company commissioned by the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs to head up Taiwan-sponsored public infrastructure and development
projects in Taiwan's allies in Central America, Africa and the South Pacific.</P>
      <P>Hsia Pei-ling, the general manager of the Taipei-based Overseas Investment and
Development Corp., the mother company of OECC, said that while he never imagined
the two buildings would be used in such a manner, it was fitting they would be
employed in the emergency.</P>
      <P>"I was not surprised at all when I heard all of the OECC construction projects
in Haiti were not damaged in the earthquake, because we only do top quality
works," he said.</P>
      <P>Seven months after the temblor, Port-au-Prince bears many scars of the
earthquake in the forms of huge heaps of debris on just about every corner,
half-toppled buildings, and people living out of tattered tents on the street.</P>
      <P>Chang, who has been heading up the Haiti office for almost a decade, said that
Haitian contractors often shortchange their clients by doing shoddy work, and
that the building code in the country is "nearly non-existent."</P>
      <P>In the 10 years that OECC has been in Haiti, its engineers and contractors have
completed over 30 major projects including bridges, roads, parks and government
buildings -- all of which, said Chang, were undamaged in the earthquake.</P>
      <P>"Frankly, we did not do anything out of the ordinary when we built the
projects," Chang said. "What we did was simply abide by the basic rules of
seismic retrofitting in construction, and that's how our buildings were able to
survive the earthquake."</P>
      <P>Hsia said that in order to cut down on costs, the OECC strives to use as much
local raw material as it can find. The company also hires many local laborers to
work on the projects as part of its pseudo-"cash-for-work" program.</P>
      <P>But despite the fact Taiwan has proven its engineering ingenuity and
construction ability, Hsia said OECC is not included in the multinational effort
on the territorial reconstruction  of the country.</P>
      <P>He said the reason is that many huge foreign conglomerates that he refused to
name have already staked claims on the US$9.9 billion donation pledged by the
international community to rebuild Haiti.</P>
      <P>"These big companies know there is money to be made in situations like this.
OECC is considered a small-to-medium size company compared to them, so it will
be unlikely that we will get a piece of that pie," Hsia said.</P>
      <P>But not all is lost, he said. Although OECC might never receive any of the
pledged money, the Haitian government has sought the company's advice on small
projects that will be paid for with money that isn't from the donations, Hsia
said, adding that OECC is always happy to share its experience with anyone
seeking advice.</P>
      <P>"Our strategy is simple. Just use the correct material and do honest work,"
Chang said.</P>

      <P>The number of disadvantaged households rose nearly 27 percent to 15,077 in the
first six months of this year, with 90,146  people receiving  financial
assistance  from the government, the Ministry of the Interior said Saturday.</P>
      <P>The government provided NT$228.9 million (US$7.2 million) to disadvantaged
families from January to June, up 20 percent from the same period last year.</P>
      <P>The ministry said that the number of hardship families increased because of an
amendment last year that made single fathers and those families in which
grandparents raise their grandchildren eligible for government subsidies and
allowances.</P>
      <P>The number of male parents applying for government help increased nearly 118.6
percent in the six-month period, compared to a 20.7 percent rise for female
parents.</P>
      <P>Female applicants still accounted for nearly 89.6 percent of the total
applicants, the ministry said.</P>
      <P>The Act for Assisting Families in Hardship -- originally aimed mostly at taking
care of women -- was first implemented in March 2008. It was amended last year
to include eligible single fathers, grandparents, and people under the age of 65
whose spouse has died.</P>
      <P>The amendment also increased education subsidies for households with children in
college and lifted some restrictions to allow more victims of domestic violence

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwanese architects invited visitors at the 12th Venice Architecture Biennale
to "Take a Break" in a former prison at the opening ceremony of the Taiwan
Pavilion in Venice, Italy on Friday.</P>
      <P>"In Venice's summer heat, people want to relax in a space without constraint,
and that was the impetus for the design of the pavilion, " said Tseng Wei, the
41-year-old leader of the architect delegation from Taiwan. "I hope the air-
conditioned space and beverages will attract them into the pavilion."</P>
      <P>With the theme of "Take a Break -- Spatial Variability in Contemporary Taiwan, "
the Taiwan Pavilion has turned the Palazzo delle Prigioni, a former prison built
in the 16th century, into a comfortable salon.</P>
      <P>This marks the sixth time Taiwanese architects have participated in the biennial
event, which was founded in 1980 as part of the Venice Biennale, a major art
exhibition held on alternate years with the architecture show. The event opened
on Aug. 26 and runs through Nov. 21.</P>
      <P>Tseng and his Taichung-based Red Space Design Association beat out 10 other
architecture teams for the chance to design the pavilion.</P>
      <P>"Take a Break" is also meant to suggest a metaphor  for contemporary Taiwan,
which he said was undergoing a release of political and social tensions as
relations with China improve.</P>
      <P>David Tseng, a professor at National Chiao Tung University's Graduate Institute
of Architecture and promoter for the opening ceremony, said the installation of
the exhibit was a challenge because using nails or bolts to attach items to the
walls is prohibited in the historic building.</P>
      <P>Instead, the group used floating air cushions to create a false ceiling and make
the space more approachable to identify with the biennial's theme, "People meet
in architecture."</P>
      <P>"The design will bring people closer and redefine the meaning of this kind of a
space, " David Tseng said.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's Chien Yu-chin admitted to being tired at the end of play Friday at the
2010 World Badminton Championships in Paris, but she wasn't complaining after
reaching the semifinals of both the women's and mixed doubles.</P>
      <P>Chien and partner Cheng Wen-hsing, seeded third in the women's doubles and
considered Taiwan's most serious threats for a top showing in badminton's most
prestigious annual tournament, reached the final four with a 21-14, 21-17
victory over eighth-seeded Hyun Young-yoo and Jung Kyung-eur of South Korea.</P>
      <P>The pair, the only team not from China left in the event, will face second seeds
Du Jing and Yu Yang of China in the semifinals.</P>
      <P>Both Chien and Cheng voiced excitement about the win -- their best-ever
performance at the World Championships -- and said they looked forward to
battling Du and Yu, whom they have never beaten.</P>
      <P>"We'll be able to just let it loose tomorrow," Cheng said.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, Chien partnered with Lee Sheng-mu in mixed doubles to stun
the 10th-seeded Chinese duo of Tao Jiaming and Chang Yawen 14-21, 21-18, 21-17
in 57 minutes, considered a marathon in badminton.</P>
      <P>It was the third come-from-behind three-set match the 16th seeds have played in
four matches, with their only straight set win coming against seventh-seeded
Koreans Lee Yong-dae and Lee Hyo Jung in the third round.</P>
      <P>That sent them into the quarterfinals against Tao and Chang.</P>
      <P>The two will now face sixth-seeded He Hanbin and Yu Yang of China in the
semifinals, hoping to continue their surprise run, and Chien vowed not to give
in to fatigue.</P>
      <P>"I'm very tired, but the whole point of coming out to play in a tournament is to
not go home empty-handed," she said.</P>
      <P>Lee also had a chance to reach a second semifinals in the men's doubles, but he
and Fang Chieh-min, seeded sixth in the event, fell to second seeds Markis Kido
and Hendra Setiawan of Indonesia 21-14, 21-14 in 31 minutes.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's last two singles players still alive at the World Championships also
were eliminated in the quarterfinals of their respective events Friday.</P>
      <P>In men's singles, unseeded Hsueh Hsuan-yi shocked fourth-seeded Chen Jin of
China by winning the first set, but was unable to maintain  the momentum and
eventually  lost their quarterfinal encounter 22-24, 21-5, 21-13 in 64 minutes.</P>
      <P>In women's  singles,  unseeded  Cheng  Shao-chieh  fell to fourth-seeded Tine
Baun of Denmark 21-18, 21-13 in 34 minutes.</P>
      <P>Cheng won the Yonex Open Chinese Taipei 2010 in early August, and continued her
good form with wins over the 14th and eighth seeds at the World Championships in

    <HEADLINE>Talk of the day -- Taiwan-made helmets impress French designer</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>08/28/10  17:32:49
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A helmeted model at French designer Michel Klein's Taipei fashion show made it
onto the front page of a local newspaper, which said the event presented a new
breakthrough in fashion.</P>
      <P>Following Taiwan-made Giant bikes, made-in-Taiwan motorcycle helmets could be
the next item to lead Taiwan into the world of fashionable living, the paper
said.</P>
      <P>The following is an except from the paper's coverage of the subject: United
Daily News:</P>
      <P>Michel Klein praised the great variety of styles and designs of the helmets that
Taiwanese motorcyclists wear. "Taiwan's safety helmets are the best product I
have ever seen, " said the fashion designer while shopping at local helmet shop
"MoTo."</P>
      <P>In Paris, he said, it is considered "gauche" to drive a car but fashionable to
ride a motorcycle. However, unlike in Taiwan, the prices of helmets in France
are too high with too few options available, said Klein, who sells his designs
to nearly 30 countries.</P>
      <P>Encouraged by a successful fashion show at the "Taipei In Style" exhibition at
the Nangang World Trade Center Aug. 27, Klein disclosed that he hopes to
cooperate with the Taiwanese producer of the helmet he used in the show in an
attempt to transform the Taiwan-made helmets into a stylish fashion accessory.</P>
      <P>Tai Nung-chia, the 29-year-old owner of the MoTo helmet chain store, began the
business when he was 23, and now has six outlets, each generating revenues of
NT$14 million (US$438,000) a year.</P>
      <P>Tai was one of Taiwan's pioneers of hand-painted helmets, finding success in
treating the indispensable accessory for local motorcyclists as a canvas for
painting.</P>
      <P>Klein was not the only foreign professional attracted by the helmets at MoTo
stores. Tai said a French racer had ordered a helmet with a painting after being
impressed by the helmets displayed at one of his outlets.</P>
      <P>In seven years, Tai has created nearly 40 exclusive designs for motorcycle
helmets. Each of the designer items has an average price of NT$1,000.</P>
      <P>Traffic police, however, are not big fans of Tai's creative helmets. Fang Ying-
ning, head of the Taipei City traffic police department, said the police
discourage riders from fooling around with their helmets out of safety concerns.</P>
      <P>In a normal situation, traffic police normally ask riders who wear "strange
helmets" to stop for safety checks, Fang said, stressing that there are
regulations stipulating helmet safety standards. Helmets that have not passed
safety tests and received certification are not allowed on the road. (Aug. 28,

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC), the world's largest contract chip
maker, announced Saturday that work on its first thin film solar cell plant is
expected to begin in September.</P>
      <P>Rick Tsai, president of TSMC's new businesses division, said the new plant will
focus on developing modules for copper indium gallium diselenide (CIGS) thin-
film solar cells, after it entered the silicon solar cell sector by purchasing a
20 percent stake in Motech Industries Inc., Taiwan's biggest solar cell maker,
in January.</P>
      <P>Addressing the opening ceremony of a green job fair, Tsai also said machines and
equipment will be installed in TSMC's LED research and development center and
plant in Hsinchu beginning next month.</P>
      <P>Construction on the plant began last March and mass production is expected in
2011.</P>
      <P>TSMC has aggressively moved into the solar industry this year, not only becoming
Motech's single largest shareholder, but also acquiring a 21-percent stake in
U.S. solar photovoltaic company Stion in July to obtain thin-film solar cell
technology.</P>
      <P>Industry  analysts believe that TSMC's main rival,  United Microelectronics
Corporation (UMC), is ahead of TSMC in the thin-film solar cell market, as UMC
established its own thin-film solar cell company NexPower Technology Corp. in
2005. NexPower has already entered mass production.</P>
      <P>"TSMC  believes  that  its past  experience  in developing semiconductor
businesses will help speed its growth in the green energy industry, " said Tsai,
who previously served as president and chief executive officer of TSMC from 2005
to 2009.</P>
      <P>Tsai said TSMC is expected to recruit at least 500 people to help develop its
green energy businesses in the next 12 months.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Sino-American Silicon Products Inc., Taiwan's top maker of wafers for
solar cells, also said at the job fair that it will increase its workforce from
2,400 to 6,000, in five years.</P>
      <P>Sino-American  Chairman  Lu Ming-kuang  said  the company's consolidated
revenues grew 80 percent year-on-year in the first six months of this year and
predicted full-year revenues would surpass NT$21 billion, growing to NT$60
billion to NT$65 billion in 2015.</P>

      <P>Stung by a string of mishaps at Taiwan's main international airport, authorities
there hope to bring back former airport workers to help give the facility a new
lease on life, the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) said Saturday.</P>
      <P>CAA officials acknowledged, however, that it will not be an easy task to
persuade  them to return to work at Taiwan  Taoyuan International Airport
because many took preferential early retirement packages to leave their jobs.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC) ordered the CAA to hire
back some of the best-performing retirees -- many of whom are still under 55
years of age and have good engineering and management savvy -- to help the
airport cope with its current woes as it moves toward privatization, according
to CAA officials.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan's largest airport is slated to become a private airport company in
November, and many airport workers have applied for early retirement out of
concern of facing bleak prospects and a loss of benefits under the new regime.</P>
      <P>To find the root cause of the many problems at the airport, including leaky
restrooms, poor facilities, expensive food and staff misconduct, the MOTC has
been holding meetings almost every day with officials from supervisory agencies.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, airport authorities are planning to recruit some 50 new staffers,
mostly engineers, in September.</P>
      <P>A Taoyuan Airport Improvement Task Force, set up in July by the MOTC, has
described the three-decades old airport as being "very ill" and vowed to raise
its current world ranking from 27th to the top 10 in three years.</P>
      <P>According to the results of a survey conducted by the panel between July 23-27
at Taoyuan Airport's two terminals, passengers are mostly dissatisfied with 16
of the most important services at the airport, such as the high cost of food,
the airport's surrounding landscape, defective luggage trolleys and unclear
direction signs in the transit area.</P>

      <P>Taiwan held its first ever job fair for the green energy industry Saturday,
another initiative in boosting the industry's share of the overall economy in
coming years.</P>
      <P>More than 200 local companies including AU Optronics Corp. (AUO), Taiwan
Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) , Hiwin Technologies Corp. and Nanya
Technology Corp., offered more than 10,000 related jobs at the fair.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is widely considered to be one of the countries that have the strength to
develop a viable green energy industry, Economics Minister Shih Yen-shiang said
at a ceremony formally opening the one-day event.</P>
      <P>"The green energy industry  in Taiwan has the support of well-developed
semiconductor, photonics, machinery, materials and electronics industries," he
said.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan aims to play a leading role globally in the field of green energy

Taipei-based 1111 Job Bank, which co-organized the one-day event.</P>
      <P>In his address at the opening ceremony, Premier Wu Den-yih expressed hope that
the green energy industry will become one of Taiwan's main economic powerhouses.</P>
      <P>"We hope that the green energy industry will be a leading force behind Taiwan's
economic growth in the future, " he said. "We also hope that industries with
high efficiency and high value but with low carbon emissions will take root in
Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Taiwan's green energy industry will generate an output value of over NT$200

      <P>The output of the industry is expected to reach NT$1.16 trillion by 2015, the
bureau estimated.</P>
      <P>The job fair attracted a total of 16,000 job seekers, the job bank said.</P>
      <P>An Aug. 23 poll by the job bank shows that 76 percent of local office workers
intend to become "green collar" workers as many of them were bullish about the
green energy industry's prospects and supporting environmental protection.</P>
      <P>Huang Yong-sheng, a 27-year-old job seeker who majored in computer science, told
the Central News Agency that he visited the fair because he saw the green energy
industry as "a future trend and thus wanted to enter the field."</P>
      <P>However,  more than 55 percent  of the poll's respondents considered the lack of
proper government promotion or the lack of private investment to be one of the
major hurdles for green energy development in Taiwan, the survey found.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Civic groups call for reform as education conference opens</HEADLINE>

      <P>Civic groups called for education reform on a wide range of issues, including
attention on special education, a 12-year compulsory education system and
deregulation on the sidelines of the National Education Conference in Taipei on
Saturday.</P>
      <P>The two-day conference at the National Central Library gathered officials,
teachers and representatives of civic groups from across the country with the
aim of formulating "an education policy that will pave the way for Taiwan's
'golden decade, '" according to Minister of Education Wu Ching-ji.</P>
      <P>The conference, which was the first of its kind in 16 years, planned to discuss
10 central themes, including the education system in general, higher education,
special education, faculty training, internationalized campuses and education,
and lifelong learning.</P>
      <P>Across from conference, civic groups gathered to highlight issues related to
education.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan's education problems will not be solved by a conference, especially one
that excludes people who have been working at the front line of education and
spend time with students and children every day, " Lu Jen, a professor at Ming
Chuan University, told the media in a "civic education conference" that was
called by more than a dozen civic organizations.</P>
      <P>"Deregulation is key in Taiwan's education reform. Taiwan's food culture has
prospered  without the government  holding a food conference. The same results
can happen for education," Lu said.</P>
      <P>He called for the government to "take its hands off" education and let
institutions develop under a free market concept.</P>
      <P>In his opening speech at the conference, President Ma Ying-jeou said there was
still a lot of work to do in developing the education system, but added that
"Taiwan must have done something right" to allow Taiwanese students to shine in
international competitions and continue its impressive technological
development.</P>
      <P>Ma stated several priorities of his education policy, such as narrowing the
financial gap between public and private institutions, increasing student
exchanges and improving the quality of vocational education. He also highlighted
the importance of making adjustments for Taiwan's low birth rate, which the
Council for Economic Planning and Development has projected will be the lowest
in the world this year.</P>
      <P>Outside the conference, representatives from civic groups voiced their concerns.
The implementation of a 12-year compulsory education system should be a priority
because the high school enrollment system puts too much pressure on students,
said Hsieh Kuo-ching, president of the National Alliance of Parents
Organization.</P>
      <P>The current compulsory education system, which has been in place since 1968,
requires six years of elementary school and three years of junior high school.</P>
      <P>"We demand a timetable for implementation, because the discussion of a 12-year
compulsory education has been going on for more than a decade but nothing has
been done," he said.</P>
      <P>Kuo Hsin-mei,  president  of the Association  for Learning Disability in Taiwan,
said that special education needs have not been addressed by the government at
all, which she said was obvious because there isn't a single agency under the
Ministry of Education to handle special education issues.</P>
      <P>Khoo Jih-perng, an associate professor at Taipei Municipal University of
Education who represents an academic alliance calling for the passage of a bill
on childhood education and child care, said Taiwan lacks a preschool education
policy.</P>
      <P>Khoo said Taiwan needs a policy that integrates education and social welfare
resources to tackle the issue of working parents not having  enough money for
child care and preschool  education, especially single-parent families.</P>
      <P>Other representatives urged the government to increase the budget for lifelong
learning and carry out teacher evaluation at all levels to ensure high-quality
education for students.</P>
      <P>The conference concludes Sunday. Education Minister Wu said that his ministry
would incorporate the results of the conference and that it aimed to release an
education white paper by the end of the year as a blueprint for future policy.</P>

      <P>A Taiwanese children's group will stage a self-created musical featuring
performers in various dog costumes in September to help raise the public's
awareness of stray animal protection, the troupe said Saturday.</P>
      <P>If Kids Theater Company will put on the Chinese-language musical free of charge
and outdoors in the southern port city of Kaohsiung on Sept. 4 and the central
city of Taichung on Sept. 11, the troupe announced at an event in Taipei.</P>
      <P>At the event, some members of the troupe unveiled part of the Chinese-language
musical, attracting a crowd of parents and children to watch.</P>
      <P>The musical tells a story of how a family dog is abandoned by its owner and
meets other stray dogs on the street.</P>
      <P>"We want to use this musical to show how happy dogs are when their owners love
and care for them, " said Chao Tzu-chiang, the head of the troupe and the
musical's writer.</P>
      <P>The troupe first launched the production in 2002, but it has now expanded it
with new elements.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Carrefour Cultural and Educational Foundation, which is sponsoring
the musical performances, hopes that the performances will educate children
about the plight of stray dogs.</P>
      <P>"We hope to teach the future generation how to respect life through the musical,
" Winson Wu, chief executive of the foundation, told the Central News Agency at
the event.</P>
      <P>The Taipei event also featured a number of booths that allowed the public to
adopt strayed cats and dogs or encouraged them to make donations.</P>
      <P>At the event, the foundation also awarded a winner out of 143 dogs in a talent
show and the troupe offered it an opportunity to "act" in the musical.</P>

      <P>The aging of Taiwan's society has sparked a fundamental change in the country's
consumer market, with demand growing for nutritional supplements and functional
daily devices that help senior citizens live more comfortably and conveniently.</P>
      <P>According to leading department stores, vitamins and other supplements along
with health care products have became increasingly popular in the capital city
of Taipei, in line with the country's growing over-65 population.</P>
      <P>Dayeh Takashimaya Department Store in the Tianmu commercial circle in suburban
Taipei said its sales of products targeting senior consumers have grown steadily
in recent years.</P>
      <P>That growth has been particularly evident this year, the retailer said, citing
statistics showing sales at a pharmacy in the department store between January
and July growing 7-10 percent year-on-year, with vitamins and nutritional
supplements accounting for 40-50 percent of total revenue.</P>
      <P>Aside from nutritional supplements, there has also been growing interest in
handy daily appliances catering to older consumers, Dayeh Takashimaya said.</P>
      <P>The trend is not likely to fade anytime soon. The proportion of Taiwan's
population aged 65 or over has gone from 8.62 percent in 2000 to 10.6 percent in
2009 and is expected to hit 14 percent by 2017, according to government
statistics and estimates.</P>
      <P>Also,  the country's  aging  index  --  the ratio of the over-65-year-old
population to the population of people aged between 0-14 -- was the second
highest in Asia in 2009, trailing only Japan.</P>
      <P>Another major retailer in Taipei, Pacific Sogo Department Stores, said it has
also felt the impact of the demographic changes. It said it plans to open more
counters selling items catering to seniors because sales of such goods have
demonstrated steady growth.</P>
      <P>According to the department stores, the most popular items in the senior market
are imported from Japan, whose society began aging 20-30 years earlier than
Taiwan's.</P>
      <P>The products range from rolling walkers and light and folding crutches to ultra-
light walking shoes and necklaces with magnifying glasses attached.</P>
      <P>The retailers predicted that commercial opportunities related to elderly
consumers would become as ripe as those in Japan within three to five years and
expected more products geared to this market to be introduced in Taiwan in the
near future.</P>

      <P>A group of designers have opened an exhibition that encourages people to carry
out the idea of carbon reduction by making innovative tools in their daily
lives, a promoter of the exhibition said at a press conference Saturday.</P>
      <P>A total of 30 innovative works made by 42 inventors, including 37 from Taiwan
and five from the United States, will be demonstrated at the CMP Block in
Taichung from Aug. 27-Sep. 26 on the first stop of the exhibition's tour around
central and northern Taiwan, said Tony Chang, chief executive of the Taiwan
Design Center.</P>
      <P>Chang said the exhibition, entitled "Love Tomorrow Today, " originated in the
United States with the aim of sharing the concept of creativity in life and
implementing carbon reduction ideas with creative devices.</P>
      <P>"This is the first time such a practical concept of environmental protection has
been introduced to Taiwan, " he said. "By creating useful tools and optimizing
natural resources today, we can envision a better life tomorrow."</P>
      <P>Chang highlighted one of the displays -- a camping tent made of plastic bottles
and bamboos. He said the tent is designed to encourage city residents to get
outside and cherish the natural resources around them.</P>
      <P>The exhibition will also be incorporated as a part of the 2010 Taiwan Design
Expo in Taipei on Dec. 11-19, and make its final appearance in three
international hotels in Taipei from Dec. 24 this year to Feb. 20, 2011.</P>

      <P>Adequate exercise designed by professionals has proven effective in helping
prevent cardiac patients from having a heart attack, with the fatality rate
reduced by at least 25 percent, a doctor said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Wei Jeng, director of the heart center at Cheng Hsin General Hospital, said
exercise is not necessarily unsuitable for myocardial infarction or heart-
transplant patients as most people think.</P>
      <P>"A good exercise therapy program can reduce the risk factors for heart attack, "
Wei said. "It not only can improve cardiovascular sclerosis, some patients even
recovered so well that an operation was no longer needed, " he said at an event
introducing the hospital's exercise therapy program.</P>
      <P>Several cardiac patients also shared their experiences from the hospital's
therapy program.</P>
      <P>David Sun, often dubbed the "godfather" of Taiwan's advertising industry who has
four heart stents, said he successfully completed a 1,668-kilometer bike journey
in China within 20 days in May 2009 after receiving the hospital's therapy for
months.</P>
      <P>"Most of my friends thought it would be inconceivable for me, a cardiac patient,
to take on such a journey that even normal people considered difficult," Sun
recalled.</P>
      <P>Sun Yueh, an award-winning actor-turned-volunteer who suffers from
cardiovascular disease and was operated on for lung cancer a few years ago, said
he was not even able to ride an indoor-training bike for one minute when he
began the therapy.</P>
      <P>"But within one month, I was able to ride for 24 minutes without stopping," said
the 80-year-old Sun.</P>
      <P>Jacob Jou, a 57-year-old professor at National Sun Yat-sen University, said that
even though he suffered a serious heart attack in 2003, his health has greatly
improved after taking part in a three-month heart therapy program at the
hospital.</P>

      <P>Local opinion leaders from central Taiwan's Taichung area called Saturday for
locally grown fruit to be among the items received preferential tariff treatment
from China while meeting a visiting Chinese official.</P>
      <P>Legislator Yen Chin-piao and Taichung County Council Speaker Chang Ching-tang
issued the call during a banquet with Zheng Lizhong, vice president of the
quasi-official Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits, the Chinese
body authorized to deal with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He is visiting Taiwan, however, in his capacity as deputy director of the
Central Office of Taiwan Affairs of the Communist Party of China.</P>
      <P>"Many Taichung farmers are very disappointed that their high-end products were
not included on the first 'early harvest list, '" Chang told the Central News
Agency, referring to the list of items receiving favorable tariff treatment
under the economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) signed with China in
late June.</P>
      <P>"Therefore, I immediately suggested to Zheng that the next round of ECFA talks
discuss the inclusion of Taichung produced pears, lichees and loquats in the
second 'early harvest list,'" Chang said.</P>
      <P>Taichung County Councilwoman Yang Chiu-yun clamored for more frequent exchanges
between Taichung harbor and the ports of Fuzhou and Xiamen in China's Fujian
Province on the opposite side of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>"The strategic location of the Taichung Harbor allows it to play a pivotal role
in cross-strait cargo and passenger travel, which in turn will also help boost
prosperity and development in the greater Taichung area," she contended.</P>
      <P>Taichung Airport also stands a much better chance of attracting more passengers
based on the foundation laid by the ECFA, Yang said, urging the Chinese side to
authorize more flights between Taichung and Xiamen.</P>
      <P>Heading an eight-member delegation of Chinese officials, Zheng arrived in Taiwan
Aug. 22 at the invitation of a KMT think tank.</P>
      <P>Keeping a low profile on his trip, Zheng also visited the Kaohsiung and Tainan
areas in southern Taiwan, where anti-China sentiment is high.</P>

      <P>Showers of rain were expected to hit Taiwan Sunday as a tropical depression in
waters south of the Dongsha (Pratas) Islands in the South China Sea already
strengthened into a tropical storm early that day, the Central Weather Bureau
(CWB) said.</P>
      <P>The storm Lionrock has been moving directly toward southeastern China since its
formation at 2 a.m. Sunday and is not expected to cause any direct threat to
Taiwan, CWB officials said.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, they urged mariners navigating or operating in the Taiwan Strait,
Bashi Channel and waters south of China's Guangdong Province to exercise caution
against rough seas and rogue waves.</P>
      <P>Lionrock is the sixth typhoon in the Pacific region so far this year. With a
maximum sustained wind of 64.8 kph, the storm was centered in seas some 170
kilometers south of the Dongsha Island at 2 a.m. Sunday, according to CWB

    <TEXT>
      <P>Despite his slender and fragile body, Liu Yun-guo has a brave heart. At 79, he
is keenly aware of and amused by the fact that his life is fatefully linked to
English, English news-writing and Chinese-English dictionary compilation.</P>
      <P>Although he has a string of degrees, titles and accomplishments behind his name,
Liu, also known as David Hanson Liu, is absolutely self-deprecating.</P>
      <P>To promote  his  dictionary  --  the Chuan-shi  (Heritage) Chinese-English
Thesaurus, which he compiled single-handedly with 20 years of painstaking
effort, but with no publisher willing to print it due to its huge size and
possible lack of a market -- Liu peddles his 1,952-page tome on a Taipei street
teeming with cram schools and students.</P>
      <P>His sales schemes include buying one copy of the thesaurus and getting six free
steamed buns, which he and his 66-year-old wife make at home, or buying 60 buns
to get one free thesaurus.</P>
      <P>Some friends have tried to dissuade him from selling his book on the street,
saying it does not befit his social status and old age. His wife, who retired
from a successful career at Bank of Taiwan, has also tried in vain to stop him.</P>
      <P>"What status counts? It counts only when the book is sold and used, " said Liu,
who brings to mind Wu Xun, a legendary Qing dynasty beggar who saved every penny
he got from the streets to establish schools in order to provide youths with the
education that he had craved but could never get.</P>
      <P>The son of landlord parents in China's Shandong Province who were vilified after
the Chinese communists came to the fore, Liu fled to Taiwan with the Kuomintang
troops in 1949 as a boy soldier. A hard worker, he graduated from a military
officer candidate school before being assigned as a military inspector, working
under Gen. Sun Li-jen, then commander-in-chief of the Republic of China army.</P>
      <P>It was at that time Liu developed his close relationship with English, using all
his off-duty time and holidays to study the language.</P>
      <P>One day,  he became  so angry  with himself  for lacking self-discipline and
being easily distracted that he cut off his left little finger with a kitchen
knife. With the blood from the severed finger, he scrawled on a piece of paper:
"Yun-guo, shameful." He framed the blood scrawl and put it on his desk to serve
as a reminder.</P>
      <P>So great was his dedication to English that he decided to leave the military at
the age of 26 and enter civilian life because he just wanted to study English
full time.</P>
      <P>He split his time between studying in the daytime and pedaling a pedicab at
night to earn a living. While pedaling, he often retrieved his notebook from his
pocket to memorize a new vocabulary word. On his way home at midnight, there
would be few pedestrians on the streets and he would recite his lessons aloud
while pedaling.</P>
      <P>Eventually,  he passed  the hotly contested  joint college examination and
entered the prestigious National Chengchi University, where he was top scorer in
his class for five semesters and second in his class for three.</P>
      <P>Liu joined the English Department of the Central News Agency even before he
graduated from university to work as an English reporter and assistant editor.
However, his career there was brief, as a result of a short-lived and disturbing
marriage and some unfounded accusations against him because he was a right-hand
man of Sun, who was exiled to the United States by then-President Chiang Kai-
shek for his involvement in an attempted coup.</P>
      <P>He then worked at the Korean Embassy in Taiwan as an English secretary for a
period before joining the English-language daily China Post, where he honed his
skills as an English news reporter and made friends with many figures in Taipei'
s foreign diplomatic corps, who in turn helped improve his English. He published
his first English book, "English Writing and Reporting, " in 1976, dedicated to
professors Charles and Elizabeth Clayton and to professor Paul Hung-chun Wang,
who he said led his way into journalism.</P>
      <P>Robert J. Clarke, the then-director of the U.S. Information Service in Taiwan,
wrote in a foreward for the book that Liu had written a book intended to explain
the workings of his controversial profession and had succeeded in producing a
volume that should be useful not only to the beginning journalist but should
serve as a continuingly valuable reference work for those already in the trade.</P>
      <P>That volume was followed by another book, titled "Liu's Thesaurus of Commonly
Used English Expressions, " an 800-page production published in 1976 that was
the precursor of the ambitious "Chuan-shi Chinese-English Thesaurus."</P>
      <P>He opened his own translation company a few years later as an expansion of his
keen interest in English writing and translation, which later culminated in his
quixotic compilation of the giant Chinese-English thesaurus.</P>
      <P>Throughout his career, Liu was always troubled by the lack of usable Chinese-
English dictionaries. "None of them, including one compiled by Lin Yutang, could
solve my writing or translating problems because their entries were neither
graceful nor standard English, " he said. Lin is considered to be one of the
best writers and translators in contemporary Chinese history.</P>
      <P>In an attempt to address that deficiency and promote the use of graceful and
precise English, Liu spent 20 years reading English and American sinologists'
translations  and writings,  as well as international news agency dispatches.</P>
      <P>"Only Chinese speakers proficient in English can differentiate the graceful and
precise renderings from those which are not, " he said.</P>
      <P>On former Vice Premier Eric Liluan Chu's recent accusation of "the intolerant
humiliation" of Taiwanese students who lag so far behind their Japanese and
Korean counterparts in English proficiency as rated by an international
organization, Liu said he wonders how Chu would comment if he was aware of the
sheer number of glaring errors made in the official English-language  websites
of the government, leading Taiwanese companies and universities in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The most recent -- a slogan devised by the National Immigration Agency -- is a
case in point. "NIA -- We care what you care" has already been lambasted by
native English speakers for its complete lack of grammar, meaning or punch.</P>
      <P>An old dog now, Liu's wish to help raise the English proficiency level of the
Taiwanese public via his book remains strong.</P>
      <P>"I will devote my old bones to do anything toward that goal. The buns-for-books
drive on the street? It's nothing, if only the thesaurus can be distributed,"
the Taiwan Don Quixote said. By CNA staff writer Deborah Kuo/J</P>

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>While the soap opera-like conflict between two Taipei cram schools continues to
steal headlines, another scandal has erupted at a third cram school, which
allegedly bribed a data systems engineer to tamper with the scores of takers of
major national exams.</P>
      <P>Tung Shang-teh, an IT engineer at the National Vocational School Entrance
Examination Center, has recently been charged by prosecutors for taking bribes
worth some NT$4.25 million from the cram school to inflate the scores of some
test takers on their vocational school entrance exams.</P>
      <P>These cram school scandals were all results of money and greed. Running cram
schools in Taiwan has been a thriving and lucrative business because of the
country's questionable education policy. This business has also created a
colosseum where people kill each other because of greed.</P>
      <P>Cram schools have technically become part of Taiwanese students' daily life. The
government should waste no time to regulate this sector and avoid labeling  cram
schools  as "supplementary, " "temporary" or "short-term" any longer. (Editorial

    <DATELINE>08/29/10  14:38:21
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>First lady Chow Mei-ching will depart for Haiti later Sunday to see for herself
the situation in the Caribbean nation after it was devastated by a deadly
magnitude-7.3 earthquake Jan. 12 that claimed more than 300,000 lives and
displaced at least 1.5 million people.</P>
      <P>Describing the trip as a "journey of care and concern," Chow will visit Haiti in
her capacity as honorary president of the Red Cross Society of the Republic of
China and as a "Love Ambassador" for World Vision Taiwan (WVT) -- a Christian
charity. She will be accompanied by her daughter, Lesley Ma, on the trip.</P>
      <P>Chow has typically kept a low profile ahead of her overseas trip that will also
take her to the Dominican Republic, another of Taiwan's diplomatic allies. Only
the United Daily News carried a front-page report on her Haitian visit Sunday.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Liberty Times quoted a Wall Street Journal report as
characterizing 2010 as the "year of Taiwanese athletic dominance" after a number
of its baseball teams and individual athletes made their mark.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from local media coverage of the topics:</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>Chow has taken part in social welfare and post-disaster relief activities in
collaboration with local charities or social welfare groups in the past couple
of years. The Haitian trip will mark the first time that she has visited a
diplomatic ally of Taiwan on her own and not in the company of her husband.</P>
      <P>Instead of engaging in diplomacy, Chow will focus on visiting Haitian children
orphaned or displaced by the devastating earthquake, a WVT spokesman said.</P>
      <P>Her itinerary in Haiti will include meetings with orphans in Petionville and
Port-au-Prince as well as visits to a makeshift tent camp in Delmas. She will
also visit a Food For the Poor center to see first-hand the distribution of rice
donations from Taiwan. Taiwan has donated more than 400 tons of rice to Haiti
since January.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's government and people have launched many aid projects to help get
Haitian quake survivors back on track. WVT alone received NT$150 million
(US$4.69 million)  from Taiwanese  citizens for post-disaster rehabilitation
projects in Haiti.</P>
      <P>After her visit in Haiti, Chow will make a brief two-day stopover in the
Dominican Republic, where she will visit a job training center, two primary
schools, and a health center.</P>
      <P>During the trip, Chow will meet six children whom she and the president are
sponsoring in both countries, according to the WVT. She will bring gifts,
including story books, coloring books and ceramic flutes. The first lady is
scheduled to return to Taiwan on Sept. 5. (Aug. 29, 2010).</P>
      <P>Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>Several outstanding Taiwanese athletes have made their mark on the sports scene
this year, from golfer Yani Tseng winning two of the year's four majors in
women's golf and Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Kuo Hong-chih compiling a 1.37
earned-run average -- the best of any player with at least 40 innings pitched in
the National League -- to Jeremy Lin becoming the first Taiwanese-American
player to sign with an NBA team.</P>
      <P>Their achievements attracted the attention of the Wall Street Journal, which ran
an online article "Can Taiwan Keep the Streak Alive? "Saturday on the
developments.</P>
      <P>But these athletes tend to rely on their own efforts to stand out in the sports
world. The Sports Affairs Council, as the country's top sports administrative
agency, should do more to cultivate talent to help enhance Taiwan's visibility
on the world stage amid the country's diplomatic isolation imposed by China.

      <P>Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin admitted Sunday that problems with procurement
contracts handled by the city's government have dampened his popularity and
clouded his bid for a second term.</P>
      <P>"It is without a doubt a crisis, " admitted Hau, who said he had briefed
President Ma Ying-jeou and Kuomintang Secretary-General King Pu-tsung on the
problems and their political fallout.</P>
      <P>He quoted King as urging him to solve the problems as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The Apple Daily reported that Hau, who has enjoyed a narrow lead over Democratic
Progress Party (DPP) rival Su Tseng-chang in the polls since Su declared his
candidacy for the Nov. 27 mayoral election in March, lagged 1.56 percent behind
Su in the paper's latest survey.</P>
      <P>In the poll carried out Saturday among 770 adults aged 20 or older, Su received
44.68 percent support from respondents compared to 43.12 percent for Hau.</P>
      <P>The paper also said that more than 60 percent of respondents believed the
controversial city contracts to improve the city's Xinsheng Overpass will cost
Hau support in the election.</P>
      <P>The controversies arose Aug. 19 and Aug. 20, with two opposition councilors
charging separately that the contracted price for flowers to embellish the
elevated highway was unreasonable high.</P>
      <P>Another two city councilors charged on Aug. 27 that water pipes contracted for
the overpass were bought a price 10 times as high as the market price.</P>
      <P>The mayor replaced officials at the center of the controversies and ordered a
thorough investigation into the allegations Aug. 27 but it came too late to stop
the immediate damage to Hau's popularity.</P>
      <P>In a separate poll conducted Saturday by cable news station TVBS, Hau still
enjoyed a slim lead over Su, 51 percent to 49 percent.</P>
      <P>Su, whose DPP has generally lagged behind the ruling Kuomintang in the capital,
said the gaps were the narrowest ever seen between any DPP candidate and his or
her KMT rival in Taipei City.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The chairman of a local travel agency suggested Sunday that Taiwan make a more
concerted effort to enhance the appeal of its medical tourism sector, especially
as interest in visiting Taiwan for medical checkups is growing among Chinese
nationals.</P>
      <P>Jeff Chu, chairman of Grand Travel Inc., said the combination of sightseeing and
getting a checkup or other procedures done in Taiwan is very appealing to many
Chinese because Taiwan offers high-quality health care at a relatively low cost.</P>
      <P>At present, however, only a limited number of the more than 1 million Chinese
who visit Taiwan annually can receive medical services in Taiwan because of visa
and itinerary limitations, and Chu urged China's government to issue medical
visas to citizens who would like to get treatment or checkups in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He also recommended that Taiwan's medical institutions, health evaluation
centers and spas work together to develop a new, integrated travel option for
overseas visitors.</P>
      <P>Special customized tours, for example, could be arranged for people interested
in getting beauty and massage treatments and having micro-plastic surgery done,
he suggested.</P>
      <P>Customized services can also be arranged to cater to the needs of individuals,
such as people accompanying major trauma patients, who need to stay in Taiwan
for a longer period of time, Chu said.</P>
      <P>While Taiwan is celebrated for its beautiful scenery, cuisine, and friendly
people, its medical technology is also on a par with international  standards,
making it an ideal medical  tourism destination, he said.</P>
      <P>Medical tourism accounted for US$7.7 billion of the world's US$200 billion
medical market in 2005, and the Executive Yuan has listed medical services as
one of its core development industries in Taiwan.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's two doubles teams still alive at the 2010 Badminton World Championships
were denied spots in the finals of their respective events Saturday, falling
victim to higher ranked Chinese opponents and fatigue.</P>
      <P>On a day when players from China secured eight of the 10 spots in the finals of
the World Championships' five events, Taiwan's mixed doubles and women's doubles
teams were unable to resist the surge.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's  Lee Sheng-mu  and Chien Yu-chin,  having already outperformed their
status as the 16th seeds in the mixed doubles event, succumbed to sixth-seeds He
Hanbin and Yu Yang of China, 21-13, 21-8, in 29 minutes.</P>
      <P>Later in the day, Chien and Cheng Wen-hsing, seeded third in the women's
doubles, were knocked out by second seeds Du Jing and Yu Yang of China, 21-16,
21-15, in 33 minutes.</P>
      <P>The Chinese duo's quickness and precision shotmaking were the difference in a
match that often had the Taiwanese on the defensive.</P>
      <P>Chien, who admitted to being tired Friday after reaching the semifinals in both
the women's and mixed doubles, said after Saturday's matches that she had run
out of gas,  her energy particularly sapped by three three-set matches in the
mixed doubles earlier in the week.</P>
      <P>She did not feel that her Chinese rivals in the women's doubles were as
difficult to play as expected, but she praised them for consistently playing
shots to really good spots on court.</P>
      <P>Cheng said she enjoyed the tournament and was generally satisfied with her
team's bronze medal finish, but she admitted that she needed to improve her
serve in the future.</P>
      <P>China's Yu said her team's match against Cheng and Chien was "a real struggle"
at certain points in the encounter.</P>
      <P>But after having a poor run of form since the duo won the women's doubles gold
medal at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, Yu said she and Du were determined to win

      <P>Medical institutions that take measures to ensure that women will have a male
offspring is illegal and will result in fines or the voiding of doctors'
licenses to practice medicine, the Cabinet-level Department of Health (DOH) said
Sunday.</P>
      <P>A DOH working group will be established soon to investigate such illegal
practices at health institutions around the country, said Chiou Shu-ti,
director-general the DOH's Bureau of Health Promotion.</P>
      <P>The DOH investigators will regularly visit clinics and hospitals to probe
whether the gender of the babies born in their facilities are skewed toward
males, Chiou said.</P>
      <P>As in China, Taiwan has a bias in favor of male offspring because of the deeply
rooted preferences for sons in Chinese societies.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chiou said, the DOH will keep an eye on clinics and hospitals' usage
of the sex-detection reagent PCR and supplies of the reagent by biotechnology
firms, which are cashing in on a gray area involving the enzyme's production and
supply.</P>
      <P>"Relevant regulations will also be worked out by the DOH to more tightly clamp
down on illegal gender control of newborns," she said.</P>
      <P>At present, advertising "precise" gender detection services for pregnant women
who want to know the gender of their babies is illegal, subject to fines of up
to NT$250,000 (US$7,813) based on the Medical Care Act, she noted.</P>
      <P>Ob-gyn doctors who conduct sex-selective abortions are subject to fines up to
NT$500,000, and serious violators could have their medical licenses suspended.</P>
      <P>Based on the Medical Care Act, clinics and hospitals can have their operations
suspended or be deprived of their licenses in the event of such illegal

be incorporated into the overall planning of the MAC and Taiwan's intermediary
body, the Straits Exchange Foundation, before it can enter the negotiating stage
with China.</P>
      <P>Currently, Taiwan caps the number of Chinese students coming to Taiwan for
academic studies at 1,000 per year, but the actual number has reached around 200
a year so far, Chou said.</P>
      <P>"The ceiling can be adjusted in the future," he added.</P>
      <P>Also speaking at the conference, former Education Minister Yang Chao-shiang said
the government should pay greater attention to the needs of Taiwanese students
who travel across the strait to study in China.</P>
      <P>He cited the case of one Taiwanese student who was caught in a bind after
falling sick and needed an operation at midnight. The student's friends were
forced to ask a Taiwanese businessman for money to pay the hospital a guarantee
to make the operation possible.</P>
      <P>Chou responded that such concerns would be addressed in Education ECFA talks in
the future.</P>
      <P>Wu Ching-shan, director of the National Academy for Educational Research
Preparatory Office, said the two sides should clinch the Education  ECFA as soon
as possible to help systematize  and institutionalize educational exchanges
across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>He also suggested that plans for reciprocal visits by the two sides' education
officials should be made to help enhance the decision making process.</P>
      <P>On another discussion on academic organizations across the Taiwan Strait
cooperating in establishing schools, Lin said Taiwan will closely monitor how
funds flow between the two sides for that purpose.</P>

      <P>Heavy rain will hit Taiwan in the next few days now that a low pressure system
in waters east of Taiwan and south of the Japan-held Ryukyu Islands has
strengthened into a tropical depression, the Central Weather Bureau said.</P>
      <P>The depression has been moving slowly in a north-northwest direction and may
continue gathering strength to become a typhoon, the bureau said in a statement.</P>
      <P>It said another tropical depression in waters south of the Dongsha (Pratas)
Islands in the South China Sea had strengthened into a tropical storm at 2 a.m.
Sunday.</P>
      <P>Influenced by the two weather systems, the island will experience unstable
weather in the coming days, bureau meteorologists said.</P>
      <P>Some parts of Taiwan may even be hit by torrential rains, the bureau warned, and
it urged residents in low-lying and mountainous regions to remain vigilant
against flooding and mudslides.</P>
      <P>The bureau noted, however, that the tropical storm, named "Lionrock, " has been
heading directly toward southeast China since its formation early Sunday and is
not expected to cause a direct threat to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Still, vessels navigating or operating in the Taiwan Strait, Bashi Channel and
waters south of China's Guangdong Province should exercise caution against rough
seas and rogue waves, the bureau said.</P>
      <P>Lionrock is the sixth tropical storm in the Pacific region so far this year.
With maximum sustained winds of 64.8 kilometers per hour, the storm was centered
in seas some 170 kilometers south of the Dongsha Islands at 2 a.m. Sunday,
according to bureau meteorologists.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan suffers heartbreaking loss in Little League World Series</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Just two outs away from advancing to the Little League World Series title game,
Taiwan's Fu-Hsing Little League team from Kaohsiung crumbled and lost to Japan
3-2 in extra innings in the international final Saturday to end its championship
hopes.</P>
      <P>Entering the bottom of the sixth and final inning in regulation play with a 2-1
lead and star pitcher Huang Shao-fei, who had not yielded a hit to the Japanese
in 4 2/3 innings, on the mound, victory seemed within Taiwan's grasp.</P>
      <P>But Huang yielded a single to Koutaro Kamikura to lead off the inning, and then
with one man out, catcher Shih Hsun-hao threw the ball past the first baseman on
an ill-advised pickoff throw, sending Kamikura to second.</P>
      <P>That allowed Kamikura to score on a line drive single to center by Ryota
Norimatsu, which tied the game and shattered Taiwan's morale.</P>
      <P>Then in the bottom of the seventh, Japan benefited from a wild pitch by Huang
that advanced pinch-runner Ryusuke Ikeda and left him in position to score the
winning run on Ryo Motegi's bouncer up the middle, which found its way under the
glove of Taiwan's shortstop.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's manager Ho Tung-yo said the mistakes contributing to the gut-wrenching
defeat came from pressure.</P>
      <P>"What I worried about most happened, " he said. "As soon as Japan got a hit to
lead off the sixth, the kids got nervous and started making mistakes. In a game
that's so even, whoever makes mistakes is less likely to win."</P>
      <P>Ho, who felt Taiwan was subpar in all phases of the game, also felt the players
were adversely affected by a supporting crowd.</P>
      <P>"I warned them to ignore the crowd, but when they heard the crowd cheering for a
home run, they started overswinging," Ho lamented.</P>
      <P>Left-handed pitcher Wu Li Yung-heng admitted as much. "A lot of players
concentrated on the crowd rather than on the field," he said.</P>
      <P>But catcher Shih Hsun-hao made no excuses, describing the team's performance as
"terrible." "Our opponent wasn't really that strong. We lost the game
ourselves."</P>
      <P>Taiwan had not won a Little League World Series since 1996 after winning 17
between 1969 and 1996, but after outscoring opponents 92-1 in Asia-Pacific
qualifying and its first three World Series games in Williamsport, hopes were
high that the title-less streak would finally come to an end this year.</P>
      <P>Japan took a 1-0 lead in the first off of a nervous Chen Wei-chih, but Huang
came in with one out and a runner on third and shut out Japan until the fateful
sixth inning.</P>
      <P>Taiwan scored its two runs in the top of the second on three hits, a walk and a
wild pitch. But the team would only have one more hit the rest of the game,
allowing Japan to stay close.</P>
      <P>Despite the defeat, a group of fans who drove four hours every day to
Williamsport from Washington, D.C. expressed their pride in the team and
prepared 14 red envelopes, with US$100 dollars in each, for the 12 team members,
the coach, and trainer Hsu Shao-lun.</P>
      <P>Chinese Taipei will face Texas in the consolation game at 11 p.m. on Aug. 29

      <P>Taipei won one silver and three bronze medals in judo and a bronze medal in
badminton at the three-day Asia Junior Sports Exchange Games that concluded in
Tokyo on Sunday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's team from Taipei, along with teams from 15 other Asian cities, competed
for titles in the two sports.</P>
      <P>In the team badminton event, where teams played five matches against each other

, Taipei swept through the preliminary round with 5-0 whitewashings of defending
champion Jakarta and Yangon.</P>
      <P>But it lost to Kuala Lumpur 3-1 in the semifinals before defeating South Korea
3-1 for the bronze medal after winning the men's and women's doubles and men's
singles.</P>
      <P>Although Taipei failed to capture a medal in the judo team event, Kuo Yi-ting
from Taipei Datong High School won a silver medal in the women's under 70kg
class and three students from Taipei Dali High School won bronze medals in the
men's under 60kg, under 66kg, and open weight classes, respectively.</P>
      <P>For most of the athletes from Taipei, the event was their first opportunity to
compete abroad, and the team's coaches were positive about the athletes'
performance and said had they gained valuable experience from the trip.</P>
      <P>The three-day Games, hosted by Tokyo Sports Benefits Corporation, drew teams

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou presided over the opening of a sports center in Taipei's
Wenshan District Sunday and said he felt delighted that each of the city's 12
districts now had at least one multipurpose sports facility.</P>
      <P>"I am really happy that the plan, started by me with the building of the city's
first sports center in Zhongshan District, was completed by Mayor Hau with the
dedication of the Wenshan Sports Center," said Ma, who served as Taipei's mayor
from late 1998 to late 2006.</P>
      <P>Ma built six sports centers during his eight-year term, while his successor, Hau
Lung-bin, completed the other six.</P>
      <P>The president, who is himself an enthusiastic jogger, said many people didn't
exercise because of the scarcity of exercise facilities in the city, or because
of the long distances they had to travel to get to such facilities.</P>
      <P>That is no longer the case in Taipei, he said. "It is the government's job to
provide people with exercise places that are easily accessible and affordable.</P>
      <P>"I hope the sports centers, like EasyCards, will become one of the
administration's most popular policies, " Ma said, referring to the stored-value
cards used mainly to pay mass transit system fares and bus fares.</P>
      <P>Ma said his administration has pushed hard to boost the number of people in
Taiwan who exercise regularly, which now stands at 24.4 percent of the
population, with a high proportion of them in Taipei.</P>
      <P>To support the initiative to make exercise a lifestyle, Ma's government plans to
build 50 sports centers around the island, with 14 of them, evenly distributed
around northern, central, southern and eastern Taiwan, already in the planning
stages.</P>
      <P>Citing a plan drawn up by the Sports Affairs Council, the president said only
cities with a population of more than 150,000 could apply for grant from the
council to build sports centers.</P>
      <P>"As a trailblazer in this regard, Taipei may share its experience with other
cities."</P>
      <P>The Wenshan Sports Center is a seven-storey building with a floor space of

      <P>An ophthalmologist from Cardinal Tien Hospital in Sindian in Taipei County
successfully treated 42 cataract patients in Honduras during his two-week
mission to the Central American ally early this month.</P>
      <P>Yang Hsi-ming, director of the Ophthalmology Department of Cardinal Tien
Hospital, said Sunday that he arrived in the Honduran capital of Tegucigalpa on
Aug. 1 on a medical aid mission sponsored by Taiwan's International Cooperation
and Development Fund.</P>
      <P>"Ophthalmologists are much-needed in that country, which has only 75
ophthalmologists for a population of 7 million people, " Yang said in his office
at Cardinal Tien Hospital.</P>
      <P>"I had to treat about 500 patients a day. The clinic was overcrowded with people
seeking treatment, and police had to be called in to maintain order," Yang said.</P>
      <P>Due to the prevalence  of diabetes  and the scarcity  of ophthalmologists in
that country, cataracts are common in Honduras, and many patients end up losing
their vision, Yang said.</P>
      <P>A cataract is a clouding that develops in the crystalline lens of the eye and
obstructs the passage of light. It progresses slowly to cause vision loss and is
potentially blinding if untreated.</P>
      <P>A three-second surgical procedure that can cure the disease is not widely
available in Honduras, Yang said, recalling that a young woman who was
completely blinded by the disease regained 0.6 vision in one of her eyes the day
after she was operated on.</P>
      <P>During  his two-week  stay  in Tegucigalpa,  Yang operated successfully on 42
cataract patients, and he checked each of them again after their operations to
ensure that they were recovering well before returning home.</P>
      <P>Noting that he could only help a small portion of the cataract patients in that
country, Yang said it would be better to improve the country's public health and
people's diets there to prevent the disease.</P>
      <P>It was Yang's first mission to Honduras, but the third run by the International
Cooperation and Development Fund since launching an annual medical aid mission
to the Central American country in 2008.</P>
      <P>A total of eight doctors in various fields participated in this year's mission,
offering health care services at different hospitals around the country.</P>

      <P>to run as an independent, Kaohsiung County Magistrate Yang Chiu-hsing said
recently that current cross-strait relations are no longer a "relationship of
hostility."</P>
      <P>As a former DPP heavyweight, Yang's espousal could be the greatest possible
common ground for the development of cross-strait relations as well as politics
within Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Even the DPP, which now brands Yang a "traitor, " would not openly suggest that
Taiwan should remain hostile toward China.</P>
      <P>The DPP's Achilles' heel is its pro-independence ideology. "No unification" or
"temporarily no unification" -- as suggested by President Ma Ying-jeou for the
development of cross-strait relations -- will both contribute to peace in the
strait. Insisting on Taiwan independence, however, leaves just one path to take:
remaining hostile to China.</P>
      <P>The DPP has until now not forsaken its Taiwan independence proposition. It not
only brought Taiwan's cross-strait relations and political relations within
Taiwan to a level of "hostility" during the DPP's eight-year rule, but the party
itself has also been constrained by its pro-independence and anti-China
ideology.</P>
      <P>We probably cannot unify with China, now or ever, but maintaining peace with
China is imperative. Only through a "peaceful development" process can peace
eventually prevail across the strait. (Editorial abstract -- Aug. 30, 2010)</P>

    <HEADLINE>Talk of the day--U.S. concerned about retired generals' China visit</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>08/30/10  11:00:52
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taipei-based China Times prominently reported Monday that frequent visits to
China by retired Taiwanese generals in the past two years have caused U.S.
concern.</P>
      <P>The U.S. government has reportedly asked the administration of President Ma
Ying-jeou to explain its stance on such visits.</P>
      <P>The following is an excerpt from the daily's coverage of the development:</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>Jason Yuan, Taiwan's representative in Washington, D.C., has reportedly told
relevant government authorities about the U.S. concern over the high frequency
and high level of interaction between retired Taiwanese generals and Chinese
military authorities in recent years.</P>
      <P>The United States has maintained close military cooperation with Taiwan for
decades. It has typically briefed Taiwan on the itinerary and main purposes
before its senior military officers depart for visits to China. The U.S.
government has reportedly asked Taiwan to follow suit by giving briefings on
retired generals' visits to and interaction with China.</P>
      <P>Sources familiar with the affair said former National Security Council
Secretary-General Su Chi had reminded the Ministry of National Defense on many
occasions of the U.S. concern. As Taiwan's law does not impose any restrictions
on such visits, the ministry can only collect information about retired
generals' China travel plans and report it to superior authorities.</P>
      <P>When Hsu Li-nung, a former chief of the General Political Warfare Department
under the ministry, led a group of retired senior generals to Beijing for a
high-profile visit in April, he said one of the event's primary purposes was to
promote the establishment of a military confidence-building mechanism.</P>
      <P>His remarks drew much concern from U.S. authorities. Even scholars at the
Washington-based think tank Center for Strategic and International Studies had
repeatedly inquired during their Taipei visits about the possibility of Taiwan
and China forging a military mechanism without U.S. participation.</P>
      <P>Ministry officials have assured U.S. think tank researchers that cross-strait
dialogue and engagements will continue to focus on economic issues and will not
expand to political and security subjects in the near future.</P>
      <P>Major alumni clubs formed by retired generals  have often expressed hopes to
receive government authorization to develop ties with Chinese military
authorities.  The Ma administration  has adamantly rejected such requests,
however, and declined to give any financial aid for their China visits as it
believes that the time is not yet ripe for Taiwan to forge a political or
military mechanism with China, security sources have said. (Aug. 30, 2010).</P>

    <HEADLINE>The Liberty Times: Challenges lurk in growth figures</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>08/30/10  12:35:14
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Despite brilliant growth figures reported over the past two months,  Taiwan's
economic  outlook is probably no longer so optimistic. However, President Ma
Ying-jeou's administration has apparently not become aware of the potential
challenges that Taiwan is facing.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's economy heated up in July as the job market gained some momentum, but
leading economic indicators for the month dipped, marking the eighth consecutive
monthly decline.</P>
      <P>Economic growth is expected to slow in the second half of the year as a result
of declines in the leading economic indicators in China, the United States and
Europe -- the major markets of heavily export-reliant Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The HSBC Chinese Purchasing Managers' Index dropped to a new low of 49.4 percent
in July, indicating that China's manufacturing sector -- the prime mover behind
that nation's economic growth -- has sagged. As the U.S. unemployment rate has
persisted at around 10 percent, Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman has
said the American economy will not recover for a long time, while the EU
economies remain stuck in a debt quagmire.</P>
      <P>Ignorant and inattentive, how will the Ma administration be able to lead the
Taiwanese people across the bridge over troubled waters? It might manage to
cover its inefficiency when the winds are blowing favorably, but once global
adversities set in again, Taiwan is not going to be spared. (Editorial abstract

      <P>A tough loss to Japan on Saturday didn't keep Taiwan's Fu-Hsing Little League
team from battering Texas 14-2 in the consolation game Sunday.</P>
      <P>The team from Kaohsiung came out swinging and stunned Texas with nine quick runs
in the top of the first inning to create a deficit from which the Texans never
recovered.</P>
      <P>At a press conference after the game was ended on the mercy rule, reporters
asked Fu-Hsing's players why their performance seemed so much better than in the
previous day's 3-2 loss to Japan. Several of the players reportedly answered
straightforwardly: Japan is much stronger than Texas.</P>
      <P>Shih Shun-hao started the game with a three-run homer. Then after the big first
inning, Taiwan went on to score a run in the second and three more in the third.</P>
      <P>Texas managed to tally two points in the bottom of the third, but Taiwan added
another nail in the coffin in the top of the fourth and held off Texas in the
second half of the inning for the mercy-rule win.</P>

have made, but today we avoided a lot of mistakes we could have made," Shih

    <TEXT>
      <P>A Taiwanese agricultural mission stationed in Haiti is experimenting with a new
rice variety in an effort to help the Caribbean nation increase its rice
production.</P>
      <P>The French-language Le Nouvelliste, Haiti's largest newspaper, gave heavy
coverage of the Taiwanese mission's drive on its economic pages Aug. 14-15.</P>
      <P>According to the report, the new rice strain Prosequisa-4, also known as P-4, is
bringing new hope to the country's goal of increasing its annual rice crop.</P>
      <P>The new variety has been planted in L'Artibonite valley plain, Haiti's most
important rice production area, which used to contribute most of the country's
annual output.</P>
      <P>However, production declined substantially after the region was hit by an
outbreak of crop disease in 1998, the report said.</P>
      <P>The Taiwanese agricultural mission then collaborated with the Haitian government
to introduce the Taiwan-developed Taichung Shan No. 10 variety on the plain,
which thrived there.</P>
      <P>The report quoted Hsiang Shui-sung, head of the Taiwanese agricultural  mission
there,  as saying that the average rice productivity in L'Artibonite plain is no
more than 2.5 tons per hectare.</P>
      <P>With the introduction of P-4, however, production is expected to reach 4-6 tons
per hectare, Hsiang said, adding that if the strain is planted in a "three
harvests per year" model, production costs will be slashed while annual output
will increase.</P>
      <P>Haiti consumes about 500,000 tons of rice annually, with 70 percent imported
from abroad. With 60,000 hectares of rice paddies, Haiti produces only about
150,000 tons of rice a year.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Flat panel maker AU Optronics Corp. (AUO) said Sunday that the company hopes
disputes concerning the Central Taiwan Science Park will be resolved through a
land swap.</P>
      <P>AUO Chairman K.Y. Lee said the National Science Council (NSC) is planning to
adjust its plan for the development of the fourth phase of the science park by
proposing a land swap with the farmers who had their land taken from them by the
government.</P>
      <P>Lee said he hopes the proposed land swap will resolve the environmental
protection disputes in the development of the fourth phase of the science park
in Erlin, Changhua County, where AUO plans to build two 11th-generation flat
panel plants and solar energy facilities.</P>
      <P>The government has expropriated the land for the development, but the farmers
there oppose the expropriation and have refused to accept the offered
compensation, saying that they want to keep their land and continue farming it.</P>
      <P>In July, the Taiwan High Administrative Court ordered the suspension of the
development of the third and fourth phases of the science park after residents
sued the government for failing to present  a reliable  environmental  impact
assessment  for the development.</P>
      <P>The government has appealed the court decision.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the investors who already operate facilities in the third phase of
the development have been allowed by the government to continue their operations
despite the court order.</P>
      <P>AUO has completed the construction of an 8.5th-generation plant in the third
phase of the development, located in Taichung County's Houli, and is scheduled
to install production equipment by the end of this year.</P>
      <P>Lee said the new plant will become operational next year with an initial monthly
production capacity of 45,000 units.</P>
      <P>The company also plans to build another 8.5th-generation plant in Houli.</P>
      <P>In another development, Lee described a U.S. court order barring three AUO
present and former executives from leaving the U.S. is inhumane as two of the
three are now unable to care for their sick parents in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The three were ordered not to travel outside the U.S. Aug. 19 after they
appeared in court in San Francisco to plead a case in which prosecutors accused
AUO and the executives of participating in a price-fixing conspiracy with other
Asian LCD makers between 2001 and 2006.</P>
      <P>He said that although his company has assigned other executives to shoulder
their workloads, the company's operations will be affected in the long run.</P>
      <P>AUO has repeatedly denied the price fixing accusations and has vowed to fight
the charges brought by the U.S. Department of Justice in June.</P>

      <P>The government will introduce simplified procedures for visa issuance for Hong
Kong citizens in the near future, Mainland Affairs Council Chairwoman Lai Shin-
yuan said Monday.</P>
      <P>During a meeting in Taipei to promote economic and cultural cooperation between
Taiwan and Hong Kong, Lai said that over the past century, civilian exchanges
between Taiwan and Hong Kong have been active, even more so since the beginning
of the 21st century, which she said has helped lay the foundation for economic
and trade relations between the two sides.</P>
      <P>In the aspect of economy and trade, Hong Kong is Taiwan's fourth-largest trade
partner, and two-way trade and the number of travelers between the two sides are
expected to reach US$38.8 billion and 3 million, respectively, Lai said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the number of China-based Taiwanese businesses listed on the Hong
Kong Stock Exchange has reached 60, and some leading Taiwanese companies now
consider Hong Kong as the main place for raising business capital, Lai added.</P>
      <P>She noted that with the aim of promoting civilian exchanges between the two
sides, the government last year relaxed employment restrictions on Hong Kong
students, allowing them to enroll in graduate programs after graduating from
local universities, and also began extending the duration of stay on visas for
Hong Kong-based Chinese citizens visiting Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The government is also seeking to further streamline visa application procedures
for Hong Kong citizens, Lai added.</P>
      <P>Despite the booming exchanges between Taiwan and Hong Kong, there are still some
key details related to the exercise of public power to be addressed between the
two sides, Lai went on.</P>
      <P>The meeting was the first of its kind between the Taiwan-Hong Kong Economic and
Cultural Co-operation Council (ECCC) and its Hong Kong counterpart,  the Hong
Kong-Taiwan  Economic and Cultural Co-operation and Promotion Council (ECCPC) ,
since they were set up earlier this year to improve and strengthen relations
between the two sides.</P>
      <P>Lai said she hopes the two sides will engage in talks on topics of mutual
concern and enhance economic and trade exchanges and interaction through the
forum.</P>
      <P>Also present at the meeting were Hong Kong Financial Secretary John Tsang, ECCC
Chairman Lin Chen-kuo and ECCPC Chairman Lee Yeh-kwong.</P>

      <P>He also said the recently signed economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA)

prosperity for the two sides.</P>
      <P>"Under the new circumstances, Taiwan and St. Vincent and the Grenadines are

      <P>Taiwan share prices closed up 0.23 percent Monday after profit taking emerged to
erode the earlier gains which were posted in reflection of a Wall Street rebound
at the end of last week, dealers said.</P>
      <P>The weighted index rose 18.29 points to 7,741.20, after moving between 7,737.28
and 7,806.91, on turnover of NT$87.90 billion (US$2.74 billion).</P>
      <P>The market opened up 0.96 percent on the latest Wall Street upside after a
downward revision of the U.S. economic growth in the second quarter was less
than expected, but fears of a major pullback ahead of the strong resistance at
the 7,900-8,000 point range prompted investors to lock in profit and capped the
gains, dealers said.</P>
      <P>A total of 1,673 stocks closed up and 1,871 down with 297 stocks remaining
unchanged.</P>
      <P>The foodstuff sector scored the highest gains, up 2.1 percent. Financials gained
0.8 percent, textile, construction, and plastics and chemical stocks rose 0.2
percent, and cement stocks added 0.1 percent.</P>
      <P>The machinery and electronics sector fell 0.1 percent and the paper and pulp
sector lost 0.2 percent.</P>
      <P>"Investors remained cautious about the market outlook amid lingering fears of a
slowing global economy in the second half of this year," MasterLink Securities
analyst Tom Tang said.</P>
      <P>Tang said although the second quarter U.S. economic growth revision was better
than expected, other economic data, in particular home sales figures, still
disappointed investors.</P>
      <P>"Wall Street is very likely to remain choppy on economic uncertainty," Tang
said, "Friday's rebound in U.S. markets has failed to comfort investors as they
are afraid that volatility will follow."</P>
      <P>Tang said rotational buying has served as a driver behind the recent gains, but
since the buying rotated so quickly that the market has been in short of a
mainstream sector to help the broader market to make a breakthrough.</P>
      <P>He said the buying focused on traditional industrial stocks, instead of the
bellwether electronics sector, on concerns over global demand for high tech
products.</P>
      <P>"Investors had better keep cutting holdings once the market stages a rebound,"
Tang said.</P>
      <P>In among  non high tech stocks,  Food firm  Uni-President Enterprises gained
4.35 percent to NT$37.15, Prince Housing added 2.19 percent to NT$0.40 and Chang
Hwa Bank rose 2.78 percent to NT$18.50.</P>
      <P>The electronics sector was affected by Intel's downgrade of its sales forecast
for the third quarter with memory chip maker Nanya Technology down 3.77 percent
at NT$19.75 and United Microelectronics Corp. unchanged at NT$13.05.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ECFA will help bring investors to Taiwan: vice premier</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  Aug.  30 (CNA)
08/30/10  15:19:44
(By Wang Shu-feng and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan is poised to pull out of its economic isolation and regain its global
competitiveness now that it has clinched an economic cooperation framework
agreement (ECFA) with China, Vice Premier Sean Chen said Monday.</P>
      <P>In the wake of the ECFA signing in late June, tension across the Taiwan Strait
has dropped further, which will help Taiwan entice investors, funds and advanced
technologies from around the world, Chen said during an "invest in Taiwan"
workshop in the southern port city of Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>He said that in the past, Taiwan's exports to China always surpassed exports by
member states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).</P>
      <P>However, ASEAN has overtaken Taiwan since 2005 in export volume to China, while
Taiwan's overall competitiveness has also slid, he noted.</P>
      <P>He attributed the jump of ASEAN exports to China mainly to the ASEAN Plus China
free trade accord, under which ASEAN members enjoy tariff concessions on their
shipments to China. The accord took effect Jan. 1 this year but ASEAN countries
actually began benefiting from the process of drawing up the agreement several
years ago.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan has tried not to be left too far behind, which was the reason for its
efforts to forge the ECFA with China, " the vice premier said.</P>
      <P>He added that many businesses can "smell" the business potential in post-ECFA
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Taking the domestic hospitality industry as an example, he said, fresh
investment worth some NT$47 billion (US$1.47 billion) is expected to be
channeled into the industry by 2012, representing an increase of 5,800 hotel
rooms.</P>
      <P>Chen said the country's rich resources of high-caliber workers and the strong
ambition demonstrated by Taiwanese businessmen are two of Taiwan's major assets
that will act as a magnet for attracting foreign investors.</P>
      <P>Council of Economic Planning and Development Chairwoman Christina Liu, who also
spoke at the workshop, said the event was aimed at "igniting the domestic
consumption engine" to rev up investment at home, which will in turn power the
country's overall economic growth.</P>
      <P>The ECFA, ratified by the legislature Aug. 17, is expected to take effect in
September.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Officials to visit Dubai to seek development tips</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  30 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>A Taiwanese delegation is scheduled to visit Dubai Sept. 19 with the aim of
learning from the fast-growing free trade port about how to attract
international investment, Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC)
officials said Monday.</P>
      <P>As Dubai successfully launched a "logistics city" program in 2007, the Taiwanese
delegation, led by Chi Wen-chung, director of the Department of Navigation and
Aviation, is hopeful of learning from Dubai's experience in developing logistics
services, they said.</P>
      <P>According to the MOTC, the port of Dubai has attracted up to 5,000 companies
over the past 25 years, compared to Taiwan's four free trade ports, which
between them have attracted just 102 firms -- none of which are internationally
famous -- since the establishment of free trade ports in 2003.</P>
      <P>Dubai, where the container cargo-handling amount is ranked No. 7 in the world,
has grown very fast over the past 10 years -- with GDP reaching 230 percent
growth in the period.</P>
      <P>As crude oil only contributes about 6 percent of Dubai's GDP, the country has
been aggressively promoting its tourism, logistics industries and free trade
port, officials said.</P>
      <P>Dubai's operating model is quite simple -- it levies a 5-percent tax on all
companies investing in the port, the MOTC officials said, adding that the model
has proved effective because as the port has attracted investment from most of
the major international companies, they said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Awakening News fights on with unique vision</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>08/30/10  16:39:49</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>If you are not convinced that good things come in small packages, try visiting
the Awakening News Network website. The so-called "multivitamin of news"
promises to provide you with all the news you need to know that day in less than
30 articles.</P>
      <P>With only 12 staff members, the network is more than just a paper, despite its
Chinese name -- "Taiwan Awakening Newspaper." Awakening transmits its news
stories through radio broadcasts, television, the Internet, mobile phones, and
of course, in print.</P>
      <P>It is touted to be Taiwan's first mass media outlet that makes use of the full
range of communication formats to convey its information to the public.</P>
      <P>It seemed to be a bit off base for Catherine Y. L. Lin to found Awakening on
Sept. 1, 2008 when newspapers around the world were falling victims to the
rising popularity of the Internet and the island was in the grips of a financial
crisis which took a heavy financial toll on the local mass media.</P>
      <P>But as a veteran journalist who had served at the United Daily News and
CommonWealth monthly, Lin was disappointed with the island's mass media, which
bristles with papers and TV stations that are sympathetic to specific political
parties and seem to try to brainwash their readers or audience with politically
biased reports.</P>
      <P>They also indulge in exposing groundless scandals,  airing sensationalist
stories, and go to great lengths to feed their readers and audience celebrity
gossip.</P>
      <P>Fair reporting and impartial political commentary are rare if not absent.</P>
      <P>Former Academia Sinica President Lee Yuan-tseh once cited a foreigner friend as
complaining that his personal experience with local people told him that Taiwan
was a lovable country, but that when he turned on the TV he found an ugliness
contrary to what he knew.</P>
      <P>In order to avoid this kind of unhealthy news, Awakening is devoted to providing
stories that makes readers feel warm and encouraged.</P>
      <P>The reports aim to carry the opinions of experts rather than well-known TV talk
show figures and to discuss issues of public concern rather than stories about
celebrities cheating on their spouses.</P>
      <P>People who visit the Awakening News Network website will find that the stories
posted are comprehensive yet condensed -- an epitome of Lin's belief that "less
is more."</P>
      <P>"Our principle is 'write in brief, report in depth.' Living in a world
overwhelmed with information, modern people don't need to read more than 20 to
30 news items a day," Lin said.</P>
      <P>As a university lecturer of journalism for more than 20 years, she knows a
concise, all-inclusive story is worth more than a page of disorganized reports.</P>
      <P>In her opinion, a good story should not exceed 500 to 600 words, but it should
include the facts, their significance, perspective, impact, possible future
developments and solutions.</P>
      <P>If the story is about a person, the report should cover the opinions of people
surrounding him or her, such as rivals and other people concerned.</P>
      <P>By the same token, Lin said a story about the ruling Kuomintang must cover
reactions from the opposition Democratic Progressive Party and the Taiwan
Solidarity Union, and vice versa.</P>
      <P>"Just like taking a picture, you need to shed light on the subject from
different angles to highlight its true image," she said.</P>
      <P>She posts minutes from daily meetings of the network's correspondents on the
website, including senior editors' advice to rookie reporters about how to cover
an event, even though some of the suggestions aren't always reflected in the
final story.</P>
      <P>"We want our readers and audience to know what we thought about," Lin said.</P>
      <P>Visitors to the site can also find a section showing reporters reviewing their
work that day, or their feelings during the coverage of news events, which gives
a close-up of the scene, the people and the event being reported.</P>
      <P>Lin often reminds the network's reporters to send out their stories ahead of
their counterparts at the Central News Agency, Taiwan's state news agency, and
tells them the stories should be more comprehensive than those from CNA. If CNA
reporters interview one person, she said, Awakening's reporters should interview
five.</P>
      <P>In addition to writing, the reporters at the network also shoot news films,
create and edit broadcast tapes, and serve as anchors to transmit their stories
via radio, television, mobile phones and the Internet.</P>
      <P>"I really feel sorry for my reporters, because I give them one person's salary
but ask them to do the work of four people, and ask them to double in brass all
the while," Lin said.</P>
      <P>The reason is the network's tight budget, which comes entirely from Lin's
personal savings. She even sold her house to raise the start-up funds.</P>
      <P>Noting that Google, the world's largest web portal, made no profit in the first
five years after its launch, Lin said she didn't expect her network to bring any
profit soon, nor did she care.</P>
      <P>"What I'm concerned about most is whether the network can exercise an
influence," she said.</P>
      <P>But she was confident the network can cater to the demand of many people who
would rather cut to the chase and learn the real news.</P>
      <P>This was borne out in May when Awakening became one of two local papers to
provide news to Apple computer company's iPhone users, thousands of iPhone users
downloaded the software needed to read Awakening in just a few days after its
release, delighting Lin and her staff.</P>
      <P>On Aug. 1, the network launched a weekly in print which was the last step toward
Lin's dream of a multi-media network.</P>
      <P>In the last two years, 10 web portals have subscribed to its news service and it
is looking forward to selling its news to more cable TV channels, as only eight
of the nearly 100 channels currently provide news reports.</P>
      <P>Although the network's prospects look brighter now than they did two years ago,
Lin is not certain how long it will survive, but she said it would be better to
have fought and lost than never to have fought at all. By Maubo Chang CNA staff

    <TEXT>
      <P>Shares of solar cell maker E-Ton Solar Tech Co. fell sharply Monday after the
company reported a massive net loss for the first half of this year, dealers
said.</P>
      <P>The over-the-counter market listed E-Ton as falling 6.94 percent to NT$45.60
(US$1.42 billion) with 772,000 shares changing hands, while the OTC index closed
down 0.83 percent at 137.84 points.</P>
      <P>E-Ton posted NT$3.01 billion in net losses in the first half of this year after
a NT$2.34 billion net loss recorded in 2009.</P>
      <P>"The company has incurred net losses for the sixth consecutive quarter, largely
reflecting its unprofitable subsidiary in the United States, GIH," TLG Asset
Management analyst Arch Shih told the Central News Agency Monday.</P>
      <P>E-Ton acquired U.S.-based ADEMA Technologies in 2007 and combined the newly
acquired business with one of its units -- Gloria Solar Ltd. -- to form Gloria
Solar International Holding, Inc. (GIH), which is engaged in the production of
upstream solar products, including monocrystalline ingots and photovoltaic
modules.</P>
      <P>Shih said E-Ton had previously wanted to extend its foothold to solar cell
material production as part of its strategy for vertical business integration
through the acquisition of ADEMA.</P>
      <P>"ADEMA had a lot of unprofitable intangible assets, however, and E-Ton has had
to incorporate the losses, "Shih said.</P>
      <P>"A global financial crisis in 2008 made the situation even worse. E-Ton needed
more provisions to cover the losses. That's why the market was stunned by its
massive losses reported for the first half," Shih said.</P>
      <P>MasterLink Securities analyst Tom Tang said it was not easy for E-Ton, which was
smaller than ADEMA in terms of capitalization, to run the acquired assets.</P>
      <P>"It was like a funny scenario with a small child driving a big car," Tang said.</P>
      <P>In the first half of this year, E-Ton's gross margin stood at only 6.48 percent,
much lower than the average of about 14 percent in the solar cell industry.</P>
      <P>Among E-Ton's rivals, Motech Industries reported a gross margin of 16.69 percent
and Solartech Energy registered 17.44 percent for its gross margin.</P>
      <P>"The weak gross margin reflected E-Ton's low production capacity utilization on
falling orders after a major management reshuffle last year had an impact on the
company's operations, " TLG's Shih said.</P>
      <P>The reshuffle came after several senior executives resigned in a disagreement
over E-Ton's management of the U.S. subsidiary, Shih said.</P>
      <P>"The stock is very likely to fall further amid uncertainty over its outlook,"
Shih said. "Keep a distance from it, please."</P>

      <P>One day after Taiwan wrapped up its first national educational conference in 16
years, scholars who were at the two-day event concluded Monday that the
conference lacked focus.</P>
      <P>Asked to comment on the conference touted by the Taiwanese authorities as an
important event in the education field, Tuan Chyau, a visiting professor at the
Chinese University of Hong Kong, said at a press conference that "there were too
many different themes to see a focus."</P>
      <P>He expressed hope that a planned education white paper scheduled to be published
before the end of the year will not be merely a record of the diverse opinions
from the conference.</P>
      <P>Echoing Tuan, Wu Wu-tien, an honorary professor at National Taiwan Normal
University, expressed regret that the conference lost its focus.</P>
      <P>Individual  events that occurred at the same time as the conference took away
media attention, while discussions were broken down into many various themes
ranging from cross-Taiwan Strait educational exchanges to lifelong learning, Wu
said.</P>
      <P>One of the events Wu referred to was the case of a teenage gunman who turned
himself in for the high-profile murder of alleged Taichung gangster Weng Chi-nan
in late May and blamed his involvement in crime on poor education.</P>
      <P>At the news conference, the scholars, who also included Chou Chu-ying, a
professor at National Chengchi University's College of Education,  talked about
the surrender of Liao Kuo-hao --  a 17-year-old high school drop-out -- after 90
days as one of the country's most-wanted fugitives.</P>
      <P>Urging the government  to pay more attention  to academic under-achievers, Chou
said that so long as there is even one Liao Kuo-hao in society, no effort should
be spared in educational reform.</P>
      <P>The Eighth National Education Conference, which opened Saturday at the National
Central Library, gathered officials, teachers and representatives of civic
groups from across Taiwan with the aim of formulating "an education policy that
will pave the way for Taiwan's `golden decade, '" according to Minister of
Education Wu Ching-ji.</P>
      <P>The conference had 10 central themes, including the education system in general,
higher education, special education, faculty training, internationalized

    <TEXT>
      <P>Free passes to a unique series of concerts on a stage floating down a tunnel
waterway in the Cold War battleground of Kinmen will become available on Sept.
1, organizers said Monday.</P>
      <P>"All the concerts will be free of charge, but as each one can only accommodate
300 people, those interested in attending should register as soon as possible, "
said Tseng Wei-hung, director of the Kinmen National Park Administration.</P>
      <P>Registration can be made online or by fax or phone, Tseng said.</P>
      <P>The concert series, this year featuring six concerts of 40 minutes each on Oct.
16-17, will be the second of its kind presented in the 101-meter-long Zhaishan
Tunnel, a war era relic that is now a tourist attraction.</P>
      <P>Five prominent local musicians presented two "watery concerts" in the tunnel
last October for the first time to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the
Battle of Kuningtou, in which an outmanned Nationalist force repelled an
invasion by the Chinese communists.</P>
      <P>"As the unprecedented waterway concerts drew an enthusiastic response, we
decided to host a music festival at the same venue this year, " Tseng said.</P>
      <P>Those who successfully register for standing room passes will witness the
special concerts from a walkway in the tunnel surrounding the A-shaped waterway.</P>
      <P>Six musicians  --  cellist Chang Cheng-chieh,  flutist  Wu Tsung-hsien, harpist
Hung Chi-mei, violinists Liang Chien-wen and Wu Ting-yu, and violist Lee Ching-
yi -- will perform in the concerts, with Chang serving as artistic director,
Tseng said.</P>
      <P>The Oct. 16 concerts will feature string quartet pieces and the Oct. 17 concerts
will have recitals for the violin, harp, flute and cello, according to Tseng.</P>
      <P>Chang, the driving artistic force behind last year's concerts, said after the
performances that he was amazed by the acoustics at the venue, describing them
as "much, much better" than he had expected.</P>
      <P>"I have only one word to describe my first-ever concert in the waterway --
terrific," he said emotionally.</P>
      <P>Located  in the southwestern  part of Kinmen Island,  the underground Zhaishan
Tunnel -- 101 meters long, 6 meters wide and 3.5 meters high -- opens into the
Taiwan Strait. Its A-shaped waterway has a pier that can dock up to 42 small
boats.</P>
      <P>Construction on the tunnel got underway in 1961 and took five years to complete.
It served as a small boat base for shipments of military supplies on the island,
which was the front line of hostilities between Taiwan and China during the Cold
War.</P>
      <P>With the improvement of cross-strait relations, the number of Taiwanese troops
stationed in Kinmen has been reduced, and the island is being gradually
transformed into a tourist destination, with war sites as the main attraction.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Control Yuan member applies for probe into overpricing</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Control Yuan member Yeh Yao-peng said Monday that he will apply to conduct an
investigation into the overpricing of flowers used in Taipei City's Xinsheng
Overpass reconstruction project and would not rule out the possibility of
questioning Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin.</P>
      <P>Yeh made the remarks after the city government came under fire for paying up to
30 times the market price for flowers to decorate Xinsheng Overpass and the
Taipei International Flora Exposition and as much as 12 times the market price
for other project materials.</P>
      <P>Yeh said that because of numerous flaws found in the tender process for the
project, it is necessary to look into the case.</P>
      <P>His investigation will focus on whether the city government and other government
agencies accepted kickbacks or neglected their supervisory duty, he said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taipei City councilor candidate Juan Chao-hsiung of the opposition
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) visited the Control Yuan Monday, petitioning
it to open an investigation into the overpricing.</P>
      <P>Juan said that a task force headed by Hau that the city government formed
couldn't be impartial and that it was inappropriate for the mayor to be "both
player and referee."</P>
      <P>On the other hand, DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen said that the party will not take
advantage of the alleged scandal, which reportedly could hurt Hau's chances for
re-election.</P>
      <P>Hau said Sunday that the allegations of overpricing amounted to a "crisis" for
him.</P>
      <P>The Chinese-language Apple Daily reported Sunday that Hau, who had enjoyed a
narrow lead over DPP rival Su Tseng-chang in the polls since Su declared his
candidacy for the Nov. 27 mayoral election in March, lagged 1.56 percent behind
Su in the paper's latest survey.</P>
      <P>Su urged the city government to face the issue honestly and not take into
account any political or electoral considerations when dealing with the problem.</P>
      <P>In related news,  Lin Chun-hung,  who was among about 20 representatives from
the floral, gardening and landscaping industry invited by the city government to
an event Monday to show support for the Taipei Flora Expo, said during the
event, "We don't support Hau."</P>
      <P>According to Lin, some flower farmers who have worked for the expo for about six
months have not yet received their pay.</P>
      <P>Hau said at the event that the expo would be the pride of Taiwan and that the
floral fair would provide a good opportunity for local flower farmers because
more than 90 percent of flowers -- worth a total of NT$2.1 billion -- would be
locally grown.</P>
      <P>In response to allegations of overpricing, Hau said he would take his share of
responsibility for the case and promised to look into the matter. He added that
he would leave the decision as to whether he should assume political
responsibility to voters.</P>
      <P>He appealed to the public for help, however, saying that "you can choose not to
support Hau Lung-bin, but you have to support the expo."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Chinese online game players are "flocking" to Taiwan using a variety of methods
to evade their government's tight control over the Internet. The result is that
the interaction between young people on the two sides of the Taiwan Strait is no
less commonplace than cross-Strait trade and tourism exchanges in the real
world.</P>
      <P>Despite  unavoidable  misunderstandings  due  to  cultural differences, the
online exchanges offer Chinese web users what they consider Taiwan's most
valuable contribution to the Chinese speaking world and what many Taiwanese take
for granted: freedom.</P>
      <P>The Chinese government's recent move to tighten censorship of online games, in
combination with an existing regulation limiting the time players spend on games
to prevent addiction, has given users extra incentive to break through the iron
curtain that has descended on cyberspace in China.</P>
      <P>Many popular online games designed around the world have been unable to gain
approval for release in China, including new versions of existing games such as
"World of Warcraft."</P>
      <P>To play the new games, Chinese gamers instead starting using the games'
Taiwanese servers, which are generally more updated than any others around the
world and use a language Chinese users can easily understand.</P>
      <P>That, however, has led Taiwanese game companies to build walls against Chinese
users, because their numbers tend to overload Taiwanese servers and their
intrusion has led to disputes over theft of user accounts.</P>
      <P>With Taiwanese companies blocking Chinese games, another business opportunity
arose -- setting up overseas proxy servers.</P>
      <P>Even though the monthly fee is double the price Taiwanese gamers pay to play
games, Chinese gamers are making connections to Taiwan through proxy servers so
that Taiwanese companies cannot screen them by their IP address.</P>
      <P>Chinese web users have not been stopped by multiple barriers from breaking
through to the sites they like, but those barriers have made the users more
appreciative of the freedoms they lack -- just one of the outcomes of closer
ties between Taiwan and China, whether online or not.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan offers 'Hope' to Haitian quake survivors</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>08/30/10  19:22:31</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Seven months after Haiti was struck by a killer earthquake, more than 1.5
million displaced survivors in Port-au-Prince are still scrounging to find a
permanent place to call home.</P>
      <P>The city is still dotted with makeshift tents made from tattered tarpaulin.
Heaps of debris and rusting exposed wires can be seen everywhere -- glaring
indicators of the country's snailed-pace recovery.</P>
      <P>But while the situation remains dismal for most survivors, 200 families are
optimistic that they will soon go from being homeless to homeowners.</P>
      <P>These 200 families were handpicked by the Haitian government as the first
residents of Hope Village -- a rural resettlement community that Taiwan has
volunteered to build from scratch.</P>
      <P>The village will be spread out over 330 hectares in the mountainous central
region of Savanne Diane and each family will be given a 40-square meter house
and small plot of farm land. There will also be a school, a church, and a public
square for social gatherings.</P>
      <P>The project is a realization of one of the four pledges made by President Ma
Ying-jeou two weeks after the quake to help with Haiti's reconstruction.</P>
      <P>Lisa Hsu, deputy-director of the Department of the Disaster Relief of the Red
Cross Society of the Republic of China, said the project is aimed at giving
those who escaped Port-au-Prince during the earthquake a new lease of life.</P>
      <P>"The Haitian government and many international non-government organizations have
listed resettlement of survivors, especially those who have left Port-au-Prince,
as top priority in an effort to alleviate the pressure of over-population in the
city," she said.</P>
      <P>The site of the village project is about a five-hour drive from the capital and
the roads leading to it are extremely rugged. But the Haitian government
purposely chose this part of the country for development in the hope that other
countries and NGOs will follow Taiwan's lead, Hsu said.</P>
      <P>This is a collaborative effort between the Taiwan government, which has pledged
US$1 million, and the Red Cross Society, which will contribute the remaining
US$2.2 million, she said.</P>
      <P>The houses are being built with consideration for the local culture, Hsu said.</P>
      <P>"We wanted to be sensitive to the Haitian style of living, so after conducting a
field survey, we decided to build detached kitchens and outhouse bathrooms with
sit-down toilets because that is what the people are used to," Hsu said.</P>
      <P>However,  the project will extend beyond housing and land ownership,  said Yen
Ming-hong, a project manager at Taiwan's International Cooperation Development
Fund (ICDF).</P>
      <P>Yen said the ICDF has agreed to offer long-term technical support to the village
residents by sending an agricultural technical mission to train them in areas
such as growing maize and raising chickens.</P>
      <P>"We want to give the villagers a sustainable environment in which they can
become self-reliant in the long-run," Yen said.</P>
      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) will also send Taiwanese medical professionals to
staff the community clinic, he added.</P>
      <P>ICDF agricultural specialist Huang Kun-chung, who worked in Taiwan's overseas
technical missions for 40 years, has been called out of retirement to head the
farming project.</P>
      <P>Since mid-May, Huang and some of the people who will live in Hope Village have
been tilling a 40-hectare field in the blazing heat to experiment with the type
of maize that would grow best there.</P>
      <P>Huang said the agricultural mission has decided on two local varieties of maize
and the rest of the field will be planted next week.</P>
      <P>In addition to maize, Huang said, the team will also designate some land for
sorghum and Congo beans, two popular staples among Haitians, to ensure that the
villagers will have a food harvest all year round.</P>
      <P>The community  is expected  to house 1,000 people in 200 households, and space
has been reserved for possible expansion in the future, Hsu said.</P>
      <P>A date has not yet been set for the groundbreaking but the plan for the layout
of the village is expected to be finalized before the end of the year, he said.

      <P>Canadian TV host Bob Blumer broke the Guinness World Record for eating 134
grains of rice in three minutes in Taipei on Monday, the seventh world record he
has set in various food-related challenges.</P>
      <P>Blumer, host of the Food Network's "Glutton for Punishment," set the new world
record on the final day of the 2010 Taipei Culinary Exhibition.</P>
      <P>His three tries at eating individual grains of rice with chopsticks all
surpassed the previous world record -- 78 grains of rice in three minutes -- set
nearly two years ago.</P>
      <P>"I am still hungry! " said an excited Blumer after successfully eating 134
grains of rice during his second attempt.</P>
      <P>Blumer picked up 125 grains, 134 grains, and 131 grains on his three attempts,
respectively.</P>
      <P>The previous record was set by Rob Beaton in November 2008 in the U.S., who
picked up 23 grains of rice in one minute, and 78 grains of rice in three
minutes.</P>
      <P>Blumer is usually given five days to become proficient enough in an episode's
featured specialty. After he arrived in Taiwan on Aug. 26, he quickly learned
how to use chopsticks under a local chef's training.</P>
      <P>"No one was able to beat me, " Blumer said after winning several challenges
against local residents.</P>
      <P>Among other Guinness World Records broken by the TV host include making 168
pizzas in 60 minutes in Canada in July 2010, flipping 559 pancakes in one hour,

    <TEXT>
      <P>Ever since the country's trade pact with China was signed June 29, local banks
eager to venture into the Chinese market have set their sights on five areas
densely populated by Taiwanese businessmen, officials from Hua Nan Financial
Holdings said Monday.</P>
      <P>The Yangtze River Delta in southern Jiangsu Province and northern Zhejiang
Province and the Pearl River Delta in southern Guangdong Province where the
largest numbers of Taiwanese businessmen in China are located, are the top
priority of local banks, the officials said.</P>
      <P>However, if they go there all together, the competition among them is expected
to be fierce, they said.</P>
      <P>The other three areas are Chengdu and Chongqing in western China, Bohai Bay in
northern China's Hebei Province, and the Western Taiwan Strait Economic Zone in
Fujian Province.</P>
      <P>Chengdu and Chongqing, along with Bohai Bay, are attractive to local banks
because China's authorities offer fast-track services in approving Taiwan banks
operating there and also waive restrictions on the number of branch offices they
can open, in attempts to boost economic development in those areas.</P>
      <P>Among the local banks, Hua Nan Bank,  First Bank, Taiwan Cooperative Bank, Chang
Hwa Bank, Cathay United Bank and Land Bank of Taiwan have been approved  by
Taiwan's  Financial  Supervisory Commission to upgrade their representative
offices in China to branches.</P>
      <P>For those banks, their top priority is to make profits after the inauguration of
their branches in China, as under Chinese rules, they will only be allowed to
extend loans in Chinese yuan to Taiwanese businessmen one year after they begin
to make profits.</P>
      <P>Hua Nan Bank estimates that its Chinese branches will break even six months to
one year after inauguration and it forecast that it will be able to lend out
US$56 million in the first year, similar to a First Bank forecast of US$50
million to US$100 million.</P>
      <P>However, since Taiwanese banks will not be allowed to receive savings in yuan,
their ability to extend loans in yuan will be limited unless they can cooperate
with Chinese banks.</P>
      <P>Local bankers said Taiwanese banks used to be more cautious than their Chinese
counterparts in extending loans and are more familiar with Taiwanese business
operating in China, while Chinese banks have ample supplies of yuan, so that
cooperation between them will benefit both sides.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan Stock Exchange (TWSE) said Monday it is studying the feasibility of a
mechanism that would immediately suspend trading of a Hong Kong-listed company's
Taiwan depositary receipts (TDRs) if trading in that company's shares is halted
in Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>The plan emerged after TDRs issued by Hong Kong-listed Kith Holdings Ltd.
continued to be traded for two days in Taiwan after the Hong Kong Exchange
suspended trading of Kith's shares.</P>
      <P>Kith, a China-based multi-color paper packaging product maker, listed its TDRs
in February after being listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in 1998.</P>
      <P>Trading of Kith shares on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange was suspended on Aug. 18
at 10: 10 a.m., pending a sensitive information announcement, but the company
did not disclose the trading suspension information on the TWSE until 1:28 p.m.
on the same day.</P>
      <P>Even more problematic, its TDRs continued to trade in Taiwan for two days while
trading in its shares in Hong Kong remained suspended, sparking criticism from
investors who accused the TWSE of failing to closely monitor the market and
leaving investors in the dark.</P>
      <P>The TWSE said that in the future it will take into account a TDR-listed
company's information disclosure practices before giving a green light to allow
the company to issue new TDRs here.</P>
      <P>The company has been fined NT$50,000 by the Taiwan Stock Exchange for violating
the rules governing trading information disclosure.</P>
      <P>In a statement on its website, the exchange said it has asked Kith to correct
the inappropriate  practices by following the information disclosure rules.</P>
      <P>Trading of Kith shares resumed on Aug. 20 in Hong Kong after the company
announced that United States-based Apex, one of its major customers, filed for
bankruptcy protection.</P>
      <P>According to Kith, Apex owes Kith US$12.07 million, but it said the amount is
secured by a first priority security interest and lien against Apex's assets.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan, Hong Kong to collaborate on service sector</HEADLINE>

08/30/10  20:17:50
(By Alex Jiang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan and Hong Kong were urged Monday to forge partnerships in the service
sectors on each side to explore the growing Chinese market.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has great potential to explore business opportunities in the Chinese
service market due to the similarity of the cultures on either side of the
Taiwan Strait and the recent signing of the economic cooperation framework
agreement (ECFA) , said Chen Tain-Jy, an economics professor at National Taiwan
University, at a forum in Taipei on Taiwan-Hong Kong trade.</P>
      <P>"We need to pay special heed to this, one of the biggest opportunities in China
following the signing of the ECFA, " he said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and China have agreed to ease restrictions on certain financial and other
services under the trade pact, which is expected to take effect in the near
future.</P>
      <P>In addition, Chen said, there is still a lot of room in which the service sector
can grow in China, as it now accounts for just 40 percent of the country's GDP.</P>
      <P>He suggested that Taiwan and Hong Kong can collaborate on medical treatment,
environmental protection and cultural innovation, as the two sides have vowed to
commit to these emerging fields and can complement each other in these respects.</P>
      <P>"The development of these emerging service industries can use Taiwan's advantage
in information and communications technology, " said Chen, a former head of the
Cabinet-level Council for Economic Planning and Development.</P>
      <P>In terms of environmental protection, for example, Taiwan has achieved
remarkable progress as it is already the world's largest producer of energy-
saving LED lights, he noted.</P>
      <P>In the field of medical treatment, meanwhile, Hong Kong has rich experience in
epidemic prevention, while Taiwan is planning a system of insurance to cover
long-term care, he said.</P>
      <P>Chen also urged Taiwan and Hong Kong to remove trade barriers in the service
trade, but he did not elaborate.</P>
      <P>David Lie, who chairs the Business Cooperation Committee of the Hong Kong-Taiwan
Economic and Cultural Cooperation and Promotion Council (ECCPC) , also said at
the forum that Taiwan and Hong Kong should capitalize on each other's advantages
to increase their respective shares of the Chinese and international markets.</P>
      <P>Lawrence Lau, the former president of the Chinese University of Hong Kong, who
also spoke at the forum, said that the service trade has long been important
between Taiwan and Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>Taiwan was Hong Kong's fifth-largest export destination for service trade and
its seventh-largest source of service trade imports in 2008, he noted.</P>
      <P>He urged insurance companies in Taiwan, Hong Kong and China to set up an
international insurance center in Hong Kong in view of the fact that the three
places between them account for the world's largest life insurance market and
shipping fleets.</P>
      <P>Such an international insurance center would reduce the costs of Chinese and
Taiwanese businesses and help enhance their international competitiveness, he
said.</P>
      <P>He also encouraged Taiwanese colleges and universities to attract students from
Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>In addition, Lau proposed that travel agencies in Taiwan, Hong Kong, China and
Macao should work to attract foreigners to tour the four places under a single
collaborative program.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's semi-official organization founded in May to promote economic and

      <P>The Taiwan External Trade Development Council began to invite bids Monday for
Taiwan's pavilion featured at the 2010 Shanghai Expo and fixed its floor price
at NT$416.88 million (US$13 million).</P>
      <P>According to the tender notice issued by the council, the deadline for tendering
bids is Sept. 15, and the successful bidder will be chosen and announced the
next day.</P>
      <P>The council, which built and operated the pavilion at a cost of NT$1 billion at
the Shanghai Expo, said the value of the pavilion and its logo is estimated at
about NT$600 million to NT$700 million.</P>
      <P>The council said it set the pavilion's floor price below its estimated value
because the successful bidder will have to dismantle it and rebuild it in Taiwan
at a cost of NT$338 million.</P>
      <P>The council said it was ready to provide tender forms to interested buyers on
Monday, and listed the governments of Taipei County and Chiayi City, and Yamay
Recreation World, a theme park in Houli, Taichung County, as likely bidders.</P>
      <P>Hualien, Kinmen and Miaoli counties and Keelung City have also expressed
interest in purchasing the pavilion, according to the council.</P>
      <P>The building, shaped like a sky lantern with a transparent exterior made of
glass, was designed by prominent Taiwanese architect C. Y. Lee. It stands 23.8
meters above the ground and has floor space of 1,400 square meters.</P>
      <P>At its center is a ball 16 meters in diameter consisting of 1 million LEDS that
displays various images reflecting Taiwan's natural beauty and diverse culture.
Inside the ball is a 12-meter wide screen that shows films of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to the trade body, the Taiwan Pavilion has been one of the most
popular exhibits at the Shanghai Expo, drawing more than 400,000 visitors thus
far.</P>
      <P>According to the tender notice, the successful bidder will get not only the
building, but also its logo and two sets of computer software used to control
the display of LED images.</P>
      <P>The software has a market value of more than NT$200 million, according to the
tender notice.</P>
      <P>The winner of the tender will be required to relocate the pavilion after the
expo closes on Oct. 31. A local shipping company has promised to help whoever
acquires the pavilion ship it back to Taiwan without charge.</P>

      <P>The 2011 national defense budget proposal of NT$297.2 billion that was sent to
the legislature Monday contained a far less amount for classified programs than
the previous year, a ruling party lawmaker said Monday.</P>
      <P>Of the total amount, NT$272.7 billion was listed as open funds, while NT$24.5
billion was categorized as funds for classified spending, said Kuomintang
Legislator Lin Yu-fang.</P>
      <P>This was a significant cut of NT$14.7 billion, or 37.5 percent, in the amount of
classified funds compared to the previous annual budget, Lin said.</P>
      <P>The budget for classified programs was reduced to 8.25 percent of the total,
shrinking it to below 10 percent for the first time, he said.</P>
      <P>"The big drop was seen not because budgets have been cut significantly, but
because many items that were listed under the classified category were moved to
the open category," he said.</P>
      <P>"The national defense budget for 2011 could be most transparent in history," he
added.</P>
      <P>The overall defense budget of NT$297.2 billion was NT$200 million less than the
previous year, and represented a 16.6 percent of the 2011 national budget, he
said.</P>
      <P>Because big payments will have to be made soon in the arms deals with the United
States, he said, other weapons procurement spending for 2011 will be less than
NT$1 billion -- the lowest in recent years.</P>
      <P>As result, several other arms procurement projects have been shelved or
canceled, Lin said.</P>
      <P>However, military production and research and development of defensive arms has
remained steady, he said.</P>
      <P>"This shows that the government, while seeking to improve cross-strait
relations,  has  not ignored  the importance  of strengthening national
defense," Lin said.</P>
      <P>The Navy has listed an open budget of NT$891,000 to examine tank landing ships
in the U.S., which indicates that it may want to lease one or two Newport-class
tank landing craft, he said.</P>

      <P>Taiwan has been admitted as a member of the Inter-American Tropical Tuna
Commission and will attend a meeting of the commission in La Antigua, Guatemala
beginning Sept. 27, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement Monday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan, which took part in the commission's 10-round negotiations that
culminated in the 2003 Antigua Convention, was admitted to the body as a
"cooperating fishing entity" under the name of Chinese Taipei -- which is used

      <P>Taiwan was invited to the body by the commission when it passed the Antigua
Convention on June 27, 2003, and it became a full member when the convention
took effect on Aug. 27, the statement said.</P>
      <P>Belize, Canada, China, the Cook Islands, the European Union, Kiribati, and other
countries were also admitted to the body as members under the designation
"cooperating non parties."</P>
      <P>The Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission, established by international
convention in 1950, is responsible for the conservation and management of tuna
fishing stocks and other species targeted by tuna fishing vessels in the eastern
Pacific Ocean.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Taiwan's accession to the commission has

      <P>Yilan County, Taichung City and Changhua County are the best counties and city
in Taiwan in which to have a child, according to the results of survey released
by a magazine Monday.</P>
      <P>The survey ranking "the most suitable places to have children, " the main theme
this year of Common Health Magazine's 11th annual healthy city survey, also
judged Yunlin and Chiayi counties and Keelung and Kaohsiung cities as the most
unfavorable places in Taiwan for children.</P>
      <P>The magazine evaluated 24 cities and counties in Taiwan in the areas of child
care, childbirth and health care, economic support and children-rearing
environment to determine their competitiveness as suitable places for raising
children.</P>
      <P>Upon learning the results of the survey, the Yilan County Government  said that
although the county's resources are not abundant, it has used many different
incentives to create an environment that is suitable for giving birth.</P>
      <P>In an analysis of the results, the magazine said Taipei City ranked only average
in the areas of its notification system for slow development children and
completion of vaccinations for children under 3-year-olds.</P>

      <P>Taipei County was at the bottom in terms of green land, playgrounds, stadiums
and leisure centers per 10,000 people. The residents also believe that the
county is not suitable for having and raising children.</P>
      <P>The survey found that Kinmen and Changhua counties offer the most generous
childbirth subsidies.</P>
      <P>The parents of every new baby born in Kinmen can receive a subsidy of NT$48,355
(US$1,510), the highest in the country.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted between July 14 and August 8, with 13,444 valid samples

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan and Hong Kong were urged Monday to forge partnerships in the service
sectors on each side to explore the growing Chinese market.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has great potential to explore business opportunities in the Chinese
service market due to the similarity of the cultures on either side of the
Taiwan Strait and the recent signing of the economic cooperation framework
agreement (ECFA) , said Chen Tain-Jy, an economics professor at National Taiwan
University, at a forum in Taipei on Taiwan-Hong Kong trade.</P>
      <P>"We need to pay special heed to this, one of the biggest opportunities in China
following the signing of the ECFA, " he said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and China have agreed to ease restrictions on certain financial and other
services under the trade pact, which is expected to take effect in the near
future.</P>
      <P>In addition, Chen said, there is still a lot of room in which the service sector
can grow in China, as it now accounts for just 40 percent of the country's GDP.</P>
      <P>He suggested that Taiwan and Hong Kong can collaborate on medical treatment,
environmental protection and cultural innovation, as the two sides have vowed to
commit to these emerging fields and can complement each other in these respects.</P>
      <P>"The development of these emerging service industries can use Taiwan's advantage
in information and communications technology, " said Chen, a former head of the
Cabinet-level Council for Economic Planning and Development.</P>
      <P>In terms of environmental protection, for example, Taiwan has achieved
remarkable progress as it is already the world's largest producer of energy-
saving LED lights, he noted.</P>
      <P>In the field of medical treatment, meanwhile, Hong Kong has rich experience in
epidemic prevention, while Taiwan is planning a system of insurance to cover
long-term care, he said.</P>
      <P>Chen also urged Taiwan and Hong Kong to remove trade barriers in the service
trade, but he did not elaborate.</P>
      <P>David Lie, who chairs the Business Cooperation Committee of the Hong Kong-Taiwan
Economic and Cultural Cooperation and Promotion Council (ECCPC) , also said at
the forum that Taiwan and Hong Kong should capitalize on each other's advantages
to increase their respective shares of the Chinese and international markets.</P>
      <P>Lawrence Lau, the former president of the Chinese University of Hong Kong, who
also spoke at the forum, said that the service trade has long been important
between Taiwan and Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>Taiwan was Hong Kong's fifth-largest export destination for service trade and
its seventh-largest source of service trade imports in 2008, he noted.</P>
      <P>He urged insurance companies in Taiwan, Hong Kong and China to set up an
international insurance center in Hong Kong in view of the fact that the three
places between them account for the world's largest life insurance market and
shipping fleets.</P>
      <P>Such an international insurance center would reduce the costs of Chinese and
Taiwanese businesses and help enhance their international competitiveness, he
said.</P>
      <P>He also encouraged Taiwanese colleges and universities to attract students from
Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>In addition, Lau proposed that travel agencies in Taiwan, Hong Kong, China and
Macao should work to attract foreigners to tour the four places under a single
collaborative program.</P>
      <P>The forum was held alongside the first meeting between the ECCPC and its
Taiwanese counterpart, the Taiwan-Hong Kong Economic and Cultural Cooperation
Council (ECCC), since the two organizations were set up earlier this year to
strengthen bilateral ties.</P>

      <P>The Taiwan External Trade Development Council began to invite bids Monday for
Taiwan's pavilion featured at the 2010 Shanghai Expo and fixed its floor price
at NT$416.88 million (US$13 million).</P>
      <P>According to the tender notice issued by the council, the deadline for tendering
bids is Sept. 15, and the successful bidder will be chosen and announced the
next day.</P>
      <P>The council, which built and operated the pavilion at a cost of NT$1 billion at
the Shanghai Expo, said the value of the pavilion and its logo is estimated at
about NT$600 million to NT$700 million.</P>
      <P>The council said it set the pavilion's floor price below its estimated value
because the successful bidder will have to dismantle it and rebuild it in Taiwan
at a cost of NT$338 million.</P>
      <P>The council said it was ready to provide tender forms to interested buyers on
Monday, and listed the governments of Taipei County and Chiayi City, and Yamay
Recreation World, a theme park in Houli, Taichung County, as likely bidders.</P>
      <P>Hualien, Kinmen and Miaoli counties and Keelung City have also expressed
interest in purchasing the pavilion, according to the council.</P>
      <P>The building, shaped like a sky lantern with a transparent exterior made of
glass, was designed by prominent Taiwanese architect C. Y. Lee. It stands 23.8
meters above the ground and has floor space of 1,400 square meters.</P>
      <P>At its center is a ball 16 meters in diameter consisting of 1 million LEDS that
displays various images reflecting Taiwan's natural beauty and diverse culture.
Inside the ball is a 12-meter wide screen that shows films of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to the trade body, the Taiwan Pavilion has been one of the most
popular exhibits at the Shanghai Expo, drawing more than 400,000 visitors thus
far.</P>
      <P>According to the tender notice, the successful bidder will get not only the
building, but also its logo and two sets of computer software used to control
the display of LED images.</P>
      <P>The software has a market value of more than NT$200 million, according to the
tender notice.</P>
      <P>The winner of the tender will be required to relocate the pavilion after the
expo closes on Oct. 31. A local shipping company has promised to help whoever
acquires the pavilion ship it back to Taiwan without charge.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Funding for classified programs cut in 2011 defense budget</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The 2011 national defense budget proposal of NT$297.2 billion that was sent to
the legislature Monday contained a far less amount for classified programs than
the previous year, a ruling party lawmaker said Monday.</P>
      <P>Of the total amount, NT$272.7 billion was listed as open funds, while NT$24.5
billion was categorized as funds for classified spending, said Kuomintang
Legislator Lin Yu-fang.</P>
      <P>This was a significant cut of NT$14.7 billion, or 37.5 percent, in the amount of
classified funds compared to the previous annual budget, Lin said.</P>
      <P>The budget for classified programs was reduced to 8.25 percent of the total,
shrinking it to below 10 percent for the first time, he said.</P>
      <P>"The big drop was seen not because budgets have been cut significantly, but
because many items that were listed under the classified category were moved to
the open category," he said.</P>
      <P>"The national defense budget for 2011 could be most transparent in history," he
added.</P>
      <P>The overall defense budget of NT$297.2 billion was NT$200 million less than the
previous year, and represented a 16.6 percent of the 2011 national budget, he
said.</P>
      <P>Because big payments will have to be made soon in the arms deals with the United
States, he said, other weapons procurement spending for 2011 will be less than
NT$1 billion -- the lowest in recent years.</P>
      <P>As result, several other arms procurement projects have been shelved or
canceled, Lin said.</P>
      <P>However, military production and research and development of defensive arms has
remained steady, he said.</P>
      <P>"This shows that the government, while seeking to improve cross-strait
relations,  has  not ignored  the importance  of strengthening national
defense," Lin said.</P>
      <P>The Navy has listed an open budget of NT$891,000 to examine tank landing ships
in the U.S., which indicates that it may want to lease one or two Newport-class
tank landing craft, he said.</P>

      <P>Taiwan has been admitted as a member of the Inter-American Tropical Tuna
Commission and will attend a meeting of the commission in La Antigua, Guatemala
beginning Sept. 27, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement Monday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan, which took part in the commission's 10-round negotiations that
culminated in the 2003 Antigua Convention, was admitted to the body as a
"cooperating fishing entity" under the name of Chinese Taipei -- which is used
for Taiwan in many other international bodies.</P>
      <P>Taiwan was invited to the body by the commission when it passed the Antigua
Convention on June 27, 2003, and it became a full member when the convention
took effect on Aug. 27, the statement said.</P>
      <P>Belize, Canada, China, the Cook Islands, the European Union, Kiribati, and other
countries were also admitted to the body as members under the designation
"cooperating non parties."</P>
      <P>The Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission, established by international
convention in 1950, is responsible for the conservation and management of tuna
fishing stocks and other species targeted by tuna fishing vessels in the eastern
Pacific Ocean.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Taiwan's accession to the commission has
set a precedent for the island's participation in similar regional fishery
management groups in the future.</P>

      <P>Taiwan and Australia will sign a memorandum of cooperation on green power
development at a two-day meeting that opened Monday in Taichung, according to

      <P>The bureau said the two countries will sign a Taiwan-Australia memorandum of
cooperation on energy and minerals at the 16th Taiwan-Australia Joint Energy and
Minerals Trade, Investment and Cooperation Consultations, which has been held
annually since 1993.</P>
      <P>The deal represents an effort to improve mutual understanding in energy policy

trend of energy saving and carbon emissions reduction.</P>
      <P>The meeting, which rotates between Australia and Taiwan and is taking place in
Taichung on Aug. 30-31 this year, will discuss energy policy, supply-demand
issues related to traditional energy, energy efficiency,  renewable energy,
carbon emission reductions  and cooperation on green power technology.</P>
      <P>The bureau noted that Taiwan imports over 2.5 million tons of coal, or roughly
50 percent of its needs, from Australia per year, and also relies heavily on
Australia for its aluminum, iron and copper,  highlighting  the close
relationship  between the two countries.</P>
      <P>A total of about 50 representatives participated in the meeting, including

      <P>Yilan County, Taichung City and Changhua County are the best counties and city
in Taiwan in which to have a child, according to the results of survey released
by a magazine Monday.</P>
      <P>The survey ranking "the most suitable places to have children, " the main theme
this year of Common Health Magazine's 11th annual healthy city survey, also
judged Yunlin and Chiayi counties and Keelung and Kaohsiung cities as the most
unfavorable places in Taiwan for children.</P>
      <P>The magazine evaluated 24 cities and counties in Taiwan in the areas of child
care, childbirth and health care, economic support and children-rearing
environment to determine their competitiveness as suitable places for raising
children.</P>
      <P>Upon learning the results of the survey, the Yilan County Government  said that
although the county's resources are not abundant, it has used many different
incentives to create an environment that is suitable for giving birth.</P>
      <P>In an analysis of the results, the magazine said Taipei City ranked only average
in the areas of its notification system for slow development children and
completion of vaccinations for children under 3-year-olds.</P>
      <P>It ranked at the bottom of the list in the examining children's eyesight.</P>
      <P>Taipei County was at the bottom in terms of green land, playgrounds, stadiums
and leisure centers per 10,000 people. The residents also believe that the
county is not suitable for having and raising children.</P>
      <P>The survey found that Kinmen and Changhua counties offer the most generous
childbirth subsidies.</P>
      <P>The parents of every new baby born in Kinmen can receive a subsidy of NT$48,355
(US$1,510), the highest in the country.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted between July 14 and August 8, with 13,444 valid samples
collected. It had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.8-4.4 percentage points.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's first lady Chow Mei-ching was a big hit among the children of a Haitian
orphanage on Monday local time as she kicked off her first overseas humanitarian
trip as the first lady.</P>
      <P>Immediately  after  she  landed  at  Toussaint  Louverture International
Airport, Chow and her daughter Lesley Ma visited the children being cared for by
Solidarite and Fraternite, a local school and orphanage located in Port-au-
Prince.</P>
      <P>The mother-daughter duo was warmly welcomed by the children, who greeted her by
singing the national anthems of the Republic of China (Taiwan) and Haiti while
unfurling the national flags of the two countries side by side.</P>
      <P>The children also performed a traditional Haitian dance to welcome their guests.</P>
      <P>Known for her strong advocacy of child welfare, the first lady returned the
affection by showering the children with hugs and performing a tune on the clay
flute she recently learned to play.</P>
      <P>Chow and her daughter also taught the children how to make a bamboo dragonfly, a
traditional Taiwanese toy, and a fruit gelatin dessert.</P>
      <P>Among the major highlights of the trip still to come was the first lady's
encounter with four Haitian children who are being sponsored by her and
President Ma Ying-jeou, said World Vision.</P>
      <P>She will also visit nongovernmental organization Food for the Poor, a big relief
agency in the United States that enjoys a close partnership with Taiwan, and
refugee camps to offer comfort to people left homeless by a devastating
earthquake that ravaged Haiti on Jan. 12, 2010.</P>
      <P>Chow was expected to conclude her day Monday by hosting a banquet attended by
distinguished guests such as Taiwan's ambassador to Haiti Liu Bang-zyh, the head
of Taiwan's agricultural and technical mission in Haiti Carlos Hsiang, local
Taiwanese businessmen and Taiwan embassy staff.</P>
      <P>The embassy explained that because the first lady is not making an official
state visit and the trip is purely for humanitarian purposes, she will maintain
her typically low-key profile and will not meet with any top Haitian government
officials.</P>
      <P>The first lady and her daughter are expected to end their visit in Haiti on
Sept. 1 and head to the Dominican Republic for a two-day humanitarian visit. She
will return to Taiwan on Sept. 5.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Shares of Hon Hai Precision Industry, the world's largest contract electronics
manufacturer, fell sharply in Tuesday morning trade after the company reported
lower than expected earnings for the first half of this year, dealers said.</P>
      <P>As of 11: 30 a.m., Hon Hai shares had fallen 5.79 percent to NT$114.0 (US$3.56)
with 61.70 million shares changing hands, while the benchmark weighted index was
down 1.35 percent at 7,636.92.</P>
      <P>Hon Hai reported Monday that it posted NT$34.74 billion in net after-tax
earnings in the first half of the year, up 22.6 percent from a year earlier,
with earnings per share at NT$3.61.</P>
      <P>Tom Tang, an analyst with MasterLink Securities, said the market consensus was
that Hon Hai's EPS for 2010 would hit NT$8.5.</P>
      <P>"Now, the EPS in the first half was less than half of the forecast," Tang said.
"With concerns over global demand for high-tech products running deeper,
investors are afraid that it is very unlikely that Hon Hai will meet the
forecast."</P>
      <P>Tang said he suspected the current selling largely came from foreign
institutional investors, who hold about 50 percent of Hon Hai's shares in
circulation.</P>
      <P>Tang attributed the worse than expected earnings for the first half reflected
the disappointing results reported by Hong Kong-listed subsidiary Foxconn
International Holdings.</P>
      <P>The company reported Monday it registered a net loss of US$143 million in the
first six months, compared with a net loss of US$18.70 million recorded in the
first half of last year.</P>
      <P>"I estimate that Foxconn International's higher losses eroded Hon Hai's EPS by
about NT$0.4. As the global economy is slowing, uncertainty over Foxconn
International's bottom line has unnerved investors," Tang said.</P>
      <P>Daiwa Securities said it fears Hon Hai's gross margin will fall in the second
half of this year as the group announced two wage hikes for its Chinese workers
in late June.</P>
      <P>In the second quarter of this year, Hon Hai's consolidated gross margin fell to
8.11 percent from 8.65 percent recorded in the first quarter.</P>
      <P>Daiwa Securities rated Hon Hai a market underperformer with a target price of
NT$105.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Widespread debate over Taiwan's widening wealth gap emerged following the
release of the country's wealth distribution statistics for 2009 by the
Directorate General for Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS).</P>
      <P>In a Cabinet meeting held last week,  Premier Wu Den-yih instructed the DGBAS to
maintain contact with the Council for Economic Development and Planning (CEPD)
before releasing important statistics in the future, so that the CEPD could help
interpret the figures from a macroeconomic perspective.</P>
      <P>Wu's directive may seem reasonable, but it has interfered with the independence
of the government's statistics. Once deprived of their independence, government
statistics will become political publicity, with all bad news blacked out.</P>
      <P>What Taiwan needs today is reflection, rather than optimistic interpretation, by
government leaders. The government must abandon its ostrich mentality and
respond rapidly to problems in order to chart a bright future for Taiwan's
economy. (Editorial abstract -- Aug. 31, 2010)</P>

    <DATELINE>08/31/10  12:48:13</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>As the elderly woman got out of a car at a parking lot near the Liang-shean Tang
Foundation complex in Puli township, she was greeted with shouts of "Grandma,
Grandma" from a group of teenagers waiting nearby for shuttle bus to take them
to night school.</P>
      <P>Chen Chou, 80, was carrying bags of vegetables and groceries that she planned to
cook for the teenagers, who were in fact not related to her.</P>
      <P>"I like to cook for them because they are still growing, and boxed and bagged
ready-to-eat meals are not good for their health, " she said.</P>
      <P>Cooking fresh healthy meals is just one the services Chen performs for young
people in her community.  She also offers scholarships to children from
impoverished families and provides shelter, care and counseling to teens and
pre-teens who get into trouble with the law.</P>
      <P>Undeterred by age or by illness, Chen has been working for 40 years to help
disadvantaged families avoid the pain that she suffered.</P>
      <P>Born into a poor family herself, Chen was adopted by a couple in Puli, near her
hometown of Yuchi. She did not receive a formal education and didn't learn to
read, or write until she was around 50. She got married at the age of 18 and had
seven children.</P>
      <P>However, within a few years, Chen was struck by a series of tragedies that
ripped her family and her life apart. Three of her children died young from
illnesses because the family could not afford medical treatment, and another
committed suicide at the age of 17 because he could not bear to watch his
parents  struggle financially and otherwise.</P>
      <P>"It was the deepest pain in my life and one that I cannot forget, " Chen said.
"Now all the children in the world are my children. We must cherish every one
who is still."</P>
      <P>At the age of 39, Chen was diagnosed with colorectal cancer. As chemotherapy and
other medical treatments proved ineffective, she decided to spend some time at a
temple in Puli praying for healing. Chen said that by some miracle she went into
remission.</P>
      <P>It was at this point that her focus in life changed.</P>
      <P>"God gave me more time so I had to dedicate the rest of my life to doing good,"
she said.</P>
      <P>Chen set about working to raise funds to build temples. Over the next 14 years,
she helped to fund the construction of 13 temples, including Liang-shean Tang,
by making and selling rice cakes.</P>
      <P>At the same time, she began offering religious counseling to people who came to
her for advice about problems in their lives. She also got involved in volunteer
community work and helping to rescue young people who were going astray.</P>
      <P>"A temple is a place that provides support for faith and spiritual living, but
religion is not just about erecting temples, " said Chen, who became known as
Grandma Puli. "It would be a pity we didn't go beyond building temples."</P>
      <P>From the Liang-shean Tang Temple grew a charity foundation by the same name,
which was established in 1983 in Puli with donations from the public and
proceeds from the sale of Chen's family property.</P>
      <P>At a juvenile center that is part of the foundation, young people and children
from disadvantaged families can find shelter, food and guidance.</P>
      <P>"Fortunately, Grandma appeared at a time when I had lost my way and she guided
me onto the right path, " said a young man only by his surname Lee.</P>
      <P>At first, Chen managed to keep the center running by selling wild vegetables,
handmade rice cakes and rice dumplings.</P>
      <P>Today, the center is supported by charity donations and houses some 26
teenagers, most of whom are delinquents or from broken families.</P>
      <P>"It is not the children's fault (that their families have broken apart)," Che
said.</P>
      <P>Grandma  Puli said she knows  nothing  about psychological counseling, but
through example, she tries to instill in the children the values of love and
compassion.</P>
      <P>"My efforts have been rewarded," she said, adding that she was happy to see
almost 100 children get back on track with her help at the center.</P>
      <P>"If we can reach them in time, they can become pillars of the nation," she said.</P>
      <P>Many of the children and youth she has helped have gone on to become her
godchildren and they usually gather twice a year, in June and December, to
celebrate her birthday and express their gratitude to her.</P>
      <P>"Grandma always told us we are human beings and should act as such, " said one
of the young men who is known by his surname Lin. "I felt so well cared for when
I was at Liang-shean Tang."</P>
      <P>Inspired by Grandma Puli, Lin and Lee have set themselves the goal of raising
NT$1 million to help her realize her dream of building a home for juvenile
delinquents.</P>
      <P>Chen launched the project last year with the aim of providing accommodation,
education and career guidance for close to 100 juvenile delinquents and school
dropouts between the ages of 12 and 18. If she can raise the NT$30 million
shortfall in the NT$140 million budget, the home will be completed by the end of
the year.</P>
      <P>Her chances of reaching her goal seem to be growing, as her efforts are gaining
high-level support.</P>
      <P>Earlier this month, President Ma Ying-jeou attended a fundraiser that Chen held
in Taipei for the juvenile home project. Soon after, Nantou County Magistrate
Lee Chao-ching made a commitment to nominate Grandma Puli for inclusion on
various philanthropist lists worldwide, which he said would give her
international publicity and help to promote the project.</P>
      <P>But Chen later turned down Lee's proposal. In a letter to the county government
on Aug. 30, she said that she is just a facilitator and that many other people
have contributed to the work.</P>
      <P>However she defines her role, Chen has no intention of giving up or even slowing
down, despite her continued battle over the years with various types of cancer
-- gastric, nasopharyngeal, laryngeal and cervical -- and the debilitating pain
she suffers as a result of chemotherapy.</P>
      <P>"There are lots of things that I still have to do - I cannot die right now, "
she said. "Maybe God will let me go after the work is done." CNA Staff Writer

    <HEADLINE>Talk of the day--National defense budget for 2011 in five-year low</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>08/31/10  13:21:16
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The proposed 2011 national defense budget of NT$297.2 billion was sent to the
Legislature Monday. The figure was the lowest in nearly five years and
represents less than three percent of the GDP.</P>
      <P>Of the total amount, NT$272.7 billion was listed as open funds, while NT$24.5
billion was budgeted for classified spending, down nearly 40 percent, or the
lowest in history.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from local media coverage of the subject: China
Times:</P>
      <P>Legislator Lin Yu-fang of the ruling Kuomintang said that NT$45 billion of the
total national defense budget for 2011 will be used to pay for weapons bought
from the United States.</P>
      <P>Lin said this is mainly because the U.S. has announced up to US$11 billion in
arms sales to Taiwan over the past two years, so big payments will have to be
made next year.</P>
      <P>For this reason, other weapons procurement spending for 2011 will be less than
NT$1 billion -- the lowest in recent years, Lin said.</P>
      <P>Even if some weapons purchases originally scheduled for next year may be shelved
or canceled, military production and research and development of counterattack
or defensive weapons has remained steady, he said.</P>
      <P>Lin also said the production of Hsiung Feng 2E surface-to-surface cruise missile
system developed by the Chunghsan Institute of Science and Technology in Taiwan
has been on track, and some of them are expected to be commissioned at the end
of the year.</P>
      <P>Lin said this will prove that the Ma administration, while improving cross-
Taiwan  Strait relations,  has not ignored the importance of strengthening
national defense capability. Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>Legislator Lin said classified funds under the 2011 national defense budget will
be NT$24.5 billion, down 37.5 percent from the NT$39.2 billion budgeted this
year.</P>
      <P>The big drop was not because the classified budget was cut significantly, but
because many items that were listed as classified were moved to the open
category, he said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the financial straits of the nation have squeezed the scale and
progress of the recruiting system.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of National Defense said in its five-year military personnel
buildup report that under the military streamlining program, the number of
servicemen in Taiwan's military will be set at 215,000 people. Reflecting the
difficulty of recruiting people, it set a recruiting goal of 90 percent of the
total, or 193,000 people, for 2011.</P>
      <P>Though the military said it will gradually increase the number of recruits, it
will not stress pushing for the completion of the new recruiting system by 2014
as had been originally planned. (Aug. 31, 2010)</P>

    <DATELINE>08/31/10  13:26:55
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The issue of whether to increase the pay of civil servants sparked a heated
debate recently. Notably, both the proponents and opponents are aiming at a
wider goal: raising the wages of ordinary workers.</P>
      <P>This indicates that the government should not focus only on pay hikes for civil
servants, but should think about how to expand employment and boost the income
of average citizens so as to share the fruits of economic growth with more
diligent people.</P>
      <P>Another more important purpose of raising workers' salaries is to narrow the
wealth gap between the rich and the poor.</P>
      <P>In this regard, the government of President Ma Ying-jeou should not assume the
sole responsibility. The business sector, which has been granted various tax
reductions by the Ma administration at the cost of over NT$100 billion in
revenue, also has a responsibility to give back to society. (Editorial abstract

    <TEXT>
      <P>Nearly half of the people working in the high-tech industry do not want to stay
in their jobs because of long working hours and heavy work pressure, according
to the results of an online survey released Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The survey, conducted by the online 104 Job Bank, found that 34 percent of
respondents with work experience at high-tech companies have left the sector,
while another 12 percent said they are planning to quit, for a total of 46
percent unwilling to stay in the high-tech field.</P>
      <P>In contrast, however, about 67 percent of workers who have no experience said
they would like to work for high-tech companies.</P>
      <P>To respondents who had never worked in the sector but wanted to, the most
desirable companies to work would be Hon Hai Precision Industry, the world's
largest contract maker of electronics products (49 percent), Taiwan
Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (47 percent) and ASUSTek Computer Inc. (33
percent).</P>
      <P>For workers in the industry, the best three companies to work for are TSMC (44
percent) , MediaTek Inc. (32 percent) and HTC Corp. (29 percent).</P>
      <P>When respondents who had left the high-tech sector were asked why they quit
their jobs, 24 percent cited job cuts and furloughs, 23 percent cited long
working hours, 21 percent pointed to heavy stress at work, and 21 percent said
their income was not in proportion to their effort.</P>
      <P>Experienced high-tech workers warned those without high-tech experience to not
have high expectations of salaries and benefits (58 percent) from high-tech
companies and said they should be prepared for long working hours (45 percent)
and sudden big job changes (34 percent).</P>
      <P>In the view of these respondents, engineering R&amp;D talent will be most in
demand over the next five years (45 percent) , while the LED industry is
expected to become a leading sector (33 percent) during that time, the survey
said.</P>
      <P>The poll, which was conducted August 10-11, collected 3,002 valid samples, of
which 2,000 were from people with high-tech working experience and 1,002 were
from those without high-tech experience. It had a confidence level of 95 percent
and a margin of error of plus or minus 1.7 percentage points.</P>

      <P>The Taiwan government has rejected the sale of the country's biggest life
insurance company, Nan Shan Life, to a Hong Kong consortium, the Ministry of
Economic Affairs (MOEA) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The consortium, which comprises Primus Financial Holdings and China Strategic
Holdings, agreed last October to buy the company for US$2.15 billion after it
was put up for sale by its parent group American International Group (AIG) .
However, the deal stalled a few months later due to regulatory concerns in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The MOEA's Investment Commission on Tuesday turned down the application for the
sale after reviewing the deal.</P>
      <P>Several buyers, including Taiwan's Chinatrust Financial Holding Co. Ltd., and
some Japanese and Middle East companies, had expressed interest in bidding for
Nan Shan Life if the consortium failed to secure the deal.</P>
      <P>Chinatrust FHC had previously bid for Nan Shan when AIG, amid financial

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan share prices closed down 1.61 percent Tuesday as investors reacted to a
Wall Street fall overnight amid renewed concerns over weakening global economic
fundamentals, dealers said.</P>
      <P>The weighted index fell 124.92 points to 7,616.28, after moving between 7,577.10
and 7,687.47, on turnover of NT$115.80 billion (US$3.62 billion).</P>
      <P>The market opened down 0.93 percent after Wall Street's 1.39 percent decline
pushed the Dow Jones Industrial Average to the brink of tumbling below the key
10,000 barrier, dealers said.</P>
      <P>Selling accelerated across the board with Hon Hai Precision Industry, the
world's largest contract electronics manufacturer, dragging down the index on
weaker-than-expected results for the first half of 2010, they said.</P>
      <P>A total of 3,087 stocks closed down and 692 finished higher, with 151 remaining
unchanged.</P>
      <P>Machinery and electronics stocks suffered the steepest decline, losing 2.3
percent. Paper and pulp stocks fell 2.1 percent, and cement, foodstuff and
construction shares lost 1.9 percent.</P>
      <P>The textile sector fell 0.8 percent, the financial sector lost 0.7 percent and
the plastics and chemical sector lost 0.6 percent.</P>
      <P>"It was no surprise that Wall Street remained choppy on lingering worries over
the economy, " Mega Securities analyst Alex Huang said. "It was also no surprise
that the local bourse followed suit, triggering stop loss selling throughout the
session."</P>
      <P>Huang said it is very possible that the Dow will test 10,000 points again soon,
"and as a result market sentiment has turned very cautious."</P>
      <P>Judging from the losses suffered by large cap stocks on Tuesday, Huang believed
the selling largely came from institutional investors, in particular foreign
institutional investors who hold a big chunk of high-tech bellwether firms.</P>
      <P>Foreign and Chinese institutional investors were net sellers of NT$5.3 billion
in shares on the day.</P>
      <P>The local market could fall to below the nearest technical support level at
around 7,600 points soon on weak confidence, the analyst said.</P>
      <P>Huang said the high-tech sector remained haunted by concerns over weakening
global demand in the second half of this year, adding, "Its disappointing
results for the first six months cemented such fears."</P>
      <P>"Without a resilient electronics sector, the local market is not likely to
reverse its weakness," he said.</P>
      <P>In the electronics sector,  Hon Hai fell 6.61 percent to NT$113.00, smartphone
maker HTC shed 6.25 percent to NT$585.00 and Largan Precision, a digital camera
lens producer, lost 6.02 percent to NT$578.00.</P>
      <P>Among old economy industrial stocks, Taiwan Pulp &amp; Paper fell 3.58 percent
to NT$14.80 and Wei-Chuan Foods lost 5.08 percent to NT$32.70.</P>

      <P>Chunghong Holdings Ltd., a Chinese printed circuit board (PCB) firm, is seeking
to raise funds in Taiwan through a primary listing on the local main board,
underwriter Capital Securities said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Capital Securities said Chunghong, which is registered in the Cayman Islands, is
planning to issue 7.61 million new shares to raise about NT$216.8 million
(US$6.77 million) and has filed an application with the Taiwan Stock Exchange
for the listing.</P>
      <P>According to its prospectus, Chunghong expects the listing plan to be completed
in the first quarter of next year.</P>
      <P>Aside from making PCBs, Chunghong also provides surface mount technology (SMT)
to make electronic circuits in which the components are mounted on the surface
of the PCBs.</P>
      <P>The prospectus said the company will allocate a large portion of the funds it
raises from the primary listing to add three SMT production lines.</P>
      <P>Currently, Chunghong operates production facilities in China's Suzhou, Shenyang
and Yantai, and it teamed up with LG Electronics to set up a plant in Poland in
2007, aiming to boost sales in the European market.</P>
      <P>In 2009, 68.98 percent of Chunghong's total sales went to Asia, 21.58 percent
went to the Americas, and 9.44 percent went to Europe.</P>
      <P>Among its major customers are Samsung Electronics, Kingston Technology and LG
Electronics, the prospectus said.</P>
      <P>Chunghong, which was founded by Taiwanese businessmen operating overseas, was
listed on the Singapore Exchange in 2007 but delisted voluntarily in 2009.</P>
      <P>The company decided to come back to Taiwan for its primary listing after years
of effort by the government to persuade Taiwanese companies operating abroad to
use the island as a fund-raising site, the Taiwan Stock Exchange said in a
statement on its website.</P>
      <P>The company's net profit in the first of the year was NT$96.66 million, on pace
to exceed its net income of NT$112 million for all of 2009.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou visited the Central Emergency Operation Center Tuesday to
inspect preparations amid the approach of Tropical Storm Namtheun, as the
Central Weather Bureau (CWB) predicted a possible threat from Lionrock, another
tropical storm.</P>
      <P>Ma instructed all relevant units to be on alert, even though weather reports had
forecast Namtheun's strength to be weakening.</P>
      <P>Ma said it is the responsibility of local governments to make every effort to
prevent disasters and to launch rescue missions, while the central government is
obliged to offer every possible support for the local governments in this
regard.</P>
      <P>Noting that rainfall had surpassed 300 mm in Taipei City's Zhuzihu area, Ma said
the runoff will flow directly into the Keelung River, which runs through the
city, so the city must take precautions against possible flooding.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, Premier Wu Den-yih also visited the center to hear briefings
on the movement of the storms.</P>
      <P>The CWB reported that as of 4 p.m., Namtheun was centered 130 km west-northwest
of Taipei, packing maximum sustained winds of 65 kph and moving west-southwest
at 6 kph.</P>
      <P>The tropical storm was expected to threaten the northern Taiwan area covering
Taipei, Taoyuan, Hsinchu and Miaoli counties, even though it was weakening, the
CWB said.</P>
      <P>The bureau also said Lionrock was currently at sea close to the Tongsha islands,
moving slowly in an easterly direction.</P>
      <P>Earlier, CWB forecasters reported that another storm system, Kompasu, had gained
momentum and had strengthened from a tropical storm into a typhoon earlier in
the day. It was centered 870 km east of Taiwan, moving northwest at 24 kph.</P>

the birth rate, Changhua County Magistrate Cho Po-yuan said Monday.</P>
      <P>According to the results of a survey released Monday by Common Health Magazine,
Changhua County, Yilan County and Taichung City are the three localities in
Taiwan that were rated as the most favorable places to have a child.</P>
      <P>The main criteria used in the survey was care for children, childbirth care,
financial support and child-rearing environment.</P>
      <P>Cho pointed out that Changhua's fertility rate stood at 1.15 births per woman in
2009, which was higher than the nation's average of 1.02 births per woman.</P>
      <P>He attributed the achievement to the favorable living environment provided by
Changhua, which has the second-lowest unemployment rate and the lowest crime
rate in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Also, the county has provided free lunches to elementary and junior high school
students since 2009,  greatly reducing the financial burden on parents, the
magistrate said.</P>

      <P>China increased its defense budget in 2010 by 7.5 percent to US$78 billion,
while most other countries were cutting military spending, according to the
latest report on China's military strength.</P>
      <P>The annual report, submitted Tuesday by Taiwan's Ministry of National Defense
(MND) to the Legislative Yuan, said China did not follow the general trend of
reduced defense budgets in the wake of the global financial crisis.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taiwan was among the countries that cut defense spending, the report
said. Taiwan's 2011 defense budget proposal of NT$297.2 billion (US$9.27
billion) is NT$200 million less than the previous year and accounts for 16.6
percent of the country's entire budget, the report said.</P>
      <P>However,  the MND has allocated  NT$77.6  billion for the construction of living
quarters for military personnel and their families, which brings the ministry's
full budget to NT$374.8 billion or 2.73 percent of the country's gross domestic
product.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou promised during his presidential election campaign to
raise the defense budget to 3 percent of GDP, which is the level it was at
before the Democratic Progressive Party came to power in 2000.</P>
      <P>The MND report warned that Beijing has launched a "charming offensive" against
Taiwan and is only being accommodating on issues that do not undermine its claim
to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Beijing has never let up in its efforts to block the U.S.' sale of arms to
Taiwan and would go to great lengths to strengthen its ability to invade Taiwan,
despite warming ties across the Taiwan Strait, the report said.</P>
      <P>If Taiwan pushes for permanent independence from China, acquires weapons of mass
destruction, or erupts into civil chaos, China could decide to attack, according
to the report.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's soccer community voiced its opposition Tuesday to a plan by the Taipei
City government to convert the country's only dedicated  soccer stadium into a
permanent exhibition hall after the conclusion of the Taipei International Flora
Exposition.</P>
      <P>Taipei City Councilor Wu Su-yao and representatives of local soccer groups said
at a press conference that the city government should keep its promise to
restore the stadium to its original use after the Flora Expo, to be held between
Nov. 6, 2010 and April 25, 2011.</P>
      <P>They said Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin promised two years ago that the stadium
would be closed only "temporarily" to serve as the venue for indoor floral
design competitions and special exhibits during the Flora Expo.</P>
      <P>But now the city government and the Ministry of Economic Affairs are planning to
permanently convert the stadium and the surrounding area into a display center
for top quality products from Taiwan, Wu said.</P>
      <P>"It is really sad for soccer fans that the Zhongshan Soccer Stadium will no
longer exist and function as a sports facility because of the Flora Expo, " said
Chang Yao-min, a former soccer player who now coaches  a soccer team for the
Shilin Sports Federation.</P>
      <P>Kuo Cheng-deng, founder of the Taipei Veterans General Hospital (TVGH) Football
Association, also stressed that the Zhongshan Soccer Stadium is the only stadium
in the country designed for soccer and approved by FIFA for international
matches.</P>
      <P>"If it is demolished, soccer matches will have to be held at non-soccer-
specific stadiums, such as the Kaohsiung Stadium or Taipei Stadium, " Kuo said.
"Soccer will therefore have to share limited space with other sports," he added.</P>
      <P>The Taipei City government responded that it has planned some supplementary
measures to deal with the issue.</P>
      <P>Wang San-chung, chief secretary of the Department of Economic Development under
the city government, said that more soccer fields will be built for the city's
schools with soccer teams.</P>
      <P>He also suggested using Yin Feng Sports Park, Bailing Sports Park, and Taipei

    <TEXT>
      <P>Quanta Computer Inc., the world's largest notebook computer ODM, said Tuesday it
has lowered its forecast for shipments for the third quarter of this year to
reflect weakening global demand.</P>
      <P>Quanta Vice Chairman and President C.C. Leung said at an investors' conference
that based on the market reality, notebook computer shipments for the third
quarter could either rise 5 percent or fall 5 percent from the second quarter
figures.</P>
      <P>The company had previously forecast that shipments for the July-September period
would increase 10 percent to 15 percent from the previous quarter.</P>
      <P>Leung said the forecast was cut based on a slowing global economy and weakening
economic fundamentals, which have dragged down demand for consumer electronics
in developed countries.</P>
      <P>However, Leung said, demand is expected to pick up in the fourth quarter, which
is the peak season for the global hi-tech sector. Quanta, therefore, has no
plans to lower its forecast of 40 precent growth for the entire 2010, he said.</P>
      <P>The company expects to record notebook computer shipments of 50 million units
for the year.</P>
      <P>In the first half of this year, Quanta posted NT$10.43 billion (US$326 million)
in net profit, up 12 percent from a year earlier, with earnings per share at
NT$2.76.</P>
      <P>In the second quarter, the company's gross margin fell to 3.4 percent from 4.1
percent recorded in the first quarter, largely on higher operating costs.</P>
      <P>The decline was worse than expected, analysts said.</P>
      <P>The company is preparing to diversify its business in an attempt to offset the
falling gross margin in notebook computer ODM business, the analysts said.</P>
      <P>Leung said the notebook computer ODM business currently accounts for about 78
percent of the company's total sales, but the figure is expected to fall to 75
percent in October and the company is aiming to further lower its percentage of
notebook computer ODM business year by year.</P>
      <P>Despite the smaller gross margin, the company remained profitable based on its
EPS and was still competitive in the world market, he said.</P>

      <P>The government has rejected the American International Group's (AIG's) sale of
its subsidiary, Nan Shan Life Insurance Co., to a consortium, the Ministry of
Economic Affairs (MOEA) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>"The members of the review commission did not give approval as the case did not
obtain the permit or consent of the regulator, " Investment Commission Chairman
Hwang Jung-chiou told reporters soon after the commission meeting.</P>
      <P>The consortium, comprising Primus Financial Holdings Ltd. and China Strategic
Holdings Ltd., can appeal the decision within 30 days of receiving the notice,
he said.</P>
      <P>The consortium agreed last October to buy AIG's 97.57-percent stake in Nan Shan
for US$2.15 billion after AIG put the Taiwanese insurer up for sale following a
U.S. government bailout.</P>
      <P>However, the deal stalled a few months later due to regulatory concerns in
Taiwan, including the alleged involvement of funds from China.</P>
      <P>Chinese investors are banned by law from investing in Taiwanese insurance
companies.</P>
      <P>The consortium replaced several of its shareholders at different times after
they were considered to be Chinese investors.</P>
      <P>The series of changes prompted Taiwan's Financial Supervisory Commission to cast
doubt over the consortium's management and long-term commitment, said Emile
Chang, deputy executive secretary of the commission.</P>
      <P>Some of Nan Shan's 37,000 sales staff have staged several street rallies  to
demand protection  of their work rights over the controversial sale.</P>
      <P>Wedding Lan, a spokesman for Nan Shan's labor union, told CNA in a telephone
interview that he welcomed the government's rejection of the proposed sale.</P>
      <P>He added that if any new buyers come forward, they should abide by the law and
protect the rights of Nan Shan clients and employees.</P>
      <P>Founded in 1963, the Taiwanese insurer has some 4 million policyholders. It has
NT$1.73 trillion-worth of assets, accounting for 15.32 percent of Taiwan's total
insurance sector.</P>
      <P>The insurance company has a net worth of NT$140.3 billion, exceeding 30 percent
of the total in Taiwan's overall insurance industry.</P>
      <P>Several buyers, including Taiwan's Chinatrust Financial Holding Co. Ltd., and
some Japanese and Middle East companies, had expressed interest in bidding for
Nan Shan Life if the consortium failed to secure the deal.</P>
      <P>Chinatrust had previously bid for Nan Shan when AIG, amid financial troubles,
put the unit up for sale last year.</P>

      <P>Opposition lawmakers criticized the government Tuesday over a mounting national
debt and some of its proposed spending, as the Legislative Yuan prepared to
debate the government budget for 2011.</P>
      <P>In a news conference called by the legislative caucus of the Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP), lawmaker Wong Chin-chu said that three years into its
first term the administration of President Ma Ying-jeou has run up a debt of
NT$1.42 trillion (US$44.31 billion) , compared to the NT$1.3 trillion that
existed after the DPP had been in power for eight years.</P>
      <P>Of that NT$1.3 trillion, Wong said, NT$778.8 billion was borrowed to cover
payments on debts accumulated  by the previous  KMT government, and NT$93.2
billion was used to replenish the Food Stabilization Fund.</P>
      <P>That means only NT$518.3 billion was actually used by the DPP administration,
Wong said.</P>
      <P>Another  DPP  legislator,  Huang  Wei-cher,  said  the  Ma administration has
set a record for the lowest debt service ratio and the highest rate of debt
accumulation.</P>
      <P>"The record low debt service ratio is an indication of how fast the government
is running up the national debt," he said.</P>
      <P>He suggested that a national debt meter be set up in front of the Presidential
Office to alert the public to the heavy financial burden being imposed by the
government.</P>
      <P>Wong also questioned the necessity for a publicity budget of NT$177.68 million
for the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) next year.</P>
      <P>Noting that the allocation has risen from NT$31.66 million in 2009 to NT$125.31
million in 2010 and NT$177.68 million for 2011, Wong said this represents an
amazing year-on-year growth of 295.78 percent and 41.8 percent, respectively.</P>
      <P>She questioned why the MAC needed so much money for publicity now that its major
task, the economic cooperation framework agreement with China, has been
concluded.</P>
      <P>The MAC also came under fire from Legislator Huang Wei-cher, who said the MAC is
supposed to be a watchdog of the country's cross-strait policy and should
therefore apply the brakes whenever the government tries to rush recklessly into
reconciliation with China.</P>
      <P>"The council mistakenly  sees itself as the Cultural  and Information Commission
of the Kuomintang or as China's Taiwan Affairs Office," Huang said.</P>
      <P>The government's 2011 budget will be reviewed in the legislature when the new
session opens on Sept. 24.</P>

      <P>More than a year after Typhoon Morakot struck southern Taiwan, taking hundreds
of lives, a local prosecutors office closed an investigation into the deaths
Tuesday with the conclusion that the casualties were caused by natural disaster.</P>
      <P>According to Prosecutor Wang Chun-li of the Kaohsiung District Prosecutor's
Office, the case was formally closed as no crime suspects or clear evidence of
illegal conduct was found after the year-long investigation.</P>
      <P>Wang said the prosecutors visited local residents and places devastated by the
storm to investigate whether there were any individuals or agencies suspected of
illegal conduct involved in the case.</P>
      <P>They also consulted various government departments such as the 7th River
Management Office under the Water Resources Agency, the Pingtung Forest District
Office under the Forestry Bureau, the Soil and Water Conservation Bureau, and
the Kaohsiung County government, to collect information, Wang said.</P>
      <P>An assessment team led by university professors also produced a report to assist
the investigation, he added.</P>
      <P>However, some survivors of mudslide-battered Siaolin Village in Kaohsiung County
voiced concern about the investigation.</P>
      <P>Tsai  Sung-yu,  head  of a reconstruction  and development association in the
village, said that survivors did not get enough respect  because they were not
invited  to take part in the investigation.</P>
      <P>The government should hold a briefing for these survivors to explain the
investigation report and also propose concrete measures to prevent such
disasters from happening again, he said.</P>
      <P>Typhoon Morakot slammed into Taiwan last August,  bringing powerful wind and
torrential rain that left more than 700 people dead or missing, including an
estimated 400 buried in the village of Siaolin alone.</P>

new coalition government, the top British representative in Taiwan said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The British government's position on Taiwan and China relations remains
unchanged and is in line with that of the European Union, David Campbell,
director of the British Trade and Cultural Office (BTCO) -- the U.K.'s
representative office in Taiwan in the absence of official bilateral diplomatic
ties -- said at a media briefing.</P>
      <P>Updating the media about the policy of the new government led by Conservative
Party Prime Minister David Cameron and his Liberal Democrat deputy, Nick Clegg,
Campbell said the administration "places trade and commercial interests at the
heart of its foreign policy."</P>
      <P>The coalition, which took office in May, is also tackling the biggest issue --
the scale of its deficit -- and is trying to re-balance  the economy  away from
consumption  toward saving, investment and enterprise, he said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan can play a big role in the development of low carbon economy, creative
industries, digital economy and the 2012 London Olympics, he said, adding that
Taiwan-based computer manufacturer Acer, one of the International Olympic
Committee's global partners, which will provide information technology services
for the Olympics, serves as a good example of this.</P>
      <P>The U.K. government is committed to developing a sustainable low carbon economy
with an ambitious target of getting 15 percent of its energy from renewable
sources by 2020, Campbell said. With respect to the creative industries, the
U.K. has the largest creative industry sector in the EU and many creative sub-
sectors such as architecture, design and digital media.</P>
      <P>Green energy and culture and creation are listed as two of the Taiwanese
government's "Six Key Emerging Industries, " project that includes tourism,
medicine and health care, biotechnology, and high-end agriculture, so the two
countries share similar strategies and have common ground to foster closer
collaboration and exchanges, he said.</P>
      <P>Responding to a reporter's question on whether his office has noticed a loss of
Taiwanese investors to China after the two sides signed the economic cooperation
framework agreement (ECFA) to further liberalize cross-Taiwan Strait trade,
Campbell said that while the U.K. shares the same position as the EU in
welcoming the signing of the ECFA, "it is too early to tell" what the impact of
the trade pact will be.</P>
      <P>"We would say there's good news and bad news for us. The good news is we attract
a very large portion of Taiwanese investment in the EU. The bad news is that the
percentage of Taiwan's investment in the EU is very small."</P>
      <P>Campbell said his office is trying to explain the advantages in terms of Europe
rather than just the U.K., because Taiwanese companies are not only interested
in the U.K. market of 61 million but also in the EU market of 500 million
people.</P>

    <HEADLINE>American International Group asked to keep Taiwan subsidy</HEADLINE>

      <P>The Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) asked the American International
Group, Inc. (AIG) Tuesday to keep running its Taiwan subsidy, Nan Shan Life
Insurance Co., after the Ministry of Economic Affairs nixed a bid by Hong Kong-
based Primus Financial Holdings Ltd. to acquire it.</P>
      <P>FSC Vice Chairman Wu Tang-chieh said the commission  will negotiate with AIG
with an eye to persuading the group to keep its stake in Nan Shan and run it for
the best interests of Nan Shan.</P>
      <P>"We would like to talk with AIG on any proposal it might come up with for Nan
Shan, as long as it is helpful for the insurance company's future development,"
Wu said.</P>
      <P>However, he admitted, much as the commission would like AIG to keep Nan Shan, it
cannot stop AIG from selling, as long as AIG can find a buyer suitable for the
best interests of AIG, Nan Shan, its customers and employees.</P>
      <P>Noting that Nan Shan is a significant domestic insurance company, Huang Tien-mu,
an FSC official in charge of insurance business, said his office will keep a
close eye on any transfer of Nan Shan's ownership.</P>
      <P>AIG, which received billions of dollars in a bailout from the U.S. government to
tide it over the global financial crisis in 2008, decided that same year to shed
assets worldwide to streamline its operations.</P>
      <P>It agreed to sell Nan Shan for US$2.15 billion to Primus Financial and China
Strategic Holdings on Oct. 13, 2009.</P>
      <P>However,  the deal was rejected Tuesday by the Investment Commission under the
Ministry of Economic Affairs out of concerns over the new owners' ability to
increase capital in the future and its lack of experience in life insurance.</P>
      <P>Founded in 1963, Nan Shan has some 4 million policy holders and NT$1.73
trillion-worth of gross assets, accounting for 15.32 percent of Taiwan's overall
insurance sector.</P>
      <P>The insurance company has a net assets of NT$140.3 billion, exceeding 30 percent
of the total in Taiwan's overall insurance industry.</P>

      <P>Some 4.8 million people in Taiwan -- 25.1 percent of the population -- are prone
to anxiety and anger, according to a survey conducted by the Taiwan Suicide
Prevention Center.</P>
      <P>Unemployed people were found to be the biggest group, accounting for 33 percent
of the total, followed by laborers at 31 percent and investors and business
operators at 28 percent.</P>
      <P>Liu Chia-yi, chief of the Department of Psychiatry at the Linko Chang Gung
Memorial Hospital in Taoyuan County, said anxiety and anger are forewarnings of
mental disorders, and can negatively affect people's lives and interpersonal
relationships.</P>
      <P>Chang Chia-ming, head of the Suicide Prevention Center, advised that people who
are prone to anger and anxiety should practice deep breathing, try to avoid
unpleasant situations, and think positively.</P>
      <P>The survey, which was carried by phone between July 22 and Aug. 4 among people
aged 15 and over, asked the respondents whether they were predisposed to anger
and anxiety.</P>
      <P>A total of 2,129 valid samples were collected in the poll, which had a margin of
error of plus or minus 2.1 percentage points and a confidence level of 95
percent.</P>
