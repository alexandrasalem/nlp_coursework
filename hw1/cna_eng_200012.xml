    <HEADLINE>EMOTIONAL REMARKS NOT CONDUCIVE TO BETTERING CROSS-STRAIT TIES: MAC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 1 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A ranking Mainland Affairs Council official
said Friday that the sulky, emotional remarks uttered by one of
Beijing's spokesmen Thursday toward Taiwan are by no means conducive
to bettering cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>MAC Vice Chairman Chen Ming-tung said cross-strait discrepancies
can only be resolved through patience and a rational approach, adding
that Beijing's emotional terming of the latest consensus reached by
the Republic of China President's Advisory Group on Cross-Strait
Relations as a "grotesque word game" is not helpful to improving
cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>He added that Taiwan has had a more realistic and practical
approach toward the development of cross-strait relations, saying
that Taipei's opening of direct trade, postal, and transportation
links between the ROC-controlled outlying islands of Kinmen and Matsu
and selected mainland Chinese port cities and also its granting of
permission to mainland Chinese media organizations to establish
permanent offices in Taiwan are moves conducive to strengthening ties
across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Chen again called for the Beijing authorities to return to the
negotiating table without setting preconditions in order to resume an
institutionalized negotiating mechanism across the strait so as to
jointly address the differences between the two sides.</P>
      <P>MAC Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen on Thursday expressed regret over
Beijing's response to the "three acknowledgments and four
recommendations" that were reached by the inter-party President's
Advisory Group on Cross Strait Relations.</P>
      <P>Tsai urged the Beijing authorities to pay more attention to the
proposals offered by the advisory group and exert a little more
effort in trying to find "room for maneuver" that the proposals may
have created in further developing cross-strait relations. "Ample
room is needed to make good cross-strait interactions possible," she
added.</P>
      <P>Academic Sinica President Lee Yuan-tseh, who leads the
presidential advisory group on cross-strait relations, said Beijing
made the regrettable remarks because policymakers there do not
understand Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Zhang Mingqing, spokesman of the Beijing State Council's Taiwan
Affairs Office, blasted the advisory group's proposals calling for a
steady handling of relations with mainland China as "nothing but
empty words that were grotesque."</P>

    <HEADLINE>NEW TAIPEI CAB FARES ON THE ROAD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  1  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>New cab fares in the greater Taipei area,
approximately 12.5 percent higher than before, went into effect
Friday.</P>
      <P>The first day of the implementation of the new taxi fare plan
turned out to be chaos, as about one-third of the taxies in Taipei
City did not follow the new tariff and still charged passengers at
the old rate.</P>
      <P>"Why bother to argue with passengers over the calculation of the
new fares, which are as hard as the X-Files to solve, with new meters
yet to be installed at a time when the economy is in bad shape," was
the complaint of many of the city's taxi drivers.</P>
      <P>Under the new plan, the flagfall has been formally increased to
NT$70, with the flagfall travel distance shortened from the current
1.65 km to 1.5 km.</P>
      <P>The plan, devised by the City Government Committee Supervising
Rates of Public Utilities and Transportation, also sees the distance
traveled for each meter click for each additional NT$5 shortened to
300 meters from the current 350 meters.</P>
      <P>Another NT$5 is added every two minutes when the taxi is
traveling at less than 5 km per hour, while an additional 20 percent
surcharge is tacked on between 11 p.m. and 6 a.m.</P>
      <P>City government officials called on taxi passengers to pay the
cab fares based on a fee table posted in each taxi until such time as
new meters can be installed, which will take about four months.</P>
      <P>There are about 70,000 taxies in the greater Taipei area, which
includes Taipei County, as well as Keelung City, which is located to
the northeast of Taipei.</P>
      <P>According to a survey conducted by the Ministry of Transportation
and Communications in September, Taiwan taxi drivers made a gross
average of NT$42,000 per month in 1999, for a net income of around
NT$28,000 after expenses.</P>
      <P>The gross average, however, has been considerably lower in recent
months due to a variety of factors, including the plummeting stock
market, the sagging economy and the increased number of taxi drivers
in light of a higher unemployment rate in other sectors, according to
taxi drivers.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN SHIPOWNERS COLD-SHOULDER 'MINI 3 LINKS'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  1  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>With only a month to go before the
scheduled opening of direct "mini three links" across the Taiwan
Strait, most local shipping companies are adopting a "wait-and-see"
attitude toward the new measure, shipping sources said Friday.</P>
      <P>Shipping industry executives said even the Ministry of
Transportation and Communications (MOTC) is not sure whether the
planned direct trade, mail and shipping links between Taiwan's
two frontline islands and select mainland Chinese ports, commonly
known as "mini three links", would bring fat profits to local
shipowners.</P>
      <P>The opening of "mini three links" is being planned in
accordance with the provisions of the Statute on Promoting Outlying
Islands Development, which was passed early this year under the
previous Kuomintang government.</P>
      <P>The statute was designed to help boost economic development on
Taiwan's major outlying islands of Kinmen, Matsu and Penghu. After
the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)-led government was
inaugurated in May, it continued to promote the plan and even
unilaterally announced to open the "mini three links" at the
beginning of next year.</P>
      <P>As Beijing has long closed its door to dialogue with Taiwan,
the two sides have never met to discuss the Taiwan-planned
opening of direct "mini three links" between its Kinmen/Matsu and
mainland China's Xiamen and Mawei ports in Fujian province.</P>
      <P>Although Beijing reportedly has passively agreed to allow Fujian
to open its Xiamen and Mawei ports for the Taiwan-proposed "mini
three links," many Taiwan shipping companies still feel uncertain
about the prospects of the new open-door measure.</P>
      <P>Chang Chai-hsing, president of the Taiwan Provincial Federation
of Shipping Industry Associations, said some local shipping firms
truly have made preparations for operating the new shipping routes.</P>
      <P>"Nevertheless, as far as I know, even these companies are still
adopting a wait-and-see attitude toward the new services," Chang
said, adding that the majority of local shipowners have shown
lukewarm interest in getting into the new shipping market.</P>
      <P>Chang said as Taiwan will only open Kinmen's Liaolo port and
Matsu's Fuao port for direct shipping services with Fujian's Xiamen
and Mawei ports, respectively, the ROC's large shipping companies,
such as Yangming Marine Transport Corp. and Evergreen Marine Corp.,
have little interest in the new measure.</P>
      <P>As for smaller-scale shipping firms, Chang went on, they are
worried that they may be not competitive enough to vie for new
shipping deals with their mainland counterparts following the
opening of the new Liaolo-Xiamen and Fuao-Mawei shipping routes.</P>
      <P>"Given mainland China's cheap labor, mainland shippers have
an upperhand in price war with our shipping firms after the
new shipping services open," Chang explained.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Chang said, as the ROC's Coast Guard has stepped up
inspections of ships sailing between Taiwan and its defense outposts
of Kinmen and Matsu in preparation for the opening of "mini three
links," local shippers are complaining that the new security checks
have increased their operational costs.</P>
      <P>The intensified security checks are part of the ROC's efforts to
ensure its national security and thwart any smuggling attempt after
the opening of the "mini three links," MOTC Vice Minister Ho-Chen
Tan said Friday.</P>
      <P>Ho-Chen said the ministry is scheduled to finalize a package of
measures governing the "mini three links" in the next few days and
that the Cabinet is expected to formally unveil the package on Dec.
15.</P>
      <P>Ho-Chen said once the package is promulgated, local shipping
companies can formally file applications for operating
regular, scheduled shipping services between Kinmen/Matsu and
mainland China's Xiamen and Mawei ports in Fujian province, which
lies opposite Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Ho-Chen said the MOTC has also asked prospective operators to
present their preliminary business blueprints for the ministry's
reference from Friday. The blueprints should outline the ports and
vessels to be used in their new shipping services as well as
timetables and shipping charges.</P>
      <P>According to Ho-Chen, MOTC Minister Yeh Chu-lan will make
inspection tours of Kinmen and Matsu on Dec. 11 and Dec. 13,
respectively, to review their preparations for the opening of direct
shipping links with the mainland.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  1  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A female heart patient who received rare
heart autotransplant surgery four months ago checked out of Cheng
Hsin General Hospital Friday, going home with a strong "new" heart.</P>
      <P>At a check-out press conference, the patient, a 60-year-old
housewife surnamed Chen, said "to be alive is great" and that she is
obliged to the Cheng Hsin heart surgery team led by Dr. Wei Jeng that
enabled her to lead a healthy life again.</P>
      <P>According to Wei, the director of Cheng Hsin's Heart Center, he
and his team have previously completed two such heart autotransplants
over the past two years, probably the only two cases in the world.</P>
      <P>The team performed the first successful case in November 1998 on
a 37-year-old man who suffered a ruptured left ventricle following
mitral valve replacement. He has recovered satisfactorily with two
years follow-up. The second such case was successfully completed in
early August this year.</P>
      <P>When performing autotransplant surgery, doctors first remove the
defective heart from the patient's chest, "repair" it in an operation
lasting no longer than six hours, and then put back the heart,
according to Wei.</P>
      <P>Wei began to explore the possibility of bench repair of left
ventricular rupture by autotransplant several years ago. During the
period, the two cases suffered left ventricle rupture following
mitral valve replacement and both patients were saved by the
autotransplant method.</P>
      <P>After receiving the autotransplant surgery, the heart patient is
fitted with a pacemaker to enable him or her to sustain a normal
heart beat, Wei added.</P>
      <P>According to Wei, Edinburgh surgeons reported the first such case
in 1993, but the surgery was unsuccessful.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ARTIFICIAL REEF CONSTRUCTED FOR FISHERY CONSERVATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Dec.   1   (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An artificial reef made from
10-plus discarded utility poles was sunk in waters off the northern
Taiwan port of Tamshui Friday as part of the government's fishery
resources conservation efforts.</P>
      <P>The reef was created under a cooperative program between the
Council of Agriculture's (COA's) Fishery Administration and
state-owned Taiwan Power Co. (Taipower).</P>
      <P>Fishery Administration Director Hu Hsing-hua said that under the
cooperative project, a total of 4,000 similar structures will be sunk
in the waters around Taiwan's coast over the next few years to
facilitate fishery resources conservation.</P>
      <P>"The new structures are expected to provide a foundation that is
colonized by coral polyps and in time becomes thickly encrusted with
living coral, providing an ecosystem in which marine life can
thrive," Hu explained.</P>
      <P>In view of dwindling fishery resources in Taiwan's offshore
areas, the COA has launched a campaign to use artificial reefs for
marine life and ecology conservation purposes. In the past, old
fishing vessels and cement frames have been sunk to form artificial
reefs. Earlier this month, a decommissioned warship was sunk in the
waters off the northeastern county of Ilan for the first time, to aid
in conservation measures.</P>
      <P>Hu said turning retired warships and waste cement utility poles
into reefs is even more economical than previous practices and more
meaningful in terms of waste recycling.</P>
      <P>Hu and Taipower Vice President Lai Shih-chang boarded a ship to
witness the sinking of the utility poles off Tamshui.</P>
      <P>"We hope the new artificial reef program will contribute to our
ambitious plans to rebuild marine resources in our offshore areas and
develop an offshore recreational fishing industry," Hu explained.</P>
      <P>According to Hu, Taipower has provided the COA with 20,000 waste
utility poles that will all be remodeled as artificial reefs to be
sunk in waters off Taoyuan County's Yungan, Taichung County's Wuchia,
Changhua County's Wangkung and Hualien County's Yenliao for
conservation of fishery resources and other marine life.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PICVUE HEAD OPTIMISTIC ABOUT LCD MARKET POTENTIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 1  (CNA)
(By Flor
Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Picvue Electronics Corp. President Jacob W.
B. Lin, a heavyweight in the local LCD (liquid crystal display)
industry, is optimistic about the product's market prospects and has
vowed to make his company one of Taiwan's leading high-tech
firms.</P>
      <P>In a recent interview with CNA, Lin not only talked
enthusiastically about his panoramic plans for Picvue, but also
expressed his full confidence in his LCD business.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, Picvue has also invested in a spin-off business
-- Picvue International Opto Electronics Ltd. (PIOE) -- which will
set up three furnaces in five years to produce substrates as part of
Picvue's efforts to expand its global market share of cellular phone
panels and increase its business revenues.</P>
      <P>Following is the text of Lin's exclusive interview with CNA:</P>
      <P>Q: Can you tell us about the market share currently enjoyed by
the Picvue-made LCDs in the world's personal digital assistant (PDA)
sector and disclose the company's revenue target for 2001?</P>
      <P>A: As the world's No. 1 maker of LCDs for PDA use, Picvue plans
to lift its global market share from the current level of 38 percent
to 42 percent. We have received a large order of 10 million LCDs for
PDAs from the United States-based Palm this year.</P>
      <P>Although Picvue can handle the order on its own, I don't think
that over-reliance on each other is good. I prefer to go "slowly and
stably" in upgrading production and increasing investment. Against
this backdrop, I am planning to lift Picvue's market share in PDA to
around 40 percent next year.</P>
      <P>Picvue and Palm have maintained very close business relations,
since orders from Palm contribute 55 percent of Picvue's total LCD
output, while Picvue supplies 45 percent-55 percent of Palm's demand
for LCDs.</P>
      <P>At the same time, I am also trying to seek a second production
source for Palm, such as Japan's Epson and South Korea's Samsung. I
am not worried that there will be more competitors and I firmly
believe that Picvue should grow together with its clients.</P>
      <P>In addition to Palm, Handspring is also a major source of orders
for Picvue. Currently, Picvue is the sole LCD supplier for
Handspring's PDAs and I am also looking for a second manufacturing
source for Handspring.</P>
      <P>We estimate that Picvue's business revenue will reach NT$6
billion (US$182 million) this year, up 40 percent over the 1999
level. We forecast that the figure will rise to NT$10 billion (US$304
million) for 2001, 90 percent of which will be generated by PDA-used
LCDs.</P>
      <P>Q: What is Picvue's market potential for LCM (liquid display
module) designed for cellar phones?</P>
      <P>A: Picvue manufactured about 700,000 LCMs for cellar phones each
month in the first half of this year, while its single-month
production level has been doubled to 1.5 million units at present. We
estimate that Picvue-made LCMs for mobile phones will grab 4.5
percent-5 percent of the global market in 2000 and that the
percentage will grow to 10 percent in 2001.</P>
      <P>Q: Will mainland China pose a threat to Taiwan's STN
(super-twisted liquid crystal display) industry?</P>
      <P>A: Japan is currently the world's strongest STN maker. As it is a
fast-changing and highly customized industry, neither mainland
Chinese nor South Korean manufacturers are able to meet the high
international standards of fidelity, color and contrast.</P>
      <P>Some South Korean firms, including Goldstar and Hyundai, have
withdrawn from the industry. I think mainland Chinese companies may
probably follow suit by jumping over the STN-LCD sector and directly
shifting to the TFT-LCD (thin-film transistor liquid crystal display)
sector.</P>
      <P>Q: What do you think of the local TFT-LCD industry's future and
the outlook of PIOE?</P>
      <P>A: TFT-LCD is a very good invention, which can be widely applied
in a wide range of new products, such as OLED and LCOS (liquid
crystal on silicon). I think that TFT-LCD will be fully developed in
the coming 20 or 30 years. Picvue has not yet started to manufacture
the product because of market uncertainties, but the market demand
for substrates remains quite clear.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, PIOE is scheduled to begin mass production of
substrates in the second quarter of 2002 -- when construction of its
first planned furnace is complete -- by using the overflow down-draw
technology developed by the United States based Coring Corp.</P>
      <P>PIOE has recruited many engineers from Japan, the United States,
and Germany to join forces with its own researchers in the overflow
down-draw manufacturing process. As long as the company's first
furnace is able to begin operating as scheduled, PIOE will
immediately invest in the second and the third furnaces.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SUPPORT FOR HALVING LEGISLATIVE SEATS GAINING MOMENTUM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  1 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Support for a proposal to halve the number
of seats in the Legislative Yuan was seen to be gathering momentum
Friday, with support from across the political spectrum.</P>
      <P>Kuo Su-chun of the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT), Feng
Ting-kuo of the New Party (NP), and Chou Hsi-wei of the People First
Party (PFP) said at a joint press conference that they are in favor
of the proposal first initiated by Chang Hsueh-shun of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>Chang said that he recently ran ads in the media for just one day
proposing to half the present 225 legislative seats to 113 and was
"inundated with support" from the public for the idea.</P>
      <P>Chang said that most people have a negative impression of
legislators and their poor performance and that the time is ripe for
such a proposal.</P>
      <P>Kuo noted that in the 225-seat Legislative Yuan, the number of
legislators who attend sessions regularly hovers at around 100.</P>
      <P>Feng echoed her views and added that he is in support of the
single-seat, two-votes parliamentary election system, which means
casting one vote for the candidate and one for the political party.</P>
      <P>Chou said that he will seek the consensus of the opposition
parties on the halving of the number of legislative seats.</P>
      <P>The widespread support came in the wake of a poll released by the
prestigious monthly Common Wealth which shows that the public is
pessimistic about the country's future and that up to 60 percent of
the people believe that the Legislative Yuan is the source of the
national chaos.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chang, who initiated the proposal, held a separate
press conference with his DPP colleagues in the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>He said that after the scaling-down of the Taiwan provincial
government, the number of legislators has ballooned, but the
legislature has not become a cornerstone of political stability.
Instead, he said, it has become the culprit that hinders national
progress, adding that the people are beginning to detest the
legislators for their low efficiency and shoddy performance.</P>
      <P>Chang went on to say that according to his estimates, halving the
number of legislators would save the nation up to NT$4.4 billion
(US$133.33 million). This, together with the campaign expenditure
saved would amount to NT$10 billion (US$303.03 million).</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Cho Jung-tai said that national reform has become
a more urgent priority, noting that there is only one parliamentarian
for every 250,000 people in Japan and one parliamentarian for every
150,000 people in South Korea. In comparison, there is one legislator
for every 100,000 people in Taiwan, he said.</P>
      <P>Cho claimed that if the number could be raised to one legislator
for every 200,000 people, then the quality of the Legislative Yuan
would improve.</P>
      <P>However, Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng said cutting
the number of legislators would not necessarily upgrade legislative
performance, pointing out that in the previous first and second terms
of legislators, the number of legislators only amounted to 100-plus,
although the chaos was twice as bad.</P>
      <P>Wang said that it is too early to talk about halving the number
of lawmakers, although he also acknowledged that some legislators do
sometimes give "outlandish performances" and fail to meet the
expectations of the voters.</P>
      <P>Wang also noted that the KMT, the largest opposition party that
holds sway in the legislature, has yet to discuss the idea.</P>
      <P>In addition, the proposal would involve revising the
Constitution, which he said would not be easy.</P>
      <P>DPP legislators led by Chang said they will launch a petition to
support a constitutional revision to halve the number of legislators.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CIVIL SERVANTS SAY THEY ARE 'DENIED RESPECT' BY NEW GOVERNMENT: POLL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  1  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Some civil servants have complained that
they have been denied respect under the pro-independence Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP)-led administration, according to a
qualitative study released Friday.</P>
      <P>The report was prepared by the Sun Yun-suan Cultural Foundation,
which examined the findings of two seminars held in November with the
participation of 17 staff members of central and local administrative
agencies.</P>
      <P>According to the report, the biggest source of work stress for
public functionaries currently lies in what they say is the failure
of their politically appointed superiors to respect their
professional expertise.</P>
      <P>The report said since the new DPP administration took the helm in
the Republic of China's first democratic transfer of power between
different parties in May, the phenomenon of "laymen leading
professionals" has become all too common in various government
agencies.</P>
      <P>Some civil servants were quoted as saying that several newly
appointed Cabinet ministers or department chiefs have sacrificed
professional dignity simply for short-lived partisan political gains
in policy formulation and enforcement.</P>
      <P>Many of those participating in the seminar also complained that
their superiors' disrespect and distrust of existing systems or
practices has seriously affected their morale.</P>
      <P>Worse yet, the report said, some new political appointees have
often derided them as "old bureaucrats ..." and rejected their
opinions or suggestions simply because they joined government service
before their superiors.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, civil servants working at local-level government
agencies complained that some elected local government chiefs have
often asked them to perform non-public affairs, increasing their
workload. And elected representatives' failure to abide by the law in
promoting individual people's rights or interests has made it even
more difficult to perform their duties in accordance with law, they
added.</P>
      <P>Another plight facing local-level civil servants is that their
pay scale, official duties and powers have not yet been clearly
defined since many provincial government agencies were merged
following the "marginalization" of the Taiwan Provincial Government.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, the report said that as independence, neutrality
and impartiality in the civil service is the aspiration of Taiwan's
society, political appointees of the new ROC government should
exercise more prudence and wisdom in carrying out their official
duties and should avoid prioritizing partisan interests instead of
professional requirements in policy formulation.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a public opinion survey, also conducted by the
foundation, found that the majority of the respondents feel that the
overall performance of the country's civil servants has improved in
recent years.</P>

    <HEADLINE>OFFICIAL BACKS ROC PRESIDENT'S PREDICTION ON TAIWAN STRAIT RELATIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 1 (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian's
prediction that Taipei-Beijing relations are unlikely to deteriorate
within the next year is "grounded on reasonable deductions," a top
ROC official in charge of mainland Chinese affairs said Friday.</P>
      <P>In response to Beijing's criticism that Chen's prediction
"pretends that everything is going well without regard for the
truth," Mainland Affairs Council Vice Chairman Chen Ming-tung raised
supporting claims to back the president's words.</P>
      <P>Chen said that the president's assertion has merit because
overall assessments point to three major stabilizing factors, namely
that both sides of the Taiwan Strait are focusing on their impending
accession to the World Trade Organization, that a new U.S. government
is about to be established while the mainland leadership is also
about to face a transfer of power, and that mainland China is vying
to host the 2008 Olympic Games.</P>
      <P>The global community hopes that cross-Taiwan Strait relations
will continue to develop toward stability, Chen added. Therefore, he
continued, abrupt changes in bilateral relations are unlikely to
occur in the short term.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, responding to Beijing's doubts about Taiwan's
sincerity in granting permission to mainland Chinese media
organizations to report from Taiwan on a regular basis, Chen
clarified that the rule requiring mainland Chinese journalists to
apply one month in advance of arriving in Taiwan is not set in stone
and may be handled with flexibility under "special circumstances."</P>
      <P>He went on to say that mainland journalists may leave the city
they applied to visit as long as they inform the relevant authorities
in advance "in order to ensure their safety." He did not elaborate.</P>
      <P>Along the same lines, Chen said that the journalists may change
their predetermined coverage plans as long as they inform officials
of the change in advance.</P>
      <P>Currently, two journalists of the mainland's official Xinhua News
Agency have already received ROC approval to report from Taiwan under
the new guidelines. They are expected to arrive early December.</P>

      <P>Republic of China Premier Chang Chun-hsiung
urged the United States Friday to address squarely the growing
imbalance of military might on either side of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The premier made the remarks when he received Floyd D. Spencer,

Representatives.</P>
      <P>Chang said that mainland China has continued to modernize its
armed forces in recent years and that there is an imbalance in the
military might on either side of the Taiwan Strait, posing a threat
to Taiwan's security.</P>
      <P>He urged the United States to continue to provide Taiwan with
defensive weapons in accordance with the Taiwan Relations Act and to
step up cooperation and exchanges with Taiwan's military.</P>
      <P>The premier said that economic development is the lifeline of the
nation and that the premise of sustained economic development is a
stable political situation. The nucleus of such political stability,
he continued, lies in cross-strait stability.</P>
      <P>The easing of tensions in the Taiwan Strait and the maintenance
of cross-strait stability is the goal of the government, he went on,
adding that the government is sincere in its desire to conduct
dialogue and exchanges with the other side of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>He also expressed the hope that the United States will support
Taiwan's bids for observer status in international organizations,
saying that if Taiwan can join more such organizations, it would be

    <HEADLINE>POLL FINDS PESSIMISM PREVAILING AMONG HIGH-TECH EXECUTIVES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  1 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>More than half of local high-tech industry
executives responding to a recent opinion poll have expressed
pessimism about Taiwan's future, the Global View monthly magazine
said Friday.</P>
      <P>The magazine conducted a telephone survey of senior executives
of the top 200 technology firms listed on the over-the-counter (OTC)
stock market from Nov. 10-14 with a view to exploring their opinions
about the new Democratic Progressive Party-led administration's
overall performance. A total of 66 valid replies were collected.</P>
      <P>Poll results show that 53 percent of the respondents are not
optimistic about Taiwan's future prospects.</P>
      <P>Asked whether their companies would continue to make
investments in Taiwan, 55.4 percent gave a negative answer and
only 18.2 percent said "Yes."</P>
      <P>According to the poll, 56.9 percent said they are dissatisfied
with President Chen Shui-bian's performance since his taking office
in May; only 10.9 percent said they are content with Chen's
performance; and 30.8 percent gave a "so-so" evaluation of his
administrative record.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, only 15.2 percent threw support behind an
opposition-initiated campaign to oust Chen over his administration's
abrupt decision to abort a partially built nuclear power plant,
while 59.1 percent gave a thumbs-down to the "recall" drive.</P>
      <P>As much as 65.2 percent also voiced opposition to the
opposition-dominated legislature's plan to boycott the DPP
administration's budget plan for fiscal 2001, and only 12.1 percent
backed such a move. The DPP controls barely one-third of seats in
the 225-member parliament.</P>
      <P>The poll also found that Taiwan indeed faces a threat of a
possible exodus of high-tech firms as 56.1 percent of the
respondents said their companies plan to increase overseas
investments to cope with a lingering domestic economic slowdown,
while 25.8 percent said they plan to cut domestic investments in
the face of sluggish business activities.</P>
      <P>Among those intending to make outbound investments, 69.7 percent
said they plan to launch their new investment projects in
mainland China; Southeast Asia and the United States tie at
second place, with 15.2 percent choosing either of them as favorite
investment destinations.</P>
      <P>Nearly 90 percent want the DPP administration to articulate its
policy on high-tech industry development because public policy
uncertainty has made many local firms adopt a "wait-and-see"
attitude, according to the survey.</P>
      <P>The three top elements cited by the respondents as factors
affecting their business expansion plans for the 2000-2001 period
were dwindling market demand triggered by an economic slowdown,
flip-flops in the new government's policy formulation and
enforcement, and lower-than-expected profitability of global
high-tech stocks, in descending order.</P>
      <P>Among measures planned by the new government, the
scheduled opening of direct "mini three links" between Taiwan's
outlying islands of Kinmen/Matsu and mainland China's Xiamen/Mawei
ports received most praise, while the decision to abort the fourth
nuclear power plant was the least unpopular.</P>
      <P>While 42.4 percent support government invention in stock market
operations to prop up stock prices, 25.7 percent said the government
should adopt a hands-off policy so that the stock market can
exactly reflects domestic economic fundamentals.</P>

months because of corruption and mismanagement. The Chinese
authorities have sent 80 anti-riot police to maintain order at the

    <HEADLINE>KMT MEMBERS HIT 600,000 AFTER RE-REGISTRATION DRIVE</HEADLINE>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Kuomintang (KMT), Taiwan's largest
political party, has reported that three months into its
re-registration drive, the party's membership has topped 600,000.</P>
      <P>Chao Shou-po, director general of the KMT's Organizational
Development Committee, said that the members who re-registered
reached 550,000, while another 59,000 new members have joined the
party.</P>
      <P>Chao said he was elated to learn of the large amount of "new
blood" that has joined the KMT, saying that half of them are
youngsters and women, exactly the groups that the KMT is actively
targeting.</P>
      <P>He said that in the next two months, the KMT will focus on
soliciting new party members, adding that it will print a pamphlet to
recruit more people into its camp.</P>
      <P>The KMT, which used to boast of two million members, began the
re-registered campaign in September after suffering a humiliating
defeat in the March presidential election, in which its candidate
finished a distant third. KMT officials explained that the
re-registration drive was an effort to consolidate the party's
support.</P>
      <P>On whether former Premier Tang Fei, former KMT Secretary General
Huang Kun-huei, and Huang Hwei-chen, former KMT spokesman, have
re-registered, Chao said that he believes that Tang, who had openly
said that he would re-register, will honor his words, while the two
Huangs have also said they would re-register.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the 14 KMT members that have joined the Cabinet
headed by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party have re-registered,
Chao only said that quite a few have done so. He added that in order
to shield them from possible trouble, he could not divulge their
names.</P>

(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Democratic Progressive Party Chairman
Lin I-hsiung received the Peace Award Friday from the Taipei branch
of Rotary International for his lifelong pursuit of peace and a
better future for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lin, who was chosen from among four other candidates, received
the award from writer Liu Hsia, who praised him for his dedication to
harmony among different ethnic groups in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lin, who served as chairman of the DPP until the party took power
in Taiwan in May, chose to step down when his political career was at
its peak. At the time, Lin said he was choosing "the road less
traveled by" and returning to social work with less of a halo.</P>
      <P>The lawyer-turned-politician, who has pursued social justice as
his lifelong goal, was once jailed for protesting against the
Kuomintang government's oppression of an opposition magazine, and
suffered great pain when his twin daughters and mother were murdered
20 years ago, a crime which has never been solved.</P>
      <P>Lin was not defeated by all of his suffering, and continued to
work hard for the future of Taiwan, Liu pointed out.</P>
      <P>Lin said that the driving force that has kept him doing all these
things for Taiwan was love, adding that he hopes his award will be an
inspiration to all the people who pursue peace with love.</P>
      <P>The judges said they gave the award to Lin because the majority
of his life has been dedicated to cultivating the "values of love and
forgiveness."</P>

    <HEADLINE>SURVEY: MOST TAIWAN FIRMS DISAPPROVE OF ADMINISTRATION'S PERFORMANCE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 1 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>More than half of Taiwan technological firms
disapprove of the performance of President Chen Shui-bian's
six-month-old administration, according to a survey released on
Friday.</P>
      <P>The poll, conducted by the mass-circulated monthly "Global
Views," also found that the slowdown of the island's economy and the
uncertainty around the government's policies are the two major
factors holding sway over local firms' investment plans for the next
two years.</P>
      <P>More than half of those interviewed said the government's
policies influenced, often negatively, their operations. As a result,
more than 60 percent said they were increasing their investments in
mainland China.</P>
      <P>Although more than half of them said they were "not optimistic"
about the island's economic and political prospects, and 56 percent
said they were displeased with Chen's on-the-job performance.
However, more than 60 percent of those interviewed opposed the idea
of removing Chen through a legislative recall.</P>
      <P>More than half of the respondents said they do not see a bright
future for their investments in Taiwan, and more than 90 percent
favor the establishment of direct trade and shipping links with
mainland China, as well as a clear-cut government policy of
encouraging the development of high-tech industries.</P>
      <P>As to the government's top tasks, most of them named the direct
trade and shipping links with mainland China and providing ample
sources of electricity and water as the nation's top priorities.</P>
      <P>As expected, the government's abolishment of the island's nuclear
plant was disapproved of by most of the respondents, because
sufficient electricity is vital to their future development,
according to the survey.</P>
      <P>However, the respondents have no preference for nuclear power.
Instead, 59 percent of the surveyed said they will settle for any
kind of electricity, as long as it fulfills their needs.</P>
      <P>The surveyed firms were split on whether the government should
intervene to prop up the plummeting stock market, with 42.4 percent
putting the market nose-dive down to non-economic factors that need
government actions to reverse; while 25.7 percent of them were
against government intervention, saying a hands-off approach is the
best policy.</P>
      <P>Noting that the stock market failed to respond to the
government's all-out efforts to boost it, some respondents said the
bungled attempt has backfired and compromised the government's
credibility.</P>
      <P>Although the government should not be held solely responsible for
the island's receding industries, the blame for failing to better the
island's infrastructure should be laid squarely on the government,
said many interviewees.</P>
      <P>One interviewee complained about the labor shortage resulting
from the government's policy to reduce the number of foreign laborers
in the wake of surging numbers of unemployed domestic workers.</P>
      <P>Others criticized the government's decision to limit the kinds of
high-tech industry that qualify for tax breaks from 450 to 150.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted between Nov. 10-14 among the top 200
high-tech firms on the island, with valid responses from 66 of them.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CURRENT CROSS STRAIT SITUATION MAY CHANGE IN ONE YEAR: LEE KUAN YEW</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  Dec.  1  (CNA)
(By Edward Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Singapore Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew
has said that the current cross strait situation will not continue
for another year.</P>
      <P>Lee said that if mainland China permits the present situation to
continue, it would be giving Republic of China President Chen
Shui-bian a chance to deny Beijing's "one China" policy.</P>
      <P>Lee made the remarks last Saturday in an exclusive interview with
the Hong Kong-based satellite TV channel.</P>
      <P>Lee said he believes that President Chen Shui-bian will further
promote Taiwan's position in the international community and offer
economic assistance to poor countries so as to obtain their
diplomatic recognition and support, but mainland China's growing
economic power will eventually defeat Taiwan in the diplomatic arena.</P>
      <P>Asked about whether Taiwan will relax its "no hurry, be patient"
policy restricting investment in mainland China after Beijing gains
entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO), Lee said that Taiwan
is already prepared to abandon that policy, and is only awaiting an
ease in cross-strait tensions.</P>
      <P>All of the enterprises in Taiwan hope that the government will
relax the policy as soon as possible, so as to enable them to make
meaningful investments in mainland China, Lee said.</P>
      <P>If the policy is not changed, Taiwan businessmen should invest in
mainland China through third countries such as the United States,
Hong Kong and Japan, Lee suggested. He added that investment in
mainland China will have complementary benefits for economic entities
across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Taiwan investors have chosen mainland China of the familiar
customs and language in that country, not to mention lower costs of
labor, electricity and water, Lee noted.</P>
      <P>Lee also forecasted that the economy of Taiwan will not crash,
but still needs to be watched for a while. Although Taiwan's stock
index and real estate prices have declined, and domestic banks are
holding huge amounts of opverdue loans, the situation is
not as bad as expected, Lee said. He added that the situation will
make a turn for the better when cross-strait relations have settled.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the new U.S. president will change U.S. policy on
the Taiwan Strait issue, Lee said that no matter who becomes the next
U.S. president, that nation's "China policy" will remain unchanged.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NO CHANGE TO OPEN-DOOR POLICY TO MAINLAND TOURIST: MAC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  1 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China government has never
wavered in its decision to allow mainland Chinese people to make
sightseeing tours of Taiwan starting in June 2001, a senior official
in charge of mainland affairs said Friday.</P>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Vice Chairman Chen Ming-tung said
the government decided to open doors to mainland Chinese tourists
from mid-2001 when former Premier Tang Fei was still in office.</P>
      <P>"And incumbent Premier Chang Chun-hsiung has announced guiding
principles for relevant government agencies to work out detailed
regulations to govern sightseeing visits by mainland people," Chen
said, adding that the principles include "limited number" and "group
in and group out."</P>
      <P>Chen said the new opening measure needs many accompanying rules
to ensure national security and social stability. As for the number
of mainland tourists to be allowed in, Chen went on, the government
will make a decision after completing a further review of various
social and economic control measures.</P>
      <P>Currently, mainland Chinese are restricted to visiting relatives
on the island or for cultural and educational exchanges. Applications
are scrutinized on a case-by-case basis.</P>
      <P>As both Taiwan and mainland China are expected to join the World
Trade Organization (WTO) early next year, Chen said the climate for
cross-Taiwan Strait engagement will change by then.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, Chen said, the MAC is scheduled to
refer to the Cabinet early next year a blueprint for opening direct
cross-strait trade, mail and transport links, also known as "major
three links."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Han Kun, deputy director of the National Security
Bureau (NSB), the government has completed all necessary preparations
and security deployment in connection with the imminent opening of
direct "mini three links" between Taiwan's frontline islands of
Kinmen and Matsu and mainland China's Xiamen and Mawei ports.</P>
      <P>Han said all security personnel and some large-scale security
check facilities will be stationed or installed at Kinmen's Liaolo
port and Matsu's Fuao port by Dec. 15 in preparations for opening
the "mini three links" on Jan. 1 as scheduled.</P>
      <P>Han said the NSB has also long been studying security
measures in anticipation of the opening of direct cross-strait "mini
three links" and "major three links" as well as the entry of mainland
tourists and the posting of mainland journalists for news coverage.
"We have completed all necessary preparations to ensure our national
security," he added.</P>
      <P>Official tallies show that mainland Chinese have made about
540,000 trips to Taiwan since rapprochement began in 1988.</P>
      <P>The new liberalization measures are part of efforts by Taipei to
assuage and reconcile Beijing, which is still deeply suspicious of
ROC President Chen Shui-bian's pro-independence past and has
threatened to invade if the island declared statehood.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC PRESIDENT APPLAUDS ADVISORY BODY'S RECOMMENDATIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  1  (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Friday that
his new administration will use the "three acknowledgments and four
recommendations" of an advisory body on Taipei-Beijing relations as
reference for the formation of its mainland China policy.</P>
      <P>Chen explained to four visiting U.S. congressmen that the
Republic of China's mainland policy is based on his May 20
inauguration speech, but that he invited Academia Sinica President
Lee Yuan-tseh to head the President's Advisory Group on Cross-Taiwan
Strait Relations in order to fine-tune that policy.</P>
      <P>He openly praised the advisory group for being able to reach a
consensus Sunday after seven meetings and many compromises, and he
thanked the efforts of the 20-some members, who come from diverse
political and academic backgrounds. "It marked a good beginning," he
added.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's first democratic transfer of political power took place
only this year, over 200 years later than the United States, where
Chen said it is already "a part of life." Being a "brand new start"
for Taiwan, he added that the new administration would "unavoidably"
face many difficulties.</P>
      <P>However, Chen told Floyd D. Spence (R-SC), chairman of the U.S.
House of Representatives Committee on Armed Services, that he is
confident that he can improve relations with Beijing and achieve a
breakthrough so as to normalize cross-strait relations. He added that
he is certain Taiwan can overcome the current political turmoil to
focus on economic development.</P>
      <P>Chen congratulated the four congressmen on their successful
re-election to office and thanked them for their support of pro-ROC
bills in the U.S. House of Representatives. He urged them to continue
supporting the Republic of China, and added that the two countries
share common interests in the Asia Pacific region and in maintaining
security in the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Spence, accompanied by U.S. Representatives Solomon Ortiz (D-TX),
Richard M. Burr (R-NC), and Silvestre Reyes (D-TX), told Chen that no
matter which candidate eventually wins the U.S. presidential
election, the U.S. government will continue to give the Republic of
China all the necessary support and assistance.</P>
      <P>Heading a 16-member delegation, Spence arrived in Taipei Thursday
for a three-day visit, his fifth to Taiwan. This is the last leg of
his group's current Asian tour, aimed at gleaning first-hand
understanding of the latest regional developments. The delegation
visited South Korea, Singapore, and Thailand before coming to Taiwan.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China has stepped up espionage
against Taiwan, posing increasing threats to the Republic of China's
national security, a senior security officer said Friday.</P>
      <P>Han Kun, deputy director of the National Security Bureau,
told a seminar at the military-run Fushingkang College that mainland
Chinese spies have been endeavoring to infiltrate Taiwan's
businesses, government and armed forces.</P>
      <P>Han said since the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) took the ROC's presidency in the island's first democratic
transfer of power in May, mainland China has worked out new measures
to cope with Taiwan's new political circumstances.</P>
      <P>For one thing, Han said, mainland China has changed its
previous policy of "no contacts" with the DPP after the
pro-independence party came to power. Beijing has since working to
forge ties with influential DPP heavyweights.</P>
      <P>In anticipation of possible frequent transfer of power
between different political parties in democratic Taiwan, Han
said, mainland China has decided to prioritize high-level
contacts with ruling party heavyweights.</P>
      <P>In addition, Han said, mainland China will also used every
possible channel and means to cultivate pro-Beijing elements
in all major opposition parties.</P>
      <P>Han went on to say that every year, more than 3,000 mainland
intelligence officers visit Taiwan under disguised identities.
"During their visits, our security officers have consistently
kept close monitoring of their activities here," he noted.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Han said some 2,000 illegal mainland immigrants
remain unaccountable, posing a potential threat to Taiwan's
security.</P>
      <P>Since Taiwan relaxed restrictions on travel by mainlanders to the
island in 1988, mainland people have made 540,000 visits to
Taiwan, Han said.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  1  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Central Bank of China (CBC) urged the
public Friday to have confidence in the New Taiwan dollar, amid
widespread expectation that the currency may slide further.</P>
      <P>Chou A-ting, director general of the CBC'c Foreign Exchange
Department, said that the worst pressure on the NT dollar has passed.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks to counter public expectations that the local
currency will continue sliding. Fears about the NT dollar's stability
have triggered frenzied buying of foreign currencies, which in turn
have driven the Taiwan dollar down even further.</P>
      <P>The New Taiwan dollar closed at 33.036 to the greenback on
Taipei's foreign exchange market Friday, up NT$0.010 from
Thursday. Dealers attributed the week's first day of NT dollar
appreciation to general weakness in the U.S. dollar and CBC
intervention.</P>
      <P>Local media had reported that foreign exchange banks have
predicted that outstanding foreign currency deposits in major
financial institutions in Taiwan will prove to have hit NT$1.1
trillion as of the end of November, which would set a record high.</P>
      <P>But Chou said that the media reports on foreign exchange deposits
may be exaggerated.</P>
      <P>He cautioned those who have U.S. dollar deposits to be careful
about the risk of exchange rate fluctuations, so as to avoid losses.
The media should also refrain from exaggerating the currency
situation so as not to add fuel to the flames.</P>
      <P>On the possible prospects for the U.S. dollar, he said that
though the greenback is still strong, economic growth in the U.S. has
eased, and whether the U.S. dollar can maintain its momentum is in
question.</P>
      <P>In addition, if the U.S. dollar loses steam, it will effect the
flows of U.S. capital to Asia and Europe, he said, adding that this
situation also needs further observation.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A 60-year-old Chinese-born Canadian
citizen, who is a Falun Gong practitioner, has been sentenced to
three years in an "education through labor" camp in mainland China
without trial, a human rights group said here Friday.</P>
      <P>The Falun Gong practitioner, Zhang Kunlun, emigrated to Canada
in 1989, and became a citizen of that country in 1995. He went to
China on Chinese passport in 1996 in order to teach sculpture in a
university, the Hong Kong-based Information Center for Human Rights
and Democracy said.</P>
      <P>The information center said Zhang's sentence is an indication
that China is getting tough with Falun Gong practitioners living in
foreign countries. Teng Chunyan, a Chinese-born American resident
who is also a practitioner of Falun Gong, was put on trial in
Beijing on Nov. 23.</P>
      <P>The center also said Friday that two more Falun Gong
practitioners died recently while in police custody. They were Meng
Qingxi, 42, of Weifang county in eastern Shandong province, and Kung
Qinghuang, 33, of Jiansui county in southern Yunan province.</P>
      <P>Their deaths brought the number of Falun Gong practitioners who
died in police custody in China to at least 72, it added. China
outlawed Falun Gong and began to crack down on the spiritual sect in

    <TEXT>
      <P>As exchanges between Taiwan and mainland
China become closer, "security of troops" in Taiwan is increasing in
importance, said Minister of National Defense Wu Shih-wen Friday.</P>
      <P>Claiming that a "war without shooting" is already underway
between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, Wu warned attendees at a
Taipei symposium on "security of troops" that Beijing is approaching
Taiwan with a two-pronged policy -- disarming the public by making
the gesture of reaching out, while reserving military force as the
last resort to bring the island under its domination.</P>
      <P>Wu said that the security of the military is the focus of any
war, and should not be ignored either at the frontline or at the rear
-- either in peacetime or war.</P>
      <P>He stressed that the military is the cornerstone of national
security amid Taiwan's power transition, which has been fraught with
political and economic turmoil, as well as the presence of Beijing's
persistent military threat.</P>
      <P>Wu said Beijing has stepped up its pressure on Taiwan by giving
military leaders a leading role in shaping its policy toward Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Citing examples to support his claims, Wu said that Gen. Zhang
Wannian, vice chairman of Beijing's Central Military Commission, now
doubles as the deputy head of the Central Leading Group for Taiwan
Affairs; and Major General Wang Zaixi has been appointed as deputy
director of the Taiwan Affairs Office under the mainland's State
Council.</P>
      <P>Beijing has also warned through the mass media in Hong Kong that
a war with Taiwan is inevitable within five years, said Wu, who
reiterated the ROC armed forces' long-standing stance of "preparing
for, but not provoking war."</P>
      <P>The rapid economic and political changes on the island have also
compromised the security of its troops by exposing soldiers to
various political points of view, said the defense head.</P>
      <P>He urged the symposium to raise the public's awareness about the
security of the military, and the help promote the safety of the
nation's soldiers.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN'S SECURITY ESSENTIAL TO ASIA'S STABILITY: U.S. CONGRESSMAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 2 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's security is essential to stability
in Asia and is also in the national interest of the United States,
said visiting U.S. Congressman Floyd D. Spencer (R-SC) Saturday.</P>
      <P>Spencer, chairman of the House of Representatives Committee on
Armed Services, said that after exchanging views with senior leaders
in Taiwan over the past two days, he is now further convinced of the
critical importance of maintaining peace and stability in East Asia
and of moving toward a peaceful resolution of the future of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Spencer, heading a 16-member U.S. delegation including four
congressmen, arrived in Taipei Thursday for a three-day visit. The
group is here to see for themselves the latest situation in Taiwan
politics, as well as the island's defense requirements.</P>
      <P>In his departure statement, Spencer said he is pleased to see
that democracy in Taiwan is continuing to develop and is becoming an
increasingly powerful influence in the region.</P>
      <P>"Now more than ever, supporting democracy in East Asia remains a
priority for the United States. As such, any change in Taiwan's
status should come only with the consent of the people of Taiwan,"
Spencer stressed.</P>
      <P>He expressed his gratitude to the people of Taiwan for the
extraordinary display of hospitality they extended to his delegation,
and said he believes that the visit had strengthened the
long-standing bonds of friendship between the United States and
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>During his stay in Taiwan, Spencer met with Premier Chang
Chun-hsiung, who took the opportunity to urge the United States to
address squarely the growing imbalance of military might across the
Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Chang urged Washington to continue providing Taiwan with
defensive weapons, as mainland China has continued to modernize its
armed forces in recent years. The premier stressed that the growing
imbalance in military power across the strait poses an evident threat
to Taiwan's security.</P>
      <P>On another occasion, Spencer met with ROC Defense Minister Wu
Shih-wen. They exchanged views on the sales of U.S.-made defensive
weapons and military equipment to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Spencer reportedly assured Wu that he attaches great importance
to Taiwan's security needs and supports Taiwan's acquisition of
adequate defensive weapons to safeguard its national security and
stability.</P>
      <P>This marked Spencer's fifth visit to Taiwan since 1971.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SENIOR BANKER PITCHES FOR OPENING DOOR TO MAINLAND CAPITAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 2 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Central Bank of China (CBC) Deputy Governor
Chen Shih-meng proposed Saturday that Taiwan open its doors to
mainland Chinese capital under appropriate regulations.</P>
      <P>Chen said he is convinced that the "open-door" measure can help
allay misgivings that ongoing mainland China-bound investment fever
may hallow out Taiwan's economic clout.</P>
      <P>The economics professor-turned-banker offered the recommendation
after attending a seminar on how to help local industries secure
adequate capital to finance their business operations and expansion.
The seminar was jointly organized by the CBC and the Ministry of
Finance.</P>
      <P>Chen pointed out that the government can impose different
ceilings for mainland investments in different local industries based
on their distinctive features and requirements.</P>
      <P>Taiwan currently still bans entry of mainland capital. But
actually, some mainland China-based companies are believed to
have remitted money into Taiwan for various investment projects via
third places under disguised corporate identities.</P>
      <P>Chen said if Taiwan legally opens doors to mainland capital
under well-designed regulations, such "undercover" practices can be
eradicated and some of local industries may also be given a boost.</P>
      <P>As for the mainland-bound investment mania, Chen said relevant
government agencies should endeavor to improve the general domestic
business climate in addition to offering incentives to attract local
companies to retain their business roots at home.</P>
      <P>The outspoken former Taipei mayor further said Taiwanese
investment in mainland China does not just involve issues of
capital outflow.</P>
      <P>"The most serious problem lies in mainland China's hostility
toward Taiwan. With so many Taiwan-owned companies on the mainland,
we fret that Beijing may one day pressure Taiwanese business
people with interests on the mainland to force our government to
yield to its negotiation terms," Chen noted.</P>
      <P>The current Democratic Progressive Party-led government is
facing pressure from local industry executives to scrap the "no
haste, be patient" mainland investment policy, adopted by the
previous Kuomintang government, to allow them greater freedom to
invest on the mainland to sharpen their competitive edge in the global
market.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council, which charts
Taiwan's policy toward mainland China, is now reviewing the "no
haste" policy and expected to announce further relaxed mainland
investment regulations before the end of this year.</P>
      <P>Under its "no haste" policy, Taiwan imposes an investment ceiling
of US$50 million per project and bans businesses from investing in
certain strategic industries there due to national security
considerations.</P>
      <P>Attracted by cheap land and labor as well as a common language
and culture, Taiwan investors have poured an estimated US$40 billion
into the mainland over the past decade. Funds were funneled
into the mainland through Hong Kong or a third country.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KAOHSIUNG SEEKS TO BECOME GATEWAY TO TAIWAN FOR MAINLAND TOURISTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  Dec.  2  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>With the Republic of China government
talking about opening Taiwan to tourists from mainland China, the
southern port city of Kaohsiung is actively seeking to become the
gateway to Taiwan for such mainland visitors.</P>
      <P>After years of discussion, the ROC government decided recently
that tourists from mainland China will be allowed to enter Taiwan
beginning next June for leisure and sightseeing trips.</P>
      <P>The decision has prompted people in Kaohsiung's tourism industry
to accelerate moves to grab as large a slice of the potentially
lucrative tourism pie expected with the arrival of holiday makers
from the mainland.</P>
      <P>In a meeting with officials from the Kaohsiung City Government,
local tourism industry representatives appealed for administrative
assistance from the government to help them clench the opportunity to
revive sagging tourism in the southern city.</P>
      <P>The representatives said Kaohsiung should be made the gateway to
Taiwan for mainland Chinese tourists, as the port city is the leading
industrial and business city in southern Taiwan, as well as a
transportation center with an international airport and a harbor that
boasts the world's third largest container handling capacity.</P>
      <P>In addition, they said, hotel accommodations and other expenses
are much lower than the northern city of Taipei, the island's
capital.</P>
      <P>Lee Wen-liang, director of Kaohsiung City's Development Bureau,
urged Kaohsiung Mayor Frank Hsieh to render support to the city's
tourism industry.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, meeting participants also suggested that Kaohsiung
strive to become the key Taiwan seaport in conducting direct
transportation links with mainland China once the so-called "Big
three direct links" between Taiwan and mainland China are opened,
which will likely happen in June next year at the earliest.</P>
      <P>Concurring with the representatives, Hsieh said he will do his
utmost to help realize their expectations and turn Kaohsiung into a
gateway to Taiwan for mainland Chinese tourists.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  2  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>U.S. Treasury Department officials in
charge of Asia-Pacific affairs are scheduled to visit Taipei next
week to gain a better understanding of the tendency of the New
Taiwan (NT) dollar's exchange rate against the greenback.</P>
      <P>Chou A-ting, director-general of the Central Bank of China's
(CBC's) Foreign Exchange Department, said Saturday that the treasury
officials' travel plan signifies U.S. concern about the recent
depreciation streak of major Asian currencies against the U.S.
dollar.</P>
      <P>Because of an economic slowdown, the South Korean currency
has depreciated to 1,208 won against one U.S. dollar, and the
Japanese yen has remained weak in recent months due to economic woes
and domestic political fray. Similar economic and political
uncertainty has also driven down the NT dollar's exchange rate
against the greenback to its four-year low this week.</P>
      <P>Chou said all these developments have alarmed the U.S. Treasury
Department and prompted it to decide to send its officials to
Asia-Pacific countries for fact-finding visits.</P>
      <P>When U.S. treasury officials arrive in Taiwan next week, Chou
said he will brief them on Taiwan's hope that the central banks of
all relevant Asia-Pacific countries cooperate closely to maintain
regional currency and financial market stability.</P>
      <P>Commenting on speculation that the recent depreciation of the
Korean won could be attributed to the NT dollar's downward streak,
Chou said some people might think that currency devaluation could
help stimulate exports.</P>
      <P>However, Chou stressed that the CBC has no intention of
manipulating the currency exchange rate as a monetary policy tool to
boost exports. He also reaffirmed the CBC's willingness to pool
wisdom and expertise with its counterparts in other Asia-Pacific
countries to help maintain currency market stability.</P>
      <P>The NT dollar closed at 32.995 against the greenback Saturday,
rising NT$0.041 from Friday's level.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 2 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Kuomintang legislator warned Saturday that
a "household" financial meltdown may hit Taiwan's families before the
arrival of the Lunar New Year, posing yet another threat to the
country's sagging economy.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Pan Wei-kang on Saturday urged the government to
pay attention to factors that might contribute to a household
financial crisis.</P>
      <P>Pan said financial strain caused by the recent plummeting stock
market has endangered all sectors of Taiwan society, including
families. With the approach of the Lunar New Year, she added, company
managers are obliged to have year-end bonuses ready, while borrowers
are forced to clear their debts.</P>
      <P>Quoting a recent online public opinion poll, Pan said two-thirds
of those surveyed reported stock market losses over the past several
months, 13.3 percent became debtors, and 6.5 percent said the
slumping stock market had become a source of family quarrels and
disputes.</P>
      <P>In addition, she said, 22.6 percent of the respondents said they
had lost all of their savings because of the plummeting stock market,
while 31.3 percent said their fortunes had been substantially
reduced.</P>
      <P>According to results of the survey, the average wealth of each
citizen dropped approximately NT$230,000 during the period, so the
fortune meltdown for a four-member family would reach almost NT$1
million.</P>
      <P>Average family savings were also dragged down by 22.64 percent
over the past several months, Pan quoted the survey as indicating.</P>
      <P>Pan warned that a household financial meltdown is threatening to
undermine the nation's family morale and harmony, and is jeopardizing
the careers and academic performances of family members.</P>

    <HEADLINE>VP DEMANDS APOLOGY FROM LOCAL NEWSMAGAZINE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  2  (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Vice President Annette
Lu's legal team announced Saturday that it will seek legal sanctions
against a local magazine on her behalf if the magazine does not issue
a public apology for accusing her of being a seditious rumormonger.</P>
      <P>Lu herself was absent from the press conference, but she told
reporters at the inauguration of a technology park in Taoyuan County
that because she is the nation's deputy head of state, she does not
wish to take legal actions unless absolutely necessary. However, she
demanded a public apology from The Journalist newsmagazine.</P>
      <P>Lu's six-member legal team and 13 legal advisers -- including her
elder brother Lu Chuan-sheng, a practicing attorney -- declared that
a careful examination of her residential telephone logs from Nov.
1-12 showed the vice president did not call up members of the media
on Nov. 3 after 7 p.m. or at any other time to spread rumors about an
alleged extramarital affair between President Chen Shui-bian and one
of his female aides.</P>
      <P>In its Nov. 16 issue, the magazine accused her of contacting a
"senior media person" to spread such rumors.</P>
      <P>Of the three phone calls Lu made after 7 p.m. during that period
to members of the media, Lu's lawyers said that all three journalists
have told them that none of the calls involved the alleged scandal.</P>
      <P>President Chen had said in a Nov. 16 press release that he "has
absolute faith in the vice president" and does not think that she is
the source of the rumors.</P>
      <P>Lu's legal team described The Journalist's reporting as
"obviously false and malicious." Therefore, it continued, the
magazine has until Dec. 10 to publish a half-spread front-page
apology approved by Lu's lawyers in six newspapers, and also make
public the full text of the apology via six television stations.</P>
      <P>The lawyers added that The Journalist should also conduct a full
investigation into the related "acts of negligence" by its reporters,
writers, and editors and "deal out severe punishments" to show the
news media's "sincerity in carrying out self-regulation and
self-reflection."</P>
      <P>The team accused the magazine of showing "actual malice" by
claiming "without the slightest evidence" that Lu wanted to use the
alleged presidential scandal to "finish off" the president and "flow
with the momentum to scale new heights."</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the lawyers continued, The Journalist's cover used a
"libelous" headline without providing enough supporting proof to show
that the claim was reasonable, thereby "seriously violating
professional journalistic ethics" and again satisfying the definition
of malice.</P>
      <P>The headline read: "The one who stirred up the scandal and is
secretly competing with the president unexpectedly turned out to be
Annette Lu."</P>
      <P>The team also alleged that a reporter from the magazine tried to
encourage and induce the First Lady in a "pre-arranged trap" during
an interview to articulate statements that would have been
"unfavorable" to the vice president.</P>
      <P>Despite repeated denials and clear warnings from the vice
president's spokeswoman and a statement from the First Lady that she
disagreed with the contents of the interview, The Journalist went
ahead to publish and "exaggerate" the story in another "apparent
manifestation" of malice, the lawyers said.</P>
      <P>Regarding the litigation expenses that may be incurred,
Presidential Deputy Secretary-General Eugene Chien said that they
will be paid from various donations, and not from the Presidential
Office.</P>

using weight-cutting equipment, in that order.</P>
      <P>Although agreeing that exercise is the most effective way of
losing weight, some 30 percent of the overweight respondents said
they chose to take pills or traditional medicine to lose weight as a
more convenient method, said pollsters from the university.</P>
      <P>Some 24 percent of the respondents said they simply go to
out-patient departments of general hospitals to seek medical help in
losing weight, while some 30 percent said they opted for health foods
and traditional medicines to cut down their weight.</P>
      <P>The survey polled 1,031 overweight people who sought help in the
TMU Family Medical Department and Weight-losing Department. It found
that most of them became overweight because they could not resist the
attraction of eating or because they did not know what made them fat.</P>
      <P>According to Dr. Liao Chun-kai, chief physician at the TMU Family
Medical Department, male patients are on average more satisfied and
comfortable with their weight-loss results than female patients. He
noted that men show greater confidence in themselves and in their
physical prowess after losing weight.</P>
      <P>Liao said effective weight-loss also helps improve the sex lives
of married couples, adding that one-fourth of those surveyed said
their marriage life is better now than before they lost weight.</P>

(By Edward Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
denied Saturday news reports that the Republic of China
Representative Office in Madagascar was closed down at the request of
the Madagascar authorities.</P>
      <P>MOFA announced last September that it was closing down the ROC
office in that Indian Ocean island republic because the office had
not worked well since its establishment in 1991, MOFA officials
pointed out.</P>
      <P>Recent local press stories have quoted foreign wire services as
reporting that the Madagascar government asked the ROC to close down
its office in Madagascar, thus indicating that relations between the
ROC and Madagascar have been severed.</P>
      <P>A MOFA spokesman said that the foreign wire reports were
completely untrue.</P>
      <P>The spokesman said that the Madagascar Foreign Ministry did not
ask the ROC government to close down its representative office in
Madagascar, and pointed out that Liu Shih, former ROC representative
in Madagascar, has not been interviewed by the mass media.</P>
      <P>The spokesman said that the ROC representative office in
Madagascar had failed to accomplish its mission of efficiently
promoting substantial relations with Madagascar. Additionally, the
Madagascar authorities had failed to promote bilateral relations
between the two countries in accordance with the ROC-Madagascar
Special Agreement signed in 1991, the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>After a series of consultations with the Madagascar authorities
had no concrete results, the MOFA formally announced on Sept. 1 that
the ROC office in Madagascar would be closed down on the same day, he
said.</P>
      <P>At present, a small group of staff members are still working in
the office to handle business related to the closure.</P>

(By Edward Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan reiterated
Saturday that the major opposition KMT will firmly oppose any move in
the direction of Taiwan independence.</P>
      <P>Lien also said that KMT is not a narrow-minded, biased, regional
or racist political party, but is actually a party for all people of
the nation. He added that the KMT should not be considered as only in
support of the interests of ethnic mainland Chinese or those of
ethnic Taiwanese, because he said it is supported by all the citizens
of the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>Lien made the remarks when he delivered a keynote speech at the
closing ceremony of a meeting of the board of directors of the
Federation of Overseas Chinese Associations.</P>
      <P>Lien also briefed representatives of the overseas Chinese
organizations on the ongoing KMT reforms. Because of the close
relations between overseas Chinese and the Kuomintang, the party has
decided to set up an overseas Chinese Affairs Commission to help it
promote overseas Chinese affairs abroad, Lien said.</P>
      <P>In a touch of criticism for the Democratic Progressive Party-led
administration, Lien said that Taiwan's populace has been worried
about the nation's future economic development since President Chen
Shui-bian assumed power on May 20. The KMT will review itself and
will arise again, Lien noted.</P>
      <P>Lien also skirted the issue of cross strait relations, saying
only that he hopes mainland China will transform into an open,
peaceful, democratic and free country.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lien called on all ROC citizens to pool their efforts
so as to build a harmonious and peaceful society in Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP LAWMAKER CALLS FOR 'LOYALTY CHECK' ON INTELLIGENCE OFFICERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  2  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislator Trong Tsai of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) urged military and intelligence
authorities Saturday to launch a massive-scale "loyalty check" on
serving and retired officers in order to maintain national security.</P>
      <P>Tsai made the appeal in response to a report by National Security
Bureau Deputy Director Han Kun on Friday that mainland China has
managed to infiltrate Taiwan's government, political parties and
military by bribing relevant officials.</P>
      <P>Tsai said Han's report was "no news." In fact, he said, some U.S.
officials told him in private during his trip to Washington, D.C. in
September 1999 to lobby for the "Taiwan Security Enhancement Act"
that mainland China has deliberately "bought up" Taiwan officials
under its "united front" tactics.</P>
      <P>According to Tsai, mainland China has used "money" and "beautiful
women" to bribe Taiwan officials and tempt them into providing
Beijing with classified information.</P>
      <P>Tsai claimed that many of Taiwan's military intelligence
gathering channels in mainland China are now controlled by communist
authorities.</P>
      <P>As a result, Tsai said, Taiwan now has to spend large sums of
money to obtain military intelligence reports on mainland China from
the United States, Japan, Hong Kong, Australia, Russia and several
European countries.</P>
      <P>Tsai stressed that local security authorities must continue
keeping track of retired intelligence officers to prevent them from
building up a "second spring" in their career by "selling Taiwan's
secret files."</P>
      <P>Tsai further warned that if relevant government agencies -- and
intelligence and military authorities in particular -- fail to
tighten security measures and immediately conduct a large-scale
"loyalty check" on serving and retired intelligence personnel, no
foreign country will be willing to forge intelligence exchanges and
cooperative ties with Taiwan in the future, and Taiwan's security
would face even greater challenges.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LOCAL NEWSMAGAZINE STANDS BY ITS REPORT ON VP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 2 (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A local newsmagazine announced Saturday that
it will stand by its Nov. 16 report on Republic of China Vice
President Annette Lu, and will decide what legal steps to take after
receiving an official letter demanding an apology from her lawyers.</P>
      <P>Wang Chien-chuang, president of The Journalist, said at a press
conference that his magazine did not cross any ethical boundaries by
which all professional media organizations abide, and that the issue
of apology is only a concern if it is proven that a news report does
not correspond with the truth.</P>
      <P>According to the evidence and data his magazine has in hand, Wang
said that there is "sufficient reason" to believe in the accuracy of
the report, and that the fact his magazine "went to great pains" to
"reasonably" verify the facts shows it never intended any malice or
sought to defame anyone.</P>
      <P>Lu's legal team of 19 attorneys and advisers demanded in a press
conference earlier in the day that The Journalist pay to publish an
apology on the front page of six major newspapers by Dec. 10, and
make public the full text of its apology -- to be approved by the
team -- via six electronic news media outlets, including television
stations.</P>
      <P>Lu's lawyers claimed that the weekly showed "actual malice" in
printing a "libelous" cover headline and story that accused the vice
president of spreading rumors about an alleged extramarital affair
between President Chen Shui-bian and one of his female aides. The
team also accused the magazine of alleging that Lu wanted to use the
presidential scandal to "finish off" the president.</P>
      <P>The headline read: "The person who stirred up the scandal and is
secretly competing with the president unexpectedly turned out to be
Annette Lu."</P>
      <P>On the issue of whether the magazine article actually overstepped
the law, Wang said that Lu's behavior on various occasions led to
"reasonable suspicions" that are legal topics for public discussion.</P>
      <P>Wang said that Lu's public statements at a time when the
president was facing a united opposition move to recall him were an
attempt to draw a clear line between herself and Chen, and that she
often discussed privately how to avoid being recalled along with
Chen.</P>
      <P>He added that even the greater public -- let alone professionally
trained journalists -- would question the reasons behind Lu's alleged
"surprising words and behavior."</P>
      <P>Wang accused Lu's lawyers of providing an investigation report
that "lacked all the requisites of exacting research" and questioned
whether the telephone logs announced by her legal team were truly
complete. Wang also questioned whether the vice president had any
unlisted numbers unknown to others.</P>
      <P>In its Nov. 16 issue, The Journalist accused her of contacting a
"senior media person" on Nov. 3 after 7 p.m. to spread the rumors to
smear the president, but Lu's legal team declared that a careful
examination of her residential telephone logs from Nov. 1-12 showed
the vice president did not call up members of the media that evening
or at any other time to spread such rumors.</P>
      <P>Of the three phone calls Lu made to the media after 7 p.m. during
that period, Lu's lawyers said that all three journalists have told
them that none of the calls involved the alleged scandal.</P>
      <P>Lu's legal team added that the logs showed consecutive page
numbers and time stamps, accounting for all the calls from her
official residence within the period in question.</P>

    <HEADLINE>INVESTMENT IN MAINLAND CHINA PROFITABLE: POLL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 2 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>More than half of Taiwan-financed companies
in mainland China have turned profits, the Chinese National
Federation of Industries (CNFI) reported Saturday.</P>
      <P>The CNFI, one of Taiwan's three largest business associations,
distributed questionnaires earlier this year to 1,000 of the
18,000 local companies which have registered their mainland
investment projects with the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) and
collected 147 valid replies.</P>
      <P>Quoting the survey results, the CNFI said 57 percent of the
respondents said they have made money from their business
operations on the mainland this year, while 17.2 percent said their
mainland businesses have incurred debts.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 71.6 percent said they believe that mainland China's
economic prospects will become even rosier next year, and
70.5 percent predicted that their mainland businesses will post gains
in the coming year.</P>
      <P>Analyzing the findings, CNFI officials said the optimistic
forecast by executives with interests on the mainland would further
fuel the mainland-bound investment fever.</P>
      <P>The survey also found that limited access to mainland bank loans
is a common headache facing many Taiwanese investors on the mainland.
Against this backdrop, Taiwanese business people have to turn to
Taiwan for financial support for their mainland operations and this
practice would in the long run result in huge capital flow from
Taiwan to the mainland.</P>
      <P>According to the survey, earlier opening of direct trade, mail
and transport links across the Taiwan Strait is the most urgent task
that local companies with interests on the mainland want the
government to do. And the second priority cited by the respondents
is allowing local banks to set up branches on the mainland to offer
them easier access to bank loans.</P>
      <P>Survey results further show that Taiwanese investors are not
pessimistic about the prospects for cross-strait relations over the
next two years, with 41.5 percent giving an optimistic forecast.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the simmering cross-strait tension over
sovereignty disputes would enhance risks in mainland-bound
investment, 68 percent said "Yes" while only 14.3 percent said "No."
The figures indicate that the continued cross-strait stalemate has
upgrade Taiwanese investors' risk awareness or consciousness.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, the survey results show that the scale of local
companies' mainland operations has become ever larger,
with the number of single investment project worth more than US$10
million increasing steadily.</P>
      <P>As much as 62 percent said they believe that a visit to Taiwan
by Wang Daohan, mainland China's top negotiator with Taiwan,
would be helpful to future cross-strait trade and economic ties,
and only 25 percent said they thing Wang's visit would have
little effects on bilateral trade.</P>
      <P>The majority of the respondents also said they think
economic issues should take precedence over political topics in
future cross-strait negotiations.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The only ethnic Chinese recipient of
this year's U.S. National Medals of Science said Friday that he looks
forward to seeing scientists on the two sides of the Taiwan Strait
cooperate closely for their mutual benefit.</P>
      <P>Yuan-Cheng B. Fung, a professor at the University of California,
San Diego, added that he earnestly hopes no military conflict ever
erupts in the narrow strait.</P>
      <P>Fung made the remarks in a brief interview with CNA after
receiving the award in a White House presentation ceremony presided
over by U.S. President Bill Clinton.</P>
      <P>Clinton received the 12 recipients of the accolade in the Oval
Office. Fung is the sole laureate in the engineering field this year.
The National Medals of Science are America's highest honors for
achievement in relevant fields.</P>
      <P>Clinton said the scientists and engineers receiving the medals
"have transformed our world and enhanced our daily lives."</P>
      <P>"Their imagination and ingenuity will continue to inspire future
generations of American scientists to remain at the cutting edge of
scientific discovery and technological innovation," he added.</P>
      <P>Fung, 81, has made outstanding contributions to aerospace
engineering, and is a pioneer in the application of engineering
principles to solving biomedical problems.</P>
      <P>Fung has long been famous in the three Chinese communities of
Taiwan, mainland China and Hong Kong. He is now an academician of
Taiwan's Academia Sinica, mainland China's Chinese Academy of
Sciences and the U.S. National Academy of Sciences.</P>
      <P>Fung traveled to Taiwan two weeks ago to chair the screening of a
biotech research project sponsored by the Republic of China's
National Health Research Institute.</P>
      <P>Fung said he has maintained close contacts with ethnic Chinese
scientists in the United States as well as their counterparts in
mainland China and Taiwan. "I truly hope the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait can strengthen cooperation in science-technology research," he
added.</P>
      <P>Created by the U.S. Congress in 1959, the award is administered
by the U.S. National Science Foundation. Including this year's

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 3 (CNA)
(By Bear Lee)</DATELINE>

      <P>Taiwan has successfully developed advanced a
supersonic anti-ship missile which is said to be superior to the
Sunburn missiles that mainland China have acquired from Russia.</P>
      <P>Researchers at the Chung Shan Institute of Science and Technology
said Sunday that they have conducted several test fires of the
Hsiungfeng-3 missiles, and mass production will begin as soon as the
government gives the green light.</P>
      <P>The Hsingfeng-3 anti-ship missile is yet another breakthrough for
Taiwan in its development of missiles, which has also seen the
development of the Tienkung (Sky Bow)-2 surface-to-air missile, the
researchers said.</P>
      <P>Beijing earlier this year purchased two Sovremenny-class
destroyers to be equipped with the Russia-made Sunburn anti-ship
missiles.</P>
      <P>The turbine-propelled Sunburn missile, with its 300-kg. war head,
has a maximum speed of Mach 2.34 and a range of up to 150 kms. With
its high accuracy and speed, only 1.2 Sunburn missiles are capable of
sinking a destroyer, while five missiles could totally destroy a
20,000-ton supply ship. The high-tech weapons pose a serious threat
to Western nations' anti-missile defense.</P>
      <P>The researchers said that the Hsingfeng-3 missile outperforms the

    <HEADLINE>70% OF ROC CITIZENS SAY BEIJING LACKS SINCERITY TO SOLVE DISPUTES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 3 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Nearly 70 percent Republic of China citizens
believe that mainland China is not sincerely seeking to solve
cross-strait problems in a peaceful manner, according to the results
of a recent survey released Sunday.</P>
      <P>The survey was jointly conducted by the Association for the
Research of National Peace and Security in Taiwan and Trendgo Survey
Research Center on 1,119 over 20-year-old islandwide between Dec.1
and 2. Its purpose was to learn the views of the public on
cross-strait relations, and it carried a margin of error of 2.9
percent.</P>
      <P>The survey showed that 69.7 percent of respondents think that the
Republic of China "has the sincerity" necessary to solve cross-strait
problems. The number of those who think that the ROC government is
not sincere dropped sharply to just 20.2 percent, while 10.1 percent
had no opinion or refused to answer.</P>
      <P>But up to 67.9 percent said that the mainland has "no sincerity"
in seeking to solve cross-strait problems peacefully, with just 20.2
percent saying Beijing "has the sincerity" to solve the disputes.
Some 12.3 percent had no definite views or refused to answer the
question.</P>
      <P>Yen Chien-fa, director of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party's Department of Chinese Affairs, said that the figures show
that local people continue to be vigilant against Beijing's rhetoric,
adding that Taiwan cannot let down its guard against the mainland.</P>
      <P>On cross-strait relations, those who are in favor of maintaining
the status quo and deciding later on the issue of unification or
independence accounted for the most at 39.3 percent. They were
followed by supporters of maintaining the status quo, and moving
toward unification later, who accounted for 24.4 percent. Just 13.5
percent of the respondents favored maintaining the status quo
permanently.</P>
      <P>The lowest percentages fell to those in favor of early
unification, at 3.8 percent, and supporters of an early declaration
of independence, at 2.4 percent.</P>
      <P>Chang Jung-kung, director of the opposition Kuomintang's
Department of Mainalnd Affairs Research, said that the poll shows
that those who are in favor of maintaining the status quo and moving
toward unification later have increased sharply.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Yen noted that the survey showed that those who are in
some way in favor of the "status quo" are in the mainstream, as they
account for 76.3 percent.</P>
      <P>On ethnic identification, those who believe they are both
Taiwanese and Chinese accounted the most, at 46.8 percent; followed
by those who said that they are Taiwanese, at 38.4 percent; and those
who said they are Chinese, at 12.6 percent.</P>
      <P>Chang said that these results show that people who consider
themselves both Taiwanese and Chinese are still the largest group,
which falls in line with the conviction held by the late president
Chiang Ching-kuo, former President Lee Teng-hui and KMT Chairman Lien
Chan.</P>
      <P>Yen also said that the majority of people said they are both
Taiwanese and Chinese, which can be considered Taiwan's mainstream
view.</P>
      <P>Nearly 53 percent of the people were positive on the agreement on
"three acknowledgments and four recommendations" reached by
thePresidential Advisory Group on Cross-strait relations late last
month, believing that it will help improve cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>Some 58 percent of the people are in favor of seeing President
Chen Shui-bian handle cross-strait relations according to the ROC
Constitution, which is thought to be a crucial point reached by the
advisory group to accommodate to Beijing's hallowed "one China"
principle.</P>
      <P>The ROC's 1947 Constitution does not mention the "one China"
issue, though it claims sovereignty over mainland China and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Up to 90.4 percent of the respondents said that they "agreed
with" the advisory group's recommendation that the People's Republic
of China should respect the international dignity and survival space
of the ROC, as well as abandon military threats and work for a
peaceful agreement.</P>
      <P>The survey also showed that up to 86.4 percent of those polled
agreed with the advisory group's view that the ROC has an established
democratic system, and any change of the status quo must be agreed
upon by the people through the democratic process.</P>
      <P>Liao Fu-teh, researcher at Academia Sinica, the nation's highest
academic institute, said that this shows that the public's paramount
concern is peace, and then the democratic process.</P>
      <P>Up to 70.4 percent of those polled also said that they are
opposed to Beijing's rejection of the advisory group's "three
acknowledgments and four understandings" as "empty talk, and a play
on words."</P>

      <P>The annual survey on Taiwan's business groups by China Credit
Information Service also found that more than 20 percent of the
island's firms were saddled with debts more than two times the value
of their assets.</P>
      <P>Given the fact that 1999 was the first year of recovery from the
island's financial crisis, the survey warned that the huge losses
bode ill for the island's economy, and could herald another financial
storm unless the economic prospects and investment climate are
improved in time.</P>
      <P>The survey of Taiwan's 201 business groups, including six foreign
conglomerates, show that 49 of them posted a pre-tax loss in 1999,
the latest year for which such statistics are available.</P>
      <P>Four groups have since gone bankrupt and vanished from the
island's business map. They were excluded from the study, according
to the survey.</P>
      <P>Among the top 20 loss-making groups, 13 are counted in the
island's top 100 business groups, and 10 of them are listed on the
local stock exchange.</P>
      <P>Leading the losing pact are Wei-Chuan Group, with a pre-tax loss
of NT$5.55 billion (US$168.45 million), followed by Ruentex Group,
with a loss of NT$4.56 billion (US$138.36 million), and Hung Tai
Group, with a loss of NT$4.19 billion (US$127 million).</P>
      <P>Bungled overseas ventures and the ailing local real estate market
are the leading culprits for those business groups' plight, according
to the survey's analysis.</P>
      <P>Among the top-10 loss-makers, six were in the red for the second
consecutive year, and three of them -- Ruentex, Hung Tai, and Ching
Fon -- have ran up debts worth more than five times their assets.</P>
      <P>Considering the political turmoil on the island and the slowdown
of global economic expansion, the survey forecast an even worse
performance for the business groups in 2000.</P>
      <P>Cathay Life Insurance group ranked the biggest group on the
island for the second year in a row, with combined assets of NT$1.1
trillion (US$33.48 billion). Following closely behind were Formosa
Plastics Group, with assets of NT$1.05 trillion (US$32 billion), and
Koo's Group, with NT$910.3 billion (US$27.57 billion).</P>
      <P>All of the businesses controlled by the Kuomintang appeared for
the first time on the list of the island's top-10 business groups
compiled by China Credit Information Service. The combined Kuomintang
assets were listed in eighth place, according to the survey.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EXPERTS WARNS OF BREWING FINANCIAL CRISIS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  3  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>In light of the dwindling profits and
tremendous bad loans of Taiwan's financial institutions, a financial
crisis in the Republic of China may be imminent, warned local experts
on Sunday.</P>
      <P>Huang Teh-yeh, professor of finance at National Taiwan University
and a member of the Chinese Finance Association, said at a press
conference Saturday morning that the profit-making capability of
Taiwan financial institutions declined to among the lowest in the
world in the third quarter this year.</P>
      <P>Quoting the latest issue of Business Week, a U.S. magazine, Huang
said that Taiwan's financial institutions are burdened by average
overdue loans of 15 percent of their total outstanding loans. Huang
said this figure has crossed what Finance Minister Yen Ching-chang
has called the threshold of a finance crisis.</P>
      <P>His view was shared by Huo Teh-ming, a professor at the Finance
Institute of National Chengchi University. Huo said at the same press
conference, which was called to release the Chinese Finance
Association's rating of local banks, that the nation's financial
institutions' overdue loans climbed while their returns declined as a
whole during the third quarter.</P>
      <P>The problem has been brought to a head by the intensifying
competition among local financial institutions brought about by the
emergence of a dozen new banks, said Huo.</P>
      <P>He warned that the situation will only deteriorate after the
island's entry into the World Trade Organization and the opening of
its market to foreign competitors.</P>
      <P>The banks ranked at the top of the association's list might be
free from any financial trouble, but those further down the list
could be ruined by their mounting liabilities unless they are merged
with other, healthier banks, said Huo.</P>
      <P>The association, which rates local banks by their size, financial
health, liquidity, management and profit-making capability, named
ChinaTrust Commercial Bank as the best among the island's 36
financial institutions which are either listed companies or have
their stock traded on the unlisted securities market.</P>
      <P>Rounding out the top five are United World Chinese Commercial
Bank, Chiao Tung Bank, China Development Industrial Bank and
International Commercial Bank of China.</P>
      <P>The five banks on the opposite end of the list are Kaohsiung
Business Bank, Taichung Commercial Bank, Chung Shing Bank, Taitung
Business Bank and Tainan Business Bank.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN IS SEEKING FOUR KIDD-CLASS DESTROYERS FROM U.S.</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  3 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan is seeking to obtain four U.S.-made
Kidd-class missile destroyers to replace its aging fleet of
destroyers, according to a local evening newspaper Sunday.</P>
      <P>The China Times quoted the London-based Jane's Defense Weekly as
saying that the deal, if agreed to by Washington, will boost the
island's capability to counter Beijing's newly-acquired
Sovremenny-class destroyers and Kilo-class submarines from Russia.</P>
      <P>Under Taipei's proposal, it will lease the warships for five
years, with ownership of the vessels transferred to Taiwan after it
pays off the rent of about US$500 million.</P>
      <P>Taiwan will use the four Kidds to take the place of its seven
destroyers made before World War II.</P>
      <P>Taipei has asked to purchase four U.S.-made Arleigh Burke-class
destroyers equipped with the Aegis battle management system, but even
if Washington agrees to the sale, the state-of-the-art warships are
not expected to join the Republic of China Navy until 2010, according
to the paper.</P>
      <P>The Kidds, which could join the service within five years, might
partially fill in the ten-year window, according the China Times.</P>
      <P>The Kidd destroyer is armed with a SQS-53 sonar system similar to
that used on the Arleigh Burke destroyer, which is very effective in
detecting Kilo-class submarines, according to the China Times.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CROSS-STRAIT 'MINI DIRECT LINKS' SAID TO HINGE ON BEIJING'S ATTITUDE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kinmen,  Dec.  3 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>There is still uncertainty surrounding the
much-expected opening of the "mini three links" across the Taiwan
Strait, Chen Shui-mu, speaker of Kinmen County Council, said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks after returning from a fact-finding visit
to Xiamen in preparation for the "direct trade, postal and transport"
links between the nation's two frontline islands -- Kinmen and Matsu
-- and mainland China's Xiamen and Mawei ports in Fujian province,
which are scheduled to open Jan. 1, 2001.</P>
      <P>Chen said that the uncertainty comes from the authorities in
Beijing, adding that even if local governments in the mainland are
enthusiastic about the "mini three links," the plan is not expected
to go anywhere without clear instructions from the central
government.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that his 35-member delegation visited Xiamen,
Guanzhou, where they toured the harbor facilities. Mainland
officials, including Guo Anmin, said that they personally are in
favor of "mini direct links," and that they were working on related
matters some five years ago, but they have yet to received formal
instructions on the matter from Beijing.</P>
      <P>Chen said that the mainland believes that the "mini three links"
should have been in place a long time ago, but that the Taiwan
government has set up restrictions.</P>
      <P>On Kinmen Magistrate Chen Shui-tsai's plan for direct shipping to
Xiamen Jan. 1, Chen Shui-mu said that it is still uncertain, and
depends on whether or not Beijing gives the nod to the plan. "We
cannot rashly inaugurate shipping without the invitation of our
counterparts in Xiamen," he said, noting that the high expectations
on Kinmen are absent in Xiamen.</P>
      <P>On the return of many Kinmen residents stranded on the mainland
during the civil war between the previous Nationalist government and
the Communists, Chen expressed the hope that they will be allowed to
return to their ancestral homelands in January on humanitarian
grounds, in order to pay respect to their ancestors.</P>
      <P>Chen stressed that port facilities in Xiamen will have no problem
handling direct shipping, and that Kinmen also is expected to
complete all the necessary preparations by Dec. 15.</P>
      <P>Kinmen lies far closer to Xiamen than to Taiwan, but direct
transport links between Kinmen and Xiamen have been banned for more
than five decades.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC NAVY TO BUILD 8TH PERRY-CLASS FRIGATE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 4 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China Navy recently decided
to build the eighth locally constructed Chengkung-class missile
frigate to beef up its naval defense capability.</P>
      <P>The ROC Navy recently struck an agreement with state-run China
Shipbuilding Corp. (CSBC) on the construction of the new frigate to
be christened "Tien-dan," CSBC sources said Monday.</P>
      <P>The navy began the "Kuang Hua No. 1 Project" in 1989, contracting
the CSBC to build eight missile frigates modeled on the U.S.
Perry-class warships. So far, the navy has taken delivery of seven
of the frigates over the last 10 years.</P>
      <P>Construction of the eighth, which was originally scheduled to be
completed in December 1999, was suspended due to an insufficient
budget.</P>
      <P>In the face of mainland China's mounting military threat, naval
authorities finally decided to revive the shipbuilding project.</P>
      <P>CSBC officials said the construction cost for the "Tien-dan" must
be re-evaluated because all stock building materials have been used
up. Each of the seven Chengkung-class missile frigates, excluding
installed weapon systems, costs about NT$7 billion (US$212 million).</P>
      <P>With construction of the "Tien-dan" scheduled to kick off early
next year, the eighth Chengkung-class frigate is expected to be
delivered to the navy in March 2004, CSBC officials said.</P>
      <P>They noted that all of the Tien-dan's specifications will be the
same as those of the seven other Chengkung-class frigates now in
service in the navy.</P>
      <P>Naval authorities originally planned to install Aegis-class
strategic weaponry systems on the Tien-dan frigate. However, they
later scrapped the plan in consideration of the frigate's inadequate
space, the navy's limited budget, and the possible difficulties in
acquiring the new weaponry systems.</P>
      <P>With a displacement of 4,200 tons, each Perry-class frigate is
equipped with advanced radar, artillery, torpedoes,
surface-to-surface and surface-to-air missiles, locally-developed
anti-ship "Hsiungfeng II" missiles, as well as anti-submarine
helicopters.</P>
      <P>As part of its efforts to modernize its naval fleet and upgrade
its defense capabilities, the ROC has gradually retired aging
destroyers and replaced them with a second-generation of warships.</P>
      <P>In addition to the Perry-class frigates, six Lafayette-class
frigates have been purchased from France and six Knot-class frigates
have been leased from the United States to form the backbone of the
ROC's naval fleet.</P>

US$87 billion in 1999. "As IBM's R&amp;D budget usually accounts for 7
percent to 8 percent of its total business turnover, its 1999 R&amp;D
budget should exceed our government budget for science-technology
development," he explained.</P>
      <P>Hsieh pointed that Taiwan's R&amp;D budget grew by an average of 10.7
percent annually between 1994 and 1999. The annual growth rate
dropped to 8 percent last year due to an economic slowdown.</P>
      <P>Private investment in R&amp;D registered an average annual growth
rate of 16 percent between 1997 and 1998, but the growth rate
declined to 8.9 percent in 1999, Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>Quoting a global competitiveness report released by the Swiss
International Institute for Management and Development (IMD) earlier
this year, Hsieh said Taiwan ranks 22nd in terms of its overall
national competitiveness, but its sci-tech competitiveness is the
world's 12th strongest.</P>
      <P>A further analysis of the IMD report, Taiwan ranks ninth in terms
of R&amp;D manpower, but its R&amp;D spending ranks far lower at 19th, Hsieh
noted.</P>
      <P>He said Taiwan indeed lags behind many advanced countries in R&amp;D
investment. For instance, Japan's R&amp;D budget accounts for 2.98
percent of its gross domestic product (GDP), compared to South
Korea's 2.89 percent and the United States' 2.84 percent.</P>
      <P>In comparison, Hsieh said, Taiwan's R&amp;D spending makes up only
2.05 percent of its GDP. "We are hopeful that the ratio can be
raised to 3 percent in 10 years," he added.</P>
      <P>Despite its limited R&amp;D investment, Taiwan has made progress in
sci-tech development in recent years, Hsieh said. In addition to its
12th ranking in the IMD global sci-tech competitiveness rating,
Taiwan was the fourth largest recipient of the "new design" patents
awarded by the U.S. patent authorities in 1999. Taiwan was also the
sixth or seventh-largest recipient of "new invention" patents
granted by the United States last year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>`NO RECALL WITHIN FIRST YEAR IN OFFICE,' SAYS INTERIOR MINISTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  4  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Interior Minister Chang Po-ya said Monday
that an amendment should be included in the Presidential Election and
Recall Law to prevent the possibility of a sitting president and vice
president being ousted within the first year in office.</P>
      <P>Fielding questions at a joint session of different committees at
the Legislative Yuan, Chang said she believes that the National
Assembly made an oversight years ago when it was drafting the law by
not stipulating that a sitting president and vice president could not
be recalled within the first year after their inauguration.</P>
      <P>Legislator Tsao Er-chung from the opposition Kuomintang said the
Ministry of Interior's decision to work toward including such an
amendment in the Presidential Election and Recall Law is nothing more
than licking the president's boots.</P>
      <P>Lai Shyh-pao, party whip of the tiny opposition New Party in the
Legislative Yuan, said the opposition coalition has now stopped
pushing for a presidential recall vote in an attempt to give
President Chen Shui-bian another chance to improve his service to the
nation.</P>
      <P>Lai pointed out however that the Ministry of Interior's move to
push for the creation of a barrier to the recall of the president is
suspicious and unjustifiable.</P>
      <P>Chang answered the criticism by saying that the amendment move is
still just on the drawing board and that she herself has not yet had
a chance to review it.</P>

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Military personnel should be covered by the
National Health Insurance Program based on the principle of universal
social justice, sources from the Legislative Yuan said Monday.</P>
      <P>Democratic Progressive Party legislators Lai Ching-teh and Chen
Chi-mai said they will move to push for an amendment to the National
Health Insurance Law, mandating that military personnel, including
career men and women in uniform, voluntary soldiers signed in on
contract basis, military academy students, and all military
dependents, should be covered under the national health insurance
program.</P>
      <P>Opposition legislators, including the New Party's Hao Lung-ping
and the Kuomintang's Lee Chuan-chiao and Chang Tsai-mei, voiced their
full support for the motion.</P>
      <P>According to Legislator Chen Chi-mai, citizens from almost every
walk of life in Taiwan have been included in the National Health
Insurance Program since its inception in 1995, with only military
personnel still being excluded, a situation which Chen said runs
counter to the spirit of a universal plan.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lai Ching-teh quoted a recent public opinion poll as
indicating that some 68 percent of all military personnel said they
would be pleased to join the national health insurance program if
given the chance despite the fact that they are presently entitled to
free medical care at military-run hospitals and clinics.</P>
      <P>Lai added that the inclusion of military personnel in the
national health insurance program is not only in line with the
principle of social justice, but would also help generate
approximately NT$1 billion in revenue for the National Health
Insurance Bureau, significantly helping to ease the financial strain
that the bureau has been experiencing over the past decade.</P>
      <P>Lai suggested that career military officers and soldiers pay 30
percent of the monthly health insurance premium and the Ministry of
National Defense pay 70 percent of the premium for dependents of
these military personnel, and also that the ministry pay 100 percent
of the premium for voluntary uniformed personnel and military school
students.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC ENVOY OPTIMISTIC ABOUT TIES WITH U.S.</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>San  Francisco,  Dec.  3  (CNA)
(By Neil Lu and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Despite uncertainty in the result
of the cliffhanger U.S. presidential election, the Republic of
China representative to the United States Sunday expressed optimism
about future substantive relations between the two countries.</P>
      <P>Chen Chien-jen, who flew to San Francisco from
Washington, D.C. to deliver a speech on the future prospects of
ROC-U.S. relations at the invitation of the Chinese-American
Economic and Technological Development Association, said whoever wins
the 2000 U.S. presidential election, Taipei-Washington relations will
continue to grow and thrive.</P>
      <P>Chen, a former ROC foreign minister, said the ROC government and
its representative office in the United States have kept extensive
contacts with chief foreign policy advisers of both Republican and
Democratic camps.</P>
      <P>"All of them adopt a smooth, friendly and unwavering attitude
toward U.S. policy on Taiwan and have full understanding and sensible
observation of Taipei-Washington and Taipei-Beijing relations,"
Chen noted.</P>
      <P>The seasoned career diplomat further said optimistically that
either Republican Party's George W. Bush or Democratic Party's Al
Gore wins the presidency, the basic U.S. policy toward Taiwan and
its stance on cross-Taiwan Strait relations will not undergo
fundamental changes, unless the internal situations of Taiwan,
mainland China and the United States see drastic changes.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan and the United States share enormous common
interests, Chen said various U.S. social quarters highly recognize
Taiwan's achievements in economic and democratic reforms.</P>
      <P>Chen stressed that the key campaign strategists and foreign
policy advisers of both Bush and Gore camps are friendly toward
Taiwan and strongly support continued strengthening of ROC-U.S.
exchanges and cooperation.</P>
      <P>"One China," dialogue and peaceful means form the three pillars
of the U.S. policy on relations across the Taiwan Strait, Chen said,
adding that he has long pitched for the inclusion of the "assent of
the people of Taiwan to the final solution of cross-strait issue" as
the fourth element of the U.S. policy.</P>
      <P>Chen said although it remains uncertain whether the future U.S.
administration would enshrine the "Taiwan people's assent" as the
"fourth pillar" of its policy on the Taiwan Strait issue, the
concept has become a bipartisan consensus in the U.S. political
arena.</P>
      <P>Chen went on to say the U.S. government is not expected
to pressure the ROC to negotiate with mainland China. "In fact, the
ROC government has never resisted consultation or negotiation with
the mainland on any topics of mutual concern, even political
issues," he explained.</P>
      <P>As for conflicting views on the "one China" principle inside
Taiwan, Chen said it's only natural in a democratic society like
Taiwan that the general public hold diverse views on major
national issues. "Our U.S. friends fully understand it will take
time for Taiwan people to forge a national consensus on the
future development of cross-strait ties."</P>
      <P>Chen also said he is convinced that there is still room for
further improvement of ROC-U.S. relations. "And this is the common
goal of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs and representative office in
the U.S. proper," he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>HEALTH DEPARTMENT ISSUES WARNING ON PHARMACEUTICALS CONTAINING PPA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  4 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) said Monday
that it will not immediately ban over-the-counter products containing
an ingredient that could cause hemorrhagic strokes, but it will
mandate that warnings against the ingredient should be carried in the
usage instructions for drugs that contain the substance.</P>
      <P>DOH officials said they presently have no plans for a domestic
ban on sales of over-the-counter medicines, including appetite
suppressants and cold remedies, that contain phenylpropanolamine
(PPA). But they will explicitly require that medicine containing PPA
come with instructions indicating that it contains the stroke-linked
ingredient.</P>
      <P>According to a survey conducted by the DOH's Bureau of
Pharmaceutical Affairs, 39 appetite suppressants and 297 cold
remedies currently being marketed in Taiwan contain PPA, which a Yale
University research team recently determined to be stroke-linked,
especially in young women.</P>
      <P>DOH officials said the United States, Mexico and Canada have
declare a ban on PPA in all medicine products; Sweden and Belgium are
"assessing" the situation; while Australia, Japan, France, Germany
and Switzerland have no plans to halt sales of products containing
PPA.</P>
      <P>According to Hu Yo-pu, director of the Bureau of Pharmaceutical
Affairs, the DOH previously realized the risk of using heavy doses of
PPA, so the department banned the sale of cold medicines and
weight-loss drugs containing over 75 ml of PPA some two years ago.</P>
      <P>Under the new ruling, manufacturers of pharmaceuticals containing
PPA are required to change the instructions they include with such
medicine within half a year. Violators will face fines of between
NT$20,000 and NT$100,000, Hu added.</P>
      <P>The Yale study pointed to a higher risk of hemorrhagic strokes,
or bleeding into the brain, for women aged under 50, but the U.S.
Federal Food and Drug Administration cautioned that men also are at
risk. The strokes reportedly occurred within three days after taking
the products containing PPA. The Yale study reported that it is
impossible to predict how any individual will react.</P>

    <HEADLINE>REPORTS ABOUT SERIOUSNESS OF DOMESTIC BANKS' BAD LOANS REJECTED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  4  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The issue of domestic banks' bad loans is
not as serious as what has been reported in the media, Vice Finance
Minister Sean C. Chen said Monday.</P>
      <P>Chen, making the remarks in the Legislative Yuan in response to
reports that Salomon Smith Barney has put Taiwan bank's total bad
loan figure at US$60 billion, said that a different basis of
calculation will beget different results.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lai Shyh-bao of the New Party said that the so-called
financial management policy of the ministry has been to request
domestic banks to buy shares to bolster the struggling stock market
and to allow the losses incurred in the stock market to be written
off over a span of 10 years, which he said runs counter to the
principles of accounting.</P>
      <P>He added that it is no wonder that foreign institutions would say
Taiwan's total bad loans figure could run as high as US$60 billion
and that UBS Warburg says at least 13 commercial banks would have a
negative net worth if they wrote off all their bad loans.</P>
      <P>Chen rejected the reports as untrue, saying the stated figure of
5.36 percent nonperforming loans is based on a percentage of total
bank lending, while the figure of 6.26 percent takes into account all
financial institutions.</P>
      <P>Chen said that using a different basis for calculation yields
different results, pointing out that this is the reason why foreign
institutions might have different figures from Taiwan's. He added
that those loans that are overdue for three months and also the
property taken over by the banks as collateral should not be taken
into account.</P>
      <P>Chen said that extending the period for loan payments is not
tantamount to a bad loan, adding that the government adopted bailout
measures for ailing enterprises two years ago and that up to 70
percent of those enterprises have been making regular payments,
showing that if the enterprises are given a chance, they can restart
again.</P>
      <P>Chen therefore said that the ministry has no intention of
"papering over the problem," adding that it is only a different basis
of calculation that has resulted in the discrepancy.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, Chen also denied reports that the
state-owned Bank of Taiwan, the Land Bank of Taiwan, and Central
Trust of China would soon merge following a recently passed revised
financial bill which has cleared the path for bank mergers.</P>
      <P>Chen also said that allowing domestic banks to set up branches in
mainland China had better wait until Taiwan joins the World Trade
Organization.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GOV'T URGED TO ADOPT MEASURES TO HELP TIDE OVER DIFFICULTIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 4 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Premier Vincent Siew said Monday that
if the government adopts appropriate measures to deal with current
financial problems, domestic enterprises will be able to tide over
the tough economic times.</P>
      <P>Siew made the remarks at a luncheon meeting with legislators from
the opposition Kuomintang.</P>
      <P>Siew said that every year, Chinese New Year presents a challenge
to domestic enterprises, and though economic sentiment seems
especially gloomy this year, the government can help firms weather
the holiday, which falls in late January.</P>
      <P>Siew noted that many economic indicators have been negative over
the past six months, citing the slumping stock market, the slowdown
in major investment projects, mounting bad debt among the nation's
financial institutions, rising jobless rates, and the continued
exodus of enterprises to the mainland. He predicted a bleak winter
for domestic enterprises.</P>
      <P>He said that many government officials have handled similar
difficulties in the past, saying that if the government refers to
their experience and adopts appropriate measures, then there is
nothing that the private sector can not handle.</P>
      <P>Siew noted that some foreign media organizations have painted a
bleak picture of Taiwan's economic development, saying that the
government should be on guard and address the economy as the
paramount issue. He added that the nation would very likely tide over
the current difficulties based on the solid foundations laid in the
past.</P>
      <P>On the Ministry of the Finance's decision to allow domestic banks
to write off bad loads over a period of up to 10 years, he said that
this goes against the rule of the market as well as international
norms. He added that the move is not the proper way to address the
problem, but will simply mislead the market.</P>
      <P>Siew, himself a financial and economic expert, suggested that the
government muster the determination and wisdom to deal with the
problem.</P>
      <P>He suggested that the government use the Constitution to
stabilize the political situation and solve the controversy
surrounding the construction of the nation's fourth nuclear plant and
a reservoir in southern Taiwan. He said that this would improve
investor sentiment and also help middle-aged and elderly workers find
jobs.</P>

      <P>The global semiconductor industry is

industry is forecast to exceed 20 percent growth, said
Secretary-General of Taiwan Semiconductor Industry Association Jenda

      <P>As to talk of Taiwan experiencing a brain drain to mainland China
beginning next July, Hu, who is also the vice president of research
and development at the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company,
said he considers this impossible because the mainland's
semiconductor industry has not yet reached the level where it is
able to compete with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He said that Taiwan will always be able to maintain
its competitiveness as long as it continues to invest in the

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  4  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>David Yen, one of Taiwan's most prominent
anti-smoking activists, was granted a Thai royal decoration in Taipei
Monday for his contribution to the success of control of tobacco
consumption in Thailand.</P>
      <P>Yen, chairman of the John Tung Foundation, a local private
organization dedicated to anti-smoking and public health causes,
received the "Commander Third Class of the Most Noble Order of the
Crown of Thailand" in a grand ceremony.</P>
      <P>Juliapong Nonsrichai, executive director of the Thailand Trade
and Economic Office, which represents Thai interests in the Republic
of China in the absence of formal diplomatic ties, conferred the
order to Yen on behalf of Thai King Bhumibol Adulyadej.</P>
      <P>A message issued by the Thai king said Yen's foundation has not
only dedicated to controlling cigarette consumption in Taiwan but has
also extended its anti-smoking concern to the international
community.</P>
      <P>Back in 1989, when the United States pressured many Asian
countries to open their markets to American cigarette makers, the
statement said, Yen pushed for the establishment of the Asia-Pacific
Association for the Control of Tobacco (APACT) in Taipei to resist
the U.S. "open-door" pressure.</P>
      <P>In 1993, the World Health Organization (WHO) presented an award
to Yen in Tokyo in recognition of his efforts to promote the
formation of APACT, which has since become the WHO's most important
working partner in tobacco control in the Asia-Pacific region.</P>
      <P>The citation from the Thai king also praised Yen for his efforts
to help Thailand resist the U.S. demand based on U.S. "301" trade act
that Thailand lift its ban on tobacco advertising and other
promotional activities. At that time, Yen mobilized all APACT member
countries to issue a joint statement appealing for U.S. Congress
assistance to reject the demand. APACT's lobbying efforts caught
international media attention and prompted the U.S. Senate and House
of Representatives to call public hearings on the issue. At last,
Thailand managed to maintain its all-out ban on tobacco ads.</P>
      <P>Under Yen's strenuous efforts, the citation went on, the
16-year-old John Tung Foundation has had a strong impact on the
anti-smoking campaign in Asia and other parts of the world.</P>
      <P>Yen said he felt honored to receive the decoration. Nevertheless,
he stressed that the decoration is a recognition of all of those who
have contributed to anti-smoking drives, not just himself.</P>
      <P>Noting that anti-smoking is a crusade to protect the health of
all people around the world, Yen said the campaign will not end until
tobacco products disappear from the planet.</P>
      <P>Touching on Taiwan's tobacco control campaign, Yen said that
although Taiwan has made progress in anti-smoking legislation, it
still has a long way to go in educating its youth of the dangers of
tobacco and in enforcing anti-smoking laws and regulations.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FOREIGN MINISTRY DEFENDS  DROPPING OF NATIONAL EMBLEM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  4  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
defended Monday its decision to replace the Republic of China
national emblem on its stationary with the national flag as
"appropriate and justifiable."</P>
      <P>Lo Chih-yuan, director of MOFA's Research and Planning Board,
said the decision was made two weeks ago after far-ranging
consultation and with the approval of Foreign Minister Tien Hung-mao.</P>
      <P>Contradicting news reports in Taipei, Lo said his ministry did
not serve its overseas embassies and representative offices with a
"classified notice" to drop the national emblem from all of its
stationary, adding that the decision is not "controversial" at all.</P>
      <P>Lo said his ministry decided to use the national flag in place of
the national emblem because the national emblem bears a striking
resemblance to the insignia of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT).</P>
      <P>The KMT, which founded the Republic of China in 1912, made its
party insignia the same as the "twelve-point white star on a blue
background" device in the canton of the national flag. The party
controlled the nation until it was ousted in the March 18
presidential election this year.</P>
      <P>"In order to avoid misunderstanding," Lo said, the foreign
ministry decided to drop the use of the national emblem and replace
it with the country's flag.</P>
      <P>As a symbol of the nation, Lo went on, the national flag is a
more appropriate design for MOFA stationary such as invitation cards,
banquet menus, name cards, etc.</P>
      <P>In countries which do not have official ties with the ROC and
thereby may frown on the display of the ROC national flag, Lo said,
the ministry will use a plum flower design, which is widely
considered as the national flower of the ROC, in the place of the
flag.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, former Foreign Minister Jason Hu, who is the KMT
spokesman, denounced the foreign ministry's decision as "making a
fuss over nothing."</P>
      <P>Noting that the national emblem, as well as the national flag, is
enshrined in legislation enacted by the legislature in 1954, Hu
said it is legal for the foreign ministry to use it and the decision
to drop it is "extremely inappropriate."</P>
      <P>He described as "unbelievable" the idea that any overseas ROC
government agency might be mistaken for a KMT organization because of
the display of the national emblem.</P>
      <P>If the national emblem can be dropped because it looks like KMT

      <P>Promoting the nation's stature on the international stage

    <HEADLINE>OPEN ONLY TWO AIRPORTS FOR MAINLAND CHINESE PLANES: AIR FORCE CHIEF</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  4 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China should open only two
airports to mainland Chinese commercial airliners once it finally
decides to forge direct airlinks across the Taiwan Strait, Air Force
Commander-in-Chief Chen Chao-min said Monday.</P>
      <P>In view of safeguarding national security, Chen said, the air
force will suggest that the government open only Chiang Kai-shek
(CKS) International Airport in northern Taiwan and Kaohsiung
International Airport in southern Taiwan to mainland Chinese civil
planes after the inauguration of direct cross-strait airlinks.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is scheduled to allow direct trade, mail and transport
services between its frontline islands of Kinmen/Matsu and mainland
China's Xiamen/Mawei ports, commonly known as the "mini three links,"
from Jan. 1, 2001. It is also planning to expand these links to the
"three links proper" after the two sides of the Taiwan Strait are
admitted to the World Trade Organization (WTO) next year.</P>
      <P>"Once the government makes a final decision on opening direct
cross-strait airlinks, the air force will begin planning and security
deployment to ensure national security and smooth defense
operations," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Noting that Israel once used a Boeing 747 jumbo jet to cover up a
surprise attack by four F-16 fighter jets on a Libyan nuclear power
plant, Chen said the ROC must make every possible effort to prevent
similar activity by mainland China after the opening of direct
cross-strait flight services. In the Israeli case, its Boeing
jetliner helped paralyze the Libyan air force's radar system, which
consequently failed to identify the Israeli F-16s.</P>
      <P>To prevent mainland China from using a similar tactic against
Taiwan after the opening of direct airlinks, Chen said mainland
commercial airliners should be restricted to using only CKS and
Kaohsiung airports.</P>
      <P>Moreover, he added, mainland civilian planes should be banned
from flying directly across the Taiwan Strait to Taiwan and should
instead be asked to make a detour to avoid flying over the middle
line of the strait to safeguard Taiwan's air space security and
maintain safe skies for training flights by ROC military pilots.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT THINK TANK REBUTS REASONS FOR SCRAPPING NUCLEAR PLANT (I)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  4  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An opposition Kuomintang (KMT) think tank
announced Monday a point-by-point rebuttal of the government's
official justification for pulling the plug on the controversial
fourth nuclear power plant project at the end of October.</P>
      <P>P.K. Chiang, executive director of the pro-nuclear KMT's National
Policy Foundation, said in a speech at a party function that the
continued development of nuclear power is a choice that must be made
in light of the Republic of China's national development.</P>
      <P>Chiang disputed the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
administration's explanations that nuclear power is unsafe, that
advanced nations are scrapping new nuclear plant projects, that
nuclear waste is an unresolvable issue, that concrete and feasible
alternatives to the nuclear plant exist, and that the contract
termination fines and other losses add up to less than the cost of
continuing to build the plant, which is approximately 33 percent
complete.</P>
      <P>The former economics minister and top economic planner under the
previous KMT administration said that in fact, the world currently
has 431 operating nuclear plants, with 36 more in the process of
being built and 36 others in the planning stages.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, he went on, 16 countries have a higher ratio of
nuclear to conventional power generation than Taiwan, whose six
existing nuclear units are housed in three power plants producing
22.4 percent of the island's total electrical output in 1998,
according to Government Information Office statistics.</P>
      <P>Chiang added that developed nations such as the United States,
Germany, Sweden, Switzerland, Russia, Finland, Japan, and South Korea
still use nuclear power, and that the U.S. Congress even wrote laws
to ensure that the U.S. Department of Energy will help the nuclear
industry develop next-generation reactors over the next five to 10
years.</P>
      <P>Therefore, Chiang said that the Cabinet's claim that the United
States is doing away with nuclear energy is "incorrect."</P>
      <P>The fourth nuclear power plant, Chiang continued, uses two
light-water-cooled and moderated reactors that have never resulted in
accidental deaths or injuries. Therefore, he claimed, the new
design's safety is tenfold that of the existing three nuclear plants
in Taiwan and there is "absolutely no possibility" of a recurrence of
the Chernobyl accident of 1986.</P>
      <P>In fact, there are only two identical units to the General
Electric Advanced Boiling Water Reactor (ABWR) that were to be
installed in the fourth nuclear power plant currently in commercial
operation anywhere in the world. Both are in the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa
Nuclear Power Station in Japan's western prefecture of Niigata and
these units have only been operating for three and four years,
respectively.</P>
      <P>According to Chiang, "a book on radiation and health" published
by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD),
which includes some of the world's largest economies, put the total
number of deaths caused by the Chernobyl accident at "under 50
people."</P>
      <P>Compared to what Chiang described as "the Cabinet's claim" that a
total of 15,000 people died and 1.26 million children were
contaminated by radiation from that accident, Chiang said that the
government's numbers were "obviously incorrect" and were a "suspected
attempt" at instilling fear into the public.

    <HEADLINE>KMT THINK TANK REBUTS REASONS FOR SCRAPPING NUCLEAR PLANT (II)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  4  (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Chiang went on to claim that electricity generation via coal and
natural gas is more dangerous than nuclear power, saying that the
country's three existing nuclear plants have never caused any deaths,
while at least 100 fatal accidents involving explosions occur
annually at other power plants. Therefore, he added, scrapping the
fourth nuclear power plant is actually an "irony" to the government's
dream of turning Taiwan into a "green silicon island."</P>
      <P>Regarding the disposal of nuclear waste material, Chiang said
that the "techniques are mature," and that a site for nuclear waste
will be selected in 2016 and will become operational in 2032. In
addition, he went on, new natural gas power plants can be built on
top of the land used by nuclear plants that have reached the end of
their service life.</P>
      <P>According to Chiang, the administration's promise that Taiwan
will have sufficient electricity in the next seven years even without
the fourth nuclear power plant is only a slogan, not a guarantee. If
the construction progress on private power plants -- the government's
proposed alternative to the nuclear plant -- are delayed by three to
five years, Taiwan will see a recurring power shortage "nightmare"
where electricity usage has to be limited, he added.</P>
      <P>Chiang also criticized Premier Chang Chun-hsiung's claim that
losses incurred by stopping the project will be less than continuing
to build it, adding that Chang "forgot" that scrapping the project is
tantamount to "throwing NT$82.7 billion (US$2.5 billion) into the
ocean -- there's no coming back." On the other hand, finishing the
plant would have been "an investment," Chiang said.</P>
      <P>He also cited national security reasons for continuing to build
the plant. In the event that the Taiwan Strait is blockaded, he
continued, Taiwan would have to rely on hydroelectricity and nuclear
power for the next one to three years because natural gas power
plants stop operating on the 15th day of a blockade, oil plants stop
on the 46th day, and coal plants stop on the 61st day due to the
nation's limited gas, oil, and coal reserve levels.</P>
      <P>Each of the two nuclear reactors at the fourth nuclear power
plant would have been capable of generating 1,350 megawatts.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, an anti-nuclear alliance invited a city councilman
from Niigata to testify that the ABWR units have been a source of
constant problems since they became operational. In fact, twice as
many problems have popped up than in traditional types of nuclear
reactors, the councilman said. Therefore, he urged Taiwan to abolish
the fourth nuclear plant and nuclear power altogether.</P>
      <P>With increasing demand for electricity, especially for industrial
use, the ROC government under the previous KMT administration began
plans to construct the fourth nuclear power plant in 1980. Support
for the project has been slowly undermined, however, by the general
public's environmental concerns and increasingly vehement protests
against nuclear power, which culminated in the anti-nuclear DPP
government announcement to scrap the plant in late October.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>With economic relations across the Taiwan
Strait growing ever closer, Taiwan's industrial development chief
will leave for mainland China for a six-day fact-finding tour,
government sources said Monday.</P>
      <P>Shih Yen-hsiang, director-general of the Industrial Development
Bureau (IDB), which administers Taiwan's industrial investment in
mainland China as well as mainland Chinese industrial imports into
the island, is scheduled to visit Shanghai and Guangdong, both of
which have attracted large throngs of Taiwanese investors.</P>
      <P>IDB sources said Shih will meet with mainland Chinese officials
in charge of industrial development as well as explore Taiwan-owned
companies' activities and demands as reference for policy
formulation by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, of which the IDB is
affiliated.</P>
      <P>In addition, the sources said, Shih will take advantage of his
mainland visit to study whether Taiwan should further ease
restrictions on mainland China-bound investments by its
information-technology and petrochemical companies.</P>
      <P>Shih is also expected to collect information about incentives
and measures adopted by mainland China to encourage and boost its
industrial development.</P>
      <P>Shih will be accompanied by several noted economists and
scholars in relevant fields, including Wu Jung-yi, head of
the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research, on his mainland visit.</P>
      <P>Attracted by mainland China's cheap land and labor as well
as a common culture and language, Taiwan companies have poured
some US$40 billion into the mainland for various investment
projects.</P>
      <P>IDB tallies show that Taiwan investment in mainland China
amounted to US$2.1 billion in the first 10 months of this year, up
98 percent from the same period of last year. Of the amount,
investments by electronics firms accounted for 55 percent
and marked a 158 percent increase from the year-earlier

    <HEADLINE>INTEL EXPANDS ITS APPLICATION AND DESIGN CENTER IN TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 4 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The CPU giant Intel Corp. inaugurated Monday
an expanded Asia Pacific Application Design Center Lab in Taiwan, in
view of the island's information industry potential and the need to
further serve its customers in the Asia Pacific region.</P>
      <P>Many local computer industry heavyweights attended the inaugural
ceremony, where they held up a card signifying the Pentium 4 chip to
mark the opening of the center.</P>
      <P>Wu Hui-yu, general manager of Intel's Taiwan branch, noted at the
ceremony that Intel has only set up application and design centers in
the United States and Taiwan. In the Taiwan center, she went on,
Intel offers Taiwan companies the newest technology without the
set-back of the time difference between the United States and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Huang I-sung, Intel's marketing chief responsible for Asian and
Pacific regions, said that since Intel first established an
application and design center in Taiwan in 1995, its has maintained
close cooperative ties with Taiwan's manufacturing sector.</P>
      <P>Because Taiwan is one of the world's most important information
product design centers, he said, Intel decided to expand the scale of
the Taiwan facility from five to some 60 engineers, investing a large
sum of money in advanced equipment and training more talent to
further serve its customers in Asian and Pacific regions.</P>
      <P>Wu said Intel's expanded application and design center in Taiwan
will offer the same technology supplies as it offers in the United
States in terms of desk-top computers, notebooks, PDAs, wireless and
fixed-line telecommunications and related products, to reduce the
time Taiwan companies need to develop new products.</P>
      <P>Intel also plans to place greater importance on the Taiwan design
center, she added.</P>
      <P>She said that the expanded center will focus its technology
supply mainly on personal computers, which account for 80 percent of
Intel's total operations, and on wireless, fixed-line
telecommunications and Internet, which account for the remaining 20
percent.</P>
      <P>Intel Senior Vice Chairman Sean Maloney said that the company's
move toward expanding equipment and the scale of its application and
design center in Taiwan reflects its confidence in Taiwan's
information industry.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that Intel purchased Taiwan products worth US$900
million this year, compared with US$450 million last year,
representing 100 percent growth, and forecast that the sum will
increase further next year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC AIR FORCE COMMANDER DENIES RUMORS OF LOW F-16 AVAILABILITY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,    Dec.   4   (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Air Force
Commander-in-Chief Gen. Chen Chao-min denied a rumor Monday that the
nation's F-16 jet fighters have an operational availability rate as
low as 28 percent, describing the figure as "ridiculous."</P>
      <P>Chen told reporters at a reception to welcome the air force's new
political warfare director that "he might have found it acceptable"
if the rumor claimed that the breakdown rate was 28 percent.</P>
      <P>The fact is, he continued, jet fighters normally do not have high
availability rates during peacetime, primarily because sustaining
optimal availability takes full support in terms of both spare parts
and supply and maintenance systems. During peacetime, he said, these
systems are only kept under "normal conditions."</P>
      <P>Chen added that only during wartime would the air force "throw in
everything" to maintain availability rates higher than 90 percent.
However, he said, the availability of the nation's fighters are above
the standards set down by the Ministry of National Defense.</P>
      <P>The F-16s are "very stable," and their availability rate is high,
he said. However, he added, the exact numbers are a military secret
and cannot be divulged publicly.</P>
      <P>The recent activities of mainland Chinese jet fighters over the
Taiwan Strait have been "very normal" and "stable," Chen continued.</P>
      <P>Other military sources claimed that the current availability of
F-16s can reach as high as 85 percent.</P>

      <P>According to previous reports, the United States agreed to sell
Taiwan the missiles on condition that they will only be shipped to
the island when mainland China owns a missile of similar class --
namely the AA-12 -- or there is a crisis in the Taiwan Strait.</P>

Motse's lesson of the day: "When the administration of the ruler
answers to the desire of the subjects, it manifests an understanding
of approvals and disapprovals of the people. When there is such an
understanding, the good will be discovered and rewarded and the bad
will be discovered and punished, and the country will surely attain
order."</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>U.S. TREASURY OFFICIAL TO VISIT ROC DEC. 11-12 ON FINANCIAL ISSUES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,   Dec.   4   (CNA)
(By Herman Pan and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Richard Lung, a U.S. Treasury
Department official in charges of Asia-Pacific affairs, will leave
for an Asian tour this week, which will take him to Taiwan, Hong
Kong and Thailand, sources said Monday.</P>
      <P>Lung, a Chinese-American economist, is scheduled to visit Taipei
Dec. 11-12 to gain first-hand information about the Republic of
China's policies on stock market, currency exchange rate, financial
exchanges across the Taiwan Strait and merger of banking
institutions.</P>
      <P>Lung's upcoming Asian tour has attracted attention as it comes
at a time when many Asian currencies have depreciated significantly
against the U.S. greenback.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Treasury Department sources stressed that Lung's
visit is a routine and that he is not expected to negotiate with any
Asian countries about any issues during his forthcoming visit.</P>
      <P>As the Clinton administration will end its term of office in
January, the sources said, Lung wants to take advantage of his visit
to understand the latest monetary, financial and banking policy
trends in various Asian countries.</P>
      <P>During his stay in Taipei, Lung reportedly will look into the
operations of Taiwan's National Stabilization Fund which was founded
during the previous Kuomintang government with a view to stabilizing
the island's volatile stock market.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lung will asses whether the ROC government has
manipulated its currency exchange rate for unfair trade benefits as
Taiwan's exports to the United States have set new record this year
due to dramatic New Taiwan dollar depreciation against the
greenback. Taiwan's Central Bank of China has denied speculation
that it has ever manipulated in its currency market operations.</P>
      <P>Lung will call at Taiwan's Ministry of Finance and the central
bank and other relevant government agencies during his visit to gain
a better understanding of Taiwan's current financial policy and
further market-opening plans in preparation for the island accession
to the World Trade Organization in the near future.
 Lung reportedly is also interested in understanding Taiwan's
recent passage of a legislation allowing merger of financial
institutions in order to upgrade its banking industry's
competitiveness in the global financial market.</P>

      <P>ROC Mainland Affairs Council Vice Chairman Teng Cheng-chung said

      <P>Teng said that "the final resolution of cross-strait political
issues must be based on the gradual promotion of exchanges and

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Hsinchu City Government opened
a foreign laborers counseling service center Wednesday with a view
to helping alien workers adapt themselves to new lives in Taiwan as
soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Hsinchu, a northern Taiwan city where the Republic of China's
high-tech industry stronghold -- the Hsinchu Science-based
Industrial Park is located, has more than 12,000 foreign workers at
present.</P>
      <P>Municipal officials said the new center will offer publicity and
counseling services concerning the ROC's foreign laborers regulations
in order to protect the legitimate rights and interests of
legally hired alien workers in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The new center will also provide foreign workers a proper
channel for filing complaints and appeals as well as help
resolve labor-management disputes between foreign employees and
their local employers.</P>
      <P>"The center is expected to help promote labor-management harmony
and minimize various problems resulting from the introduction of
foreign workers," said a Hsinchu city hall official.</P>
      <P>According to city government tallies, the 12,000-plus foreign
workers in Hsinchu include about 7,500 Filipinos, 2,300 Thai
nationals, 1,600 Indonesians and 400 Vietnamese people. The
remaining alien workers are from Malaysia.</P>
      <P>With technology firms in the Hsinchu industrial park,
Taiwan's version of the U.S. Silicon Valley, enjoying a continued
export boom, the number of foreign workers in the Hsinchu area has
increased steadily in recent years, causing many social problems in
the otherwise peaceful city.</P>
      <P>With the consent of the Cabinet-level Council of Labor Affairs,
the Hsinchu City Government managed to set up the new foreign
laborers service center to handle relevant issues and help local
employers improve management of foreign employees.</P>
      <P>The center is staffed with three trained counselors and three
inspectors who will be responsible for inspecting the employment
situation of foreign workers to curb illegal hiring of foreign
nationals, city government officials said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NO PROBLEMS WITH PUBLIC SECTOR YEAR-END BONUS SAYS PREMIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 6 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Premier Chang Chun-hsiung
on Wednesday called on members of the public sector to feel at ease
regarding their year-end bonuses despite the evident financial strain
the government is experiencing.</P>
      <P>Addressing a cross-sectional meeting at the Executive Yuan, Chang
promised that payments from the national government coffers will be
delivered to local governments around the island before Jan. 14 next
year to allow all the nation's public servants to receive their
year-end bonuses before the arrival of the Lunar New Year, which
begins on Jan. 22.</P>
      <P>Chang said that there are "no problems with the bonuses" and
called for the public functionaries to "enjoy a happy new year."</P>
      <P>The premier made the promise amid widespread worries that the
financial strain the government is facing will affect its payment
plans for the public sector.</P>
      <P>He added that a "salary and payment research ad hoc group" will
be established under the Executive Yuan before Dec. 16 to probe the
fabric of the government's financial structure in order to seal up
any "cracks" that are causing the government to lose money.</P>
      <P>There are presently about 1 million people working in the public
sector in Taiwan, including government employees, military personnel,
and teachers.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT VOWS TO USE NEW THINKING TO BOOST OVERSEAS CHINESE UNITY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  6 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian pledged Wednesday
that his administration will use new thinking and new strategy to
boost solidarity of overseas Chinese communities around the world in
the face of mainland China's intensified "courting" efforts.</P>
      <P>Chen made the vow while meeting with 170-plus commissioners of
the Cabinet-level Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission (OCAC), who
just concluded their first plenary meeting since Chen's
administration was inaugurated in May this year.</P>
      <P>Chen said mainland China has stepped drives to court allegiance
of overseas Chinese by launching a series of "anti-Taiwan
independence and pro-China unification" activities and driving
wedges between the new Republic of China government and overseas
Chinese communities.</P>
      <P>To cope with mainland China's nationalistic and ideological
publicity campaign, Chen said, the OCAC must use new thinking and
innovative strategy in dealing with overseas Chinese affairs and
consolidating overseas Chinese support for the ROC's national cause.</P>
      <P>"We must continue improve services to overseas Chinese and forge
even closer contacts with them so that overseas Chinese groups around
the world will continue using their clout to help safeguard Taiwan's
national security and interests in the international community.</P>
      <P>Chen went on to say that his administration will continue
exercising sincerity and patience in pursuing "goodwill
reconciliation, constructive cooperation and lasting peace" with
mainland China.</P>
      <P>"We will continue seeking a breakthrough to the current
cross-Taiwan Strait stalemate and pushing for an early resumption of
bilateral dialogue to create a win-win scenario for both sides,"
Chen stressed.</P>
      <P>Noting that the people of Taiwan used their ballots to complete
the ROC's first democratic transfer of power from the Kuomintang to
his Democratic Progressive Party in the March 18 presidential
election, Chen said the event marks a milestone in the global
Chinese community.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan has not only set a new model for democratic
development in Asia but has also added a touching example to
the world's ongoing Third Wave democratization," Che said,
adding that all local residents and overseas Chinese the world
over should treasure this hard-won achievement and work together
to usher in a new era in Chinese history.</P>
      <P>Chen vowed to establish a clean, efficient,

    <HEADLINE>ROC SHOULD CONSIDER IMPORTING WATER FROM MAINLAND: ECONOMICS MINISTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  6 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Economic Affairs Minister Lin Hsin-yi said
Wednesday that the Republic of China government should consider
importing fresh water from mainland China to Taiwan's offshore
islands to deal with the reality of water shortages there.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the Legislative Yuan, Lin said importing water is an
economic issue that should be supervised by related agencies other
than the Ministry of Economic Affairs, but he added that he
personally believes the government should have an overall plan to
help accelerate water imports.</P>
      <P>Lin made the remarks in response to a question by People First
Party Legislator Chiu Chuang-liang during an interpellation session
as to whether the "water issue" has also been included in the
government's plans to initiate the so-called "three mini links,"
referring to the direct trade, postal, and transportation links
between the ROC-controlled offshore islands of Kinmen and Matsu and
selected mainland Chinese port cities scheduled to kick off early
next year.</P>
      <P>Chiu said that, as far as he knows, mainland Chinese authorities,
in preparation for the implementation of the "mini three links" plan,
have begun moves to "export" fresh water from the coastal province of
Fujian to Taiwan's offshore island of Kinmen.</P>
      <P>According to the information he has obtained, Chiu said that the
Fujian port city of Xiamen recently began laying water pipelines and
constructing related facilities and that a 6-inch-diameter pipeline
from Xiamen to the city's offshore Dadeng Isle, located directly
opposite Kinmen and less than 2.4 km away, has already been
established.</P>
      <P>Noting that the Ministry of Economic Affairs will consider
assessing the issue, Lin said the issue may involve other
non-economic problems, such as the safety and quality of the water to
be channeled into Kinmen.</P>
      <P>He added that even if the "water links" are opened soon, the
related agencies should also come up with sound quarantine policies
to control water safety for Kinmen residents, among which are some
10,000 military personnel.</P>
      <P>Hsu Shiang-kueen, director of the Water Resources Bureau under
the Ministry of Economic Affairs who was also present at the
interpellation session, said to Chiu and other legislators that the
water resources plans for Kinmen and Matsu will take care of the two
outlying islands' water needs until the year 2011.</P>
      <P>Under the plans, Hsu added, the bureau will put up NT$200 million
a year for the development and maintenance of Kinmen and Matsu's
water resources. Among the other projects included in the plans is
the Hsishan Reservoir construction project in Kinmen, which has
already been completed. The new reservoir will be used to store rain
water and to conduct desalination work, he noted.</P>
      <P>Kinmen and Matsu, the ROC's key frontline posts responsible for
safeguarding national security, have for long been plagued by water
shortages. Soldiers, who used to make up the majority of the
population on the islands until several years ago, were known to have
practiced retaining water from the walls of tunnels, some of which
are large enough to contain underground hospitals and command
centers.</P>
      <P>Hsu said that although the proposed water imports from mainland
China may be a cost-efficient option for the bureau, the government
still hopes that the offshore water resources development plans will
eventually help the residents of Kinmen and Matsu secure adequate
water supplies in the long run.</P>
      <P>He disclosed that it costs an average of NT$50 for each water
meter reading on Kinmen and Matsu, compared with an average of
NT$9.53 on Taiwan proper.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER ORDERS FORMATION OF 'MINI 3 LINKS' GUIDING TASK FORCE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  6  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung ordered the
formation of a guiding committee under the Executive Yuan
Wednesday to ensure smooth opening of the much-anticipated direct
"mini three links" with mainland China at the beginning of 2001.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a weekly Cabinet meeting, Chang said the scheduled
opening of direct trade, mail and shipping links between Taiwan's
frontline islands of Kinmen/Matsu and select mainland Chinese ports
is a major national policy.</P>
      <P>"We must succeed in implementing this plan and cannot afford any
failing in carrying out all relevant measures," Chang said, adding
that he has directed Cabinet Secretary-General Chiou I-jen to
organize a guiding committee to supervise all preparatory work.</P>
      <P>As Beijing still refuses resumption of dialogue with Taiwan,
the two sides of the Taiwan Strait have not yet held any
face-to-face talks on the Taiwan-initiated direct "mini three
links" between Kinmen/Matsu and mainland China's Xiamen/Mawei
ports.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian has directed that the "mini three
links" should be opened under three principles -- no adverse impact
on national security and public order and no impact on the
government's overall policy stability.</P>
      <P>Based on these principles, the Cabinet has decided to carry out
the "mini three links" measures step by step. In the first stage,
the Republic of China government will unilaterally legalize the
"small-amount" trade between fishermen in Kinmen/Matsu and
Xiamen/Mawei. Such trading activities have been going
on illegally for decades partly because of geographical proximity.
Both Kinmen and Matsu lie far closer to the southeastern mainland
coast than to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to the Cabinet's plan, the ROC will allow its fishing
boats to sail directly from Kinmen to Xiamen and from Matsu to Mawei
to purchase products from Jan. 1. Nevertheless, mainland Chinese
people and ships will still be banned from entering ports in Kinmen
and Matsu because some technical problems must be resolved through
bilateral negotiations.</P>
      <P>The "mini three links" plan is designed under the outlying
islands development bill passed by the legislature early this year
with a view to boosting the economic development of those offshore
islands, mainland Kinmen, Matsu and Penghu.</P>
      <P>Kinmen County Magistrate Chen Shui-tsai said the "mini three
links" plan is not expected to bring any concrete profits to the
offshore county in the initial stage because mainland people and
ships still cannot enter the territory.</P>
      <P>"Nevertheless, we support the plan to be implemented as
schedule. We must make a bold step to break the decades-old ban any
direct trade and shipping links with the mainland," Chen said,
adding that he hopes the plan can enter its second stage in one
month or two to bring greater benefits to Kinmen residents.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, opposition Kuomintang spokesman Jason Hu expressed
his doubt that the Democratic Progressive Party's plan to use the
opening of the "mini three links" to "knock" open mainland
China's long-closed door to dialogue with Taiwan. Hu said Beijing
has shown little interest in the DPP government's "mini three links"
plan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAINAN WETLANDS STILL BOAST WORLD'S LARGEST NUMBER OF RARE SPOONBILLS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Tainan  County,  Dec. 6 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan is seeing a record number of
black-faced spoonbills migrating to the island's southern wetlands
this winter, with the number of arrivals reaching 469 as of
Wednesday, a wildlife conservationist group said.</P>
      <P>The number of arrivals is expected to increase to some 530 by
early January when more of the endangered birds migrate from areas
scattered across North Asia to the warm wetlands of southern Taiwan,
said members of the private Tainan Black-faced Spoonbills
Conservation Association.</P>
      <P>According to an international bird survey, the total 1998-1999
global population of black-faced spoonbills was about 700 to 800,
with the great majority of them consistently spending the winter in
Taiwan to avoid their cold northern breeding grounds.</P>
      <P>Most of the Taiwan-bound black-faced spoonbills have been seen in
the Chiku and Tsengwenchi River mouth areas, including the scenic
wetlands of Sitsao, in Tainan County.</P>
      <P>According to bird conservationists from the Tainan association,
sightings of black-faced spoonbills in Tainan County reached a record
high of 463 in mid-December last year. The record was smashed this
year on Nov. 24, when 468 of the visitors were seen. On Wednesday,
the number of sightings was re-established at 469.</P>
      <P>According to the Taipei-based Chinese Wild Birds Federation,
which compiles data on Asia's wild birds in cooperation with other
international wildlife groups, black-faced spoonbills also fly to
Hong Kong, Japan, Vietnam and South Korea for the winter, but in much
smaller numbers than those that come to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The conservationists added that unlike in previous winters, the
spoonbills appear to be relatively more restless and jittery this
year, probably because this has so far been a warm winter, coupled
with a late harvest season for fishponds in the Tainan coastal area,
which has affected the birds' feeding habits. The spoonbills normally
feed on left-overs of the fishponds after they have been harvested.</P>

    <HEADLINE>60.3% DEFINE TAIWAN-MAINLAND TIES AS 'STATE-TO-STATE': POLL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  Dec.  6 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The majority of respondents to a recent
public opinion poll think relations between Taiwan and mainland
China are state-to-state in nature, the public opinion research
center under National Sun Yat-sen University said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The center conducted the telephone poll of 1,085 randomly
selected adult residents last week at the request of Huang
Chao-hui, a former legislator.</P>
      <P>Huang said the survey was aimed at exploring local people's view
on the "one China" concept after the cross-party President's
Advisory Group on Cross-Taiwan Strait Relations issued "three
understandings and four recommendations" on the future development
of cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>Survey results show that 60.3 percent of those interviewed said
they think that Taiwan and mainland China are independent of each
other and that their ties should be defined as "state-to-state"
relations.</P>
      <P>According to the poll, 46 percent said they regard
Taiwan-mainland China relations as "fraternal relationship," while
14.9 percent said they think that Taiwan-mainland China ties are
"hostile."</P>
      <P>The same survey also found that 75 percent of the respondents
would not accept mainland China' rule of Taiwan, but 10.8 percent
said they are willing to accept the Chinese communist rule.</P>
      <P>A further analysis of poll findings show that residents in
northern Taiwan are more willing to accept the mainland rule than
their southern Taiwan counterparts.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 51.8 percent said they think that "one China" refers
to the Republic of China, also Taiwan's current national title; 51.2
percent said they think "national unification" means that mainland
China rules Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Moreover, 52 percent said they think if Taiwan supports
"unification" or Beijing's "one China" principle, the island
would then fall under the rule of the "People's Republic of
China."</P>
      <P>Analyzing the poll findings, Huang said Taiwan people and
the ROC government should remain highly cautious and exercise wisdom
in dealing with cross-Taiwan Strait issues now that the majority
of local people still oppose mainland Chinese rule of the island.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NO PRICE HIKE FOR RICE WINE WITHOUT LEGISLATURE CONSENT: LAWMAKERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  6  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Finance Committee of the Legislative
Yuan resolved Wednesday that the Taiwan Tobacco and Wine Board (TTWB)
will not be allowed to raise the price of rice wine without the
consent of the legislature.</P>
      <P>The committee endorsed a proposal authored by Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) Legislator Chu Hsing-yu to stem a quick price
hike for rice wine, a staple ingredient in Chinese and Taiwanese
cooking. The hike will be a result of a higher tax levy required if
Taiwan is to be permitted to join the World Trade Organization (WTO),
which upholds equal and free international trade.</P>
      <P>People are already reported to be hoarding Red Label, the most
popular rice wine manufactured by the TTWB, in anticipation of
Taiwan's WTO entry, which could occur early next year, at which point
the wine will be classified as a distillate, with a resulting high
tax levy.</P>
      <P>Shortages of Red Label rice wine as a result of hoarding actually
began as early as November 1999, when talk about Taiwan's WTO
accession was widespread.</P>
      <P>The shortages prompted the TTWB to import rice wine from
Singapore from January this year to overcome a shortfall in domestic
production capacity.</P>
      <P>At a meeting of the Legislative Yuan Finance Committee Wednesday,
Vice Finance Minister Wang Teh-shan dismissed the legislature
resolution, pointing out that if the tax on rice wine is not raised,
it would run counter to the WTO agreement that Taiwan has committed
to respect as a condition of entry into the world trade regulatory
body.</P>
      <P>The rice wine shortage has been exacerbated with the coming of
winter, when local people traditionally use rice wine much more
frequently to prepare warming soups and stews.</P>
      <P>Currently, both the domestically produced Red Label rice wine and
the imported variety are priced at NT$24 per bottle, but the price is
expected to shoot up to NT$150 per bottle upon Taiwan's WTO
accession.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>National Taiwan University (NTU) Hospital
held a "thanksgiving" party Wednesday for Taiwan's, and also Asia's,
first five-year survivor of a lung transplant.</P>
      <P>Hsia Ming-ying, a patient with primary pulmonary hypertension who
received a lung transplant at NTU Hospital in 1995 with a lung
donated by a brain-dead recipient, was all smiles at the party,
thanking the medical team which performed the transplant for helping
her regain life and health.</P>
      <P>"It's very nice to breathe fresh air normally," a grateful Hsia
said emotionally, adding that she can now walk and do household
chores.</P>
      <P>Hsia represents NTU Hospital's first successful lung transplant
and also Asia's first lung transplant recipient to have survived for
more than five years.</P>
      <P>The teaching hospital has so far performed 25 lung transplants on
21 patients, seven of whom have survived to date. Six of the
survivors attended Hsia's party to celebrate her "rebirth."</P>
      <P>Speaking on the occasion, Dr. Lee Yuan-chi, convener of the NTU
Hospital's lung transplant surgical panel, said lung transplants are
difficult because recipients are highly susceptible to post-operative
infections, while the number of organ donors and patients who are
suitable for transplants is limited.</P>
      <P>Taipei Veterans General Hospital performed Taiwan's first lung
transplant in the early 1990s, but the recipient died of a fungal
infection six months after surgery.</P>
      <P>Lee said lung transplants made headway only after the marketing
of new anti-rejection drugs in the 1980s.</P>
      <P>Noting that lung transplant recipients are very likely to die of
chronic rejection, Lee said five-year survival is an important
milestone for any recipient.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, Taiwan has many patients suffering from various
lung ailments who are awaiting transplants.</P>

5.2 years surfing the web and spend an average of 15.6 hours per week
on the Internet, according to the results of a recent survey.</P>
      <P>According to the results of a survey of local Internet users
conducted by Yam.com in 2000, information searches is the most
frequent activity among local users, with 30.4 percent of Taiwan's
total cyber population often doing so, up from the 1999 level of 25.5
percent.</P>
      <P>Information in the Chinese language has become increasingly
important for local net users, as 87.6 percent of them usually search
for data in Chinese, spending an average 15.6 hours per week, up 4
percentage points and 3.1 hours, respectively, from the 1999 levels,
the survey discovered. It also indicates that local web surfers are
most troubled by slow connection speeds.</P>
      <P>Providing Internet users with comprehensive, accurate and
user-friendly services is of vital importance to any portal site
seeking to triumph in the coming century, according to one Internet
expert.</P>
      <P>Sixty-one percent of Taiwan's net users claimed to be willing to
shop on the Internet, with each transaction averaging NT$2,611 (about
US$79), according to the survey, which revealed that net users aged
over 25 form the bulk of online shoppers and that the older the
surfer, the bigger the spender he or she is likely to be.</P>
      <P>At the same time, around 10 percent of local users own wap
phones, with which they usually play Internet games, as well as

    <HEADLINE>TAIPEI MAYOR COMMISSIONS 4 U.S.-DONATED RESCUE DOGS INTO SERVICE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  6 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Four rescue dogs donated by a U.S. company
to Taiwan were formally commissioned into service under the Taipei
City Fire Department Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou personally presided over a
commissioning ceremony at the City Hall for the four highly trained
sniffer dogs -- a Labrador and three German shepherds.</P>
      <P>During the ceremony, the head of the canine team, named Raggie,
was commissioned at the rank of "one-line-four-stars," while the
three other dogs -- Sadie, Inga and Koda -- were all presented with
ranks of "one-line-three-stars."</P>
      <P>Before coming to Taiwan, the four dogs had undergone rigorous
training in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, together with the Taipei City
Fire Department personnel who will be their handlers.</P>
      <P>As they have received full U.S. certification as qualified rescue
dogs, they form the Republic of China's first canine team to meet
international rescue standards.</P>
      <P>Ma said the dogs, aged between 1.5 years and
two-years-and-seven-months, will be used in rescue operations
involving derailed trains, collapsed buildings, mudslides and other
emergencies. "The team's entry into Taipei's rescue services will be
a boon to rescue operations in our city," he added.</P>
      <P>Ma said the municipal fire department plans to "localize" the
rescue dogs through reproduction and training, including training
them to understand instructions issued in Mandarin Chinese.</P>
      <P>Taipei's Wanfang Fire Station has installed kennel space --
including areas for eating, sleeping and leisure -- on the third
floor of its facility. Firefighters there said they were looking
forward to working closely with their new canine pals.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the fire department has asked schoolchildren at five
Taipei elementary schools to select their favorite Chinese names for
the canine team and each of its four members. The department has
proposed five choices for the team and 18 entries for individual dog
names. The final choices will be announced Jan. 6.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC REMOVES RESTRICTIONS ON PHILIPPINE WORKERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  6  (CNA)
(By Edward Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China's Cabinet-level
Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) removed restrictions on workers from
the Philippines Wednesday, with the change effective retroactively to
Dec. 1.</P>
      <P>CLA Vice Chairman Kuo Chi-jen said that because Philippine
authorities have adopted measures to train Filipino laborers to
prevent them from leaving their legal jobs after they get to Taiwan,
both the ratio and the number of truant Filipino workers have fallen
to second place among foreign laborers on the island.</P>
      <P>Concerning the issue of excessively high brokerage fees that such
workers are forced to pay, Kuo said that the Republic of China and
the Philippines have already reached a consensus on the contents of
the ROC-Philippine Direct Hiring Memorandum. The memorandum is
expected to be jointly signed at an economic meeting next January.</P>
      <P>The Philippine side has also agreed that the Manila Economic and
Cultural Office (MECO) in Taipei will intermediate in disputes
between employers and employees only with the consent of the
employer, and only with the participation of a CLA agent. In cases
where mediation fails to find a solution, CLA and MECO officials will
form an ad hoc committee to resolve them.</P>
      <P>The Philippines authorities have also agreed to stop using the
term "violation of morality" concerning Taiwan's blacklisting of
workers, and have rescinded their demand that employers should bear
the burden of all legal expenses incurred by a Filipino employee who
works beyond his or her initial two-year contract.</P>
      <P>CLA's restriction on hiring workers from the Philippines for
major investment projects and public construction projects had been
in place since June 1 of this year. The agreement to remove the
restriction came after senior Philippine officials, including the
minister of labor, came to Taiwan to resolve the issue with CLA
officials.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT CHEN URGES NEW U.S. GOVERNMENT NOT TO MENTION '3 NOES'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  6 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian
Wednesday called on the incoming U.S. government not to mention the
outgoing Clinton administration's so-called "three noes" policy
toward Taiwan any more.</P>
      <P>Chen, the ROC's first head of state from the pro-independence
Democratic Progressive Party, made the appeal while meeting with a
group of U.S. China hands organized by the National Committee on
American Foreign Policy.</P>
      <P>U.S. President Bill Clinton spelled out the "three noes"
policy during a visit to mainland China in 1998, pledging that the
United States would not support independence for Taiwan, membership
for Taiwan in any organization in which statehood is a requirement
and "two Chinas" or "one Taiwan, one China".</P>
      <P>"I hope the new U.S. government can avoid mentioning the
so-called 'three noes' policy," said President Chen, who was
particularly critical of attempts to block Taiwan's entry to major
international organizations.</P>
      <P>If the United States really needs to have "three noes,"
President Chen suggested that it add a fourth "no" stating that it
opposes mainland China using military force to resolve the Taiwan
Strait issue.</P>
      <P>Chen further told his guests -- many of them former U.S.
officials -- that his administration is willing to discuss with
Beijing any proposals for resolving bilateral sovereignty disputes,
regardless forming a commonwealth, a confederation, a special
"state-to-state" relationship or a European Union-style
alliance.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Chen stressed that any solution to the
Taiwan Strait issue and any change to Taiwan's present status quo
must have the assent of the 23 million people of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"With strong convictions for peace, democracy and prosperity, my
administration will forge a new relationship with mainland China with
patience and sincerity," Chen assured the visiting U.S. scholars.</P>
      <P>He also urged the National Committee on American Foreign Policy,
a Washington-based think tank, to offer three other suggestions to
the incoming U.S. government concerning its future policy toward
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>First of all, Chen said the United States should not sacrifice
Taiwan's interest while dealing with Beijing. "We also expect equal
and parallel engagements with the United States and look forward to
seeing the United States play the role of 'balancer and stabilizer'
in cross-strait relations and help promote peace and security in the
Asia-Pacific region."</P>
      <P>Second, Chen said he hopes that the unreasonable restrictions and
treatment endured by senior ROC officials visiting or making
stopovers in the United States can be eased and improved, and that
U.S. officials responsible for foreign and security affairs don't
have to wait until they retire to visit Taipei.</P>
      <P>Third, Chen went on, the ROC hopes that the new U.S. government
will reaffirm its commitment to abiding by the Taiwan Relations Act,
the 1982 "six guarantees" to Taiwan, and the 1994 Taiwan policy
review. "We also hope that the new U.S. administration will add a
'fourth pillar' to its China policy -- the solution to Taiwan
Strait issues must win the consent of the people of Taiwan."</P>
      <P>"One China," dialogue and peaceful means form the three
pillars of the U.S. China policy. Chen said he hopes that the
incoming U.S. government will add "no use of force against Taiwan" as
the premise to its "one China" policy.</P>
      <P>Chen further said he attaches great importance to the "three
understandings and four recommendations" recently presented by a
presidential advisory group on cross-Taiwan Strait relations, headed
by Nobel laureate Lee Yuan-tseh. "I feel regret that Beijing has
flatly rejected all those proposals," he said, adding that as Taiwan
is a pluralistic democratic society, it needs time to forge a
national consensus on Taiwan's future relations with mainland China.</P>
      <P>He also told the American visitors that mainland China basically
does not recognize the so-called "1992 consensus on 'one China,
separate interpretations."</P>
      <P>"Against this background, I think it is very important that the
two sides of the Taiwan Strait sit down to work out a mutually
acceptable definition of 'one China,'" Chen urged.</P>
      <P>The visiting U.S. scholars included former U.S. assistant
secretary for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Winston Lord and
President Bill Clinton's former top Asia adviser Kenneth Lieberthal.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT CAUTIONS AGAINST PROSECUTION ABUSES IN FIGHTING CRIME</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 6 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan criticized
the administration of the Democratic Progressive Party Wednesday for
touting its efforts to crack down on crime while cutting legal
corners in carrying out the campaign.</P>
      <P>He lamented that the DPP government has damaged what he said is
the rule-of-law foundation laid down by the Kuomintang during its
five decades of government control.</P>
      <P>According to Lien, the KMT's longtime support of a fair, just and
efficient legal system has helped safeguard human rights and social
security. He urged KMT lawmakers to ensure that legal due process is
followed by the administration in fighting crime.</P>
      <P>Lien made the comments at the weekly meeting of the KMT Central
Standing Committee after listening to a report by the party's think
tank on KMT calls for "safeguarding human rights, respect for freedom
of the press, adherence to just procedures and opposition to
selective investigation."</P>
      <P>The report by Chen Hsin-min, a researcher at the Kuomintang
National Policy Foundation, said the country's legal system is
"deteriorating" with the new government in place for only six months.</P>
      <P>Noting the search of a Kuomintang lawmaker's office and the
prosecution raid on the office of the China Times Express, Chen
asserted that these actions are taboo in democratic societies and are
rarely seen in the West.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, just six months into office, the DPP
administration has already threatened to ruin two of the pillars of
democracy -- an independent legislature and press freedom. He went on
to quote the old adage that wherever there is power there is abuse.</P>
      <P>He warned that such abuse of power will rapidly develop into a
more common practice if it is not nipped in the bud.</P>
      <P>Chen's report drew some veiled commentary from his fellow party
members at the meeting.</P>
      <P>Liu Chao-shiuan, vice chairman of the think tank, cautioned the
party to distance itself from some of its prominent members,
especially those who have suspicious reputations.</P>
      <P>He said that to clean the party's tainted image, the Kuomintang
should be prepared to "bite the bullet" and excise its criminal
elements. He said that deeds, especially ones indicating the party's
determination, "speak much louder than words," he said.</P>
      <P>Liu's views were shared by Taipei City Mayor Ma Ying-jeou, who
claimed that the party can never do too much to get its house in
order, and Kuomintang Spokesman Jason Hu, who urged the party to
spearhead the nation's campaign to weed criminals from the political
system.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's junior high school students
score first in science and third in mathematics in a global
eighth graders' academic achievements study, according to the
results released Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Results from the Third International Mathematics and Science
Study-Repeat (TIMSS-R) show that Taiwan students score an average of
569 points in science test, the highest among students in 38
countries studied.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taiwan students receive an average score of 585
points in mathematics test, next only to Singapore (604 points) and
South Korea (587 points).</P>
      <P>The TIMSS-R testing was conducted by the non-profit
International Association of Educational Achievement (IEA) in 1999
with funds donated by various countries and the World Bank.</P>
      <P>The math and science study scored students aged 12 to 14 on
their abilities in mathematics, algebra, geometry, biology, physics
and other related subjects.</P>
      <P>This was the first time that Taiwan has participated in the
TIMSS-R testing. A total of 5,772 students selected from 150
public junior high schools around the island took part in the
testing.</P>
      <P>The results show that 41 percent of participating Taiwan students
scored over 616 points in mathematics and the top-10 percent ratio
in science test also reached 31 percent. In terms of the top-10
percent ratios, Taiwan ranked second among all the 38
participating countries, lagging behind only Singapore.</P>
      <P>According to the IEA report, East Asian students generally score
far higher than their Western counterparts in the TIMSS-R
testing.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Chang Meng-lin, head of the cultural affairs
division of the Republic of China's representative office in the
United States, said Taiwan students generally perform better than
their U.S. counterparts in the elementary and high school stages
due to different educational methods in the two countries.
Chang said the United States remains the best in advanced-level
education.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  6  (CNA)
(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China government officials
Wednesday indicated their concern about the latest report from U.S.
ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor's, which downgraded Taiwan's economic
outlook from stable to negative.</P>
      <P>Central Bank of China Governor Perng Fai-nan urged the people to
maintain their confidence in the country's economy, saying that the
island's general economic fundamentals remain sound and the rating
for Taiwan's currency remains unchanged.</P>
      <P>He said that the most important thing now is "to do what we
should do, while paying attention to relevant developments."</P>
      <P>Council for Economic Planning and Development Chairman Chen
Po-chih said that many people are worried about the political
disputes between the ruling party and the opposition, but so far such
disputes have not affected the operations of enterprises or public
consumption.</P>
      <P>He said that the most critical thing now is whether or not the
national budget will be approved by the Legislative Yuan, where the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party holds only one-third of the
seats.</P>
      <P>Chen said that his council will closely watch the island's
changing economic situation, and urged the people to be confident of
the country's ability to tide over the present economic difficulties.</P>
      <P>Vice Finance Minister Chen Chung said that the Standard and
Poor's downgrade constituted a "friendly reminder" about Taiwan's
economic situation.</P>
      <P>"It is indeed a good thing to remind Taiwan. Otherwise, the
situation may turn worse in the future," he noted.</P>
      <P>Chen admitted that the report on financial difficulty
was justified. He said it was due to the fact that the budget for
post-earthquake reconstruction projects has been increased by NT$200
billion, while tax revenues have decreased by NT$100 billion.</P>
      <P>However, he said that the financial situation was not extremely
bad when compared with those in other countries.</P>
      <P>National Chengchi University Professor Yin Nai-ping said that the
ratings downgrade might result in increased costs for local
enterprises seeking foreign capital.</P>
      <P>He added that it could also exacerbate the outflow of foreign
investment, driving the value of Taiwan's currency down even further.</P>
      <P>He noted that whenever a professional foreign ratings agency
casts doubt about a government's financial management skills and a
state's political stability, the nation's flow of foreign capital
will be affected to some extent.</P>

(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Peace -- especially peace across the Taiwan
Strait -- is the common language of Taiwan and the United States,
said Premier Chang Chun-hsiung Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Noting that the balance of military might between Taiwan and
mainland China is the groundwork for peace between the two former
civil war rivals, Chang told a group of U.S. visitors that providing
Taiwan with arms necessary for its defense is in the interests of
Washington.</P>
      <P>Citing a forecast by local military analysts, Chang warned that
the cross-strait military balance so carefully maintained by
Washington might tilt toward Beijing after 2005.</P>
      <P>The premier said he hopes that Washington will address the
problem by maintaining arms sales to Taiwan despite Beijing's fierce
opposition.</P>
      <P>He reiterated the government's stance that Beijing's claim to
suzerainty over all of China -- including Taiwan -- is at variance
with mainstream public opinion on the island.</P>
      <P>Chang added that nonetheless, Taipei is willing to discuss with
Beijing the meaning of the mainland's claims, and will do its utmost
to maintain friendly relations with Beijing.</P>
      <P>He said Taipei welcomes the improvement in ties between

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian claimed Wednesday
that the plummeting Taiwan stock market has nothing to do with the
Taiwan's recent transition of political power.</P>
      <P>Pointing to simultaneous falls in other Asian stock markets, Chen
told Robert Shiller, a Yale University economics professor, that the
sharp plunge in Taiwan's stock market is in line with the global
trend. The local bourse has seen the market value of its total listed
stocks trimmed by nearly 40 percent since Chen was sworn in on May
20.</P>
      <P>In addition to the NASDAQ, Japan, Indonesia, South Korea and
Thailand have experienced a drop in stock prices, although no power
shift is underway in any of those countries, Chen was quoted as
telling Shiller.</P>
      <P>Therefore, Chen said, it is evident that the cause of the Taiwan
market's plunge is something other than the government handover.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER SAID TO BE APPOINTED ROC'S FIRST REP IN EU</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  7  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Deputy Foreign Affairs
Minister David Lee is expected to be appointed the ROC's first
representative at the headquarters of the European Union, sources
from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Lee, a member of the opposition Kuomintang, is being appointed by
the Democratic Progressive Party-controlled government because of his
seasoned diplomatic expertise and his sound people-to-people skills
and experience, said the sources.</P>
      <P>The appointment of Lee to be the first envoy at the EU
headquarters also signals the importance that Taiwan is attaching to
the development of relations with Europe, the sources said.</P>
      <P>Lee may also be named concurrently as the ROC's representative in
Belgium, replacing Huang Yen-chao, who will be re-assigned as the
country's representative in Malaysia, said MOFA officials who
preferred to remain anonymous.</P>
      <P>According to the officials, Lee, who has been a stalwart KMT
official and an astute diplomat, sought and received KMT Chairman
Lien Chan's consent to accept the appointment.</P>
      <P>Vice Administrative Foreign Affairs Minister Wu Tzu-dan is likely
to be promoted to fill the vacancy to be left by Lee's departure as
deputy foreign minister, they noted.</P>
      <P>Lee, 51, obtained his doctorate in foreign affairs from the
University of Virginia and conducted research at Harvard University's
Fairbank Center for East Asian Research in 1993.</P>
      <P>During his over 18-year career in public office, Lee has been
chief of the ROC's representative office in Boston between 1993-96
and the ROC government spokesman between 1996-97 before becoming the
deputy foreign minister in 1998.</P>
      <P>Lee's appointment as the ROC representative at the EU
headquarters is said to be only part of an ongoing personnel
reshuffle taking place within the foreign ministry since the new DPP
government took office in May of this year.</P>
      <P>Other likely changes on the ROC's diplomatic front include the
appointment of Prof. Chen Tung-pi from Tamkang University as the
ROC's chief representative in Canada, replacing Fang Chin-yen, who
will be re-assigned to another post, according to the officials.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEES KILL TMD BUDGET</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  7  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan's Defense and Budget
and Final Accounts Committees Thursday decided to kill a budget
proposal for helping finance a U.S.-initiated theater missile defense
(TMD) system.</P>
      <P>The opposition-dominated parliamentary committees deleted all of
NT$1 billion (US$30.3 million) in budget for TMD-related projects
included in the Ministry of National Defense's (MND's) secret budget
plan for fiscal 2001, which will begin Jan. 1.</P>
      <P>Opposition New Party Legislator Elmer Feng said the Republic of
China would have to spend at least NT$300 billion in the first 10
years of the TMD development if it indeed decides to join the costly
U.S.-proposed joint defense system.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Feng said, follow-up TMD development projects
could cost an additional NT$300 billion in the long run, posing a
great burden to the national coffers.</P>
      <P>Since the United States has not yet made a final decision on
whether to develop the controversial TMD program, Feng said he sees
no reason for the MND to set aside budget for the plan in advance.</P>
      <P>According to the MND-drafted plan, the NT$1 billion fund would
be used for TMD-related land acquisition and long-range,
early-warning missile system projects.</P>
      <P>In his view, Feng said, Taiwan's participation in the TMD
program could never generate benefits compatible with its
required spending on the project. "Worse yet, the move would be very
likely to further strain relations across the Taiwan Strait," noted
the pro-unification lawmaker.</P>
      <P>Senior mainland Chinese officials have on many occasions voiced
strong opposition to the U.S. plan to include Taiwan into its TMD
project.</P>
      <P>Speaking at Thursday's budget screening meeting, another New
Party lawmaker, Cheng Lung-shui, also questioned the MND's wisdom to
set aside budget for a highly expensive project whose development
prospects are still up in the air.</P>
      <P>As most other opposition lawmakers present at the meeting
echoed the two NP legislators' views, the MND-proposed NT$1 billion
budget for TMD-related projects was totally erased from the
military's secret budget plan for the coming fiscal year.</P>

(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>U.S. Rep. Frank Wolf, R-Va., has urged
his colleagues to condemn Communist China because it has continued to
repress its own citizens since it was granted permanent normal trade
relations status with the United States.</P>
      <P>In a Tuesday speech on the House floor citing recent human rights
abuses by Beijing, Rep. Wolf, a long-time critic of Communist China's
human rights record, told congressional supporters of granting
Beijing PNTR that they must now speak out against the Beijing
regime's actions against its own people.</P>
      <P>During the PNTR debate, some supporters advanced the argument
that PNTR would "bring change to China, open up the country, improve
human rights, and reduce the national security threat that China
poses to the U.S.," said Wolf.</P>
      <P>However, he pointed out, people in mainland China "continue to be
persecuted, imprisoned, and in some cases killed, because of their
faith."</P>
      <P>He added that many lawmakers said they voted in favor of PNTR
"because they thought it would bring about a positive change to
China's horrible human rights record and would ultimately increase
U.S. national security," noting that Beijing's record has suggested
otherwise.</P>
      <P>"I urge all those members who voted for PNTR to challenge the
regime in Beijing," he said.</P>
      <P>"Speak out because the people who are suffering, who are
imprisoned, or who are serving brutal sentences at labor camps need
the concerted voice of Congress to bring about real and positive
change in China," emphasized Wolf.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CROSS-STRAIT YOUTH SUMMIT CANCELED OVER UNCERTAINTY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  7  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) said Thursday it has decided to cancel a plan to co-sponsor
cross-Taiwan Strait youth summit meetings with a mainland Chinese
research association due to uncertainties surrounding the program.</P>
      <P>The DPP said the Beijing-based National Taiwan Research
Association (NTRA) took the initiative to invite the party's
Department of Youth Development and the Graduate Institute of
Mainland Chinese Research of Taipei's Tamkang University to jointly
organize youth meetings in mainland China and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The three parties originally agreed to co-host youth meetings in
Beijing and Shanghai from Dec. 9-16, with the participation of
students of mainland China's Peking University, Tsinghua University,
Renmin University of China and Fudan University as well as Taiwan's
college students who had previously attended the DPP-sponsored policy
research camps.</P>
      <P>However, the Beijing-based NTRA informed the DPP youth department
earlier this week that senior mainland officials in charge of Taiwan
affairs have pressured it not to receive any visitors from Taiwan for
the time being.</P>
      <P>The NTRA suggested that the planned cross-strait youth summits in
Beijing and Shanghai be postponed for a few weeks. Wang Ming-yuan,
director of the DPP youth department, said mainland authorities have
not yet approved his application for extension of his mainland travel
permit.</P>
      <P>Wang, who originally planned to lead the Taiwan delegation to
attend the Beijing-Shanghai youth summits, said as many
uncertainties surrounded the events, the DPP has decided to cancel
the program.</P>
      <P>Wang pointed out that Beijing authorities disapproved of the
"three understandings and four recommendations" recently presented
to Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian by Taiwan's cross-party
presidential advisory group on the development of relations across
the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>As the cross-party advisory group didn't explicitly suggest that
President Chen embrace Beijing's "one China" principle, which
downgrades the ROC to a local-level government under the PRC, Wang
said, the Beijing leadership declined to open doors for
contacts with the DPP and resumption of cross-strait dialogue.</P>
      <P>Wang said since the pro-independence DPP took the helm in
Taiwan's first democratic transfer of power between different
political parties in May, mainland China has adopted a "dual"
attitude toward the ROC's new ruling party.</P>
      <P>"While mainland leaders publicly reject any contacts or
engagements with the DPP, they are eager in private to acquire a
better understanding of Taiwan's home-grown political party," Wang
explained.</P>
      <P>Wang said he feels regret over the forced cancellation of the
long-planned cross-strait youth summits. "I hope both sides of the
Taiwan Strait can exercise reason and wisdom to resolve bilateral
disputes and make continued efforts to forge rapprochement,"
he urged, adding that the DPP's youth department is willing to
promote cross-strait exchanges of youth visits if opportunities
present themselves in the future.</P>

name list of ROC military personnel and politicians who were
allegedly involved in a graft scandal involving the US$2.8 billion
1991 Lafayette deal.</P>
      <P>The number of ROC Navy officers and politicians allegedly
involved in the graft case, in which US$500 million was said to have
been paid by French shipbuilder Thomson-CSF and other related
manufacturers to secure the sale of the Lafayette-class frigates to
Taiwan is said to be around two dozen.</P>
      <P>Chen made the appeal in separate interviews with leading French
newspapers Le Monde and La Liberation, both of which carried the
interviews in their dailies on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>In the interviews, Chen also urged the French government and
judicial authorities to show goodwill toward Taiwan by providing
related information to ROC authorities to help solve the kickbacks
scandal which also allegedly involved the murder of several people,
including ROC Navy Capt. Yin Ching-feng.</P>
      <P>Chen also asked Thomson-CSF to repay the ROC Navy the alleged
kickbacks, which were reportedly flown to Taiwan, with a portion of
them then being transferred to France, the United States, and
mainland China as "grease money" for certain figures.</P>
      <P>He said that if his appeal falls on deaf ears, the ROC Navy will
sue Thomson-CSF for breaking the contract forged between the two
sides before 1991.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the Lafayette purchase contract, Chen noted,
Taiwan is entitled to seek compensation if the French suppliers are
found to have paid bribes or commissions for the deal.</P>
      <P>Chen told the two French newspapers that although the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party government only has a minority in the
Legislative Yuan, the government's determination in cracking down on
crime is definite and unquestionable.</P>
      <P>He admitted that solving the graft scandal has become
increasingly difficult because so much time has elapsed since the
deal, so many people were apparently involved in the scandal, so many
human and technical barriers to the investigations exist, and so much
important evidence has been destroyed over time.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC FOREX RESERVES PLUMMET TO 11-MONTH LOW</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  7 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves fell to
an 11-month low of US$108.23 billion at the end of November, the
result of a recent surge in local foreign currency savings accounts,
the Central Bank of China reported Thursday.</P>
      <P>November's total, which was a decrease of US$825 million from
that of October, remained the world's third largest national foreign
exchange hoard, behind those of Japan and mainland China, according
to CBC officials.</P>
      <P>Despite five consecutive monthly reductions, Taiwan's foreign
exchange reserves in November were still some NU$4.69 billion higher
than the year-earlier level of US$103.54 billion, CBC officials said.</P>
      <P>CBC officials attributed the fall to the drastic increase of
foreign currency deposits in domestic banks, continuing depreciation
of the New Taiwan dollar against the greenback, and increased foreign
currency purchases by importers in anticipation that the NT dollar
will continue falling.</P>
      <P>The CBC's foreign exchange holdings, which stood at an historic
high of US$113.83 billion in June this year, have continuously fallen
since September, and have shed some US$5.59 billion since the end of
June, CBC officials said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves plummeted to a record low of
US$82.55 billion in March 1996, when Beijing conducted a series of
missile firings and live-ammunition war games on Taiwan's doorstep.</P>
      <P>With cross-strait relations easing and capital returning to
Taiwan, the nation's foreign currency reserves had recovered steadily
over the past several years.</P>

    <DATELINE>Kinmen,  Dec.  7  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>With the so-called "mini three links" not
yet officially established, two mainland Chinese men were found
Thursday to have illegally crossed over to Kinmen to conduct
"business talks," police sources from the offshore island reported.</P>
      <P>Wang Junzhen, 29, and Wang Jianpuo, 28, both from mainland
China's coastal province of Fujian, were caught red-handed in a
restaurant in downtown Kinmen around 4 a.m. Thursday, where they were
discussing "commercial exchanges" with three Kinmen business people,
the police said.</P>
      <P>According to the police, while the two Wangs were brought in for
interrogation, the three Kinmen locals fled during the midnight
crackdown.</P>
      <P>Wang Junzhen told the police that he is an employee of a fishery
production company in the Fujian port city of Xiamen. He said that
his boss sent him to the ROC-controlled outlying island to scout the
local market, particularly looking to set up potential sales of fish
and seaweed. He added that his boss wanted to get a jump on the
scheduled establishment of the "mini three links" early next year.</P>
      <P>The so-called "mini three links" -- referring to direct trade,
postal and transportation links between the ROC-control frontline
islands of Kinmen and Matsu and select mainland Chinese port cities,
including Xiamen -- are planned to be set up the ROC government in an
attempt to facilitate exchanges between Taiwan and mainland China and
help ease tensions across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Wang confessed that he and the other Wang, a fisherman, departed
Xiamen around midnight aboard a motored sampan and arrived around
1:30 a.m. on the shores of Kinmen, where they were picked up by
several local people and driven away in a sedan.</P>
      <P>Wang said they were originally scheduled to leave Kinmen for home
around 5 a.m. the same day.</P>
      <P>The pair will be sent to a detention center in Taiwan after their
interrogations are completed, said the police, who added that they
will continue trying to hunt down the three Kinmen residents who
fled.</P>

    <HEADLINE>'1992 CONSENSUS' SAID BEIJING'S BOTTOM LINE FOR 'ONE CHINA'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 7 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Main opposition Kuomintang Vice Chairman Wu
Poh-hsiung said Thursday he is convinced that the "1992 consensus"
reached between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait is Beijing's
bottom line regarding its cherished "one China" principle.</P>
      <P>Wu made the remarks while briefing members of a KMT Legislative
Yuan subgroup on his recent visit to the mainland. Wu was the
highest-ranking KMT official to visit there since the 106-year-old
party was driven to Taiwan by the Chinese Communist Party in a civil
war in 1949.</P>
      <P>During his Nov. 17-28 visit, Wu met with senior mainland
officials in charge of Taiwan affairs, including Vice Premier Qian
Qichen and Wang Daohan, the top mainland negotiator with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>After extensive talks with mainland officials, Wu said he has
come to understand that the Beijing leadership is unlikely to
accept any Taiwan retreat from the "1992 consensus" as far as
cross-strait relations are concerned.</P>
      <P>Wu said mainland leaders basically understand the previous
KMT-led Republic of China government's stances on cross-strait
ties.</P>
      <P>"Mainland leaders understand our claims that China is now divided
and separately ruled, that before the two sides are unified under
democracy, each side can have its own interpretation of 'one China,'
that the ROC is an equal entity to the PRC, and that the 'one
country, two systems' Beijing used to take over Hong Kong and
Macau is not applicable to Taiwan," Wu explained.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Wu admitted that the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait remain far divided over the content of "one China" or
"unification."</P>
      <P>Wu said he hopes the current Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP)-led government can return to the 1992 "one China, separate
definitions" consensus, which allowed Taipei and Beijing to hold a
historic high-level conference in Singapore in 1993, commonly
known as the "Koo-Wang" meeting.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan's bargaining chips vis-a-vis mainland
China are gradually fading away, Wu said the new ROC government
should not drag its feet in play of words and should instead focus
on forging a national consensus on future cross-strait ties to
facilitate resumption of cross-strait dialogue.</P>
      <P>The current DPP government has been reluctant to recognize the
so-called 1992 "one China, separate definitions" consensus because
the DPP's pro-independence diehards could not accept "one China" or
"unification" as the sole option for Taiwan's future.</P>
      <P>Wu said the new ROC government should give priority to the
common interest of the 23 million Taiwan people and make strenuous
efforts to forge a national consensus on the critical "one China"
issue. According to Wu, mainland leaders remain highly suspicious of
the DPP administration because of the party's pro-independence
stance.</P>
      <P>Wu said he had told his mainland hosts that their fears of
Taiwan declaring independence were overblown because the majority of
Taiwan people do not support such a move. "I advised mainland
leaders not to overreact to the independence-unification debate in
Taiwan as their hardline, bellicose rhetoric would only hurt Taiwan
people's feelings and hinder bilateral rapprochement."</P>
      <P>Wu went on to suggest that the DPP step up efforts to forge
contacts with the Chinese Communist Party. "I hope to see more DPP
heavyweights travel to the mainland to push for inter-party
exchanges and facilitate formulation of the new ROC government's
policy toward mainland China," he said, adding that more mainland
visits would help DPP officials formulate more realistic, feasible
policy and strategy on cross-strait affairs.</P>
      <P>To his knowledge, some mainland scholars are studying various
possible formulas, including "commonwealth" and "confederation," for
future Taiwan-mainland China relations.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the two sides can sign an agreement on mutual arms
reduction, Wu said he does not think that the proposal is feasible.
"As mainland China' military buildup plans are based on its global
combat strategy, it is unlikely to suspend development of
long-range strategic missiles and other relevant weaponry systems
simply for Taiwan's demand," he explained.</P>
      <P>Wu also reiterated his view that the time is still not ripe for
KMT Chairman Lien Chan to visit the mainland. "Lien's visit must be
conducive to cross-strait ties. Such a condition has not yet
ripened," he added.</P>

(By Edward Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou said Thursday that
efforts to upgrade Taipei's status in the list of "most livable"
Asian cities will continue.</P>
      <P>Ma said the criteria of evaluating cities change slightly every
year, but domestic changes in the Republic of China as a whole also
can have an impact on the city's ranking.</P>
      <P>According to a list published in the Dec. 8 issue of Asiaweek,
Taipei is ranked as the fourth best Asian city in which to reside.
The ranking was something of a disappointment after the city's
second-place position on last year's list.</P>
      <P>Tokyo and Fukuoka were tied for first this year, with Tokyo
rising from fourth place on 1999's list. Fukuoka occupied the first
place ranking by itself last year.</P>
      <P>Singapore was ranked third this year, while Osaka and Taipei --
which tied for second last year -- slid into fourth in the latest
rankings.</P>
      <P>Noting that the city is at least still ranked among the top five
in Asia, Ma attributed Taipei's high marks to the efforts of all of
his predecessors. But he admitted that Taipei still has a room to
improve.</P>

(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's export and import growth forecasts
for 2000 will possibly be pared by one percentage point due to a slow
global economy and continued depreciation of the local currency, the
Finance Ministry announced Thursday.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the nation's exports have seen 14 consecutive
months of double-digit growth, the ministry said that the
Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting, and Statistics (DGBAS) may
have to adjust its annual export growth estimate from 23.1 percent to
22.1 percent, while its import growth forecast for the year may drop
from 28.1 percent to 27.1 percent.</P>
      <P>Additionally, the DGBAS forecast for this year's trade surplus
may drop from US$7.9 billion to US$7.8 billion, the ministry
announced.</P>
      <P>However, Taiwan's external trade continues to expand steadily,
the ministry noted.</P>
      <P>According to Finance Ministry statistics, export volume for
November reached US$12.72 billion, a 10.3 percent increase from the
same period last year, mainly due to increased exports to the United
States, Europe, Japan, South Korea, and the five members of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).</P>
      <P>Import volume reached US$11.95 billion during the month, an 18.2
percent increase from November 1999, due mainly to increased imports
from the United States, Japan, and the ASEAN region; while the
nation's monthly trade surplus reached US$770 million, US$650 million
less than last year same period, according to the ministry.</P>
      <P>Rapid growth in global trade volume and Taiwan's increasing
competitiveness in high-tech exports drove the rapid growth figures,
with electronics, information technology, and mechanical and optical
equipment the leading sectors in exports, the ministry said.</P>
      <P>It concluded that if the domestic economic and political
situations can be stabilized, and if the degree of influence on the
domestic economy by non-economic factors can be decreased, the
economy will be able to maintain continued steady growth.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian presided over a
grand welcoming ceremony Thursday for Salvadoran President Francisco
Guillermo Flores Perez, who arrived in Taipei Wednesday for a
four-day state visit.</P>
      <P>Flores was accorded full military honors, complete with a 21-gun
salute, in the ceremony held at the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall
complex near the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>In his welcoming remarks, Chen said the Republic of China highly
treasures its 60-plus-year friendship with El Salvador.</P>
      <P>Chen, who took office in Taiwan's first democratic transfer of
power between different political parties in May, also stressed the
continuity of ROC foreign policy.</P>
      <P>Chen said the ROC government will honor all bilateral promises
and obligations under treaties and agreements with El Salvador.
"We'll also continue upgrading relations and cooperation with El
Salvador based on current foundations," he added.</P>
      <P>He further said the ROC will consider favorably a request for
agricultural technology assistance presented by Salvadoran Vice
President Carlos Quintanilla Schmidt during a visit he made to Taiwan
in October.</P>
      <P>Chen also expressed his gratitude for the Salvadoran government
and people's longtime support and assistance for the ROC's bids to
join international activities and organizations, including the United
Nations.</P>
      <P>For his part, Flores said El Salvador appreciates the ROC's
assistance in its economic and agricultural development over past
decades. "We look forward to further strengthening our cooperation in
various fields in the future," he added.</P>
      <P>After the welcoming ceremony, the two heads of the state held
talks on a range of issues at the ROC Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>During their talks, Chen assured Flores that the ROC is more than
willing to share its developmental experiences with El Salvador and
promote bilateral cooperation in investment, trade, culture and
science/technology development to cope with the challenges of the
"new economy" era.</P>
      <P>They also exchanged views on regional and global situations. Chen
said the ROC wants to work together with all of its diplomatic allies
under bilateral or multilateral cooperative frameworks for boosting
economic, sci-tech and cultural development and jointly create a
peaceful, free and stable new century.</P>
      <P>This is Flores' second visit to Taiwan. During his stay, he will
sign a joint communique with Chen and will meet with Premier Chang
Chun-hsiung, Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng, Foreign
Minister Tien Hung-mao and other senior ROC officials.</P>
      <P>He will also deliver a speech to the ROC legislature Friday.

    <TEXT>
      <P>An international pilot's group appealed
to Taipei authorities Wednesday to allow three pilots of a crashed
Singapore Airlines (SIA) airplane to return home.</P>
      <P>If the three pilots are not allowed to leave Taiwan before
Christmas and the New Year, the England-based International
Federation of Airline Pilots Associations might boycott flights to
Taiwan, said its president, Ted Murphy.</P>
      <P>However, Murphy went on, the boycott will be launched only as a
last resort if all other efforts to persuade Taipei prosecutor's to
allow the three pilots to leave have failed.</P>
      <P>Murphy, who arrived in Singapore Thursday on his way from New
Zealand to England accused Taipei in a statement of jeopardizing
international flight safety by forbidding the three pilots from
leaving the island, causing anxiety among other pilots and inevitably
compromising their flying performance.</P>
      <P>The three SIA pilots have been prohibited from leaving Taiwan
ever since their Boeing 747 airplane crashed during takeoff on Oct.
31. Local prosecutors said they might charge all three with
involuntary manslaughter for the 82 passengers among the 179 aboard
killed when flight SQ006 tried to take off at Chiang Kai-shek
International Airport from a runway closed for repair.</P>
      <P>Murphy said in his statement that "even if they are to be the
subject of legal proceedings in due course, there can be no
justification for not allowing these individuals to return home
pending those proceedings, so that they can continue their recovery
from the trauma of the accident within their home environments."</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  7  (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Members of a U.S. think tank visited the
Republic of China's Economics Ministry Thursday to find out about
possible adjustments in Taiwan's economic policies following its
accession into the World Trade Organization (WTO).</P>
      <P>After meeting the six delegates, Economics Vice Minister Chen
Ruey-lung described the National Committee on American Foreign Policy
(NCAFP) as an "influential" think tank in the United States whose
members may very well be invited to join the new U.S. administration.</P>
      <P>The members include Winston Lord, former U.S. assistant secretary
for East Asian and Pacific Affairs; Kenneth Lieberthal, former head
of the Asian affairs division of the U.S. National Security Council;
Douglas Paal, head of the Asia Pacific Policy Center and a former
member of the U.S. National Security Council; Robert A. Scalapino,
professor of East Asian studies at University of California at
Berkley; NCAFP Chairman George Schwab; and senior NCAFP member Donald
Zagoria.</P>
      <P>Chen told the delegates that Taiwan hopes the United States can
support Taiwan's WTO accession into the WTO within the same timeframe
as mainland China's membership. According to Chen, the delegates
replied that many WTO member countries support this stance.</P>
      <P>Chen quoted his visitors as saying that the whole world knows how
difficult it is for a government to control capital flow where the
aim is to seek profits. They then asked Chen how Taiwan feels about
reports that US$70 billion of Taiwan's capital has gone to mainland
China.</P>
      <P>Chen replied that his ministry's statistics show that only
approximately US$16.5 billion-worth of Taiwan capital has been
invested in mainland China, while the mainland's official figures
show that the amount of promissory investment totals US$45 billion
along with US$35 billion in actual investment. Therefore, he added,
his ministry believes that the actual figure is not as high as the
US$70 billion claimed in the reports.</P>
      <P>The vice minister said that the ministry is looking into
adjusting the policy of "no haste, be patient" in terms of Taiwan
investment in mainland China, and the policy of establishing direct
trade, postal, and transportation links between the two sides. The
ministry expects to see the adjustment proposals ready by the end of
the month after further analysis with the Mainland Affairs Council
and other related government agencies, he said.</P>
      <P>The U.S. think tank delegation left Taiwan for mainland China
later in the day, winding up a three-day fact-finding tour to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>While in Taipei, they called on ROC President Chen Shui-bian and
met with both ruling and opposition political heavyweights.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIPEI MAYOR MEETS U.S. CHINA HANDS ON CROSS-STRAIT TIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  7  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou said Thursday
Taiwan must avoid causing confrontation between the United States
and mainland China for the sake of its own national interest.</P>
      <P>Ma, the brightest political star in the opposition Kuomintang
(KMT), made the remarks after meeting with a group of U.S. China
hands organized by the influential Washington-based think tank --
the National Committee on American Foreign Policy (NCAFP).</P>
      <P>Ma said the visiting scholars, many of them former U.S.
officials, had told him that they were afraid that Republic
of China President Chen Shui-bian's public call on the incoming
American government to add a "fourth no" to the so-called "three
noes" policy toward Taiwan might have an adverse impact on the
delicate Taipei-Washington-Beijing triangular relations.</P>
      <P>"In their opinion, the U.S. scholars thought that President Chen
should have made such an appeal in private, not in public," Ma said,
adding that he himself agreed with the American visitors'
view.</P>
      <P>Ma, who holds a Ph.D. from Harvard University, said Taiwan
should avoid pressuring the United States to make a choice between
the two sides of the Taiwan Strait. "Otherwise, Taiwan itself will
suffer a backlash," he noted.</P>
      <P>During a meeting with the U.S. scholars Wednesday, President
Chen said he hopes that the new American government will avoid
mentioning the so-called "three noes" policy toward Taiwan, or at
least add a "fourth no" -- no Beijing use of force to resolve the
Taiwan Strait issue.</P>
      <P>U.S. President Bill Clinton spelled out the "three noes"
policy during a visit to mainland China in 1998, pledging that the
United States would not support independence for Taiwan, membership
for Taiwan in any organization in which statehood is a requirement
and "two Chinas" or "one Taiwan, one China."</P>
      <P>Noting that the first two "noes" comply with the ROC's
constitution, Ma said he thinks that the ROC government
should focus its efforts to persuade the United States to
soften its third "no."</P>
      <P>Ma said one of major concerns of his guests was that if
Presdient Chen, a stalwart of the pro-independence Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP), recognizes the previous KMT government's
"one China, separate definitions" stance, also known as the "1992
consensus," will major Taiwan opposition parties accept Chen's views
on mainland affairs?</P>
      <P>"My observation was that since Taiwan's opposition parties all
support the '1992 consensus,' Chen's recognition of the 'one China,
separate interpretations' stance would greatly facilitate the
formation of a national consensus on the ROC's cross-strait policy,"
Ma said.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Ma said he had also reminded the American visitors
that Taian people's top concerns are the ROC's national security and
rights to participate in international activities.</P>
      <P>"We certainly hope that Beijing can show goodwill on these
two critical issues if we are going to negotiate sensitive
political issues with it," Ma said.</P>
      <P>Ma further explained that although Taiwan will not use the two
demands as preconditions for resumption of cross-strait dialogue,
Beijing should at least make it clear that it will deal with the
two issues prudently and will not easily take hostile attitude toward
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Ma said the United States does not want to see the current
cross-strait deadlock continue in the years ahead and that most
visiting American scholars support Taiwan's return to the "1992
consensus."</P>
      <P>Judging from the current situation, Ma said whoever wins the
cliffhanger U.S. presidential election will not have strong
majority support in Congress. "Against this background, the new U.S.
administration will very likely lean toward Beijing if it feels
Taiwan does not show sufficient sincerity to improve cross-strait
relations.</P>
      <P>The members of the NCAFP delegation included Winston Lord, former
U.S. assistant secretary for East Asian and Pacific Affairs; Kenneth
Lieberthal, former head of the Asian affairs division of the U.S.
National Security Council; Douglas Paal, head of the Asia Pacific
Policy Center and a former member of the U.S. National Security
Council; Robert A. Scalapino, professor of East Asian studies at
University of California at Berkley; NCAFP Chairman George Schwab;
and senior NCAFP member Donald Zagoria.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT VICE CHAIRMAN MEETS WITH U.S. THINK TANK DELEGATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 7 (CNA)
(By Edward Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang Vice Chairman Vincent
Siew met with a group of visiting U.S. think tank members to discuss
bilateral ties between Taiwan and the United States, as well as
cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>Siew told the group of members of the National Policy Committee
of American Foreign Relations that cross-strait relations will
improve only when the Republic of China convenes the National
Unification Council meeting in accordance with the National
Reunification Guidelines.</P>
      <P>He added that such a meeting could result in a national consensus
on the issue, which would allow resumed talks between the two sides
of the Taiwan Strait. This would create a win-win result for both
sides of the Strait, and would be in the interests of the United
States in the Asia Pacific region, he said.</P>
      <P>Siew made the comments to the six members of a U.S. think tank
who called on KMT Headquarters. In addition to Siew, they also met
with Stephen Chen, former ROC Representative in Washington D.C., and
KMT Deputy Secretary General Shaw Yu-ming. KMT Chairman left Taiwan
Wednesday for a visit to Britain and Italy.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, Siew said the new ROC administration has
failed to present effective measures to resolve the deadlocked cross
strait relations since assuming power six months ago. The National
Reunification Guidelines are the best way to resolve the currently
deadlocked cross-strait relations, according to Siew.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Shaw said the Chen administration wants to use the
"three acknowledgments and four suggestions" of the Presidential
Advisory Group on Cross Strait Relations to open the deadlocked
cross-strait ties. He described this as "wishful thinking" and
"playing games with words."</P>
      <P>During the meeting, members of the U.S. think tank expressed
their concern about the political situation in Taiwan after the
island's first power transition on May 20.</P>
      <P>In response to his U.S. visitors questions, Siew said that Taiwan
has been set back both politically and economically during the past
six months under President Chen Shui-bian's leadership, adding that
this was mainly because the ruling Democratic Progressive Party-led
administration has managed national affairs according to its own
ideology.</P>
      <P>The U.S. think tank delegation left here for mainland China
later, after winding up a three-day fact-finding tour to the Republic
of China.</P>
      <P>While in Taipei, they called on President Chen Shui-bian and met
with both ruling and opposition political leaders.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT REJECTS VISIT BY DPP CHAIRMAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  7  (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) rejected
Thursday a meeting between ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
Chairman Frank Hsieh and KMT Chairman Lien Chan, saying it would be
meaningless if Hsieh does not apologize for insulting the KMT.</P>
      <P>KMT Secretary-General Lin Feng-cheng, who made the statement on
behalf of the Republic of China's main opposition party, was
referring to Hsieh's observation about corruption in the KMT when it
was in power.</P>
      <P>Lin also denied a report that the KMT has agreed to a visit by
Hsieh after Lien returns from a visit to Europe.</P>
      <P>Lien was defeated by the DPP's Chen Shui-bian in the ROC's March
presidential election, ending more than 50 years of KMT rule in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, Lien "showed his sincerity" by visiting Hsieh
Oct. 2 and later attending a meeting called by Chen to discuss issues
related to the interests of the country.</P>
      <P>However, Lin went on, the DPP then announced its decision to
scrap the partially constructed fourth nuclear power plant, also a
product of KMT rule, only 30 minutes after the Chen-Lien meeting. The
move provoked a political storm in Taiwan and led to an opposition
move to oust the president.</P>
      <P>In the ensuing squabble between the ruling and opposition
parties, Hsieh blasted the KMT as corrupt.</P>
      <P>Lin said the KMT members are furious about Hsieh's remarks,
adding that they cannot imagine that such "irrational words" would be
spoken with someone with any knowledge of the law. Hsieh majored in
law.</P>
      <P>In related issues, meanwhile, KMT sources said the DPP has
inquired of them about their wish to convene a national affairs
conference to amend the Constitution, to which they responded that
the most important thing at present is to respect the Constitution.</P>
      <P>The KMT sources said that Chen does not respect the Constitution
and has failed to respond to the opposition's call for a "dual head"
system, under which the president must appoint a premier from the
majority party in the legislature, or a premier who has the approval
of the legislature.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.S. THINK TANK RECOMMENDS TAIPEI-BEIJING ARMS RESTRAINT AGREEMENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  7  (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Members of a U.S. think tank recommended
that Taipei and Beijing sign an "arms restraint agreement," but a
spokesman for the Republic of China Defense Ministry said Thursday
that the development of a mutual trust mechanism should come first.</P>
      <P>According to the Ministry of National Defense (MND) official, the
visiting members of the National Committee on American Foreign Policy
(NCAFP) brought up their suggestion twice during their three-day
fact-finding trip.</P>
      <P>The NCAFP members include Winston Lord, former U.S. assistant
secretary for East Asian and Pacific Affairs; Kenneth Lieberthal,
former head of the Asian affairs division of the U.S. National
Security Council; Douglas Paal, head of the Asia Pacific Policy
Center and a former member of the U.S. National Security Council;
Robert A. Scalapino, professor of East Asian studies at University of
California at Berkley; NCAFP Chairman George Schwab; and senior NCAFP
member Donald Zagoria.</P>
      <P>However, he continued, only through a foundation of cross-Taiwan
Strait military confidence-building measures can the two sides begin
to talk further about the possibility of arms restraint.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the official said, mainland China has not yet
responded to the numerous overtures made by ROC Defense Minister Wu
Shih-wen on the establishment of a mutual trust mechanism.</P>
      <P>According to the MND, Taiwan has always been positive about the
idea of such a mechanism, but there are currently no concrete
developments in cross-strait military issues.</P>
      <P>The MND added that the ROC National Defense University even
publicly proposed at a seminar last week the concept of establishing
a telephone hotline between Taipei and Beijing, complete with various
evaluations and timetables for the establishment of such a hotline.</P>
      <P>Although signing an agreement to restrict arms buildups may be
able to resolve the crisis of accidentally sparking off a conflict in
the strait, the MND official said that there would still be "a long
way to go" if the foundation of military mutual trust is not there.</P>
      <P>The U.S. think tank delegation left Taiwan for mainland China
later in the day. While in Taipei, they called on ROC President Chen
Shui-bian and met with both ruling and opposition political
heavyweights.</P>

(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Central Bank of China (CBC) announced
Thursday a five percent reserve for every deposit in foreign currency
as part of an attempt to stop the slide of the new Taiwan dollar
against the greenback.</P>
      <P>Under the new regulation, which the bank said was set in line
with the practices of financial centers in the European Union, Japan
and Singapore, local banks are required to deposit with the CBC
reserves of five percent of the foreign currency savings they receive
from customers.</P>
      <P>In a press conference called to announce the new regulation, CBC
officials said the decision was reached in a meeting of the CBC
councilors Thursday evening.</P>
      <P>Chou A-ting, director-general of the Foreign Exchange Department
under the CBC, said the measure was imposed briefly between June and
November of 1990, and between September 1993 and March 1994, and
achieved the desired results.</P>
      <P>Chou also allayed fears that local banks will bear heavier
interest since Standard &amp; Poor's downgraded its outlook on Taiwan's
sovereign ratings Wednesday, saying that the CBC is willing to lend
foreign currency to local banks at the usual market rates.</P>
      <P>A local analyst said the CBC's move was designed to prop up the
local currency against the greenback while meeting the seasonally
surging demands for N.T. dollars around Chinese New Year, which falls
on Jan. 24.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Taipei branch office of Netherlands-based ABN AMRO
Bank scaled down its interest rates on deposits in foreign currency
in anticipation a drop in rates in the United States.</P>
      <P>Local analysts predicted that the move is the harbinger of a
similar drop in rates on foreign currency deposits.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>"Four Seas Gang" leader Yang Kuang-nan, who
was repatriated back to Taiwan from mainland China via Macau
Wednesday, was interrogated Thursday by prosecutors of the Taipei
District Prosecutor's Office.</P>
      <P>Information from the Criminal Investigation Bureau indicated that
Yang is an important figure in the 1998 murder of Yuanta Securities
Vice President Huang Nai-hsuan, but Yang claimed to know nothing
about the background of the murder or of the 1996 slaying of gang
leader Chen Yung-ho.</P>
      <P>He also denied the report that the influence of the "Four Seas
Gang" extends as far as the mainland Chinese city of Shanghai.</P>
      <P>Yang fled Taiwan to the mainland several years ago. He was
pronounced "persona non grata" by Shanghai law enforcement
authorities last March and expelled to Macau, where he was to
be handed over to Taiwan police.</P>
      <P>However, with the help of local gangsters, Yang eluded Taiwan
police at Macau Airport and fled to Singapore, from where he
re-entered the mainland on a fake passport.</P>
      <P>Last month, Shanghai law enforcement authorities apprehended Yang

      <P>There is no question that Washington would
like to see the dispute between Taiwan and mainland China solved
peacefully, a delegation from a U.S. private think tank said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Kenneth Lieberthal, a China expert at the Brookings

National Committee on American Foreign Policy, told a press
conference at the end of a three-day visit to Taiwan that dialogue

disputes are what Washington has pressed for all along.</P>
      <P>He appealed for a stop to the arms race between Taiwan and
mainland China, which he said would ease the strains across the
Taiwan Strait, but denied that his delegation has tried to broker a

      <P>Visiting El Salvador President Francisco
Guillermo Flores decorated Thursday his Republic of China
counterpart, President Chen Shui-bian with the Jose Martias Delgado
Cross gold order in recognition of Chen's contribution to promoting
bilateral relations between the two nations.</P>
      <P>The decoration ceremony took place during a banquet that Chen
hosted in Flores' honor at the Presidential Office. Flores also
conferred Jose Martias Delgado Cross silver orders on both Premier
Chang Chun-hsiung and Foreign Affairs Minister Tien Hung-mao.</P>
      <P>Chen thanked Flores, saying that the medals -- El Salvador's
highest civil honor for foreigners, is not only a great honor for him
but also a symbol of the solid relations between the ROC and the
Central American country.</P>
      <P>Flores and his entourage of 26 arrived in Taipei Wednesday at the
start of a four-day state visit to the ROC.</P>
      <P>Chen spoke highly of Flores' able leadership, saying that this is
the reason behind El Salvador's progress.</P>
      <P>He told his guests that the ROC, after achieving economic
prosperity and implementing a democratic system, is now seeking to
join international organizations so as to make a greater contribution
as a member of the international community. He added that he hopes El
Salvador will continue rendering its firm support to the ROC in this
regard.</P>
      <P>While presiding over a military ceremony to greet Flores earlier
in the day, Chen said that the ROC treasures its 60-plus-year
friendship with El Salvador.</P>
      <P>Chen, who took office in Taiwan's first democratic transfer of
power between different political parties in May, also stressed the
continuity of ROC foreign policy.</P>
      <P>He said the ROC government will honor all bilateral promises and
obligations under treaties and agreements with El Salvador. "We'll
also continue upgrading relations and cooperation with El Salvador
based on current foundations," he added.</P>
      <P>He further said the ROC will consider favorably a request for
agricultural technology assistance presented by Salvadoran Vice
President Carlos Quintanilla Schmidt during a visit he made to Taiwan
in October.</P>
      <P>For his part, Flores said El Salvador appreciates the ROC's
assistance in its economic and agricultural development over past
decades. "We look forward to further strengthening our cooperation in
various fields in the future," he added.</P>
      <P>After the welcoming ceremony, the two heads of the state held
talks on a range of issues at the ROC Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>During their talks, Chen assured Flores that the ROC is more than
willing to share its developmental experiences with El Salvador and
promote bilateral cooperation in investment, trade, culture and
science/technology development to cope with the challenges of the
"new economy" era.</P>
      <P>They also exchanged views on regional and global situations. Chen
said the ROC wants to work together with all of its diplomatic allies
under bilateral or multilateral cooperative frameworks for boosting
economic, sci-tech and cultural development and jointly create a
peaceful, free and stable new century.</P>
      <P>President earlier in the day met Premier Chang Chun-hsiung to
exchange views on matters of mutual concerns. Before leaving

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN IS FAVORITE TOURISM DESTINATION FOR MAINLANDERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Dec.  8  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan is the most popular holiday
destination for mainland Chinese citizens who have the opportunity to
travel abroad, a Beijing survey showed.</P>
      <P>According to sources from the mainland Chinese State Council's
Taiwan Affairs Office, which quoted a survey recently conducted by
related agencies, Taiwan is the place that most mainland Chinese
people most want to visit abroad.</P>
      <P>Another survey conducted even more recently by the Beijing-based
Straits Travel Agency showed that some 25 million mainlanders will
register to travel to Taiwan if the Republic of China government
officially opens its tourism market to citizens of mainland China
next June.</P>
      <P>Members of China's tourism industry have already begun jostling
for position in attaining a share of the Taiwan-bound tourist market
since the ROC Legislative Yuan amended related statutes on Dec. 5
easing existing restrictions and allowing mainland Chinese citizens
to travel, trade, and teach legally in Taiwan, hopefully beginning in
June next year.</P>
      <P>A Straits Travel official said that although the opening of
Taiwan to mainland tourists seems promising and highly attractive to
mainland tourism operators, he is not that optimistic Taiwan will
actually implement the plans any time soon. He said his view is based
on his observations of Taiwan's opening itself up to allow mainland
Chinese journalists to be permanently stationed in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Members of the Taiwan-based tourism industry have also expressed
welcome for the plan to open the island up to mainland tourists, with
some calling it "the last spring" for the sagging industry.</P>
      <P>According to Tseng Sheng-hai, chairman of the Taipei Association
of Travel Agents, if Taiwan received 1 million mainland Chinese
tourists a year, it would help generate NT$100 billion (US$3 billion)
in revenue for Taiwan. His calculation is based on the assumption
that each visitor from the mainland would spend an average of
NT$100,000 during the course of an average 10-day visit.</P>
      <P>Tseng suggested that the ROC government repeal the existing
regulation mandating that each mainland visitor coming to Taiwan have
a guarantor formally guarantees that the visitor will return to the
mainland as scheduled and not attempt to remain in Taiwan. He
suggested that the government instead collect a cash deposit from
each tourist to guarantee their return to mainland China.</P>
      <P>In related news, a Taiwan tourism promotion group, to be led by
Democratic Progressive Party Legislator Wang Tuo and two other DPP
lawmakers, may cancel their scheduled trip to Beijing set to begin
Dec. 30 as the Beijing authorities have still not granted visas for
the DPP legislators.</P>
      <P>Wang said he and the other members of the group, which also
includes several legislators from the opposition parties and some 300
members from Taiwan's tourism industry, are planning to visit the
mainland to gain a better understanding of how receptive Beijing
authorities have become regarding Taiwan opening itself up to
mainland Chinese tourists.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC, FRANCE TO STRENGTHEN COOPERATION IN IPR PROTECTION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  8  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China and France pledged
Friday to further strengthen cooperation in intellectual property
rights (IPR) protection, particularly claims on patent/trademark
priority rights.</P>
      <P>The ROC's Intellectual Property Office (IPO) under the Ministry
of Economic Affairs and France's national institute of intellectual
property INPI made the vow in a joint press statement issued at the
end of a seminar on IPR protection.</P>
      <P>IPO Director Chen Ming-pang and INPI Director Daniel Hangard
co-chaired the seminar in Taipei, which was attended by judges,
prosecutors, and officials in charge of IPR affairs in the two
countries.</P>
      <P>Chen said the IPO and the INPI have strengthened bilateral
relationship through regular exchanges of information and annual
meetings, which take place alternatively in France and in Taiwan,
since the two sides signed an agreement in 1996 on mutual granting of
a priority right with regards to patents, designs and trademarks.</P>
      <P>Chen said the two offices agreed to further improve
protection of their nationals' claims on patent/trademark
priority rights during their last meeting held in Cognac, France on
Oct. 23, 2000.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, the two sides further agreed at Friday's
seminar to amend their original agreement, pending the completion of
the domestic procedures of each side, so as to permit the following
applications:</P>
      <P>-- The INPI will accept that ROC nationals who have filed
patent/trademark applications in third countries maintaining
reciprocal arrangements with the IPO will be able to claim
patent/trademark priority rights in France, and vice versa.</P>
      <P>-- The IPO and the INPI recognize that both ROC and French
national's applications filing based on the international treaties,
such as the Hague Treaty, can claim priority in each territory.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the two sides also agreed that the mechanism on
exchange of information between the IPO and the INPI will be
further strengthened. Both sides agreed to discuss relevant details
subsequently.</P>
      <P>During the seminar, the French delegates also introduced France's
and other European countries' IPR protection frameworks and shared
their experience in anti-counterfeiting and trademark disputes
handling.</P>
      <P>The French delegation was headed by Ambroise Auge, INPI deputy
director in charge of legal and public affairs. LVMH Group's senior
executives in charge of Asia-Pacific anti-counterfeiting operations
also attended the seminar.</P>
      <P>The two sides also agreed that the next IPO-INPI annual meeting
will be held in Taiwan in late 2001.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SINGAPORE AIRLINES PILOTS TO BE RELEASED NEXT WEEK</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  8  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taoyuan District Prosecutors Office
announced Friday that the three pilots of the Singapore Airlines
passenger jetliner that crashed in October while taking off from the
wrong runway at Chiang Kai-shek International Airport will be
released on Dec. 15.</P>
      <P>Whether the three SIA pilots will be prosecuted for the crash
that killed 83 of the 179 people aboard the jumbo jet that took off
in stormy weather will be decided after investigations into the
accident are completed, the prosecutors said in a formal statement.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors pointed out that reports by several foreign wire
service agencies saying that the Taoyuan District Prosecutors Office
has decided to prosecute the trio were apparently due to a
misunderstanding.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors also denied that they decided to release the SIA
pilots because of pressure from abroad, which includes threats from a
spokesman for the Singapore Chapter of the International Federation
of Airline Pilots Associations that the group will consider an
unprecedented boycott of Taiwan's airspace if the pilots are not
freed soon.</P>
      <P>The pilots -- flight commander Capt. Foong Chee Kong, 41, a
Malaysian, and Singaporean co-pilots Latif Cyrano, 36, and Ng Kheng
Leng, 38 -- were taken into custody by Taoyuan police the day of the
crash. CKS International Airport is located in Taoyuan County in
northern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors said the pilots will be handed over to
Singapore's representative office in Taiwan on Dec. 15. It has also
been learned that Singapore Airlines will arrange for the trio to
return to Singapore the same day.</P>
      <P>They noted, however, that the Singapore representative office is
obliged to make sure the pilots return to Taipei when they are again
needed for investigations.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors added that the Republic of China is a sovereign
state and judicial rights are part of its sovereignty. "The
prosecutors' judicial rights are by no means to be interfered with by
any other force," they stressed.</P>

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian signed papers
Friday granting amnesty to 21 prisoners in a move supposed to uphold
human rights, according to sources from the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>The amnesty, the first of its kind since Chen took office May 20,
is scheduled to take effect Dec. 10, World Human Rights Day, the
sources said.</P>
      <P>The president decided to grant the amnesty in accordance with a
joint assessment contributed by the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of
Justice and the Ministry of National Defense and in consideration of
human rights protection, said Presidential Secretary-General Yu
Shyi-kun.</P>
      <P>The 21 inmates include 19 men jailed for refusing to engage in
military service for religious reasons, one jailed for leading a
labor union demonstration, and one imprisoned for attempted robbery
and homicide.</P>
      <P>Members of the legislative caucus of the opposition Kuomintang
said they respect Chen's decision to grant the amnesty, a
presidential right empowered by the Constitution, but they added that
the president should pay more attention to Taiwan's deteriorating
social order and spearhead moves to bolster security and restore
order to society.</P>
      <P>Ting Shou-chung, a KMT heavyweight at the Legislative Yuan, said
Chen's amnesty is no more than a political public relations ploy that
fails to address the real needs of society.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC, EGYPT TO EXCHANGE REPRESENTATIVE OFFICES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 8 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China and Egypt have agreed
to exchange representative offices, which the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs (MOFA) described Friday as a breakthrough in Taiwan's
diplomatic offensive.</P>
      <P>The ministry said in a press release that the move was designed
to cope with growing trade and cultural exchanges between the two
countries.</P>
      <P>This is the first time that the ROC and Egypt have managed to
forge official ties since Cairo switched diplomatic recognition from
Taipei to Beijing in 1956.</P>
      <P>Foreign Minister Tien Hung-mao said Egypt's consent to exchange
representative offices with Taiwan marks an important step forward in
the ROC's diplomatic work in view of Cairo's pivotal role in Africa
and the Arab world.</P>
      <P>"Despite the absence of formal diplomatic relations, the exchange
of representative offices between our two countries is of great
significance," Tien stressed.</P>
      <P>He said the ROC has sent officials to Cairo to prepare for the
opening of its representative office, which will be officially named
the "Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in Egypt."</P>
      <P>Saying that Egypt is "no ordinary country," Tien said MOFA will
dispatch a competent senior official familiar with African and Arab
affairs to serve as the ROC's first de facto ambassador in that
country.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Tien went on, Egypt is also expected to send an
ambassadorial-level official to head its representative office in the
ROC, to be named the "Egyptian Office for Trade and Culture in
Taipei."</P>
      <P>If all goes smoothly, Tien said, the two countries will be able
to complete the establishment of representative offices in each
other's territory before the end of this year.</P>
      <P>Tien noted that Egypt is an old country with a long history and a
marvelous cultural heritage. In 1999, more than 10,000 ROC nationals
made sightseeing tours of Egypt.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Tien continued, bilateral commercial exchanges have
grown steadily since Egypt began privatization and other economic
reforms in 1991. Two-way trade between Taiwan and Egypt exceeded
US$200 million last year.</P>
      <P>Up until now, the two countries have not opened any offices to
handle visa and relevant affairs, causing inconvenience and trouble
to business people and tourists.</P>
      <P>"Therefore, we have been seeking to forge substantive ties with
Egypt to facilitate bilateral trade, economic and cultural
exchanges," Tien said.</P>
      <P>The minister further said that as Egypt understands that the ROC
is widely recognized as one of the world's trade, investment and
economic powerhouses and that its people have strong purchasing power
and like to go abroad for sightseeing, it is willing to develop
closer ties with the ROC.</P>
      <P>Egypt has traditionally maintained friendly relations with
mainland China. Tien said the ROC will not interfere with Egypt's
engagements with Beijing nor will it pay special concern to Beijing's
possible reaction to Cairo's decision to exchange representative
offices with Taipei.</P>
      <P>Tien said he is convinced that Egypt has evaluated all relevant
political issues in its decision-making process concerning the
exchange of representative offices with the ROC.</P>
      <P>He said Egypt's move is by no means an indication that it is
unfriendly toward Beijing. "Relations among countries around the
world hinge on reciprocity and mutual benefit, not on a zero-sum
game," he noted.</P>
      <P>Diplomatic sources said Tao Wen-lung, director of the MOFA's
African Affairs Department, is likely to be the ROC's first
representative to Egypt.</P>

      <P>Republic of China Premier Chang Chun-hsiung
said Friday that the government will consider easing its cross-Taiwan
Strait policy, as long as national security can be assured.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks to reporters in response to a suggestion by
the Science and Technology Advisory Group of the Executive Yuan at
its 21st meeting that ended Friday that the government should adopt a
strategy of economic globalization and readjust its "go slow, be
patient" policy in dealing with investment in mainland China.</P>
      <P>Chang said that within the scope of national security, the
government will consider adjusting the "go slow, be patient" policy
and the "three direct links" -- direct trade, postal and
transportation links.</P>
      <P>Academia Sinica President Lee Yuan-tseh, chief advisor of the
group, also pointed out the need for easing the "go slow, be patient"
policy under the present trend of economic globalization.</P>
      <P>This year, the Science and Technology Advisory Group carried out
its projects with the theme of "developing Taiwan into a green
silicon island."</P>
      <P>Priority has also been given to environmental protection,
development of intellectual economy and improvement of social
justice.</P>
      <P>The group called on the government to continue promoting the use
of broad-band Internet, the re-training of unemployed workers and
enhanced development of potential industries such as software design,
bio-tech information, information technology and communications, and
semiconductors.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Francisco Guillermo Flores Perez
of El Salvador urged all countries around the world Friday to resolve
their disputes through peaceful negotiations in line with
international law.</P>
      <P>Flores, who is currently on a four-day state visit to the
Republic of China, made the appeal in an address to the ROC's
Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>In his speech, Flores also said El Salvador attaches great
importance to its diplomatic relations and cooperative programs with
the ROC.</P>
      <P>Flores said the ROC-Central America Mixed Committee provides a
useful dialogue mechanism and has thus helped boost bilateral and
multilateral exchanges and cooperation between Taiwan and its Central
American diplomatic allies.</P>
      <P>ROC lawmakers from both ruling and opposition parties, as well as
Legislative Yuan staff members, turned out to welcome Flores and
listen to his speech, which was delivered in Spanish.</P>
      <P>Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng said Flores' visit was
an honor for the ROC legislators and marked a further step forward in
Taiwan-El Salvador relations.</P>
      <P>The ROC forged diplomatic ties with El Salvador nearly 70 years
ago and the two countries now maintain trade, agricultural,
technological and cultural cooperative programs. The legislative
bodies of the two countries forged cooperative ties in 1992.</P>
      <P>Later in the day, Flores paid a visit to Talin Hospital in
southern Taiwan's Chiayi County in the company of ROC President Chen
Shui-bian. The newly opened hospital is operated by Master Cheng
Yen's Buddhist Compassionate Relief Tzu Chi Foundation.</P>
      <P>Master Cheng Yen led a group of Tzu Chi volunteers in welcoming
the Salvadoran leader. Flores expressed his gratitude for Tzu Chi's
donation of relief goods to El Salvador more than two years when the
country was hit by a devastating hurricane.</P>
      <P>This is Flores' second visit to Taiwan. He will co-sign a joint
communique with Chen Saturday to reaffirm the countries' commitment
to furthering bilateral relations and cooperation.</P>
      <P>Flores is accompanied by his wife, Foreign Minister Maria Eugenia

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN HUMAN RIGHTS STILL NEED IMPROVEMENT: REPORT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  8 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's human rights index shows signs of
decline in almost all sectors of society this year, except for the
judicial sector, the Chinese Association for Human Rights (CAHR)
reported Friday.</P>
      <P>According to the CAHR annual report released Friday, Taiwan has
made little progress in improving its human rights in 2000.</P>
      <P>The report shows that women's rights have not made any
significant progress this year, while children's right flunk for the
fourth consecutive year.</P>
      <P>There were no adequate nursing facilities or government policy
for the elderly in Taiwan, with public care for the elderly in
southern and eastern Taiwan falling behind the levels given to old
people in northern and central Taiwan, according to the report.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the report indicates, the overall political rights
index dropped to below the three-point approval rate this year when
more than 200 scholars and experts surveyed for the report found that
people had less inclination to fight government officials for their
rights and met more difficulties when applying for licenses.</P>
      <P>The respondents said the media's justice and respect for the
people involved in news events were increasingly doubtful and they
found that concerns about the existence of vested-interest groups in
society and unjustifiably poor performances of lawmakers dropped to
the worst-ever levels.</P>
      <P>In terms of the lowered index for economic rights, the
respondents noted that public power has invaded the private economic

the opposition parties' boycott moves against the government for

    <HEADLINE>NOBEL LAUREATE PITCHES FOR END TO POLITICAL WRANGLING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  8  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Academia Sinica President Lee Yuan-tseh
pitched for an end to domestic political wrangling Friday, saying
Taiwan cannot afford a continued war of attrition.</P>
      <P>Lee, a co-winner of the 1986 Nobel Prize in chemistry, made the
appeal in a news conference held at the conclusion of a
five-day meeting of the Science and Technology Advisory Group of the
Executive Yuan, or Cabinet. Lee is the top adviser of the group.</P>
      <P>Noting that the current Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)-led
government should take the greatest share of blame for a crisis of
confidence now simmering in the country, Lee said other domestic
political parties and all ordinary people should work together with
the government to overcome various challenges and obstacles to
Taiwan's pursuit of economic globalization.</P>
      <P>In fact, Lee said, Taiwan is not alone in suffering an economic
slowdown which he said is almost a worldwide phenomenon. According
to Lee, the global economy is undergoing significant changes. "Taiwan
has not yet fully readied itself for all new developments. We should
make an overall review and step up reforms to cope with new
challenges," he noted.</P>
      <P>During the five-day meeting of sci-tech advisers, Lee said,
globalization was a hot topic. "As globalization is key to the
development of knowledge-based 'new economy,' local industries
should be given full freedom to chart their global production,
investment and marketing plans," Lee explained, adding that Taiwan
itself should also keep its door open to foreign investors.</P>
      <P>Lee said most of sci-tech advisers support the proposal that
Taiwan ease its restrictions on investment in mainland China under
its "no haste, be patient" policy.</P>
      <P>In his view, Lee said, the exodus of Taiwan industries
may not necessarily be a detriment to the island. "So long as
outbound investment can help expand a company's global market share
and enhance competitiveness, the trend can be a boon to Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Under a global development strategy, Lee said, continued
upgrading of research and development (R&amp;D) capabilities hold the key
to Taiwan's survival and sustainable growth.</P>
      <P>Lee said the focus of sci-tech advisory meeting was not the
"exodus of Taiwan industries. "The advisers focused discussion on
whether Taiwan can foster a better investment climate to enable its
companies to produce even higher value-added products and
further upgrade R&amp;D capabilities," he added.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, although many Taiwan technology companies
relocate to mainland China, most of them have just moved
production lines to the mainland while retaining their R&amp;D and
design centers in Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>RULING, OPPOSITION LEGISLATORS RESUME DIALOGUE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  8 (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Ruling and opposition legislative caucuses
reopened unofficial channels Friday in order to begin the monumental
task of amending a series of complicated laws on which certain
executive powers are based.</P>
      <P>A portion of the amendments to the Administrative Procedural Law
giving a temporary one-year extension for those powers passed a third
reading earlier in the day. Two identical versions were voted on --
one from the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and another
from the opposition alliance of the Kuomintang (KMT), the People
First Party (PFP) and the New Party (NP) -- due to the fact that the
two camps are not speaking to each other.</P>
      <P>The DPP and the opposition parties have broken off all official
communication channels since Premier Chang Chun-hsiung of the DPP
made a sudden announcement at the end of October that a decision had
been made to scrap the controversial fourth nuclear power plant
project.</P>
      <P>Presently, a backlog of over 30 related amendments is awaiting
review by the legislature, but the Administrative Procedural Law is
set to be promulgated into law Jan. 1, 2001. If the related
amendments are not completed in time, over 100 executive order powers
will lose their legal basis, thus making it urgent for a compromise
to define a grace period for those powers to retain their legality.</P>
      <P>Due to the enormity of working out the amendments, the separate
camps in the legislature agreed to the Cabinet's urgings and decided
to allow the grace period while the lawmakers define the various
kinds of executive orders, in particular the "authority of office"
subtypes.</P>
      <P>According to reports, however, neither the Cabinet nor the
legislature are optimistic about being able to complete all the
amendments within one year. Therefore, a corollary to the amendment
passed Friday allows the Cabinet to extend the grace period -- with
the legislature's consent -- one month before the time limit is up.</P>
      <P>However, KMT Legislator Liu Kuang-hua and NP Legislator Hsieh
Chi-ta criticized the amendment for giving too much power to the
Cabinet.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN'S SEMICONDUCTOR GROUP TO INVEST IN MAINLAND CHINA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Dec.   8   (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Criticizing the Republic of China
government's "no haste, be patient" policy toward investment in
mainland China, a local semiconductor group has announced that it
will establish a plant in Shanghai to gain a better foothold in this
giant market.</P>
      <P>Jason Chang, board chairman of Advanced Semiconductor Engineering
Group, said Friday in a radio interview that the "no haste, be
patient" policy is an anachronism, adding that Taiwan should take the
initiative in dissolving cross-strait hostilities by allowing local
enterprises to invest in the mainland so as to maintain their
competitiveness.</P>
      <P>He said that mainland China has actively promoted its economy in
recent years and now offers preferential conditions for semiconductor
manufacturers, thereby attracting numerous firms, including Motorola
and Philips, to invest there.</P>
      <P>Chang went on that Taiwan's lifeline is in high-tech industries,
but because of its limited market, almost 90 percent of its
electronics must be exported. "However, whoever wants to be the No. 1
enterprise in the world has to take on the mainland China market,"
Chang said.</P>
      <P>He indicated that the government should abandon ideological
arguments and let local companies decide their own future.</P>
      <P>Although mainland China is still some three to five years behind
Taiwan in semiconductor and wafer manufacturing, other international
firms are actively positioning themselves in the market, Chang said.
He warned that Taiwan may lose its advantage soon.</P>
      <P>Trying to ease government misgivings about Taiwanese investment
in mainland China, Chang noted that after leading firms such as IBM
and Philips invested in Taiwan, their partners here did not attempt
to co-opt their market positions. On the contrary, their relations
have been mutually beneficial, he said.</P>
      <P>Chang added that it is already late to invest in some sectors of
mainland China's market, but opportunities still exist.</P>
      <P>He cited the activities of Winston Wang, son of Taiwan tycoon
Wang Yung-ching, who recently announced that he was setting up a
large-scale wafer plant in mainland China in cooperation with the son
of President Jiang Zemin.</P>
      <P>Chang noted that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. did
not establish factories in mainland China because of the ROC
government's policy, which let other firms seize the opportunity. He
said that such firms would likely become major rivals for the
semiconductor giant.</P>
      <P>Chang said he does not want to ever see his company miss out on
such an opportunity.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC PROFESSOR SELECTED FELLOW OF THIRD WORLD ACADEMY OF SCIENCES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  8  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Professor Reuben Jih-ru Hwu of National
Tsinghua University has been selected a fellow of the Third World
Academy of Sciences (TWAS) for his outstanding achievements in
chemistry studies, local academic sources said Friday.</P>
      <P>Hwu, also a professor with the Institute of Chemistry of Academia
Sinica, the Republic of China's highest research body, is a noted
synthetic chemist. He has won international recognition with
innovative contributions to organosilicon chemistry.</P>
      <P>His research areas also cover natural product synthesis, new
reactions and new reagent, synthetic methods and concepts,
mechanistic studies, drug design and synthesis, molecular genomics
and polymer science.</P>
      <P>Hwu, 46, said he felt honored to become a TWAS fellow. Noting
that the TWAS is an important international non-governmental
organization, with participants from the United States, Europe,
Asia, Africa and other parts of the world, Hwu said TWAS operations
have not encountered too much political interference.</P>
      <P>Hwu said the ROC should forge closer contacts with the TWAS to
break bottlenecks in its science-technology exchanges with other
countries.</P>
      <P>According to Hwu, the TWAS once helped the ROC break mainland
China's diplomatic embargo and resolve some problems with the
United Nations concerning the U.N. ban on chemical weapons.</P>
      <P>Hwu was one of the 35 new TWAS fellows selected at the
organization's latest biennial meeting held in Tehran, Iran
last week.</P>
      <P>The Italy-based TWAS was broached by a group of renowned scholars
from around the world in 1983 and formally inaugurated in 1985 with
the support of the United Nations. It maintains close ties with
UNESCO.</P>
      <P>The TWAS now has 543 fellows from 75 countries, including many
Nobel Prize laureates. Its fellows include outstanding Third World
scientists and Third World immigrants to advanced countries.</P>
      <P>In addition to Hwu, several other ROC scholars were already
selected TWAS fellows in the past few years, including Academia
Sinica President Lee Yuan-tseh, who was also a co-winner of the 1986
Nobel Prize in chemistry, and Chou Chang-hung, president of National
Sun Yat-sen University.</P>

    <HEADLINE>REPORT ON TAIWAN PATIENT RIGHTS RELEASED</HEADLINE>

(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition New Party (NP) legislator Hau
Lung-bin released a report Friday on the rights of Taiwan medical
patients, and urged for the passage of a Basic Medical Rights Law to
clearly define such rights.</P>
      <P>Hau, the NP's national convener, said that the patient rights
issue should be addressed through the system by establishing equal
doctor-patient relations and passing a law to ensure that neither
patients nor medical personnel ignore their respective rights and
duties.</P>
      <P>According to the report, which was compiled by the Republic of
China Association for the Advancement of Patient Rights, Taiwan has
always been found to be lacking in terms of medical rights. The
association noted that although the Department of Health is working
on a law to resolve medical disputes, controversy still exists
regarding its limitations and its proposed complaint channels.</P>
      <P>In regards to medical education and professional self-discipline,
the association noted that no Taiwan medical school has set up a
full-scale curriculum on either patient rights or medical ethics.
What's more, the association continued, professional organizations
have never taken any active measures on the issue and have not
applied internal discipline to cases in which doctors invaded the
privacy of patients.</P>
      <P>The association criticized the media for creating too much
publicity for certain doctors, which it claimed gave patients
"excessive expectations." It urged the media to provide more
reporting aimed at balancing out "unequal" doctor-patient relations.</P>
      <P>According to the association, the report was based on a set of
evaluation guidelines established by the World Health Organization in
1994.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The boss of Taiwan's Taiwan Semiconductor
Manufacturing Co. (TSMC), the world's largest foundry semiconductor
maker, said Friday that his firm will not invest in mainland China
during the next five years.</P>
      <P>TSMC head Morris Chang made the remark in reaction to speculation
that his firm intends to march into mainland China in light of
Chang's recent call for loosening the government's "no hurry, be
patient" trade policy toward the mainland and his mainland China
visit planned for next Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chang said he actually just wants to attend an international
bridge tournament in Beijing, and does not intend to meet with
mainland Chinese authorities on investment affairs.</P>
      <P>Specifically, he denied a rumor that he intends to meet with
Zhang Qi, director of the Department of Economic and Information
Products Management under mainland China's Ministry of Information
Technology and Telecom Industries. Zhang is now visiting Taiwan at
the head of a 10-member mainland Chinese delegation.</P>
      <P>Although he said TSMC will not enter mainland China for the next
five years, Chang stressed that Taiwan high-tech manufacturers
investing and setting up factories in the mainland will be an
unavoidable trend in the future. He urged the government to come to
grips with the trend as early as possible, and remove the ban on
making major investments in mainland China.</P>

    <HEADLINE>COMMANDER OF US 7TH FLEET HOPES CROSS STRAIT DIALOGUE TO BE RESUMED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Hong Kong, Dec. 8 (CNA)
(By Stanley Cheung &amp; Ed Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice Adm. James Metzger, commander of the
U.S. Seventh Fleet, has said he hopes that the dialogue between
Taiwan and mainland China will be resumed soon.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks in an interview at the Foreign Press Club in
Hong Kong Friday, in which he touched on issues related to
cross-strait relations, the Spratly Islands and the Korean peninsula.</P>
      <P>Metzger said that the stance of the United States government is
to encourage the two sides of the Taiwan Strait to resume their
dialogue. He spoke highly of the Republic of China's presidential
election and described it as "positive."</P>
      <P>Although U.S. forces under his command are capable of reaching
the Taiwan Strait very quickly, he said he does not expect that it
will be necessary. Metzger added that U.S. relations with the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait will remain unchanged.</P>
      <P>He said that the U.S. will not forget its responsibility to the
Taiwan Strait region, and to encourage a resumed dialogue between
Taiwan and mainland China is its main responsibility, Metzger said.</P>
      <P>He added that he believes such a dialogue is the only effective
way to improve cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>He did not respond to a question about whether Beijing threatens
Taiwan militarily, but reiterated that only a dialogue can resolve
the cross-strait issue.</P>
      <P>Metzger also said that containing mainland China is impossible,
so communication with Beijing is necessary to resolve disputes. He
noted that the Seventh Fleet is conducting exchanges with mainland's
navy.</P>
      <P>Mentioning the Spratly Islands issue, he said the U.S. position
toward the isles remains unchanged. The U.S. government will not
support any particular country's claim to sovereignty over the
islands, he said, adding that the United States is mainly concerned
about maintaining navigational freedom in the area.</P>
      <P>On the Korean Peninsula issue, Metzger said that the U.S. will
continue to promote talks between South and North Korea, which are
already underway.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BRICKS-MORTAR, ONLINE COMBINATION KEY TO DOTCOM SURVIVAL (I)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Dec.   8  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Amid a sweeping wave of increased
acquisitions and mergers among worldwide online firms, local Internet
experts contend that a combination between bricks and virtual
operations represents the key to continued survival for all dotcoms.</P>
      <P>Despite the surprising acquisition last month by Yahoo! of the
local portal Kimo, many local dotcom operators are of the opinion
that setting up a bricks-mortar revenue model, rather than a
virtual-virtual combination like the Yahoo-Kimo case, is pivotal to
their existence.</P>
      <P>The most well-known bricks-mortar combinations in recent years
have been the mergers between America Online and Time Warner and
between Pacific Century Cyberworks and Hongkong Telecommunications
Ltd., according to local Internet experts.</P>
      <P>Although such large-scale combinations between virtual and
traditional businesses have not yet occurred in Taiwan, the experts
say mergers between small- and medium-sized online businesses are
increasingly frequent, pointing to the recent cooperation between
inforian.com and Hewlett Packard, which through coolbid.com -- a site
run by inforian -- launched an HP fleet website.</P>
      <P>Institute for Information Industry Chairman H.M. Huang, who is a
former head of Hewlett Packard Taiwan Ltd., said in a ceremony
marking the formation of the joint venture that companies with real
distribution networks, if incorporated with Internet channels, should
be able to create revenue models for profit under a labor division
pattern.</P>
      <P>eAuto.com -- a website on car information -- also acquired two
car magazines -- Auto Driver and Auto Express -- in October. eAuto
owner C.N. Chou said that such a "bricks-mortar" consolidation will
help his website move a big step toward becoming the leading brand
among similar local sites and offer an opportunity for his business
group to embark on diversification.</P>
      <P>According to Chou, eAuto.com provides quick and efficient
information to its viewers, while the newly purchased magazines are
available for making detailed and extensive reports to their readers.
A combination of the two different types of businesses will produce a
profound cross-media platform effect, he added.</P>
      <P>At the same time, certain traditional businesses, such as Ford
Lio Ho Motor Company Ltd., have also noticed the importance of such
consolidation. The carmaker has been actively promoting a campaign
dubbed "e-order," boasting that delivering a car on the Internet
takes only 15 days.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, another major local carmaker -- Yulon Motor Co., Ltd.
-- has joined forces with cmc.taiwanet.com to create a real
distribution network to pave the way for expanding into the area of
B2C commerce.</P>
      <P>Another example is Netvista Information Corp. and Topology
Research Inc., both of which have successfully coped with a recent
shape-up among online businesses by transforming into B2B software
developers from pure B2C websites.

      <P>Starting from a B2C website -- auctions.com -- Netvista has
transformed into a B2B application service provider by launching
e-commerce software products for local small enterprises.</P>
      <P>In a move to set up a distribution network to promote its
physical products, Netvista has signed contracts with islandwide
distributors to market a package of e-commerce software products --
esafe -- which provides local businesses with comprehensive
enterprise resource planning.</P>
      <P>"I believe that a bricks-mortar combination represents the key
solution to all e-commerce websites. It is not easy to make money by
only running online businesses and an e-commerce website should play
only a supportive role for a real distribution system," says Netvista
Vice President Howard Yu.</P>
      <P>According to Yu, Netvista has acquired many orders from
downstream distributors, a situation which is expected to chalk up an
income on the company's balance sheet by the end of this year.</P>
      <P>Chief Executive Officer Charles Chen of Topology Research -- a
pioneer Internet technology service provider in Taiwan -- told CNA
that Internet software and platform systems will be his company's
mainstream products in the future.</P>
      <P>Aiming at the Internet's future trends, Topology set up an
Internet system division last year to develop a series of Internet
software products to provide its corporate customers with
across-the-board Internet, Intranet and Extranet solutions, Chen
said.</P>
      <P>In addition, Topology has also devised a much faster
third-generation search engine -- Web Genie -- to search for data and
information on the Internet, Chen noted, adding that his company has
applied for patent rights for the product's key technology -- the
first-ever in the world -- in Taiwan, the United States, Japan and
South Korea.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, Topology has also reached agreement with the
Beijing-based ACE Group, in the hope of promoting Internet software
products in mainland China, which he said is set to emerge as the
world's largest market for Internet businesses.</P>
      <P>"With the approach of the knowledge-based `new economy,' software
programs on information management are set to play a significant role
in the future. The search engine with better technology and more
value-added functions to help users upgrade their productivity will
enjoy a larger slice of the market," he explained.</P>
      <P>At a time when more and more dotcom operators are realizing the
vital importance of a bricks-mortar/virtual combination as a way of
making profits, Internet experts say only those online businesses
that know how to forge profitable business alliances or conduct
acquisitions will be able to continue to move on.</P>
      <P>Only the fittest will survive, they warn.</P>

    <DATELINE>Beijing,  Dec.  8  (CNA)
(By Chen Huang-szu and Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei and Beijing may still be mired in
disagreement over the "one China" issue, but Taiwan's airlines are
already poised to cash in on the undoubtedly lucrative Taipei-Beijing
flight route that would follow a breakthrough in bilateral talks.</P>
      <P>According to industry sources, Taiwan's China Airlines, EVA
Airways, Far East Air Transport, and TransAsia Airways have already
established regional offices in Beijing in anticipation of the
possible profits.</P>
      <P>Despite the fact that the bilateral dialogue has stalled and
neither side seems willing to budge on more sensitive political
issues, planning and preparation continue at the airlines.</P>
      <P>Although direct air links between the two capital cities may
still be a pie in the sky at this stage, Hsieh Ching-lung, EVA's
Beijing office planning director, said that initial estimates put the
potential market to be in the range of tens of billions or perhaps
even hundreds of billions of New Taiwan dollars, which is equivalent
to approximately US$3 billion to US$30 billion.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said that the number of travelers to mainland China from
Taiwan this year -- all of whom must transit in either Hong Kong or
Macau -- will exceed three million, while the number of mainlanders
who travel to Taiwan is approximately 100,000.</P>
      <P>If mainland China further opens air routes over its territory to
Taiwan carriers, the so-called "Silk Road in the Sky" will save about
two hours in flight time from Taiwan to Europe, Hsieh said.
Currently, flights from Taipei to European cities require transits in
Bangkok or other cities, driving up costs and adding to travelers'
inconvenience.</P>
      <P>According to Hsieh, the time saved by flying a direct route over
continental Asia would allow an airline to fly an additional flight
to Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>The Republic of China government has held out olive branches to
Beijing by first announcing that direct trade, postal, and
transportation links between Taiwan's outlying Kinmen and Matsu
islands and designated ports in mainland China will be established in
January, then later announcing that direct links between
Taiwan-proper and mainland Chinese cities are in the works.</P>

      <P>After a year of preparation, an organization
to benefit disadvantaged sufferers of rare diseases will be formally
set up on Sunday in Taipei, group organizers said Friday.</P>
      <P>The association will promote the rights and benefits of
underprivileged patients in Taiwan, and will be an umbrella
organization covering two dozen groups of sufferers of rare disorders
on the island, they said.</P>
      <P>Some 220 sufferers of 34 rare diseases, their physicians and
families, as well as officials from the Interior Ministry's
Department of Health will attended Sunday's inauguration ceremony,
said the organizers.</P>
      <P>Taipei City Mayor Ma Ying-jeou and Department of Health officials
have promised to attend the ceremony in person to show their support.</P>
      <P>Noting that the patients are disadvantaged because of their small
numbers and society's ignorance of their need, the organizers said
the new group will promote public awareness of the patients' misery
and their families' lonely struggle to care for them, as well as
encourage the health care system to address the sufferers' needs more
properly.</P>
      <P>The organization will also bring together the patients and their
families to support each other by sharing their experiences, said the
organizers.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PHILIPPINE  AIRLINES  HEAD SAID UNSATISFIED  WITH TAIWAN AIR PACT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  8 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Philippine Airlines Chairman Lucio Tan has
expressed his discontent over the air agreement that the Philippine
government signed with the Republic of China in September, according
to ROC Ministry of Transport and Communications (MOTC) officials.</P>
      <P>In a recent interview with Hong Kong-based AsiaWeek magazine, Tan
said the new air agreement was signed by the Philippine government
under economic pressure from the Taiwan side, and added that the deal
will result in annual losses of some US$800 million for Philippine
Airlines.</P>
      <P>Officials of the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) of MOTC
responded Friday by saying that all international air pacts are
signed under the principles of equality and the respective needs of
the signatories.</P>
      <P>There is no such thing as one side having an advantage over
another, said the officials, citing the example of Thai Airways
International, which operates fewer flights to Taiwan than those of
Taiwan airlines to Thailand.</P>
      <P>However, Thai Airways has never asked Taiwan to reduce its
flights to Thailand, because of the strong ticket sales brought on by
Thailand's healthy tourism industry, the officials added.</P>
      <P>Referring to the possible annual losses for Philippine Airlines,
the CAA officials said that customers are free to choose which
airline they wish to fly, and suggested that Philippine Airlines
improve its service to attract more customers instead of casting
blame for its losses elsewhere.</P>
      <P>With respect to the Tan's suggestion that Taiwanese airlines will
try to merge with Philippine Airlines after it goes bankrupt, the
officials said that several airlines, including Cathay Pacific,
Lufthansa and Taiwan's EVA Airways have all looked into acquiring a
piece of Philippine Airlines, but have felt that the airline does not
merit their investment.</P>
      <P>The Philippines unilaterally severed air links with Taiwan last
October because of a dispute over the division of passenger loads.
Air services between the two countries briefly resumed in January,
only to be cut by Manila a few days later over the issue of how
passenger load ratios should be calculated.</P>
      <P>After tedious negotiations, the Philippines and Taiwan resumed
air links again in October this year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NAVY:  U.S.  MISSILES  BEST MATCH FOR PERRY-CLASS FRIGATES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 8 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Navy's fleet of Chengkung-class frigates
will be one of the service's key weapons if they are armed with
U.S.-made Harpoon missiles, the Navy said Friday.</P>
      <P>In an attempt to defend its decision to replace the locally-made
Hsiung-II missiles on its Chengkung frigates with Harpoons, the Navy
said in a news briefing Friday that Harpoons are standard equipment
aboard the U.S. Perry-class frigate, on which the Chengkung vessel is
patterned.</P>
      <P>With a range of 110 miles and the capability of skimming over the
sea at supersonic speed, the Harpoon is a more powerful weapon than
the Hsiung-II for the 3000-ton Perry frigate, said the Navy.</P>
      <P>The Hsiung-II missile will instead be used by the Navy's
Chinchiang-class gunboat, which has a displacement of 500 tons, said
the Navy.</P>
      <P>The Navy is trying to seek the legislature's support for the
NT$600 million (US$18.18 million) budget earmarked for the purchase
of the Harpoons from the United States.</P>
      <P>Revelations of the formerly secret budget caused an outcry at the
Legislative Yuan Thursday, because the General Staff Headquarters
(GSH) had not yet approved the purchase of the Harpoons.</P>
      <P>Angry legislators accused the Navy of trying to muddle through
with an unauthorized arms purchase.</P>
      <P>The Navy's Vice General Staff Lei Kuan-shui explained at a press
briefing Friday that Washington had refused to sell Harpoons to
Taipei when it agreed to allow Taiwan to build eight frigates based
on the model of the Perry-class vessel in the early 1990s.</P>
      <P>As a consequence, Taiwan was forced to make do by installing its
home-made Hsiung-II missile on the frigates, of which seven are now
in service.</P>
      <P>However, Washington reversed its decision and granted Taipei's
request for Harpoon purchases in September, after Beijing took
delivery of its second Russia-made Sovremenny-class destroyer --
which could tilt the military balance across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Grasping at the long-awaited chance, the Navy cut normal
procurement procedures and added the down payment of NT$600 million
for the NT$1.1 billion deal to its budget. But the proposal was
rejected by the General Staff Headquarters on the grounds that
standard procedures were not followed.</P>
      <P>Lei admitted that the NT$600 million set aside for the purchase
was not stricken from the Navy's budget, which was compiled before
the GSH rejection. He added that the funds would not be available for
use even if the request passed through the legislature without being
detected.</P>
      <P>He apologized for the negligence, but vociferously defended the
Navy's decision to buy Harpoon missiles.</P>
      <P>Given the fact that it would take 18 months to deploy the
missile, Lei appealed for the legislature's support for the purchase,
which will be added to the Navy's revised 2000 budget according to
established procedures and resubmitted for approval later.</P>
      <P>Any delay acquiring the missiles would compromise the Navy's
capability to counter Beijing's naval might after 2004, warned Lei.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC FINANCE MINISTER EXPLAINS POLICIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New  York,  Dec.  8  (CNA)
(By Eric C.Y. Tseng and Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Finance Minister Yen
Ching-chang said in a recent interview with U.S.-based BusinessWeek
Online that the ROC government is working to improve the asset
quality of its banking sector and is encouraging consolidation.</P>
      <P>According to the Dec. 11 online issue of the prestigious business
weekly, there are signs that Taiwan may be on the brink of a
financial crisis despite its strong electronics sector and other
positive economic indicators.</P>
      <P>The New York Times and The Economist have recently published
similar reports, drawing defensive responses from Taiwan's Central
Bank of China and Ministry of Finance, whose official figures put the
nation's non-performing loans (NPLs) at about 5.6 percent of the
Gross Domestic Product. Foreign analysts have estimated that the NPL
ratio may be as high as 15 percent.</P>
      <P>Yen told BusinessWeek Online that Taiwan has a healthy trade
surplus, foreign reserves of more than US$110 billion and low
government debt. However, he admitted that the average NPL ratio has
grown from 3.7 percent at the end of 1997 to 5.35 percent at the end
of September for commercial banks. "I don't think we've hit the peak
yet," he added.</P>
      <P>Other than passing a new bank merger law on Nov. 25 that will
also make it easier for banks to dispose of bad loans, Yen said that
the government is reducing the gross revenue tax from 5 percent to 2
percent in a gradual process that will lead to its final elimination,
which he said will allow banks to use the money saved on taxes to
write off bad loans.</P>
      <P>To create an alternative channel for banks to dispose of NPLs
other than going to the courts, which can take three to five years,
Yen said that he is "pushing very hard" for the creation of a
domestic asset-management company (AMC) within three months to buy
and sell problem loans. He added that he has been approached by a
number of foreign companies, including Goldman Sachs and GE Capital,
in this regard.</P>
      <P>Former U.S. Vice President Dan Quayle, who works for Cerberus
Capital Management, the world's largest investor in distressed debt,
also visited Taiwan in late November to help Cerberus find local
partners to set up an AMC.</P>
      <P>With 53 banks and nearly 360 non-bank financial institutions such
as farmers credit cooperatives in Taiwan, Yen said that the three
biggest banks have a comparatively low market share of 26 percent.
"We need to encourage consolidation," he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SEF EXECUTIVES VISIT KINMEN AMID PREPARATIONS FOR `MINI LINKS'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kinmen, Dec. 9 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF)
executives visited the Republic of China's frontline island of Kinmen
Saturday amid the ROC's intensified preparations for the scheduled
opening of direct "mini three links" with mainland China.</P>
      <P>SEF Deputy Secretary-General Yen Wan-chin, head of the group,
said upon his arrival at the defense outpost that opening direct
trade, postal and shipping links between the ROC-held outlying
islands of Kinmen and Matsu and mainland China's Xiamen and Mawei in
Fujian Province on Jan. 1, 2001 is the government's established
policy.</P>
      <P>"Even if the Beijing authorities continue resisting talks with us
on the `mini three links' issue, the policy will be implemented as
scheduled," Yen stressed.</P>
      <P>Authorized by the ROC government, Yen went on, the SEF is ready
to talk with Beijing's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Strait (ARATS) on the "mini three links" issue.</P>
      <P>The SEF and ARATS are quasi-official intermediary bodies mandated
by their respective governments to handle cross-strait exchanges in
the absence of official ties.</P>
      <P>"We have not yet given up hope of holding face-to-face
discussions with ARATS officials on `mini three links' issues before
the end of this year," Yen said, adding that the SEF will also be
willing to negotiate with ARATS even after the direct "mini three
links" are opened at the beginning of the new year.</P>
      <P>Touching on the Kinmen County Government's hope that both the SEF
and ARATS will post officials on Kinmen to help deal with commercial
disputes, travel services and criminal activities that may arise
after the opening of direct links with Xiamen, Yen said the SEF has
already finalized a plan to set up a branch office in Kinmen to
facilitate services for Kinmen and Xiamen residents.</P>
      <P>"Once the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC), which
oversees SEF operations, approves the plan, the SEF will dispatch
staff members to operate its Kinmen branch office," Yen said.</P>
      <P>During their Saturday meeting, Kinmen County Magistrate Chen
Shui-tsai told Yen that he plans to head a delegation of Kinmen
officials and civic representatives on a direct maiden voyage to
Xiamen aboard two county government ferries on Jan. 1.</P>
      <P>"We hope the SEF can send staff members to join us on the planned
four-day ice-breaking visit," Chen said, adding that his mission also
plans to bring back a number of elderly Xiamen residents to their
Kinmen homeland so that they can pay their respects to their
ancestors. The old people have been stranded in the Xiamen area for
more than 50 years since the Chinese civil war in the 1940s.</P>
      <P>In response, Yen said Chen's "two-way" traffic links plan still
involves many technical problems that must be resolved through
SEF-ARATS discussions. "We have prepared a detailed agenda for
bilateral negotiations, but we cannot reveal it at this moment," he
added.</P>
      <P>Yen further said that if Beijing remains reluctant to return to
the negotiating table, Taiwan will be forced to implement one-way
trade and shipping links with the mainland in the initial stage,
including legalizing "small-amount" trading between Kinmen and Xiamen
fishermen, which in fact has been going on illegally for years.
Kinmen lies far closer to Xiamen than to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The SEF delegation also paid a visit to the Kinmen Defense
Headquarters to discuss measures for ensuring national security
following the opening of the "mini three links."</P>
      <P>On Sunday, the group is scheduled to inspect Liaolo Port, which
will be used for the direct Kinmen-Xiamen shipping services, and the
Hsinhu fishing port, which will be used as a cross-strait fishing
trade center in the second stage of the "mini three links."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A local industry leader said
Saturday that he will make recommendations to the Economics Ministry
to promote the establishment of a special trade and economics zone to
be located next to a new industrial zone in central Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chinese National Federation of Industries (CNFI) Chairman K.C.
Lin said during a tour of Formosa Plastics Group's sixth naphtha
cracking plant in Yunlin County that the establishment of the special
trading zone will allow the government to reach its goal of
persuading industries to stay in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He said that tariff exemptions or reductions within the special
zone will be an added incentive for industry investment. Furthermore,
he added, if the proposed 1,000 hectare zone can escape minimum wage
requirements set forth by the nation's Labor Standards Law,
industries will not have to move out to find low-cost land and labor
in another country.</P>
      <P>Lin pointed out that Yunlin is the closest county in Taiwan
proper to mainland China in terms of distance and that if the
government opens up direct trade, postal, and transportation links
between Taiwan and mainland China in the future, the special trading
zone will be a prime location for industries.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT VOWS TO MAKE ROC `HUMAN RIGHTS MODEL' FOR NEW CENTURY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Green  Island,  Taiwan,  Dec. 9 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>On the eve of International
Human Rights Day, President Chen Shui-bian reaffirmed Saturday his
commitment to making the Republic of China a new "human rights model"
for the 21st century.</P>
      <P>Chen made the pledge while attending activities to mark the
anniversary of the establishment of Asia's first monument to human
rights, situated on Green Island, off Taiwan's southeastern coast.
The scenic offshore island is the site of the ROC's most tightly
guarded prison, which was used to jail political prisoners during
Taiwan's martial law era.</P>
      <P>Chen laid a wreath and bowed three times before the monument to
pay his respects to Taiwan's prisoners of conscience, human rights
and democracy activists.</P>
      <P>The artist-designed monument was inaugurated Dec. 10, 1999 in
celebration of Human Rights Day. However, the monument and an
adjoining wall on which the names of more than 500 political refugees
are inscribed were damaged by typhoon Bilis that hit the Taiwan area
this summer.</P>
      <P>With the support of the Presidential Office and the private Human
Rights Education Foundation, the monument and the adjoining wall have
now been repaired and refurbished and Chen personally presided over
the structures' re-inauguration.</P>
      <P>Chen said Green Island used to be burdened with the "darkest
chapter" of Taiwan's political history.</P>
      <P>"By erecting the Human Rights Monument, we have managed to
transcend the sad, grim past and courageously face our previous
misfortunes and mistakes," Chen said, taking advantage of the
occasion to apologize once again to former political prisoners and
their families on behalf of the government.</P>
      <P>Chen, who took office in Taiwan's first democratic transfer of
political power between different parties, said his administration
will continue to push for the legislation of a human rights law to
offer better human rights protection for ROC nationals and he
declared his determination to set up a national human rights
commission.</P>
      <P>Chen also said he had approved an amnesty for 21 prisoners,
effective Sunday -- International Human Rights Day -- which he said
shows the new ROC government's respect for human rights.</P>
      <P>After ending his speech, Chen walked around the monument, reading
the inscribed eulogy to the political prisoners and examining the

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN PRODIGIES SET WORLD RECORDS FOR MENTAL CALCULATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  Dec.  9  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Three child prodigies in the southern
Taiwan port city of Kaohsiung set new world records for mental
arithmetic Saturday amid the cheers of a large crowd of spectators.</P>
      <P>Wang Chia-lu, 13, set new records for multiplying two eight-digit
numbers as well as two 13-digit numbers in a mental arithmetic
contest sponsored by the Guinness World Asian Witness Center.</P>
      <P>It took Chia-lu only 26.51 seconds to come up with the 26-digit
answer for multiplying two 13-digit numbers, breaking the 28 seconds
Guinness world record set by Shakuntala Devi of India in 1980.</P>
      <P>Chia-lu, a first-grade student at Lingya Junior High School in
downtown Kaohsiung, has long been famous for his incredible ability
to add, multiply and divide large numbers in his head.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chia-lu's two sisters -- Wang Yi-hui, 12, and Wang
Hui-yin, 8 -- also broke Guinness world records in the same contest
held at Yencheng Elementary School, also in downtown Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>Yi-hui set a new record by coming up with an answer for adding
100 single-digit numbers in 18.98 seconds, breaking the original
Guinness record of 19.23 seconds.</P>
      <P>The youngest Wang child, Hui-yin, also claimed a slot in the
Guinness Book of World Records Saturday by solving square root of a
six-digit number in 10.48 seconds, faster than the previous Guinness
record by more than 50 seconds.</P>
      <P>Steve Day, chairman of the Guinness World Asian Witness Center,
presided over Saturday's contest. Kaohsiung Mayor Frank Hsieh also
put in an appearance to cheer on the Wang children.</P>
      <P>The three prodigies' father, who is also their trainer, said he
decided to nurture Chia-lu's mental calculation skills when the child
was five years old because Chia-lu was so full of energy that he
found it difficult to concentrate. Chia-lu's two sisters followed the
same training programs, as they also demonstrated an interest in
mental calculation in their early childhood.</P>
      <P>So far, Chia-lu has participated in many international mental
arithmetic contests and has been invited to demonstrate his
incredible capability in many countries.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT HEAD CRITICIZES ROC PRESIDENT FOR WANTING TO AMEND CONSTITUTION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  9 (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian
is attempting to amend the Constitution to gain more power, the
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) chairman said Saturday via a written
address read out in his absence at a KMT-organized seminar.</P>
      <P>Lien Chan, who is currently in Europe, criticized Chen and his
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) for "trampling" the ROC
Constitution for his own benefit.</P>
      <P>KMT Deputy Secretary-General Shao Yu-ming read out Lien's address
at a seminar on the developments in constitutional government, which
was sponsored by a KMT think tank.</P>
      <P>However, after the seminar, DPP Policy Executive Director Shen
Fu-hsiung denied Lien's charges and said that Chen has not violated
the Constitution. Shen added that the KMT, as the legislative
majority, should have toppled the Cabinet when Chen failed to allow
the KMT to form the Cabinet -- and thereby a coalition government.</P>
      <P>Therefore, he went on, Chen has the right not to let the
parliamentary majority head the Cabinet, although he admitted that
both sides deserve "50 thrashings."</P>
      <P>Citing France as example, Shen noted that of the six occasions
when France's president and parliamentary majority hailed from
different parties, three times the problem was resolved by
establishing a coalition government, twice the president ended up
dissolving the parliament, and once led to the parliamentary majority
toppling the Cabinet.</P>
      <P>As to whether a new constitutional amendment will bring the
country toward a presidential system of government, a parliamentary
system, or a dual-leadership system, Shen said that it will require
"everyone's opinions."</P>
      <P>Chen had first tried to form a so-called "government of the
people" by putting Tang Fei, a KMT stalwart, at the head of the
largely DPP-led Cabinet in May, and then replacing him with the
current Premier Chang Chun-hsiung in October, officially signaling
the start of his minority government.</P>
      <P>The KMT and the opposition alliance it formed with the People
First Party (PFP) and the New Party (NP) have been advocating that
the government return to the "modified" dual-leadership system they
say is stipulated in the Constitution.</P>
      <P>Chou Yu-jen, a professor of policy administration at National
Taipei University, said that the ROC constitutional system is similar
to that of France, wherein if the elected president belongs to a
different party than the parliamentary majority party, then the
president's powers are limited, and the majority party has the right
to form a Cabinet.</P>
      <P>Chou criticized Chen for attempting to use his "subjective
willpower" to override the system.</P>
      <P>Another scholar at the seminar, Shih Cheng-feng, a professor of
public administration at Tamkang University, put forward a different
view, saying that the last constitutional amendment in 1997 adjusted
the constitutional system to a presidential-based structure wherein
the key is that the president's selection of a premier no longer
requires the approval of the legislature.</P>
      <P>Therefore, said Shih, who stressed that he was not a DPP member,
the Constitution does not lean toward a parliament-based system when
the president and the legislative majority are from different
parties.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Nearly 70 percent of the people of Taiwan
are in favor of cutting the number of legislators by half, according
to the results of a poll released Sunday.</P>
      <P>The poll, conducted by the Coalition to Cut the Number of
Legislators by Half, surveyed 1,068 people from Dec. 5-7 and had a
margin of error of 3 percent.</P>
      <P>Up to 68.48 percent of the respondents said they are in favor of
cutting the 220-seat legislature, compared with 9.78 percent who said
that are against the idea. Some 21.74 percent expressed no opinion.</P>
      <P>The number of Taiwan's legislators ballooned in the wake of the
streamlining of Taiwan provincial government. Legislator Chang
Hsueh-shun recently launched a drive to half the number of
legislative seats, saying that the low performance of the legislators
has long been a point of contention on the part of the public.</P>
      <P>Some 48.91 percent of those polled said they are also in favor of
the proposed single-seat system, meaning one seat for one
constituency, compared with 32.61 percent who are against the
proposal, with 18.48 percent expressing no opinion.</P>
      <P>Fifty percent of the respondents said they are also in favor of
the proposed two-vote system -- one vote for the candidate and one
vote for the party -- compared with 30.43 percent who are against the
idea, with 19.57 percent expressing no opinion.</P>
      <P>Legislator Chuang Sheng-jung, a member of the opposition
coalition, said that the proposal to halve the number of legislators
has won support across the party spectrum and he urged speedy action
to revise the Constitution.</P>
      <P>Chuang expressed the hope that constitutional revision can be

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian oversaw a group
wedding ceremony in Taipei Sunday to mark International Human Rights
Day.</P>
      <P>Describing their marriage as "Marriages for Human Rights" Chen
urged the brides and bridegrooms to make "respect, tolerance, sense
and sensibility" the four pillars of their marriage and to live out
human rights in their new families.</P>
      <P>The president, known for his tenderness and thoughtfulness toward
his paralyzed wife, encouraged the new couples to instill the idea of
human rights in the minds of their future children and to develop
their children into "human rights seeds."</P>
      <P>During the ceremony staged at the Taipei Guest House, Chen read
the wedding pledge for the 36 new couples that they vow to love one
another until the end of their lives and not to be separated by
anything other than death.</P>
      <P>The pledge also said that the couples agree to refer their
disputes, if any, over the question of having children to "experts"
for resolution rather than trying to sort it out themselves.</P>
      <P>The wedding pledge also includes the clause that they will never
force their children to fulfill their own desires or make the
children the parents' showpiece.</P>
      <P>Saying that "a spacious heart is worth more than a spacious
house," Chen urged the new couples to be tolerant toward their
spouses and never forget the admiration they have toward their other
halves which led to their trip up the aisle.</P>
      <P>Among the witnesses of the wedding ceremony was writer Po Yang,
who put forward the idea of the group wedding. As a former political
prisoner, Po now serves as a human rights adviser to the president.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN'S ECONOMY SAID NOT AFFECTED BY  BUSINESS EXODUS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  10  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The former head of the nation's top
economic planner said Sunday that the exodus of domestic industries
to Southeast Asia and mainland China has not affected the nation's
economy.</P>
      <P>P.K. Chiang, former chairman of the Council for Economic Planning
and Development, made the remarks in a seminar titled "Economic
Globalization -- Economic Cooperation Between the Two Sides of the
Taiwan Strait" sponsored by Tamkang University.</P>
      <P>Chiang, who currently serves as president of the main opposition
Kuomintang think tank the National Policy Foundation, noted that
since the appreciation of the new Taiwan dollar in 1986 and 1987,
domestic businesses have begun to invest in Southeast Asia and
mainland China.</P>
      <P>Though a large amount of capital has flowed out, it has not
resulted in the hollowing-out of domestic industry, Chiang said.
Exports this year have boomed, showing that the fundamentals of the
nation's economy are still good and that the industrial sector has
continued to upgrade, he added.</P>
      <P>Chiang said Taiwan must maintain its competitive edge, which he
said is the government's paramount task.</P>
      <P>He suggested that the government think in three directions,
citing first the example of Taiwan's large trade deficit with Japan.</P>
      <P>Chiang said that Taiwan has long wanted to improve the trade
deficit with Japan and has introduced technology, capital and
research and development from Japan, hoping to make up for the large
number of imports from Japan. However, he went on, the trade deficit
has not decreased, showing that Japan has maintained its edge by
pumping large amounts of money and effort into R&amp;D.</P>
      <P>He said that what the government should therefore do is maintain
a technological edge over mainland China.</P>
      <P>He also said that there should be no borders for the movement of
capital and urged the government to improve the domestic investment
environment so that local businesses will keep their faith and roots
in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Third, he continued, the government should try to keep the
profits of those companies investing overseas, including Southeast
Asia and mainland China, in Taiwan, by keeping their orders,
negotiating, R&amp;D, and marketing operations in Taiwan, which he said
will help realize the nation's goals of becoming an Asia and Pacific
operations center and an Asia and Pacific logistic planning center.</P>
      <P>On whether to permit the nation's high-tech industries to invest
in the mainland, Chiang said that those high-tech industries that
have a competitive edge should stay in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He added, however, that the competitive edge will not remain
static and said the government should periodically review the
situation.</P>
      <P>But he also said that the government should still ban Taiwan
investment in large-scale mainland investment projects such as power
plants and public construction.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  10  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A consensus between Taiwan and mainland
China reached in 1992 would serve as the best option to break the
cross-Taiwan Strait stalemate, former Mainland Affairs Council (MAC)
head Su Chi said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Su, who currently serves in the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
think tank the National Policy Foundation, made the remarks in a
seminar titled "Economic Globalization: Economic Cooperation Between
the Two Sides of the Taiwan Strait" sponsored by Tamkang University.</P>
      <P>Su said that the 1992 consensus is the only political compromise
reached between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait and paved the way
for a historic high-level meeting across the Taiwan Strait the
following year.</P>
      <P>Su noted that the cross-strait standoff is rooted in the "one
China" issue, and that the previous KMT government advocated an
agreement that it says was reached in 1992 on "one China, different
interpretations." The mainland, however, has denied since 1995 that
such an agreement was ever reached.</P>
      <P>Beijing espouses "one China," which is anathema to the new
government of the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party. This
is why, Su said, he promoted in May this year a vague term of "1992
consensus," hoping to defuse the cross-strait tension.</P>
      <P>Su noted that as far back as 1991, the KMT held to the concept
that Taiwan is part of China and the mainland is part of China, while
Beijing said only that Taiwan is part of China.</P>
      <P>Su said he regretted that it is only now that Beijing has come
around to the KMT stance, referring to a recent statement by Beijing
Vice Premier Qian Qichen that Taiwan and the mainland are both part
of China.</P>
      <P>Su said that he believes cross-strait relations are complicated
and require careful consideration of political and economic factors.</P>
      <P>In addition, he went on, with the changing times and environment,
the government should also make adjustments to the "go slow, be
patient" policy and the current ban on direct cross-strait trade,
postal and transport links.</P>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan should consider importing natural
gas from Siberia and the Kurile Islands, or should invest in those
regions, the Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD)
said Sunday.</P>
      <P>In an analysis of the international economic situation in its
weekly publication, the CEPD noted that Japan, South and North Korea
and Russia have cooperated to develop oil and natural gas in the
region.</P>
      <P>The article said that taking part in the energy development in
Northeast Asia will not only benefit Taiwan's industrial development,
but will also help ensure a steady supply of energy. In addition, it
will help promote substantive relations between Taiwan and Russia.</P>
      <P>The article noted that the nation's energy supply relies almost
entirely on imports, mainly from the Middle East.</P>
      <P>But with the world trend toward a balanced development of energy,
environmental protection and the economy, nations such as mainland
China, South Korea and Japan have signed cooperation agreements with
Russia to develop energy sources.</P>
      <P>The article suggests that the nation should follow this lead and
consider importing natural gas from Siberia, the Far East or Kurile
Islands, especially now that the government has announced the halting
of construction of the island's fourth nuclear power plant and
increased the ratio of natural gas in the nation's energy sources.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GOVERNMENT BUDGET FACES UPHILL WAR IN LEGISLATURE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  10  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government budget which has already
been cut by NT$21.5 billion (US$651.51 million) in the review of
committees faces a continued uphill fight at the joint session of the
Legislative Yuan that will begin from Dec. 18.</P>
      <P>Legislator Chu Li-lung, a convenor of the opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) budget reviewing panel at the Legislative Yuan has threatened
to cut the budget by another NT$75.5 billion at the joint session.</P>
      <P>Chu played down the size of the cut to date -- NT$663.1 billion
out of government projected revenues of NT$1.45 trillion, and NT$21.5
billion out of projected outlays of NT$1.6 trillion -- which accounts
for a 4.33 percent cut of the government's income and 1.34 percent of
the government's expenditure.</P>
      <P>Both figures are less than the average of the last decade, said
Chu.</P>
      <P>Fellow KMT legislator Ho Chih-hui criticized the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) which, he said, although it vowed
to rein in the government's "swollen budget" before taking power, has
reneged on its promise by expanding the budget by 7.3 percent,
leading to a projected deficit of NT$600 billion (US$18.18 billion).</P>
      <P>The KMT legislator's view struck a chord with the two other main
opposition parties.</P>
      <P>New Party Legislator Lai Shih-pao predicted that the government's
budget will undergo another round of cuts during the joint session
because the committee members -- who are often closely related to the
government agencies monitored by the committee -- are usually
unwilling to slash the budget too much.</P>
      <P>The joint session that brings together all Taiwan's lawmakers is
usually more sensible in its review and is likely to rid the budget
of more redundant expenditure, said Lai.</P>
      <P>He said a cut of 5 percent, or NT$80 billion, is reasonable and
will not seriously threaten the government's agenda.</P>
      <P>The People First Party (PFP) also supports the claims for more
budget cuts.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lee Ching-an, a spokeswoman for the PFP, did not say
how much more her party believes should be slashed from the budget,
but promised the figure would be appropriate.</P>
      <P>The three parties command a comfortable majority in the
legislature, and are capable of scuttling any budget they believe to
be unnecessary.</P>
      <P>Among the items that have already fallen victim to the ax are
NT$1.5 billion for waterworks intended to plug the water supply gap
created by the government's plan to scrap the construction of the
Meinung Reservoir in southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The budget of Academia Sinica, whose president, Lee Yuan-tseh, is
a enthusiastic supporter of President Chen Shui-bian, has been
considerably pared, while the budget for the Executive Yuan's Science
and Technology Commission of which Lee doubles as head has been cut
off entirely.</P>
      <P>Even the budget for the Presidential Office has not been spared
the ax and has been trimmed by NT$180 million, while the budget for
rental of a house for Vice President Annette Lu was cut by half.</P>
      <P>The DPP criticized the opposition for what it said was venting
anger over its defeat in the presidential election by mauling the
government budget with the design of paralyzing the administration.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Hsu Tien-tsai said the oppositions is holding the
nation hostage by tampering with the government budget in an
"insensitive" manner.</P>

(By David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Kaohsiung City Hall
sponsored a concert Sunday to commemorate the 21st anniversary of the
Formosa Incident, which occurred in the southern port city.</P>
      <P>Many people jailed for years after the incident were invited by
Kaohsiung Mayor Frank Hsieh to attend the event, among them Tsai
Ching-wen, a seller of Formosa magazine at the time of the incident.
He was sentenced to nine years in jail for his part in the incident.</P>
      <P>The incident is generally thought to have been a turning point in
Taiwan's political history and an event that led eventually to the
lifting of martial law, as well as the ending of a ban on new
political parties and newspapers.</P>
      <P>The opposition camp formed the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
in 1986. Fourteen years after its founding, the party finally took
power, ending the Kuomintang's 55 year-rule on the island.</P>
      <P>The Formosa Incident occurred on the night of Dec. 10, 1979, when
a group of opposition activists clashed with police during a
torchlight parade to observe International Human Rights Day. Sixteen

    <HEADLINE>12 ARRESTED IN CONNECTION WITH ARMS SMUGGLING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 10 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Some 12 suspects in an arms smuggling ring
were arrested and a large haul of arms were seized during an
extensive raid, police said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Police said that they were tipped off more than one month ago
that gangster Chu Chung-shun, 39, was planning along with several
accomplices to smuggle arms to Taiwan from Thailand, and began a
large-scale stakeout operation.</P>
      <P>Police said that after Chu boarded a plane from Bangkok to Taiwan
Saturday afternoon, they began simultaneous raids in Taichung,
Taoyuan and Taipei, arresting a total of 11 people. Chu himself was
arrested upon landing at Taiwan's Chiang Kai-shek International
Airport.</P>
      <P>Police seized a bill of lading from Chu, which they traced to a
crate of arms in the cargo section of the airplane. The arms,
including 17 pistols, one shotgun and more than 1,500 rounds of
ammunition, were hidden in generators that had had their insides
removed.</P>
      <P>An initial investigation found that Chu, who had been posing as
an importer of generators for use in quake-affected areas in the wake
of the devastating Sept. 21 earthquake last year, had worked the ruse
on at least five previous occasions.</P>
      <P>Police estimate that he has brought more than 70 guns and
thousands of rounds ammunition into Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>RICE WINE PRICES TO INCREASE ANNUALLY AFTER TAIWAN'S WTO ENTRY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  11  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The price of rice wine will still be
adjusted upward each year after Taiwan's entry into the World Trade
Organization despite an earlier decision by the Legislature, Vice
Economic Affairs Minister Chen Ruey-long said Monday.</P>
      <P>Amid public concerns about rising rice wine prices, the Finance
Committee of the Legislative Yuan decided last week that the Taiwan
Tobacco and Wine Board (TTWB) would not be allowed to raise the price
of rice wine without the consent of the legislature.</P>
      <P>Chen, speaking at a seminar in Kaohsiung on the new business
opportunities to be created by Taiwan's entry into the WTO, said that
after Taiwan joins the world trade body, rice wine will be classified
as a distillate, resulting in a high tax levy of NT$185 (US$5.58) per
liter.</P>
      <P>A standard 0.6-liter bottle of rice wine will therefore be priced
at more than NT$100 (US$3.02), with the price being adjusted upward
each year thereafter, Chen said.</P>
      <P>But Chen also said that Taiwan has stepped up its communications
with other nations during its negotiations to enter the WTO,
explaining to them that rice wine is a staple ingredient in Chinese
cooking and soliciting their understanding for more time in making
the adjustment.</P>
      <P>The TTWB has also launched a cooking wine onto the market in
order to meet the needs of consumers. The cooking wine has a tax levy
of only NT$22 per liter.</P>
      <P>People are reportedly already hoarding Red Label, the most
popular rice wine manufactured by the TTWB, in anticipation of
Taiwan's entry into the WTO, which could take place early next year.</P>
      <P>Shortages of Red Label rice wine as a result of hoarding actually
began as early as November 1999 when talk of Taiwan's WTO accession
was widespread.</P>
      <P>The shortage prompted the TTWB to import rice wine from Singapore
to overcome the shortfall in domestic production capacity.</P>
      <P>Currently, both the domestically produced Red Label rice wine and
the imported variety are priced at NT$24 per bottle.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOEA TO UNVEIL RELAXED MAINLAND INVESTMENT POLICY IN 20 DAYS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  11  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA)
will unveil an eased "no haste, be patient" mainland investment
policy before the end of this year, Economics Minister Lin Hsin-yi
said Monday.</P>
      <P>Fielding questions at a Legislative Yuan committee meeting, Lin
said the modified policy on mainland China-bound investment will
give local companies greater freedom to invest on the mainland while
requiring them to adopt capital risk management measures.</P>
      <P>Under pressure from local entrepreneurs, legislators and
economists, the MOEA has been reviewing the "no haste" mainland
investment policy implemented by the previous Kuomintang (KMT)
government.</P>
      <P>Lin told members of the Legislature's economic and budgetary
affairs committees that the policy review in entering the final
stage and that the MOEA will come up with a revised version of the
policy in 20 days.</P>
      <P>In an attempt to cool a continued mainland investment
fever amid Beijing's persistent hostility toward Taiwan, the former
KMT government implemented a "no haste, be patient" policy in 1996.
As the mainland economy continues thriving, local companies have
been pressuring the government to ease the policy to allow them
greater freedom to relocate production lines there to help maintain
their market niches.</P>
      <P>Under the "no haste" policy, Taiwan companies are banned from
investing in mainland China's infrastructure construction and
certain strategic industries. Moreover, the maximum amount for each
investment project should not exceed US$50 million.</P>
      <P>Lin said the adjusted policy will offer Taiwan companies greater
freedom in deciding the fields or industries in which they will
invest on the mainland.</P>
      <P>Attracted by cheap land and labor as well as a common language
and culture, Taiwan enterprises have poured some US$40 billion into
the mainland for various investment projects over the past decade.</P>
      <P>Asked how the MOEA evaluate the possible impact on cross-Taiwan
Strait economic relations of Taiwan's and mainland China's
anticipated accession to the World Trade Organization in the coming
spring, Lin said WTO entry is indeed a "variable" to Taiwan's
domestic economic situation and its trade with the mainland.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Lin said he is convinced that the MOEA will be
able to cope with any new challenges, including improving the
domestic investment climate.</P>
      <P>Lin further said he hopes the domestic political situation will
remain stable next year and that the local economy will bottom out of
its current slowdown.</P>

      <P>In its Nov. 16 issue, the Journalist alleged that Lu was the
source of the rumor about an extramarital affair between President
Chen Shui-bian and one of his female aides.</P>
      <P>Lu's legal team, calling the Journalist's report "obviously false
and malicious," demanded that the magazine publish a half-spread
front-page apology approved by Lu's lawyers in six newspapers and
also make public the full text of the apology via six electronic
media outlets before Dec. 10.</P>
      <P>The legal team also demanded that the magazine conduct a full
investigation into related "acts of negligence" by its reporters,
writers, and editors and "dish out severe punishment" to show the
news organization's "sincerity in carrying out self-regulation and
self-reflection," or else face legal action.</P>
      <P>But the Journalist did not apologize by the deadline set by the
legal team and only sent a letter to the vice presidential office
last Friday to explain its reports, Tsai said.</P>
      <P>As two members of Lu's six-member legal team are currently out of
the country and as the vice presidential office does not want to
create the impression that it is "wicked and cruel," the office has
decided not to immediately press charges against the Journalist and
to leave the decision up to the legal team, Tsai said.</P>
      <P>Tsai said that the maximum period for filing defamation charges
is six months, adding that there is no hurry to come to any decisions
in the next couple of days.</P>
      <P>The legal team recently discussed follow-up actions and concluded
that should it decide to press charges against the magazine for
painting Lu as a rumormonger, it will demand that the Journalist take
legal responsibility for its reports and will ask for NT$100 million
(US$3.02 million) in compensation.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT TO DIRECTLY ELECT NEW CHAIR NEXT SPRING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  11 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) will
hold the first-ever direct election of its chairman between March and
April next year, a senior party official said Monday.</P>
      <P>Chao Shou-po, director of the KMT Organization and Development
Department, said the party is also planning to hold intraparty
primary elections next May to select its candidates for the elections
of local government chiefs and legislators slated for late 2001.</P>
      <P>Chao said the KMT's membership re-registration will be closed at
the end of this month. "But the party will offer a one-month grace
period for those who for various reasons fail to complete
re-registration before the deadline," he added.</P>
      <P>According to Chao, more than 600,000 previously-registered KMT
members had re-registered as of Dec. 9. In addition, Chao said, the
party has so far managed to attract more than 70,000 newcomers to
join its roster. "Altogether, our membership is approaching the
700,000-mark," he added.</P>
      <P>After wrapping up the membership re-registration, Chao said the
party's next key tasks are electing a new party chairman and holding
primaries for the coming mayoral and parliamentary elections.</P>
      <P>Chao said the 106-year-old KMT, which ruled Taiwan without
interruption for 55 years until May 20, will allow its members to
directly elect their new chairman for the first time next year,
either in March or April. Chao said the KMT is still mulling whether
to hold elections of party congress delegates at the same time as the
chairmanship election.</P>
      <P>In preparation for the elections of local government chiefs and
legislators late next year, Chao said the KMT will hold primaries for
the two critical elections separately in May 2001.</P>
      <P>As the two elections are seen crucial to gauge whether the KMT,
which now still controls a comfortable majority in the legislature,
can stage a comeback in the 2004 presidential election, the party
reportedly will make all-out efforts to win as many seats as
possible.</P>
      <P>Chao said the party will begin accepting registrations for
primary elections for local government chiefs and parliamentary
contests after the Chinese New Year, which falls on Jan. 24.</P>
      <P>To ensure fair competition and prevent hopefuls from changing
their minds, Chao said the KMT will require prospective candidates to
register for party primaries in just one election -- either for the
applicable mayoral and county magistrate race or for the legislative
contest.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AIR FORCE PILOT SHORTAGE IS TEMPORARY: AIR FORCE BRASS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  11  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The current shortage of pilots in the
Republic of China Air Force is just a transitional and temporary
phenomenon, a senior Air Force General Headquarters (AFGH) officer
said Monday.</P>
      <P>AFGH Chief of Staff Chou Wen-chung made the remarks in response
to an inquiry by opposition People First Party (PFP) Legislator Chung
Shao-ho at a Legislative Yuan budget screening meeting on whether the
current pilot shortage threatens Taiwan's security.</P>
      <P>Chou pointed out that the manpower shortage has mainly been
caused by the fact that a number of new pilots of the ranks of first
and second lieutenant are now being trained to operate F5 jet
fighters and AT-3 trainers in order to accumulate the minimum number
of flight hours required for flying a new generation of warplanes.</P>
      <P>According to present air force regulations, a military pilot must
have a minimum of 400 hours of flight time to qualify for operating a
new-generation jet fighter.</P>
      <P>"As new graduates of the Chinese Air Force Academy only have 200
flight hours on their records, they must accumulate additional flight
hours and experience by flying F5 fighters and AT-3 trainers," Chou
explained, adding that the air force cannot compromise on this
requirement, with a view to maintaining the quality of its pilots.</P>
      <P>Chou noted that Taiwan lags behind mainland China in terms of the
number of its military aircraft. "Against this background, we must
endeavor to achieve qualitative superiority in order to maintain air
supremacy in the Taiwan Strait," he said, adding: "This goal can be
attained only by providing ROC pilots with a good training
environment and well-designed courses to perfect their flight skills
and combat tactics."</P>
      <P>Chou said that with an eye on ensuring qualitative superiority,
many air force pilots with more than 400 hours of flight time on
their records now are also receiving "replacement" flight training on
the new-generation fighters.</P>
      <P>Therefore, Chou said, the present pilot shortage is just a
temporary phenomenon during this transitional period.</P>
      <P>As part of its military modernization plan, the ROC air force has
purchased 130 locally developed Ching-kuo indigenous defense (IDFs),
60 French-made Mirage 2000-5 fighters and 150 U.S.-made F-16
fighters. With a number of these advanced warplanes commissioned into
service in the past few years, an unpublished Control Yuan report
said that the nation's air force is suffering a serious pilot
shortfall.</P>
      <P>According to the report by the Control Yuan, the country's
highest watchdog body, the number of first- and second-lieutenant
pilots stationed at the air force's five major bases who are
qualified to operate its second-generation warplanes reaches just 55
percent of current needs.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, press reports said two "seed" flight instructors who
had been trained to operate F-16 and Mirage planes in the United
States and France, respectively, have recently applied for retirement
from the military service. Air force sources said their retirement
will be a great loss to the country at this time of transition in its
military arsenal.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN'S 'SILICON VALLEY' CELEBRATES 20TH ANNIVERSARY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Hsinchu,  Taiwan,  Dec. 11 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian pledged
Monday that his administration will join forces with the private
sector to ensure sufficient water and electricity supplies for
companies in Taiwan's premier high-technology industrial park.</P>
      <P>Chen made the vow in a speech delivered at the opening of a
global high-tech industry forum held in celebration of the 20th
anniversary of the Hsinchu Science-based Industrial Park, Taiwan's
version of the U.S. Silicon Valley.</P>
      <P>Chen said the government will also continue improving Taiwan's
investment climate by cultivating qualified manpower, offering
fine-quality infrastructure and world-standard legal system.</P>
      <P>The president also said he is convinced that so long as Taiwan
can successfully foster new competitive edge, the rapidly increasing
outbound investment by Taiwan firms in recent years, mostly to
mainland China, will not mean an "industrial hollowing out" for
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"In such a case, an exodus of companies will instead mark an
extension of Taiwan's industrial strength," Chen said
optimistically.</P>
      <P>Chen also pitched for his ambitious goal of building Taiwan into
a "green silicon island," saying the plan is not aimed at protecting
any specific industry or enterprise, but aimed at cultivating a new
generation of business executives and enterprises that can use
innovative technologies and open new business frontiers to
accelerate upgrading of industry and overall economy.</P>
      <P>In his speech, President Chen also hailed the achievements of
the Hsinchu Science-based Industrial Park, 70 kilometers (42 miles)
south of Taipei.</P>
      <P>"It has become one of the most successful industrial parks in the
world. With the park, the Republic of China has emerged as a key
high-tech product producer," Chen said, adding: "Its rich experience
has emerged as a textbook for many countries, including mainland
China, in formulating their own science and technology development
policies."</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, Premier Chang Chun-hsiung said
the government is determined to forge partnership with private
industries to create a favorable environment for sustainable economic
development. He also expressed his hope that local technology firms
can help those in traditional industries to transform and upgrade
their production and management in order to survive increasingly
intense global competition.</P>
      <P>Sixteen information-technology industry heavyweights from eight
countries and 20-plus local high-tech industry executives are
attending the two-day forum to draw up a new blueprint for Taiwan's
high-tech industry development.</P>
      <P>Occupying a land of 600 hectares, the industrial park houses 390
companies, notably microchip makers, integrated circuit design
houses, computer and computer peripheral companies.</P>
      <P>With a combined total of 100,000 employees, the industrial park's
output is forecast to surge to NT$900 billion (US$27.26 billion) in
2000, up from NT$300 billion in 1995.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CROSS-STRAIT DISPUTE IS ABOUT POLITICAL SYSTEMS: MAC VICE HEAD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  11  (CNA)
(By Edward Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC) Vice Chairman Chen Ming-tung said here Monday that the current
dispute between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait is an argument
over political systems, and not over national reunification or
independence.</P>
      <P>He said that actually, the dispute over national reunification or
independence falls under the main issue of political systems, since
the choice of Taiwan's national identification will eventually be
decided through its political system, he said.</P>
      <P>He said that he did not regard a supporter of Taiwan independence
as someone who has "forgotten his own origins" -- despite criticism
to that effect from the authorities in Beijing.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks in a keynote speech on cross-strait
relations at a seminar for the Chinese-language Teachers of Malaysia
sponsored by the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, which is under
the control of the Executive Yuan.</P>
      <P>Chen pointed out that the "three direct links" between the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait would benefit both sides, as long as they
cooperate with each other. If both sides operate on the basis of
economic cooperation and shared interests, the links would help to
improve peaceful political relations across the Taiwan Strait, he
said.</P>
      <P>"If both sides could cooperate, it would create an everlasting
peace," he said, going on to quote a Chinese proverb that any place
that a merchant cannot reach must be at war. He also called on
leaders in mainland China to strengthen economic cooperation between
the two sides of the Taiwan Strait after both sides are admitted into
the World Trade Organization.</P>
      <P>Asked why President Chen Shui-bian has only identified himself as
Taiwanese and has not said that he is also Chinese, Chen Ming-tung
noted that the president has never said that he is not Chinese.</P>
      <P>Chen also expressed the hope that mainland China will enter into
negotiations with Taiwan over the "mini three links" scheduled to be
opened next January.</P>

      <P>Apparently affected by domestic political
unrest, the number of major investments of more than NT$200
million decreased by nearly 50 percent annually in November, the
Ministry of Economics Affairs reported Monday.</P>
      <P>The decline was more than 50 percent in terms of capital volume,
the MOEA added.</P>
      <P>Just four new major investment projects, worth a total of NT$3
billion, were registered in November, the MOEA said. It added that
there were seven new major investment projects worth a cumulative
NT$8.8 billion were registered last November. MOEA officials
attributed the decrease to domestic political unrest and the
worsening investment climate in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>A total of 185 new major investment projects were registered
during the January-November period this year, worth a total of
NT$615.2 billion.</P>
      <P>About 50 percent of that total was invested in electronic
machinery and electronics. Among the standouts, Taiwan Semiconductor

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  12  (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan enterprises will have more trade
opportunities in mainland China after both sides of the Taiwan Strait
enter the World Trade Organization (WTO), said a high-ranking
Republic of China policy planner Monday.</P>
      <P>Chen Ming-tung, vice chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC), said in a symposium on trade between the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait that ROC's Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) is also
evaluating whether to revise the country's "no haste, be patient"
policy toward Taiwan investment in mainland China.</P>
      <P>Chen added that the ministry will come up with an initial
conclusion before the end of the year.</P>
      <P>Under the "no haste" policy, Taiwan companies are banned from
investing in infrastructure construction projects in mainland China,
as well as certain strategic industries. Moreover, the maximum amount
for each investment project is not supposed to exceed US$50 million.</P>
      <P>Chen declined to comment on the call to ease the "no haste"
policy from many ROC industrial leaders, including Formosa Plastics
Group President Wang Yung-ching. Chen only said that the MOEA has
been evaluating the request.</P>
      <P>Noting that many Taiwanese traditional industries have already
invested in mainland China, Chen said that Taiwan firms will have
more space to develop their share of the mainland market after the
entry of both sides of the Taiwan Strait into the WTO. He warned that
WTO entry will also result in fierce competition.</P>
      <P>He urged industries in Taiwan and mainland China to cooperate and

    <HEADLINE>HSINCHU INDUSTRIAL PARK FOUNDER PLEASED WITH ITS 20-YEAR HISTORY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Hsinchu,  Taiwan, Dec. 11 (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Irving T. Ho, one of the founders
of Hsinchu Science-Based Industrial Park, said Monday that
establishing the park proved to be the correct policy, considering
the facility's contribution to Taiwan's economy in the past 20 years.</P>
      <P>Ho, who also served as the first director general of what has
often been hailed as the world's No. 1 high-tech complex, said at the
park's 20th anniversary celebration that a total of US$600 million
has been invested throughout the years to develop the facility, but
that the total cumulative returns have exceeded US$100 billion. This
160-fold investment return is "very worthwhile," he added.</P>
      <P>Aggregate sales of the more than 200 technology-based firms in
the park will reach NT$900 billion (US$27.2 billion) this year, which
is equivalent to approximately 10 percent of Taiwan's Gross National
Product, Ho noted. He went on to say that the Hsinchu site takes up
only six square kilometers, making the park's accomplishments all the
more remarkable.</P>
      <P>Ho urged Taiwan's high-tech industries to set their sights on
network, communication, software, and biotechnology development while
continuing to innovate. He added that Taiwan and mainland China
should cooperate with each other instead of looking at their
respective high-tech development efforts as a zero-sum game.</P>
      <P>Regarding fears that Taiwan may lose its competitiveness if
industries continue to set up their manufacturing centers in mainland
China, Ho said that as long as better products can be developed to
replace the ones that left, Taiwan should be able to retain its edge.</P>
      <P>Ho worked for IBM in the United States for 16 years prior to
returning to Taiwan at the invitation of then-Premier Sun Yun-suan,
who was also present at Monday's celebrations in his current capacity
as a senior presidential adviser.</P>
      <P>Upon returning to Taiwan, Ho took up the post of vice chairman of
Taiwan's National Science Council (NSC) and concurrently served as
the head of a division of the NSC called the Science-based Industrial
Park Administration, which oversees the Hsinchu site.</P>
      <P>He later served as the president of Taiwan's Institute for
Information Industry, a quasi-governmental organization that promotes
Taiwan's information industry and is charged with accelerating the
country's national computerization program.</P>
      <P>Ho is currently an adviser to several industrial parks in
mainland China and the chairman of EiC Corp., a U.S.-based integrated
circuit company specializing in the development of wireless handset
components.</P>
      <P>As a successful example of a government-university-industry
initiative, the park is home to such prominent names as Acer and
Mitec, leading manufacturers of personal computers; Taiwan
Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp., a pioneer in the semiconductor
foundry business; United Micro-Electronics Corp. and TI-Acer, both
leaders in the microprocessor and DRAM/SRAM business; and Umax, a

      <P>The Tainan Science-Based
Industrial Park in southern Taiwan escaped damage from three
earthquakes which hit southern Taiwan Monday, thanks to their
efficient safety measures.</P>
      <P>The three quakes, with magnitudes of 5.3, 4.6 and 4.8
respectively, occurred between 3:30 a.m. and 5:34 a.m.</P>
      <P>The preparatory center of the industrial park said that the
strong earthquake that caused tremendous loss to manufactorers in the
Hsinchu Science-based Industrial Park on Sept. 21 last year have
prompted most high-tech companies to strengthen measures to counter
quake damage. Hsinchu Science-based Industrial Park is often called
the Silicon Valley of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>For example, the center added, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing
Co. Ltd. and Chi Mei Corp. purchased their own seismometers in order
to receive related information and take emergency measures as quickly
as possible.</P>
      <P>The Tainan Science-Based Industrial Park, which is expected to be
completed in 2005, will be able to accommodate some 200 companies and
employ more than 70,000 workers.</P>

high-tech industries is the crucial factor in the park's success.</P>
      <P>The premier went on to say that the 21st century will see fierce
competition in various industries. The United States is expected to
lead other countries in the areas of biotechnology and information

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 11 (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian
told visiting Tennessee Governor Don Sundquist Monday that
safeguarding the peace and stability of the Asia Pacific region
conforms with both ROC and U.S. interests.</P>
      <P>Chen went on to say that American democracy serves as a model for
the Republic of China. Taking this year's shambolic U.S. presidential
election as an example, Chen said that although the results are not
yet known, the American people have "retained their rationality" out
of respect for the system and the constitution and are "quietly
waiting" for the outcome. "That is democracy," he added.</P>
      <P>Chen went on to say that although he himself won the ROC
presidential election in March by only a slim 2.5 percent margin, or
310,000 votes, the people fully accepted the election results with no
legal contentions and no "unfortunate casualties" afterward. This, he
continued, is what is so noteworthy about Taiwan's democratic
maturity.</P>
      <P>In reply, Sundquist quoted former British Prime Minister Winston
Churchill, who once quipped that "democracy is the worst form of
government, except for all the others that have been tried from time
to time." Sundquist went on to say that the current situation in the
United States where the election results are still up in the air is
indeed a first in U.S. history and a difficult challenge to the
country.</P>
      <P>He added that the situation should end soon so as to allow the
country's affairs to go on.</P>
      <P>Sundquist said that he has been a long-time friend of Taiwan and
that his supportive stance will not change. He praised the Republic
of China's economic accomplishments under its democratic system and
expressed his hope that the two countries will continue to strengthen
cooperative and exchange efforts under a liberalized trading
environment.</P>
      <P>Sundquist's delegation of four arrived in Taipei last Thursday
and is scheduled to depart Tuesday. This is his fifth visit to

    <HEADLINE>SCHOLAR PREDICTS STABLE TAIPEI-BEIJING RELATIONS FOR THREE YEARS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New  York,  Dec.  10  (CNA)
(By Eric C.Y. Tseng and Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei-Beijing relations will remain
stable for the next three years because mainland China is "secretly
happy" about the current cross-Taiwan Strait situation, Chou
Yang-sun, a former Republic of China legislator, said here Sunday.</P>
      <P>Chou, who is currently a visiting professor at Columbia
University, said at a seminar organized by opposition New Party
supporters in New York that Beijing is also pleased that the new U.S.
president -- whoever it may be -- will probably not change the
existing U.S. policy toward mainland China because he will be a
"minority president."</P>
      <P>According to Chou, the U.S. electoral college system was designed
to protect the rights of smaller states, and that if Texas Governor
George W. Bush were to eventually win the election, then it would
signify the failure of popular democracy and the victory of the
constitutional system.</P>
      <P>Regardless, Chou continued, making changes to an existing
constitutional system is not something that should be spoken of
lightly. He cited Taiwan's six constitutional amendment efforts as
examples of this, saying that the fifth attempt actually violated the
Constitution itself.</P>
      <P>As to whoever becomes the next U.S. president, Chou said that the
split in various levels of government caused by the ongoing political
and legal contentions will leave the new leader as a "minority"
leader who is likely to tread a careful line.</P>
      <P>From the mainland Chinese perspective, Chou said that Beijing has
been maintaining a watchful attitude toward Taiwan's political
development since the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party
took the reins of power in March.</P>
      <P>Chou said that ROC President Chen Shui-bian's repeated pledges
not to declare independence during his four-year term, the numerous
other olive branches he has held out toward Beijing, and the domestic
political instability in Taiwan, have all pleased Beijing. On the
surface, however, mainland China continues to "sound tough" toward
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chou claimed that because Beijing was able to achieve its
objectives without using a single soldier or bullet, he believes that
no matter how tough Beijing may seem over the next three years,
cross-strait relations should remain stable.</P>
      <P>However, ha also said that in the second half of 2003, Chen will
be facing another election battle and may give way to some extent in
bilateral relations, thereby bringing about possible changes in
cross-strait development.</P>

(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan authorities will lift the last
restriction on foreign investors' stakes in any individual listed
firm at the beginning of next year, Vice Finance Minister Chen Chung
said Monday.</P>
      <P>Chen told the Legislative Yuan that Taiwan will open its market
fully to foreign investors from Jan. 1, 2001, as promised in its
protocol for entry into the World Trade Organization.</P>
      <P>Current regulations limit foreign ownership in any listed firm to
75 percent of its shares.</P>
      <P>Since Jan. 1 is a bank holiday, the new regulation will take
effect Jan.2, Chen added.</P>
      <P>Chen made the comment in response to legislators' concerns that
the Morgan Stanley Capital International Inc. (MSCI) has reneged on
its promise to hike Taiwan stock's weighting in its various indices
from 80 percent to 100 percent in May because of the island's
restriction on foreign investment.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, an official at the Securities and Futures Commission
under the Ministry of Finance played down the MSCI's decision as
having more of a psychological than a physical effect.</P>
      <P>So far, the maximum foreign stake in any firm is no more than 30
percent, despite the fact that they can hold up to 75 percent, said
the official, who refused to be named.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei and Beijing will probably enter the
World Trade Organization (WTO) between April and June next year, Vice
Minister of Economic Affairs Lin Yi-fu said Monday.</P>
      <P>Lin said that according to WTO administrative procedures, if
Beijing completes its WTO working group meetings in January next
year, the General Council -- the WTO's highest decision-making body
-- is expected to hold a meeting to finalize the case in March or
April.</P>
      <P>At present, Taipei has completed all bilateral and multilateral
negotiation procedures with all WTO member economies. It is Beijing's
insistence that it join WTO prior to Taipei that has delayed Taipei's
progress in entering the world trade regulatory body as Beijing has
lagged behind in its own entry process.</P>
      <P>Beijing had its last WTO working group meeting in early December
and the final such meeting is scheduled to be held in January. If
everything goes smoothly, it is expected that the meeting of the WTO
General Council will be held in March or April to pass Beijing's WTO
application and Taipei is expected to be admitted into the WTO
shortly afterward.</P>
      <P>Once Taipei's and Beijing's respective legislatures have approved
their own WTO entries, both sides will formally become WTO members.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LAWMAKERS STRIKE OFF BUDGET FOR LAFAYETTES' LOGISTIC SUPPLIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  11  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A NT$330 million (US$10 million) budget
allocation for logistic supplies for the country's six
Lafayette-class missile frigates was axed Monday by the
opposition-held National Defense Committee at the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>The budget for spare parts for the island's six French-made
Lafayettes, which are already in service, was cut entirely by
opposition lawmakers on the grounds that the authorities have failed
to come clean on allegations that huge kickbacks were involved in the
purchase of the six warships.</P>
      <P>New Party Legislator Cheng Long-shui said the government should
not give more money to French company Thomson, which is reputed to
have paid huge kickbacks to officials in Paris, Taipei and even
Beijing in return for a green light for the sale of the warships in
1990s.</P>
      <P>The navy is contemplating a lawsuit against Thomson before a
French court for inflating the price of the Lafayettes with brokers'
commissions, which was forbidden under the contract.</P>
      <P>In an attempt to keep the budget intact, Navy Chief of Staff Vice
Admiral Chang Wen-ping told the legislators that the deal for the
spare parts was signed with the French government rather than
Thomson, and that any breach of the contract could invite claims for
compensation from Paris.</P>
      <P>The only opposition legislator who spoke out for the budget was
Chou Cheng-chih of the Kuomintang, who claimed the deal should not be
canceled to the prejudice of Taiwan's contacts with France, as this
could strengthen Washington's hand in terms of arms sales to the
island.</P>
      <P>However, his arguments failed to cut any ice with his legislative
colleagues.</P>
      <P>Also excised by the committee was a budget of NT$600 million
(US$18.18 million) earmarked for spare parts for the navy's 26 S-2T
anti-submarine aircraft and an unspecified number of helicopters.</P>
      <P>Answering questions from the legislators, Vice Adm. Chang
admitted that only one of the 26 S-2Ts is in fact operational, as all
have engine problems.</P>
      <P>However, the committee did approve a budget for a NT$50,000
(US$1,515) hike in salary for each air force pilot in an attempt to
stop the exodus of jet fighter pilots from military to the civil
aviation industry.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP LAWMAKERS NOT IN FAVOR OF PAY RAISE FOR CIVIL SERVANTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 12 (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung said Tuesday that
the Cabinet's support for a pay raise for the nation's public
servants remains unchanged despite the Democratic Progressive Party's
(DPP's) legislative caucus proposal to delay the move for one year.</P>
      <P>Chang, who heads the DPP administration, said that the 3 percent
salary boost for the Republic of China's government employees,
military personnel, and teachers was included in the budget proposal
for the fiscal year 2001 precisely because it is the Cabinet's "set
policy."</P>
      <P>He added that because the Cabinet's proposed budget must be
reviewed and approved by the Legislative Yuan, where the DPP is a
minority party, the Cabinet will strive to win over legislative
support on this and other items.</P>
      <P>Chu Wu-hsien, director general of the Cabinet's Central Personnel
Administration, pointed out that one-and-a-half years have passed
since the last salary adjustment for public functionaries. He noted
that the consumer price index increased 0.18 percent in 1999 and 1.8
percent for 2000, adding that it is projected to rise 2.01 percent
for 2001, thereby outstripping the proposed 3 percent pay raise.</P>
      <P>He therefore noted that the proposed salary hike is really only
meant to help civil servants cope with the rise in prices and does
not actually represent an increase in their income in real terms.</P>
      <P>DPP legislators Chou Po-lun and Tsai Huang-liang spoke out
against the supposedly "unanimous" passage of the motion to strike
out the NT$21 billion (US$636 million) budget item at the DPP
legislative caucus meeting earlier in the day. The caucus is
scheduled to make its actual proposal to strike out the budget at a
Legislative Yuan meeting next Monday.</P>
      <P>Tsai said he will introduce another proposal to reverse the
caucus decision, and Chou remarked that the factionalism within the
party means "opposition parties aren't even necessary."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the opposition alliance of the Kuomintang, the People
First Party (PFP), and the New Party (NP) announced its support for
the pay raise and criticized the policy about-face.</P>
      <P>PFP spokeswoman Lee Ching-an said the new DPP legislative caucus
decision "came as a surprise" as the Legislature's Organic Committee
had only made a decision days earlier to accept the budget item.</P>
      <P>NP spokesman Lai Shyh-bao said that a pay raise would help boost
morale and would be helpful to the nation's development. He added
that the DPP is the ruling party and yet its own legislative caucus
ended up unilaterally going against the ROC president and Cabinet's
promise for such a salary raise.</P>
      <P>DPP legislative whip Hsu Tien-tsai said that although his caucus
finds it "heartrending" to slash the budget item, public servants,
unlike many laborers, are not in danger of losing their jobs even at
a time when the domestic economy is doing poorly. He therefore
claimed that the public servants should be able to understand the
caucus's "responsible move."</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT CHEN PITCHES FOR SMOOTH WTO ENTRY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  12  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Tuesday he
hopes the two sides of the Taiwan Strait can be admitted to the
World Trade Organization (WTO) simultaneously in the first half of
next year.</P>
      <P>Chen made the appeal while meeting with visiting U.S. Senator
Max Baucus for wide-ranging talks.</P>
      <P>President Chen told the Democratic senator from Montana that he
looks forward to seeing Taipei's and Beijing's smooth WTO entry
next spring without any political interference.</P>
      <P>Chen also expressed his hope that the United States continues to
play an even more active role in the development of cross-Taiwan
Strait relations.</P>
      <P>Baucus joined 14 other U.S. senators in 1992 to push then-U.S.
President George Bush to support the Republic of China's bid to join
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), which was
superseded by the WTO in 1995. "We are grateful for your support for
our national cause," Chen told Baucus.</P>
      <P>Baucus has been concerned about Taiwan's security and supports
continued U.S. supply of defensive weapons to Taiwan in accordance
with the Taiwan Relations Act.</P>
      <P>President Chen requested Baucus to continue joining forces with
his congressional colleagues to back security, peace and stability in
the Taiwan Strait and the entire Asia-Pacific region.</P>
      <P>Touching on cross-strait relations, Chen told Baucus said he
will abide by the ROC constitution to maintain national sovereignty
and dignity while engaging mainland China.</P>
      <P>Chen also pledged his determination to improve cross-strait
relations with wisdom and vision. "My administration is now working
hard to forge a national consensus on how to respond to Beijing's
'one China' principle and to forge a new framework for bilateral
engagement," he explained.</P>
      <P>Chen told Baucus that a cross-party presidential advisory group
has recently come up with "three understandings and four
recommendations" on the future development of cross-strait ties,
including that any changes to Taiwan's present "status quo" must
have the assent of the people of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>As the ROC's national leader, Chen said he fully understands
that he is obligated to maintain peace and security in the Taiwan
Strait for the well-being of Chinese people on both sides of the
Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>For his part, Baucus said he is impressed by Taiwan's remarkable
progress in democratic reform since his first visit to the island in
1992. He particularly lauded Taiwan for its peaceful democratic
transfer of power between different political parties in May.</P>
      <P>Baucus also told President Chen that he is convinced whoever
wins the cliffhanger U.S. 2000 presidential election, the incoming
U.S. administration will continue supporting the ROC and the
current cross-strait status quo. He also suggested that Taiwan
strengthen trade and economic exchanges with the mainland to
facilitate resumption of cross-strait dialogue.</P>
      <P>Baucus concluded his three-day visit to Taiwan Tuesday at the
head of a 22-member Montana trade delegation.</P>

    <DATELINE>Hsinchu,  Taiwan,  Dec.  12  (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Robert H.C. Tsao, chairman of
microprocessor and DRAM/SRAM business leader United Microelectronics
Corp. (UMC), announced Tuesday that his company will invest over
US$2 billion to build a 12-inch wafer plant in Singapore.</P>
      <P>However, he would not divulge who will be the company's partner
in the joint venture, saying only that UMC will retain full control
over the investment.</P>
      <P>Tsao said that the reason his company chose to build the plant in
Singapore is that the Singaporean government understands the
semiconductor industry more than Taiwan's government does and
provides many investment incentives.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the Singaporean government allows companies that
invest there to hire talented people from around the world, creates
an open and global environment, and helps workers at these companies
obtain permanent residence, he added.</P>
      <P>Tsao said that the Singaporean government, unlike Taiwan's,
understands that the semiconductor industry uses less water and
electricity than other industries with similar turnover. The
Singaporean government also knows that the semiconductor industry has
no pollution problems, while the government in Taiwan treats the
industry as a high-polluting industry, he said.</P>
      <P>As for the decision to build a 12-inch wafer plant instead of an
8-inch plant, Tsao said that UMC believes a 12-inch plant would be
more competitive.</P>

    <HEADLINE>'3 MINI LINKS' AIMED AT LEGALIZING CURRENT SMALL-SCALE TRADE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 12 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The primary reason to open the "three mini
links" is to legalize the existing small-scale trade between two
offshore islands and mainland China, the nation's top planner on
mainland policy said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Tsai Ing-wen, chairwoman of the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC),
made the remarks when she called on the opposition New Party caucus
in the Legislative Yuan to exchange views on cross-strait policy.</P>
      <P>On the partial trade, postal and transport links between Kinmen
and Matsu and designated ports in mainland China, commonly known as
the "three mini links," Tsai said the MAC will follow the Legislative
Yuan resolution to consider legalizing the already rampant practice
of small-scale trade between the people of Kinmen and Matsu and
mainland China.</P>
      <P>Tsai said that the MAC would take into account the convenience of
the residents of Kinmen and Matsu, who live closer to mainland China
than to Taiwan proper and who have traded goods with mainland
residents for years. She noted that they could be penalized because
current law still bans such trade, but it would be better to simply
legalize the commerce.</P>
      <P>Tsai said that residents in Kinmen and Matsu who travel to the
mainland and bring back goods should not be considered as smugglers,
which is a factor in considering the legalization of the practice.</P>
      <P>The first stage of the "three mini links" will be to legalize the
current small-scale trade, after which larger-scale commercial trade
can be considered, Tsai said.</P>
      <P>Lai Hsyh-bao, NP legislative whip, said that the three mini links
will be put into practice as scheduled on Jan. 1, 2001, but there is
no timetable for the implementation of the full direct links between
Taiwan proper and the mainland.</P>
      <P>Lai also said that Tsai will consider the introduction of
mainland China laborers to Taiwan and also allow more distant
mainland relatives of Taiwan residents to travel to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Tsai said that it is expected that the first batch of mainland
tourists will come to Taiwan in June next year.</P>
      <P>She also said the crucial part of the current "go slow, be
patient" policy will be adjusted to keep industrial roots in Taiwan.
She also said that a system must be put into place by which capital
would also flow back to Taiwan, rather than simply remaining in the
mainland.</P>
      <P>She stressed that this would entail creating a good economic
environment so that capital would return to the island naturally,
rather than in a compulsory fashion.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN HIGH-SPEED RAIL CORP. SIGNS DEAL WITH JAPANESE FIRM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 12 (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan High-Speed Rail Corp. (THSRC) signed
a formal agreement with Japan's Taiwan Shinkansen Consortium (TSC) in
Tokyo on Tuesday to purchase the core equipment and power system for
the island's first high-speed railway.</P>
      <P>According to a THSRC news release, the NT$95 billion (US$2.9
billion) deal was sealed by THSRC Chairwoman Nita Ing and TSC
Chairman Kazuo Sato.</P>
      <P>The contract came six months after a memorandum of understanding
on the deal was signed, instead of the "four to six weeks" that Ing
had promised at the time. THSRC said that the delay was caused by the
company's desire to ensure that all documents were complete and
carefully handled.</P>
      <P>According to the news release, the Japanese consortium will
obtain a 10 percent stake in THSRC for about NT$13.5 billion (US$409
million) in cash, with TSC's first installment of about NT$2.4
billion (US$73 million) expected by the end of this year.</P>
      <P>TSC will supply "bullet train" locomotives and carriages as well
as signaling, communication, and electrification systems for the
high-speed rail line.</P>
      <P>Construction on the railway started last year, and all systems
are scheduled to be completed before August 2005, with commercial
operation set to begin in October of that year.</P>
      <P>The new system is designed to shorten the travel time between
Taiwan's major northern and southern cities, Taipei and Kaohsiung.
With a maximum speed of 300 kilometers per hour, a trip from Taipei
to Kaohsiung with only a single stop at Taichung will take
approximately 90 minutes, according to THSRC.</P>
      <P>The company noted that a specially designed system will detect
earthquakes and landslides so that trains will automatically slow
down or stop completely.</P>
      <P>The electrification system to be used will be an upgraded version
of the system being used to power Japan's Shinkansen bullet trains.</P>
      <P>TSC's partners include Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Marubeni
Corp., Mitsui Corp., Sumitomo Corp., Kawasaki Heavy Industries, and
Toshiba Electric.</P>
      <P>TSC unexpectedly defeated the Alstom-Siemens Eurotrain consortium
last December to win exclusive negotiating rights for the THSRC's
core system and equipment contract.</P>
      <P>The European consortium, which was named THSRC's "preferred
bidder" in 1997 in a preliminary deal for the equipment and systems,
filed an injunction with Taipei District Court in January to bar
THSRC from signing the contract with the Japanese consortium.</P>
      <P>The legal action was dropped after the judge said Eurotrain
failed to provide sufficient evidence for an injunction against
THSRC.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Li Hongzhi, founder of Falun Gong, has
been nominated for 2001 Nobel Peace Prize, the Hong Kong-based
Information Center for Human Rights and Democracy said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The information center said more than 30 lawmakers and
professors from the United States, the United Kingdom, and some
other countries have jointly nominated Li for the prize.</P>
      <P>They based their decision to nominate him on the grounds that his
theory of Falun Gong has helped enhance peace of human beings, that
his followers have enriched the idea of peace by showing strong
confidence in peace during the harsh government crackdown on the
Falun Gong sect, and that Li and his followers have become a strong
buttress for protection of basic human rights on the Chinese
mainland, it added.</P>
      <P>Founded by Li in 1992, Falun Gong promotes a kind of traditional
Chinese "qi gong". It is a combination of meditation, breathing
techniques, and the idea of "truth, compassion, and forbearance."</P>
      <P>Falun Gong soon became an enormous spiritual movement with
millions of followers in mainland China. The Chinese government
outlawed Falun Gong as an "evil cult" in July last year, and has sent
hundreds of its practitioners to prison and labor camps since then.</P>

    <HEADLINE>`NO HASTE' POLICY AIMED AT RETAINING BUSINESS ROOTS IN TAIWAN: MAC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  12  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government's "no haste, be patient"
policy on mainland China-bound investment is mainly aimed at
encouraging Taiwan enterprises to retain their business roots at
home, a senior mainland policy planner said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen made the
remarks after briefing the legislative caucus of the tiny opposition
New Party.</P>
      <P>"The most important spirit of the `no haste' policy is to make
our entrepreneurs keep their business roots in Taiwan," Tsai
stressed.</P>
      <P>She went on to say that the Republic of China government is
reviewing the policy with the aim of giving local businesses greater
freedom in deciding whether to launch investment projects on the
mainland.</P>
      <P>According to Tsai, the mainland investment policy will be eased
step by step. "Local entrepreneurs need not feel disappointed if the
initial relaxation of restrictions on mainland investment is not very
large," she noted, adding that there will be follow-up adjustment
measures announced later.</P>
      <P>While easing restrictions on the lines of business to be allowed
for Taiwanese investment on the mainland, Tsai said, the government
hopes to simultaneously develop a system that will allow Taiwanese
capital to flow home, to protect Taiwan from a capital drain.</P>
      <P>"To reach this goal, we must create a favorable economic climate
that will make it attractive for Taiwanese investors on the mainland
to willingly remit their capital gains back to Taiwan, " Tsai
explained.</P>
      <P>The "no haste, be patient" policy was first adopted by the
previous Kuomintang government in 1996 to cool a prevailing mainland
investment fever. Economics Minister Lin Hsin-yi said Monday the
Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) will unveil a relaxed version of
the policy in 20 days.</P>
      <P>Tsai said an inter-ministerial task force composed of officials
from the MAC, MOEA and other relevant government agencies, has almost
completed its review of the "no haste" policy.</P>
      <P>"What we are mulling is the speed and scope of the liberalization
of mainland China-bound investment," Tsai said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Vice Economics Minister Chen Ruey-long said six kinds
of technology products, including semiconductors, wireless
communications products and high-end personal computers, will be
opened for Taiwanese investment in mainland China under the adjusted
policy. The six items are currently on an off-limit list.</P>
      <P>Chen said the revised policy will basically offer greater freedom
for local companies to decide the items they plan to produce on the
mainland, while imposing harsher restrictions on capital management.
"We hope local companies can develop capital risk management systems
while launching investment projects across the Taiwan Strait," he
added.</P>
      <P>MOEA sources said that investment in production of 189 high-tech
products, including DRAM (dynamic random access memory chips) and
SRAM (static random access memory chips), will still be banned under
the revised policy.</P>
      <P>In related news, Robert H.C. Tsao, chairman of microprocessor and
DRAM/SRAM business giant United Microelectronics Corp. (UMC),
said he personally opposes restrictions on mainland investment
because Taiwan must promote economic and industrial globalization to
maintain its competitiveness.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Tsao said he also disagrees with the remarks that
if a Taiwan company fails to jump the bandwagon of mainland
investment, it will lose its competitive edge in the global market.
"The remarks are exaggerated," he opined.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Tsao announced Tuesday that his company will invest
over US$2 billion to build a 12-inch wafer plant in Singapore.
However, he would not divulge who will be the company's partner in
the joint venture, saying only that UMC will retain full control over
the investment.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TERRA COTTA WARRIORS AND HORSES ON DISPLAY IN TAIPEI</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 12 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A group 120 terra cotta warriors and horses
from the tomb city of China's first emperor, Qin Shi Huang, who died
more than 2,000 years ago, are arriving in Taipei for a public
exhibition scheduled to kick off Friday.</P>
      <P>Of the 124 terra cotta warriors and horses to be displayed at the
National Museum of History on Nanhai Road, 120 pieces, including 17
that are life-size, have been loaned from six museums in mainland
China's northwestern province of Shaanxi, where the Qin Dynasty
emperors made their capitals and ruled their vassal states.</P>
      <P>The priceless exhibits also include two replicas of bronze
chariots loaned from the National Museum of Natural Science and a
private collector, in addition to two stone tablets, completing the
fullest-ever introduction of Qin culture to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Founded in northern China with both Han people and northern
tribes as its population before the 3rd century BC, the Qin Kingdom
conquered its neighboring kingdoms to become a unified China in 221
BC.</P>
      <P>King Qin Ying Zheng regarded himself as superior to the three
kings and five emperors who were considered the founders of China,
and appointed himself the First Emperor -- "Shi Huang."</P>
      <P>He built the first empire in China at the age of 13 and named it
the Qin Dynasty. In order to strengthen the empire, Qin carried out
centralization and integrated a diverse writing system, the metrology
systems and currencies.</P>
      <P>Believing in the afterlife, Qin ordered the establishment of the
"Underground Palace of Shi Huang," "Pits of Terra Cotta Warriors and
Horses," "Pits of Stables," and "Pits of Bronze Chariots and Horses,"
as well as the surrounding architecture of his tomb.</P>
      <P>According to mainland Chinese archaeologists, Qin ordered the
planning of his tomb in the first year of his coronation. Although
development and building of his tomb was carried out throughout his
tenure of 37 years, the "tomb city" was not completed by the year he
died at the age of 50 in 211 BC.</P>
      <P>Shi Huang's son, who succeeded him, continued the construction of
the "tomb city" and ordered imperial concubines and skilled craftsmen
who made the terra cotta warriors and horses buried alive as
sacrifice to the dead.</P>
      <P>In 1976, northern China was hit by drought and a farmer
accidentally discovered the "Pit of Terra Cotta Warriors and Horses"
while digging a well, opening the passage to the Qin Empire of 2000
years ago.</P>
      <P>The vivid life-sized terra cotta warriors astonished the whole
world, as it had been commonly believed that the Chinese had rarely
produced human sculpture. The discovery of the warriors also helped
piece together the short yet disturbing era of the Qin Dynasty.</P>
      <P>According to archaeologists and historical artifacts experts, the
terra cotta warriors and horses are considered masterpieces for their
sheer size, scale, refined quality, design and beauty.</P>
      <P>The exhibition, the largest of its kind to be mounted outside
mainland China, will last until March 11, according to National
Museum of History officials.</P>

of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), took the helm
Tuesday of an association of lawmakers to promote relations between
the Republic of China and the United States.</P>
      <P>Shih, who renounced his DPP membership last month, succeeded Liu
Sung-pan, a former Legislative Yuan speaker and now a member of the
opposition People First Party (PFP) parliamentary caucus, as
president of the association.</P>
      <P>The changeover ceremony was attended by many prominent political
figures, including Vice President Annette Lu, Premier Chang
Chun-hsiung, Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng, DPP Chairman
Frank Hsieh and PFP Chairman James Soong.</P>
      <P>Visiting U.S. Senator Max Baucus (D-Mont) and several staff
members of the American Institute in Taiwan, which represents U.S.
interests in the ROC in the absence of formal diplomatic ties, also
attended the ceremony.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the occasion, Lu said that despite the absence of
diplomatic ties, substantive ROC-U.S. relations have grown steadily.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan people now make 1 million visits to the United States
annually, while Americans make 300,000 visits to Taiwan. Two-way
trade has also increased substantially," Lu said.</P>
      <P>In the past, she went on, U.S. congressional members have often
played the "role of a lever" to prevent U.S. policy toward the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait from leaning too heavily toward Beijing.</P>
      <P>Lu called on the incoming U.S. administration to further
strengthen exchanges of high-level visits and expand bilateral
cooperation.</P>
      <P>The ROC-U.S. lawmakers association was founded after a trade
dispute between the two countries in 1986, when ROC legislators
organized a delegation to visit the United States and work out a
solution to the squabbles with their American counterparts. The
association was formally inaugurated in Taipei in 1988.</P>
      <P>Shih said the association is an effective conduit for ROC-U.S.
parliamentary exchanges and for the people of the two countries to
share friendship and goodwill.</P>
      <P>Noting that the ROC and the United States have a long tradition
of close cooperation and have made great contributions to world
peace, human rights and democracy, Shih said he will devote his full
energy to the association's operations and boost further cooperation
between the lawmaking bodies of the two countries.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Board of Foreign Trade (BOFT) Tuesday
gave the green light to imports of 27 additional categories of
agricultural and industrial products from mainland China, but denied
the entry of 188 other items, including animal medicine.</P>
      <P>One hundred and forty of the banned 188 items were animal
medicine products, related raw materials and additives for animal
feed, BOFT officials said.</P>

powdered pumpkin -- the only agricultural product approved in the
latest round of government approval on this concern -- and

(By Edward Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Chen Ching-ling, a carrier of hepatitis-B,
has become Taiwan's first patient to receive liver transplant four
years after undergoing an operation to replace her heart with that of
another donor.</P>
      <P>Dr. Cheng Lung-ping of Chang Gung Memorial Hospital said that
Chen had a heart transplant operation four years ago after she gave
birth. A month ago, she contracted acute hepatitis, which
necessitated the liver transplant.</P>
      <P>Dr. Cheng said that Chen had ingested anti-resistance medicine to
retard her immune system after her heart transplant, which was
necessary to enable her body to accept the new heart. Unfortunately,
the same drugs allowed the hepatitis virus already existing in her
body to revive, the doctor added.</P>
      <P>Cheng quoted statistics showing that four to five out of every
500 kidney-transplant patients are later killed by acute hepatitis.</P>
      <P>He said that Chen's case was a rare case in the medical world,
because the patient received both a heart and liver transplant
operation over a period of four years, and with organs from different
donors.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOCK `WORLD COURT' CONVICTS LATE  JAPANESE  EMPEROR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Tokyo,  Dec.  12  (CNA)
(By Mike Chang and Ed Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A mock "world court" known as "The 2000
Tokyo Grand Jury Trial" of Japan's former imperial leadership Tuesday
convicted Japan's late Emperor Hirohito.</P>
      <P>The court also said the government of Japan should bear the
responsibility of apologizing and compensating the women forced into
sexual slavery by the Imperial Army during and before the Second
World War.</P>
      <P>The court was officiated over by four internationally renowned
judges led by Gabrielle Kirk McDonald, former president of the court
that tried former Yugoslavia war criminals.</P>
      <P>The judges read their decision before a group of 80 former
"comfort women" from eight countries in the Asia and Pacific region
and more than 1,000 mass media representatives and civic organization
representatives who supported former comfort women in condemning the
barbaric practices of the former Japanese army.</P>
      <P>The verdicts read in part as follows: "After a three-day trial,
the Japanese late Emperor Hirohito is found guilty for his failure to
stop the former Japanese Imperial Army's sexual slavery system and
violation of humanity."</P>
      <P>The judges went on that the evidence indicates that Hirohito was
not a puppet but the nation's highest administrative decision maker.
Hirohito must have been in a position to know about the Japanese
Imperial Army's cold-blooded behavior during the rape of Nanjing in
1937. Hirohito not only failed to stop the Japanese cruelty but also
agreed to set up "comfort stations" -- euphemisms for army brothels
in which more than 200,000 women were enslaved and raped repeatedly.</P>
      <P>The judges cited testimonies of several former comfort women,
including that of Kao Bao-chu and Lu Man-mei of Taiwan, to prove the
cruel behavior the Japanese.</P>
      <P>The judges also criticized the Japanese government's move to use
a civic foundation to pay reparation, to avoid admitting official
responsibility. The judges also dismissed Japan's assertion that
post-war treaties signed by Japan made it unnecessary to pay
individual compensation.</P>
      <P>The judges called on the Japanese government to assume its
responsibility and apologize to the public.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FOREIGN BANKS TO BE ALLOWED TO MERGE WITH LOCAL COUNTERPARTS</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Foreign banks will be allowed to merge
completely with local banks after the scheduled enactment of the
Banking Law early next year, Finance Minister Yen Ching-chang said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Yen made the remarks while meeting with the heads of the local
branches of foreign banks, including Citibank, N.A., ABN AMRO Bank,
The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, and Banque National de Paris, as well
as chiefs of the American Chamber of Commerce in Taipei and the
European Council of Commerce and Trade (ECCT).</P>
      <P>Yen said that the proposed Banking Law will give foreign-invested
banks national treatment by allowing them to merge 100 percent with
local banks, turning the local banks into branches of the foreign
banks that own them.</P>
      <P>ECCT Chairman Paul Scholten, who is also president of the Taipei
branch of ABN AMRO bank, pointed out that Taiwan will see large-scale
banks which might have a local market share of between 15 percent to
20 percent after mergers are allowed.</P>
      <P>He also said that the impact of Taiwan's entry into the World

Confucius' lesson of the day: "If in governing you depend upon
laws and maintain order by enforcing those laws by punishments, you
can also make the people keep away from wrongdoing, but they will
lose the sense of shame for wrongdoing. If, on the other hand, in
government you depend upon moral sentiment and maintain order by
encouraging education and good manners, the people will have a sense
of shame for wrongdoing and, moreover, will emulate what is good."</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>MND AWARE OF MAINLAND CHINA'S ICBM TESTING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  13  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of National Defense (MND)
said Wednesday it has been fully aware of mainland China's military
activities.</P>
      <P>The ministry was responding to a U.S. Pentagon report that
mainland China tested a new mobile intercontinental ballistic
missile (ICBM) in early November.</P>
      <P>The ministry would not make any comment on the report, but
said instead that mainland China's military activities, including
troop movements and missile testing, have consistently been under the
MND's close monitoring.</P>
      <P>Unless mainland China's military activities are targeted at
Taiwan or its armed forces undergo abnormal deployment, the MND
said, it usually does not take the initiative to divulge details of
mainland military operations to avoid endangering its intelligence
sources.</P>
      <P>According to the Pentagon report, mainland China test-fired its
Dongfeng-31 missile over its territory on Nov. 4 when Gen. Henry
Shelton, chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, was visiting
the mainland as part of an effort to improve bilateral military
relations.</P>
      <P>It was the third flight test of the new missile since August
1999, the Pentagon report said, adding that two of the tests took
place this year. U.S. intelligence sources said that mainland China's
latest DF-31 missile test incorporated U.S. nuclear design
information allegedly obtained through espionage.</P>
      <P>U.S. Defense Department spokesman Kenneth Bacon said the DF-31
missile has a range of 8,000 kilometers, but the missile fired in
the latest testing didn't reach its maximum range.</P>
      <P>Bacon said mainland China began to develop the DF-31 missile in
the late 1980s. According to Bacon, the United States has
consistently paid close attention to mainland China's weaponry
development. He said mainland China's long-range ballistic missile
development plan cannot compete with similar projects in the United
States, Russia, Britain and France in terms of scale.</P>
      <P>Bacon didn't answer whether the DF-31 missile tested in the
November firing carried multi-warheads.</P>

    <HEADLINE>VP LU VISITS RESTING PLACES OF CHIANGS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 13 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu paid her respects
to the late Republic of China presidents Chiang Kai-shek and Chiang
Ching-kuo Wednesday by visiting their temporary mausoleums located in
the northern county of Taoyuan.</P>
      <P>Lu's unexpected visit to the mausoleum of the Generalissimo
located in Tzuhu and to the temporary resting place of the late
Chiang Ching-kuo in Touliao, only a few kilometers away, makes her
the highest-ranking official from the new government to visit the two
places, considered sacred sites by followers of the Kuomintang, which
lost power to the Democratic Progressive Party in this March's
presidential election.</P>
      <P>The vice president's visit to Tzuhu and Touliao also took the
staff members of the two establishments by surprise because she never
visited the two sites during her tenure as county head of Taoyuan. Lu
was Taoyuan County's magistrate before being elected the vice
president of the Republic of China this year.</P>
      <P>According to Lu's spokeswoman Tsai Ming-hua, the main purpose of
her visit to the two mausoleum establishments in Taoyuan County was
to probe the areas' tourism potential as the government is planning
to open Taiwan's doors to mainland Chinese tourists beginning next
June.</P>
      <P>Tzuhu is the third most popular choice in Taiwan in terms of
locations that mainland Chinese tourists would like to visit most,
after only Mt. Ali in southern Taiwan and Sun Moon Lake in central
Taiwan, according to a recent survey compiled by related agencies in
Beijing.</P>
      <P>Lu suggested that mainland Chinese tourists who visit Taiwan
could enter via Chiang Kai-shek International Airport in Taoyuan and
exit the island from Hsiaokang International Airport in the southern
city of Kaohsiung, or vice versa, thereby directly helping gear up
tourism development in the northern county of Taoyuan.</P>
      <P>Later in the day, Lu attended a seminar hosted by the Taoyuan
County government's Tourism Bureau on the topic of how Taoyuan can
grasp the opportunities to be created by the opening of Taiwan to
tourists from mainland China.</P>
      <P>Quoting a recent report which said that presently some 8 million
mainland Chinese citizens go abroad annually for tourism and that
some 28 million mainlanders would make Taiwan their top choice if
given the opportunity to visit abroad, Lu said the tourism potential
is immense when one considers that the second number is actually
greater than Taiwan's entire population of 23 million.</P>
      <P>During the seminar, Lu urged members of Taoyuan's tourism
industry, including travel agents and restaurant and hotel owners, to
establish a tourism promotion committee so as to grab the golden
business opportunities to be brought on by the government's policy of
opening Taiwan to mainland tourists.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOST MISSING CHILDREN CASES ARE RUNAWAYS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  13  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Most of the reported cases of missing
children in recent years are the result of children running away from
home rather than because of their being abducted as was the case in
the past, a children's right group announced Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The Child Welfare Legal Foundation made the remarks when
announcing a report on the missing children situation in Taiwan this
year.</P>
      <P>Foundation official Chen Chu-yeh said that among all the
youngsters who went missing between September 1992 and October 2000,
those aged between 12 and 18 accounted for the largest percentage,
with females outnumbering males. He added that most of the missing
children did not suffer from any sort of mental disabilities.</P>
      <P>In terms of the reported missing locations, Chen said that most
children who went missing did so from home or nearby locations,
accounting for 60 percent of the total.</P>
      <P>In terms of the ways of missing children who were found, a
quarter of the total were found due to a tip off or because the
children voluntarily returned home.</P>
      <P>He Hsiung-hua, who found his grandson through the assistance of
the foundation, also took part in the reunion party sponsored by the
foundation. He said that he lost six kilograms during the four months
when his grandson was missing.</P>
      <P>A father surnamed Chang, who said that his daughter Chang
Ching-ya has been missing for two years, and a Mrs. Chen, whose
daughter Chen Yi-tien has been missing for 12 years, said that they
still harbor the hope that their children will return to the family
fold someday.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CETRA GROUP PROMOTING EXPORT TRADE IN AUSTRALIA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  13  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Taiwan trade promotion group visiting
Australia has reaped an enviable harvest over the past two days,
receiving orders that could reach US$10 million, sources from the
China External Trade Development Council (CETRA) said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The CETRA trade promotion group, comprised of officials from the
Board of Foreign Trade and representatives from trade associations
and some 40 local export-oriented companies, met businessmen in
Sydney and Brisbane in separate workshops.</P>
      <P>In the Sydney workshop, the Taiwan group attracted executives and
representatives from some 240 Australian companies, resulting in
US$120,000-worth of orders placed on the spot, with follow-up
business opportunities expected to reach US$6 million in the coming
year, CETRA officials said.</P>
      <P>In Brisbane, the Taiwan group met delegates from 203 Australian
companies and received on-the-spot orders worth US$700,000, with
follow-up business estimated to reach US$3.4 million in the year to
come.</P>
      <P>The CETRA officials said the Taiwan trade promotion group was
organized in an attempt to redress the trade imbalance between Taiwan
and Australia, with Taiwan suffering a deficit of some US$1.2 billion
last year.</P>
      <P>Taiwan companies represented in the group include those producing
stationery, gifts, sporting goods, hardware, machinery, houseware,
gloves, socks, medical equipment, auto parts, computers and
telecommunications products.</P>
      <P>Two-way trade between Taiwan and Australia reached US$4.8 billion
in 1999, with Taiwan importing US$3 billion-worth of products from
Australia while exporting US$1.8 billion-worth of commodities down
under, leaving the island with a deficit of US$1.2 billion, according
to CETRA tallies.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and Australia have been complementary trade partners over
the years, with Taiwan exporting mainly industrial products to
Australia and Australia delivering mainly agricultural and industrial
raw materials, CETRA officials said.</P>
      <P>Between 1991 and 1998, bilateral trade grew 10.25 percent, with
Australia's exports to Taiwan surging 11.8 percent and Taiwan's
exports to Australia soaring 8.3 percent.</P>
      <P>After wrapping up their Australia trip, the CETRA group will
proceed to New Zealand to continue with its promotion of Taiwan
exports.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CABINET STANDS BY ITS STANCE ON PAY RAISES FOR CIVIL SERVANTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  13  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung reaffirmed
Wednesday that the Executive Yuan supports a pay raise for the
nation's civil servants.</P>
      <P>Chang made the remarks after the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) caucus in the Legislative Yuan proposed that a 3 percent
pay raise for government employees, military personnel and teachers
be suspended for a year in view of "the difficult financial
situation."</P>
      <P>Chang said that the Cabinet under his predecessor Tang Fei had
already begun to plan for the pay raise and that the proposal had
been carefully reviewed by the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Hsu Tien-tsai, DPP party whip in the Legislative Yuan, denied
Wednesday that the proposed suspension was aimed at "sounding out the
reaction" of the public.</P>
      <P>Hsu stressed that there is no political consideration in
proposing the suspended pay raise, saying that the DPP caucus did not
notify the executive branch.</P>
      <P>In view of the dire domestic financial situation, he said, the
proposal to ax the budget of NT$21 billion earmarked for the pay
raise would go ahead Monday as scheduled.</P>
      <P>Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng said that there are
advantages and disadvantages of the pay raise, but as the government
has made the raise its set policy, it is "odd" that the DPP
legislative caucus would have a different opinion.</P>
      <P>The main opposition Kuomintang blasted the DPP caucus for
attempting to suspend the pay raise, saying that it shows that the
DPP government's right hand does not know what its left is doing.</P>
      <P>Vice KMT Chairman Vincent Siew, presiding over a KMT Central
Standing Committee meeting Wednesday, did not say clearly whether or
not his party supports or opposes the DPP's idea.</P>
      <P>But he demanded that the DPP government adopt a clear and
consistent stance on various issues, saying that the ruling party has
been "rash in its policy making and has wavered along the way," on
various issues, resulting in loss of public confidence in the
government.</P>

    <HEADLINE>VP PITCHES FOR UNION OF ASIAN STATES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 13 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu pitched Wednesday
for the formation of a union of Asian states to ensure regional
prosperity and peace.</P>
      <P>Lu made the appeal in a speech delivered at the opening of the
2000 Asia-Europe Cooperation Forum, which brought together scores of
local and foreign scholars and experts to discuss regional security
issues and Asia-Pacific cooperation.</P>
      <P>Lu said she looks forward to seeing Asian states learn from the
15-member European Union and make issues of national and territorial
sovereignty secondary to achieving regional prosperity and peace.</P>
      <P>The vice president then reiterated her idea of forming a "union
of Asian states," which she said could serve to integrate the region
and give Asian nations a more effective role in world affairs.</P>
      <P>"It would also increase economic efficiency, enhance social
openness and promote peace in the region," Lu explained.</P>
      <P>Noting that the 21st century will dawn in just 19 days, Lu said
this is a moment for mankind to reflect on both the remarkable
achievements that have allowed humanity to enjoy unparalleled
progress and prosperity, and those appalling human errors that have
inflicted needless pain and loss on so many over the past century.</P>
      <P>Lu said that while the 20th century has been plagued by violence,
war, poverty, human rights abuses and gender inequality, at a heavy
cost to human dignity, equality, justice and peace, it has also had
many encouraging developments of common humanity and values.</P>
      <P>"The wave of democratization, the end of the Cold War and the
development of information technology have all contributed
tremendously to the advent of a global society," Lu said.</P>
      <P>She went on to predict that the world in the 21st century will be
an "open globe," where resource-sharing and cooperation are stressed.
"Thus, the United Nations, a half-century-old world body, should
catch up to this new reality," she said.</P>
      <P>For one thing, Lu said, the United Nations should stop practicing
the "politics of exclusion and discrimination" and should instead
embrace the "politics of inclusion, diversity, peace and love."</P>
      <P>Stressing that Taiwan is an open society and a true democracy,
although it is recognized by only 29 out of 189 U.N. member states,
Lu said: "In the new century's `open world,' it is absolutely absurd
for the United Nations to remain deaf and blind to Taiwan's
existence."</P>
      <P>Lu recalled that former South African President Nelson Mandela
once said: "You don't make peace by talking to your friends, you
have to make peace with your enemies."</P>
      <P>"But it is surely just as important to maintain peace with your
friends and neighbors. I think the ultimate aim of the current forum
is both to make peace and maintain it," she added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A documentary on Taiwan's wild birds has
made the short list for a nature and wildlife award in the New York
Festival 2000.</P>
      <P>The film, titled "Feathered Glory: Wild Birds on Taiwan," was
chosen from among more than 3,000 entries to make the short list. The
film follows the lives of more than 40 wild birds in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chung Jung-feng, the maker of the film, said the work is the
culmination of his 13-year career as a wildlife cameraman and took
him more than a year to shoot and edit.</P>
      <P>Perhaps most noticeable among the 40-odds birds featured in the
work are the migratory gray-faced vultures, black-faced spoonbills
and terns.</P>
      <P>With an area of 36,000 square kilometers, Taiwan is home to about
500 species of birds, giving the island the distinction of being the
world's second-densest bird habitat in terms of species per square
kilometer, according to Chung.</P>
      <P>The New York Festival, set up in 1957, has this year attracted
3,732 entries from 38 countries. The winners will be announced Jan.

    <HEADLINE>CABINET APPROVES DRAFT RULES FOR TRANSPORT LINKS WITH MAINLAND CHINA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  13  (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Executive Yuan approved Wednesday a
draft of rules governing the implementation of trial transport links
scheduled to be established between Taiwan's outlying Kinmen and
Matsu islands and mainland China beginning Jan. 1, 2001.</P>
      <P>According to government spokesman Su Cheng-ping, only an outline
of the rules is provided at this time because the Legislative Yuan
has yet to evaluate and vote on the draft.</P>
      <P>The actual rules will be divided into 36 guidelines on the
application procedures for ships wishing to travel between the two
areas, the designated routes, vessel identification and
communication, and port authority affairs, according to a Cabinet
press release.</P>
      <P>Entry and departure application procedures, permissible intent,
duration of stay, trading methods, commodity imports and exports,
quarantine inspections and port safety restrictions are also
addressed by the rules, the release notes.</P>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council Vice Chairman Teng Chen-chung revealed
at a press conference later in the day that all ships entering or
leaving the outlying islands will need to submit applications for
either regularly or irregularly scheduled routes.</P>
      <P>Teng said that those on the islands who wish to travel directly
to mainland China must show that they have already resided on the
islands for a certain period of time. He added that all business
transactions must be carried out in new Taiwan dollars.</P>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung said at a Cabinet meeting where he
approved the implementation measures that the "mini three links" --
direct trade, postal, and transport links between the two outlying
islands and designated ports in mainland China -- are a major
national policy.</P>
      <P>He went on to say that the links are also a major measure
involving "a big step forward" that will allow the nation to attain
stable and harmonious cross-Taiwan Strait relations.</P>
      <P>This measure must be implemented under "sound principles," he
said, adding that "it must not fail."</P>
      <P>Chang said that the issues eliciting the most concern during the
implementation of the "mini three links" will be national security
and public security in Kinmen and Matsu, which lie much closer to
mainland China than Taiwan. The shortest distance from the main
Kinmen island to communist-held territory is only 2.3 kilometers.</P>
      <P>With only around 200 police officers on Kinmen and Matsu
combined, he added, the Ministry of National Defense, the Ministry of
the Interior, and the Coast Guard Administration will "spare no
effort" to assist in maintaining the islands' security.</P>

comment on Formosa Group founder Wang Yung-ching's statement that
"the new government is inferior to the old government, and the new
generation of the Democratic Progressive Party is inferior to the old

      <P>Lin acknowledged that he was not sure whether Wang had made such
a statement, but pointed out that the new government had inherited
everything from the old government without any complaint.</P>
      <P>He stressed that the new government should be given more time to

      <P>Wang has been urging the new government to start full-scale

      <P>Lee Ching-hsiung of the Taiwan Independence Party asked Lin about
his view on United Microelectronics Corp.'s plan to invest US$2.5-3
billion in a semiconductor wafer fabrication plant in Singapore.</P>
      <P>Lin said that UMC has its own global strategy, and noted that
Singapore provides tax incentives for foreign investors.</P>
      <P>Lee said that the Taiwan government should work to improve its

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Education (MOE) will
organize a delegation to conduct a fact-finding visit to mainland
China in preparation for recognizing its academic qualifications,
Education Minister Ovid Tzeng said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Tzeng said as recognizing mainland China's academic accreditation
involves many complicated problems, the MOE has decided to form a
special task force to carefully study all relevant issues.</P>
      <P>Tzeng said Vice Education Minister Lu Mu-lin will head the new
study team to be composed of scholars, experts and educators. In the
past, the MOE once proposed a list of 73 mainland colleges and
universities whose academic accreditation might be recognized by
the Republic of China government.</P>
      <P>The list was later shelved due to opposition from some social
quarters. With the number of Taiwan students traveling to the
mainland to receive college education increasing rapidly in recent
years, the appeal for the government to recognize mainland academic
accreditation has risen loudly again.</P>
      <P>Against this background, Tzeng said the MOE is seriously mulling
the accreditation issue.</P>
      <P>Initially, Tzeng said, the new MOE task force will review the
current situations of the 73 mainland colleges or universities
included in the previous list.</P>
      <P>Tzeng said many mainland colleges and universities have been
undergoing merger in recent years. "The task force will look into
how these schools have been merged or re-organized as well as their
curricula, teaching facilities and student performance evaluation
systems," he explained.</P>
      <P>The minister stressed that the MOE will play a leading role in
deciding which mainland school's academic accreditation will be
recognized.</P>
      <P>As for the timing of recognition, Tzeng said the MOE will
discuss with the Mainland Affairs Council, which charts Taiwan's
policy toward mainland China, and the National Security Council
before deciding when to begin recognizing mainland China's academic
qualifications.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China's leading liberal voice,
Li Rui-huan, has set off fresh speculation about high-level factional
disputes in Beijing over the pace and direction of political reform
with a bold appeal for more popular democracy, according to the
December 21 issue of the Far Eastern Economic Review.</P>
      <P>An advance copy of the report reveals that Li, speaking at the
end of a three-day conference with non-communist political groups in
Beijing on December 6, said that economic reform has created a
diversity of interests in the mainland.</P>
      <P>"It is very hard for a single measure that is promulgated to
benefit everybody equally, as there are invariably those who are for
it and those who are against it," he was quoted as saying.</P>
      <P>"Such a complex and changeable state of society is bound to have

      <P>The solution, he reportedly said, was for the ruling Chinese
Communist Party (CCP) to "open up and unclog the democratic channels
through which the masses from all walks of life can express their
views."</P>
      <P>That meant the need to "expand the citizens' orderly
participation in political affairs," he was further quoted as saying.</P>
      <P>According to the Review, Li's remarks contrasted sharply with the
hardline comments of CCP chief Jiang Zemin, who reportedly said at

    <HEADLINE>KMT LEGISLATOR SUGGESTS TRIAL VOYAGE BETWEEN KINMEN, MAINLAND CHINA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 13 (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Kuomintang (KMT) legislator Chen Ching-pao
said Wednesday that a trial voyage between Kinmen and mainland China
should be undertaken before the "mini three links" are officially
established in order to avoid cold treatment by mainland China.</P>
      <P>Chen pointed out that Taipei and Beijing have yet to begin
negotiations on the issue of opening direct trade, postal, and
transport links between Taiwan's outlying Kinmen and Matsu islands
and mainland China, raising concerns that a maiden voyage scheduled
for Jan. 1, 2001 may encounter difficult political waters.</P>
      <P>He added that the problem is especially evident after Cabinet
Secretary-General Chiou I-jen said that until bilateral negotiations
are held, mainland ships will not be allowed to enter Kinmen or
Matsu, and that mainland Chinese residents will only be allowed to
travel to the islands on Taiwan-registered vessels.</P>
      <P>Chen, who represents the Kinmen constituency, said that the "mini
three links" should be a new beginning in the development of
cross-Taiwan Strait relations, and not a point of resurgent conflict.</P>
      <P>The trial voyage could take place between Dec. 25 and Dec. 27, he
said, adding that Mainland Affairs Council Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen
has told him that she agrees with the concept in principle, but that
coming up with a concrete course of action will require further
discussion.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, KMT legislator Chang Chin-fang urged Taipei and
Beijing to return to the negotiating table to work out the many
concrete measures needed for the establishment of the "mini three
links."</P>
      <P>However, Chen and Chang recommended that before bilateral
negotiations resume, the government should concentrate on ironing out
issues of entry into and departure from Kinmen and Matsu, as well as
restrictions, possible social problems and tariffs.</P>
      <P>They suggested that mainland Chinese residents who wish to enter
Kinmen or Matsu be made to apply for entry through Taiwan travel
agencies or through their relatives in Taiwan. They added that
visitors should be required to hold round-trip tickets to ensure
their compliance with the limitations on their duration of stay, with
violators of such limitations subject to forced repatriation.</P>
      <P>They urged the government to remove the restriction in its draft
of the implementation rules that limits visitation rights to
residents of mainland China's Fujian province. Chen and Chang said
that removing the restriction would bring about more trade and
tourism, and that enforcing the original rule would add to the
difficulties by crossing into mainland China's jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>Regarding possible social problems that may surface after the
"mini three links" are established, they suggested that the police
force on the offshore islands be increased, and that the activities
and movements of the mainland visitors be carefully monitored to
prevent any illegal activities.</P>
      <P>They also urged the government to establish a tariff-free zone in
Kinmen and Matsu, allow the islands to use raw materials from
mainland China to develop their industries, and improve the tourism
and service industries on the islands.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Lu Li-hsing, president of DHL Taiwan Corp.,
said Wednesday that his company has recently completed two more
large-scale service centers which will speed up its island-wide
transport of commodities.</P>
      <P>Under the NT$1 billion investment plan, five large-scale service
centers have been in operation since early this year, Lu noted.</P>
      <P>This indicates that DHL Taiwan will not change its plan to extend
its roots in Taiwan, said Lu, although the firm's air cargo and
express section has complained about discriminatory treatment by the
Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC).</P>
      <P>A DHL Taiwan official in charge of the air cargo and express
section claimed that the MOTC has been providing better treatment to
two U.S. firms -- FedEx and UPS.</P>
      <P>Owing to the discriminatory treatment, he said, DHL Taiwan will
give up its plan to establish a trans-shipping operations center in
Taiwan, and will consider setting up the center in Hong Kong -- a
move that will cost Taiwan some 500 jobs and tens of millions of U.S.
dollars in investment.</P>

    <DATELINE>Beijing,  Dec.  13 ((CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan has the edge over mainland China
in wafer foundry manufacturing, according to Morris Chang, founder of
the world's largest semiconductor foundry manufacturer, Taiwan
Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC).</P>
      <P>The scale of the wafer foundry industry in mainland China pales
in comparison with that of Taiwan, which enjoys an advantage over
mainland China because of its abundant manpower resources, Chang
said.</P>
      <P>Chang said that he had traveled to mainland China only to attend
an international bridge tournament. He said that although mainland
China has greatly improved its level of technology in recent years by
offering attractive incentives to woo Chinese experts from Silicon
Valley, he is optimistic about Taiwan's investment environment.</P>
      <P>Chang said that instead of venturing into mainland China as many
Taiwan firms have, TSMC will concentrate its expansion on southern
Taiwan's Tainan Science-based Industrial Park, at least for the next
three or four years.</P>
      <P>He said he wouldn't rule out meeting with Beijing officials
during his stay, if asked by them. However, he stressed that his main
reason for traveling to Beijing was to attend the bridge game, and
given the tight schedule at the tournament, any such meeting could
only take place over breakfast.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN TRANSPORTERS CRAVING DIRECT CROSS-TAIWAN STRAIT TRAFFIC (I)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 13 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Aiming at the huge profits to be gained by
the establishment of direct transport ties across the Taiwan Strait,
local aviation firms have been gearing up to set up strongholds in
mainland China, according to industry sources.</P>
      <P>Although the government is planning to first open the so-called
direct "mini three links" between Taiwan-controlled Kinmen and Matsu
islands and certain mainland Chinese ports, the sources said
Taiwan-based airlines are keenly engaged in preparations for the full
opening of direct transport links between the two sides by
setting up representative offices in the mainland.</P>
      <P>As direct cross-strait traffic will noticeably reduce operation
costs and travel time for Taiwan-based carriers such as China
Airlines (CAL), EVA Airways Corp. (EVA AIR), and Far East Air
Transport Corp. (FEAT), share prices of all rose by about 10 percent
late November on the Taiwan stock market.</P>
      <P>According to a FEAT executive, the aviation company, which only
operates domestic routes at present, has decided to increase its
daily flights between Taipei and Kinmen from four to five, amid the
expectation that the implementation of the "mini three links" will
also significantly boost cargo and passenger traffic volume between
the offshore islands and Taiwan proper.</P>
      <P>The FEAT executive said that his company has already readied
itself for full direct links between Taiwan and the mainland and
added that its current fleet of Boeing 757 airplanes used on domestic
flight routes is also suitable to fly cross-strait routes.</P>
      <P>The much-anticipated opening of full transport links between the
two sides of the strait are expected to generate at least NT$30-NT$40
billion-worth of business opportunities, providing a major fillip for
local carriers, he added.</P>
      <P>Lagging behind only CAL, FEAT is the second Taiwan-based aviation
company to have obtained approval from mainland China's civil
aeronautics authorities for repair and maintenance of mainland
Chinese airplanes, and has already opened an office in the mainland.</P>
      <P>In a recent meeting of shareholders, FEAT, which has long been
preparing to make inroads into the mainland, also made a decision to
invest NT$35 million (US$1.1 million) in the mainland's air cargo and
passenger transport industry and related businesses, in the hope of
gaining an upper hand in the lucrative market.</P>
      <P>Although the implementation of the "mini three links" slated for
the beginning of next year will be of limited help to CAL and EVA
Air, both of which ply mainly international routes, industry experts
said the Taiwan's two largest carriers will benefit from the full
direct transport ties across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Both CAL and EVA Air maintain representative offices in mainland
China.

    <TEXT>
      <P>According to industry sources, the first freedom, which
Taiwan-based aviation firms will enjoy after the opening of direct
cross-strait airlinks, will markedly help reduce fuel costs and
flying time for local carriers on their routes to European
destinations.</P>
      <P>In addition, the granting of the third, fourth and fifth freedoms
will allow local carriers to fly directly to their destinations in
the mainland without having to pass through Hong Kong, helping
realize a reduction in operation costs of 75 percent and 62.5 percent
for the Taipei-Fuzhou and Taipei-Xiamen routes, respectively, and a
40 percent slash for the Taipei-Beijing route.</P>
      <P>At the same time, the local shipping industry is also strongly
urging the government to ease its current "no haste, be patient"
mainland investment policy by allowing direct full transport ties
between the two sides.</P>
      <P>Evergreen Marine Corp. (Taiwan) Ltd., which operates the world's
largest container fleet, has repeatedly called on the government to
permit full transport links between Taiwan and the mainland, rather
than just setting up partial relations between certain ports across
the strait.</P>
      <P>According to industry sources, local shipping companies all
harbor similar hopes, which it is believed will enable them to work
out more adequate and efficient shipping schedules, substantially
reducing transshipment costs and allowing them to chalk up greater
profits.</P>
      <P>At present, Hong Kong is the transshipment center for exports
from and imports to mainland China's central and southern provinces,
while South Korea is the hub for outbound shipments from and inbound
shipments to the mainland's central and northern regions. Japan,
Europe, the United States and Southeast Asian countries are the
leading outlets for mainland Chinese products, the sources noted.</P>
      <P>The mainland's shipping market, which deals with at least 10
million TEUs (twenty-foot equivalent units) annually, is growing at a
double-digit rate each year, the sources added.</P>
      <P>Taking as an example Yangming Marine Transport Corp., which has
set up eight offices in the mainland in the last seven years, it is
only able to handle 250,000-300,000 TEUs annually, accounting for
just 0.25 percent or 0.3 percent of the total, the sources said.</P>
      <P>Given the fact that Taiwan businessmen in the mainland generate
most business opportunities for Taiwan-headquartered shipping
companies there, a Yangming executive was cited as saying that his
company will head for wherever there are Taiwan businessmen.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's renowned Buddhist leader Master
Hsing Yun and mainland China's top official in charge of religion Ye
Xiaowen reached four points of consensus when they met on Tuesday,
according to Hsing Yun's Fokuangshan Temple in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Ye, who is director of mainland China's State Bureau of Religious
Affairs, was quoted as saying in the meeting that if the two sides of
the Taiwan Strait are going to establish direct trade, postal, and
transport links in the future, then the religious sector might as
well spearhead the initiative -- as long as everything is done under
the principle of "one China."</P>
      <P>Responding to Ye, Hsing Yun urged mainland China to "peacefully
co-exist" with Taiwan in a "rational and gentle" manner and insisted
that Beijing should never resort to the use of force against Taiwan.
"Chinese do not fight Chinese," he stressed.</P>
      <P>The consensus included a promise from Ye to help bring a
treasured mainland Chinese religious artifact to Taiwan for
exhibition. The artifact, said to be a finger salvaged from the
Buddha's ashes after his cremation 2,000 years ago, has never been
displayed outside mainland China since its archeological discovery 12
years ago.</P>
      <P>Mainland China also owns one of the three legendary Sacred Teeth
of Buddha. In 1998, a Tibetan monk in exile in India donated another
to Hsing Yun, whose Buddha's Light International Association is the
world's largest Buddhist organization.</P>
      <P>Ye also promised that his bureau would be willing to help
Fokuangshan set up a university in mainland China. The Buddhist
organization has already established Fokuang University in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Hsing Yun and Ye also agreed to continue to promote the
mainland's bid to hold the next World Buddhist Friendship Convention
in Beijing.</P>
      <P>Lastly, Ye said that he hopes a volume on academic research into
Chinese Buddhism currently being compiled by Fokuangshan will be
allowed to be published in Beijing.</P>
      <P>At the invitation of Fukuang University, five officials of Ye's
bureau had visited Taiwan in 1998, when they toured various religious
centers, temples, and churches for the purpose of cross-Taiwan Strait
religious exchanges.</P>

(By David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC) has
decided to conduct an investigation in the near future into the
alleged dumping of hot-rolled steel exported to the United States
from 11 countries, including Taiwan, the Board of Foreign Trade
(BOFT) under the Ministry of Economic Affairs said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The BOFT noted that 11 U.S. steel manufacturers had lodged
dumping charges against Taiwan manufacturers of hot-rolled steel
sheeting, hot-rolled steel alloys, and electromagnetic steel
sheeting.</P>
      <P>U.S. steel manufacturers charged Taiwan manufacturers with
dumping their hot-rolled steel products on the U.S. market at prices
some 16 percent to 50 percent cheaper than those of the same products
made by U.S. manufacturers.</P>
      <P>Other countries also charged with dumping hot-rolled steel by the
U.S. side include Argentina, mainland China, India, Indonesia,
Kazakhstan, Holland, Romania, South Africa, Thailand and the Ukraine.</P>
      <P>The BOFT indicated that the sharp increase of U.S. imports of
Taiwan steel products had aroused the U.S. side's concerns.</P>
      <P>In addition to hot-rolled steel products, the U.S. side has
warned Taiwan's steel manufacturers to take care not to dump other
types of steel on the U.S. market, or risk having these products
targeted during the next wave of anti-dumping investigations in the
United States.</P>
      <P>According to U.S. Commerce of Department's statistics, from 1998
to the first eight months of 2000, exports of Taiwan's hot-rolled
steel to the United States grew by 76.4 percent to 366 percent, with
sales volumes increasing from US$50 million to US$170 million.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ALUMNUS DONATES CHIP CENTER TO CHUNGSHING UNIVERSITY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taichung,  Dec.  14  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An exceptional alumnus of National
Chungshing University and the founder of a U.S.-based high technology
company donated a chip center to his Alma Mater Wednesday, marking
what he called his "tiny" contribution to the most prestigious
university in central Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Gerald Hsu, chairman, CEO, and president of the Fremont,
Calif.-based Avant! Hi-Tech Corp., handed the key to the US$23
million Meng Yao Chip Center to the president of NCU, Peng Tso-kwei,
in a ceremony held at the newly-founded chip center located on the
university's campus.</P>
      <P>The Meng Yao Chip Center, expected to serve as a cradle for the
IC industry and specialists in central Taiwan, marks the biggest
donation ever made by any individual to their Alma Mater in Taiwan's
history.</P>
      <P>Making an address at the donation ceremony, Hsu, who owns and
runs one of the leading EDA (electronic design automation) companies
in the world, said the chip center should serve only as a starter
that will induce more alumnae to offer feedback to Chungshing
University so as to help in the development of the institute.</P>
      <P>"We will starve to death if we only rely on subsidies from the
government," he added.</P>
      <P>Expressing his appreciation to Hsu for the donation, Peng said
the establishment of the chip center promises to turn Taichung into
Taiwan's third science-based industrial park, after the Hsinchu
Science-based Industrial Park in northern Taiwan and the Tainan
Science-based Industrial Park in southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The Meng Yao Chip Center, which is named after Hsu's father,
comes equipped with a laboratory using Avant!'s design facilities and
know-how, two operation centers containing two high-speed servers and
30 Sun operation stations, and an Internet video conference center.</P>
      <P>Avant! Hi-Tech Corp., a leading EDA firm, which maintains 60
affiliates and offshoot companies in 17 countries around the world,
established its first affiliate in Asia in Shanghai this past
October.</P>
      <P>Although the company sees mainalnd China's market potential as
immense, Hsu said he chose to help Taiwan to gear up further, adding
that "Taiwan is where I'm from."</P>
      <P>Hard-work is Hsu's motto for success and the only advice that he
gave to his young alumnae, pointing out that his enterprise kingdom
has been built with tears and sweat.</P>
      <P>Graduating from Chungshing University's Applied Mathematics
Department in 1968, Hsu left for the United States in 1970 to study
after finishing two years of mandatory military service in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>With only US$700 to his name, he went on to study hydromechanics
at Iowa University and obtained a bachelor's degree two years later.
He graduated at a time when America was experiencing an oil crisis
and economic depression. In this setting, none of the 290 job
applications his wife typed up and sent out received a response, like
"stones falling into the ocean."</P>
      <P>Despite the financial strains he and his wife were experiencing,
they moved to the East Coast and still aimed to fulfill his dream of
entering the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.</P>
      <P>Ten years later, after earning stature in the business world with
a master's degree from MIT, his graduate school director told Hsu
that he had been accepted into MIT's Institute of Structural
Engineering program because the director had been moved by Hsu's
"super strong ambition and salesman characteristics."</P>
      <P>As a poor foreign student, Hsu said he did any humble job he
could, such as washing over 1,000 toilets in nine months or working
for as little as US$2 per hour, just to make ends meet.</P>
      <P>Hsu said that he retains his work ethic to this day, adding that
it's normal for him these days to work 80 to 100 hours per week
without taking a break on weekends.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC FOREIGN MINISTER HAILS BUSH'S VICTORY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  14  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Foreign Minister Tien Hung-mao said
Thursday he is pleased to see Republican candidate George W. Bush
win the cliffhanger 2000 U.S. presidential election.</P>
      <P>Fielding questions at a meeting of the Legislative Yuan's Foreign
Affairs Committee, Tien said although he failed to meet Bush in
person during his U.S. visit in November, he managed to meet with
Bush's senior advisers in private.</P>
      <P>Tien told lawmakers that he had taken advantage of those
meetings to gain a better understanding of the major directions of
possible future U.S. policies toward the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait.</P>
      <P>"Of course, I had also clearly informed Bush's advisers of our
government's views and stances on cross-Taiwan Strait relations,"
Tien explained.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Tien said he got an impression during his U.S. visit
that the United States attaches great importance to the "three
acknowledgments and four recommendations" presented recently by the
Republic of China's cross-party presidential advisory group on the
development of cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>"Even though not all Americans I met agreed with those
proposals, some of them threw explicit support behind the advisory
group's 'acknowledgments and recommendations,'" Tien said.</P>
      <P>The minister further said he is convinced that U.S.
President-elect Bush will deal with cross-Taiwan Strait issues with a
positive attitude.</P>
      <P>Tien also said he thinks that the views of Bush's advisers on
Taiwan are quite positive.</P>
      <P>Responding to opposition Kuomintang Legislator Chen Shei-saint's
claim that Vice President Annette Lu's recent remarks on
cross-strait issues have caused Beijing's unhappy reaction, Tien
said the ROC should avoid taking any provocative action as local
people want peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Tien added that peace and stability are also in the U.S. interest
in the Asia-Pacific region.</P>
      <P>In related news, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs cabled
warm congratulations Thursday to U.S. President-elect Bush and his
running mate Dick Cheney.</P>
      <P>The ministry said in its messages that substantive ROC-U.S.
relations have grown steadily on the basis of mutual trust and
reciprocity in recent years.</P>
      <P>The ministry went on to point out that U.S. President Bill
Clinton's 1994 Taiwan policy review has brought about some
improvements in bilateral engagements.</P>
      <P>It also recalled Washington's "firm action" during the 1996
Taiwan Strait crisis when mainland China conducted missile tests and
live-fire military exercises ahead of Taiwan's first presidential
election. At the height of the crisis, the ministry said, the U.S.
government had demonstrated its determination to maintain peace and
security in the area by dispatching two aircraft carrier battle
groups to waters near the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>"We believe that there should be ample room for our two
countries to further expand cooperation on the basis of traditional
friendship, mutual trust and reciprocity since we have common ideals
of pursuing democracy and human rights and share common interests in
peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region," the ministry added
in its messages.</P>
      <P>Bush won the U.S. presidency after Democratic rival Al Gore
conceded defeat following a Supreme Court decision halting vote
recounts in the key state of Florida.</P>

    <HEADLINE>VICE PRESIDENT TO FILE CIVIL SUIT AGAINST LOCAL MAGAZINE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 14 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu will file a civil
suit against a local magazine over its reports implicating her in a
scandal, Lu's legal team announced on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Lu's six-member legal team and 13 legal advisers -- including her
elder brother Lu Chuan-sheng -- also said that it will not rule out
pressing a criminal case against The Journalist and asking for
compensation of NT$100 million (US$3.02 million).</P>
      <P>However, the legal team stressed that the attitude of the weekly
will be a major factor in their decision on whether to press criminal
charges against it later.</P>
      <P>On Dec. 4, the team demanded that the magazine openly apologize
by Dec. 10 over what it claimed to be "obviously false and malicious"
reporting on Lu. But The Journalist only responded with a Dec. 8
letter in which the legal team found the weekly was trying to
"distort the definition of press freedom," and "mislead the general
public" without any kind of reflection on the ethical code of
professional journalists, the team said.</P>
      <P>Therefore, the legal team made the announcement to pursue the
legal action after a discussion Wednesday night.</P>
      <P>The team said in Thursday's statement that Lu had originally
wanted to avoid a laborious legal battle and forgive the magazine --
following its open apology -- because she is "always kind to others."
But there is no other choice now but to go to court to solicit legal
justice and clear the damaged names of the vice president, the legal
experts said.</P>
      <P>The team claimed that the weekly printed a "libelous" cover
headline and story that accused the vice president of spreading
rumors about an alleged extramarital affair between President Chen
Shui-bian and a female aide. The team also accused the magazine of
alleging that Lu wanted to use the presidential scandal to "finish
off" the president.</P>
      <P>The headline reads: "The person who stirred up the scandal and is
secretly competing with the president unexpectedly turned out to be
Annette Lu."</P>
      <P>President Chen said in a Nov. 16 news release that he "has
absolute faith in the vice president" and does not think that she is
the source of the rumors.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, The Journalist, which had earlier stood by it reports,
showed no sign of budging and responded by saying that it is ready to
face the legal procedure.</P>
      <P>Wang Chien-chuang, president of The Journalist, said that over
the past six weeks, the magazine has mostly been concerned about
press freedom, professional journalism, and journalistic ethics. He
added that its credo is now on the line in the legal battle.</P>
      <P>Wang also said in a press conference that a national leader
filing charges against a magazine sets a "bad example" for the
democratic and constitutional history of the nation.</P>
      <P>Wang said that no political figure, especially a national leader,
should try to cover up their mistakes, which he said would only lead
to a dead end, examples of which abound in other countries.</P>
      <P>Wang claimed that The Journalist's articles on the vice
president's alleged spreading of rumors are accurate, adding that
more and more evidence has surfaced over the past month that proves
the authenticity of its reports.</P>
      <P>He stressed that the magazine has remained passive over the past
month, despite what he called the emotional and insulting remarks by
the vice president and her legal team. He added that it will now
adopt a more aggressive attitude toward the legal procedure.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BUSH'S VICTORY SHOULD BE A PLUS FOR TAIPEI STOCK MARKET: MANAGERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 14 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Convinced that George W. Bush's election as
the next president of the United States will have little impact on
Taiwan's economy, some foreign securities consulting firms operating
in Taipei believe that the Bush victory will nevertheless be a plus
for the local stock market.</P>
      <P>Taiwan stands to benefit more from a Bush victory, as the U.S.
president-elect has touted a more powerful tax cut than his rival Al
Gore -- over US$1 trillion against some US$40 million. Bush's victory
will benefit the U.S. stock market temporarily at least, helping to
fuel the American economy, which will eventually be beneficial for
Taiwan's bourse, said Andrew Lin, vice president of Jardine Fleming
Taiwan Securities.</P>
      <P>Bush's election is expected to result in little change to overall
U.S.-China relations and cross-Taiwan Strait ties, but its impact on
Taiwan will be more positive than negative, Lin noted. In addition,
Republicans have been traditionally been friendlier to Taiwan than
Democrats, he pointed out.</P>
      <P>He said it is still too early to speculate on whether foreign
capital will flow from Taiwan to mainland China in the wake of the
victory of the Texas governor.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Wu Yi-hsun, president of UBS Warburg Securities'
Taipei branch, said the results of the U.S. presidential election
will have little influence on the Taipei stock market.</P>
      <P>Although Washington's Taiwan Strait policy has a direct influence
on Taiwan, little change has been seen in the policy so far, Wu said.
Since the United States' foreign policy has to have continuity and is
primarily controlled by Congress, whoever is in the White House
office actually makes little difference to it, he said.</P>

    <DATELINE>Hsinchu,  Dec.  14  (CNA)
(By Edward Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>U.S. air carrier American Airlines (AA)
has announced that it will open a direct air link between Taiwan and
San Jose, California. The move is expected to strengthen the
interchange of information and personnel between Hsinchu
Science-based Industrial Park and Silicon Valley.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for AA said that the maiden voyage will take place on
April 1, 2001.</P>
      <P>Currently, if a visitor wants to visit Silicon Valley, the U.S.
high-technology industrial center, he must first fly to either San
Franciso or Tokyo before transferring to a flight bound for San Jose.</P>
      <P>The spokesman said that some 300 high tech companies in Silicon
Valley have close relations with firms in Taiwan's Hsinchu
Science-based Industrial Park, which was the deciding factor behind
the airline's decision to open a direct air link between Taiwan and

plane will fly from San Jose to Taipei on April 1 and return to San
Jose on April 2.</P>
      <P>The Taipei-San Jose route will expand AA's direct air services to
Silicon Valley. The firm already maintains direct flights between
Tokyo and San Jose.</P>
      <P>The new route is seen as an indication that the tremendous

    <HEADLINE>KINMEN MAGISTRATE SPEAKS ON 'THREE MINI LINKS'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  14 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Chen Shui-tsai, magistrate of the outpost
island of Kinmen, said Thursday that the government's proposed "three
mini links" has focused more on plugging up loopholes than seeking
benefits for Kinmen people.</P>
      <P>Chen criticized the regulation mandating that only people who
have been registered as residents of Kinmen and Matsu for more than
six months will be allowed to engage in direct transport with the
mainland, saying that it should be eased.</P>
      <P>Direct transport refers to one of the three "mini links," the
other two being direct trade and postal links across the Taiwan
Strait.</P>
      <P>He said that the roughly 200,000 people originally from Kinmen
who now reside on Taiwan proper, as well as the 300,000-odd Kinmen
natives who live overseas, should also be able to enjoy the same
rights.</P>
      <P>He said that he will continue to discuss the issue with the
central government.</P>
      <P>He noted that the first stage of implementing the "three mini
links" between the outlying islands of Kinmen and Matsu and selected
mainland ports will be to legalize the existing small-scale trade
with the mainland, and the second stage will be to allow larger-scale
commercial trade.</P>
      <P>Noting that the central government has yet to set a timetable for
the second-stage works, he urged it to step up its preparations.</P>
      <P>Chen also suggested that the number of mainland tourists allowed
to travel to Kinmen every day be increased to 1,500 from 700 during
the second stage of the links, which he said would stimulate Kinmen's
tourism industry.</P>
      <P>Chen also said that the government should encourage Taiwan
businessmen to set up plants in Kinmen and make use of cheap raw
materials from the mainland for reprocessing and re-exporting, and
even introducing mainland laborers so as to upgrade the competitive
edge of Taiwan businesses.</P>
      <P>Chen also said that in the long term, the government should
consider declaring Kinmen a special peace zone between the two sides
of the Taiwan Strait, so that the outlying island would enjoy the
benefits of peace and cross-strait trade.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT CHEN INSPECTS CHIASHAN AIR BASE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 14 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian made an inspection
tour of the Chiashan Air Base in eastern Taiwan Thursday to gain a
better understanding of the Republic of China Air Force's "command,
control, communications and intelligence" operations.</P>
      <P>This was the first time that Chen has inspected the
maximum-security Chiashan air base since he took office in Taiwan's
first democratic transfer of power between different political
parties in May.</P>
      <P>Chen was accompanied on the inspection tour by Chief of the
General Staff Gen. Tang Yao-ming and Air Force Commander-in-Chief
Gen. Chen Chao-min.</P>
      <P>Air force sources said that President Chen, also the
commander-in-chief of the ROC's armed forces, monitored mainland
Chinese military aircraft's real-time movements through the Sky Net
System, and inspected the ROC air force's precautionary measures and
combat preparedness in the face of the potential mainland military
threat.</P>
      <P>Chiashan is one of Taiwan's most important air bases for
counterattacking after a "first strike" by mainland China. It can
withstand a direct hit by a traditional missile and a
6-plus-magnitude earthquake.</P>
      <P>The air base is also equipped with facilities to protect itself
from attacks by nuclear, biological and chemical weapons. With an
immense interior, the base can accommodate hundreds of warplanes of
various types.</P>
      <P>Air Force Commander-in-Chief Gen. Chen Chao-min told President
Chen that the Chiashan Air Base's main function is to preserve
"combat power" for launching counterattacks on enemy forces.</P>
      <P>"Once our air bases in western Taiwan were struck by the enemy's
first-wave attack, some warplanes deployed at those bases would be
flown to Chiashan upon receiving orders from the air force operations
command," Gen. Chen explained.</P>
      <P>Construction on the Chiashan air base began in January 1985 and
was completed in December 1993, with a price tag of NT$27.29 billion
(US$826.97 million).</P>
      <P>The air base has an anti-flood system as well as comprehensive
power generation, water, fire, communication, medical, air
conditioning, security and emergency power supply systems. Each of
its exits is equipped with a protective steel door.</P>
      <P>To demonstrate the Chiashan Air Base's emergency combat
capabilities, the air force arranged for a squadron of jet fighters
to fly to the air base from other military bases. Several warplanes
stationed at Chiashan scrambled to escort fighters to safely land at
the base.</P>
      <P>After watching the emergency flight demonstration, President Chen
had lunch with officers and men stationed at the Chiashan Air Base to
boost their morale.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIPEI, BEIJING NOT EXPECTED TO ENTER WTO NEXT SPRING: U.S. OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Dec.  14  (CNA)
(By Herman Pan and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The chances of the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait entering the World Trade Organization (WTO) next spring
have become slim, a senior U.S. trade official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Assistant United States Trade Representative Donald M. Phillip
made the remarks while briefing the Republic of China's
representative office in the United States on the just-concluded 14th
screening meeting of the WTO working party in charge of mainland
China's membership bid.</P>
      <P>Phillip told ROC representative office staff that the working
party is scheduled to meet again in Geneva from Jan. 10-17, 2001.</P>
      <P>"And that meeting is not expected to be the last one," Phillip
said, adding that the working party will have to meet one more time
or two to finalize negotiations with mainland China.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, Phillip said, Taiwan's WTO entry will be
delayed due to the slow progress in the world trade regulatory body's
multilateral negotiations concerning mainland China's accession
terms. It is a WTO consensus that Taiwan and mainland China will be
admitted to the body simultaneously, so although Taiwan has long
finalized bilateral and multilateral negotiations, it must wait for
mainland China to complete all necessary procedures.</P>
      <P>According to Phillip, mainland China made important concessions
in intellectual property rights protection and service market opening
and transparency during the working party's 14th meeting, which
wrapped up Dec. 8.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, he went on, the mainland still failed to reach
agreement with major WTO members on many sensitive issues, including
farm produce subsidies, service trade and anti-dumping measures.</P>
      <P>According to WTO working procedures, entry will take one or two
more months even after mainland China completes its multilateral
talks with major WTO contracting parties. As a result, the two sides
of the Taiwan Strait are not expected to obtain WTO memberships by
the end of March next year.</P>
      <P>With Republican candidate George W. Bush's victory in the U.S.
presidential election, the U.S. trade representative will have a
brand new negotiating team after the Jan. 20 presidential
inauguration to handle Taipei- and Beijing-related trade affairs.</P>
      <P>Taipei applied to join the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
(GATT) in 1990, while mainland China filed its application with GATT
in 1986. The GATT was superseded by the WTO in 1995.</P>

Lien Chan, who is in Rome on a private trip, cabled his
congratulations to U.S. President-elect George W. Bush on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Bush will be sworn into office on Jan. 20, 2001, becoming the

most fiercely competitive race since the United States of America was
founded 224 years ago. Despite the election's outcome being undecided
over the past five weeks, the result was decided by trusting and
respecting the spirit of the U.S. Constitution, Lien said.</P>
      <P>He said he believes that this constitutional spirit played a key
role in maintaining U.S. national stability during the political
uncertainty of recent weeks. "By upholding the Constitution,
difficult issues can be easily resolved," Lien said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FINANCE MINISTER UPBEAT ON FINANCIAL REFORM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  14  (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Finance Minister Yen Ching-chang said
Thursday that he believes 2001 will be a year of "thorough changes"
for the country's financial sector because there will be a legal
environment conducive to financial reforms.</P>
      <P>Yen said at an informal meeting with a legislative subgroup that
the domestic asset management company (AMC) he hopes to introduce
into the industry to buy and sell problem loans is already moving
from the drawing board to its preliminary formative stages.</P>
      <P>He went on to say that a government asset management agency
similar to the U.S. Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC), which from
1989 to 1996 administered federal savings and loan institutions that
were insolvent between 1989 and 1992 by either bailing them out or
merging them, is also in the works.</P>
      <P>Following the passage of a bank merger law, Yen said that a
financial holding company law will also be sent to the Legislative
Yuan during its next session for deliberation.</P>
      <P>He reiterated that Taiwan is not in danger of a financial crisis,
adding that the 12 major banks with government share backing lend out
over 70 percent of the loans in the market, and saying that the
problematic farmers credit cooperatives account for only 1 percent of
the loans extended.</P>
      <P>However, he said that consolidation must take place because the
three largest banks in Taiwan account for only 24 percent of the
market, whereas elsewhere in the world, the three largest banks in a
country usually account for between 40 percent and 80 percent. He
added that the mergers will not be restricted to small banks, but
will also involve the 12 largest banks.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has 53 banks and nearly 360 non-bank financial
institutions such as farmers credit cooperatives.</P>
      <P>Paul Chiu, who had previously proposed setting up an RTC when he
was finance minister under the previous Kuomintang administration,
said at the same meeting that the Central Deposit Insurance
Corporation, which insures bank deposits, can raise its interest rate
to bring in an additional NT$3 billion (US $91 million) in premiums
that can be used in turn to raise NT$30 billion (US$907 million) in
government bonds to serve as capital for the formation of an RTC.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's financial health has been under criticism since The
Economist magazine recently published a report that said Taiwan may
suffer its own belated version of the Asian crisis -- perhaps even
before the Chinese New Year in January. The New York Times and
BusinessWeek magazine followed with similar reports that quoted
foreign analysts as saying Taiwan's actual rate of non-performing
loans is higher than the government admits.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN'S SOVEREIGN RATING REMAINS STABLE AT AA3: MOODY'S</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New York, Dec. 13 (CNA)
(By Jennifer Huang and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A senior executive with Moody's Investors
Service said Wednesday that the credit rating agency still ranks
Taiwan's sovereign rating as "stable" at AA3.</P>
      <P>Moody's Vice Chairman Thomas Byrne made the remarks in an
interview with CNA after delivering a speech on mainland China's
sovereign rating and investment risks. The lecture was sponsored by
the China Institute, a private think tank.</P>
      <P>Byrne said that although many Taiwan banks have been troubled by
a high non-performing debt rate, it will not affect the island's AA3
sovereign rating.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, he pointed out that political instability could
become a potential threat to Taiwan's sovereign risk rating.</P>
      <P>In his view, Byrne continued, continued squabbles between the
Democratic Progressive Party-led government and the
opposition-dominated legislature, coupled with slow progress in
parliamentary screening of the government's budget plan for the new
fiscal year, will undermine Taiwan investor confidence.</P>
      <P>Equally noteworthy is that inbound investment in Taiwan is
declining due to foreign businessmen's misgivings about the island's
political prospects, Byrne noted.</P>
      <P>Two Moody's banking industry analysts are currently in Taiwan to
study its banks' credit status and are expected to unveil their
latest credit rating report after wrapping up their visit and
returning to the United States next week.</P>
      <P>Among Asia-Pacific countries, Byrne said, Singapore boasts the
healthiest banking system, followed by Australia, Hong Kong and
Taiwan, in that order. Mainland China ranks eighth, lagging behind
even Malaysia and the Philippines.</P>
      <P>According to the latest Moody's assessment, Taiwan receives a
stable "AA3" rating in terms of its foreign exchange reserves and
high bank deposits.</P>
      <P>But the report also cited several elements that might affect
Taiwan's sovereign rating in the future. First of all, political
tension between to the two sides of the Taiwan Strait has not shown
signs of easing. Moreover, mainland China's insistence on the "one
China" policy and its refusal to renounce the use of force against
Taiwan might eventually affect the already close cross-strait trade
ties and even destabilize the Taiwan economy.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's financial authorities have said non-performing debts
account for about 6 percent of total bank loans, but Moody's said the
actual rate might be higher. Some U.S. securities firms have
estimated that Taiwan banks' non-performing debt rate is as high as
15 percent.</P>
      <P>Byrne said that although the increase in non-performing loans
could affect the health of the overall banking system, its impact on
a country's sovereign rating is limited. Nor will a high bad debt
rate cause an immediate threat to the downgrading of a country's
sovereign rating, he added.</P>
      <P>The Moody's assessment report also said Taiwan's long-term
economic performance has qualified the island to join the ranks of
"middle per capita income" countries in terms of standards set by the
Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.</P>
      <P>The report further said Taiwan banks should merge and enhance
transparency to survive ever-increasing competition, as a banking
glut has led to cut-throat competition and has threatened the
stability of Taiwan's banking sector.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Moody's ranks both Taiwan's and mainland China's
sovereign rating prospects as "stable." But Taiwan outshines mainland
China in terms of its long-term bank deposits, state bonds and
long-term government performance.</P>
      <P>Singapore led the 14 Asia-Pacific economies in the Moody's
sovereign rating report, followed by Japan, Taiwan, mainland China
and Hong Kong, in that order.</P>

      <P>Senior government officials from various
ministries convened their first meeting Thursday on the re-evaluation
of government policies regarding investment in mainland China.</P>
      <P>The cross-ministerial meeting was presided over by Mainland
Affairs Council (MAC) Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen and attended by
Economics Minister Lin Hsin-yi, Central Bank of China Governor Perng
Fai-nan, Council for Economic Planning and Development Chairman Chen
Po-chih, Council of Labor Affairs Vice Chairman Kuo Chih-jen and
Council of Agriculture Vice Chairman Lee Chien-chuan.</P>
      <P>A special task force headed by Vice Economics Minister Chen
Ruey-lung to re-evaluate the former Kuomintang administration's "no
haste, be patient" mainland investment policy submitted a report and
suggestions, which the officials discussed before reaching a
six-point consensus.</P>
      <P>The participants at the meeting agreed that:</P>
      <P>-- All new local investment projects in the mainland should
follow the concepts of "keeping the roots in Taiwan" and "risk
management;"</P>
      <P>-- the projects should not be detrimental to the employment
opportunities of Taiwan laborers;</P>
      <P>-- corporate sector needs and globalization must be taken into
account;</P>
      <P>-- an improved service system for Taiwan businessmen and
industries in mainland China should be established;</P>
      <P>-- the capital to be invested in mainland China should come from
"various sources;" and</P>
      <P>-- an "active adjustment" mechanism should be established for all
investment projects in mainland China.</P>
      <P>MAC Vice Chairman Teng Cheng-chung said after the meeting that
the current US$50 million maximum on individual investment projects
in mainland China still exists, but that amounts over that limit may
in the future be allowed on a case-by-case basis depending on
"various factors."</P>
      <P>He added that the meeting did not decide on the task force's
suggestion that local petrochemicals, wafer fabrication and personal
computer manufacturing be allowed to invest in mainland China because
such a decision would depend on the Cabinet.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAINLAND CHINA SAID FORMING `MINI THREE LINKS' GROUP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 14 (CNA)
(By Bear Lee)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China, which has decried the "mini
three links" that Taiwan will soon launch between the two sides, has
actually established a task force to deal with the matter, Taiwan's
top mainland affairs official was quoted as saying Thursday.</P>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen was quoted
by Legislator Lai Shih-pao as saying at a closed-door legislative
meeting that the government is now "cautiously optimistic" about the
"mini three links" -- transportation, postal and trade -- between the
outlying islands of Kinmen and Matsu and designated mainland ports.</P>
      <P>Mainland China, which insists on the "one China" principle as the
basis for any cross-strait "three direct links," has on the face of
it been throwing cold water on the move which Taiwan is set to begin
at the beginning of next year.</P>
      <P>Tsai was invited to brief the first meeting of the Legislative
Yuan's cross-strait panel on the "mini three links" issue.</P>
      <P>Lawmaker Chen Ching-pao, who is elected from Kinmen, suggested
that a direct voyage between Kinmen and the mainland port of Xiamen
be allowed as early as Dec. 25 on a test basis.</P>
      <P>Tsai first said the move would violate regulations, but later
promised a decision on the issue will be available next Monday after
discussion with Premier Chen Chun-hsiung.</P>
      <P>She said that the government is willing "to do anything that is
beneficial to improved cross-strait ties," including allowing
proposed visits to the mainland by opposition lawmakers.</P>
      <P>Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng, who presided over the
meeting, said that whether the legislative panel will pay a scheduled
visit to the mainland has yet to be considered and approved by the
legislature.</P>
      <P>Tsai reportedly told the meeting that far from being against
"mini three links," the mainland side in fact has "great
expectations" of the links and has set up a group to handle related
affairs.</P>
      <P>Tsai was described by the meeting participants as "keeping a low
profile" over the issue. "What we care about most is to realize the
mini links. There is no need for us to show off," she is reported to
have said. She was also reported to have later changed her previous
remarks, amending the phrase "cautiously optimistic" on the links to
"cautious."</P>

    <HEADLINE>CONTROL YUAN TO REVIEW 45-YEAR-OLD MUTINY CASE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 14 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Control Yuan is to review a mutiny case
involving a well-known general 45 years ago after a scholar found a
report favorable to the general.</P>
      <P>Gen. Sun Li-jen was a famous general during the Sino-Japanese war
and commander-in-chief of the army from 1950-1954.</P>
      <P>In 1955, one of his former subordinates and confidants, Kuo
Ting-liang, was arrested for plotting a mutiny on the eve of a
military inspection by then-President Chiang Kai-shek.</P>
      <P>A total of 34 military officers, all of them Sun's former
subordinates, were implicated in the plot by Kuo and sentenced to
various jail terms.</P>
      <P>Sun was sacked from his post as personal chief of staff to the
president in 1955 and remained under house arrest in Taichung until
1988.</P>
      <P>He died in 1990 at the age of 92, and his son Sun An-ping has
long sought his name to be cleared after the 1988 death of President
Chiang Kai-shek's son Chiang Chiang Ching-kuo, who succeeded his
father as president of the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>In a plea to the Control Yuan Thursday, Sun called for the
disclosure of the full text of a 1955 report by the Control Yuan's
five-member panel, and the related letters of the panel members to
Chiang.</P>
      <P>The report claimed that Sun was "framed," contradicting a
government investigation by a nine-member panel chaired by then-Vice
President Chen Cheng, said Chu Hung-yuan, a researcher at the
Institute of Modern History under Academia Sinica, who was asked by
the Control Yuan to look into the case.</P>
      <P>The five Control Yuan members concluded in their report that Sun
could not have intended to mutiny in light of his intelligence and a
confession by alleged Beijing spy Kuo.</P>
      <P>Letters written separately by the panel members to Chiang pointed
out unanimously that there was no evidence Sun had any knowledge of
his former subordinate's plot, according to Chu.</P>
      <P>What is more, Chu said, Kuo's fatal fall from a moving train in
1991 is also dubious.</P>
      <P>Kuo was initially sentenced to death, later commuted to life
imprisonment. He was released on parole in 1975 and had tried to
clear his name by persistently filing pleas with various law
enforcing authorities.</P>
      <P>He was found dead on Nov. 16, 1991, apparently having fallen from
a moving train. However, Chu said a post-mortem conducted by six
surgeons from National Taiwan University Hospital showed that there
were four to five injuries to his head which suggested that he was
murdered.</P>
      <P>Calling for a new probe into Kuo's death, Chu said that the
Political Warfare Department under the Ministry of National Defense,
the Military Intelligence Bureau and the former Taiwan Garrison
Command, which were charged with catching spies when the island was
ruled by martial law, should explain if they played any role in Kuo's
death.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC GOVERNMENT SPOKESMAN VISITS JAPAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Tokyo,  Dec.  14  (CNA)
(By Mike Chang and Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Government Information
Office Director Su Cheng-ping said here Thursday that Texas Gov.
George W. Bush's victory in the U.S. presidential election will not
bring about big changes in U.S. policy toward Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Su, who arrived in Japan the day before for a week-long visit,
told foreign journalists at an informal gathering at Tokyo's Foreign
Correspondents Club that American policy toward Taiwan has a sense of
continuity and that the United States believes in the peaceful
resolution of cross-Taiwan Strait issues. He added that this is line
with both ROC and U.S. interests.</P>
      <P>Touching on Taiwan's domestic political situation, Su, who also
serves as ROC government spokesman, said that ROC President Chen
Shui-bian's Democratic Progressive Party administration is a minority
government. Therefore, he went on, the new administration might face
some difficulties in promoting certain policies, but Chen will soon
gain the experience needed to overcome these difficulties.</P>
      <P>Su pointed out that the Republic of China is a completely
democratic country, and that the resolution of all cross-strait
issues requires the consensus of the people. Taiwan looks forward to
dialogue with mainland China, he continued, but mainland China has so
far been unwilling to re-engage in dialogue, citing as the reason
Taiwan's unwillingness to first accept Beijing's "one China"
principle.</P>
      <P>Su said that Taiwan does not rule out discussions on the "one
China" issue, including its content and definition. However, he added
that Beijing's "one China" -- the People's Republic of China -- is
not acceptable to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Regarding foreign media reports on Taiwan being on the brink of a
financial crisis, Su denied the charges and said that although Taiwan
may be facing "certain problems" with its financial system, the
fundamentals are sound and the government has already taken measures
to respond to the issues. He added that the effects that may be
caused by the problems are limited and will not bring about a
so-called financial crisis.</P>
      <P>Su also said that the "one country, two systems" method being
used to govern Hong Kong is not acceptable to the people of Taiwan.
Hong Kong was a colony, unlike Taiwan, he said, adding that the two
cannot be compared.</P>
      <P>On the issue of the controversial fourth nuclear power plant
project that was scrapped by the Chen's government, Su said the issue
involves political and economic factors and that the outcome will
depend on a decision by Taiwan's Grand Justices. He added that it is
incorrect to say that Taiwan will run short of electricity if the
plant is not built.</P>
      <P>Su also claimed that 70 percent of the Taiwan public are against
the opposition alliance's intention to recall the president, which
came about in the wake of the announcement of the scrapping of the
nuclear plant. He added that he is confident the recall issue will be
overcome.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING UNDERTAKING "POLICY OF DISTRACTION": THINK TANK</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,   Dec.  14  (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>To delay or avoid a potential
confrontation with the United States, Communist China is undertaking
a "policy of distraction," actively seeking to drive a wedge between
Washington and its Asian allies, a Texas-based private think tank
wrote in a recent analysis.</P>
      <P>Stratfor, Inc., pointed out in its Dec. 13 Global Intelligence
Update that Communist Chinese Premier Li Peng recently told
opposition Japanese politicians in Beijing that Japan must have its
own voice in politics and on security issues, adding that Peng also
said Japanese forces are sufficient to defend Japan and U.S. forces
stationed there are nothing but "a symbol of U.S. hegemony."</P>
      <P>Li's comments are part of "an emerging Chinese policy of
distraction aimed at the United States," noted the analysis. Beijing
is increasingly concerned that its own interests and those of
Washington will inevitably clash but is not prepared to confront the
United States right now, it noted.</P>
      <P>Instead, Stratfor said, Beijing "is seeking ways to undermine the
close coordination between Washington and its Asian allies,
particularly South Korea and Japan."</P>

      <P>South Africa is set to host the

the two continents together to set up partnerships and achieve trade
deals, in July of next year.</P>
      <P>United Nations Development Program Representative John Ohiohenuan

together in order to foster economic growth in sub-Saharan Africa
through technology transfers, joint ventures, and financial
investments.</P>
      <P>Ohiohenuan said the forum will focus primarily on building links
through Asian direct investment in Africa, adding that one of the
major challenges will be the fact that Asian companies are generally
more interested in establishing trade links.</P>
      <P>The first Africa-Asia business forum was held in Malaysia in
October, 1999 and brought together 230 companies from the two
continents.</P>
      <P>Asian companies set to participate in the forum include those

    <HEADLINE>SHOES TO BE AUCTIONED OFF TO RAISE FUNDS FOR CAMBODIAN ORPHANS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  14  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A total of 5,000 pairs of shoes will be
auctioned off this weekend at a charity bazaar in downtown Taipei to
raise funds for orphans and homeless children in Cambodia.</P>
      <P>The charity bazaar, scheduled to be held at No. 34, Lane 198,
Siwei Road between Dec. 17 and Jan. 20, will also have jewelry,
Chinese paintings and calligraphy works, T-shirts, cards, CDs, and
books on sale, all for the purpose of raising more money for poor
children in remote rural areas in Cambodia who lead deprived lives
with little chance for an education.</P>
      <P>According to Yang Wei-lin, founder and head of the charity Field
Relief Agency, which has been working for years to help homeless
children in deserted border areas in Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, and
Vietnam, bazaar goers will also be able see pictures and videotapes
depicting the hardships that these children face.</P>
      <P>Also during the bazaar, people will be briefed on an education
plan currently being implemented in a mountainous region of Cambodia
under the supervision of the Field Relief Agency and also on a women
and children rescue plan soon to be initiated in the remote
Cambodian-Laos border region, said Yang.</P>
      <P>Yang, formerly a flight attendant, said helping these unfortunate
children requires manpower and materials, adding that while relief
efforts can easily die with a suspension in contributions, her care
and compassion for these poor children has never diminished.</P>
      <P>Yang said she hopes that, through the bazaar, the well-off
citizens of Taiwan will gain a better understanding of the poverty
and hopelessness that innocent people in that part of the world face,
some of whom are of Chinese origin, and will offer some tiny part of
their possessions to the needy.</P>
      <P>She retold the heart-rending story of seeing a little girl
begging in a market in a border village years ago. The fatherless
child, whose mother had also just died, was carrying her six-day old
baby brother in a swaddling cloth on her chest. The infant was too
weak to cry out in hunger and only lay there with its mouth open and
eyes closed.</P>
      <P>Yang said that after the little girl left after receiving some
money for food, the image of the infant's wide-open mouth and dying
face lingered in her mind for a long time.</P>
      <P>She thought to herself that money alone won't help these poor
souls. "What they need is education," Yang concluded. From that day,
she decided to work to help people in these poor areas gain an
education and a better chance in life. So she established the Field
Relief Agency and began looking for volunteers and donations.</P>
      <P>In four years, Yang has helped establish 15 make-shift schools in
mountainous areas of Cambodia, has sponsored some 700 children, and
has managed to recruit 27 volunteer teachers from Taiwan to teach in
those schools.</P>
      <P>At Kuang Hua School in Yunshai Village, where 95 percent of the
villagers are Hakka people or their descendants, Yang accepted 67
children who had never attended school for even a single day.</P>
      <P>The children who attend the schools established by Yang divide
their time equally between studying and making a living by farming or
making pottery.</P>
      <P>Yang also mentioned the touching story of the children at the
school offering all the cash they could and asking Yang to send it to
Taiwan to help the victims of the deadly earthquake that struck the
island on Sept. 21, 1999.</P>
      <P>Yang said she could not turn down the compassionate gesture and
accepted the money, in tattered and stained small-denomination
Cambodian and U.S. bills, valued at about US$75, from the poor and
struggling families who sometimes go a whole day without a meal.</P>
      <P>After returning to Taiwan, she said, she and her aids tried to
change the cash into New Taiwan dollars at the Bank of Taiwan. The
bank clerks said the bills were too old and worn and refused to
accept them.</P>
      <P>Yang then packed the money into a bag and sent it to the county
government of Nantou, one of the hardest-hit areas in central Taiwan,
with a note on the bag saying "Love from Cambodia. Value: about
US$75."</P>
      <P>Although only a tiny fraction of the amount of money that poured
into Taiwan from around the world after the devastating earthquake
struck, the US$75 from the Cambodian village was one of the most
touching contributions that Taiwan has ever received, Yang asserted.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FOREIGN MINISTER STRESSES CORDIAL TIES WITH PALAU</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  15  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Foreign Minister Tien Hung-mao Friday
denied speculation that the Republic of China's diplomatic relations
with its West Pacific ally of Palau may be shaky, stressing that
relations between the two countries have been cordial.</P>
      <P>"We have consistently enjoyed a warm relationship with Palau, and
speculation about a possible 'about-face' in the Pacific island
nation's foreign policy is unfounded," Tien noted.</P>
      <P>The minister was responding to opposition New Party Legislator
Elmer Feng's claim that Palau President-elect Tommy E. Remengesau is
scheduled to arrive in Taiwan Saturday to express his country's
dissatisfaction with the ROC's attitude toward Palau.</P>
      <P>Feng said at a Legislative Yuan plenary session that as the ROC
bet on a "wrong choice" in Palau's Nov. 8 presidential
election, Remengesau will voice a protest during his visit.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Feng said, the Palau president-elect will also his
country's displeasure with the ROC's failure to open an embassy on
its territory since the two countries forged diplomatic ties late
last year.</P>
      <P>Because of all these factors, Feng cautioned the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs (MOFA) that Palau is likely to switch its diplomatic
recognition from Taipei to Beijing. According to Feng, Remengesau may
travel to Beijing via Hong Kong after his Taipei visit.</P>
      <P>Commenting on Feng's remarks, Tien said Feng might have been
misinformed about the purposes of Remengesau's upcoming visit.</P>
      <P>Tien said Remengesau is now Palau's vice president who has had
outgoing Palau President Kuniwo Nakamura's full support to be his
successor.</P>
      <P>Noting that Remengesau is no stranger to Taiwan, Tien said,
ROC-Palau relations are in good shape and Remengesau's visit has
nothing to do with any possible diplomatic "about-face."</P>
      <P>Tien would not elaborate on Remengesau's itinerary or agenda
here as Remengesau has informed the MOFA of his desire to keep his
Taipei visit low profile.</P>
      <P>Tien went on to say that he will arrange for Remengesau to meet
with ROC lawmakers to brief them on the current state of ROC-Palau
relations.</P>
      <P>Emphasizing that ROC-Palau relations have been close, Tien
said the ROC is scheduled to open its embassy in Palau in January
2001 to facilitate bilateral exchanges and further boost
mutual cooperation.</P>
      <P>Tien also took advantage of his meeting with Feng on Friday
to urge the opposition-dominated legislature to recover a MOFA
budget plan for offering a US$30 million loan to Palau to help
finance its economic development projects. At a budget screening
meeting last week, lawmakers deleted the lending proposal from the
government's budgetary plan for the new fiscal year, which begins
Jan. 1, 2001.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT SUPPORTS PROPOSED LEGISLATIVE YUAN PRESIDENT'S VISIT TO BEIJING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 15 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The major opposition Kuomintang supports a
proposed visit to Beijing by a high-profile delegation to be led by
Legislative Yuan President and KMT Vice Chairman Wang Jin-pyng, a KMT
official said Friday.</P>
      <P>KMT Secretary-General Lin Feng-cheng said the party fully
supports Wang's Beijing visit, which will hopefully take place soon
after the Lunar New Year.</P>
      <P>Describing Wang as one of the most appropriate choices for the
mission, Lin at the same time said he hopes that Beijing will
demonstrate an equal degree of enthusiasm and hospitality to Wang and
the Legislative Yuan delegation.</P>
      <P>Wang's proposed Beijing trip is widely seen as an effective way
of redressing the new deadlock between Beijing and Taipei since
President Chen Shui-bian took office in May this year, and also as a
key to helping resume talks between chairman of Taipei's Straits
Exchange Foundation and the head of the Beijing-based Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>It was learned that Wang had previously not been too enthusiastic
about the Beijing trip, only recently changing his attitude after
learning that Beijing had demonstrated a plausible degree of sincere
enthusiasm for the plan amidst evident support from the Chen
administration.</P>
      <P>Still somewhat hesitant about the proposed visit, Wang stressed
that the Beijing trip, if it indeed occurs, will have to be based on
four principles: national needs, popular support, legislative
resolution, and equality and dignity.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC  SEMICONDUCTOR  FIRM  TO ESTABLISH FOUNDRY IN SINGAPORE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  Dec.  15 (CNA)
(By Sherman Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's United Microelectronics (UMC)
announced plans Friday to establish the world's most advanced 300-mm
wafer foundry company in Singapore's Pasir Ris Wafer Fab Park.</P>
      <P>UMC and German firm Infineon Technologies AG signed a memorandum
of understanding under which the German company will take a minority
stake in the company that will operate as a subsidiary of UMC with a
planned investment of US$3.6 billion.</P>
      <P>The 300-mm plant will be built in two phases, with a total
planned production capacity of 40,000 wafers per month. The company
will focus on System-on-Chip (SOC) products utilizing advanced
World-logic 0.13-um and 0.10 10-um copper/low k process technologies
jointly developed by UMC, Infineon and IBM. Groundbreaking for the
plant is scheduled for early 2001 with equipment move-in for the
first phase scheduled for mid-2002.</P>
      <P>UMC and Infineon are both pioneers in the implementation of
300-mm wafer production. Infineon was the first company to ship
products from a 300-mm facility, and UMC's joint venture with
Hitachi and Trecenti Technologies, was the first pure-play foundry
to achieve working silicon for 300-mm wafers, and operates the
world's first 300-mm production plant to manufacture functional ICs.</P>
      <P>The decision to locate the joint venture in Singapore
demonstrates the growing importance of the country as a center for
high value-added manufacturing. Singapore is home to numerous
advanced wafer foundries and test and assembly facilities. This is
the first announcement for a state-of-the-art 300-mm fab on the
island and represents the largest investment in the history of its
semiconductor industry.</P>
      <P>UMC, a world leader in semiconductors, operates seven wafer
foundries in Taiwan's Hsinchu Science-Based Industrial Park.</P>
      <P>Infineon Technologies AG offers semiconductor and system
solutions for applications in the wired and wireless communications
markets, for security systems and smart cards, for the automotive and
industrial sectors, as well as memory products.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PILOTS ABSENT FROM FLIGHT SIMULATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  15 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The three pilots involved in the crash of
Singapore Airlines (SIA) flight SQ006 did not show up at a flight
simulation Thursday designed to help determine the cause of the
accident, sources from the Taoyuan District Prosecutor's Office said
Friday.</P>
      <P>Soong Kuo-yeh, assistant chief prosecutor at the Taoyuan District
Prosecutor's Office, said that the office decided to add a
requirement that SIA should also be responsible for the return of the
three pilots to Taipei when they are needed for the crash
investigation.</P>
      <P>The crash killed 83 of the 179 people aboard the jumbo jet that
took off at Chiang Kai-shek International Airport in stormy weather
on the evening of Oct. 31.</P>
      <P>The Taoyuan office bowed to international pressure last week and
agreed to allow the three pilots to leave Taiwan on condition that
the Singapore representative office in Taiwan is obliged to make sure
the pilots return to Taipei when they are needed for the
investigation.</P>
      <P>The pilots -- flight commander Capt. Foong Chee Kong, 41, a
Malaysian, and Singaporean co-pilots Latif Cyrano, 36, and Ng Kheng
Leng, 38 -- had been prevented from leaving the island by the Taoyuan
Prosecutor's Office since the day of the crash. Pilots from some
foreign airlines threatened to boycott Taiwan airports unless the
three pilots were treated according to international precedent.</P>
      <P>The new requirements were expected to take another three to four
days because additional paperwork is needed. The prosecutors said
related papers should be signed by SIA officials of president or
general manager levels or higher to enable the pilots to go home.</P>
      <P>Soong declined to say whether the prosecutors' decision to impose
additional conditions was related to the pilots' absence from the
flight simulation sponsored by SIA on Thursday.</P>
      <P>At the request of prosecutors, SIA arranged for a cargo plane
similar to the ill-fated Boeing 747 passenger plane that crashed to
conduct a simulated flight to retrace the path of SQ006.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors hoped to gain better understanding of the crash via
the simulation in order to determine whether the accident was caused
by pilot error, misleading control tower instructions, bad weather or
other reasons.</P>
      <P>They said they will decide whether the three SIA pilots will be
prosecuted for the crash after the investigation into the accident is
complete.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC-JAPANESE JOINT-VENTURE SYNCHROTRON BEAM LINE INAUGURATED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Tokyo,  Dec.  15  (CNA)
(By S.J. Tsai and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A high-energy synchrotron radiation beam
line jointly created by the Republic of China and Japan was
inaugurated in Hyogo Prefecture Friday to facilitate cutting-edge
life science and material research.</P>
      <P>The new beam line, believed to be the world's strongest and most
powerful synchrotron radiation light source, was co-produced by the
ROC's Synchrotron Radiation Research Center (SRRC) and the Spring-8
Light Source under the Japan Synchrotron Radiation Research Institute
(JSRRI).</P>
      <P>The facility also marks the first time that the ROC has managed
to break mainland China's diplomatic embargo to forge a joint venture
with Japan in the high-technology field.</P>
      <P>ROC National Science Council Chairman Weng Cheng-i, SRRC Director
Chen Chien-teh, JSRRI Chairman Yashinori Ihara and Spring-8 Director
Hiromichi Kamitsubo jointly presided over the inauguration of the
research facility.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the occasion, Chen said the new beam line will allow
ROC scientists to perform exclusive research in biological structure
and state-of-the-art material science from next year.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, many Taiwan research teams are planning to
travel to Hyogo to use the new synchrotron radiation beam line for
experiments in environmental engineering and earth science, as well
as research into protein crystalgraphy, high-temperature
superconductivity and cutting-edge materials such as magnetic and
optical materials.</P>
      <P>Chen said the inauguration of the new facility is expected to
lead Taiwan into brand new research frontiers in life science and
cutting-edge materials development.</P>
      <P>Taiwan installed a synchrotron radiation accelerator in October
1993. It can produce third-generation beam line for soft
X-ray-related scientific research. The accelerator, however, cannot
provide beam line for hard X-ray-related scientific experiments.</P>
      <P>The ROC then proposed at the 1996 ministerial-level meeting of
the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum that all APEC member
economies open their synchrotron radiation research facilities for
joint research.</P>
      <P>The JSRRI's Spring-8 Light Source, inaugurated in October 1997,
can produce the world's strongest hard X-rays for research purposes.
As Taiwan's SRRC has reached world standards in cutting-edge
scientific research, Spring-8 agreed in late 1998 to cooperate with
it in building a beam line for biological structure and material
science research. The cooperative program also made the SRRC the
first foreign research institute to host an exclusive facility at
Spring-8.</P>
      <P>In addition to cooperation in research hardware construction,
Chen said the SRRC will also cooperate with the Japanese research
institute in various scientific studies, including protein
crystalgraphy, structural biology, cutting-edge materials and
non-condensed physics.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN, JAPAN YOUNG LAWMAKERS TO FORM EXCHANGE ORGANIZATIONS</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Two groups of young lawmakers from Taiwan
and Japan have tentatively agreed to form parliamentary organizations
to strengthen exchanges between the younger parliamentarians of the
two countries, it was announced here Friday.</P>
      <P>A group of four legislators from Taiwan led by Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) Legislator Lin Chung-mo met with a group of
members of Japan's Lower House led by Koki Kobayashi Thursday at the
Headquarters of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) to discuss how to
strengthen exchanges and friendship between the younger
parliamentarians of the two countries.</P>
      <P>Kobayashi said at a press conference jointly sponsored by
Kobayashi and Lin at LDP headquarters that the Japanese side will be
temporarily named the "Japan-Taiwan Younger Parliamentarians
Association." Taiwan has already organized a supra partisan
"Taiwan-Japan Parliamentarians Anti-Hegemonic Alliance."</P>
      <P>Lin said that the alliance under his leadership comprises 22
members in the Legislative Yuan and is aimed at promoting exchanges
between the younger parliamentarians of the two countries.</P>
      <P>However, he went on, because the Japanese side expressed a
negative opinion about the word "anti-hegemonic" at the meeting, his
alliance may consider changing the name.</P>
      <P>Both Lin and Kobayashi said that the new parliamentary
organization will not become an obstacle for the "Japan-ROC Dietmen
Council," which was established to promote unofficial relations
between Taiwan and Japan.</P>
      <P>Lin also expressed the hope that Republic of China former
President Lee Teng-hui can visit Japan soon, and said that Japan
should follow the U.S. example by passing legislation similar to the
Taiwan Relations Act. Japan should also play a more positive role in
helping maintain the security in the Taiwan Strait, he said.</P>
      <P>Other members of the ROC delegation included Parris Chang (DPP),
Legislator Hsu Jung-su (DPP) and Legislator Chen Chen-hsiung of the
main opposition Kuomintang. They arrived in Tokyo Thursday.</P>
      <P>They left for home Friday after calling on Japanese civic leaders
including Speaker of the House of Representatives Tamisuke Wataneki.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Dec.   15  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of scholars attending an
international seminar in Taipei agreed Friday that Taiwan's security
is closely related to regional developments and that its survival
lies in security, democracy and economy.</P>
      <P>The one-day seminar, organized by the Taiwan Research
Institute, a private think tank headed by former Republic of China
President Lee Teng-hui, focused discussion on Taiwan security in the
year 2000.</P>
      <P>Michael Y.M. Kau, a senior advisor of the ROC's National Security
Council and a political science professor at U.S. Brown University,
said Taiwan should not be isolated in the international community in
view of its marvelous achievements in economic development and
political democratization.</P>
      <P>Torkel Patterson, a senior researcher with the U.S. Center for
Strategic and International Studies, said the United States wants to
continue constructive engagements with mainland China and would not
have any conflicts with its.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, Patterson said, the United States also fully
respects Taiwan people's choice of democratic lifestyle and values.
Moreover, he said, the United States hopes to see Taiwan
enjoy a continued economic boom because of Taiwan's crucial strategic
location, close bilateral trade ties and Taiwan's clout to
Asia-Pacific regional development.</P>
      <P>Lin Cheng-yi, director of Academia Sinica's Institute of
European and American Studies, said Taiwan's security environment
sees significant changes in 2000 which reflect in a sharp increase
in the number of papers discussing the possibilities of
military conflicts erupting between the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait.</P>
      <P>Lin said either side can unilaterally adopt goodwill measures
and then ask the other side to make reciprocal response in order
to gradually reduce cross-strait tension.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that the United States can play a more active
role in cross-strait confidence-building process. "The United States
can act as a balancer, guarantor and supervisor, and it should
remain impartial and ask both Taipei and Beijing to compromise on
their disputes," he explained.</P>
      <P>Kenneth Boutin, a research fellow with Singapore's Nanyang
Technological University, said in the eyes of policymakers of
Southeast Asian countries, Taiwan's importance lies in its role in
regional economic development as Taiwan has provided the
region with financial and technological assistance.</P>
      <P>In the political arena, Boutin said, Taiwan's status in Southeast
Asia has been affected by mainland China's role in the region. For
Southeast Asian countries, Boutin said, they can neither ignore
mainland China's political clout nor Taiwan's economic strength.
Therefore, he said, promoting improvements in Taiwan-mainland China
ties is in the common interest of Southeast Asian countries.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Hidenori Ijiri, a professor with Tokyo University of
Foreign Studies, said Japan attaches great importance to maintain
peace in the Taiwan Strait and that peaceful solution to
cross-strait disputes has been a major field of Japan's preventive
diplomacy.</P>
      <P>Ijiri further said Japanese scholars and politicians have begun
to use new thinking to deal with the Taiwan Strait issue. In the
past, he said, the Japanese tended to mull cross-strait disputes
from either "pro-Taiwan" or "pro-China" viewpoints. Nowadays, he
said, the Japanese have begun to separate Taiwan-Japan
engagements from Japan-(mainland) China relations.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAC PITCHES FOR BEIJING'S POSITIVE INTERACTION TO EXPAND 'MINI LINKS'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  15  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China looks forward to
seeing mainland China adopt positive measures in connection with its
planned opening of direct "mini three links" across the narrow Taiwan
Strait, a senior mainland affairs official said Friday.</P>
      <P>Lin Chong-pin, vice chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC) told a news conference that the planned direct trade, mail and
shipping links between the ROC's frontline islands of Kinmen/Matsu
and mainland China's Xiamen/Mawei, commonly known as "mini three
links," can be expanded only when mainland China is willing to adopt
complementary measures.</P>
      <P>According to the MAC-drafted plan, Taiwan will unilaterally
implement its direct "mini three links" opening measures from the
beginning of next year.</P>
      <P>As mainland China still refuses to resume dialogue with Taiwan,
Lin said, the enforcement will initially focus on "legalizing"
small-amount trade between fishermen on both sides of the Taiwan
Strait that has been going on illegally for years.</P>
      <P>"The enforcement will also include measures that we can
unilaterally implemented," Lin explained, adding that mainland
China's positive interaction is needed to expand the scope of "mini
three links."</P>
      <P>Asked about the possible currency exchange issues following the
opening of "mini three links," Lin said in the initial stage, only
the ROC's currency -- the New Taiwan dollar -- can be used in the
ROC territory.</P>
      <P>In the Kinmen-Matsu area, Lin said, traders can convert their
foreign currencies into the New Taiwan dollar. But he stressed that
the foreign currencies mainly refer to the U.S. dollar.</P>
      <P>In the later stage, Lin said, the ROC government will consider
allowing the circulation of the mainland currency -- renminbi -- in
the Kinmen-Matsu area under two premises -- mainland China is
willing to accept the New Taiwan dollar and the sides develop a
currency settlement mechanism. "No timetable is set for the
beginning of this measure," he added.</P>
      <P>As for the government's plan to ease its "no haste, be patient"
policy on mainland China-bound investment, Lin said the relaxed
policy will offer local entrepreneurs greater freedom in deciding
the items they want to invest on the mainland while highlighting the
spirit of "keeping their business roots" in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lin said the ROC hopes that the new U.S. government
under President-elect George W. Bush will play a more active role in
balancing and stabilizing relations across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Lin said he believes that the United States can help bridge
cross-strait negotiations while refraining from involvement in
substantive talks.</P>
      <P>Lin further said he does not expect that the incoming Bush
administration would make any fundamental changes to the current U.S.
policy on cross-Taiwan Strait issues.</P>
      <P>Noting that the ROC and the United States have common interest
in upholding democracy, human rights and economic prosperity as well
as maintaining Asia-Pacific regional peace and stability, Lin said
the ROC hopes to further strengthen cooperation with the new U.S.
administration.

    <HEADLINE>DPP FOUNDING CHAIRMAN DIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 15 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Chiang Peng-chien, a member of the Control
Yuan and founding chairman of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP),
died Friday of pancreatic cancer at the age of 61.</P>
      <P>National Taiwan University Hospital said Chiang was diagnosed as
suffering from a pancreatic tumor last year. He maintained a stable
condition after chemotherapy, but a regular checkup in June this year
found that the tumor had relapsed.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said he was saddened to learn of
Chiang's death and lauded him as a selfless man who contributed
greatly to Taiwan's democratic development. He also eulogized
Chiang's "lifelong pursuit of his ideals."</P>
      <P>The president said that Chiang never sought the limelight, but
quietly pursued his ideals, making him a paradigm of the Taiwan
people.</P>
      <P>Ever since his early days as a lawyer, Chiang dedicated himself
to the promotion of human rights and was a member of the legal team
that also included now-Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian,
which acted as the defense during the 1979 Formosa Incident trial.</P>
      <P>He also campaigned on a "one-term legislator and lifelong
non-partisan people" slogan and won election as a legislator in 1983.
He honored his words by not seeking reelection three years later.</P>
      <P>But he was most credited for spearheading the formation of the
opposition DPP in 1986 and serving as its inaugural chairman. During
the grim atmosphere of the martial law era, he led the DPP through
its initial difficulties and great adversity.</P>
      <P>The Formosa Incident occurred on the night of Dec. 10, 1979, when
a group of opposition activists clashed with police during a
torchlight parade to observe International Human Rights Day. Sixteen
people were injured during the clash.</P>
      <P>Two days later, many of the people who took part in the parade
were arrested, tried by a military court and jailed. Among them were
Annette Lu, who became the nation's vice president this year, Chen
Chu, who is currently chairman of the Cabinet-level Council of Labor
Affairs and former DPP chairmen Lin Yi-hsiung and Shih Ming-teh.</P>
      <P>The incident, which took place in the Kuomintang-instigated
"white terror" atmosphere, is generally thought to have been a
turning point in Taiwan's political history and an event that
eventually led to the lifting of martial law, as well as the ending
of a ban on new political parties and newspapers.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's new-style NT$500 notes went into

      <P>The Central Bank of China (CBC) had intended to issue the new

    <HEADLINE>LAWYERS URGE VICE PRESIDENT, LOCAL MAGAZINE TO SET ASIDE DIFFERENCES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  15 (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan Bar Association Executive Director
Chu Sheng-chun Friday urged Republic of China Vice President Annette
Lu and local newsmagazine The Journalist to set aside their legal
differences "for the greater good of the nation."</P>
      <P>Chu and a group of attorneys held a news conference to announce
their common desire to see the dust settled so that the vice
president can concentrate on affairs of the state while the weekly
can focus on its duty to provide impartial news coverage.</P>
      <P>He urged Lu to be magnanimous and the magazine to respond with
good will so that the "workings of the country and society can get
back on track."</P>
      <P>Lu and The Journalist have been engrossed in a legal battle over
the magazine's Nov. 16 report that Lu "tried to finish off the
president" by calling the magazine with a story that President Chen
Shui-bian was having an affair with one of his young female staffers.
On Dec. 4, Lu's legal team demanded that the magazine openly
apologize by Dec. 10 over what it claimed to be "obviously false and
malicious" reporting on Lu.</P>
      <P>However, The Journalist claims to have proof that the voice on
the phone was Lu's, and only responded with a Dec. 8 letter that Lu's
legal team described as an attempt to "distort the definition of
press freedom" and "mislead the general public" without any kind of
reflection on the ethical code of professional journalists.</P>
      <P>Lu's six-member legal team and 13 legal advisers -- including her
elder brother Lu Chuan-sheng -- announced Thursday that she will file
a civil suit against the magazine, seeking NT$100 million (US$3
million) in compensation, and does not rule out the possibility of
pressing criminal charges.</P>
      <P>Chu said that he had already tried to persuade Lu's brother not
to press the case. However, he added that it appeared no single
"outsider" can control the events, which led him and others in the
legal profession to try to appeal to both sides openly as a group and
to serve as a moderating force if necessary.</P>
      <P>Chu declared on behalf of the other lawyers that they fully
respect the vice president's litigation rights but also respect
journalistic freedom.</P>
      <P>He went on to say that the lawyers understand that Lu is pursuing
legal action to protect her reputation and that The Journalist is
firmly holding its ground in an attempt to preserve the freedom of
the press.</P>
      <P>However, he said that political bickering in Taiwan has continued
non-stop, adding to the social unrest and economic woes. Out of a
"sense of responsibility," he added, the lawyers believe any action
that may lead to further social disorder should be avoided.</P>
      <P>Chu said that the lawyers are willing to be moderators and help
bring the whole affair to an end as quickly as possible while heeding
the principles of human rights and journalistic freedom.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Vice Foreign Minister
David Lee has met with the leaders of Macedonia's ruling alliance to
reaffirm bilateral ties during his four-day trip to the former
Yugoslavian republic. Lee's trip began on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>According to an ROC Foreign Ministry press release, Lee's visit
came in the wake of recent changes in the make up of Macedonia's
coalition government. Macedonia is one of two European diplomatic
allies of the Republic of China, with the other being the Holy See.</P>
      <P>According to the press release, Lee met with Macedonian Prime
Minister Ljubcho Georgievski of the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary
Organization (VMRO), Democratic Party of Albanians (DPA) leader Arben
Xaferi, and Risto Gusterov, head of the Liberal Party (LP) of
Macedonia, which has replaced the Democratic Alternative (DA) party
as the third member of the ruling coalition.</P>
      <P>Lee also called on Deputy Prime Minister Zoran Krstevski, Defense
Minister Ljuben Paunoski, Economics Minister Besnik Fetai, and
Parliament Speaker Stojan Andov. He later met with acting Foreign
Minister Viktor Gaber to exchange opinions on the progress of various
cooperative projects between Taiwan and Macedonia.</P>
      <P>The press release added that because Macedonian products are
scheduled to begin receiving tariff-free export benefits in the 22
countries of the European Union and the European Free Trade
Association on Jan. 1, 2001, the ROC-invested Skopje Export
Processing Zone will be a "perfect springboard" for Taiwan's
industries to dive into the European market.</P>
      <P>According to the Macedonian Information Agency (MIA), Lee said at
a press conference Thursday that cooperation between Macedonia and
Taiwan is "good" and that there is no reason to disrupt diplomatic
ties.</P>
      <P>Questioned on Macedonian President Boris Trajkovski's statement
that "only economic cooperation is possible between Macedonia and
Taiwan," Lee said that the remark had been "misinterpreted,"
according to the MIA report.</P>
      <P>According to MIA, Lee later commented on a recent statement by
Macedonian Foreign Minister Srdjan Kerim about the settling of
relations between Macedonia and mainland China. "I have never heard
of any country which has established relations with both the People's
Republic of China and the Republic of China," Lee reportedly said.</P>
      <P>MIA also quoted Lee as reporting that Taiwan has provided credit,
financial assistance for hospitals, scholarships, computer equipment,
education and investment in Macedonia's "Bunardjik" free trade zone.</P>

      <P>Some 30 elected representatives and

1 and December 10, the Ministry of Justice announced Friday.</P>
      <P>The ministry made the figures public following an inspection of

indiscriminate, adding that they have acted in cases in which they
find evidence of illegal activities. They stressed that they have
implemented the crackdown without regard for any suspect's rank or

      <P>They also urged all investigators to follow proper legal

      <P>An ambassador's wife and Springfield,
Illinois' Citizen of the Year shared their experiences as longtime
volunteers Friday, a day before the scheduled opening of the
government-sponsored Millennium Cultural Volunteering Seminar.</P>
      <P>Celestina Diaz de Valdez, wife of the Paraguayan ambassador to
the Republic of China, is currently a volunteer at the Taipei
Municipal Zoo, while Guerry L. Suggs, who was invited to speak at the
seminar organized by the Council for Cultural Affairs, has been a
volunteer for over 25 years and is currently an Illinois State Museum
trustee.</P>
      <P>Suggs said that volunteering in what is now the United States can
be traced back to 1641, adding that a 1995 Gallup poll showed that
over half of American adults have done volunteer work at one time or
another.</P>
      <P>Suggs went on to say that volunteering is also a good way to meet
new people when one moves to a new community.</P>
      <P>"Volunteering can be considered as second nature to Americans,"
Suggs said, adding that it is a "way of life" and a kind of social
responsibility.</P>
      <P>Valdez, who has been in Taiwan for three years and recently
volunteered to donate her time and knowledge of animal care to the
city, said that being a volunteer is the most direct and meaningful
way to promote exchanges between people.</P>
      <P>Explaining simply that she likes animals, Valdez said she began
to devote her time to the zoo two months ago. Before that, she had
also volunteered to provide guidance in English courses at a local
elementary school attended by one of her three children.</P>
      <P>Her children do not attend private foreign schools, but rather
local ones. She explained that local public schools give them the
chance to mix with Taiwanese students, which will give them a better
understanding of Taiwan's culture.</P>
      <P>Despite a lack of monetary or material rewards, she said that a
volunteer can garner a sense of satisfaction from cultural exchanges
and learning about different languages, lifestyles, and customs.</P>

    <HEADLINE>INT'L ANALYSTS: POL. INSTABILITY TO SLOW TAIWAN GDP GROWTH IN 2001</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>London, Dec. 15 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Political instability in Taiwan will dampen
the nation's annual economic growth to 5.2 percent in 2001 following
growth of 6.4 percent in 2000, according to a report published by The
Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU), an international economic analysis
firm.</P>
      <P>In its "2001: country by country" report, EIU also forecast that
Taiwan consumer prices will rise by an average of 1.7 percent in
2001. The local currency will weaken and the current account surplus
will fall to only $US2.1 billion in 2001 from US$3 billion this year,
it added.</P>
      <P>The report noted that an "unprecedented degree" of political
instability will also disrupt Taiwan's relations with mainland China.</P>
      <P>Weak share prices will reduce the scope for companies to raise
equity finance, creating pressure for weaker firms, which may find
that banks are restricting credit because of their high levels of
non-performing loans, it said.</P>
      <P>But the report also pointed out that the high sales and export
growth achieved by many of Taiwan's electronics firms in 2000 will
prompt continued capacity-increasing investment in the sector.
Private-sector investment growth is expected to increase further, as
high-tech companies upgrade their production facilities to supply
higher-specification products.</P>
      <P>It also forecast that government projects will play a part in
this robust investment growth, and predicted that the new
administration will honor the wide-ranging market-opening commitments
made by the previous government in its attempt to secure membership
in the World Trade Organization.</P>
      <P>The report said Taiwan's political instability in 2001 stems from
Mr. Chen Shui-bian's victory in the March 2000 presidential election
and his Democratic Progressive Party's failure to gain a majority in
the Legislative Yuan, which is still dominated by the Kuomintang.</P>
      <P>The report said that Chen's hand will be strengthened if the
Democratic Progressive Party improves its position following the
legislative elections in late 2001. An increase in the number of DPP
legislators in the poll would allow the president to introduce more
of the party's members into the Cabinet, and calm tensions between
the Legislative and Executive Yuans.

    <HEADLINE>CHEN CALLS FOR BUILDING CROSS-STRAIT MILITARY MUTUAL-TRUST MECHANISM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  15  (CNA)
(By Bear Lee)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian called for the
establishment of a military mutual-trust mechanism Friday so as to
avoid misunderstandings and misjudgment on both sides.</P>
      <P>Chen made the call while meeting a group of foreign scholars who
were taking part in a one-day forum titled "Taiwan Security in the
Year 2000: Retrospect and Prospects," which was sponsored by the
Taiwan Research Institute.</P>
      <P>Chen said that peace in the Taiwan Strait is the pillar of
security for the Asian-Pacific region and therefore in the interests
of the United States.</P>
      <P>The President stressed that ever since his inauguration on May.
20, he has done his best to improve cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>By exercising self-restraint and not provoking or challenging
mainland China, he has successfully prevented the cross-trait ties
from deteriorating, he said.</P>
      <P>Chen added that his next step will be to begin handling the
cross-strait ties in accordance with the consensus of the "three
understandings and four suggestions" -- the conclusion reached
recently by the Presidential Advisory Group on Cross-strait
Relations.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that the body's consensus includes that any change to
Taiwan's status quo must be agreed upon by the people of Taiwan in
accordance with democratic procedures, and that an official response
to mainland China's "one China" principle should be determined in
line with the Republic of China Constitution.</P>
      <P>The president emphasized that Taiwan-mainland relations should
not be characterized by "one side trying to destroy the other," but
rather by both sides coming up with a "win-win" situation.</P>
      <P>In answering questions raised by the visitors, Chen said that the
leaders of both Taiwan and the mainland should sit down now and
jointly seek to come up with a mutually-acceptable definition of "one
China."</P>
      <P>He also urged the United States to play a more active role in
promoting peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Forum participants included Dr. Desmond J. Ball, professor of
Strategic and Defense Studies Centre at National Australian
University; professor Michael B. Yahuda, convenor of the
International Relations Department at The London School of Economics
and Political Science; and Dr. Hidenori Ijiri, professor at Tokyo

      <P>Vice Defense Minister Sun Tao-yu denied an analysis report
released recently by Canada's national security and intelligence
bureau that identifies some 10 nations, including Taiwan, as being
suspected of developing chemical or biological weapons.</P>
      <P>The Canadian intelligence report even pointed out that Taiwan has
so far developed 36 types of bacteria to be used for biological
warfare.</P>
      <P>Calling the report "absolutely wrong," Sun reiterated the
Republic of China's set policy of not developing nor owning nuclear,
chemical, or biological weapons, stressing that this position will
not change.</P>
      <P>Sun added, however, that although Taiwan will never develop nor
own nuclear, chemical or biological weapons, it has researched and
developed anti-chemical and anti-biological warfare equipment and
related know-how.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Sun said, the long-planned Military Procurement
Bureau, which will combine the existing Military Procurement Bureau,
the military Chungshan Institute of Science and Technology, and the
General Headquarters into one agency, is expected to be formally
established in one year.</P>
      <P>A preparatory department responsible for the planning of the
establishment of the cross-sectional bureau, which is expected to
have a staff of some 8,000 people, is scheduled to become operational
on Feb. 1, Sun added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NEW ROC FACTORY OPENS IN PANAMA'S FORT DAVID EPZ</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Panama  City,  Dec.  15 (CNA)
(By Chung Hai-tai and Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Colon's provincial governor and the
mayor of Colon City jointly presided over a Taiwan businessman's
recent factory-opening ceremony in an export processing zone (EPZ)
that was established in cooperation with the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>Governor Luciana de Policani and Mayor Jorge Boedanea
congratulated Tu Chien-chung for launching his second plastic factory
in Panama's Fort David EPZ and urged other ROC businessmen to follow
suit to help promote Panama's economic development.</P>
      <P>The Panamanian officials called on Taiwan businessmen to make
their own investments and establish their own factories within the
EPZ in order to create more employment opportunities for Panamanian
citizens in the region.</P>
      <P>In addition to the ROC-Panama EPZ joint venture, Colon is also
home to a free trade zone where over 300 companies enjoy tariff-free
import and export benefits.</P>
      <P>Tu told the Panamanian officials and the 30-some ROC diplomatic
officials and businessmen at the ribbon-cutting ceremony that the
plastic mold injection system in his new factory was imported from
Taiwan and that it is the most advanced system of its kind in the
central American and Caribbean region, capable of producing 2,000
plastic chairs a day.</P>
      <P>Although the almost fully automated factory does not require a
lot of manpower, expanded production in the future will provide 50 to
70 employment opportunities for Panama's third largest city, where
the unemployment rate runs as high as 30 percent, Tu said.</P>
      <P>A former ROC military attache to Chile and Argentina, Tu is
fluent in Spanish and was first persuaded by former ROC Economics
Minister P.K. Chiang to head up Fort David's administrative office
when the EPZ was established in 1996. He later started his own
manufacturing business in a region mostly dominated by import and
export-centered companies.</P>
      <P>He urged the ROC government to provide more assistance to Taiwan
businessmen who invest in nations with which the Republic of China
has formal diplomatic ties because, in his view, hiring local workers
is also a kind of diplomatic investment.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The number two man in the major opposition
Kuomintang denied Saturday that he is organizing a finance and
economics society that will offer tips to help redress the existing
financial and economic problems that the new government is facing.</P>
      <P>KMT Vice Chairman Vincent Siew disclosed, however, that he is
actively involved in research work pushing for the establishment of a
common market across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Siew, who had served as the head of the Cabinet-level Council for
Economic Planning and Development and the Mainland Affairs Council
before serving as the premier from September 1997 to May 2000, has in
recent months advocated the idea that trade should be the axis of
cross-strait relations and that both sides of the Taiwan Strait
should establish a common market.</P>
      <P>Siew, a seasoned expert in economic affairs, said that when the
time is ripe, he and his friends will announce the establishment of a
foundation that will jointly promote the idea of a cross-strait
common market.</P>
      <P>Siew categorically denied that he has met with former President
and KMT Chairman Lee Teng-hui in recent days to discuss ways to help
the new government solve Taiwan's financial and economic problems.</P>
      <P>He also dismissed allegations that he is organizing his own
society because of his walking "on a different path" from KMT
Chairman Lien Chan.</P>
      <P>He said that he is content with his current life of teaching,

    <HEADLINE>SPEAKER RULES OUT POSSIBILITY OF EX-PRESIDENT FORMING NEW PARTY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  16  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng
Saturday ruled out the possibility of former President Lee Teng-hui
and his supporters forming a new political party.</P>
      <P>Wang, also a vice chairman of the main opposition Kuomintang
(KMT), said he has "100%" or even "10,000%" not heard of
such kind of information.</P>
      <P>Wang, who is widely known to have maintained close ties with
Lee, also a former KMT chairman, said he doesn't believe that Lee's
supporters would form a new political party.</P>
      <P>"If that is true, the move would certainly hurt the KMT's unity
and strength," Wang said, adding he is convinced that such a scenario
is unlikely to become reality.</P>
      <P>Speculation that Lee's supporters might split away from the KMT
to form a new party arose after Liu Tai-ying, chairman of the Taiwan
Research Institute, a private think tank, suggested that current
ruling and opposition parties merge among themselves to become a
mainstream party that can command a comfortable majority in the
legislature to maintain domestic political stability.</P>
      <P>Liu, a Lee protege who once served as the KMT's top financial
manager, said he believes that no domestic political party would be
able to win more than half of seats in the legislature after the
next parliamentary election slated for late 2001.</P>
      <P>In his view, Liu said, the existence of a number of small
parties would hinder domestic political stability and smooth
government operation.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan cannot afford a war of attrition among
rivaling political parties, Liu said Taiwan needs a major political
party that can represent mainstream public opinion and control
majority seats in the legislature to maintain political stability
and facilitate domestic economic development.</P>
      <P>Liu said Taiwan should learn from Japanese experience in
party restructuring. According to Liu, Japan's current Liberal
Democratic Party (LDP) was formed through merger of two parties more
than 30 years ago. The LDP then managed to take the helm of the
Japanese government for three decades and transform Japan into a
global economic powerhouse.</P>
      <P>Since President Chen Shui-bian took office in Taiwan's first
democratic transfer of power between different political parties in
May, Taiwan has been plagued by political wrangling between Chen's
minority government and the opposition-dominated legislature.</P>
      <P>The KMT still controls a firm majority in the 220-seat
legislature after losing the presidency to the Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP), which holds hardly one-third of the
legislative seats.</P>
      <P>Judging from the current domestic political situation, Liu said
he does not think that any local party, including the KMT, the
DPP and two other opposition parties -- the People First Party and
the New Party -- would be able to win more than half of the
parliamentary seats in next year's election.</P>
      <P>Therefore, Liu said he hopes that existing political parties can
merge into a large new party to help ensure political stability and
fast economic development following next year's parliamentary
election.</P>
      <P>Liu, a trained economist, said he himself has no interest in
organizing a new party. "Former President Lee is also unlikely to
assume such a mission. He would at most agree to serve as a
spiritual leader of the proposed new party," Liu said, adding that he
hopes to see younger politicians, such as President Chen, push for
the formation a mainstream party to maintain domestic political
stability and ensure smooth economic development which is Taiwan's
lifeline.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  16  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China National Police
Administration (NPA) is moving to increase its preparedness in
maintaining national security and social order on the offshore
islands of Kinmen and Matsu as Taiwan prepares to open the "mini
three links" with mainland China in the near future, NPA sources said
Saturday.</P>
      <P>In the face Taiwan's imminent implementation of direct trade,
mail, and shipping links between the ROC's frontline islands of
Kinmen and Matsu and mainland China's port cities of Xiamen and
Mawei, the NPA has mapped out plans aimed at reinforcing national
security and social order on the islands, NPA officials said.</P>
      <P>In a briefing to Interior Minister Chang Po-ya, NPA officials
said initial attention will be focused on Kinmen's Liaoluo Bay and
Matsu's Fuao Bay where a public safety mechanism responsible for
reacting to emergencies or any sudden unexpected situations will be
set up.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, to prevent mainland Chinese citizens from conducting
illicit activities that threaten to undermine the security and social
order on Kinmen and Matsu, a notification system connecting local
governments, law enforcement authorities, and local citizen's
boroughs will also be established before long.</P>
      <P>To prevent mainlanders from sneaking into Taiwan proper after
legally landing on Kinmen or Matsu, the officials said that all
entries of mainland citizens visiting the offshore counties will come
with identified entry and exit date.</P>
      <P>For her part, Interior Minister Chang said she fully understands
the pressure that Kinmen and Matsu security and customs authorities
are facing at a time when the "mini three links" are set to be
implemented.</P>
      <P>She said she will press the Executive Yuan to pay more attention
to the real and urgent needs of Kinmen and Matsu, stressing that
extra funds and manpower are definitely required at the present time
in order to ensure a smooth implementation of the "mini three links."</P>

(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian
said Saturday in a written statement to the ROC chapter of the World
League for Freedom and Democracy that the league should continue to
share Taiwan's democratic experiences with the rest of the world.</P>
      <P>Chen said in the congratulatory statement, which was delivered at
the chapter's general assembly, that to rule by democracy is a global
trend that is the most suitable way of life for mankind at the
moment. Freedom and human rights are universal values that should be
given attention and guarantees by all governments, he added.</P>
      <P>The president said that the Republic of China on Taiwan has
experienced countless difficulties and obstacles over the past 50
years of promoting democracy and developing economic prosperity.
Today's law and order, he continued, is the fruit of every citizen's
labor and as such should be cherished.</P>
      <P>Creating a stable, peaceful, secure, and dignified living
environment is the new government's primary goal, he said.</P>
      <P>Chen urged the league's ROC chapter to reach out to all the
freedom-loving people in the world and strive together for mankind's
common welfare and peace.</P>
      <P>ROC Premier Chang Chun-hsiung, Legislative Yuan President Wang
Jin-pyng, and Examination Yuan President Hsu Shui-teh also attended
the general assembly, which was presided over by the chapter's
president Yao Eng-chi, who concurrently serves as the vice president
of the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Yao is currently embroiled in a dispute with former Tamkang
University President Clement C.P. Chang over who is the rightful
president of the league -- formerly an anti-communist branch of the
government. Both claim to be the legally elected league president
because two separate elections were held by their respective camps'
supporters at the same time in November.</P>
      <P>Yao said that he is willing to invite Chang to be the league's
honorary chairman who is in charge of all league affairs excluding
those of the local chapters, adding that the two of them can split
the government-allotted budget. However, Chang has not agreed to such
an arrangement.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PROSECUTOR-GENERAL ACCUSED OF ILLEGALLY DETAINING RETIRED OFFICER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  16 (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The son and daughter of retired Vice Adm.
Lei Hsueh-ming pressed charges Saturday against the state public
prosecutor general for "illegally detaining" Lei since Sept. 24 to
question his alleged role in a naval procurement graft case.</P>
      <P>Lei Chun and Ms. Lei Chien first submitted a plea at the Taipei
District Court urging the judge to immediately release their father
because of a Taiwan High Court ruling the previous day that denied a
district prosecutor's request to continue holding the aging Lei, 73,
incommunicado.</P>
      <P>To avoid encroaching on the elder Lei's human rights, Lei Chun
said that there should be no delay in releasing his father as the
high court ruling effectively rescinded a previous court order
allowing the prosecutors to hold him in custody.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, Lei said that detaining his father was originally
intended as a way to assist in solving the graft case. However, the
elder Lei has not been interviewed once by the special task force
assigned to investigate the case during his two months spent in
isolation, Lei added.</P>
      <P>Later in the day, Lei turned to the district prosecutor's office
to lay charges against Prosecutor-General Lu Ren-fa, Taiwan High
Court prosecutor Hung Wei-hua, and Taipei district prosecutor Hsueh
Chung-hsing for what he alleges is their illegal detention of the
elder Lei and their violation of his rights.</P>
      <P>The retired vice admiral has been accused by the special task
force of first concealing the price quoted by a French shipyard that
built the Lafayette missile frigates that the Republic of China Navy
purchased, giving a fabricated higher quote and then reporting a
false final procurement price from which he received kickbacks.</P>
      <P>Although he was directly involved in the entire ship purchasing
evaluation process as a former director of the ROC Navy's weapon
acquisition programs, Lei has denied masterminding or covering up any
plans to fabricate the purchase price.</P>
      <P>The special investigation task force was ordered by President
Chen Shui-bian on July 31 to look into the case after press reports
in France said that huge kickbacks were paid to Taiwan officials
involved in the frigate purchase.</P>
      <P>The controversial procurement scandal first received public
attention after the 1994 death of ROC Navy Capt. Yin Ching-feng, who
was the executive secretary of the navy's weapons acquisition
programs at the time of his death.</P>
      <P>He is widely believed to have been murdered because he was about
to blow the whistle on corrupt officers, but a six-year investigation
into his death by a joint military and police task force turned up
little evidence.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENTIAL RESIDENCE OPENED FOR VISIT BY MENTALLY CHALLENGED KIDS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Dec.  16  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian's official
residential compound in downtown Taipei was opened for visits by
journalists and a group of mentally challenged children Saturday.</P>
      <P>This was the first time that the local news media was offered a
glimpse into the Republic of China president's tightly guarded
official residence at the intersection of Chungching S. Road and
Aikuo W. Road near the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>President Chen and First Lady Wu Shu-chen showed up at the main
entrance to greet the visitors. Chen then served as a guide,
leading the visitors to tour the complex's main building where the
first family will live for the rest of the president's four-year
tenure.</P>
      <P>Chen and his family have actually been living in their own home
on Taipei's Mingsheng E. Road since he took office in May because the
presidential residence has been undergoing renovations.</P>
      <P>Chen said the main building of the compound has not undergone any
major changes besides the addition of certain facilities, including
an elevator, for the convenience of his wheelchair-confined wife.</P>
      <P>The president's aides said that renovations to the two-story main
building have been completed and that the first family will be able
to move into its new home once refurbishments of the security guards'
dormitory adjacent to the main building are finalized.</P>
      <P>According to Chen's aides, the first family will move into the
official residence sometime between Christmas and the Chinese New
Year, which falls on Jan. 24.</P>
      <P>The compound of the presidential residence covers a land area of
about 18,000 square feet. It has a spacious courtyard and garden
where a number of wood carvings and stone sculptures created by noted
artist Ju Ming are on display. Chen's aides said all the exhibits in
the garden were lent by their creator for a one-year exhibition.</P>
      <P>The first floor of the main building includes a drawing room and
a dining room. On the main wall of the drawing room hangs a landscape
oil painting featuring Mt. Kuanyin (the Chinese goddess of mercy)
located in northern Taiwan. The painting was created by Lee Tze-fan,
the father of Academia Sinica President Lee Yuan-tseh, a Nobel
Prize-winning chemist.</P>
      <P>President Chen jokingly described the drawing room as a "hall of
Taiwan images" because all of the paintings and other decorations on
display were created by Taiwanese artists and feature local scenes
and themes.</P>
      <P>Chen said all the paintings in the drawing room were borrowed
from his friends for a one-year display. As all of the works are
considered invaluable, they have been insured for NT$150 million
(US$4.55 million).</P>
      <P>The second floor of the main building is comprised mainly of
bedrooms, which were not open to the media during this visit.</P>
      <P>After giving a guided tour of the main building, President Chen
and his wife proceeded to the courtyard to watch dance performances
put on by a group of mentally challenged children. Chen said he was
moved by the children's performances as they had obviously put a lot
of time and effort into rehearsing and practicing their dance skills.</P>
      <P>At the conclusion of the performances, the president presented
stamp albums and wrist watches to the children as gifts.</P>

    <HEADLINE>RETIRED WARSHIP SUNK IN WATERS OFF PENGHU AS ARTIFICIAL REEF</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Penghu, Taiwan, Dec. 16 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A retired warship was intentionally
sunk in waters off Taiwan's offshore county of Penghu Saturday to
form an artificial reef and facilitate conservation of the island's
offshore fishery resources.</P>
      <P>The supply ship "Ling-Yun" was sunk in waters off Chimei, a
small islet of the Penghu archipelago early in the morning under the
supervision of officials from the Fishery Administration of the
Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture (COA).</P>
      <P>It was the second retired naval vessel to be remodeled into an
artificial reef. The first warship-turned-reef was sunk in waters
off northeastern Taiwan's Ilan County in mid-November. The Republic
of China's naval authority donated the two retired supply ships to
the COA last year for fishery resources conservation purposes.</P>
      <P>COA officials said many traditional fishing countries have used
artificial reefs -- places to rest and breed for fish -- in recent
years to conserve fishing resources.</P>
      <P>COA sources said the council sent officials to attend a seminar
in the United States in July this year to learn from foreign
expertise and experience in transforming warships into artificial
reefs.</P>
      <P>As part of its efforts to improve the environment of Taiwan's
major fishing grounds, the COA has launched a program to create
artificial reefs to preserve fishery resources. In addition to
warships, the COA has used other waste materials, including waste
facility poles donated by state-run Taiwan Power Co., to form
artificial reefs.</P>
      <P>Fishery officials urged local fishermen to cherish all those new
facilities and work together with the government to conserve fishing
resources.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Manila hopes to strengthen its labor and
economic partnership with Taipei now that the issues of the bilateral
dispute over direct flights between the two countries and Taiwan's
ban on hiring Philippine workers have been solved, a Philippine
official said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Taipei lifted the ban on the hiring of Philippine laborers for
the domestic construction sector and other industries on Dec. 5, and
flights between Manila and Taipei were resumed in early October after
a nearly yearlong suspension due to the dispute over flight rights.</P>
      <P>Philippine Labor Minister Bienvenido Laguesma said he hopes that
with the lifting of the ban on the hiring of Philippine labor in
early December, Manila and Taipei can strengthen bilateral ties and
prevent the recurrence of disputes that could result in strained
relations between the two sides.</P>
      <P>Laguesma said that after Taipei announced the suspension on the
hiring of Philippine laborers, the number of Philippine laborers
coming to Taiwan to work decreased by 30 percent.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 17 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former President Lee Teng-hui denied Sunday
any knowledge that his political supporters are mulling the
possibility of forming a new political movement to represent
"mainstream political thought".</P>
      <P>Emerging from a church in Tahsi, Taoyuan County after worship
services, Lee brushed aside questions shouted by waiting reporters
about the formation of a new political movement.</P>
      <P>Before entering his car and leaving, Lee only said "I have never
heard anything about it before and have no idea."</P>
      <P>Rumors were rife in Taipei political circles after one of Lee's
former confidants, the former chief of the Kuomintang's Business
Management Committee, proposed the formation by Lee's political
supporters of a new political movement to represent "mainstream
political thought" and to help the country weather the current
political turmoil.</P>
      <P>Lee quit politics after the candidate of the Kuomintang under
Lee's leadership was defeated in March's presidential election. His
followers within the party were displeased with the Kuomintang's
policy of reaching out to members who had deserted the party prior to
the presidential election because of their disapproval of Lee's
policies of so-called "Taiwanization".</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Chief of the General Staff Adm. Liu
Ho-chien on Saturday vehemently denied any involvement in the scandal
surrounding the Republic of China Navy's purchase of six French-made
frigates in 1991.</P>
      <P>"I should be put to death by being chopped to pieces if I had any
role in it," Liu was quoted by Legislator Lee Ching-hwa as saying.</P>
      <P>Liu, who was the head of the ROC Navy between 1983-1988 and
executed the purchase of the controversial Lafayette-class frigates
while serving as the Chief of General Staff between 1992-1995, also
denied that he had anything to do with the death of naval Capt. Yin
Ching-feng in 1993, Lee said.</P>
      <P>Yin, the executive director of the navy's arms acquisition
programs at the time, was apparently murdered Dec.9, 1993. He had
been accused of wrongdoing in a letter to then-President Lee Teng-hui
and was reportedly threatening to defend himself by going public with
the alleged improprieties surrounding the ROC Navy's acquisition
programs before his body was found drifting in the naval harbor in
Ilan.</P>
      <P>It was the discovery of Yin's body and allegations that kickbacks
were involved in the frigate deal that prompted the Taipei
authorities to look into the circumstances surrounding the sale.</P>
      <P>Lee quoted Liu as confiding in him during a six-hour conversation
on Saturday that Yin had reported to him what Yin suspected were
irregularities surrounding the Lafayette deal after a trip to France
in 1993.</P>
      <P>Liu said that Yin was probably murdered for threatening to reveal
the alleged wrongdoings surrounding the US$2.8 billion deal.</P>
      <P>Lee said that Liu expressed regret over the fact that Yin's
family accused him of being the mastermind behind Yin's death and
that he was one of the ROC Navy leaders who most aggressively pursued
the case.</P>
      <P>Liu said he once even instructed the navy investigators to
contact an alleged conjurer in a desperate effort to gain clues into
the causes of Yin's death.</P>
      <P>In a related development, a retired navy vice admiral who was
detained for investigation in connection with the death of Yin was
released Saturday night after his detention order was vacated by a
court.</P>
      <P>Vice Admiral Lei Hsueh-ming was freed by the Taipei Detention
Center late Saturday after being detained by prosecutors for 84 days.</P>
      <P>The 72-year-old Lei was questioned Sept. 24 in connection with
Yin's death after authorities reopened the probe into the unsolved
case. He was then detained for "inflating the price of the
Lafayettes" to benefit the manufacturers, an allegation which he
denied.</P>
      <P>His two-month detention was extended for another two months at
the request of the prosecutors on Nov. 24. But the extension request,
after being approved by the lower court, was revoked by the high
court Wednesday after Lei's appeal.</P>
      <P>Lei, who is the highest-ranking officer to have been detained in
the case, returned to his Taipei home Saturday night and attended a
church service with his family Sunday morning.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>James Soong, chairman of the opposition
People First Party, said Sunday that his party will become the "third
option" of the people.</P>
      <P>Soong made the remarks at the inauguration of the federation of
the associations of James Soong's friends at the Lai Lai Sheraton
Hotel in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that the public was not satisfied with the previous
government of the Kuomintang and is also not at ease with the present
government under the Democratic Progressive Party, he said that his
party wants to be the "third option" of the people.</P>
      <P>He said that his party wants to forge the mainstream views of
society, stressing that the PFP aims to find the causes of Taiwan's
woes and bring back dynamism to the island.</P>
      <P>Not hiding his worries about the future of Taiwan, he said that
Taiwan faces problems with respect to cross-strait relations, the
economy, ethnic relations, and political reforms.</P>
      <P>He said that "Taiwan is ill," and "in serious condition," adding
that surveys have shown that more than 70 percent of the people
believe that Taiwan's economy will turn for the worse next year and
that more than 40 percent are afraid of losing their jobs.</P>
      <P>He cited the example of the fact that when he first learned to
speak Taiwanese, the island was awash with money, but less than a
decade later, the island has become plagued with debt.</P>
      <P>He also criticized the current "no haste, be patient" policy
toward investment in the mainland, noting the mainland is stepping up
efforts to woo Taiwan investors.</P>
      <P>On Taiwan's economic problems, he urged the government to deal
with the situation as both sides of the Taiwan Strait prepare to
enter the World Trade Organization, likely some time next year.</P>
      <P>Soong also said clearly that his party will not merge with any
other parties, but will instead seek cooperation across party lines.</P>
      <P>He said that the PFP will work with two former chairman of the
now ruling Democratic Progressive Party, Hsu Hsin-liang and Shih
Ming-teh, and with Sisy Chen, former director of the DPP's Publicity
Department, and also reformers in the opposition Kuomintang and New
Party.</P>
      <P>But Soong also said that the PFP will not compromise its
principles and ideals and will serve as the backbone of society. He
added that his party will do its best in the elections of legislators
and city and county chiefs at the end of next year.</P>
      <P>Soong, a former heavyweight of the KMT, quit the party to run on
his own in the March presidential election. He finished a close
second in the race, trailing the DPP's candidate Chen Shui-bian by
about 300,000 votes.</P>
      <P>The associations of James Soong's friends played a key role in
Soong's showing in the presidential race, and the inauguration of the
federation aims to translate his personal popularity into support for
the party, sources said.</P>

      <P>A foundation aiming to improve Taiwan's
health care system called its first preparatory conference Sunday and
disclosed the results of the first polls it conducted revealing many
people's disapproval with the medical care they have received under
the current system.</P>
      <P>Chang Li-yung, one of the organizers of the Taiwan Foundation for
Health Reform, said he was inspired to form the foundation because of
the miserable treatment he and his family have received in Taiwan's
health care system.</P>
      <P>He criticized the fact that the current profit-oriented health
care system has reduced medical workers to "slave laborers" who are
more concerned about efficiency than about the patients.</P>
      <P>Patients, especially the elderly, women, and children, often do
not receive appropriate medical treatment, said Chang.</P>
      <P>Citing a poll commissioned by the foundation, Chang said more
than half of those surveyed said that they were not informed of their
disease after the diagnosis and that they were unaware of what
medication their doctors had prescribed to them.</P>
      <P>The poll of 1,077 people who had seen a doctor at least once
within the previous three months also found that nearly 50 percent of
respondents said their doctors took less than five minutes to
diagnose them. Eight percent said their doctors finished their
diagnosis in less than two minutes, although the average time for a
visit to the doctor is one hour.</P>
      <P>The poll also found that the more education one receives, the
more they are displeased with the treatment they receive in the
present health care system.</P>
      <P>In order to improve the medical care system in Taiwan, Chang
sought 500 sponsors, with each donating NT$1,000 per month, to
finance the foundation.</P>

      <P>A senior official of the Central Bank of
China suggested Sunday that the two sides of Taiwan Strait set up a
mechanism to promote East Asian financial cooperation after they are
admitted into the World Trade Organization.</P>
      <P>Lee Sheng-yen, director of the Banking Department of the CBC,
said that as Taiwan and mainland China are set to enter the WTO soon,
it is necessary to set up a financial cooperation mechanism so as to
prevent a financial crisis from happening.</P>
      <P>Lee, making the remarks during a keynote speech at the first
Taiwan-Japan International Seminar, said Taiwan and mainland China
will not only have to face the effects of opening their local markets
to more international competition, but will also have to deal with
the shock to local financial markets brought by the easing of
controls on capital inflows.</P>
      <P>Lee said that although the banking institute has imposed adequate
controls when implementing capital liberalization measures, this
mechanism will not be sufficient to prevent a financial crisis from
unfolding.</P>
      <P>Therefore, in order to prevent such a crisis from occurring, both
Taiwan and mainland China should set up a cooperation mechanism to
promote financial cooperation in East Asia after both are admitted
into the WTO, he said, adding that this will also help improve cross

      <P>Results of a public opinion survey showed
that a great majority of farmers are not well aware of what the
impact of Taiwan's entry into the World Trade Organization will be.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for the survey organizing committee said this
indicates that the relevant government agencies should put more
effort into explaining the positive and negative impacts of Taiwan's
admittance into the WTO.</P>
      <P>The Public Administration Society of the Republic of China
randomly interviewed 1,071 farmers across the island between Dec. 3
to Dec. 9.</P>
      <P>Of those interviewed, 85.3 percent said they knew that the ROC
will soon be admitted into the WTO, and 69.1 percent said they were
aware that the government will have to open the local agricultural
and livestock market and lift a lot of import bans on agricultural
products from other countries.</P>
      <P>The same poll showed that 51.7 percent of respondents do not know
that the government will have to cancel all the current agricultural
subsidies after Taiwan is formally admitted into the WTO.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 73.8 percent of respondents said they believe that WTO
admission will bring more negative impacts than benefits, and 54.9
percent said they believe Taiwan's agriculture sector is not
competitive enough to deal with the shock to be brought by the
island's WTO entry.</P>
      <P>In the same survey, 84.5 percent of respondents said that they
will continue to work in the farm industry after Taiwan is admitted
into WTO, and 56.2 percent said they are worried they may lose their
job after Taiwan's WTO entry.</P>
      <P>Legislator Hsiao Wan-yu of the Kuomintang said the survey results

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN TO DISCUSS WITH M'LAND USE OF RENMINBI AFTER "THREE MINI LINKS"</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 17 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>After the implementation of the "mini three
links" between the two outlying Republic of China islands Kinmen and
Matsu and mainland China, Taiwan will have to discuss with the
mainland the issue of the use of the renminbi before the currency can
be used on the two islands, an official in charge of mainland policy
said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Chen Ming-tung, vice chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council,
said that direct trade, postal, and transport links are scheduled to
be inaugurated on January 1, 2001 and that the renminbi will not be
used in Kinmen and Matsu during the initial stage.</P>
      <P>Chen said that this is because Taiwan is not a member of the
International Monetary Fund, adding that Taiwan will have to discuss
with the mainland the issue of the currency settlement basis and make
sure that the mainland will buy back the renminbi before it allows
the use of the currency on the islands.</P>
      <P>In addition to the concerns about the currency, he also stressed
that the government will have to make plans to ensure the maintenance
of social order on Kinmen and Matsu, adding that the Coast Guard
Administration, the Ministry of National Defense, and the National
Police Administration will join forces to work out the plan to ensure
an effective trade environment.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks while appearing on a program on a Taiwan
television station concerning the "mini three links" and plans for
the establishment of direct links between Taiwan proper and the
mainland.</P>
      <P>Legislator Chen Ching-pao of the opposition Kuomintang, speaking
on the same program, said Taiwan has unilaterally decided to
implement the "mini three links" without communication and
consultation with the mainland.</P>
      <P>Chen again suggested that the government first begin trial
shipping to the mainland in order to gain a better understanding of
the difficulties it may encounter in the future.</P>
      <P>Chang Kuo-cheng, deputy director of the Department of Chinese
Affairs of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party, said that in
consideration of the citizens, national security, and social order,
the DPP has adopted a gradual opening of links between Taiwan and the

    <HEADLINE>POLL FINDS 41% NOT SATISFIED WITH GOVERNMENT'S ECONOMIC POLICY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 17 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Some 41 percent of Taiwan citizens are not
satisfied with the financial and economic policies of President Chen
Shui-bian, the latest poll released Sunday by a think tank of the
opposition Kuomintang showed.</P>
      <P>The National Policy Foundation conducted the survey between
November 26 and December 2 on people over 20 years of age. Some 1,072
valid samples were collected, and the poll is said to have a margin
of error of 2.99 percent.</P>
      <P>The survey found that 58 percent of respondents said they believe
the government should make the economy its number one priority, and
only 12 percent said that the top priority should be social welfare.</P>
      <P>The poll found that if President Chen Shui-bian were unable to
deliver on his campaign promises, around 38 percent of the
respondents said they would not support him, and 17 percent said they
would continue to stand by him.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the poll also indicated that 63 percent are worried
that they or one of their family members will lose their job, while
around 30 percent said that they have no such worries.</P>
      <P>Some 35 percent of those polled also said they want the
government to be more open regarding cross-strait trade policy, 17
percent said the government should be more conservative, and some 26
percent said it should maintain the status quo, while 23 percent said
they have no comment on this question.</P>
      <P>On the issue of the slumping stock market, 19 percent said that
it has been the result of the proposed recall motion by the
opposition coalition, 12 percent attributed it to the unstable
financial policy of the new administration, and nine percent said bad
economic fundamentals were the cause.</P>
      <P>The survey also found that around 47 percent of respondents said
they think that the financial and economic policies of President Chen
are erratic and chaotic.</P>
      <P>National Chengchi University Professor Lin Chu-Chia, commenting
on the poll, said the government's economic policy should be
consistent and stable, adding that the new administration's policy
has instead been erratic, which he said is evidenced by the
controversies surrounding a pay raise for civil servants and the
imposition of a national security tax.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ALCOHOL PRODUCTION TO BE GRADUALLY OPENED TO PRIVATE SECTOR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  18  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government's monopoly on tobacco and
alcoholic drink production is expected to become a thing of the past
after Taiwan enters the World Trade Organization (WTO) next year,
Ministry of Finance sources said Monday.</P>
      <P>Alcoholic drink production will likely be gradually opened to the
private sector over the first three years after Taiwan's WTO
accession, MOF officials said.</P>
      <P>According to an MOF proposal submitted to the Executive Yuan for
approval, the liberalization of alcoholic drink production will be
carried out in four stages during the three years, leading to the
complete privatization of the long-monopolized wine and liquor
industry.</P>
      <P>In the first year after Taiwan's WTO accession, the production of
fruit wines of all varieties will be opened to private companies to
invest in or operate. In the second year, all kinds of fermented
wine, including rice wine but excluding beer, will be opened to the
private sector, according to the proposal.</P>
      <P>In the third year, production of liquors of all varieties will be
opened to private production and investment. The production of beer
products will only be opened to the private sector three years after
Taiwan has joined the WTO.</P>
      <P>In the proposal, the MOF does not suggest that the production of
tobacco and cigarette products be privatized in the first three years
after Taiwan's WTO accession, but it does say it will consider such
an opening under certain special circumstances, MOF officials said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is expected to become a formal member of the WTO sometime
after next April, immediately following mainland China's accession.</P>

understanding."</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>ROC DIPLOMATS EXPECT CLOSER TIES WITH U.S.</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  18  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>U.S. President-elect George W. Bush's
nomination of retired General Colin Powell as his future secretary
of state is expected to facilitate further improvement of
Taipei-Washington relations, a senior diplomat said Monday.</P>
      <P>Liu Chih-kung, director of the North American Affairs
Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA), made the
remarks in response to a press inquiry about his views on Bush's
first cabinet appointment.</P>
      <P>Noting that Powell has been very friendly toward Taiwan, Liu
said he is convinced that Powell's appointment will contribute to
constructive development of substantive ties between the Republic of
China and the United Sates.</P>
      <P>"Given Powell's wide appeal to Americans and a reputation as a
man of honor aloof from the political fray, Powell is believed to
win the U.S. congressional assent to serving as secretary of state
under the incoming Bush administration," Liu said.</P>
      <P>Powell, a Gulf War hero, once visited Taiwan in 1997. Liu said
that visit has enabled Powell to gain a better understanding of
Taiwan's democratic development and economic liberalization.</P>
      <P>Liu said he believes that Powell's first-hand look at
Taiwan's development and his personal experience in observing
relations across the Taiwan Strait during that visit will help
make it easier for the ROC to communicate with the Bush
administration concerning cross-strait issues.</P>
      <P>And against this backdrop, Liu said he is optimistic about
the prospects for further improving ROC-U.S. relations.</P>
      <P>Many other MOFA officials, who preferred anonymity, echoed Liu's
views, saying they believe that substantive cooperation between
Taipei and Washington will become even closer after Bush and Powell
take their new posts.</P>
      <P>For one thing, the officials said optimistically that the new
U.S. administration will more fully consider Taiwan's stance and
America's own interests, not just mainland China's reaction, while
dealing with cross-Taiwan Strait issues.</P>
      <P>As for the current cross-strait deadlock, MOFA officials said,
the ball is now in Beijing's court since the ROC government has on
many occasions held out olive branches to mainland China.</P>
      <P>If mainland China continues to resist resumption of cross-strait
dialogue or refuse any compromise on its certain stances, MOFA
officials said cross-strait relations will remain almost same as
their current state when the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
(APEC) forum holds its annual informal summit meeting next November.
APEC groups 21 economies, including Taiwan, mainland China and the
United States.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Vice Defense Minister Chen Pi-chao said he foresees
no major changes in the U.S. policy on arms sales to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Noting that the United States has consistently adopted a
"balance of power" principle in formulating its policies on the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait, Chen said the new U.S. administration
will continue placing the top priority on its national interest in
mulling arms deals with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Against this background, Chen said, the incoming Bush
administration will follow the past formula in selling defensive
weapons to Taiwan in accordance with the Taiwan Relations Act, a
U.S. law that governs U.S. relations with Taiwan in the absence of
formal diplomatic ties and requires the United States to provide
Taiwan with sufficient defensive arms to help ensure Taiwan's
security.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT CHEN OFFICIATES AT GROUNDBREAKING FOR NEW SOFTWARE PARK</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  Dec.  18  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian on Monday
welcomed the marriage between Taiwan's cutting-edge information
technological industry and the traditional manufacturing industry, a
development he said will help usher the country into the era of the
new knowledge-led economy.</P>
      <P>Addressing a ceremony marking the groundbreaking for the
Kaohsiung Software Technology and Industrial Park, Chen said the park
will be a new source of pride for southern Taiwan and a point of
embarkation for business and industrial transition in southern
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The software park, to be jointly sponsored by the Ministry of
Economic Affairs and Kaohsiung City Government, will showcase the
cooperation between the central and local governments, not only
serving local needs, but also helping to bolster national
reconstruction, Chen noted.</P>
      <P>The proposed software park, a NT$13 billion investment, will also
serve as a milestone project pushing Taiwan closer toward its goal of
becoming a "green silicon island," the president added.</P>
      <P>Despite concerns about the fact that many Taiwan companies have
begun considering relocating their manufacturing operations to
mainland China to take advantage of China's cheap labor and
production costs and to skirt Taiwan's deteriorating economic
situation, the projected software park has already successfully
solicited investors to a tune of about 70 percent of its target, said
park administration officials.</P>
      <P>Investors which have already forged agreements with the park
administration include Chunghua Telecom, National Sun Yat-sen
University, and the Institute of Information Industry, which aims to
develop wide-band and optic-fiber telecommunications products, park
officials said.</P>
      <P>Park administration officials said that in order to attract and
retain investment in the software park, investors will be entitled to
certain privileges, including long-term low-interest loans and more
convenient land acquisition.</P>
      <P>The park, the first of its kind in southern Taiwan, is expected
to include a 19-story main building and a four-story operations
center. It is expected to become fully operational in April 2002,
creating some 5,000 job opportunities for people in southern Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GOV'T URGED TO IMPROVE HUMAN RIGHTS PROTECTION FOR FOREIGN LABORERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 18 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Labor groups in Taiwan on Monday urged the
government to improve conditions for foreign laborers during their
unveiling of a list of human rights violations that foreign laborers
in Taiwan have experienced.</P>
      <P>On the day declared "International Migrant's Day" by the United
Nations, the groups called on the government to actively improve
conditions, set up a system of shelters and mid-way homes, and
establish a channel for complaints by foreign laborers.</P>
      <P>Labor Front and Rerum Novarum Labor Center invited the fathers
and sisters who have direct contact with foreign laborers to report 
12 types of rights violations that foreign laborers have encountered
in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The violations listed were the stripping of personal and
religious freedom, long working hours and no holidays, different
wages for the same work, the stripping of solidarity, astronomical
brokerage fees, unequal judicial protection, restrictions on movement
and change of employment, a lack of marriage and birth rights, sexual
harassment, contracts that are not drawn on parity, lack of privacy
in place of residence, and racial discrimination.</P>
      <P>Father Edwin Corros of St. Christopher's Church, who has served
foreign laborers in Taiwan for the last seven years, said that the
most serious problem these workers face is high brokerage fees,
pointing out that the fee has risen to more than NT$100,000
(US$3,019). He said that the Republic of China government should work
with foreign laborer exporting countries to set reasonable brokerage
fees.</P>
      <P>Father Corros said that issue of runaway foreign laborers is
another problem, which he said is mostly the result of exorbitant
brokerage fees or the mistreatment of employees.</P>
      <P>He said that although the government has regulations in place to
punish employers who abuse foreign workers, these regulations are not
the proper remedy for addressing the situation.</P>
      <P>Sister Stephana Wei, director of Rerum Novarum Labor Center, said
that residence privacy for domestic helpers and care takers is
especially lacking because they live under the same roof as their
employers.</P>
      <P>Wei said that some domestic helpers and care takers living with
their employers have no privacy at all, pointing out that some rooms
are fitted with transparent glass walls and that some employers
change the locks on doors at random so that they can monitor their
employees at all times.</P>
      <P>Wei also pointed out that current regulations state that foreign
laborers who get pregnant should be repatriated immediately, which
she said ignores the human needs of the foreign laborers.</P>
      <P>She also said that it is not sufficient for the Council of Labor
Affairs to set up a complaint hot line, as employers are able to
almost immediately, within 24 hours, repatriate laborers who file
complaints.</P>
      <P>She suggested that the government provide complaint centers with
the authority to mediate disputes between foreign laborers and their
employers, adding that it should also set up a mid-way home so that
the laborers involved in disputes with their employers have a
temporary residence and are not in danger of being repatriated by
their employer at will.</P>
      <P>The International Labor Organization and World Bank estimates that
there are 150 million migrants in the world, with 97 million of that
total being foreign laborers and their families. Foreign laborers
remit a total of US$73 billion to their home country each year,
according to the estimates.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC FOREIGN TRADE BOARD WEBSITE HACKED INTO</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  18  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Internet website of the Republic of
China's Board of Foreign Trade (BOFT) was broken into on Sunday and
Monday by a hacker suspected of being from mainland China.</P>
      <P>The break-in by the hacker, calling himself the "Old Cat from
Chaozhou" on the BOFT website's homepage, brought back memories of
the wave of computer hacker break-ins into official Republic of China
websites that occurred in 1999 from across the Taiwan Strait, sources
from the BOFT said.</P>
      <P>Fortunately, a firewall -- a device that protects data from
outside intruders -- protected most of the BOFT's database from the
hacker, who was only able to replace the homepage.</P>
      <P>Suspecting that there may have been political motives behind the
intrusion, which occurred between 6 p.m. on Sunday and 9 a.m. on
Monday, related BOFT officials and Internet experts are looking into
the case, hoping to trace back to the source of the break-in.</P>
      <P>Although the hacker's self-proclaimed name suggested that he was
from a mainland Chinese city, BOFT officials do not rule out the
possibility that he is from Taiwan and was just having some malicious
fun.</P>
      <P>Last year, hackers across the Taiwan Strait engaged in a series
of dog-fight style Internet battles with Taiwan authorities after the
mainland Chinese hackers broke into important ROC government agency
websites, including those of the Control Yuan, which is the top
watchdog agency in Taiwan, the National Assembly, and the Ministry of
Justice Investigation Bureau.</P>
      <P>One "Chinese hacker" broke into the Control Yuan website on Aug.
7, 1999, claiming that "there is only one China in the world, and the
world needs only one China." The message was believed to be clearly
aimed at then-ROC President Lee Teng-hui's redefinition of the
Taipei-Beijing relationship as a "special state-to-state" one.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC, U.S. TO ENTER 'STRATEGIC COOPERATION'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  18 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China will formally enter
"strategic cooperation" with the United States when its
military builds up the "net assessment" capability next year,
Ministry of National Defense (MND) sources said Monday.</P>
      <P>According to MND sources, the U.S. military began to assist the
ROC in building up "net assessment" capability after the 1995-96
Taiwan Strait crisis during which time mainland China lobbed missiles
and conducted live-fire military exercises at Taiwan's doorstep in an
attempt to affect the result of the ROC's first direct presidential
election.</P>
      <P>At present, the sources said, several teams of ROC military
officers are receiving relevant training in the United States. "Our
armed forces are expected to acquire full 'net assessment' capability
next year," said an MND official who spoke on condition of
anonymity.</P>
      <P>The official explained that "net assessment" refers to a
quantitative research system comprising a set of calculating
software programs and highly efficient hardware facilities.</P>
      <P>"The U.S.-developed 'net assessment' system will enable us to
evaluate all possible scenarios through simulated warfare on the
basis of quantitative data and information," the official said,
adding that with the assistance of this highly sophisticated
assessment system, the ROC military will be able to shed subjective,
arbitrary elements in traditional military strength evaluation.</P>
      <P>With the return of ROC military officers from the United States
sometime next year, the official went on, Taiwan's armed forces will
establish their own data banks and use the U.S.-developed software
and hardware facilities to work out defense guidelines and strategy
in line with the ROC's basic defense policy and more efficiently
distribute the country's defense resources.</P>
      <P>In fact, the official said, the ROC military already employed
the "net assessment" system and spirit in this year's "Hunching No.
16" combined services military exercise to evaluate its capability to
launch a counterattack in case mainland China uses M-class missiles
to attack Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The official said as the ROC will formally unify its military
command and administrative systems from February 2001, it badly
needs an objective military strength assessment system to enable is
civilian defense minister to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the
country's overall defense resources and armed forces structure.</P>
      <P>According to the new defense law scheduled to take effect next
February, the General Staff Headquarters will come under the
jurisdiction of the Ministry of National Defense.</P>
      <P>In preparation for the overhaul of the ROC's defense
system, the official said the MND's strategic planning department
will open a new "net assessment" office to handle integrated
strategic environment evaluation.</P>
      <P>"The inauguration of the new office will offer our defense
minister more accurate, objective and unbiased counsel in
formulating defense policy and resources distribution plans," the
official noted.</P>
      <P>According to the official, ROC-U.S. military exchanges have
expanded and upgraded after the 1995-96 Taiwan Strait crisis. By
2001, he said, the ROC will become the third country to have
the "net assessment" capability, after the United States and Israel.</P>
      <P>The official further said the MND looks forward to seeing
further breakthroughs in ROC-U.S. military exchanges after
the Bush administration is inaugurated next month.</P>

    <HEADLINE>RUSSIAN-CHINESE COOP'N POSES THREATS TO U.S. AND TAIWAN: EXPERT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Dec.  17 (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Russian-Communist Chinese cooperation
is a clear demonstration of the adversarial nature of the basic
security policies of these two nations toward American interests and
allies and poses serious threats to both Taiwan and the United
States, an American national security expert said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Stephen Blank, professor of national security studies at the
Strategic Studies Institute of the U.S. Army War College, wrote in
the Washington Times that Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov
announced in Beijing last month his government's open support for an
axis consisting of Russia, Communist China, and India if and when
these states decided they wanted one.</P>
      <P>Mr. Kasyanov has also apparently negotiated the sale of an
AWACS-like system to Beijing, thus confirming that Moscow-Beijing
relations have immense significance for Asia and the world and that
the United States is increasingly seen as the main threat to
Communist China, pointed out Blank.</P>
      <P>He noted that the main threat to U.S. interests consists of
Russian arms sales to Communist China that comprise technologies,
weapons, regular staff exchanges on scenarios in the Taiwan Straits
and presumably elsewhere, and intelligence sharing.</P>
      <P>As the Pentagon recently admitted, "a cross-strait conflict
between China and Taiwan involving the United States has emerged as
the dominant scenario guiding People's Liberation Army force
planning, military training, and war preparedness," wrote Blank.</P>
      <P>He added that these weapons transfers are therefore "deliberately
aimed at American forces, allies, partners, and interests."</P>
      <P>The overall pattern of Communist Chinese acquisitions -- and not
just from Russia -- strongly suggests that intimidating or capturing
Taiwan and deterring the United States and its armed forces from
coming to Taiwan's defense is a military priority for Beijing's
leaders and planners, wrote Blank.</P>
      <P>However, he stressed, Moscow-Beijing cooperation against the
United States does not end with threats to Taiwan and the United
States. This intimate relationship has impeded progress toward
Russian-Japanese rapprochement and a formal Russian-Japanese peace
treaty.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A delegation of mainland Chinese civil
aviation administrators arrived in Taiwan Monday for a 10-day
fact-finding visit in preparation for opening direct airlinks across
the Taiwan Strait in the future.</P>
      <P>The 12-member mainland delegation was headed by Yeh Igan,
director of the Huadong (eastern China) Civil Aviation Bureau under
the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC).</P>
      <P>Yeh said although this is his first trip to Taiwan, he has many
friends in Taiwan's civil aviation community.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the two sides of the Taiwan Strait will be able to
forge direct trade, mail and transport links, commonly known as the
"major three links," next year, Yeh said mainland China's civil
aviation community has long been ready for operating direct
cross-strait flight services.</P>
      <P>"As for when direct cross-strait airlinks will become a reality,
it's not a matter that our civil aviation authority can unilaterally
decide," he added.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council is scheduled to unveil a
blueprint for opening direct cross-strait "major three links" in the
first half of next year. As mainland China still refuse to resume
dialogue with Taiwan, it remains uncertain when the
much-anticipated direct cross-strait "major three links," including
flight services, can formally kick off.</P>
      <P>As the opening of direct cross-strait airlinks is expected to
bring about lucrative business opportunities, major Taiwan
carriers have opened liaison offices on the mainland and forged close
ties with their mainland counterparts.</P>
      <P>Members of the mainland delegation include Wang Cunhao, director
of the CAAC's Xinan (southwestern China) Civil Aviation Bureau; Zhang
Shih-hung, deputy director of the Economic Affairs Bureau of the
Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council; Wu Li, deputy director of
the CAAC's Taiwan-Hong Kong-Macau Affairs Office; and chief managers

    <HEADLINE>CABINET TO SET UP 'MINI THREE LINKS' COORDINATION CENTER IN KINMEN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kinmen, Dec. 18 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Executive Yuan will open a coordination
center on the frontline island of Kinmen to ensure smooth opening of
direct "mini three links" across the Taiwan Strait at the beginning
of next year, a cross-strait negotiator said Monday.</P>
      <P>Yen Wan-chin, deputy secretary-general of the Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF), a quasi-official intermediary body authorized by
the Republic of China government to handle exchanges with mainland
China in the absence of official ties, made the remarks after
arriving here to inspect preparations for the "mini three links"
opening.</P>
      <P>Accompanied by Kinmen County Magistrate Chen Shui-tsai, Yen made
an inspection tour of the Chukuang Villa, a Kinmen County Government
estate to accommodate the planned administrative coordination
center.</P>
      <P>Yen said the Executive Yuan, or Cabinet, will unveil a package
of regulations Wednesday to govern the operations of the
coordination center, which is scheduled to become operational on
Dec. 25.</P>
      <P>According to the Cabinet's plan, relevant ministries or
government agencies will take turn in assigning a deputy head to
lead the coordination center. In addition, a senior civil servant
will be named to handle the coordination center's day-to-day
affairs.</P>
      <P>Yen said the coordination center will be authorized to integrate
and coordinate operations of various central and local government
agencies in handling passenger and cargo transport issues and legal
problems that may arise after the opening of direct "mini three
links" between Kinmen and the southeastern mainland Chinese port city
of Xiamen.</P>
      <P>In line with an offshore islands development bill passed by
the Legislative Yuan earlier this year, the ROC government has
decided to open direct "trade, mail and shipping links" between its
defense outposts of Kinmen/Matsu and mainland China's Xiamen/Mawei
in Fujian province, popularly known as "mini three links," on Jan.
1, 2001.</P>
      <P>Noting that the government cannot afford any failing concerning
the opening of "mini three links," Yen said there will be three
mechanisms to ensure smooth operations of direct Kinmen-Xiamen
trade and shipping services.</P>
      <P>In addition to the new coordination center, Yen said, such
central government agencies as customs, quarantine,
immigration and coast guard authorities as well as the Kinmen County
Government will jointly form an administrative and inspection center
at the Liaolo port, the only Kinmen harbor to be opened for "mini
three links" in the initial stage.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Yen said, the military's Kinmen Defense Headquarters
will be responsible for security-related affairs.</P>
      <P>As mainland China still declines to resume dialogue with Taiwan,
Yen said, the enforcement of "mini three links" in the initial stage
will focus on legalizing "small-amount trade" between fishermen on
both sides of the Taiwan Strait that has been going on illegally for
years, as well as on matters that Taiwan can unilaterally handled.</P>
      <P>Yen said so long as mainland China makes goodwill response to
Taiwan's efforts to improve cross-strait ties, the "mini
three links" will be expanded in the second stage to more effectively
help boost Kinmen's development.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GOV'T SETS GOAL OF CREATING 270,000 JOB OPPORTUNITIES</HEADLINE>

(By Edward Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>In order to alleviate the escalating social
pressure caused by the rising unemployment rate in Taiwan, the
Cabinet has decided to implement policies toward the goal of creating
270,000 job opportunities.</P>
      <P>Chang Ping-nan, deputy director-general of the Government
Information Office, said the government will accomplish the set goal
by implementing a series of incentive measures, including the
expansion of vocational training programs and the offering of
subsidies and services for job hunters.</P>
      <P>Chang, who said the government has decided to adopt these
measures after in-depth Cabinet-level task force discussions on the
issue, pointed out that these moves are designed to relieve the
pressures caused by unemployment in the short-term and should not be
considered as thorough solutions to the problem of rising
unemployment.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Premier Chang Chun-hsiung urged all the nation's
public functionaries to make adequate preparations in order to face
any challenges arising at home or abroad. He also exhorted them to
play a more positive role in stabilizing Taiwan's political
situation.</P>
      <P>Chang said that the existence of opposition political parties
will absolutely not be accepted as an excuse for local political
unrest or economic recession.</P>
      <P>The premier made the remarks while attending an award
presentation ceremony honoring outstanding public works during the
year 2000.</P>
      <P>He also categorically denied recent criticism that the Republic
of China was headed for political crisis, saying that he is confident
in the government's ability to maintain a stable democracy on Taiwan.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A medical team will depart for Nepal next
week to provide humanitarian medical assistance in that country,
Legislator Chen Hsei-saint of the opposition Kuomintang said Monday.</P>
      <P>Legislator Chen, who helped inspire the formation of the team,
said the 18-member medical team, headed by Chang Kung Memorial
Hospital doctor Hung Kai-feng, will depart for Nepal Dec. 25.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that each winter, hundreds of Tibetans climb through
high mountains to flee into Nepal. These Tibetans, however, are
unable to receive proper care and suffer from malnutrition when they
arrive in Nepal because of the lack of medical materials and the poor
quality of life there. They sometimes even suffer from frostbite and
have to have limbs amputated, he added.</P>
      <P>Chen said that although the medical team, which has received
government and private assistance for the humanitarian mission, will
stay for only a week, it will serve as a forerunner for follow-up
medial activities.</P>
      <P>He said that cooperation with local medical schools, the
establishment of more permanent medical footholds, and the providing
of better medical services for the Tibetans and local people have not
been ruled out as possibilities.</P>
      <P>The establishment of a medical assistance mechanism in Nepal has
also been considered so as to create favorable conditions for
Taiwan's bid to enter the World Health Organization and to gain
international support for its bid, he said.</P>
      <P>Chueh Sn Tsering, member of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs
Commission, expressed his appreciation for the medical team, saying
that many Tibetans have fled each year to Nepal for the sake of
freedom and human rights.</P>
      <P>He said that those who have applied for Nepalese citizenship
number in the hundreds of thousands, while the number of those who
have yet to apply amounts to more than 30,000, adding that the visit
by the Taiwan medical team will have a positive effect on bilateral
exchanges between the Republic of China and Nepal.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>With the opening of direct "mini three
links" entering a final countdown, the Ministry of Transportation and
Communications (MOTC) said Monday it will soon unveil regulations
governing scheduled shipping services to selected mainland ports.</P>
      <P>As part of its efforts to help boost economic development in the
frontline islands of Kinmen and Matsu, the Republic of China
government has decided to allow direct trade, mail and shipping links
between the two offshore islands and mainland China's Xiamen and
Fuzhou in Fujian Province, commonly known as the "direct mini three
links," from Jan. 1, 2001.</P>
      <P>MOTC officials said the ministry will formally unveil regulations
governing applications for operating scheduled Kinmen-Xiamen and
Matsu-Fuzhou shipping services on Tuesday or Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Interested companies can file applications with relevant harbor
authorities once the package of regulations has been promulgated, the
officials said.</P>
      <P>MOTC sources said 13 shipping firms in the Kinmen area have
expressed interest in operating scheduled shipping services between
Kinmen and Xiamen. Among them, eight companies intend to operate
passenger transport services, four want to operate cargo services and
the remaining one plans to operate both passenger and cargo services.</P>
      <P>To their knowledge, MOTC officials said, there will certainly be
maiden voyages on both the newly opened Kinmen-Xiamen and
Matsu-Fuzhou shipping routes on New Year's Day.</P>
      <P>Shipping firms in Matsu are mainly interested in transporting
pilgrims to mainland China's Fuzhou and Meizhou to pay tribute to the
Chinese goddess of sea, MOTC officials said.</P>
      <P>According to the MOTC regulations, scheduled shipping services
can be offered only between Kinmen's Liaolo port and Fujian's Xiamen
port or between Matsu's Fuao port and Fujian's Mawei port.</P>
      <P>As for chartered shipping services, the MOTC will not impose any
restrictions on mainland destinations. Therefore, local shipping
firms will be able to operate chartered shipping services from either
Kinmen or Matsu to any mainland ports with Beijing's assent.</P>
      <P>MOTC officials said they believe local shippers will focus on
operating chartered direct shipping services from Kinmen/Matsu to
mainland ports in the initial stage because market prospects for
scheduled shipping services remain uncertain.</P>

    <HEADLINE>THINK TANK CHAIRMAN REITERATES NEED FOR UNITED `MAINSTREAM' PARTY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  18  (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The chairman of the Taiwan Research
Institute, a private think tank, reiterated Monday that the country
needs someone to consolidate "mainstream opinion" and form a
political party to effectively promote national development.</P>
      <P>Liu Tai-ying, a former Kuomintang (KMT) top financial manager and
a protege of former Republic of China President Lee Teng-hui,
recently brought up the idea of "unifying the current political
spectrum" in order to create a legislative majority power that can
maintain domestic stability.</P>
      <P>In his view, Liu said two days earlier, the existence of a number
of small parties hinders domestic political stability and smooth
government operation.</P>
      <P>Liu, a trained economist, said that he has no interest in
organizing a new party. "Former President Lee is also unlikely to
assume such a mission. He would at most agree to serve as a spiritual
leader of a proposed new party," Liu said.</P>
      <P>He added that he hopes to see younger politicians, such as
President Chen Shui-bian, push for the formation of a "mainstream
party" to maintain domestic political stability and ensure the smooth
economic development that he described as Taiwan's lifeline.</P>
      <P>At a Monday press conference on Taiwan's economic prospects for
2001, Liu said that next year's year-end legislative, county, and
municipal elections might still leave the political landscape dotted
with numerous parties, none of which has a majority mandate,
especially in the legislature.</P>
      <P>According to Japanese, Italian, and French experience, a minority
ruling party is usually unstable, with frequent no-confidence votes
against the Cabinet that have an immense impact on a country's
economy, he said.</P>
      <P>He again cited Japan's party restructuring as an example of how
the merger of two parties into the Liberal Democratic Party was able
to bring about decades of economic prosperity for Japan, and how that
prosperity was lost when the party split and unity was shattered.</P>
      <P>Taiwan may not be able to withstand a 10-year depression, he
said, which is why he came up with the idea of having someone
establish a party that can bring the "mainstream" together, Liu said.</P>
      <P>When questioned whether the opposition alliance of the KMT, the
People First Party (PFP), and the New Party (NP) might be able to
play the role of this "mainstream party," Liu said that his
observations indicate that the alliance has been opposing the ruling
party for the sake of opposition.</P>
      <P>He added that the various parties have different political
opinions and would have "a limited effect," even if united under one
flag.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Secretary-General
Wu Nai-jen said that it is too early to speak of cooperating with
other parties because there is still one year between now and the
elections.</P>
      <P>However, he brushed aside reports that PFP Chairman James Soong
is willing to link up with former DPP chairmen Shih Ming-teh and Hsu
Hsin-liang for the elections, saying that the effects of such a move
on how well the DPP will do at the polls would be "not too big."</P>
      <P>Shih said later in the day that he does not rule out the
possibility of running in the legislative election with over 10
others as independent candidates.</P>
      <P>KMT Secretary-General Lin Fong-cheng agreed with Wu that it is
still too early to speak of joining forces with the PFP and the NP
for the elections. However, he added that he does not rule out the
possibility and that the three parties are "doing well together" at
the moment.</P>
      <P>The KMT is currently concentrating on internal reforms to bring
it closer to the "mainstream" public, he said, adding that Lee, the
former president and former KMT chairman, has also made it very clear
that he is not about to establish a new party.</P>
      <P>Chen Hung-chi, head of a KMT legislative subgroup, said that he
does not sense the kind of atmosphere that would allow for the
formation of such a party. On the other hand, he added that the KMT
and the PFP are "certain" to work together in next year's elections
when nominating candidates.</P>

      <P>Taiwan will lift a long-standing ban on
imports of used cars beginning Jan.1, 2001, the Board of Foreign
Trade announced Monday.</P>
      <P>The present regulations that allow only overseas Chinese and
Taiwanese studying abroad to bring their own used cars when they

      <P>The imported second-hand cars will be subject to the same rules
as apply to new cars entering the island.</P>
      <P>Although used caterpillar track vehicles, tractors, golf carts,
and steam turbines will also be allowed to be imported, the market for
used cars will bear the brunt of the new rules, which are designed to
prepare the island for its accession to the World Trade Organization.</P>
      <P>It is expected that local importers will introduce used
Japan-made cars from the United States to sidestep the quota on the
import of Japanese cars.</P>
      <P>Used Japanese sport cars, which are usually brought in under the
names of local students who studied in the United States, are hot

      <P>Under the new rules, business or non-business importers will

did before importing new cars, and the used cars will be subject to
the same regulations concerning safety, pollution and energy
efficiency as the new cars.</P>
      <P>However, the new measures do not cover vintage cars more than 20

order to upgrade government efficiency, accelerate reconstruction of
earthquake-stricken areas and improve the investment climate.</P>
      <P>The KMT legislative caucus agreed to transfer the letter to
President Chen on behalf of the representatives. Several female
KMT legislators also showed up to throw their support behind the
appeal.</P>
      <P>The representatives claimed that women's four basic human rights
-- to survival, freedom, property and work -- have been undermined or
faced unprecedented challenges since Chen took office in Taiwan's
first democratic transfer of power between different political
parties in May.</P>
      <P>Since Chen has often presented himself as a "human rights"
president, the delegates went on, he should shed his personal
ideology and adopt more realistic policies to revamp Taiwan's
slumping economy and regain public confidence in the country's future
prospects.</P>
      <P>The representatives further complained that since the
inauguration of Chen's administration, the suicide rate among women
and the number of domestic violence cases have risen substantially
due to the deteriorating local economic situation and surging
unemployment rates.</P>
      <P>Noting that local women's daily lives have been affected over the
past half-year, the delegates said if the Chen administration fails
to stop its "empty talks" and adopt effective measures to improve the
economic climate, they will stage a massive-scale demonstration.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN'S ECONOMY NEXT YEAR WILL LAG BEHIND THIS YEAR: ANALYST</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  18  (CNA)
(By David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The public's lack of confidence in the
government's economic and financial policies and a possible recession
of the U.S. economy next year will cause Taiwan's economy to lag far
behind this year, the head of a research institute said Monday.</P>
      <P>Liu Tai-ying, president of the Taiwan Research Institute (TRI),
made the remarks at a press conference on the outlook for Taiwan's
economy in 2001.</P>
      <P>He predicted Taiwan's economic growth rate in 2001 to be 5.53
percent, much lower than the 6.03 percent forecast earlier by the
Cabinet-level Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and
Statistics.</P>
      <P>Liu said that due to six consecutive hikes in interest rates, the
U.S. economy has slowed down. Some people have estimated that the
U.S. economic growth rate this year will drop sharply to 3.2 percent
from 5.3 percent, while others have predicted it will slip even
further to below 3 percent.</P>
      <P>No matter what figure is proved to be true, it will surely have
an adverse effect on Taiwan and other Asian nations, Liu said.</P>
      <P>Liu forecast that the growth rate of Taiwan's gross domestic
product (GDP) in the first quarter of next year will be 5.92 percent,
declining to 4.91 percent in the second quarter. However, he went on,
the growth rate in the third and fourth quarters will probably rally
to 5.40 percent and 5.89 percent, respectively, pushed by major
domestic investment projects.</P>
      <P>He further forecast that the growth rate of Taiwan's private
investments next year will fall to 5.12 percent, down significantly
from this year's 16.16 percent.</P>
      <P>He also predicted that the export growth rate next year will be
only 6.34 percent and that the import growth rate will be just 5.29
percent, while the private consumption growth rate will fall to 5.62
percent.</P>
      <P>Liu stressed that unless the government can take definite and
effective financial and economic measures, the outlook of Taiwan's
economy next year is not promising.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC TIES WITH MACEDONIA SECURE: ROC VICE FOREIGN MINISTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  18  (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Vice Foreign Minister
David Lee said Monday that his trip to Macedonia last week allowed
him to secure a "new understanding" of bilateral ties from the new
Cabinet members of the former Yugoslavian republic.</P>
      <P>Lee said that the few members of the Liberal Party (LP) who were
originally against the establishment of bilateral diplomatic ties
because of a "misunderstanding" on the depth and breadth of bilateral
relations now have a "completely new perspective" on the issue after
he explained to them that bilateral ties are built on more than just
an export-processing zone cooperative project.</P>
      <P>The Macedonian Cabinet underwent a reshuffle Nov. 30, with LP
stalwarts taking on the posts of deputy prime minister and foreign
minister. The LP replaced the Democratic Alternative (DA) party as
the third member of the Macedonian ruling coalition, which also
includes the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (VMRO)
and the Democratic Party of Albanians (DPA).</P>
      <P>Lee said that the establishment of ties between the two countries
was decided by the two governments, not merely with the agreement of
"a few Macedonian parties." There is "no problem," he added.</P>
      <P>Describing ties between the two countries as undergoing a
honeymoon stage, Lee said that the two would not likely be speaking
so soon of a "divorce." However, he added that newlyweds inevitably
have "small quarrels."</P>
      <P>Macedonia is one of two European diplomatic allies of the
Republic of China, the other being the Holy See.</P>

      <P>The Chunghwa Institute for Economic
Research forecast Monday that next year's parity between the new
Taiwan dollar and the U.S. dollar will be NT$34.10 and might drop to
NT$34.5 at its lowest point.</P>
      <P>Chen Yuan-pao, the institute's director of the forecast center
for economic prospects, said that the institute based its forecast on
the premise that the deficit of Taiwan's international balance of
payments will continue to expand and the inbound foreign capital
inflow will be unable to maintain the level of this year.</P>
      <P>Taiwan will be unable to maintain its favorable export situation
after both Taiwan and mainland China are admitted into the World
Trade Organization (WTO), further narrowing the trade surplus, he
went on.</P>
      <P>He forecast that the new Taiwan dollar will depreciate by 3 to 5
percentage points, a rate that the Central Bank of China would find
tolerable so long as the local stock market does not drop further,
capital and assets do not shrink further and a monetary crisis does
not occur next year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAINLAND `TORCH PROGRAM' DIRECTOR PROMOTES COOPERATION WITH TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  19  (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The director of mainland China's "Torch
Program" said here Tuesday that jointly developing new products and
technology with Taiwan will ensure a "win-win situation."</P>
      <P>Zhang Jingan, director of the China Torch High Tech Development
Center under the mainland Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology
(MOST), is currently in Taipei for a two-day seminar on cross-Taiwan
Strait industrial technology cooperation and development.</P>
      <P>The seminar is being jointly organized by Taiwan's Chinese
National Federation of Industries and a division of the mainland's
MOST International Cooperation Department that handles cooperation
and exchanges with Taiwan in the field of science and technology.</P>
      <P>Zhang told the press that the two sides of the Strait have "a lot
of space" for industrial cooperation. In the case of high tech
industrial development, he said that Taiwan has the technology, while
mainland China has the human talent and the market. Therefore, he
added, the two should work together to develop new products and
technology.</P>
      <P>Zhang's "torch center" is the brainchild of mainland China's
Minister of Science and Technology Zhu Lilan. The center is in charge
of establishing and supervising the 40-some high and new technology
industry development zones around the country and aims to nurture the
mainland's domestic technology research capabilities.</P>
      <P>After the two-day conference, Zhang's 39-member delegation of
government officials, industry representatives, and academic experts
is scheduled to visit the Institute for Information Industry, a
quasi-governmental organization that promotes Taiwan's information
industry and is charged with accelerating the country's national
computerization program.</P>
      <P>The delegation is also set to tour the Industrial Technology
Research Institute (ITRI), the largest of Taiwan's non-profit
research institutes. The ITRI serves primarily to develop industrial
technologies and transfer them to domestic private enterprises to
sharpen the competitive edge of Taiwan industry in the international
market.</P>
      <P>Zhang said that he is especially interested in seeing the
software and hardware development environment at Taiwan's Hsinchu
Science-based Industrial Park, a successful example of a
government-university-industry initiative that is home to such
prominent names as Acer and Mitec, both leading manufacturers of
personal computers.</P>
      <P>The park is also home to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing
Corp., a pioneer in the semiconductor foundry business; United
Micro-Electronics Corp. and TI-Acer, both leaders in the
microprocessor and DRAM/SRAM business; and Umax, a leading producer
of optical scanners and multimedia products.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CANADA CAUGHT BETWEEN U.S. AND RUSSIA OVER MISSILE DEFENSE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa, Dec. 18 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Canada on Monday found itself caught in the
middle of growing tension between Russia and the United States over
the issue of American plans to build a National Missile Defense
system.</P>
      <P>Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien and visiting Russian
President Vladimir Putin spent over five hours meeting behind closed
doors over the past two days, talking about issues regarding nuclear
weapons, trade, and the Arctic.</P>
      <P>At the end of their meeting, the two leaders signed an agreement
on nuclear stability, with both questioning a plan by U.S.
President-elect George W. Bush to create an NMD system.</P>
      <P>Putin argued that the American plan to set up the missile defense
shield would "damage international security," and he asked Canada to
join with other nations to oppose the project.</P>
      <P>Though both Putin and Chretien reaffirmed their support for the
long-standing anti-ballistic missile treaty, Chretien said it was
premature to discuss the NMD plan since it's still in the concept
stage.</P>
      <P>Any American system would need Canada's cooperation, and Chretien
admitted that being between the U.S. and Russia on this issue is not
a very comfortable position, telling Putin that "questions will be
raised by the Canadian government."</P>
      <P>"We're in a bit of geographical bind in a way because Russia is
on one side, and on the other side is the Americans. So we want to
consider all the consequences this program could have for Canada,"
Chretien told the media.</P>
      <P>Russia said if the U.S. goes ahead with the program, it will
destabilize world security. Now that it is no longer a world
superpower, Russia seems to be looking to Canada for a little
leverage with Washington, D.C.</P>
      <P>Canada could act as a mediator, Putin said at a joint press
meeting with Chretien.</P>
      <P>Putin appeared to have gained Chretien's cautious support in his
fight against Bush's plan for a nuclear defense system.</P>
      <P>It's uncertain how the new administration in Washington will
react to the new cooperation between Canada and Russia.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SELLING MORE ARMS TO TAIWAN IN AMERICA'S BEST INTEREST: EXPERT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Dec.  18  (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An American expert on defense and
foreign policy on Monday urged the new Bush administration to sell
more arms to Taiwan, stressing that "an effective Taiwanese deterrent
makes it less likely that the United States will ever be called on to
rescue Taiwan and therefore is definitely in America's best
interest."</P>
      <P>Ted Galen Carpenter, vice president for defense and foreign
policy studies at the Washington-based Cato Institute, wrote in an
Op-Ed article that as tensions continue to simmer between Communist
China and Taiwan, the Bush administration will come under increasing
pressure to provide Taiwan with a firm security guarantee.</P>
      <P>"That could be dangerous and put the United States directly at
risk. Instead, the United States should increase arms sales to Taiwan
and encourage other countries to do the same," noted the expert.</P>
      <P>Carpenter also called the Clinton administration's decision this
year on arms sales to Taiwan "timid," saying that it "plays into
Beijing's strategy to isolate, weaken, and ultimately strangle
Taiwan."</P>
      <P>He was referring to Washington's decision not to sell Taiwan the
centerpiece of its purchase request, the Arleigh Burke-class Aegis
destroyers, nor the diesel submarines and P-3 Orion patrol aircraft
the island asked to buy. The administration also decided to keep the
advanced AMRAAM medium-range air-to-air missiles in the United States
unless Taiwan needed them in response to an emergency.</P>
      <P>"If Taipei is to deter mainland China from using coercion on the
issue of reunification, Taiwan must be able to purchase modern
armaments, now and in the future," pointed out Carpenter.</P>
      <P>He did add that this does not mean that Washington should approve
every request, pointing out that Taipei's desire for diesel
submarines, for example, seems ill advised and a waste of money. He
said he is convinced that Taiwan's military would be better off
increasing the number of its P-3 aircraft for anti-submarine missions
in its next request order.</P>
      <P>Carpenter stressed, however, that U.S. officials should approve
most weapons systems Taiwan seeks and stop worrying about whether
such actions will annoy Beijing because, as far as mainland China is
concerned, any arms sale to Taiwan is unacceptable.</P>
      <P>"In its self interest, Washington should be more open to Taiwan's
arms requests. A well-armed Taiwan is better able to deter Beijing
from contemplating the use of force to achieve reunification.
Conversely, a Taiwan armed only with obsolete weaponry may prove an
irresistible temptation to hardliners in Beijing," concluded
Carpenter.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KINMEN, MATSU RESIDENTS START TO APPLY FOR TRAVEL TO M'LAND</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 19 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Bureau of Immigration started to accept
applications from residents of Taiwan's outlying islands of Kinmen
and Matsu for travel to mainland China Tuesday in anticipation of the
opening of the "mini three links" across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>In line with the Offshore Islands Development Act passed by the
Legislative Yuan earlier this year, the ROC government has decided to
open direct trade, mail, and shipping links between the islands of
Kinmen and Matsu and the mainland Chinese ports of Xiamen and Mawei
in Fujian province, the so-called "mini three links," effective Jan.
1, 2001.</P>
      <P>Under the regulations, those who have had their residence on
Kinmen or Matsu registered for more than six months can apply to
enter the mainland anytime after Jan. 1 by ship.</P>
      <P>The average citizen will be able to receive a multiple entry and
exit permit valid for one year, while government employees, teachers,
military servicemen, and police officers will be able to receive a
single entry and exit permit valid for six months.</P>
      <P>Mainland Chinese citizens who have a registered residence on the
mainland, and not necessarily only in Fujian province, can apply to
enter Kinmen or Matsu, both of which lie closer to the mainland than
to Taiwan proper.</P>
      <P>But regulations state that mainland citizens who want to enter
Kinmen or Matsu for business or academic activities, to visit
relatives, or to attend the funerals of family members must have
someone with residence status on Kinmen or Matsu apply on their
behalf.</P>
      <P>For individuals, the number of mainland Chinese citizens that
will be allowed to enter Kinmen per day will be between 17 and 100,
while the number allowed to enter Matsu per day will be between 3 and
20, depending on how many mainlanders are already present on the
islands on any given day. The mainlanders will be able to stay on the
outlying islands for a maximum of seven days per visit.</P>
      <P>According to group tour regulations, each group must have between
10 and 25 people. Those visiting Kinmen as part of a tour group will
be able to stay for a maximum of one night and two days, with the
daily maximum number of mainland Chinese group tourists set at 600.
Mainlanders visiting Matsu as part of a tour group will be able to
stay on the island for two nights and three days, with the daily
maximum number of mainland tour group visitors set at 40.</P>
      <P>While the Bureau of Immigration and its service branches in
Taichung, Kaohsiung, and Hualien have started to accept applications,
those on Kinmen and Matsu have only started to hand out application
forms and will begin processing applications from Thursday.</P>
      <P>Lee Tzeng-shou, who was the first person to receive an
application form, said that he has been waiting for this moment for
more than five decades.</P>
      <P>Lee said he obtained application forms for himself and his family
members and also some for his relatives who were unable to leave the
mainland over 50 years ago.</P>
      <P>He said that he plans to take the first ship, which is scheduled
to depart Jan. 1, to visit his relatives on the mainland.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP FAILS TO PUSH THROUGH 44-HOUR WORKWEEK AMENDMENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 19 (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Democratic Progressive Party legislators on
Tuesday failed to push through a 44-hour workweek amendment to the
new Labor Standards Law that is set to go into effect at the start of
January.</P>
      <P>Following the DPP administration's decision to increase the
number of labor work hours from 84 hours per two-week period to 44
hours per week, the DPP legislators were unable to pick up enough
votes against the opposition alliance among the Kuomintang, the
People First Party, and the New Party, which together hold a majority
in the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>The motion to amend the law failed by a vote of 77-61 with two
abstentions during the first reading and by a vote of 80-60 with two
abstentions during the second reading.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislative Whip Hsu Tien-tsai said after the votes were
tallied that his caucus will initiate a third attempt Friday. He
urged labor organizations to understand the necessity of increasing
the number of work hours due to the country's current economic
plight, adding that he is certain there are more lawmakers who are
supportive of the proposed amendment.</P>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung told reporters while inspecting the
foreign ministry that the 44-hour workweek plan is the "best policy"
that will create a win-win situation for both management and labor.</P>
      <P>He went on to say that the Cabinet will not only continue to
promote the amendment, but that it will also strive to persuade all
sectors -- including the opposition-majority in the Legislative Yuan
-- to support it because "there is no other way to go."</P>
      <P>Chang said that the industry might "pay an immense price" once
the law, which was passed in June, goes into effect on Jan. 1, adding
that the Cabinet does not wish to see Taiwan industry face the
"painful consequences."</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT CHEN SUPPORTIVE OF UMC'S INVESTMENT PROJECT IN SINGAPORE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 19 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Tuesday after
touring United Microelectronics Corp.'s plant in the Hsinchu
Science-based Industrial Park that he supports the major Taiwan
computer chip maker's investment project in Singapore.</P>
      <P>The president said that as long as domestic enterprises' outbound
investment strengthens the continued growth and extention of domestic
industry, the government will view it from a positive perspective and
support it.</P>
      <P>Chen said UMC's investment in the building of a US$3.6 billion
wafer plant, the largest single Taiwan investment in Singapore, will
serve as a reference for Taiwan on how Singapore attracts investors.</P>
      <P>UMC's announcement last week that it will form a new company with
German chip maker Infineon Technologies AG to build a 12-inch wafer
foundry plant has aroused heated debate in Taiwan on whether this
represents the beginning of the exodus of Taiwan's high-tech industry
or the natural expansion of a mature technology company.</P>
      <P>But UMC Chairman Robert H. C. Tsao, in a briefing to the
president, said that UMC will definitely keep its roots in Taiwan and
that its investment in Singapore will only be for the purpose of
gaining experience.</P>
      <P>The president lauded UMC's investment as representative of
domestic enterprises' ability to go multi-national, meaning that they
do not only have to invest in third world countries to make use of
cheap labor there.</P>
      <P>Chen stressed that through the UMC's investment in Singapore,
Taiwan will be able to learn how the Singaporean government has used
attractive offers and its high efficiency to introduce high-tech
industry, how it has solved water and electricity supply problems,
and how it has set environmental standards and implemented
environmental measures, all of which will serve as a useful reference
for the improvement of Taiwan's domestic investment environment.</P>
      <P>Chen continued by saying that a modern government should not try
to apply a too rigid approach to its top enterprises and turn them
into second or third rate enterprises by tying them down too much.</P>
      <P>The president said that he was gratified to see that UMC has
continued in recent years to pursue the upgrading of its technology
and the forming of international strategic alliances to expand its
business scale.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN'S 'POLITICAL REFORM MIRACLE' GIVES ISLAND ANOTHER EDGE: PM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  20  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Besides Taiwan's well-known economic
miracle, the miracle of its political reform is another element
giving the island a competitive edge in the international arena,
Premier Chang Chun-hsiung said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Unlike mainland China's political system, Taiwan's has legal
opposition parties -- a result of decades of struggle for political
reform, Chang said during a meeting at the Executive Yuan.</P>
      <P>"We are still in the up-grading process and we, the government,
are bracing ourselves for all varieties of challenges," Chang
stressed.</P>
      <P>Chang said he disagreed with recent allegations that while
mainland China is now focusing its efforts on economic development,
Taiwan is engaging in political struggle -- a situation opposite that
during the era of President Chiang Ching-kuo when Taiwan was in
full-gear developing its economy and mainland China was mired in
disastrous domestic political strife.</P>
      <P>He said the allegations are untrue as Taiwan has not only already
achieved an economic miracle, it is also creating a miracle in the
field of political reform, giving the island another major
competitive advantage in the international community.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, commenting on the Democratic Progressive Party
legislators' failure Tuesday to push through a 44-hour work-week
amendment to the New Labor Standards Law that is set to go into
effect Jan. 1, Chang insisted that a 44-hour work-week is the only
approach that is beneficial to both management and labor.</P>
      <P>Calling for support from members of the Legislative Yuan and from
the labor sector for the 44-hour work-week amendment, Chang noted
that the 84-hour per two-week work plan initiated by the opposition
Kuomintang will only have the effect of pushing more domestic
industries to relocate their operations abroad to avoid the
inhospitable investment climate at home.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC TROOPS CAPABLE OF DEFENDING NATIONAL SECURITY: MILITARY CHIEF</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  20  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China armed forces are
capable of defending national security, Chief of the General Staff
Tang Yao-ming said confidently Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Tang was responding to a U.S. Defense Department report that
conceded the existence of several "gaps" in its understanding of
Taiwan's and mainland China's military capacities and needs which
could affect the U.S. ability to comply with the Taiwan Relations
Act (TRA).</P>
      <P>Tang said the ROC military is certainly capable of safeguarding
Taiwan's security. "It's a matter beyond any doubt," he stressed
after reviewing an army training exercise, code-named the "Brave
Lions" drill, held at an army base in northern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The senior military officer further pointed out that as the
Taiwan Strait stability holds the key to Northeast Asian peace
and security, relations between the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait have been a common concern of the United States and Northeast
Asian countries.</P>
      <P>In his view, Tang said maintaining cross-strait military balance
is crucial to safeguarding Northeast Asian regional peace and
stability. "If any side of the Taiwan Strait does not have enough
defense capability, regional peace and security would be
threatened," he noted.</P>
      <P>Tang was originally scheduled to fly to the ROC-held frontline
island of Matsu to inspect its security measures in preparation for
the imminent opening of direct "mini three links" with
mainland China's Mawei port. As Matsu's Peikan airport was closed
Wednesday morning due to poor weather conditions, Tang canceled his
inspection tour and instead traveled to the Hukou military base
where an infantry battalion of the motorized brigade was conducting
an urban warfare training exercise.</P>
      <P>The U.S. Defense Department said Monday there were three key
"gaps" in Washington's ability to assess the potential for any future
conflict between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The Pentagon made the statements in an unclassified version of a
report to Congress on continuing U.S. implementation of the TRA, the
1979 law that requires the United States to supply Taiwan with
sufficient defensive weaponry.</P>
      <P>"The Department of Defense has dedicated significant resources
over the past two decades to monitoring the situation in the Taiwan
Strait," said the report, which noted that tension between
mainland China and Taiwan appeared to be low at the present time.</P>
      <P>It further said that Washington continued to press Beijing and
Taiwan to settle their differences peacefully. But the report
cautioned that while much was known about airplanes, warships and
other weaponry on both sides, "in general, three kinds of gaps stand
out" in information needed by Washington to more accurately assess
the situation:</P>
      <P>-- Details on how authorities in Beijing and Taiwan view their
military and political situations;</P>
      <P>-- Specifics on training, logistics, doctrine, command and
control, special operations and mine warfare in mainland China and
Taiwan;</P>
      <P>-- Information to predict how each side's military capabilities
will develop in the key areas of missiles and information warfare.</P>
      <P>"In some cases, we are unlikely ever to obtain exactly the
information we would want," the six-page report said. "If some
knowledge gaps cannot be corrected, it is at least advantageous to be
aware that they exist."</P>
      <P>In spelling out U.S. goals for the cross-strait issue, the
report stopped short of committing the U.S. to come to Taiwan's
defense if attacked.</P>
      <P>"The overarching U.S. goal is to avoid any use or threat of
force to resolve differences in the Taiwan Strait," it noted, adding
that mainland China must be persuaded against or deterred from
attacking or threatening attack, and if the attack comes, it must be
"unsuccessful."</P>
      <P>Finally, the report said, the Pentagon seeks to avoid in
peacetime the erosion of its capacity to assist Taiwan in the
future.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LEGISLATORS' PLANNED `TRIAL SAILING' TO MAINLAND ABORTED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  20  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The planned trial sailing by a group of
Taiwan legislators to the mainland Chinese port city of Xiamen prior
to the implementation of the so-called "mini three links" has been
aborted, sources from the Legislative Yuan said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The trial sailing plan was aborted because a notification by the
legislators to Beijing's intermediary body, the Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS), through Taipei's
counterpart, the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), was actually not
sent as planned on Tuesday as a result of Mainland Affairs Council
Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen "saying no" to sending the message, said
Kuomintang Legislator Chen Ken-teh.</P>
      <P>Chen, convenor of the Legislative Yuan's Transportation
Committee, said the notification was not sent out Tuesday because
Tsai ordered a stop to the move, consequently delaying the
preparatory period for the trial sailing and prompting the committee
to call a halt to the plan.</P>
      <P>Chen said Tsai will be invited to the Legislative Yuan soon to
make a special report on this concern as "she owes us an
explanation."</P>
      <P>Chen planned to lead a delegation from the Legislative Yuan
Transportation Committee and members of Taiwan's media on a sailing
from the ROC-controlled frontline island of Kinmen across the Taiwan
Strait to Xiamen on Dec. 28 to explore all varieties of possibilities
prior to the kicking-off of the "mini three links."</P>
      <P>As part of its efforts to help boost economic development on the
outlying islands of Kinmen and Matsu, the ROC government has decided
to allow direct trade, mail, and shipping links between the two
offshore islands and the mainland Chinese ports of Xiamen and Fuzhou
in Fujian province, commonly known as the "mini three links," from
Jan. 1, 2001.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, another similar Taiwan delegation, being sponsored by
Kuomintang Legislator Chen Ching-pao, a lawmaker from Kinmen, is
reportedly set to carry out its own trial sailing, also from Kinmen
to Xiamen, as scheduled on Dec. 28.</P>
      <P>It remains unclear whether the second group has already applied
for such a trial sailing through the ordinary process for such
matters, which includes an application to the ARATS via the SEF.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CPC TAKES OVER OIL BUSINESS ON KINMEN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kinmen, Dec. 20 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The soon-to-be privatized Chinese Petroleum
Corp. (CPC) has received authorization to take over the oil service
industry on the frontline island of Kinmen, ending five decades of
control by the Kinmen County Government.</P>
      <P>The transfer will mark another of the positive results of the
Republic of China's efforts to ease tensions across the Taiwan
Strait, which includes the impending kick-off of the "mini three
links," referring to direct trade, mail and shipping links between
ROC-controlled outlying islands of Kinmen and Matsu and mainland
China's port cities of Xiamen and Fuzhou, scheduled for Jan. 1, said
Kinmen Magistrate Chen Shui-tsai.</P>
      <P>Presiding over a ceremony marking the hand-over, Chen said owing
to the unique cross-strait circumstances, the Kinmen County
Government had been authorized to take charge of the oil industry and
services for nearly five decades on Kinmen, a frontline
anti-Communist China defense garrison until recently.</P>
      <P>With the kicking-off of the "mini three links" on Jan. 1, 2001,
Chen said demand for oil and petroleum products is expected to
increase by leaps and bounds in the Kinmen area.</P>
      <P>Also addressing the ceremony, Huang Chung-chuan, a CPC official
from Kaohsiung who will be in charge of the new CPC business on
Kinmen, said that although operations in the offshore area will be
much more difficult and complicated than those on Taiwan proper, the
company vows to provide the best possible services to consumers on
Kinmen, which still has some 10,000 military personnel.</P>
      <P>To ensure steady and sufficient supplies of oil and related
products, Huang said the CPC is planning to build an oil terminal in
Kinmen's Hsinhu District.</P>
      <P>Construction of the new oil terminal, a complex of six oil depots
and related facilities carrying a price tag of NT$200 million, is
expected to begin later in 2001 if all goes smoothly, he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SINGLE-DIGIT FIGURES EXPECTED FOR ROC'S DECEMBER EXPORT, IMPORT GROWTH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 20 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The growth in the value of Taiwan's exports
and imports for the month of December is only expected to be 7.5
percent and 2.0 percent respectively, the Ministry of Finance said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>MOF officials said the estimated figures represent the first time
that both exports and imports will only register single-digit monthly
growth since October 1999.</P>
      <P>The officials made the remarks after announcing that statistics
showed exports for the period Dec. 1 to Dec. 16 totaled US$6.73
billion and imports totaled US$5.99 billion, up 7.1 percent and 0.5
percent respectively.</P>
      <P>Taiwan registered a trade surplus of US$740 million for the first
half of December, up 1.3 times over the figure for the same period
the previous year, they added.</P>
      <P>The officials said that during the first half of December, the
rate of increase in integrated circuit exports was relatively large,
but exports of automatic data processors and component parts and
industrial textiles experienced a relatively large rate of decrease.</P>
      <P>The rate of increase in crude oil and sophisticated instrument
imports was relatively large for the same period, and imports of
electronic products and machinery experienced a relatively large rate
of decrease, the officials added.</P>
      <P>Affected by a global slowdown, Taiwan's economic development has
also slowed, and demand for its electronics and information products
has gradually shrunk.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a domestic economic slowdown and the depreciation of
the new Taiwan dollar has increased the cost of imports, leading to a
decrease to single-digit growth in imports in December.</P>
      <P>The officials also predicted that export growth for the whole
year will be 21.8 percent, while import growth will be 26.7 percent.</P>
      <P>Total exports for the year to Dec. 16 totaled US$142.12 billion,
while imports for the same period amounted to US$134.7 billion, up
22.5 percent and 27.7 percent respectively over those of the same
period the previous year.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taiwan's trade surplus for the year to Dec. 16 totaled
US$7.36 billion, down 29.8 percent over the figure for the same
period the year before.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT CHEN PITCHES FOR UPGRADING OF ROC-THAI RELATIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 20 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian
pitched for the upgrading of relations with Thailand Wednesday while
meeting with a Thai senatorial delegation.</P>
      <P>President Chen said the visit of the Thai senatorial mission
symbolizes the cordiality of relationship between the two countries.
Nevertheless, Chen said there is still ample room for the ROC and
Thailand to upgrade their exchanges and cooperation.</P>
      <P>Chen said he is hopeful that the Thai parliament can help push
its government to throw support behind the ROC's bids to become a
dialogue partner of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN) and a full member of the World Trade Organization (WTO) and
the World Health Organization (WHO).</P>
      <P>In view of ever-growing civilian and commercial exchanges
between the two countries, Chen went on, Thailand should also upgrade
the level of official contacts with the ROC and resume the annual
ministerial-level economic conference.</P>
      <P>"It is a must to enhance bilateral engagements, particularly
exchanges of visits by high-ranking government officials," Chen
said.</P>
      <P>Thailand has been reluctant to maintain official contacts with
the ROC since it switched diplomatic recognition from Taipei to
Beijing in 1975.</P>
      <P>President Chen said two-way trade between Taiwan and Thailand
has grown steadily and reached US$4.5 billion last year. In
addition, Chen said Taiwan is the largest employer of expatriate
Thai workers and the third largest foreign investor in
Thailand.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, Chen said, Thailand should forge closer
official contacts with the ROC for mutual benefits. "For one thing,
the two countries should resume the annual ministerial-level economic
conference which has bee suspended since 1991," he added.</P>
      <P>Chen further suggested that the existing bilateral labor meeting
be upgraded to the ministerial level to facilitate settlement of
certain migrant workers-related issues and improve services for
legal Thai workers in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>More than 141,000 Thai people are now working in Taiwan,
accounting for about 50 percent of total expatriate Thai laborers.
Chen said he is grateful for the contribution of migrant Thai
workers have made to Taiwan's infrastructure construction over past
years. Chen told the visiting Thai senators that local employers
are generally satisfied with Thai workers' diligence and
law-abiding spirit.</P>
      <P>The 10-member Thai delegation was headed by Sawai Prammanee,
chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Labor and Welfare.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CANADA ANNOUNCES MORATORIUM ON DEBT OWED BY POOREST COUNTRIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  Dec.  19  (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Canada announced a moratorium Tuesday on
the repayment of about C$700 million (US$455 million) in loans by
some of the world's poorest countries.</P>
      <P>Finance Minister Paul Martin's announcement puts Canada on the
leading edge of an international initiative to forgive all debt owed
by severely impoverished nations.</P>
      <P>The moratorium lets most of Canada's poorest debtors off the hook
on principal and interest payments. The debts will be forgiven when
the countries fulfill promised democratic and human-rights reforms.</P>
      <P>"Crippling debt burdens represent a formidable obstacle to the
poorest countries of the world," Martin said.</P>
      <P>"These nations must be given a sustainable path to enable them to
provide basic services such as health care and education to their
populations," he added.</P>
      <P>About 17 countries are on Canada's list of poor debtors. Eleven
of them will benefit from the moratorium, namely Benin, Bolivia,
Cameroon, Ethiopia, Ghana, Guyana, Honduras, Madagascar, Senegal,
Tanzania, and Zambia.</P>
      <P>Countries such as the Democratic Republic of Congo, Liberia,
Sudan, and the Ivory Coast still have too many human-rights problems
to enjoy Canada's "humanitarian generosity," said Martin. The
combined amount these countries owe Canada is about C$370 million
(US$243 million).</P>
      <P>"The countries that will be receiving the benefits of this
moratorium are countries that have indicated unequivocally that they
are prepared to put the money into health and education," said
Martin.</P>
      <P>He noted that the moratorium will be extended to the six excluded
countries when Canada becomes satisfied that they are prepared to
provide good government and spend the money on health and education.</P>
      <P>Canada's plan, which goes into effect Jan. 1, 2001, won't cost
the government much in terms of revenue as many of the world's
poorest countries have not been servicing their bilateral debts
anyway. Canada only collected about C$20 million in principal and
interest payments in 1999 from these countries, or about 68 percent
of what it was owed for that year.</P>
      <P>The initiative won praise from aid groups, with even the
conservative Canadian Taxpayers Federation voicing its support for
the policy, saying the financial impact on Canada will be negligible.</P>
      <P>"As an affluent country, we have a role to play in the community
of nations," said federation president Walter Robinson. The challenge
lies in ensuring the money is not invested in arms or "corporate
welfare," he added.</P>
      <P>Ensuring that recipients promote free-market reforms, property
rights, and democratic governance is the best way of offering a hand
up and breaking the cycle of welfare dependency, Robinson said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EXPERTS URGE BUSH TO WORK TO MAINTAIN PEACE IN TAIWAN STRAIT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Dec.  19  (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Two American China experts urged the
new Bush administration to work to maintain peace in the Taiwan
Straits and to make it clear to Beijing that continued deployment of
increasing numbers of short- and medium-range missiles across from
Taiwan make an American Theater Missile Defense response in the area
almost inevitable.</P>
      <P>David M. Lampton, director of the Nixon Center, and his assistant
director, Gregory May, wrote in a recently published report that the
United States, by maintaining a modest contingent of around 100,000
forward deployed troops, has managed to contribute to a stable
balance of power and peace in the Asia-Pacific region's powder kegs,
namely the Taiwan Straits and the Korean Peninsula.</P>
      <P>"This should continue to be the focus of U.S. government policy
in the region, though Washington needs to think creatively about how
to best maintain a stable balance in the years ahead," said the
report.</P>
      <P>Currently, the two experts pointed out, cross-strait tensions
"represent an unacceptably high risk of spiraling out of control.
Policy assessment is needed in Washington, and this should be among
the new administration's highest foreign policy priorities," they
wrote.</P>
      <P>They noted that mainland China's preoccupation with, and
"deterrence" posture toward, Taiwan is hampering its ability to
reassure neighbors in the Asia-Pacific of its peaceful intent.
Beijing's military buildup will undoubtedly shape the policies of
other Asia-Pacific actors, including the United States, "a fact
Beijing does not acknowledge."</P>
      <P>Beijing generally sees itself as reacting to the initiatives of
others, rather than others reacting to its moves. "China's gradual
buildup of short-range missiles to `deter' secessionist tendencies on
Taiwan is a classic example of how Beijing's self-conception of
reacting is feeding responses in Taiwan, in the United States, and
more broadly in East Asia," they wrote.</P>
      <P>While other countries in the region worry that Communist China
will become less respectful of the interests of others as its overall
economic and military strength continues to grow, Beijing worries
about what it views as the "hegemony" of the United States, they
noted.</P>
      <P>With this in mind, the two experts recommended that the new Bush
administration should do its best to involve Beijing in bilateral and
multilateral arms control efforts and that it must give important
weight to Communist China's reactions when it debates the issue of a
national missile defense system.</P>
      <P>"A missile defense deal with Russia that excludes China would be
damaging to stability," they pointed out.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NEW PARTY LEGISLATOR CRITICIZES LAVISH SPENDING ON EX-PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 20 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislator Elmer Feng of the opposition New
Party Wednesday criticized the government for lavishly spending money
to cover the expenses of previous President Lee Teng-hui.</P>
      <P>Saying the exorbitant price tag of NT$80 million (US$2.4 million)
a year set aside for Lee's expenses sets a "bad precedent in the
world," Feng stressed that he would do his best to cut related fees.</P>
      <P>Feng noted that the government has appropriated NT$30.16 million
to care for the previous president in its budget for 2001, including
NT$13.85 million for personnel expenses and 16.31 million for
overhead.</P>
      <P>Feng noted that the personnel expenses figure covers the retired
president's annual pay of NT$4.93 million, which works out to
NT$411,000 per month and not much less than the monthly salary of
NT$440,000 for current President Chen Shui-bian, saying that "this is
obviously not reasonable."</P>
      <P>In addition to the ex-president's annual salary, the personnel
fees figure also covers the pay for 12 staff members, totaling
NT$8.92 million. Feng said there are "obviously too many" staff
members for Lee, adding that most of them are government employees,
which he said sets "a bad example."</P>
      <P>Pointing out that the NT$16.31 million for overhead includes the
rent of NT$12.25 million per year for the ex-president's residence
and the monthly rent of NT$400,000 for Lee's office at the Taiwan
Research Institute, Feng vowed to do his best to cut the government's
spending on Lee's office rent at the think tank.</P>
      <P>Of the NT$30.16 million appropriated this year, the government
has already spent NT$20 million on decorating Lee's residence. Feng
noted that this amount and the salary and bonuses for Lee's 22
security guards will bring the total for the year to NT$70 million,
adding that if the NT$10 million expense for Lee's two limousines is
tacked on, government spending on the ex-president will be about
NT$80 million for the year.</P>
      <P>Feng questioned if it is reasonable to spend such a large amount
on a retired president when the general public is suffering from the
economic slump and people living in areas affected by the major
earthquake that struck Sep. 21 last year are still reeling from the
disastrous temblor.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Republic of China President Lee
Teng-hui has called for closer cooperation among the United States,
Japan and Taiwan in order to protect Asia from being dominated by a
hegemonic mainland China.</P>
      <P>Lee made the appeal in a recent interview in Taiwan with Japanese
cartoonist Yoshinori Kobayashi, which was printed in the latest issue
of SAPIO, a Japanese bi-weekly political magazine.</P>
      <P>In his talks with Kobayashi, Lee said he does not think that a
NATO-style security cooperation organization is likely to come into
being in Asia.</P>
      <P>"Therefore, it is important for individual Asian countries to
form separate cooperative ties to ensure their own national
security," Lee said, adding that Japan should be more confident of
playing a leading role in handling regional security affairs.</P>
      <P>Lee told Kobayashi, who has published a popular comic book on
Taiwan, that he foresees drastic changes in mainland China's internal
situation in the next eight years.</P>
      <P>"My observation is that mainland China will be plagued by
internal power struggles or a host of serious social and economic
problems in the next eight years or so and will thus undergo
significant changes from within," Lee noted.</P>
      <P>In his view, Lee went on, it is crucial for Taiwan to persevere
and withstand this transitional period. Lee said he has on many
occasions reminded incumbent ROC President Chen Shui-bian of this
issue.</P>
      <P>Lee, an outspoken critic of mainland China's diplomatic embargo
against Taiwan, further pointed out that the fundamental dispute
between Taipei and Beijing lies in their sovereign claims over
Taiwan. Against this backdrop, Lee said he thinks that Taiwan should
not co-host the 2008 Olympic Games with mainland China.</P>
      <P>Asked about his views on enthusiastic Taiwanese investment in the
mainland, Lee described such activities as "suicidal." According to
Lee, mainland China-bound Taiwanese investors, lured by its vast
market and cheap labor, are only seeking short-term profits.</P>
      <P>Lee said he is convinced that Taiwan-financed companies on the
mainland will certainly face many headaches soon, ranging from rising
labor costs and water/power shortages to environmental problems.</P>
      <P>Lee, who has a Ph.D. in agricultural economy from Cornell
University, said Taiwan companies must upgrade production technology
and management expertise if they are to survive global competition.
He suggested that Taiwan businesses strengthen cooperation with their
Japanese counterparts to maintain their market niches.</P>
      <P>Although Lee stepped down from the ROC presidency in May, the
Japanese government still refuses to allow Lee to visit as a private
citizen due mainly to Beijing's strong opposition. In his interview
with Kobayashi, Lee said he is confident that he will be able to
visit Japan in the not-too-distant future. He once studied at Japan's
Kyoto University.</P>
      <P>Kobayashi's comic book on Taiwan has sold more than 240,000
copies, mostly to women in their 20s. Publishing industry sources
said the comic book has helped attract many young Japanese women to
make sightseeing trips to Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>`MINI THREE LINKS' GESTURE OF GOOD FAITH TO MAINLAND CHINA: PREMIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  20  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung said Wednesday
that the scheduled opening of direct "mini three links" Jan. 1, 2001
is an important move designed to express the Republic of China's
sincerity and goodwill toward mainland China.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a weekly Cabinet meeting, Chang said that although
mainland China has so far given a lukewarm response to the imminent
opening of direct trade, transport and postal links between the
ROC-controlled islands of Kinmen and Matsu and selected mainland
Chinese ports -- the so-called "mini three links" -- it will mark a
very important step forward in relations across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>"Therefore, all relevant government agencies should cooperate
closely to ensure the success of the measure," Chang said, adding
that relevant government agencies should also step up a publicity
campaign to help local people understand the true ramifications of
the move.</P>
      <P>After several months of preparations, the ROC government formally
announced last week that it would allow a limited number of mainland
people to visit Kinmen and Matsu from mainland China's southeastern
province of Fujian on a trial basis for one year from the beginning
of the new year.</P>
      <P>The "open-door" decision also includes the easing of a
decades-old ban on direct trade, shipping and postal links between
Kinmen/Matsu and selected mainland ports -- Xiamen and Fuzhou in the
initial stage.</P>
      <P>Chang said the upcoming opening of the links is a prelude to
Taiwan's entry to the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the opening
of full-fledged direct cross-strait trade, transport and mail links,
also known as "the three direct links."</P>
      <P>By opening the "mini three links," Chang said, the ROC wants to
demonstrate to mainland China and the whole world that its commitment
to forging rapprochement with Beijing is not just lip service. "We
are always willing to take concrete steps to improve cross-strait
relations," he pledged.</P>
      <P>It remains unclear whether mainland China, which has not held any
talks with Taiwan on the planned opening, will go along with the
plan. According to press reports from the mainland, Beijing will
neither respond to nor block the opening of the "mini three links."</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC PRESIDENT: CROSS-STRAIT PEACE COMMON INTEREST OF ROC, JAPAN, U.S.</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 20 (CNA)
(By Edward Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian
said Wednesday that maintaining peace across the Taiwan Strait is in
the common interest of the ROC, Japan and the United States.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks as he received a a seven-member Japanese
parliamentary delegation and added that the Beijing regime expansion
of its military buildup and deployment of missiles affects not only
Taiwan but also Japan and the United States.</P>
      <P>He also claimed that Beijing accepts Japanese economic assistance
to pay for these missile deployments and the military expansion.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that Japanese parliamentary delegation was comprised
of younger members of the Lower House from the ruling Liberal
Democratic Party (LDP), the Conservative Party, the Kuomei Party and
opposition Democratic Party and expressed the hope that younger
parliamentarians of both Japan and Taiwan will strengthen exchanges
of visits so as to further cement relations.</P>
      <P>He went on to say that among the 18 Cabinet members reshuffled by
Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori, 11 ministers belong to the pro-Taipei
non-partisan "Japan-ROC Dietmens Council," while three others are
very friendly toward Taiwan, adding that the Cabinet reshuffle was of
very great significance to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen said that when the Japanese government reviews its foreign
aid program, attention should be paid to the Beijing government.
Although Japanese economic assistance to Beijing will certainly help
maintain the peace and stability of the Asian-Pacific region and
Beijing's efforts to develop its economy, which will help it carry
out its democratization and liberalization, the Beijing regime is
also using the aid to expand its military and deploy missiles.</P>
      <P>Lower House member Yuriko Koike, on behalf of the visiting
delegation, expressed gratitude to Chen for receiving them and also
expressed the hope that younger parliamentarians on both sides will
strengthen their exchanges to strengthen bilateral relations.</P>
      <P>Touching on cross-strait issues and economic development in
Taiwan, Chen said that Taiwan's economy is its lifeline and the
government under his leadership will try its best to meet any
challenge at home and abroad to carry out the established economic
development policy.</P>
      <P>He also said that the government will try to normalize economic
and trade relations with mainland China and is reviewing the "no
haste be patient" policy and the "three direct links" policy, as both
Taiwan and mainland China will soon be admitted into the World Trade

    <HEADLINE>ECONOMIST URGES LIMITATIONS  ON TRADE TIES WITH BEIJING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  20  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A locally well-known economist told
President Chen Shui-bian Wednesday that the government should curb
Taiwan's commercial ties with mainland China for the sake of the
island's security.</P>
      <P>Contrary to local businessmen clamoring for a relaxation of the
government's long-standing limitations on Taiwan's trade links with
mainland China, Wu Rong-i, president of the non-profit Taiwan
Institute of Economic Research, urged President Chen Shui-bian to
impose "necessary" limitations on trade as well as on movement of
capital and personnel across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Noting that the government has earmarked NT$250 billion
(US$7.57 billion) for next year's defense budget because of Beijing's
refusal to renounce the threat of force against Taiwan, Wu said it is
"evident" that Taiwan should refrain from boosting Beijing's national
strength by helping its economic development.</P>
      <P>The present "no haste, be patient" policy which allows
businessmen to invest in mainland China as long as the funds do not
come directly from Taiwan and do not jeopardize the island's
financial stability and national security, is the last resort of the
government, Wu argued.</P>
      <P>He conceded, however, that some non-technology industries on the
island will perish without relocating to mainland China because of
Taiwan's high labor costs, but argued that huge investment in
mainland China, or some "special industry" that would erode the
island's competitiveness against the mainland, should be prohibited.</P>
      <P>Wu's views run counter to the calls from the island's low-tech
sector, which has difficulty raising money because of the plummeting
of its stock prices and is eager to relocate to the mainland to tap
the cheap labor market there.</P>
      <P>Wu said his institute has three recommendations for the
president, namely:</P>
      <P>-- revamping or scrapping the outdated regulations and speeding
up the development of the service industry;</P>
      <P>-- pushing ahead with knowledge-based economy in an innovative
way and supporting young businessmen's ventures with a healthy
capital market and tax breaks; and</P>
      <P>-- improving the country's infrastructure and developing
islandwide broad-brand and fixed-line networks.</P>
      <P>Citing the deregulation of the telecommunication in 1996 as an
example, Wu said Taiwan now has more than 15 million mobile
subscribers, among the highest concentration in the world in light of
its population, thanks to the opening of the telecommunication market
to private operators in 1998.</P>
      <P>The economist refused to comment on Wednesday's plummet of the
Taipei stock market, which saw its benchmark index sink below the
psychological mark of 5,000 points.</P>
      <P>"As a member of the national stabilization fund" set up to boost
the sapping stock prices, Wu said he is not in a position to make any
public comment on the matter.</P>
      <P>He also defended Chen's detachment from the tumbling stock
market, saying that the up and down of stock prices is none of the
president's business.</P>
      <P>As to the value of the new Taiwan dollar, Wu said he thinks the
local currency's decline against the greenback will turn around soon,
given the slowdown in the U.S. economy.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NEW ANTI-TANK MISSILES COMMISSIONED INTO ARMY SERVICE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taoyuan,  Dec.  20  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China Army's newly
acquired anti-tank weapon -- TOW-2A missiles -- came into the
limelight for the first time Wednesday when they were used on the
second day of a two-day military training exercise.</P>
      <P>Military sources said the U.S.-made TOW-2A missiles have high
mobility, as they can either be installed on mobile missile launchers
or in static positions. Equipped with an infrared tracking device,
TOW-2A missiles, which are now mounted on the Army's mobile M113
missile launchers, have an extremely high accuracy rate.</P>
      <P>Army officers said the deployment of the new missiles is part of
the grass-roots army units' current campaign to upgrade their
equipment and beef up their firepower in line with the ROC's military
build-up goal of establishing an elite deterrent force in the face of
mainland China's persistent military threat.</P>
      <P>The TOW-2A missiles have replaced the aging 106 mm and 75 mm
howitzers previously used by the anti-tank army units, military
sources said.</P>
      <P>Army officials said the TOW-2A missiles have been assigned to the
anti-armored vehicle battalions under the army's motorized brigades.
Each battalion now has 12 M113 TOW missile launchers, each of which
can accommodate 10 missiles at a time.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, army officers said the army is also seeking to
purchase French-made APILAS short-range TOW anti-tank missiles. "The
new procurement plan is approaching maturity," said an army official,
who preferred anonymity.</P>
      <P>In an effort to demonstrate the combat capability of its newly
formed combined services brigades, the army launched a two-day
training exercise Tuesday at an army base in northern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The "Brave Lions" training drill was carried out by the 269
motorized brigade, one of the toughest of its kind in the army. The
exercise was based on a scenario that Taiwan was under attack by
mainland China.</P>
      <P>The second day of the training drill involved a simulation of
nighttime and pre-dawn urban warfare. The "Brave Lions" exercise also
marked the first time that a regular training exercise of this kind
was open to the press.</P>

re-registering their membership between September and December.</P>

      <P>Chou A-ting, director-general of the CBC's Foreign Exchange

      <P>The exchange rate, he said, depends on the supply and demand for

    <HEADLINE>ROC EXPORTS TO U.S. HIT SINGLE-MONTH RECORD HIGH IN OCTOBER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Dec.  20 (CNA)
(By Herman Pan and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's exports to the United States
amounted to US$3.78 billion in October, marking the sixth
single-month record high in a row, sources from the U.S. Department
of Commerce reported Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The October figure represented a whopping 26.2 percent increase
over that of the same month the previous year and was mainly the
result of the considerable depreciation in the value of the New
Taiwan dollar against the greenback, according to foreign trade
experts in Washington.</P>
      <P>Taiwan exported US$33.95 billion worth of products to the United
States in the first 10 months of this year, registering an annual
growth rate of 17.95 percent, according to the DOC tallies.</P>
      <P>Based on the Jan.-Oct. performance, Taiwan's exports to the
United States are expected to exceed the mark of US$40 billion for
the first time ever this year, the foreign trade experts said.
Taiwan's exports to the United States totaled US$35.19 billion in
1999.</P>
      <P>According to the DOC tallies, Taiwan is currently the seventh
largest source of imports to the United States. It is also the United
States' seventh largest export market and its sixth largest source of
trade deficit.</P>
      <P>Cumulatively, two-way trade between Taiwan and the United States
was US$54.66 billion in the first 10 months of 2000, up an impressive
23.2 percent over the figure for the same period in the previous
year.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is presently the United States' eighth largest trading
partner, behind Canada, Mexico, Japan, mainland China, Germany,
Britain, and South Korea, in that order.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ITRI DEVELOPS WORLD'S FASTEST DNA SEARCH AND COMPARISON SOFTWARE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  21 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's non-profit Industrial Technology
Research Institute (ITRI) announced Thursday the development of a
commercial software package allowing rapid genomic DNA searches and
comparisons.</P>
      <P>The software, dubbed Fast Local Alignment for Gigabases (FLAG),
is being boasted as the fastest of its kind in the world. It consists
of a series of bioinformatics software packages which all employ the
novel algorithm allowing very rapid paired local alignment, said Lee
Chung-hsi, director of ITRI's Biomedical Engineering Center.</P>
      <P>Noting that the ultimate goal of genetic research is to find the
connections between genes and diseases and to research and develop
new medicines and cures for the diseases, Lee said FLAG, using
bioinformatics techniques, offers a helpful commercially-applicable
software package making quick genomic DNA comparison and searches
easy.</P>
      <P>According to Adam Yao, FLAG project manager, l-FLAG and s-FLAG
are two software packages that allow for long sequence comparisons at
a rapid speed, requiring only 21 minutes to compare C. elegans
chromosomes 1 and 3 on a PC workstation.</P>
      <P>Yao said FLAG may run faster than BLAST, a similar version
developed earlier in the United States, when a query sequence is over
2000 bases. FLAG also tends to find more matches with medium
similarity (50-75 percent) than BLAST, Yao said.</P>
      <P>Yao said he and his 15-member project team are preparing FLAG for
beta testing. "We welcome all interested users, particularly those
who tend to perform large-scale sequence alignments, to try out this
software," he noted.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN SHOULD INVEST MORE FOR FUTURE: NOBEL LAUREATE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Tainan,  Taiwan,  Dec.  21  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan should invest more for
future and should carve out a way and a direction for itself instead
of just following in the footsteps of Western countries, Academia
Sinica President Lee Yuan-tseh urged Thursday.</P>
      <P>Lee, a co-winner of the 1986 Nobel Prize in chemistry, made the
remarks while attending a ground-breaking ceremony for a
new production facility of Silicon Integrated Systems Corp. in the
Tainan Science-based Industrial Park in southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Noting that continued investment is key to sustain a country's
development, Lee said Taiwan must spend more on
scientific/technological development, education and manpower
cultivation, in addition to investing in traditional and high-tech
industries.</P>
      <P>In his view, Lee went on, research and development (R&amp;D) will
determine a country's competitiveness in the 21st century,
particularly in biotechnology and genetic study which will become
a main battlefield.' "Taiwan must brace itself for ever more
intensive competition in the biotech field in the new century,"
he noted.</P>
      <P>Through strenuous efforts over past five decades, Lee
said, Taiwan has managed to lay a solid foundation for future
development.</P>
      <P>"We should not forget our own strength while reviewing our past
developments. We should also avoid blindly following the path of
Western countries and should find out our own way and direction to
maintain our market niches," the respected scholar said.</P>
      <P>Silicon Integrated Systems Corp. (SISC), headquartered in the
Hsinchu Science-based Industrial Park in northern Taiwan, became the
27th company to build a factory in the Tainan industrial park. It
will invest an estimated NT$50 billion for building the new wafer
production facility. The government has so far approved applications
by 50 firms for establishing plants in the Tainan high-tech park.</P>

    <HEADLINE>VICE PRESIDENT FILES LIBEL SUIT AGAINST MAGAZINE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  21  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu filed a libel
suit against a local magazine Thursday after mediation efforts to end
a dispute between the two sides failed.</P>
      <P>Tsai Ming-hua, spokeswoman of the vice presidential office, said
Lu is seeking to clear her name and gain a public apology from The
Journalist by filing the civil lawsuit against the magazine.</P>
      <P>Tsai made the remarks after a legal team, comprised of eight
lawyers from the Taiwan Bar Association, announced that its mission
had failed after days of mediation efforts.</P>
      <P>Tsai said that what Lu wants is clear, namely to have the entire
truth be revealed before she considers talking about reconciliation.
In other words, the vice president wants the magazine to present the
alleged tape of her spreading the rumor of an alleged extramarital
affair between President Chen Shui-bian and one of his female aides
or else publish a public apology to clear Lu's name.</P>
      <P>Lu's own legal team had earlier said that a careful examination
of the vice president's residential telephone logs from Nov. 1-12
shows she did not call up any members of the media on Nov. 3 after 7
p.m. or at any other time to initiate the rumor.</P>
      <P>In its Nov. 18 issue, the magazine accused Lu of contacting a
"senior media person" to inform them of the alleged affair.</P>
      <P>The vice president's legal team accused the magazine of showing
"real malice" by claiming "without the slightest evidence" that Lu
wanted to use the alleged presidential scandal to "finish off" the
president and "flow with the momentum to scale new heights."</P>
      <P>Tsai stressed that the magazine's position of not apologizing to
the vice president and only offering to run a statement by Lu on the
matter in the magazine is unacceptable.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, The Journalist issued a statement that it regretted
the breakdown in mediation efforts, saying that it would now actively
prepare for all legal proceedings.</P>
      <P>Chu Sheng-chun, president of the Taiwan Bar Association, said
Thursday on behalf of the mediation team that it tried to mediate
between the two sides between Dec. 15 and Dec. 20 based on the
principles of "sincerity, efficiency, and privacy."</P>
      <P>Chu said that the team hoped that the whole thing would end
peacefully and that both human rights and press freedom would be
preserved unharmed.</P>
      <P>But as the two sides continued to insist on their respective
positions, the team had to announce with regret that the mediation
mission had failed.</P>
      <P>Lu had earlier set a dateline of Dec. 10 for the magazine to
publish a public apology or face legal action, but she delayed the
action to give the mediation team a chance to step in and try to
resolve the dispute.</P>
      <P>Wang Chien-chuang, president of The Journalist, has said that the
magazine will stand by its report, noting that there is "sufficient
reason" to believe in the accuracy of the report and that the fact
that his magazine "went to great pains to reasonably verify the
facts" shows there was never any malicious intent to defame anyone.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taoyuan,  Dec. 21 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The three Singapore Airlines (SIA) pilots
who have been detained since the crash of SIA Flight SQ006 that
killed 83 of the 179 people aboard on the evening of Oct. 31 were
freed Thursday by the Taoyuan Prosecutor's Office.</P>
      <P>Prosecutor Huang Mo-hsin said the detention of the three pilots
of the SIA jumbo jet that crashed during take-off at Chiang Kai-shek
International Airport in stormy weather has been suspended and the
restriction on their leaving Taiwan has been lifted.</P>
      <P>The pilots -- flight commander Capt. Foong Chee Kong, 41, a
Malaysian, and Singaporean co-pilots Latif Cyrano, 36, and Ng Kheng
Leng, 38 -- are expected to return to Singapore later on Thursday or
Friday.</P>
      <P>They were freed after officials from SIA and the Singapore Trade
Office in Taipei who were given joint custody of the trio last week
by Taoyuan prosecutors gave bonds obligating them to produce the
three men at any time that they are summoned.</P>
      <P>The pilots were originally expected to go home last week after
officials from the Singapore Trade Office in Taipei signed court
documents guaranteeing they would return to Taipei when they are
needed for the crash investigation.</P>
      <P>However, the Taoyuan prosecutors added a requirement last Friday
that Singapore Airlines should also be responsible for the return of
the three pilots when they are summoned.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors declined to say whether their decision to impose
additional conditions for the release was related to the pilots'
absence from a flight simulation designed to help determine the cause
of the accident.</P>
      <P>At the request of prosecutors, Singapore Airlines arranged last
Thursday for a cargo plane similar to the ill-fated Boeing 747
passenger plane that crashed to conduct a simulated flight to retrace
the path of SIA Flight SQ006.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors said they hoped to gain a better understanding of the
crash via the simulation in order to determine whether the accident
was caused by pilot error, misleading control tower instructions, bad
weather, or other reasons.</P>

southern province of Fujian, are scheduled to kick off on Jan. 1,
Chang noted.</P>
      <P>Chang added that the implementation of the "mini three links"
will not only serve as a peace initiative toward Beijing, but will
also help promote economic development in the ROC's offshore
counties.</P>
      <P>Chang noted, however, that after the opening of the links,
related ROC agencies will be highly vigilant against irregularities,
such as prohibited shipping between mainland Chinese ports and Taiwan
proper.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, he said, the Executive Yuan is also working on plans
paving the way for the implementation of the more significant direct
trade, post, and transportation links between Taiwan proper and
mainland China, better known as the "big three direct links," in
order to cope with Taiwan and mainland China's expected entry into
the World Trade Organization and the eventual reconciliation between
the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING'S BATTLE AGAINST CORRUPTION FAR FROM OVER: VOA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Dec.  21 (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Despite some official declarations of
success in Communist China's iron fist crackdown on graft, the battle
against corruption is far from over, with some believing that
corruption could threaten the very survival of the Communist Party,
reported the Voice of America radio station Thursday.</P>
      <P>The VOA, which expresses U.S. government policies, pointed out
that with Beijing's entry into the World Trade Organization just
around the corner and with the resulting faster pace of growth in the
mainland's economy, Communist Chinese officials will have even more
opportunities to misuse public funds.</P>
      <P>In September, the VOA said, hundreds of thousands of mainland
Chinese viewers watched Cheng Kejie, a former vice chairman of the
nation's parliament, being sentenced to death for taking millions of
dollars in bribes. He became the highest level Communist Chinese
official ever put to death for corruption.</P>
      <P>Jean-Pierre Cabestan, director of the Hong Kong-based French
Center for Research on Contemporary China, noted that Communist
Chinese leaders fear corruption is eating away at popular support for
Communist rule and are therefore anxious to show the public that they
are serious about wiping it out.</P>
      <P>In the first eight months of this year alone, Communist China
prosecuted more than 23,000 criminal corruption cases. And in
November, it sentenced to death 14 people, including some senior
officials, for their role in the biggest smuggling and payoff scandal
in Communist Chinese history.</P>
      <P>More officials are expected to be ensnared in the Fujian
smuggling scandal, but Cabestan said Communist Chinese leaders are
debating who to sacrifice and who to save. For example, Beijing's
Communist Party chief Jia Qingling is said to have been involved in
the scandal when he was the top leader in Fujian province at the time
when most of the smuggling occurred. Jia, however, remains in power,
with many feeling it is due to the fact that he is a close ally of
President Jiang Zemin.</P>
      <P>The VOA said that because so many senior officials have been
linked to graft scandals, the Beijing leadership's crackdown on
corruption is a double-edged sword. The more senior officials that
are publicly prosecuted, the more people begin to question the
legitimacy of the Communist Party itself, it pointed out.</P>
      <P>Many mainland Chinese citizens now believe that those most
responsible for corruption have remained unscathed by the crackdown,
saying the Beijing regime is only going after minor figures and
sparing people at the top, reported the VOA.</P>
      <P>Ms. He Qinglian, an economist and outspoken critic of corruption,
told the VOA that the government's crackdown fails to attack the root
of the problem. She was demoted from her position as newspaper editor
because of her vocal stance on corruption, she said, adding that the
question is not who in mainland China is corrupt, but who is not
corrupt.</P>
      <P>She stressed that many countries do not need to resort to
executions to cure graft and that the one-party system leads
naturally to corruption because those in power are not subject to any
independent supervision. She said she believes the only way to cure
the problem is to allow for the formation of political parties
besides the Communist Party. She also said the news media requires
more freedom to expose wrongdoing.</P>
      <P>But the VOA said Communist China's leaders are deeply concerned
that any loosening of their tight grip on power would lead to a
disintegration of the Communist Party and even of the state, just as
the Soviet Union collapsed ten years ago.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FOREIGN, OVERSEAS CHINESE INVESTMENTS IN TAIWAN POST RECORD HIGH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  22 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The total value of fresh investments made
in Taiwan by foreign nationals and overseas Chinese between January
and November of this year hit a record high of US$6.853 billion, up a
whopping 92.66 percent over the year-earlier level, the Ministry of
Economic Affairs reported Friday.</P>
      <P>Officials from the MOEA's Investment Commission attributed the
remarkable increase mainly to surging overseas investments in
Taiwan's telecommunications industry, including its mobile phone
industry, after the government liberalized the up-and-coming industry
early this year.</P>
      <P>In November alone, foreign nationals and overseas Chinese
channeled US$794.24 million into Taiwan for 69 investment projects,
marking a noticeable growth of 69 percent over the total for the same
month in 1999.</P>
      <P>Of the total amount of fresh foreign and overseas Chinese
investment from January to November, 30.29 percent went into Taiwan's
financial and insurance industries and 17.29 percent was put into the
telecommunications and related services industry, the officials said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taiwan companies remitted some US$2.3 billion to
mainland China in the first 11 months of this year for various
investment projects, mainly electronics and electrical appliance
manufacturing.</P>
      <P>The Jan.-Nov. mainland-bound investment marked a staggering
increase of 93 percent over that of the corresponding period the
previous year, the officials noted.</P>
      <P>They said they believe the whopping increase in Taiwan's
mainland-bound investment is the result of mainland China's expected
entry into the World Trade Organization and the resulting jostling
for position by Taiwan and foreign companies in attaining a share of
the promising mainland markets.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the officials noted, Taiwan's out-bound investment to
overseas areas beyond mainland China grew by a relatively slower pace
of 23 percent to total US$3.765 billion for the Jan.-Nov. period.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER CHANG TO VISIT KINMEN TUESDAY FOR 'MINI THREE LINKS'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  22  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung will visit the
frontline island of Kinmen Tuesday to inspect preparations for the
impending opening of the direct "mini three links" with selected
mainland Chinese ports, Cabinet sources said Friday.</P>
      <P>According to the sources, Premier Chang will attend a seminar on
issues related to the "mini three links" to be held at the Kinmen
Defense Headquarters and officiate at the inaugural ceremony for a
Cabinet-level "mini three links" coordination center during his
inspection tour.</P>
      <P>Chang will also inspect new facilities at the Liaolo port, which
will be opened for direct shipping links with mainland China's port
city of Xiamen as part of the much-anticipated opening of "mini three
links" on Jan. 1, 2001.</P>
      <P>The "mini three links" refer to direct trade, mail, and shipping
links between the Republic of China's defense outposts of
Kinmen/Matsu and mainland China's Xiamen and Fuzhou, both in the
southeastern province of Fujian which lies opposite Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In a briefing to a group of members of the watchdog Control
Yuan, Premier Chan said the opening of the "mini three links" is
part of the government efforts to show sincerity and goodwill toward
mainland China.</P>
      <P>Chang said he is hopeful that the "mini three links" kick off
smoothly as scheduled to help forge rapprochement across the Taiwan
Strait and to help boost economic development in the ROC's two
offshore islands, which lie far closer to the mainland than to
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In preparation for the opening of "mini three links," the
Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC) conducted a
rehearsal of immigration and customs clearance services at the newly
refurbished passenger service center at Kinmen's Liaolo port Friday
morning.</P>
      <P>Wu Rong-quey, director of the MOTC's Navigation and Aviation
Department, presided over the rehearsal, which was participated by
staff members from the MOTC and many other relevant government
agencies, including the Kinmen county Government's harbor division,
the Bureau of Immigration under the Ministry of the Interior, the
Kaohsiung Customs Office under the Ministry of Finance, the National
Coast Guard Administration, the Center for Disease Control under the
Department of Health, the Plant and Animal Inspection and Quarantine
Bureau and the National Bureau of Standards.</P>
      <P>The rehearsal involved a simulation of 200 passengers proceeding
with immigration and luggage inspection under the guidance of
government staff members in preparation for a direct voyage from
Kinmen to Xiamen. Many Kinmen residents participating in the
rehearsal as "passengers" said they have long expected direct links
with the mainland. "It's a dream come true," said a resident.</P>
      <P>Pao Cheng-kang, the chief secretary of the Mainland Affairs
Council, which charts Taiwan's policy toward the mainland, and
opposition Kuomintang Legislator Chen Ching-pao, who represents the
Kinmen constituency, showed up to observe the rehearsal.</P>
      <P>Legislator Chen said he has applied for a trial sail from Kinmen
directly to Xiamen on Dec. 28 to test whether the new shipping route
is safe. "If mainland authority approves the plan, we'll set sail
from Liaolo port as scheduled," he noted.</P>

    <HEADLINE>JUSTICES TO MAKE DECISION ON NUCLEAR PLANT BEFORE LUNAR NEW YEAR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  22 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council of Grand Justices is expected
to provide an explanation before the Lunar New Year, after completing
review of the legality of the Executive Yuan's decision to scrap the
island's fourth nuclear power plant.</P>
      <P>At the request of the Executive Yuan, which holds an anti-nuclear
position, the Council of Grand justices began a closed-door review of
the case Thursday.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan, which on Oct. 25 decided to halt the
construction of the fourth nuclear plant, a project started by the
former Kuomintang government in 1994 and already 30 percent finished,
turned to the Council of Grand Justices for endorsement of its stance
after a bitter quarrel with the opposition parties.</P>
      <P>On Friday, members of the Council of Grand Justices said they
will convene no more debating sessions on the issue and decided to
close the case before the Lunar New Year, which falls on Jan. 23 this
year.</P>
      <P>Both the Executive Yuan and the Legislative Yuan, which opposes
the abolishment, sent representatives to make their cases before the
14 grand justices who presided over Thursday's review.</P>
      <P>In addition, officials from the National Audit Office under the
Control Yuan, the supreme watchdog of the government's execution of
budget, and Shi Shih-chi, chairman of Taiwan Power Company, builder
and operator of the fourth nuclear plant, were also present at the
review held at the Judicial Yuan.</P>
      <P>Although the review is designed to convince the grand justices
that the dispute is a legal rather than a political issue and falls
within their authority, both the Executive Yuan and the Legislative
Yuan voiced their reasons behind their cases and blamed the other
side for sparking the controversy by misinterpreting the law.</P>
      <P>Enraged by the administration's decision to scrap the project,
legislators from the opposition Kuomintang, New Party and People
First Party (PFP) asked the Control Yuan Nov. 7 to initiate an
investigation into Premier Chang Chun-hsiung for possible
impeachment, and even threatened to force a vote to recall President
Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>On Friday, PFP Legislator Chou Shi-wei said the Executive Yuan's
unilateral decision to scrap the nuclear power plant is
unconstitutional because the budget for the plant was passed by the
Legislative Yuan before 1994.</P>
      <P>New Party Legislator Ying Chih-hung said the legislators have the
better chance of winning the battle because the Executive Yuan's
points of views are "full of holes."</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, representatives of the Executive Yuan at Thursday's
review argued that even though the budget cleared the legislative
floor, it is not a binding bill and the government is free to opt out
of carrying out a budget which it considers no longer appropriate.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KINMEN, MATSU TIGHTEN SECURITY AHEAD OF OPENING OF `MINI THREE LINKS'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  22  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) said
Friday it has asked the National Police Administration (NPA) to
tighten security on the frontline islands of Kinmen and Matsu in
preparation for the imminent opening of direct "mini three links."</P>
      <P>In line with the Offshore Islands Development Act passed by the
Legislative Yuan earlier this year, the government has decided to
open direct trade, mail, and shipping links -- better known as the
"mini three links" -- between the islands of Kinmen and Matsu and the
mainland Chinese ports of Xiamen and Fuzhou, effective Jan. 1, 2001.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a seminar on the "mini three links," MAC Vice
Chairman John C.C. Teng said security issues are the Republic of
China government's top concern in opening direct commercial, civilian
and transport links with the mainland.</P>
      <P>Amid reports that some mainland people had sneaked onto Kinmen to
steal a large amount of jewels in recent days, Teng said the MAC has
pushed the NPA to deploy more police officers on Kinmen and Matsu,
both of which lie closer to the mainland than to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In addition to increasing the police force in the ROC's two
defense outposts, Teng went on, the NPA has also been instructed to
install advanced security facilities and hone an effective
coordination mechanism to ensure safety and good public order in
Kinmen and Matsu after the opening of the "mini three links."</P>
      <P>According to the MAC-drafted "mini three links" regulations,
those who have had their residence on Kinmen or Matsu registered for
more than six months can apply to enter the mainland directly after
Jan. 1 by ship. Meanwhile, a limited number of mainland Chinese
citizens who have a registered residence on the mainland, and not
necessarily only in Fujian Province, can apply to enter Kinmen or
Matsu brief visits.</P>
      <P>As mainland China has refused to resume dialogue with Taiwan,
Teng said the initial enforcement of the "mini three links" plan will
focus on legalizing the small-time trade between fishermen on both
sides of the Taiwan Strait that has been going on illegally for
decades, and on activities that Taiwan can unilaterally carry out.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, Teng said, transshipment services are not
included in the first-stage enforcement of the "mini three links."
"This means that without prior government assent, mainland
merchandise imported into Kinmen and Matsu is banned from
transshipment to Taiwan proper, while Taiwan goods should also not be
shipped directly to the mainland via Kinmen and Matsu," Teng
explained.</P>
      <P>To avert such illegal transshipments and smuggling, Teng said,
the government has set up checkpoints at Kinmen's and Matsu's
airports, harbors and post offices. Moreover, he added, the National
Coast Guard Administration will intensify patrols in all the
surrounding areas to safeguard security in the two offshore islands
and thwart any attempts to smuggle goods and humans into Taiwan
proper.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Ministry of Transportation and Communications
(MOTC)-drafted regulations governing direct Kinmen-Xiamen and
Matsu-Fuzhou shipping services will take effect Dec. 25, when the
MOTC will start to accept applications from local and mainalnd
shipping firms to operate cargo/passenger transport services on the
two new routes. Maiden voyages on the two new routes will kick off
Jan. 1.</P>
      <P>The MOTC conducted a rehearsal of immigration and customs
clearance services at Kinmen's Liaolo Port Friday, while Premier
Chang Chun-hsiung is scheduled to visit Kinmen to see for himself the
preparations for the opening of the much-anticipated "mini three
links."</P>
      <P>In related news, Chang Ching-sen, vice chairman of the Council
for Economic Planning and Development, said that if the "mini three
links" proceed smoothly, the government will consider expanding the
scope of enforcement to help cultivate a better investment climate in
the two offshore islands, which currently lag behind Taiwan in terms
of economic development.</P>

    <HEADLINE>OPPOSITION ALLIANCE COMPLETES FILING OF PRESIDENTIAL RECALL BILL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  22  (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition alliance submitted a
presidential recall bill to the Legislative Yuan Friday but stressed
that the move marked only a completion of the filing process and that
the actual motion for its passage will not be brought up at present.</P>
      <P>Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator Ting Shou-chung said that sending the
bill into the official legislative process is meant to put pressure
on President Chen Shui-bian of the Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP).</P>
      <P>Ting went on to say that if Chen still cannot come up with the
appropriate solutions to the nation's problems and ends up triggering
a wave of unemployment and bankruptcies, then the bill will be
introduced to the legislative floor to be voted on.</P>
      <P>He added that although the People First Party (PFP) did not send
a representative to submit the bill together with the KMT and the New
Party (NP), the PFP nevertheless supports the move.</P>
      <P>Ting, who authored the bill to oust both Chen and ROC Vice
President Annette Lu, began a drive to collect endorsement signatures
from other legislators Oct. 30 after the DPP administration abruptly
announced Oct. 27 its decision to scrap the controversial fourth
nuclear power plant project.</P>
      <P>The bill has the endorsement of 147 legislators, a two-thirds
majority in the 220-member legislature, which is required before the
bill can be approved, after which a nationwide referendum would
decide the outcome of the recall attempt. The opposition alliance of
the KMT, PFP, and NP jointly controls 141 seats, while the DPP holds
only 67 seats. The remaining seats are held by independents.</P>
      <P>According to a statement by the opposition alliance, although the
recall bill already has the endorsement of the required number of
legislators, the alliance "still holds a ray of hope" that the ruling
administration will "reflect upon itself."</P>
      <P>The statement went on to say that the root of the crisis facing
the nation is not the system itself, but rather the mentality and
actions of the Chen administration. "As the one in power only shouts
empty slogans and has no real solutions to the problems, Taiwan is
rapidly losing its economic advantages," it added.</P>
      <P>The statement also pointed to the "deepening degree of misery"
experienced by the people since the new administration took power in
May, citing stock market losses and frozen Taipei-Beijing relations
as reasons that the opposition alliance has the "responsibility to
warn those in power" in order to prevent the "Taiwan miracle" from
being "destroyed overnight."</P>

    <HEADLINE>POLITICAL STABILITY, SOUND POLICY KEY TO REVITALIZING ECONOMY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  22  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government must maintain domestic
political stability and craft sound financial and economic policies
if it wants to revitalize the sagging Taiwan economy, Academia Sinica
President Lee Yuan-tseh warned Friday.</P>
      <P>Quoting a report released by Academia Sinica's Institute of
Economics (IOE), Lee said the Republic of China economy will
apparently take a turn for the worse next year.</P>
      <P>"At this crucial moment, the government should do its utmost to
maintain domestic political stability and work out the right economic
and financial policies to regain public confidence in its
competence," Lee said, adding: "If the local public loses confidence,
it will be very difficult for us to resume our previous economic
boom."</P>
      <P>The IOE report forecast that Taiwan's economic growth rate would
decline from this year's estimated 6.23 percent to a mere 5.21
percent in 2001 and that the private consumption growth rate would
also drop to 4.63 percent from this year's estimated 5.76 percent.</P>
      <P>Despite the IOE's pessimistic forecast, Lee said he remains
confident in Taiwan's information-technology industry, citing that
15 new 12" wafer production facilities are being constructed in the
Tainan Science-based Industrial Park in southern Taiwan, which would
jointly increase Taiwan's integrated circuit (IC) production capacity
by more than 10 percent.</P>
      <P>Lee, a co-winner of the 1986 Nobel Prize in chemistry, further
said as the Taiwan economy has shown apparent signs of a slowdown in
recent months, now is not the right time to push for a drastic cut
in work hours.</P>
      <P>He was commenting on the opposition parties' insistence on
implementing a bi-weekly 84-hour workweek scheme from the beginning
of next year.</P>
      <P>Noting that shortening of work hours will affect productivity,
Lee said the opposition-proposed new workweek system would aggravate
Taiwan's economic woes as local labor productivity cannot
quickly upgrade to offset the decrease in work hours. In his view,
Lee said it is more reasonable to implement a 44-hour workweek
system proposed by the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)-led
government.</P>
      <P>Lee further said he thinks that Taiwan need not worry too much
about mainland China-bound investments by its companies. "So long
as our government and individual local companies work out effective
management systems, mainland-bound investments will not necessarily
lead to Taiwan's industrial hollowing out," he said.</P>
      <P>With economic globalization becoming a prevailing trend, Lee
went on, Taiwan companies should catch up with it to stay
competitive in the global market.</P>
      <P>Since President Chen Shui-bian, a DPP stalwart, assumed office in
May, Taiwan's stock market has plunged drastically while the
unemployment rate skyrocketing. Chen's approval rating has also
dropped to a new low in recent weeks.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the phenomenon, Lee said Chen's
minority administration has not operated smoothly partly because of
continued inter-party political wrangling.</P>
      <P>In fact, Lee said, the new DPP government has endeavored to shed
the bad practices left by the previous government over the past
seven months.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Lee said, there is still ample room for the Chen
administration to improve, particularly its inexperience in handling
many politically sensitive issues. "And it takes time for the new
government to reform systems and improve its operational
efficiency," he said, adding that the public and private sectors
should make concerted efforts to create a better living and
business climate.</P>

    <DATELINE>Tokyo, Dec. 22 (CNA)
(By Mike Chang &amp; Ed Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Representative to Japan Lo
Fu-chen said in Tokyo Friday that he was delighted to hear that
former ROC President Lee Teng-hui may visit Japan next spring.</P>
      <P>Lo also expressed the hope that parliamentarians in Taiwan and
Japan will strengthen their constructive interchanges and visits so
as to further promote mutual understanding and friendly relations
between the two countries.</P>
      <P>Lo made the remarks at a yearend press conference where he
briefed Taiwan media stationed in Tokyo on the operations and working
achievements of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in Tokyo
during the year.</P>
      <P>He said that the younger parliamentarians in the two countries
have decided to strengthen their relationships with each other
through more interchanges and visits.</P>
      <P>He also expressed the hope that Taiwan's younger parliamentarians
will spend more time studying about Japan so as to better grasp the
political changes and movements occurring in that country.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the issue of former President Lee Teng-hui's proposed
visit to Japan which has not yet been confirmed, Lo suggested that
next spring might be a good time for the visit.</P>
      <P>He added that the former president probably should have a
physical examination prior to the visit as he has recently undergone
surgery.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lo noted that statistics compiled by the Taiwan
Visitors Association reveal that a total of 835,000 Japanese citizens
visited Taiwan in the first 11 months of the year, adding that the
number may top the 900,000 mark for the year.</P>
      <P>At the same time, the statistics show that a total of 762,000
Taiwan citizens visited Japan during the same period this year, with

    <HEADLINE>DPP LEGISLATORS FAIL TO HAVE 84-HOUR PER TWO-WEEK WORK PLAN AMENDED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Dec.   22   (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Democratic Progressive Party
legislative caucus failed Friday in its attempt to amend the 84-hour
per two-week work plan, which is scheduled to go into effect Jan. 1,
2001.</P>
      <P>The DPP's attempt to have its alternative proposal of a 44-hour
workweek put on the agenda failed when 90 of the 162 legislators
present in the Legislative Yuan voted against the proposal. There
were seven abstentions.</P>
      <P>After the attempt failed, DPP party whip Hsu Tien-tsai said the
party, which only has a minority in the legislature, will continue to
work with the other political parties, adding that next Tuesday's
floor session will be the last opportunity to seek an amendment.</P>
      <P>The vote was held amid loud protests from management and labor
representatives outside the Legislative Yuan, with the managers
saying they cannot afford such a shortened workweek and the laborers
saying that their rights should be protected.</P>
      <P>Although the DPP's attempt failed, there were already signs that
the opposition alliance made up of the Kuomintang, the New Party, and
the People First Party might come around and not stick to the 84-hour
per two-week work plan in view of Taiwan's sluggish economic
situation, which could add fuel to fire if the workweek is put into
practice in a few days.</P>
      <P>The coalition, after intensive consultations, has come up with
the proposal that the overtime pay rate for laborers be cut so as to
cushion the dramatic effect of an 84-hour bi-weekly workweek, which
could cost employers a large amount in overtime salary costs.</P>
      <P>Lai Shyh-bao, party whip of the opposition New Party, said that
management has said reducing the workweek from 44 hours to an average
of 42 hours would cost them about NT$80 billion and so the
opposition has discussed cutting insurance premiums for laborers by 1
percent, which they said would save them about NT$10 billion, to make
up part of the losses.</P>
      <P>Lai had therefore proposed that the 84-hour bi-weekly workweek
could stand and that employers, after getting the consent of the
labor unions and half of the laborers, could adopt a 44-hour
workweek.</P>
      <P>Management said that it could accept such a proposal while labor
said that they would want the proposal to be discussed more, said
Lai.</P>
      <P>He Chi-huei, KMT party whip, said that the compromise will be
turned over to the management and the workers so that they can forge
a consensus and that the coalition would respect such a consensus
during the Legislative Yuan's floor session next Tuesday.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP LOW-KEY ON RESPONSE TO RECALL BILL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 22 (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Presidential Office on Friday remained
low-key in its response to the opposition alliance's filing of a
presidential recall bill in the Legislative Yuan earlier in the day,
saying only that Taiwan cannot afford to be divided at the moment.</P>
      <P>A presidential aide said that the Presidential Office hopes the
opposition alliance of the Kuomintang (KMT), the People First Party
(PFP), and the New Party (NP) can abandon its differences with the
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) administration and re-open the
doors of negotiation.</P>
      <P>Although the opposition alliance formally completed the process
of submitting the bill, which aims to recall both Republic of China
President Chen Shui-bian and Vice President Annette Lu, the alliance
assured the public that the actual motion to put the bill to a vote
will not come immediately.</P>
      <P>The alliance said that the bill is meant to put pressure on Chen
and to urge him to "observe the spirit of the ROC Constitution" and
not "arbitrarily twist the national system simply because of his
gains in personal power."</P>
      <P>In a statement made before submitting the bill, the alliance also
urged Chen to return to the Guidelines of National Unification in
order to re-open the doors to negotiation with Beijing on the basis
on the "1992 consensus." The government should also propose concrete
and effective measures to boost the economy and resolve the problem
of unemployment, the alliance added.</P>
      <P>According to an aide to KMT Chairman Lien Chan, Lien pointed out
at a traditional winter solstice dinner with KMT legislators the
previous evening that introducing the bill is meant to "leave a
record in history" and to "buy insurance for the people" before the
legislative session -- as well as the 20th century -- ends after this
month.</P>
      <P>PFP spokesman Sun Ta-chien, whose party's absence while
submitting the bill earlier in the day raised questions as to whether
the PFP truly supports the move, said that "the timing lacks
consideration," but that "there is currently no indication of the
possibility of going against the opposition alliance."</P>
      <P>However, he went on to say that there is still room for
discussion before the bill is actually introduced on the floor for a
vote and that if the developments are not congruent with "public
expectations," then the PFP "will carefully reconsider its options"
and "will not always follow the KMT's lead."</P>
      <P>Sun pointed out that the opposition alliance has wanted all along
to give Chen another chance to first resolve the country's financial
and economic problems, which he said is why the recall bill has not
yet been put into motion.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, DPP legislative whip Hsu Tien-tsai said that he
believes the move to make the recall bill official is meant to lead
the way for "a larger political move" in the future.</P>
      <P>Hsu said that the "political intent" of the move, coming on the
heels of a recent KMT subgroup internal proposal to oust Premier
Chang Chun-hsiung of the DPP and replace him with Legislative Yuan
President Wang Jin-pyng, a KMT vice chairman, is "obvious." The
series of moves seems to be aimed at forcing the Presidential Office
to make a "certain degree of compromise," Hsu added.</P>
      <P>Although the formalization of the recall bill is most likely "a
feint," the DPP legislative caucus will keep a close eye on the KMT,
he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ACADEMIA SINICA FORECASTS ROC'S 2001 GROWTH RATE AT 5.21%</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  22  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China's gross domestic
product (GDP) growth rate would drop to 5.21 percent in 2001 from
this year's estimated 6.23 percent, the Institute of Economics of
Academia Sinica, Taiwan's highest research body, predicted Friday.</P>
      <P>The institute said in a report on the overall outlook for the ROC
economy in 2001 that Taiwan's GDP growth reached a high of 7.93
percent in the first quarter of this year due to a continued
export boom and a rebound in the domestic demand.</P>
      <P>However, the report said, this strong upward swing reversed
itself following the island's first democratic transfer of power
from the Kuomintang (KMT) to the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
in May.</P>
      <P>The report said the domestic economy has since taken a turn for
the worse due to a host of factors, including a standoff between the
DPP minority government and the opposition-dominated legislature, an
about-face in major government economic and financial policies, poor
policy coordination among various government agencies and a slowdown
in the global economy.</P>
      <P>As a result, the report said the real GDP growth rate for 2000
is estimated at 6.23 percent, lower than originally expected.</P>
      <P>As for the next year, the report said the GDP growth rate would
further shrink to 5.23 percent due to a global economic slowdown and
weak domestic demand resulting from the fact that many local banks
have been plagued by high nonperforming debt rates.</P>
      <P>The report also predicted that the domestic private consumption
would rise a mere 4.63 percent next year, down from this year's
estimated growth of 5.76 percent, and that the 2001 growth rate for
private investment would be about 3.41 percent, far lower than this
year's 15.69 percent.</P>
      <P>According to the report, government consumption would register a
negative growth of 1.83 percent and government investment would
increase a marginal 0.98 percent next year.</P>
      <P>In addition, Taiwan's merchandise and service export growth rate
would shrink to 6.42 percent in the coming year and the import
growth rate would also plummet to 4.37 percent from this year's 15.67
percent.</P>
      <P>Wu Chung-shu, an Academia Sinica research fellow, said
several economic and non-economic factors would certainly affect
Taiwan's actual economic performance next year, including relations
between the DPP government and the opposition parties,
the development of cross-Taiwan Strait ties and the U.S. economic
situation.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CROSS-STRAIT CURRENCY EXCHANGES TO BE IMPLEMENTED IN STAGES: MAC HEAD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  22  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's top planner on mainland policy
said Friday that the matter of currency exchanges between the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait must be implemented in stages.</P>
      <P>Tsai Ing-wen, chairwoman of the Mainland Affairs Council, made
the remarks while attending a seminar sponsored by Legislator Lai
Shyh-bao of the opposition New Party on the topic of how to set up a
capital return mechanism for Taiwan businessmen operating across the
Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Lai said that the Ministry of Finance thinks that it can complete
the planning of cross-strait currency exchanges in four months so
that domestic banks can establish representative offices on the
mainland.</P>
      <P>Tsai said the MAC will basically follow the timetable of the
Ministry of Finance and that cross-strait currency exchanges will
have to take many things into consideration as Taiwan's overall
mainland policy and also the cross-strait trade and economic
structure will be involved.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lai made several suggestions, including that the
government improve the local investment environment, adjust its "go
slow, be patient" policy toward investment in the mainland, and take
the initiative in conducting tax negotiations with the mainland and
planning a cross-strait currency exchange mechanism.</P>
      <P>Tsai said that the issue of taxes is a thorny one, noting that
the mainland imposes heavier taxes than Taiwan does and that after
mainland taxes, Taiwan will have no room for taxation and will lose
tax revenue.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  22  (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of scholars Friday suggested to
President Chen Shui-bian that the government must speed up the
implementation of "three direct links" across the Taiwan Strait which
will benefit both Taiwan and mainland China.</P>
      <P>The group headed by Chi Schive, former vice chairman of the
Economic Planning and Development, also recommended that the
government should spend more effort on developing the economy and
less on talk about politics.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, they suggested that efforts be made to speed up
financial reform so as to reactivate the market and labor market.</P>
      <P>In order to deal with the worsening economic situation in Taiwan,
they said the government should moderately expand its investment in
the public sector and strongly improve the domestic investment
climate in order to restore consumer confidence.</P>
      <P>Touching on the cross-strait issue, they suggested the government
speed up implementation of the "three direct links" between Taiwan
and mainland China as both will benefit from the move and as it is in
line with the trend of globalization.</P>
      <P>Speaking on financial reform, they recommended that the

the aftermath of financial reform and that it improve the investment
climate so as to lure more high-tech investment to Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TOP 10 ROC DOMESTIC NEWS STORIES OF 2000</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  22 (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China's top news story in
2000 was the election to office of Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
presidential candidate Chen Shui-bian and vice presidential candidate
Annette Lu, according to a poll by local media editors.</P>
      <P>Together with the Central News Agency, a panel of domestic
editors-in-chief and news directors jointly selected the following as
the top ten domestic headlines for the year 2000, listed according to
the order of importance determined by the panel:</P>
      <P>1. The first political transfer of power from the Kuomintang
(KMT) to the DPP took place as Chen and Lu were elected to the posts
of the 10th ROC president and vice president, respectively.</P>
      <P>2. The new DPP administration announced a stop to the
controversial fourth nuclear power plant project, drawing strong
criticism from the opposition parties for the timing of the
announcement and inadvertently triggering the formation of the
opposition alliance among the KMT, the People First Party (PFP), and
the New Party (NP), which sought to recall Chen and Lu from office.</P>
      <P>3. The unstable domestic political situation, compounded by a
lack of breakthroughs in Taipei-Beijing relations and a lackluster
year in the global economic environment, led to a sharp year-long 40
percent plunge in the local stock market and a continual depreciation
of the local currency to 33 New Taiwan dollars against the greenback.</P>
      <P>4. KMT stalwart and former defense minister Tang Fei was
appointed premier in the new administration during the transition
from the KMT government to the DPP government in order to stabilize
the political situation, only to be replaced by Chang Chung-hsiung of
the DPP after four months in office for what was widely held to be
differences of opinion with the DPP over the nuclear power plant
issue.</P>
      <P>5. The death of four workers who were trapped in rising waters
during a flash flood while waiting for a rescue that never came --
because of opposing claims by the helicopter arm of the police force
and that of the air force that the area was the other's
responsibility. The fiasco focused attention on the new government's
ineffective crisis-response mechanism and led to the punishment of
related officials.</P>
      <P>6. The new government announced the implementation of the "mini
three links" -- direct trade, transportation, and postal links
between the frontline islands of Kinmen and Matsu and designated
ports in mainland China's Fujian province -- at the end of the year
and the trial opening of Taiwan-proper to mainland Chinese tourists
and capital in June 2001.</P>
      <P>7. Then-KMT Chairman Lee Teng-hui resigned to take responsibility
for the party's defeat in the presidential election, after which the
KMT began a series of reforms under the leadership of the new
chairman, Lien Chan.</P>
      <P>8. A Singapore Airlines 747 attempting to take off from a runway
under repair at Chiang Kai-shek International Airport in typhoon
conditions crashed into heavy construction equipment, killing 82
people onboard and injuring 49.</P>
      <P>9. Typhoons Kai-tak, Bilis, and Xangsane wreaked havoc across the
island, particularly Xangsane, which caused immense flood damage to
the greater Taipei area.</P>
      <P>10. The National Assembly was stripped of most of its
constitutional powers after amendments worked out by both the KMT and
the DPP were passed to limit its functions, transferring the rest to
the Legislative Yuan.</P>

      <P>The Republic of China will fully open its
livestock products market in 2005, the Cabinet-level Council of
Agriculture (COA) said Friday.</P>
      <P>In order to adapt ROC's livestock products industry to a new

in 2001, the COA has mapped out a six-year plan on the adaption of
the livestock products industry.</P>
      <P>Cheng Chung-chiang, director of the Animal Industry Department
under the COA, said that according to the ROC's WTO entry promise,
the import quota for livestock products must be canceled on an
all-out basis in 2005. No application for quota on the importation of
pork, chicken, and chopped entrails will be required from that time,
he said.</P>
      <P>Cheng said the six-year adaption plan's ultimate goal is to let
domestically produced livestock products and imported livestock
products reach a balance through a control in total quantity.</P>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The large-scale military exercises held by
mainland China's military in August was the top mainland China news
story of 2000, as selected by editor-in-chiefs and news executives of
the Central News Agency and other news media in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The list of top stories in order is as follows:</P>
      <P>-- The Nanjing military region held the largest sea drill in
recent years in early August in the Yellow Sea and the East China
Sea, with as many as 110,000 military personnel taking part in the
drill conducted from Lianyun Harbor, Jiangzu to the north and Shaoan,
Fujian to the south;</P>
      <P>-- Mainland China issued a white paper on the "one China
principle and Taiwan issue" to explain the basic stance and policy,
hoping to influence the outcome of Taiwan's presidential election
held in March and to sway international opinion to its side;</P>
      <P>-- Mainland China issued a statement through the Xinhua News
Agency that it will "listen to the words and observe the deeds" of
Chen Shui-bian of the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party
after he was elected President of the Republic of China;</P>
      <P>-- Mainland China reiterated the "three ifs" in its white paper
on national defense for 2000, saying it will do everything possible
to win peaceful unification. The "three ifs" refer to the use of
force against Taiwan if the island declares independence or if there
is an intervention of foreign forces or if the island drags its feet
on negotiations indefinitely;</P>
      <P>-- Beijing authorities arrested thousands of Falung Gong members
on mainland China's National Day on Oct. 1 when they held their

the Taiwan issue cannot not be delayed indefinitely;</P>
      <P>-- The Central Office for Taiwan Affairs under the State Council
issued a statement in the wake of President Chen Shui-bian's
inaugural speech that as long as Taiwan clearly promises it will not
define cross-strait relations as "state-to-state" and insist that
Taiwan's Association for Relation Across the Taiwan Strait and
mainland China's Straits Exchange Foundation, two semi-official
intermediary bodies, reached a consensus in 1992 on the "one China"
principle, then Beijing would authorize the ARATS to contact and hold
dialogue with the groups or individuals authorized by Taiwan;</P>
      <P>-- Mainland China President Jiang Zemin said during a meeting
with a business delegation from Taiwan that Beijing has insisted on
peaceful unification and that he does not hope to see a cross-strait
war, but added that Beijing will not renounce the option of the use
of force against Taiwan if necessary;</P>
      <P>-- Taipei announces the opening of Taiwan to mainland China's
media, but Beijing criticizes the related regulations as not
reasonable; and</P>
      <P>-- Beijing convicted the first batch of suspects in mid-November
in the crackdown on a smuggling ring which has implicated as many as
800 mainland officials.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.S. FRUSTRATED IN PRESSING PRC TO IMPROVE HUMAN RIGHTS RECORDS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Dec.  22 (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The U.S. assistant secretary of state
for human rights affairs admitted Friday that there are frustrations
in pressing Communist China to improve its human rights records and
that certain congressional sanctions ought to be imposed on a country
"engaged in such unusually severe violations."</P>
      <P>In an interview with the Voice of America radio station, Harold
Koh pointed out that expectations were raised in the summer of 1998
when China's President Jiang Zemin made statements during U.S.
President Bill Clinton's visit about opening dialogue on the issues
of human rights and Tibet with the United States. Mainland China also
signaled at the time that it intended to sign and ratify the two
major covenants on international human rights, Koh added.</P>
      <P>Since then, he said, "we have had disappointing trends across the
board with regard to suppression of democracy activists, issues of
religious freedom, Internet restrictions, and restrictions on free
labor."</P>
      <P>"One of the reasons the Chinese government finds these movements
-- Christian, Uighurs, Tibetans -- worrisome is that they think they
are 'splitists,'" he added.</P>
      <P>In other words, Koh explained, these movements "may bring about
the separation of political entities and may lead to the breakup of
China, something the leaders in Beijing seem to be very worried
about. So they associate religious freedom with some sort of
breakaway movement."</P>
      <P>Secondly, he noted, for a Communist system to have people who
believe in something more fervently than communism is very
threatening to the system itself. The Falun Gong, which is a group of
individuals with a certain set of beliefs that are not particularly
political, poses that kind of threat, he said.</P>
      <P>The Communist Chinese have therefore pursued a really severe and
enhanced crackdown policy against the extremely well-organized Falun
Gong movement. And in response, Koh said, the Falun Gong has only
become more organized and has started to make better use of the
Internet to publicize its concerns.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the ranking U.S. official confirmed, at least five
churches and two Buddhist temples in the Wenzhou area have been
destroyed by mainland Chinese authorities in the last few weeks.
"This is completely appalling, particularly at Christmas time.
Frankly, it's extraordinarily counterproductive," he said.</P>
      <P>Koh said it is for these three reasons, among others, that "we
have focused so much on human rights conditions in China in our daily
statements, in our human rights reports."</P>
      <P>"And for the last two years, I have designated China as a country
of `particular concern' for the International Religious Freedom Act,"
he added.</P>
      <P>In response to the VOA reporter's question as to what his
definition of a country of `particular concern' is, Koh replied that
it is one "that is engaged in unusually severe violations on which
certain sets of congressional sanctions ought to be visited."</P>
      <P>Koh did add however that "there have been astonishing changes in
China -- much greater economic freedom, expansion of commerce, the
development of markets. All of these have given the Chinese people a
much greater interest and lust for freedom and a greater capacity to
communicate with one another."</P>

    <HEADLINE>NPA PITCHES FOR CROSS-STRAIT COOPERATION IN FIGHTING CRIME</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  23  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The National Police Administration (NPA)
said Saturday it plans to send criminal investigators to mainland
China to push for bilateral cooperation in fighting crime across the
Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The NPA said it has come up with the initiative after its
Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB) received information that
mainland China's public security authorities have launched a series
of anti-organized crime campaigns since October in the southeastern
coastal areas, including Guangdong Province and cosmopolitan
Shanghai.</P>
      <P>NPA officials said the current mainland anti-organized crime
operations are mainly designed to eradicate "bad elements" from Hong
Kong and Macau, many of whom have reportedly colluded with
Guangdong- and Shanghai-based criminal rings in conducting criminal
activities.</P>
      <P>According to CIB sources, at least 100-plus wanted Taiwan
fugitives have fled to the mainland. However, the sources said, many
of wanted Taiwan criminal ringleaders have managed to travel to rural
or inland mainland provinces for hiding amid the current mainland
crackdowns on organized crime in the coastal regions.</P>
      <P>Senior police officers said the NPA plans to send CIB
staff members to the mainland to get first-hand information about
mainland China's ongoing anti-crime campaign and to discuss
cross-strait cooperation in fighting major crimes, including
smuggling of firearms and other contraband goods, drug trafficking
and robbery.</P>
      <P>CIB officials said the two sides of the Taiwan Strait now can
exchange information about criminal investigations through their Red
Cross Societies or Taipei's Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) and its
mainland counterpart -- the Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Strait (ARATS) -- in line with the Kinmen Agreement signed by
the Taiwan and mainland China Red Cross Societies in the early
1990s.</P>
      <P>"Such indirect communication mechanisms, however, have often
undermined efficiency in anti-crime operations," a CIB official
said, adding that he hopes criminal investigators on both sides can
cooperate directly and more closely in fighting crime.</P>
      <P>As mainland China still declines to resume dialogue with Taiwan
for political reasons, the official said the CIB may send staff
members to visit Beijing to push mainland authorities to pay
attention to the need for cross-strait cooperation in thwarting
cross-border criminal activities.</P>

    <HEADLINE>14 TYPES OF FISH SOLD ON MARKET FOUND TO CONTAIN TOXIC POLLUTANTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 23 (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A recent study of freshwater and saltwater
fish being sold on the market in Taiwan revealed excessive amounts of
persistent organic pollutants (POPs), synthetic chemicals that are
linked to cancer, birth defects, and developmental problems.</P>
      <P>The Environmental Quality Protection Foundation (EQPF), which
funded the research, announced Saturday the disturbing results of the
National Tsinghua University (NTHU) study, which was conducted on 30
types of fish purchased in September from supermarkets and
traditional markets in the greater Hsingchu area in northern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>EQPF Secretary-General Liu Ming-lung said that although numerous
types of POPs have long been banned in the country, 14 out of the 30
fish types studied -- including such local dinner table favorites as
milkfish, hairtail, salmon, goldenthreads, and threestripe tigerfish
-- showed residues of the toxic chemicals. Furthermore, four of the
14 types of fish showed traces of organochlorine pesticides exceeding
international standards, he added.</P>
      <P>POPs break down in the environment extremely slowly, travel
thousands of miles in the air and water, and are extremely toxic to
wildlife and humans. Due to the persistency of these compounds and
the quantity used years ago -- ironically, for the purpose of
controlling disease, increasing food production, and improving the
standard of living -- they are still prevalent in different
environmental matrices such as soil, sediment, and biota.</P>
      <P>NTHU chemistry professor Ling Yung-chien, who conducted the
study, said that six out of the seven fish types with the greatest
concentration of POP residues are either saltwater fish or come from
mainland China. Therefore, he stressed the necessity of setting down
relevant government control measures as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Concurring, Liu said that inevitably closer exchanges with
mainland China in the future makes it all the more important for the
government to establish POP control measures because mainland China
currently has no laws prohibiting the POPs under question.</P>
      <P>Ling said that POPs are usually concentrated under the skin, in
fats, and in the internal organs of the fish. Therefore, he suggested
that the public can refrain from ingesting these parts of the fish.
Smaller or less mature fish may also contain less POP build-up, he
added.</P>
      <P>POPs are not soluble in water, but they dissolve readily in fats
and oils. Because of their resistance to degradation and their
affinity for fat, POPs accumulate in the body fat of living organisms
and become more concentrated as they move from one creature to
another onward and upward through the food web.</P>
      <P>In this way, extremely small levels of such contaminants in water
or soil can magnify into a significant hazard to predators who feed
at the top of the food web, such as dolphins, polar bears, herring
gulls, and humans.</P>
      <P>The Tsinghua study comes on the heels of a recent breakthrough in
global POP control efforts. On Dec. 10, diplomats from 122 countries
completed their fifth and final negotiating session on a treaty for
POPs and finalized the text of the legally binding document.</P>
      <P>The treaty is expected to be formally adopted and signed by
plenipotentiaries at a diplomatic conference in Stockholm on May 22,
2001. Ratification by at least 50 countries will be required before
the treaty enters into force, a process likely to take three to four
years.</P>
      <P>The 12 chemicals targeted under the POPs Treaty are
hexachlorobenzene (listed in two forms: as a fungicide and as an
industrial chemical), endrin, mirex, toxaphene, chlordane,
heptachlor, DDT, aldrin, dieldrin, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs),
dioxins, and furans.</P>
      <P>The treaty calls for the elimination of eight of the 12 toxic
chemicals while adopting severe restrictions on the use of DDT and
creating a "roadmap" toward the elimination of PCBs and the two
unintentional byproducts, dioxins and furans. It also seeks to
provide technical and financial assistance to developing nations to
help them move toward safer alternatives.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC PREMIER URGES SUPPORT FOR 44-HOUR WORKWEEK</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  Dec.  23  (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung emphasized
Saturday that the 44-hour workweek policy is beneficial to both
management and labor and urged all sides to support it.</P>
      <P>Chang made the remarks after the Democratic Progressive Party
legislative caucus failed Friday in its attempt to force an amendment
to a revised Labor Standards Law that sets the standard of 84 work
hours per two-week period.</P>
      <P>Chang indicated that as Taiwan's unemployment rate is climbing,
the government has presented the 44-hour workweek plan to create a
"win-win" situation for both management and labor.</P>
      <P>He added that the reduction in the number of workweek hours under
the Labor Standards Law will definitely cost employers a large amount
in overtime salary costs, saying that when management cannot handle
the surging costs, they will have to shut down plants, thereby
leading to an increase in Taiwan's unemployment rate.</P>
      <P>The premier said he would like to see the 44-hour workweek policy
approved by the Legislative Yuan after discussions and negotiations
between the government, opposition parties, management, and labor.</P>
      <P>He stressed that the Cabinet has no other alternative plan to the
44-hour workweek policy and urged all sectors to not let this
beneficial economic policy be sacrificed due to political factors.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the government spokesman, Su Cheng-ping, said Saturday
that the Cabinet will continue soliciting support for the work plan,
adding that it has no right to be pessimistic.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN'S JAN.-NOV. ENERGY CONSUMPTION UP 6.4 PERCENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  23 (CNA)
(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's energy consumption for the first
10 months of 2000 was equivalent to 74.86 million kiloliters of
petroleum, representing a 6.4 percent increase over consumption in
the same period of the previous year, the Energy Commission under the
Ministry of Economic Affairs said Saturday.</P>
      <P>The Energy Commission said that the increase in energy
consumption was mainly due to the increase in export orders in the
first half of this year, especially export orders for
the communications and information technology industries.</P>
      <P>Statistics indicate that the amount of energy consumed by the
industrial sector, which usually accounts for more than half of
Taiwan's energy consumption, rose by 7.9 percent during the
January-October period.</P>
      <P>The increase was as high as 35.9 percent for the electronics and
machinery industries (including the information-technology industry),
and 9 percent for the chemical products manufacturing industry.</P>
      <P>Energy consumption by manufacturers of paper pulp, steel, and
cement however was down or remained unchanged for this period.</P>
      <P>The Energy Commission said it foresees only a mild increase in
energy consumption over the coming months as growth in the island's
industrial production has been slowing down, with the rate for
November up only 1.63 percent over that of November in the previous
year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.S. SCHOLAR URGES BUSH TO BRING TAIPEI, BEIJING TO BARGAINING TABLE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Dec.  22  (CNA)
(By Jay Chen and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A noted American expert on China
issues has clearly urged the new U.S. administration to actively
seek to bring the two sides of the Taiwan Strait to bargaining
table.</P>
      <P>David Shambaugh, director of the China Policy Program at George
Washington University, made the pitch in an article printed in the
January/February 2001 issue of the "Foreign Affairs" magazine.</P>
      <P>Shambaugh warned in his article, titled "Facing Reality in China
Policy," that the current impasse between Taiwan and mainland China
is fraught with danger, saying it threatens U.S. interests as well
as broader peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region.</P>
      <P>While not trying to mediate the intractable problem, Shambaugh
said, the incoming George W. Bush administration should actively
seek to bring Taipei and Beijing to the negotiating table.</P>
      <P>"The need to jump-start a dialogue and build a sustainable
framework of interaction between Taipei and Beijing is pressing,"
Shambaugh noted, adding that this is not a problem amenable to easy
solutions and that any resolution must be agreed on by both sides
rather than imposed by either one.</P>
      <P>The pro-Beijing scholar further said any official
cross-strait dialogue must take the "one China" principle as the
starting point.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Shambaugh said he thinks that the concept of
confederation offers the best hope for an ultimate solution as "it
would bring the island back into the sovereign fold of China while
guaranteeing substantial autonomy to Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Before this win-win solution can be reached ultimately,
Shambaugh said, a variety of cross-strait interim agreements could
be signed to preserve stability while progressively moving toward a
new confederal system.</P>
      <P>Shambaugh also pointed out that an essential component of any
interim agreement would be a pledge by mainland China not to use
force in return for a pledge by Taiwan not to declare independence.</P>
      <P>The noted China hand further reminded U.S. President-elect
Bush that his foreign policy and security team has to adjust
itself to a number of pressing realities in crafting and
implementing policies toward mainland China and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>For one thing, Shambaugh said, the new U.S. administration will
have to make the next round of decisions in April 2001 on
conventional arms sales to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"The decision, deferred last year, on whether to sell Arleigh
Burke-class destroyers equipped with sophisticated Aegis
battle-management systems and anti-missile defenses will be
particularly sensitive and has the potential to precipitate a
diplomatic crisis with Beijing," Shambaugh wrote, adding: "The
administration needs to be prepared for the fallout if it decides to
proceed." Beijing has on many occasions expressed strong opposition
to U.S. sales of these advanced weapons to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In addition, Shambaugh said, U.S. policymakers will also face
ongoing choices about helping Taiwan upgrade its military
command-and-control infrastructure and potentially providing theater
missile defenses (TMD) for the island.</P>
      <P>In his article, Shambaugh also wrote that if Beijing truly
wishes to solve the Taiwan problem, it must be prepared to undertake
substantial political changes at home.</P>
      <P>"It must shed its ossified positions and develop a truly
innovative and flexible formula that actually attracts Taiwan back
into the national fold. Forcing unification will never work, and the
Hong Kong model will not satisfy the Taiwanese," he stressed.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EDUCATION MINISTRY WORKING ON RECOGNIZING MAINLAND CHINESE DEGREES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 23 (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Education Minister Ovid Tzeng said Saturday
that the timetable for the implementation of a policy to officially
recognize degrees conferred by mainland Chinese higher centers of
learning will depend on other related government agencies.</P>
      <P>However, he added that his ministry will continue to collect
related information on those institutions so that the process can
move forward quickly whenever the decision is made by other
ministries and agencies such as the Mainland Affairs Council, which
is in charge of planning the Republic of China's policies toward
mainland China.</P>
      <P>Responding to call-in questions on a Central Broadcasting System
radio program, Tzeng said that the process may not be "as slow as
everyone thinks" in light of the fact that the government appears to
be working on one mainland China-related policy after another.</P>
      <P>He pointed out such examples as the "mini three links" -- direct
trade, postal, and transportation links between Taiwan's outlying
Kinmen and Matsu islands and designated ports in mainland China's
Fujian province -- scheduled to kickoff Jan. 1, to be followed by the
"three direct links" between Taiwan-proper and mainland China.</P>
      <P>The most important task for the education ministry is to maintain
control over the list of acceptable degrees and institutions and to
ensure that the right to make such decisions stays in Taiwan, he
added.</P>
      <P>Tzeng went on to say that the preparations are necessary because
if Taiwan lacks certain talent in such areas as high tech industries
or Chinese medicine and plans to import them from mainland China in
the future, then the ROC government must provide the means to
recognize their education.</P>
      <P>Regarding the information on 73 higher centers of learning in
mainland China that the education ministry compiled two years ago,
Vice Education Minister Lu Mu-lin said that the ministry is in the
process of gathering more up-to-date data before planning a possible
trip to visit those institutions for further evaluations.</P>

      <P>Republic of China Vice President Annette Lu
said Saturday she hopes that there will be no wars in the coming
century and that there will be peaceful ties between the two sides of
Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>In an activity titled "reflection on war, pursuit of peace"
celebrated in Taipei, Lu indicated that it is sad that two world wars
broke out this century.</P>
      <P>"Those who launched the wars thought they might resolve many
problems, however, they were proved wrong. On the contrary, the wars
produced more problems," Lu said, pointing out that World War II
lasted six years and resulted in the loss of more than 40
millions of lives.</P>
      <P>Lu, who has been dedicated to promoting Taiwan's democracy for
many years, said people should learn from the two world wars, which
brought tremendous suffering to humankind.</P>
      <P>"All countries should give up the foolish notion of waging war
and let peace exist forever among people," Lu said, asking if
"Europeans can tear down barriers between themselves and establish a
`European Union,' then why can't Asians?"</P>
      <P>She said she has promoted the concept of a "Union of Asian
States" with the hope that countries give up the notions of territory
and sovereignty and instead cooperate as a common community for their
collective future.</P>
      <P>As the countdown to the end of the current century gets underway,
Lu said she hopes everybody prays with her for peaceful relations
between Taiwan and mainland China and world peace in the next
century.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>John Chang, a member of the opposition
Kuomintang's (KMT's) decision-making Central Standing Committee, left
for mainland China Saturday for a fact-finding visit.</P>
      <P>Chang, a former KMT secretary-general and a former Republic of

visiting the mainland in his capacity as president of a newly formed
association to promote the development of Taiwan-funded companies in
mainland China.</P>
      <P>Chang said he will visit major mainland industrial zones
which accommodate large crowds of Taiwan companies, including
Shanghai, Suzhou, Xiamen, Shantou, Dongkuan and Zhuhai, to get
first-hand information about working conditions and everyday lives of
Taiwanese business people there.</P>
      <P>"In view of increasing Taiwan investments on the mainland as
well as growing commercial and civilian exchanges across the
Taiwan Strait, it is necessary for us to show more concern for
the activities of Taiwanese investors as well as their
living and working conditions," Chang said.</P>
      <P>Chang was accompanied by his wife, legislators and several
business executives with interests in mainland China.</P>
      <P>Attracted by cheap labor and land costs and a common language

into the mainland for various investment projects over the past
decade.</P>
      <P>Chang, a son of the late President Chiang Ching-kuo born out
of the wedlock, also visited the mainland earlier this year to pay
tribute to ancestors of the Chiang clan.</P>
      <P>Chang resigned from the post of secretary-general to former

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian has no plans to
visit in the next month any Southeast Asian states that don't
recognize Taiwan, reported the China Times on Sunday.</P>
      <P>The China Times quoted officials from the Presidential Office as

Taiwan, indirectly denying media reports Friday that he will visit
some unnamed Southeast Asian states during that time.</P>
      <P>Vice Foreign Minister David Lee confirmed the officials'
statements, saying that his ministry has not made any such plans,
which he added would certainly be blocked by Beijing if made public.</P>
      <P>The plan to have Chen stop in Singapore and Malaysia, both states
that do not have formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan, on his way back
from a visit to allies in Central America and Africa in August was

Macedonia his diplomatic foothold in Europe, adding that Vice
President Annette Lu is also interested in visiting Macedonia and is

    <HEADLINE>EXPERTS PREDICT REBOUND IN ECONOMY IN SECOND QUARTER NEXT YEAR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  24  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's economic growth will slow down
next year but will rebound in the second quarter, two economic
experts predicted Sunday.</P>
      <P>Lee Kao-chao, vice chairman of the Cabinet-level Council for
Economic Planning and Development, and Wu Rong-i, president of the
think tank Taiwan Institute of Economic Research, made the remarks
during a TV program on Taiwan Television Enterprise.</P>
      <P>Wu said Taiwan's economic growth this year will be 6.47 percent
and will be lower next year, although not as low as 1999's level of
5.7 percent. He added that economic growth in the United States is
expected to fall to between three and 3.5 percent next year.</P>
      <P>Wu said that next year's expected lower economic growth is not
unusual and that there is no need to make a fuss about it. He pointed
out that slower U.S. economic growth next year and a rebound in
Japan's economy after a decade of sluggishness will affect Taiwan's
economy.</P>
      <P>But he also mentioned some unpredictable factors that may affect
forecasts about Taiwan's economic growth, including a depreciation in
the U.S. dollar, fluctuating oil prices, and the cross-strait
situation.</P>
      <P>Wu predicted that Taiwan's economy will hit bottom in the first
quarter next year and will then rebound in the second quarter.</P>
      <P>Wu also predicted that the U.S. dollar will weaken next year,
while the Euro and the Japanese yen will get stronger. He added that
the U.S. dollar could depreciate by as much as three percent and, in
contrast, the new Taiwan dollar will likely appreciate.</P>
      <P>He noted however that as Taiwan's stock market is expected to
continue to slump and as people may want to buy U.S. dollars,
Taiwan's currency may be driven down.</P>
      <P>On whether the government will try to expand domestic demand, Lee
said the CEPD has planned to do so for some time and is now waiting
for a decision.</P>
      <P>On the opening of direct trade, postal, and transport links with
mainland China, Wu said the establishment of the "three direct links"
will not be a panacea for Taiwan's economy.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan brushed aside
questions about why some of former Kuomintang Chairman Lee Teng-hui's
cronies have not yet re-registered their party membership when there
are only five days to go before the end of the re-registration
period.</P>
      <P>Emerging from a Christmas Party organized by the Kuomintang for
children, Lien refused to comment on questions shouted by reporters
as to why Lee's cronies have not registered their party membership.</P>
      <P>With the Dec. 31 deadline for Kuomintang members to reconfirm
their allegiance to the party by re-registering drawing near, the
China Times revealed Sunday that former party secretary-general Huang
Kuen-huei, former party spokesman Huang Hwei-chen, former chief of
party business management committee Liu Tai-ying, and former Minister
of the Interior Huang Chu-wen have still not done so.</P>
      <P>The news fueled speculation that supporters of Lee are
considering forming a new political movement, as suggested by Liu
Tai-ying.</P>
      <P>Although the speculation turned out to have been based on Liu's
personal suggestion, the fact that four of Lee's cronies have still
not re-registered suggests that there is a division between the
followers of Lee and Lien.</P>
      <P>Huang Kuen-huei is said to bear a grievance against the new party
authorities because he was blamed by Lien's supporters for not doing
his best to help Lien's presidential campaign and was not rewarded
with any job within the party after he quit as the party
secretary-general to take responsibility for Lien's defeat in the
March 18 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Huang Huei-chen has been at odds with the new party authorities
ever since he voiced his opposition to the party legislators' crusade
for a possible recall of President Chen Shui-bian over Chen's
decision in October to scrap the island's fourth nuclear plant.</P>
      <P>Although Lien's staff said that there are still five days left to
register and that the party will invite the former party heavyweights
to reclaim their party membership, analysts said Lien's shift away
from Lee's strong pro-Taiwan stance has alienated Lee's followers.</P>
      <P>They said Lien's attempts to win over the support of the party's
traditional members by watering down Lee's pro-Taiwan line might
prompt the exodus of Lee's supporters.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EPZ EXPORT BOOM EXPECTED IN FIRST QUARTER OF NEXT YEAR</HEADLINE>

(By Edward Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Despite declining domestic economic
prospects, the Export Processing Administration under the control of
the Ministry of Economic Affairs has predicted that the export
processing zone (EPZ) will experience an export boom in the first
quarter of next year.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for the EPA said that since efforts were made to

their capital investment into the EPZ.</P>
      <P>Investors had thrown in a total of NT$50 billion in new
investments into the EPZ as of the end of November. Furthermore,
several famous factories and companies have also expressed their
interest in investing in the EPZ.</P>
      <P>According to a survey conducted by the EPA concerning the

investors were optimistic about exports, especially those producers
of electronics, machinery, chemical products, and electrical
appliances.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT DUE TO HOLD TEA PARTY WITH PRESS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  24  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian will hold a
year-end tea party with the press before Chinese New Year, which
falls on Jan. 24.</P>
      <P>The tea party will be held after a three-month hiatus of his
monthly press conference.</P>
      <P>President Chen, in a tacit agreement with the press, had held a
press conference every month since his inauguration May 20 to report
directly to the nation. At these gatherings, he has usually spoken
for an hour and then has held a one-hour question-and-answer session.</P>
      <P>The president had maintained a popularity rating of more than 60
percent between June and September, during which he held four of
these press conferences. Then, his popularity began to slip as he was
faced with a number of domestic problems. No press conferences have
been held since.</P>
      <P>After the resignation of KMT stalwart Tang Fei as a premier,
President Chen's minority government faced even more difficulties
with the opposition parties.</P>
      <P>Chen faced a major political storm after the opposition alliance
moved to recall him in the wake of the premier's abrupt announcement
to scrap the construction of the fourth nuclear plant shortly after
the president's meeting with Lien Chan, chairman of the Kuomintang,
during which he promised to give more thought to the KMT's pet
project.</P>
      <P>The president later apologized to Lien and the public in a video
taped broadcast and said that he would adjust his style. Chen has
since reacted in a low-key manner to various political issues and has
let the Executive Yuan speak on them instead.</P>
      <P>It is expected the topics of the slumping Taiwan currency and
stock market, the recall motion by the opposition alliance, criticism
of the government by business tycoons, and the controversy over
the workweek scheme will all be raised at the year-end tea party.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MORE THAN 70% APPROVE OF NATIONAL HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 24 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>More than 70 percent of the public approves
of the current National Health Insurance program, according to the
results of a survey released on Sunday.</P>
      <P>The survey by Kuomintang think tank, the National Policy
Foundation, also showed that nearly 70 percent of those interviewed
said the current premium under the program is acceptable and that it
should not be wiped out for suffering a loss which they said should
be covered by the government instead of by raising the premium or
cutting down the insurance payment.</P>
      <P>The poll carried out among 1,265 adults found that most of those
interviewed disapprove of the idea of offering better health care to
those willing to pay more under the system.</P>
      <P>More than 70 percent of the respondents said they do not oppose
the opening of clinics for the exclusive use by patients who pay for
the service or the bringing under the program's coverage rare
disorders which are costly in treatment and difficult to cure.</P>
      <P>Hsueh Cheng-tai, a professor at National Taiwan University, said
the survey showed that a majority of the people think the program is
relative fair and appropriately takes care of disadvantaged groups,
but it also revealed that most are unwilling to pay more to improve
the system.</P>
      <P>Yang Chih-liang, the former vice minister of the Department of
Health and now a professor at National Taiwan University, said that
although 38.3 percent of those surveyed blamed the excessive amount
of medicine administered to patients under the system as the main
source of losses, 76 percent said they opposed abolishing the program
simply because of the losses.</P>
      <P>Instead, 24.6 percent of them said the government should cover
the loss, and less than 20 percent said the insured should pay more
to save the program from bankruptcy.</P>
      <P>This attitude is similar to that which is found in most Western
countries, Yang said.</P>
      <P>In general, Yang said, the people believe health care is a part
of social welfare and should be run by the government but also
understand health coverage for high-medical risk groups is a heavy
burden on the society.</P>
      <P>The National Health Insurance program, initiated by the
Kuomintang in 1995, is touted by the party as one of its major
achievements.</P>

      <P>Kaohsiung Mayor Frank Hsieh reaffirmed
Sunday that he will seek reelection and will not take any position in
the Cabinet.</P>
      <P>Hsieh, who is also the chairman of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party, made the remarks after he addressed a rally in a
public square on the second anniversary of his inauguration.</P>
      <P>Asked whether he would take a post in the Legislative Yuan or the
Executive Yuan, he said he will definitely seek reelection as mayor,
adding that he would even turn down an invitation by President Chen
Shui-bian to serve as the premier.</P>
      <P>In his speech, Hsieh promised that the development of Kaohsiung
in the next century will begin soon, noting that Kaohsiung Harbor,
which is now under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Transportation
and Communication, will be turned over to Kaohsiung city next May.
Also, construction on the rapid transit project will begin in
January, he added.</P>
      <P>In addition, he said that the software technology industrial park
now under construction and the proposed multi-function trade and
economic industrial park will be valuable assets helping turn
Kaohsiung into a global planning and management center.</P>
      <P>He said with some pride that of all the cities in Taiwan,
Kaohsiung, with its advantages of having both a harbor and an
airport, will be the best city for cross-strait transport.</P>
      <P>He also spoke of his performance over the past two years, but
touched little on the questions concerning clear water, river
cleaning as well social order, which have long been criticized by
Kaohsiung citizens.</P>
      <P>On recent polls which revealed his low popularity, Hsien defended
himself by saying that even if his performance were tops among all
city mayors, he still might not receive a high support rating from
the public.</P>
      <P>It is known that political figures, eyeing the vital city and
county head and legislative elections scheduled for the end of next
year, have been carefully observing whether Hsien will seek
reelection before deciding their next move.</P>
      <P>Although Hsieh has only fared modestly in public polls on his
administrative performance, reports that he may be promoted to the
post of premier have not ceased.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan-based United Microelectronics
Corp.'s (UMC) huge investment in Singapore to build a wafer plant
will result in a climax next year in Taiwan business' investment in
Singapore, Chuang Cheng-yuan, director of the economic affairs
division of Taiwan's representative office in Singapore said Sunday.</P>
      <P>UMC and German Siemens group announced recently a US$3.6 billion
joint venture to build a 12-inch wafer plant in Singapore. The UMC
will hold at least half of the wafer plant's stake, meaning the
capital it injects into the project will total at least US$1.8
billion.</P>
      <P>With UMC's huge investment in Singapore, Taiwan businessmen's
investment in the Southeast Asian nation is expected to reach at
least US$1.89 billion next year, for the highest level ever recorded,
he said.</P>
      <P>UMC signed an agreement with the Siemens group in December this
year, and construction on the wafer plant is scheduled to start next
year. As a result, the investment value will not be listed in the
Singaporean government's statistics as an investment from abroad for
this year.</P>
      <P>It is expected that the capital earmarked for the plant by the
joint venture will be cast into Singapore on a step-by-step basis,
with the first batch of capital going there early next year.</P>
      <P>As of the end of August of this year, Taiwan businessmen's
realized direct investment in Singapore had topped US$125 million,
according to Singaporean government statistics. It is expected that
the figure will reach US$190 million to US$200 million for the entire
year.</P>
      <P>At present, Taiwan businessmen's investment in Singapore is
focused on the electronics and banking industries.</P>
      <P>As of the end of last year, Taiwan businessmen's total direct
investment in Singapore had reached US$900 million to US$1 billion,
with the figure expected to rise to US$1.1 billion to US$1.2 billion
after this year's total is factored in, the statistics show.</P>

anything he does, except perhaps in archery. But even then, when he
wins he courteously makes his bow before he advances to take his
place among the winners; and, when he has lost, he walks down and
drinks his cup of forfeit. Thus, even in this case of competition, he
shows himself to be a gentleman."</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>KMT HEAVYWEIGHT CONTINUES FACT-FINDING TRIP TO MAINLAND CHINA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Xiamen,  Dec.  26  (CNA)
(By Liu Cheng-ching and Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Kuomintang (KMT) heavyweight John Chang
said here Tuesday that the purpose of his ongoing visit in mainland
China is to promote the development of Taiwan-funded companies and to
establish a bridge of communication with related mainland officials.</P>
      <P>Chang, who is a member of the KMT's decision-making Central
Standing Committee but making the visit in his capacity as the
president of a newly formed association to promote the development of
Taiwan business interests in mainland China, said that he hopes his
new organization will be able to consolidate the influence of the 54
Taiwan business associations in the mainland area.</P>
      <P>The former KMT secretary-general and former Republic of China
foreign minister went on to say that bilateral trade is a "very
important link" in the "intricate" cross-Taiwan Strait relations.
Trade can often help forge bilateral contacts in other areas as well,
he added.</P>
      <P>Chang said that his Monday meeting with Wang Daohan, the top
mainland negotiator with Taiwan, gave them an opportunity to exchange
views on the cross-strait situation. According to Chang, both of them
agreed that a breakthrough in bilateral relations will require a
"positive response" from Taiwan on the issue of the "one China"
principle.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, which took place in Shanghai, Wang stressed
that the two sides can "talk about anything" as long as dialogue
takes place under the principle of "one China." However, Chang
responded that the two sides should return to the "one China,
respective interpretations" foundation established in 1992.</P>
      <P>As to the actual significance of the "mini three links" to
cross-strait relations, Wang said that mainland China will continue
to "listen and observe."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chang said that the "mini three links" -- referring to
the direct trade, postal, and transportation links to kickoff between
Taiwan's frontline Kinmen and Matsu islands and designated ports in
mainland China on Jan. 1 -- are "of course" important, but added that
he is personally taking on a more conservative attitude as to whether
the links will actually bring about any breakthroughs.</P>
      <P>Only direct links between Taiwan-proper and mainland China will
be able to resolve concrete issues, Chang said, adding that the two
sides of the strait will then necessarily involve themselves in
direct contact and negotiations.</P>
      <P>Chang said that he is not particularly surprised that mainland
China is not in a hurry to respond to Taiwan's latest olive branch
offering in the form of the mini three links. Likewise, if the mini
links don't lead to the more direct links between Taiwan-proper and
the mainland, this should not be considered unexpected as the two
issues are basically on separate levels, he added.</P>
      <P>Chang is scheduled to visit major industrial zones with a large
Taiwan business presence, including Shanghai, Suzhou, Xiamen,
Shantou, Dongguan, and Zhuhai during his weeklong fact-finding
mission, which began Saturday.</P>
      <P>Attracted by cheap labor and low land costs as well as a common
language and culture, Taiwanese enterprises have poured some US$40
billion into the mainland for various investment projects over the
past decade.</P>
      <P>Chang, a son of late President Chiang Ching-kuo born out of the
wedlock, also visited the mainland earlier this year to pay tribute
to ancestors of the Chiang clan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>COORDINATION CENTER FOR 'MINI THREE LINKS' INAUGURATED IN KINMEN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kinmen,  Dec.  26  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung presided over
the inaugural ceremony of an administrative coordination center for
the "mini three links"-related affairs on the frontline island of
Kinmen Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the ceremony, Chang said the inauguration symbolizes
the start of the direct trade, mail and shipping links between the
Republic of China's defense outposts of Kinmen and Matsu and the
mainland Chinese ports of Xiamen and Fuzhou, better known as
the "mini three links."</P>
      <P>In line with the Offshore Islands Development Act passed by the
Legislative Yuan earlier this year, the government has decided to
formally open the "mini three links" on a trial basis for one
year from Jan. 1, 2001.</P>
      <P>Chang said the opening of the "mini three links" marks a
critical step in the establishment of a peaceful, stable
relationship across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>"It may be just a small step, but it is very important, in the
development of cross-strait relations," Chang stressed, adding: "This
is a historical test, and we cannot afford any flop in implementing
the new opening measures."</P>
      <P>Since its inauguration in May, Chang said, the ROC's new
Democratic Progressive Party-led government has looked forward to
forging friendly relations and dialogue with mainland China.</P>
      <P>"The impending opening of the 'mini three links' will signify
our sincerity and goodwill toward mainland China," Chang explained,
adding the move indicates that the ROC has taken concrete steps,
not just offered lip services, to improve cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>Noting that Kinmen and Matsu has been the ROC's front line with
mainland China for more than half a century, Chang said the opening
of the two defense outposts for direct trade and transport links
with the mainland will mark a very important step toward forging a
peaceful, constructive cross-strait relationship after more than 50
years of rivalry.</P>
      <P>Chang further said as the newly opened coordination center holds
the key to the success of the "mini three links," all staff members
should work hand-in-hand to ensure its smooth operations. The
coordination center is staffed by officials from the Kinmen County
Government and all relevant central government agencies.</P>
      <P>Chang was accompanied by Cabinet Secretary-General Chiou I-jen,
Defense Minister Wu Shih-wen, Interior Minister Chang Po-ya,
Transportation and Communications Minister Yeh Chu-lan, Mainland
Affairs Council Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen, Council of Agriculture
Chairman Chen Hsi-huang and Government Information Office

    <HEADLINE>NOVEMBER JOBLESS RATE HIGHEST SINCE 1985</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 26 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's jobless rate reached 3.22 percent
in November, the highest level for November since 1985, statistics
released Tuesday by the Directorate General of the Budget,
Accounting, and Statistics (DGBAS) showed.</P>
      <P>DGBAS officials said the jobless rate over the first 11 months of
2000 averaged 2.97 percent. They estimated the average jobless rate
for the whole year will be around 3 percent and will reach 4 percent
after Taiwan joins the World Trade Organization.</P>
      <P>Other factors besides WTO entry that may increase Taiwan's
unemployment rate include a slowdown in the U.S. economy, which is
the largest market for Taiwan exports, along with the transformation
of the local industrial structure and the exodus of Taiwan industries
overseas, the officials said.</P>
      <P>Statistics showed that Taiwan's total employment reached 9.54
million in November, up 24,000 from the previous month, while the
number of jobless hit 319,000, up 6,000 from the previous month.</P>
      <P>The 319,000 jobless in November and the 152,000 hidden jobless
represent a serious situation in the local employment market. The
number of hidden jobless, referring to those who are unemployed but
are not seeking employment at the present, increased by 2,000 from
the previous month, representing the sixth consecutive month increase
in this figure.</P>
      <P>DGBAS officials attributed the high jobless rate in November to
the economic slowdown, saying that the closing and scaling down of
businesses has resulted in 5,000 newly unemployed. They added that an
additional 3,000 people became unemployed during the month due to
their temporary jobs ending, and 1,000 people became jobless after
quitting their employment due to job dissatisfaction.</P>
      <P>The officials said that those who became jobless because
businesses scaled back or closed reached 98,000 in November,
increasing by 5,000 from the previous month and setting a record
high.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  26  (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's online job seekers continue to
look for employment in the Internet industry despite an overall
reduction in job opportunities, according to a report released
Tuesday by Taiwan's largest Internet-based manpower resource company.</P>
      <P>The 104 Corporation, whose website allows businesses and job
seekers to match up based on each other's needs, announced that the
company saw a continued increase in the number of people looking for
employment in the online industry.</P>
      <P>According to the company's statistics, November saw a 6.29
percent increase over the previous month in the number of people who
applied for WWW-based jobs on the 104 website, making jobs in the
online industry the most sought-after by employment seekers at the
site.</P>
      <P>At the same time, jobs in the education sector also exhibited
considerable growth in demand, suggesting that job seekers are either
focusing on securing employment in fields that show characteristics
for potential growth or that have long stood for long-term stability,
the report added.</P>
      <P>However, the report also indicated that the ratio of the number
of jobs offered to the number of job seekers on the 104 website
decreased from 1.02 in October to 0.9 opportunities per applicant in
November.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the government announced Tuesday that Taiwan's
unemployment rate for November hit 3.22 percent, the highest level
for that month since 1985.</P>
      <P>Political turmoil, along with a lackluster year in the global
economy and for local businesses, has pushed investor and market
confidence to all-time low levels. Local economic growth has been
widely predicted to remain slow at least until the second quarter of
2001.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FISHING INDUSTRY CRITICIZES STUDY ON TOXIC LEVELS IN FISH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  26  (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's top fisheries administrator and
fishing industry representatives on Tuesday criticized a study on the
toxic levels of various types of fish sold on the market, citing
excessively high standards used during the research.</P>
      <P>Hu Hsing-hua, director of the Fisheries Administration under the
Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture, said that the Australian
standard adopted by the Environmental Quality Protection Foundation
(EQPF) in lieu of an established domestic standard was 1,600 times
stricter than the world standard used by the United States and the
United Nations.</P>
      <P>The EQPF, which funded the research, announced Saturday that 14
out of 30 types of fish purchased in September from supermarkets and
traditional markets in the greater Hsingchu area in northern Taiwan
contained "excessive" amounts of persistent organic pollutants (POPs)
despite the fact that numerous types of POPs have long been banned in
the country.</P>
      <P>The foundation also announced that four of the 14 types of fish
showed traces of organochlorine pesticides exceeding "international
standards."</P>
      <P>POPs are synthetic chemicals such as DDT, endrin, mirex, and
aldrin, which are linked to cancer, birth defects, and developmental
problems. They break down in the environment extremely slowly, travel
thousands of miles in the air and water, and are extremely toxic to
wildlife and humans.</P>
      <P>Due to the persistency of these compounds and the quantity used
years ago -- ironically, for the purpose of controlling disease,
increasing food production, and improving the standard of living --
they are still prevalent in different environmental matrices such as
soil, sediment, and biota.</P>
      <P>According to Taipei Fish Products Marketing Corp. President Huang
Yung-hsin, consumer spending on fish products has plummeted
approximately 30 percent from the usual figures since the EQPF
announcement.</P>
      <P>The daily total tonnage of fish products sold over the past few
days has decreased by 20 to 30 metric tons, drawing anxious
complaints from fishermen in all affected areas, Huang said.</P>
      <P>He added that consumers have obviously become afraid of the types
of fish marked by the foundation as being contaminated -- including
such local dinner table favorites as milkfish, hairtail, salmon,
golden threads, and threestripe tigerfish.</P>
      <P>National Tsinghua University chemistry professor Ling Yung-chien,
who conducted the research, admitted that the results of his study
may adversely affect the livelihood of the country's fishermen in the
short term.</P>
      <P>However, he went on to say that in the long run, if Taiwan can
take the opportunity to establish a set of standards, thereby making
Taiwan fish stocks more trustworthy on the market, then this could
turn out instead to be a boon for fishermen. This is particularly
important considering the predicted influx of imported fish products
competing for local market share after Taiwan's impending World Trade
Organization entry, he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AIR FORCE TO CONSOLIDATE NEW WARPLANE COMBAT CAPABILITY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  26 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China Air Force will step
up consolidation of beyond-the-vision combat capabilities of its
second-generation warplanes starting next year, Ministry of National
Defense spokesman Huang Suey-sheng said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Huang said the Air Force has commissioned many second-generation
warplanes into service this year, including a second wing of the
locally developed Ching-kuo Indigenous Defense Fighters (IDFs), five
squadrons of the U.S.-made F-16 jet fighters and two
squadrons of the French-built Mirage 2000-5 jet fighters.</P>
      <P>In the coming year, Huang said, the Air Force will focus on
integration and consolidation of beyond-the-vision or hit-and-run
combat capabilities of all these three types of new-generation
warplanes to ensure its air supremacy over the Taiwan Strait in the
face of mainland China's mounting military threat.</P>
      <P>Huang said the Air Force also plans to purchase even more
advanced stealth warplanes that can conduct short-range or vertical
takeoffs and long-range precision targeting at several different
targets simultaneously.</P>
      <P>In view of Beijing's intensified military modernization plan,
Huang said, the ROC Air Force will develop a multi-dimensional,
multi-sorties air defense strategy characterized by the use of
multi-types of warplanes.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, Huang went on, all Air Force pilots must
also undergo mixed warplanes tactical training in order to
effectively integrate all new-generation weaponry systems and beef up
their overall combat capabilities.</P>
      <P>Over the past year, Huang said, Air Force pilots have received
training in firing of air-to-air and air-to-surface missiles. "and
in the new year, they will receive intensive training in integrating
different weaponry systems and upgrading performance," Huang said,
adding that all these training programs are designed to help
realize the ROC's ultimate military goal of deterring
its enemy from launching any attack on Taiwan.</P>
      <P>As part of its efforts to resolve pilot shortage problems, Huang
said, the Air Force has opened "professional pilots" classes
to cultivate new pilots. In addition, he said, the Air Force has
also offered special financial incentives to encourage active-duty
pilots to postpone their retirement plans.</P>
      <P>The ROC Air Force has taken delivery of 130 IDFs, 60 Mirage
2000-5s and more than 100 F-16s in the past few years. As a result,
it must accelerate training of more qualified pilots to operate so
many second-generation warplanes.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TIME TO DISCUSS RE-REGISTRATION TOO EARLY: TAIPEI MAYOR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 26 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou said Tuesday that
it is still too early to discuss who has yet to re-register with the
Kuomintang (KMT).</P>
      <P>Ma, who is also a member of the KMT Central Standing Committee,
made the remarks when asked his views about several close aides of
former President Lee Teng-hui who have yet to re-register with the
party.</P>
      <P>Local reports said the close aides, namely former party
secretary-general, Huang Kuen-huei; former party spokesman, Huang
Hwei-chen; former chief of the party business management committee,
Liu Tai-ying; and former Minister of the Interior Huang Chu-wen, were
considering forming a new political party and even cooperating with
the Democratic Progressive Party.</P>
      <P>Ma said that the deadline for the re-registration, which the KMT
launched to solidify its support base after finishing a distant third
in the March presidential election despite boasting a membership of
over two million, has been postponed until January 31, adding that it
is still too early to discuss who has not re-registered.</P>
      <P>He said reports about Lee's cronies possibly forming a new
political party could only be "rumors," pointing out that the KMT
could not afford to splinter even when it was a ruling party and now
that it has become an opposition party and its support and popularity
have slipped dramatically, members of the KMT will have no room to
thrive after leaving the party.</P>
      <P>Ma also said that if some KMT members want to cooperate with
other political parties, they are free to do so, but he added that
they would not be successful if they wanted to unite with the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party since the DPP administration has shown
the poorest performance of any of Taiwan's past governments.</P>
      <P>Ma reiterated that the KMT should not cooperate with the DPP
because the latter has different ideals, adding that it is better
that a big and a small party cooperate so as not to squeeze the
maneuvering space for an opposition party to monitor the government.</P>
      <P>Ma, who has completed two years as Taipei mayor and who has vowed
to run for reelection, said that he welcomes outstanding people from
other parties to come forward to run in the mayoral race, saying that
it would be good news for Taipei citizens.</P>
      <P>Reports have said that Shen Fu-hsiung of the ruling DPP, Lee
Ching-an of the People First Party, and former KMT spokesman Huang
Hwei-chen may take part in the race.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CPC LIKELY TO CUT OIL PRICES BEFORE CHINESE NEW YEAR DAY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  26  (CNA)
(By David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>It is highly possible that the Chinese
Petroleum Corp. (CPC) will lower its oil products prices between Jan.
1 and Chinese New Year day on Jan. 24, a CPC source said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>It is the decline in international oil prices that have led the
CPC to consider lowering its oil products prices, the source said.</P>
      <P>If international oil prices remain stable and the NT dollar does
not drop in value against the US dollar after Jan. 1, then the CPC
most likely will lower its oil products prices before Chinese New
Year day.</P>
      <P>International oil price rises climaxed in mid-November when crude
oil reached a cost of US$35.45 per barrel. The price then declined
for over a month before stabilizing at US$25 per barrel before
Christmas.</P>
      <P>The CPC last adjusted oil prices on Nov. 3, with an average
reduction of 2.32 percent for the different kinds of oil products.</P>
      <P>The new wholesale price for the CPC's 98 octane unleaded gasoline
will be NT$18.617 per liter, and the new wholesale price for its
premium diesel will be NT$13.2227 per liter, according to the CPC
source.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  26 (CNA)
(By Edward Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The general syndicate indices of Taiwan's
economic prospects in November registered at 91.56 points, a decline
of 3.56 points from October's level, representing the fourth
consecutive month of decline, the Taiwan Institute of Economic
Research announced Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Wu Rong-I, president of TIER, said that, due to the fact that a
great majority of manufacturers and traders have an optimistic view
of the future of Taiwan's economy, he believes the island's economy
may have a chance of turning for the better in the second quarter of
2001.</P>
      <P>Mentioning Taiwan's escalating unemployment rate, Wu explained
that a rate of around 3 percent is still acceptable as the island is
facing an era of industrial restructuring.</P>
      <P>In order to deal with the coming of a new economic era, the
government agencies concerned should amend the 1984 Labor Basic Law
as soon as possible, Wu said, adding that flexibility in the number
of working hours will help both laborers and investors improve
relations and working efficiency.</P>
      <P>The results of surveys conducted by the TIER showed that the
ratio of respondents who said they believe Taiwan's economic
prospects will turn for the better in the second quarter of 2001
increased from 18 percent last month to 21.7 percent this month.</P>
      <P>At the same time, the percentage of respondents who said they
believe Taiwan's economic prospects will remain the same in the next
month decreased to 40.7 percent from 48.8 percent last month. The
percentage of respondents who said they feel economic prospects will
turn for the worse increased to 37.6 percent this month from 33.2
percent last month.</P>
      <P>Wu suggested that the government adopt an economic policy of
moderate expansion and expand domestic demand in order to cope with
projected declines in economic growth for next year.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 26 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei enjoyed the highest cyber population
among all major cities in Taiwan, Hong Kong and mainland China in the
fourth quarter of 2000, a local newspaper has reported.</P>
      <P>Citing an investigation by an Hong Kong-based Internet survey
company -- iamasia -- the Commercial Times said Taipei takes first
place with 46.4 percent of its residents wired, leading all other
cities in the three Chinese societies. But it pointed out that
Beijing and Shenzhen are quickly coming from behind with a percentage
of 32 percent each.</P>
      <P>In terms of overall Internet connection rate, Hong Kong takes the
first spot with a rate of 37 percent, ahead of Taiwan's 33 percent
and mainland China's 7 percent, it added.</P>
      <P>However, mainland China's cyber population has grown fast -- from
12 million in July to the current level of 15 million -- an
indication that the mainland is a potential market for Internet
businesses, according to the report.</P>
      <P>At present, Beijing, Shenzhen and Guangzhou have the highest
percentages of Internet connection in mainland China, while Shanghai,
Shenyang and Wuhan register the largest growth in the number of
Internet users.</P>
      <P>Judging from the average number of pages viewed by Internet users
in those cities, mainland Chinese users read an average 46 web pages
each month, a level much higher than the 24 pages visited by Taiwan
and Hong Kong users, it noted, adding that this is a reflection of
the "in-depth reading habits" of mainland Chinese users.</P>
      <P>According to the report, nearly 86 percent of the people surveyed
contend that Taiwan has the upper hand over mainland China in the
Internet Industry at the current stage, while only 40 percent of them
think that Taiwan will maintain its edge over the next three years.</P>
      <P>At the same time, about 83 percent of the respondents are of the
opinion that Taiwan and the mainland are complementary to one another

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN'S IT HARDWARE PRODUCTION RANKS FOURTH IN WORLD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  26  (CNA)
(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's domestic information technology
(IT) hardware production this year is estimated at US$23.081 billion,
the Market Information Center of the Information Industry Institute
(III) announced Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The figure represents a 9.8 percent increase over last year's
figure but means that Taiwan slips to fourth in the world behind the
United States' US$88.4 billion, Japan's US$45.4 billion and mainland
China's US$25.335 billion.</P>
      <P>Last year, Taiwan ranked third in IT hardware production, but
local firms contributed greatly to the increase in mainland China's
production this year because in many cases, these firms received
their orders in Taiwan but actually exported the products from
mainland China.</P>
      <P>If production by local companies with factories outside Taiwan
were included, Taiwan's total IT hardware for 2000 would amount to
US$47.019 billion, up 17.9 percent from the preceding year.</P>
      <P>An III official estimated that Taiwan's domestic and overseas IT
hardware production will go up 14.9 percent to US$54.031 billion in
2001, up 9 percent to US$58.886 billion in 2002 and up 7.3 percent to
US$63.167 billion in 2003.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's global share of the notebook computers market this year
is estimated to stand at 52.5 percent, short of the expected 60
percent share target, although the III official said that the 60
percent share target might be attained in 2002.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LEGISLATURE TO CONTINUE DISCUSSION ON WORKWEEK HOURS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  26  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Lawmakers will continue to discuss the
controversial workweek issue Thursday after a long day of debating
the subject ended Tuesday in stalemate, according to He Chi-huei, the
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) whip.</P>
      <P>If there is still no consensus reached, then the KMT, which is
the dominant party in the 220-seat legislature, will force a vote on
the scheme, he said.</P>
      <P>The opposition alliance in the legislature held intensive
consultations with labor and management representatives Tuesday and
although it was agreed that the 84-hour bi-weekly workweek will be
the basis of any consensus, there were differences over matching
measures to be used to implement the scheme.</P>
      <P>To cushion the possible impact of the shortened workweek, there
will be a one-year grace period during which management and labor
will have to agree on a flexible workweek so long as it has the
consent of the labor unions or two-thirds of the laborers, according
to an agreement reached between the opposition alliance and the labor
representatives.</P>
      <P>After the grace period, the 84-hour bi-weekly workweek will be
implemented all across the board.</P>
      <P>However, the agreement met with opposition from management
representatives, who said that the threshold of an agreement between
management and labor should not be as high as two-thirds, adding that
all agreements between labor and management should have a 50 percent
threshold.</P>
      <P>The management representatives also opposed the one-year grace
period and sought to have it extended to 18 months, an idea the
opposition alliance said is unacceptable.</P>
      <P>Hsu Tien-tsai, party whip of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP), said earlier that the DPP agreed in principle with the
workweek scheme, but added that as some businesses have no labor
unions and the establishment of such unions will take about three
months, he and Chen Chu, chairwoman of the Council of Labor Affairs,
have suggested that the consent of the labor unions be replaced by
the consent of more than half of the laborers.</P>
      <P>The shortened workweek, due to be implemented Jan. 1, has been
the focus of national debate as it comes at a time when unemployment
continues to rise on the island due to the economic slowdown.</P>
      <P>The controversy over the issue results from the retaliation of
the opposition alliance, which resented the minority DPP for not
consulting with them first and taking sole credit for taking care of
the island's laborers, when it proposed the 44-hour workweek as one
of President Chen Shui-bian's campaign promises.</P>
      <P>The opposition alliance then proposed the even more generous idea
of an 84-hour bi-weekly scheme, which is due to be implemented Jan.
1, but the scheme also puts the alliance in a dilemma, as it wants to
offend neither the island's laborers nor its managers.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT CHEN VOWS TO NORMALIZE CROSS-STRAIT TRADE TIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Tainan,  Taiwan,  Dec.  26  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said
Tuesday he will do his utmost to push for normalization of trade and
economic relations across the Taiwan Strait with a view to sustaining
Taiwan's industrial and overall economic development.</P>
      <P>Chen made the pledge during a visit to UNI-President Enterprises
Corp. in the southern Taiwan county of Tainan.</P>
      <P>Noting that economy is Taiwan's lifeline, President Chen said
his administration has consistently attached great importance to
problems faced by local industries.</P>
      <P>"We'll squarely face problems and adjust our policies in the
direction that will benefit local enterprises and help cultivate a
better business and investment climate," Chen stressed.</P>
      <P>As many industry heavyweights have been urging the government to
forge direct trade, mail and transport links with mainland China,
also known as "big three links," and eased restrictions on mainland
China-bound investments, Chen said his administration will take
positive steps to facilitate normalization of cross-strait trade and
economic ties.</P>
      <P>"Since normalization of trade ties is the first step toward
normalization of full-fledged cross-strait relations, the government
will tackle cross-strait issues from the angle that will benefit our
economic development and business expansion," the president
explained.</P>
      <P>He lauded UNI-President Enterprises for its continued efforts to
upgrade product quality and management system. "The company's
experience tells us that there is no sunset industry. There is just
'sunset management' and 'sunset products,'" he remarked.</P>
      <P>UNI-President Enterprises is one of Taiwan's leading food
processor and manufacturer of many other consumer goods. In recent
years, it has managed to diversify into many other new fields,
including high-tech industries, by forming strategic alliances with
foreign partners or through merger and acquisition. Under its
diversification and globalization strategies, the group has
successfully expanded its business empire into mainland China, North
America and Southeast Asia.</P>
      <P>President Chen said the UNI-President Enterprises group has
provided a good example for local traditional industries to
transform themselves to meet new challenges and stay competitive in
the global market.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chen said his administration, while pushing for the
development of knowledge-based economy, will also not let
traditional industries feel lonely and will instead actively help
them overcome difficulties and survive ever-increasing
foreign competition.</P>
      <P>"The government will provide support and service for local
industries and improve the general investment climate by removing
non-economic barriers so that they can pursue innovation and
transformation," Chen pledged.</P>
      <P>Later in the day, Chen visited Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing
Corp.'s (TSMC's) new 12" wafer plant in the Tainan Science-based
Industrial Park, which is also Taiwan's first 12" wafer production
facility.</P>
      <P>Chen witnessed the production of the first batch of 12" (300mm)
wafer products ever churned out in Taiwan. "It marks a new
milestone in Taiwan's memory chip foundry service. I'm glad to
witness this great moment," he said emotionally.</P>
      <P>TSMC Chairman Morris Chang presented a piece of the newly
produced 12" wafer to Chen as a gift. Chang also reaffirmed TSMC's
commitment to make continued investments in Taiwan. TSMC is the
world's largest microchip foundry service.</P>
      <P>President Chen also assured Chang that the government will place
its top priority on improving the island's investment climate to
attract more blue-chip companies to continue expanding their business
in Taiwan to help upgrade the country's overall competitiveness and
develop Taiwan into a "green silicon island."</P>

    <HEADLINE>FOUNDATION APOLOGIZES FOR TOXIC FISH REPORT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Dec.   26   (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The private Environmental Quality
Protection Foundation (EQPF) apologized Tuesday to Taiwan's fishing
industry for publicizing a study on the toxin levels of various types
of fish sold in local markets.</P>
      <P>EQPF Secretary-General Liu Ming-lung apologized to the country's
fishermen for making public the report, which has caused fish markets
islandwide to nosedive over the last three days -- a result
completely unexpected when the study was first ordered to be
conducted.</P>
      <P>The EQPF, which funded the study, announced Saturday that 14 out
of 30 types of fish marketed in supermarkets and traditional markets
in the greater Hsinchu area in northern Taiwan in September were
found to contain "excessive" amounts of persistent organic pollutants
(POPs) despite the fact that numerous types of POPs have long been
banned in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The foundation also announced that four of the 14 types of fish
showed traces of organochlorine pesticides exceeding "international
standards."</P>
      <P>POPs are synthetic chemicals such as DDT, endrin, mirex and
aldrin, which are linked to cancer, birth defects and developmental
problems.</P>
      <P>The chemicals break down in the environment extremely slowly,
travel thousands of miles in the air and water, and are extremely
toxic to wildlife and humans, said National Tsinghua University
chemistry professor Ling Yung-chien, who conducted the study.</P>
      <P>According to the Taipei Fish Products Marketing Corp., sales of
fish products have plummeted approximately 30 percent from the usual
figures since the EQPF announcement.</P>
      <P>The company added that consumers have obviously been frightened
by the report, which notes that certain kinds of fish tested,
including salmon, milkfish, hairtail and three-stripe tigerfish, were
chemically contaminated.</P>
      <P>Liu stressed that the announcement of the study results were not
meant to batter the fishing industry but to remind Taiwan people that
organic pollution of the environment is a global concern.</P>
      <P>Consumers' rights are equally important to those of the
fishermen, he noted.</P>
      <P>Discounting Liu and Ling's opinions, representatives of the
fishing industry claimed that the EQPF announcement of the study was
"too coarse and reckless and the sampling and standards applied in
the study were questionable."</P>
      <P>According to Hu Hsing-hua, director of the Fisheries
Administration under the Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture, the
Australian standard adopted by the EQPF in lieu of an established
domestic standard was 1,600 times stricter than the world standard
used by the United States and the United Nations.</P>
      <P>The foundation and the professor should compensate for the losses
that the study has incurred to the island's fishermen, the
representatives said.</P>

      <P>From January, Taiwan will completely remove
a cap on foreign investment in companies listed on Taiwan's stock
market, Vice Premier Lai In-jaw announced Tuesday.</P>
      <P>At present, each foreign financial institution is allowed to hold

also cannot exceed 75 percent, according to Vice Finance Minister Lin

      <P>The liberalization plan will be applicable to all industries,
excluding companies involved in post, telecommunications, public
utilities, inland transportation or national defense-related
businesses, Lin noted.</P>
      <P>At present, no foreign financial institutions hold a stake of

Tuesday allowed an additional 1,291 items of mainland Chinese
products to enter Kinmen and Matsu to cope with the start of the

      <P>The BOFT decided to ease the control on imports of more mainland

difficult to crack down on cross-strait smuggling in the areas, which

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's trade with mainland China
registered the 13th consecutive month of double-digit growth as of
October, according to statistics published Tuesday by the Board of
Foreign Trade (BOFT).</P>
      <P>The statistics show that Taiwan exported products worth US$2.35
billion to the mainland in October, up 15.6 percent over the same
month of last year and accounting for 17.2 percent of Taiwan's total
exports for the month.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's imports from the mainland in October totaled US$566
million, an increase of 29.9 percent over the same month of last year
and accounting for 4 percent of Taiwan's total imports in this
period.</P>

billion during the period from January to October, an increase of
29.6 percent over the same period of last year and accounting for
11.2 percent of Taiwan's total trade.</P>
      <P>BOFT officials attributed the continued prospering trade between
the two sides of the Taiwan Strait to the economic recovery of Asian
countries after the 1997 financial crisis and to global economic
growth.</P>
      <P>However, they warned that as America's economic growth has

it the General Political Warfare Bureau (GPWB), Vice Minister of
National Defense Chen Pi-chao said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chen made the announcement while attending a public hearing held
by Legislator Chang Shih-liang on the review of the armed forces'
general political warfare system.</P>
      <P>Chen said the streamlining of the GPWD is in accordance with the
newly passed Organization Law of the MND and added that the MND also
plans to further streamline the GPWB and rename it again, this time
as the Political Warfare Bureau (PWB), within three years in
accordance with the nation's Ten-Year Troop Reduction Plan.</P>
      <P>The Republic of China Armed Forces' political warfare system has
its origins in the commissar system of the former Soviet Union's
armed forces. Its functions are to maintain the armed forces'
security, crack down on irregularities, engage in psychological
warfare and provide military personnel with psychological guidance.</P>
      <P>Chen said that the GPWD will be headed by a three-star general,
squashing earlier speculation that the top-ranking department
official would be a lieutenant-general.</P>

    <HEADLINE>11 MAINLANDERS NABBED TRYING TO ENTER TAIWAN ILLEGALLY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Pingtung,   Dec.   27  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Eleven mainland Chinese citizens
attempting to enter Taiwan illegally were nabbed by police soon after
landing on the shores of Taiwan's southernmost county of Pingtung.</P>
      <P>Police had found out beforehand about the mainlanders' scheduled
rendezvous with a blue van that was supposed to pick them up and take
them to safety after they had landed ashore in Pingtung.</P>
      <P>Pingtung maritime police therefore arranged to have an identical
van arrive at the previously arranged spot on the coast a little
earlier than the scheduled meeting time.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately for the 11 mainlanders from Pingtan, Fujian
Province, they were unaware of the police foreknowledge of their
scheduled landing and were nabbed when they came out of hiding and
approached the van which they thought was their ride.</P>
      <P>The 11 mainlanders, most of them young men, said they had each
paid an unnamed "snake head" between 30,000-35,000 renminbi in order
to be transported to the island and picked up upon arrival before
being "dispersed" into Taiwan society "like instant milk powder into
water."</P>

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairwoman
Tsai Ing-wen on Wednesday urged authorities from both sides of the
Taiwan Strait to give more thought and attention to people's needs
when cross-strait relations are concerned.</P>
      <P>Fielding questions at the Legislative Yuan, Tsai said both the
leadership in Taiwan and mainland China should bear the
responsibility of meeting the needs of their people and "should also
have the wisdom" to do so.</P>
      <P>Tsai made the remarks when asked by Democratic Progressive Party
Legislator Wang Tuo what her opinion was concerning the fact that
mainland Chinese authorities have been taking an uncooperative
attitude toward Taiwan's approach via the "mini three links," set to
kick off Jan. 1.</P>
      <P>The "mini three links," referring to direct trade, mail, and
shipping links between Taiwan's frontline islands of Kinmen and Matsu
and mainland China's Xiamen and Fuzhou, both in Fujian Province, is
designed as a goodwill gesture toward mainland China, as well as a
project to help revitalize economic development on the two offshore
islands.</P>
      <P>Wang criticized the "mini three links" as not being significant
and as only being a program that legalizes cross-strait activities
that had previously been carried out illicitly.</P>
      <P>Tsai argued that the program is primarily aimed at helping create
new business opportunities on Kinmen and Matsu and consequently
bettering the economies of the two offshore counties.</P>
      <P>During the interpellation session, Legislator Chen Ken-teh from
the major opposition Kuomintang blasted the government for its
inability to do anything even about Beijing turning a deaf ear to the
"mini three links" initiative and also rejecting an application for
entry by Legislative Yuan Transportation Committee members, who had
planned to take a trial sailing from Kinmen to Xiamen on Dec. 28
before the mini links go into effect at the start of the new year.</P>
      <P>Chen said he is very concerned about what the government will be
able to do if anything goes wrong after the "mini three links" are
unilaterally implemented under circumstances where there has been no
consultations nor agreement between the two sides on the issue.</P>

    <HEADLINE>COAST GUARD SENDS MORE PATROL SHIPS TO MATSU ON EVE OF MINI LINKS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  27  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The National Coast Guard Administration
(NCGA) said Wednesday it has sent three additional patrol ships to
assist in patrol missions in the Matsu area in preparation for the
impending opening of the direct "mini three links."</P>
      <P>NCGA officials said the administration has taken the measure
after three NCGA patrol vessels spotted a mainland fishing boat
intruding into waters near the Republic of China's frontline island
Tuesday evening in a suspected attempt to sell fishery and
agricultural products.</P>
      <P>The mainland ship first defied the NCGA officers' order to stop
for inspection and instead used its stern to hit one of the ROC
patrol vessels. In the stand-off, ROC coast guard officers fired 16
warning shots and the mainland boat finally halted its
fight.</P>
      <P>Later on, the mainland boat, identified as the Minlianyu
F-1008, sank into waters due to cracks in its hull and all of its
six crew members were taken to the ROC's coast guard patrol vessels.
The crew members have been taken into custody for further
questioning and prosecution in Matsu, which lies closer to mainland
China's Fujian province than to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chung Tung-sheng, director of the NCGA's maritime patrol bureau,
said he feels regret over the incident. He urged people on both
sides of the Taiwan Strait not to break any law at this critical
moment as the NCGA has completed preparations, including tightening
security measures, for the Jan. 1 opening of direct trade, mail and
shipping links between the ROC's defense outposts of Kinmen/Matsu and
mainland China's Xiamen/Fuzhou, commonly known as the "mini three
links."</P>
      <P>Chung said the NCGA will intensify patrols in the Kinmen
and Matsu areas to ensure safe voyages and thwart
cross-strait criminal activities after the opening of the
"mini three links."</P>

    <DATELINE>Kinmen,   Dec.   27  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
Legislator Chien Hsi-chieh on Wednesday urged Beijing to cooperate in
helping bring about reunion between family members separated for over
five decades because of civil war across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>On the eve of the Republic of China's landmark "mini three links"
initiative, Chien called on Beijing authorities to consider things
from a humanitarian standpoint and be cooperative in helping mainland
Chinese citizens be reunited with family members living on Kinmen.</P>
      <P>He said it is hoped that long-separated family members, most of
them older citizens aged above 65, will be allowed to return to their
Kinmen homes aboard the first vessel sailing across the strait to
mainland China's Xiamen when it makes the return voyage to Kinmen the
same day on Jan. 1 when the "mini three links" kick off.</P>
      <P>Chien blasted Beijing's cold shoulder to Taiwan's initiative of
the "mini three links," referring to direct postal, transportation,
and trade links between Taiwan's frontline islands of Matsu and
Kinmen and mainland China's Xiamen and Fuzhou, set to kick off at the
start of the new year.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chien, executive director of the civil group Taiwan
Peace Promotion Foundation, announced that the group will sponsor a
"Fireworks of Peace" to be set off simultaneously on Kinmen and
Xiamen next Aug. 23 in remembrance of the artillery bombardment of
Kinmen in 1958 and to celebrate the peaceful reconciliation between
Kinmen and mainland China in 2001.</P>
      <P>Kinmen was the only place where actual cross-strait military
confrontation broke out during the last five decades. For many years
after gaining control of the Chinese mainland in 1949, the Chinese
communists sought to "liberate" Taiwan by force. Beginning in the
early 1950s, the Chinese communists launched a series of military
attacks against areas controlled by the ROC government in an effort
to achieve reunification by force.</P>
      <P>The artillery bombardment and attempted invasion of Kinmen in
1958 is one of the most well-known of these incidents. After days of
artillery and aerial bombardment and attempted landings by its
amphibious forces, communist China failed to take the island. Since
then, it has not attempted to carry out a military attack on Kinmen
again.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  27  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A senior mainland affairs official said
Wednesday he foresees a very low probability that a military
conflict breaks out in the Kinmen-Matsu area after the opening of
the direct "mini three links."</P>
      <P>Lin Chong-pin, vice chairman of the Cabinet-level Mainland
Affairs Council, which charts Taiwan's policy toward the mainland,
made the remarks in response to an interpellation by
opposition legislators at a Legislative Yuan committee meeting that
military conflicts might erupt in the KInmen-Matsu area following the
opening of the direct "mini three links" on Jan. 1, 2001.</P>
      <P>In line with the Offshore Islands Development Act passed by the
Legislative Yuan earlier this year, the Republic of China government
has decided to formally open direct trade, mail and shipping links
between its defense outposts of Kinmen/Matsu and mainland
China's Xiamen/Fuzhou, commonly known as the "mini three links," on a
trial basis from the beginning of the new year.</P>
      <P>Lin said mainland China has consistently adopted a "cold
treatment" strategy to cope with the ROC's "mini three links" plan.</P>
      <P>In fact, Lin said, mainland China has taken a double-edged
tactic toward Taiwan since the new ROC government was inaugurated
in May. "On the one hand, mainland China has softened its bellicose
rhetoric in an effort to win Taiwan people's hearts, and on the
other, it has persistently pressured us to embrace its 'one China'
as a precondition for resuming bilateral dialogue," Lin explained.</P>
      <P>He further said although Beijing has refused to discuss with
Taiwan any issues regarding the "mini three links," it is unlikely
to take an provocative action to spark a military conflict in waters
surrounding the ROC-held frontline islands of Kinmen and Matsu,
both of which lie closer to the mainland than to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Quoting Premier Chang Chun-hsiung, Lin said the impending
opening of the "mini three links" marks a goodwill gesture to
mainland China.</P>
      <P>"We hope to express our sincerity and goodwill toward the
mainland by opening the 'mini three link,'" Lin said, adding that
the ROC looks forward to seeing the "mini three links" proceed
smoothly and thus help pave the way for constructive interaction and
resumption of dialogue of between the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC PRESIDENT NAMED `TRENDIEST COMMODITY CONCEPT'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 27 (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian
was the "trendiest commodity concept" of 2000, according to a report
on Taiwan's top 10 products of the year.</P>
      <P>The other nine concepts, published in the most recent issue
Business Weekly, a local magazine, are trips to Shanghai, personal
digital assistants (PDAs), a local television drama series, health
spas and clubs, Internet cafes, king penguins, DVD players, digital
cameras and South Park paraphernalia.</P>
      <P>The items are evaluated and selected annually by a board of 10
local experts and scholars in consumer behavior and advertising.</P>
      <P>According to the panel, trends reflect the nation's social
psychology, and this year's list reflects the months of political
upheavals and the subsequent need for the public to relieve
themselves of the stress that came from coping with the changes.</P>
      <P>Chen's likeness has been heavily marketed by local businesses in
the form of print and television commercials, stuffed dolls and other
spin-offs, due to the "political star" status he received in being
the first opposition leader to become president, the report says.</P>
      <P>The magazine also notes that Shanghai became the most popular
city to visit, with over 300,000 locals making the trip in 2000.</P>
      <P>In terms of information technology (IT) products, the magazine
indicates that this year saw an increase in the number of IT-related
items making the list, with PDAs taking the lead, suggesting that the
Taiwan public has become more accustomed to high-tech commodities.</P>
      <P>Stress-relief was another hot-selling concept this year, with
spas and health clubs springing up all over the country and parents
taking their children to the zoo to see the new king penguins. A
local television drama and its product spin-offs also reveals the
importance the public places on entertainment, the report adds.</P>
      <P>As for predictions on the possible top 10 products for 2001, a
panelist who studies consumer behavior said that if the country's
economic situation continues to worsen, then the bestsellers may turn
out to be tissue paper, toothpaste, and other essential household
commodities.</P>
      <P>However, another panelist quipped: "At the very least, stress
relief products will become even trendier."</P>

    <HEADLINE>`MINI LINKS' MARK ONSET OF NORMAL CROSS-STRAIT TRADE TIES: PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  27  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Wednesday
that the imminent opening of the "mini three links" will mark the
onset of normalization of trade and economic relations across the
Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks while meeting with a delegation of the
Taiwan-Japanese Relations Research Association, a forum founded 10
years ago by a group of heavyweights in Japan's cultural and academic
communities.</P>
      <P>It was also the first time that Chen had publicly addressed the
"mini three links" issue.</P>
      <P>Chen told his guests that the Republic of China government has
taken the initiative by opening direct trade, mail and shipping links
between its frontline islands of Kinmen and Matsu, and mainland
China's Xiamen and Fuzhou ports, commonly known as the "mini three
links," on a trial basis for one year from Jan. 1.</P>
      <P>"The `mini three links' will not only legalize the long-existing
small-time trade between fishermen on the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait but will also mark an initial step toward normalizing
cross-strait trade and economic ties," Chen explained, adding: "It
may be only a small step in the pursuit of cross-strait peace, but it
is critical to the future development of bilateral commercial
exchanges."</P>
      <P>Chen further said the ROC government will review its policy
toward cross-strait trade based on the principles of reciprocity,
respecting market forces and ensuring Taiwan's security.</P>
      <P>"I think that after the two sides of the Taiwan Strait are
admitted to the World Trade Organization in the near future, they
should further open their markets in line with WTO requirements," the
president observed.</P>
      <P>Chen, who took office in the ROC's first democratic transfer of
power between different political parties in May, pointed out that
the people of Taiwan cherish the historical, ethnic and cultural
backgrounds they share with the people of mainland China.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Chen said that as a popularly elected ROC
president, he must safeguard the country's sovereignty, security and
dignity.</P>
      <P>"Since taking office, I have on many occasions called on the top
leaders on both sides of the strait to exercise wisdom and creativity
to jointly deal with the issue of a `future one China' on the
existing foundations and under the principles of democracy and
parity," Chen stressed.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan is now a pluralistic democratic society, Chen
said the people of Taiwan remain divided over the definition of "one
China."</P>
      <P>"I believe it will take much time for the people of Taiwan to
forge a consensus on this extremely sensitive and complicated
sovereignty issue," Chen told the Japanese visitors.</P>
      <P>He reaffirmed his support for the recommendations presented
recently by an advisory group on cross-strait relations, including
the proviso that any change to Taiwan's present status quo must be
approved by the people of Taiwan through democratic procedures and
that his administration should respond to Beijing's "one China" claim
in accordance with the ROC Constitution.</P>
      <P>Chen further noted that the ROC's first democratic transition of
power ranks 17th in the 2000 "Top 20" news events list compiled by
the Associated Press. "We treasure this democratic achievement, and
we'll certainly be better off because we have full confidence in this
land and its people, history and future."</P>
      <P>Touching on relations with Japan, Chen said the ROC and Japan
should cooperate more closely to cope with the mounting military
threat from mainland China.</P>
      <P>"In the face of Beijing's intensified military build-up, its
ever-increasing military budget and deployment of guided missiles in
its coastal regions, our two countries must share information and
cooperate more closely in the defense field in order to maintain
peace, security and stability in the Taiwan Strait and the entire
Asia-Pacific area," Chen urged.</P>
      <P>He also said the new defense cooperation guidelines signed
between Japan and the United States have deliberately maintained
"strategic ambiguity" as regards the scope of its enforcement.</P>
      <P>"We believe that this arrangement will contribute to safeguarding
the Taiwan Strait's security and stability," Chen added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN JOB MARKET TO CONTINUE WORSENING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 27 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Demand and supply in Taiwan's job market is
likely to continue to worsen in the years ahead, as the country
strives to develop a knowledge-based new economy, according to a
recent government assessment.</P>
      <P>The report by the Cabinet-level Council for Economic Planning and
Development (CEPD) forecasts that gaps in manpower supply in the
local job market will become even wider in the coming six years, with
high-level white collar and grassroots-level blue collar sectors
being the most affected.</P>
      <P>During the 2001-2006 period, there will be an average 20,000
positions for top-level executives, while the labor sector will need
nearly 400,000 grassroots workers, the report says, noting however
that around 9,000 mid-level entrants to the workforce from university
and college each year will be unable to find jobs.</P>
      <P>High-level experts and business managers will be very popular,
with an estimated 21,300 vacancies for such professionals annually in
the coming years, while the largest gap will appear in the market for
grassroots laborers such as fishermen, farmers and vendors, with only
around 71,300 people available to meet an estimated demand for
507,500 such positions each year.</P>
      <P>A local consulting firm described the popularity of those
executives in the 35-45 age group with at least a masters degree as a
stark contrast to those elderly jobless workers aged between 45 and
65 whose unemployment rate, according to the CEPD report, has
increased by an average 16.5 percent each year over the past decade.</P>
      <P>At the same time, the supply of mid-level manpower with
university or college degrees, such as technicians and travel
industry-related workers, will far exceed demand for such positions
in the coming six years, as some 185,200 job seekers will join the
market for such positions, vying for only 176,400 vacancies.</P>

      <P>The stock market plunge has begun to bite
into Taiwan's economy, with November's index of economic indicators,
released Wednesday by the Council of Economic Planning and
Development (CEPD), continuing to drop.</P>
      <P>According to government statistics, November's economy flashed a

scale.</P>
      <P>CEPD Vice Chairman Lee Kao-chao said the yellow-blue light

will continue its downward trend into next year.</P>
      <P>Liang Kuo-yuan, an economics professor at National Tsinghua

    <HEADLINE>CHAOS RESULTS FROM DISRESPECT FOR CONSTITUTION: TAIPEI MAYOR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  27  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou said Wednesday
that the current domestic political instability mainly results from
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP's) failure to respect
the Republic of China Constitution and its "one China" spirit.</P>
      <P>In an interview with a local radio station, Ma said that he could
imagine President Chen Shui-bian's frustrations and feelings when he
complained Tuesday about the opposition's incessant boycotts of his
administration's policy initiatives and work plans.</P>
      <P>"This is a logical result, since President Chen himself won just
39.3 percent of the vote in the presidential election and his party
controls barely one-third of seats in the Legislative Yuan," Ma
observed.</P>
      <P>In his view, Ma went on, Chen should face up to this cold reality
and keep his door open for consultations with opposition parties. "A
minority administration should not come up with policy proposals that
are way off the mainstream public opinion," he pointed out.</P>
      <P>"The DPP's overbearing manner in denying the `one China'
principle and the `dual-head' government system is the primary reason
behind the lingering stand-off between Chen's minority administration
and the opposition-dominated legislature," Ma explained.</P>
      <P>Ma, the brightest political star in the main opposition
Kuomintang (KMT), which ruled Taiwan for 55 years until May 20 and
now still controls more than half of seats in the legislature, said
the KMT should cooperate with the two other main opposition parties
-- the People First Party (PFP) and the New Party (NP) -- to guide
policy formulation and relevant legislation.</P>
      <P>"As both the PFP and the NP are KMT splinter groups, they share
similar concepts and ideals regarding the development of relations
with mainland China and have common views on many other critical
issues, Ma said, adding that the KMT should strengthen cooperation
with the PFP and the NP instead of forging any alliances with the
DPP.</P>
      <P>Ma further said since the three opposition parties jointly
control an absolute majority in the legislature, they should take the
lead in broaching legislative programs and various policy initiatives
to win the trust of the public.</P>
      <P>At the moment, Ma said, the DPP minority government has been
unable to win majority support for its policy proposals, while the
opposition parties have also failed to play a leading role in policy
formulation. "This is the worst scenario. We must end this sad
phenomenon in the coming year," he urged.</P>
      <P>The Harvard-trained mayor further said the scheduled Jan. 1
opening of direct trade, mail and shipping links between the ROC's
frontline islands of Kinman and Matsu, and mainland China's Xiamen
and Fuzhou ports, also known as the "mini three links," has little
strategic significance in view of its small scale.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, he admitted that the "mini three links" mark a
goodwill gesture toward the mainland. As for the opening of
full-fledged cross-strait trade, mail and transport links, or the
"three direct links," Ma said much more time is needed to clear the
way. "For one thing, the `one China' issue must be resolved first,"
he noted, referring to the differing views on either side of the
Taiwan Strait as to the actual meaning of "one China."</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC PREMIER EXPLAINS ECONOMIC, FINANCIAL POLICIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 27 (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Premier Chang Chun-hsiung
explained Taiwan's economic and financial policies in an article
published Wednesday in the Asian Wall Street Journal.</P>
      <P>Chang wrote that Taiwan is undergoing a series of industrial
upgrades and financial sector adjustments, and that a financial
crisis brought on by a high ratio of non-performing bank loans and
predicted by international news media is unlikely to occur.</P>
      <P>Chang went on to say that although there are problems with
impaired assets in some financial institutions, the ROC government is
"closely monitoring the situation" and has taken "appropriate
measures" to establish a sounder financial system and strengthen the
management of financial institutions.</P>
      <P>These measures include encouraging mergers and acquisitions among
financial institutions, promoting the establishment of asset
management companies and lifting a ban on mergers of foreign and
domestic financial institutions.</P>
      <P>Chang also addressed the issue of the upcoming Jan. 1
establishment of the "mini three links" -- direct trade, postal, and
transportation links connecting Kinmen and Matsu islands with the
Chinese mainland. He said that the eventual establishment of the
"three links" connecting the mainland with Taiwan-proper is a "clear
expression of Taiwan's sincerity."</P>
      <P>Chang added that Taiwan will adopt a progressive, step-by-step
policy in dealing with cross-Taiwan Strait trade. However, he said
that Taiwan is willing to make flexible adjustments and prepare for
future cross-strait economic policies as long as the policies enhance
mutual benefits, safeguard national security, ensure Taiwan's
economic advantage, and fulfill World Trade Organization regulations.</P>
      <P>With Taiwan listed as the third-largest foreign investor in
mainland China, Chang said that "a change in comparative advantages
and the relocation of businesses are both natural consequences of the
processes of restructuring and industrial upgrading."</P>
      <P>Because many of Taiwan's businesses are investing in mainland
China to take advantage of low wages and large overseas markets
instead of opting for complete relocation, Chang said that Taiwan is
not facing an "industrial hollowing-out," as some critics have
charged, but rather a "normal adjustment" in the industrial
structure.</P>
      <P>The administration has made the development of a knowledge-based
economy for Taiwan its goal, he said, adding that the government has
already implemented a plan to reach this goal by establishing a
mechanism for stimulating innovation and venture capital.</P>
      <P>The plan also helps lay the foundation for a high-bandwidth
Internet environment and strengthens the application of information
technology, thereby raising Taiwan's overall industrial
competitiveness, he added.</P>
      <P>In recent years, he went on, the people of Taiwan have
demonstrated their creativity by becoming the fourth-largest U.S.
patent holder in the world.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is determined to establish itself as a "green silicon
island that is respected for environmental friendliness, a high
quality of life, and advanced industrial development," he added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China has held a series of
closed-door meetings to discuss the Taiwan-initiated "mini three
links," a senior National Security Bureau (NSB) official said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Fielding questions at a meeting of the Legislative Yuan's Defense
Committee, NSB Deputy Director Han Kun said that although the Beijing
authorities have ostensibly cold-shouldered the initiative, it has
decided not to close the door on the new opening measure as it thinks
the "mini three links" will facilitate its "united front" tactics
against the residents of the Republic of China's frontline islands of
Kinmen and Matsu.</P>
      <P>In line with the Offshore Islands Development Act passed by the
legislature earlier this year, the ROC government is scheduled Jan. 1
to formally open direct trade, mail and shipping links between its
defense outposts of Kinmen and Matsu, and mainland China's Xiamen and
Fuzhou ports, commonly known as the "mini three links," on a trial
basis.</P>
      <P>Han said mainland China has worked hard to win the hearts and
minds of residents of the two islands, both of which lie far closer
to the mainland than to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"The opening of the `mini three links' will make it even easier
for mainland China to court Kinmen and Matsu residents," Han said,
adding that the NSB is worried that the opening of the links will
have a strong impact on the "psychological defenses" of Kinmen and
Matsu residents.</P>
      <P>In view of the geographical proximity between the islands and the
mainland, Han said relevant security agencies have completed
preparations to maintain security, stability and market order in the
two islands.</P>

    <HEADLINE>RUSSIA  MAY  BE  WILLING  TO  STORE  ROC NUCLEAR WASTE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  27 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>With the Russian parliament approving the
first reading of a revised environmental protection law, Taiwan is a
step closer to having some of its nuclear waste shipped to that
country for final disposal, a Taiwan official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The revised version of the Russian environmental protection law
will allow its nuclear facilities to permanently store nuclear waste
from foreign countries, said the official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.</P>
      <P>Under the brokerage of a private Russian firm, the Taiwan Power
Company (Taipower) has contracted the Russian National Science
Institute to dispose of 5,000 barrels of low-level radioactive waste.</P>
      <P>If the pilot contract had been carried out successfully, the
official said, more Taiwan nuclear waste would have gone to Russia.</P>
      <P>However, the contract was blocked by existing Russian laws
forbidding the import of nuclear waste.</P>
      <P>If the Russian National Science Institute is given a thumbs up
for the disposal of radioactive waste from Taiwan, the some 30,000
barrels of nuclear waste now kept at the island's three nuclear
plants will take precedence over the 90,000 barrels dumped at the
island's only nuclear waste dump on Orchid Island.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has been seeking a permanent overseas dump site for its
130,000 barrels of nuclear waste due to strong advocacy of domestic
anti-nuclear groups to rid Taiwan of radioactive waste.</P>
      <P>The difficulty in finding a site to keep the waste generated by
the island's three nuclear plants was one of the reasons that
prompted the administration of President Chen Shui-bian to halt the
construction of the island's fourth nuclear plant.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ECONOMY `TURNING THE CORNER:' GOVERNMENT ECONOMIST</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 27 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A government economist said Wednesday that
the local economy will "soon turn the corner" and improve.</P>
      <P>Lee Kao-chao, vice chairman of the Council for Economic Planning
and Development, said that what he described as "the 10th cycle"
could be the shortest one in the island's economic history.</P>
      <P>Saying that the stock market, which plummeted that day to a
five-year low, is an indicator of what the economy will be like in
six months or a year, Lee noted that the economy cannot turn around
before the stock market recovers.</P>
      <P>However, he went on, there is a sliver lining, citing falling
international oil prices, no threat of inflation, a possible rate cut
by the U.S. Federal Reserve Board and prospects for a soft landing
for the U.S. economy.</P>
      <P>Although there is little hope for a booming economy in the United
States, which is the island's major export market, Japan, where the
economy is expected to maintain a 2001 growth rate similar to this
year, could absorb some of Taiwan's exports intended for the United
States, he said.</P>
      <P>Given that the information and electronic industries have become
the backbone of the island's economy, the short life cycle of their
products means an acceleration of the economic cycle, which means a
reversal of the economic downturn might not be far away, said Lee.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT LAWMAKERS TO VISIT BEIJING NEXT MONTH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 28 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of legislators from Taiwan's major
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) is scheduled to visit mainland China Jan.
4-11 to exchange views with mainland leaders on the issue of "three
direct links" across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The group will be comprised of some 40 KMT lawmakers and
specialists from several of the party's think-tanks, including Kao
Kung-lian, former vice chairman of the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs
Council, said Ho Chih-hui, party whip of the KMT caucus in the
Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>The KMT legislators and specialists, at the invitation of
mainland China's intermediary body with Taiwan, the Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS), are expected to visit
Beijing first to meet mainland Chinese leaders on matters pertaining
to direct trade, mail, and shipping links between Taiwan and mainland
China, better known as the "big three links" initiative, according to
Ho.</P>
      <P>The group members are also expected to meet with officials from
mainland China's ministries of transportation, foreign trade, postal
affairs and civil aviation, for talks on technical issues related to
the "big three links."</P>
      <P>Following their Beijing visit, the KMT legislators and
specialists will visit mainland China's leading port cities of
Shanghai, Tianjin, Qingdao, and Fuzhou on fact-finding tours, Ho
said.</P>
      <P>According to Ho, KMT Chairman Lien Chan said he fully supports
the forthcoming visit to mainland China by KMT lawmakers and experts,
noting that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait should resume
negotiations as early as possible. He added that as the major
opposition party, the KMT should do what it can in this respect as
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party has been unable to.</P>
      <P>Beijing has invited the KMT group to the mainland for talks on
the "big three links" while evidently giving the cold shoulder to the
DPP-initiated "mini three links," referring to direct trade, mail,
and shipping links between the Republic of China's frontline islands
of Kinmen and Matsu and mainland China's Fujian port cities of Xiamen
and Fuzhou.</P>

for this Thursday, has been delayed until early next year because
preparations are behind schedule.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The establishment of the Taiwan
Confederation of Trade Unions (TCTU) on May 1 was voted the top job
market news story in the country for the year 2000 by Taiwan's 9-to-5
working men and women in an on-line survey.</P>
      <P>Topping the list of 10 most reported and influential job market
news stories over the past year, the establishment of the TCTU marked
a milestone in the progress of general employees' decision-making
rights, said the Taipei Office Workers Association, which conducted
the survey in collaboration with the China Times Website.</P>
      <P>Second on the top 10 list was the story of a part-time
student-worker at the Tienmu branch of the Carrefour discount store
franchise who was forced by the store management to eat burned cakes.</P>

      <P>Fourth was the Pahchang Creek Incident, in which four unlucky
river-bed cleaners trapped together in rising Pahchang Creek flood
waters in the southern county of Chiayi waited for over two hours for
a rescue that never came before finally losing their footing and
being swept away to their deaths.</P>
      <P>The controversial shortened workweek plan ranked as the fifth top
story, while labor union activist Tseng Mao-hsiung's arrest came in
sixth.</P>
      <P>Chosen as the seventh most important job market news story was
the Department of Health's decision to assist enterprises in
establishing nursing rooms at work to help working women take care of
their infants or young children.</P>
      <P>Ranking eighth on the list was the prevalence of layoffs of
employees by Internet-related companies as a result of low business.</P>
      <P>The story of members of several labor unions in a number of
private-run companies being suppressed or fired in the wake of labor
union activities ranked ninth on the list.</P>
      <P>And rounding out the top ten was the continuing increase in

    <HEADLINE>MAC PITCHES FOR CLOSER CROSS-STRAIT JUDICIAL ASSISTANCE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  28 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The two sides of the Taiwan Strait should
strengthen mutual judicial assistance after the opening of direct
"mini three links," a senior mainland affairs official said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Lin Chong-pin, vice chairman of the Cabinet-level Mainland
Affairs Council (MAC), which charts Taiwan's policy toward mainland
China, made the appeal as part of his efforts to allay public
misgivings about a possible rise in the crime rate following the
onset of the "mini three links."</P>
      <P>In line with the Offshore Islands Development Act passed by the
legislature earlier this year, the Republic of China government is
scheduled Jan. 1 to formally open direct trade, mail and shipping
links between its defense outposts of Kinmen and Matsu, and mainland
China's Xiamen and Fuzhou ports, commonly known as the "mini three
links," on a trial basis for one year.</P>
      <P>Some people are worried that the opening of direct exchanges of
people and goods between the two frontline islands and the mainland
may cause sabotages to legal order on both sides and a rise in the
crime rate.</P>
      <P>Responding to such worries, Lin said judicial organizations on
the two sides of the Taiwan Strait should reinforce mutual
assistance and join forces to crack down on crime so as to ensure
smooth opening of the "mini three links."</P>
      <P>Noting that the success of the "mini three links" hinges on
security management and safeguarding of law and order, Lin said the
ROC government looks forward to forging systematic consultative
channels with the mainland to facilitate orderly cross-strait
exchanges and better protect the legitimate rights and interests of
the people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Lin said the ROC's Ministry of National Defense, the Ministry of
the Interior, the Ministry of Justice, the National Coast Guard
Administration and other relevant government agencies have completed
various security measures to curb possible illegal entry and exit as
well as smuggling and illegal transshipment of goods between
the Taiwan proper and the mainland following the opening of the
"mini three links."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lin said he feels regret over Legislator Chen
Ching-pao's decision to suspend a planned trial voyage between
Kinmen and Xiamen before the formal opening of the "mini three
links" with a view to testing the safety of the new route. Chen
was forced to cancel the plan mainly because of Beijing's pressure.</P>
      <P>Lin called on mainland China to adopt a pragmatic, positive
manner to deal with such kind of cross-strait engagement to help
foster mutual trust and rapprochement.</P>
      <P>He further stressed that the government has no intention of
promoting full-fledged direct cross-strait trade, mail and transport
links, also known as the "big three links," by opening the "mini
three links."</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Lin said he is convinced that the experience from
implementing the "mini three links" will be helpful to planning
an orderly opening of the "big three links."</P>
      <P>In related news, MAC Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen said the ROC
government will do its utmost to protect personal safety of Taiwan
visitors to the mainland.</P>
      <P>"We also hope that mainland authorities will offer all necessary
assistance and protection for ROC nationals during their stay on the
mainland," Tsai said, adding that the ROC government will also
provide all needed assistance and protection for mainland visitors
to Kinmen and Matsu following the opening of the "mini three links."</P>
      <P>Tsai further said as mainland China still declines to resume
dialogue with Taiwan, local shipping companies intending to operate
scheduled or chartered shipping services to mainland ports
after the opening of the "mini three links" should obtain prior
mainland approval to avoid unnecessary risks and losses.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRODUCTION VALUE OF INFO HARDWARE SEEN GROWING BY 20.5% THIS YEAR</HEADLINE>

      <P>The production value of information
hardware is expected to grow by 20.5 percent this year, the Institute
for Information Industry (III) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>III officials noted that the world economy started to rebound
last year and continued to turn for the better over the first half of
2000. For the second half of this year, with slumping world stock
markets and a weak Euro, global economic performance was not as good
as estimated.</P>
      <P>But the officials noted that Taiwan's major information products'
global market share has remained high, adding that notebook computers
produced in Taiwan have the largest market share in the world.</P>
      <P>With respect to computer monitors, with the price of LCD panels
slipping, the price of LCD monitors has also dropped, they said,
noting that Taiwan's world market share still continues to grow
steadily in this area.</P>
      <P>In addition, Taiwan's telecommunications industry has
demonstrated good performance because of the steady production of
cellular phones. It is expected that the growth in cellular phone
production will help stimulate growth in the overall
telecommunications industry over the next few years, the officials
said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Defense Minister Wu Shih-wen made an
inspection tour of the frontline island of Matsu Thursday to review
security measures adopted by the Matsu defense command ahead of the
imminent opening of the "mini three links."</P>
      <P>Wu said after his return from Matsu that he was satisfied with
the circumspect preparations done by the Matsu defense command to
ensure the offshore island's security following the opening of the
"mini three links."</P>
      <P>In line with the Offshore Islands Development Act passed by the
Legislative Yuan earlier this year, the Republic of China government
is scheduled Jan. 1 to formally open direct trade, mail and shipping
links between its defense outposts of Kinmen and Matsu, and mainland
China's Xiamen and Fuzhou ports, commonly known as the "mini three
links," on a trial basis for one year.</P>
      <P>Wu said he is convinced that the limited opening of direct
exchanges of people and goods with the mainland will not have any
adverse impact on Matsu's security and defense operations since the
ROC military has reinforced its security measures and adjusted some
defense deployment and tactics.</P>
      <P>As for the possibility of military reconciliation between the
two sides of the Taiwan Strait, Wu said the time is still not yet
ripe to consider such an issue. "It will depend on whether the 'mini

    <DATELINE>Paris,  Dec.  27 (CNA)
(By M.J. Tzou and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Chinese-French novelist and playwright Gao
Xingjian, who won this year's Nobel Prize in literature, is scheduled
to arrive in Taiwan Feb. 1 for a two-week visit, Republic of China
Representative to France Kuo Wei-fan said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Kuo made the announcement at a dinner he hosted in honor of Gao
and Chu Teh-chun, a celebrated artist who was just elected an
academician of the prestigious Institute de France.</P>
      <P>According to Kuo, Gao will receive an honorary doctorate in
literature from the ROC's National Sun Yat-sen University during his
stay, in recognition of his outstanding achievements in creative
writing.</P>
      <P>For his part, Gao said he appreciates all the care and assistance
Kuo has given him over the years. Gao, a survivor of mainland China's
Cultural Revolution who fled the mainland for France after his works
were banned, recalled that Kuo helped organize his first trip to
Taiwan in 1993 when Kuo was chairman of the ROC's Council of Cultural
Affairs.</P>
      <P>Gao said he has since made many other trips to Taiwan and has
made friends with many of its literary, theatrical, artistic and
religious elite. "I have found warmth and comfort in Taiwan and have
come to feel that the island is my homeland," he added.</P>
      <P>As the first Chinese writer to win the Nobel Prize, Gao said the
honor should be shared by all Chinese people because he does not
think his personal achievements deserve the laurel. "The prize also
marks a recognition of Chinese culture," he noted.</P>
      <P>Despite Beijing's repressive and unpopular rule, Gao said, the
rich Chinese culture still enjoys a strong following in the world
judging from the enthusiastic global response to his winning of the
Nobel Prize.</P>
      <P>Gao's upcoming Taiwan visit is organized by the Bureau of
Cultural Affairs of Taipei City Hall. He will be a keynote speaker at
a number of seminars to be sponsored by two major Taiwan press groups
-- the China Times and the United Daily News.</P>
      <P>During his visit, Gao will also meet with ROC President Chen
Shui-bian and Tchen Yu-chiou, chairwoman of the council of Cultural
Affairs.</P>
      <P>The Swedish Academy cited the "bitter insights and linguistic
ingenuity" in Gao's works such as the play "Fugitives," set against
the background of the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre, and "Soul
Mountain," a narrative about Gao's travels in southwestern China.</P>

      <P>The trend of Taiwan personal computer

    <HEADLINE>NEW TAX BREAKS INTRODUCED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  28 (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's lawmakers gave the nation's wage
earners a holiday gift Thursday in the form of bigger tax breaks,
only days before the end of this century's last legislative session.</P>
      <P>After numerous negotiations among the ruling and opposition party
caucuses, the Legislative Yuan passed the amendments to articles 17
and 126 of the Income Tax Law, raising the ceiling for a special
tax-free income deductible from the current NT$62,000 (US$1,870) to
NT$75,000 (US$2,262) per year per taxpayer.</P>
      <P>This pre-tax deductible works out to approximately NT$780 (US$24)
to NT$5,200 (US$157) in tax breaks per person, depending on each
individual's income and taxation level, which can vary from 6 percent
to 40 percent of one's total income.</P>
      <P>When husband and wife are both wage earners, each receives his or
her own NT$75,000 pre-tax deductible whether they file their tax
returns together or not.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, each taxpayer can strike off an additional NT$120,000
(US$3,619) per year from his or her taxable income for apartment and
house rentals for residential purposes. This translates into anywhere
from NT$7,200 (US$217) to NT$48,000 (US$1,448) in final tax breaks,
again depending on one's income level.</P>
      <P>Another amendment passed Thursday allows taxpayers over the age
of 70 who file their own returns to receive 1.5 times the amount of
all tax-free deductibles they are eligible to claim. Prior to the
amendment, only those 70-years-or-older taxpayers who filed their
taxes as dependents on the return forms of their families or
relatives were eligible for the same break.</P>
      <P>Because the amendments include a clause that allows them to be
retroactively applied to all income earned this year, the new tax
deductible scheme can be used when filing tax returns in March 2001.</P>
      <P>According to the Ministry of Finance, the government treasury
stands to lose approximately NT$8.2 billion (US$247 million) in
taxation income due to the new changes. This additional loss comes on
the heels of a recent move to reduce and finally eliminate the gross
revenue tax for the financial sector, which will lead to an estimated
loss of over NT$30 billion (US$905 million) in revenues for the
national coffer.</P>
      <P>To cover the revenue losses, ministry sources indicated that the
government will attempt to raise NT$70 billion (US$2.1 billion) in
treasury bonds next year as a transitional measure.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GOVERNMENT BID TO EXTEND WORKWEEK FAILS IN LEGISLATIVE YUAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  28  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>With three days to go before the 84-hour
bi-weekly workweek takes effect, the government's attempts to extend
it to cushion the effects on local industries failed again in the
Legislative Yuan Thursday.</P>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) motioned in the
Legislative Yuan for the third time to change Thursday's agenda to
discuss the government's proposal to revise Article 30 of the Labor
Standards Law, which limits the maximum workweek to 84 hours in
every two-week period, but was defeated by a 64-84 margin, with five
abstentions.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian called Wang Jin-pyng, president of the
Legislative Yuan, to urge him to put national interest beyond
partisan haggling and rally behind the government's proposal, but
Chen's concerns only irritated the opposition, which denounced the
president for trying to interfere with legislative business.</P>
      <P>Chen called Wang again after the vote, to explore the possibility
of revisiting the issue the following day, which would be the
deadline for any possible revision.</P>
      <P>A 44-hour workweek was the government's original initiative, but
was cut down to the 84-hour bi-weekly version and approved by the
opposition-controlled Legislative Yuan on June 16.</P>
      <P>Then-Premier Tang Fei chose to take it lying down and did not ask
the legislature to reconsider.</P>
      <P>The shorter workweek version caused a backlash among the island's
industries, especially when the economy expansion began to slow down
in the latter half of this year. Bosses complained that the new
workweek will force more firms out of business and lead to higher
unemployment.</P>
      <P>However, labor groups, which were in favor of the shorter hours,
refused to budge and called on the opposition lawmakers to stick to
their original stance to protect workers' rights.</P>
      <P>In the last two weeks, the opposition alliance put forward a
compromise which would provide that the workweek could be extended to
88-hours in every two-week period, as long as it was agreed by both
employers and the majority of employees and registered with the
authorities.</P>
      <P>However, the total number of work hours could not exceed 48 per
week and the compromise would lapse after one year, or Dec. 31, 2001.</P>
      <P>The compromise, although similar to the government' plan in
principle, failed to win over the DPP, which insists on giving firms
18 months to accommodate the 84-hour version.</P>
      <P>The argument scuttled any efforts to bridge the gap between the
two groups and sealed the fate of the DPP's attempts to reopen the
issue Thursday.</P>
      <P>Predicting that the shorter workweek will wreak havoc on the
island's economy, DPP Secretary-General Wu Nei-jen said a day earlier
that the Kuomintang, People's First Party and the New Party -- the
three main opposition parties -- will bear the full blame for this.</P>
      <P>While the legislators were working on the issue Thursday,
separate lobby groups representing the management and workers
demonstrated in front of the Legislative Yuan, each group vying to
make more noise than other to make their respective voices heard.</P>

highly developed Internet industry, which facilitates the rapid
circulation of merchandise information.</P>
      <P>Although purchasing power in India is relatively low, the country
enjoys first-class merchandise information and has attracted many
international companies to invest there, Chang said, adding that some
Taiwan companies such as the computer giant Acer Inc., China Motor

      <P>He said his office has also focused its efforts on pushing
India's top 200 trade groups to purchase from Taiwan.</P>

software industry, which has attracted many Taiwan information
companies to search for cooperation opportunities there.</P>
      <P>According to statistics of CETRA's Bombay office, India boasts a
merchandise and service market worth US$150 billion and a potential
consumer population of 130 million.</P>

between Taiwan's two frontline outposts and designated ports in
mainland China -- the ministry invited related government agencies to
work out the specifics involved in preventing mainland goods from
being smuggled into Taiwan via Kinmen and Matsu.</P>
      <P>According to the measures, which were finalized by the Ministry
of the Interior, the Mainland Affairs Council, the Ministry of
Justice, the Council of Agriculture, the Coast Guard Administration,
the Directorate General of Posts, the Department of Customs
Administration and the Kinmen county government, the checkpoints will
be located at each island's main airport, seaport, and post office.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Coast Guard Administration will be responsible for
checking smaller seaports, the islands' coastlines and nearby waters
for any illegal activities, while the Directorate General of Posts
will be in charge of examining parcels for contraband.</P>
      <P>According to the Department of Customs Administration under the
Ministry of Finance, only a limited range of carry-on personal
articles will be allowed to enter Taiwan or the Penghu islands from
Kinmen or Matsu.</P>
      <P>Regarding the maximum dollar amount per transaction that may be
transferred from Kinmen and Matsu to mainland China and vice versa,
the Central Bank of China in Taiwan announced Thursday that a cap of
US$100,000 will be in effect other than for those instances when the
items being imported or exported are accompanied by certification
documents issued by the government-appointed currency exchange banks.</P>
      <P>In addition, the total amount of transactions cannot exceed US$5
million per person per year, or US$50 million per company per year.
Only residents of Kinmen and Matsu are allowed to carry out such
transactions.</P>
      <P>In line with the Offshore Islands Development Act passed by the
Legislative Yuan earlier this year, the Republic of China government
is scheduled Jan. 1 to formally open the "mini three links" on a
trial basis for one year.</P>
      <P>Although mainland China's response to the mini links is only
lukewarm, ROC Premier Chang Chun-hsiung said Thursday that his
administration will wait patiently for a friendlier response to the
"first step toward cross-Taiwan Strait peace."</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN LICENSES 1ST ABORTION PILL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  28  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) announced
Thursday it has approved the marketing of the abortion pill Mifegyne
in Taiwan as a grade-four controlled drug.</P>
      <P>DOH Director-General Lee Ming-liang said the drug must be
prescribed by gynecologists and only used under close medical
supervision at approved clinics or hospitals. The drug will be
covered under the National Health Insurance Program, he added.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, two brands of abortion pills, both of which
have Mifepristone -- commonly known as RU 486 -- as their active
ingredient, have undergone clinical tests in Taiwan, but only the
Mifegyne brand has been licensed by the DOH.</P>
      <P>Mifegyne is produced by the French pharmaceutical company
Roussel-Uclaf, which developed RU 486.</P>
      <P>RU 486 is a steroid hormone similar in structure to the natural
hormone progesterone, which is essential for establishing and
maintaining a pregnancy.</P>
      <P>Invented in 1980 by Dr. Etienne-Emile Baulieu, RU 486 is the
first of a new generation of birth control drugs called
"antiprogestins." As Baulieu later gave up his patent rights,
pharmaceutical manufacturers around the world can produce RU 486
based on his recipe.</P>
      <P>Lee said that as RU 486 has serious side effects, including
bleeding, menustrual-style pain and cramping and some nausea and
vomiting, the DOH must impose stringent controls on supplies and
distribution. Statistics show that about 1,000 local women who have
used various brands of RU 486 available on the "black market" have
developed side effects that were fatal in two cases.</P>
      <P>Before the DOH approved the use of Mifegyne, the drug underwent
clinical testing on 43 pregnant women at National Taiwan University
Hospital, Cathay General Hospital and Shin Kong Wu Ho Su Memorial
Hospital. The abortion success rate reached 95 percent, compared to
92 percent in the United States and 80 percent in many other
countries.</P>
      <P>Noting that RU 486 is basically made of anti-progesterone, Lee
explained that the drug in combination with a prostaglandin can curb
the growth of the embryo and bring about abortion in very early
pregnancy.</P>
      <P>Lee stressed that the RU 486 regime works only during the first
nine weeks of pregnancy, or up to 63 days from the start of the
women's last menstrual period. "After this time, the women's own
protesterone level is apparently too great to be affected by the
drug," he added.</P>
      <P>Lee said a pregnant woman must swallows RU 486 in tablet form in
the presence of a doctor before leaving the climinc and must return
to the clinic after 36 to 49 hours to receive the prostaglandin
which will complete the abortion. "And she must return again several
days later for an examination to make sure the abortion is complete
and to determine if she has experienced any side effects," he
cautioned.</P>

    <HEADLINE>INDUSTRY EXPERT URGES TAIWAN INDUSTRIES TO FOCUS ON GLOBALIZATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  28  (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The head of an association that promotes
the interests of Taiwan businessmen with investments in mainland
China said Thursday that local businesses should focus on
globalization instead of simply on the mainland market.</P>
      <P>Chen Ming-chang, chairman of the association, said at a seminar
on the political and economic situations of Taiwan and the mainland
in 2001 that next year will be an important watershed for Taiwan
businesses.</P>
      <P>If the companies only focus their attention on securing their
places in the mainland market but fail to explore the international
market, then Taiwan's economic might will be drained by the mainland
within a few years, he cautioned.</P>
      <P>However, he added, if Taiwan firms can establish their head
offices, design, research and development centers in Taiwan, relocate
their manufacturing centers to the mainland and Eastern European
countries, and develop their own brand identities in the mainland and
other Asia-Pacific countries, then the future for these companies
will be "limitless."</P>
      <P>Chen went on to say that mainland China's strategy in luring
Taiwan businesses has gradually changed from accepting every
investment to the current method of providing incentives to attract
certain selective sectors such as the high tech industry.</P>
      <P>He added that the Taiwan businesses entering mainland China have
failed to cooperate with each other and have even brought their
competition into the new market, a situation he said might have
adverse effects on their development in the mainland.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>An academic teaching at a Taiwan university
will replace Fang Chin-yen as representative of the Taipei Economic
and Cultural Office in Canada as Fang is retiring.</P>
      <P>Chen Tung-Pi, who lived in Canada for 30 years, taught law at
Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario and practiced as a lawyer in
Toronto before taking his current teaching job in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Fang said Tuesday he is thankful for the support and assistance
he has received from the overseas Chinese community over the past
four and a half years in Canada. With their help, he said, he has
enjoyed smooth sailing in promoting economic and cultural exchanges
between Taiwan and Canada.</P>
      <P>One of his proud achievements during his term of office in Ottawa
was the settlement of the knotty "Maersk Dubai" shipping liner case,
in which the Taiwanese captain and officers were accused by the
Filipino crew of throwing three Romanian stowaways overboard into the
Atlantic in mid-1996.</P>
      <P>The controversy dragged several concerned countries into a
diplomatic row that was complicated by legal battles and political
fights over Taiwan's sovereignty. In March 1997, Fang convinced the
Canadian government to hand over the six accused to face justice in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Following the "Maersk Dubai" case, Taiwan's relations with Canada
have steadily grown into increased trade and investment as well as
student and tourist exchanges. Two-way trade now tops C$5 billion a
year and people-to-people relations are booming.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Bilateral issues "take two to solve" and
bilateral ties "take two to improve," Mainland Affairs Council (MAC)
Vice Chairman Lin Chong-pin said Thursday.</P>
      <P>He made the comment after a Beijing spokeswoman described the
forthcoming direct trade and shipping links between Taiwan's two
frontline islands of Kinmen and Matsu and mainland China -- the
so-called "mini three-links" -- as "internal affairs."</P>
      <P>Taiwan is set to open Kinmen and Matsu to direct shipping and
trade with mainland China from Jan. 1.</P>
      <P>Beijing, which has ignored Taiwan's proffered olive branches
until Taipei acknowledges that there is only one China of which
Taiwan is a part -- the so-called "one China" principle -- greeted
Taiwan's latest gesture coldly.</P>
      <P>Lin said the direct trade and shipping links between mainland
China and the Taiwan-controlled islands indicate Taipei's goodwill
toward Beijing and noted that they have been implemented solely by
Taiwan in the hope that they will spark a positive and constructive
response from Beijing and lead to more opening by both sides.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has no intention of making the "mini three-links" a
stepping stone to formal direct trade links between Taiwan and
mainland China, said Lin, but he admitted that the experience gained
from the "mini three-links" will help prepare Taiwan for direct links
between the mainland and Taiwan proper.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PM CHANG TOUTS `TRANSFORMATIVE CABINET'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  29  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Calling the emergence of the Democratic
Progressive Party as the ruling party the beginning of government by
all the people, and noting that the people want to see the triumph of
reform, Premier Chang Chun-hsiung said Friday that the Executive Yuan
will change itself from a "progressive Cabinet" to a "transformative
Cabinet."</P>
      <P>Chang, who touted a "progressive Cabinet" when he was first
appointed by President Chen Shui-bian as premier nearly three months
ago, said that "we are not afraid of failure. Success will be on our
side in the long run as long as the direction is right."</P>
      <P>In his first yearend press briefing held at the Government
Information Office, Chang stressed the importance of
"transformation," saying not only does the organization of the
Executive Yuan need to be transformed, but also the relationship
between the administration and the legislature.</P>
      <P>Calling the idea of a "legislative alliance" an important
concept, Chang said he hopes that the opposition Kuomintang, People
First Party, and New Party, and the other independent legislators
will cease boycotting the minority DPP which is the ruling party and
form an alliance with it for the sake of national peace and progress.</P>
      <P>Chang, meanwhile, ducked journalists' suggestions that the
government form a coalition Cabinet, saying only that it is up to
President Chen to decide such a move.</P>
      <P>Chang, who took the helm of the Cabinet after Premier Tang Fei
resigned on Oct. 3, explained to the media his efforts to head the
administration and develop the economy, the two principal focuses of
the present administration.</P>
      <P>He met the press at a trying time when Taiwan is being plagued by
a slumping stock market, political controversy over the scrapping of
the fourth nuclear power plant, rising unemployment, and a battle
over the issue of workweek hours. Adding to the general buzz at the
same time is the fact that direct trade links between the offshore
ROC islands of Kinmen and Matsu and selected ports in mainland China
are set to kick off at the start of the new year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CROSS-STRAIT RELATIONS SHOULD ALSO BE TRANSFORMED: PM CHANG</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 29 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung said cross Taiwan
Strait relations should also be transformed while the Republic of
China government is undergoing a process of transformation for a
better tomorrow.</P>
      <P>Quoting former Premier Hau Pei-tsun, Chang said in his first
yearend press briefing since taking office on May 20 that
cross-strait relations should be transformed in a process from
"reconciliation" to "peace" and to "closeness," adding that this will
also be the direction the administration follows in terms of the
development of cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>Chang said that although the implementation of the "mini three
links," referring to direct trade, mail, and shipping links between
the ROC's offshore islands of Kinmen and Matsu and mainland China's
Fujian port cities of Xiamen and Fuzhou, is only a small step, it is
an important one.</P>
      <P>The "mini three links" is a crucial point in the transformation
of cross-strait relations, he added.</P>
      <P>Noting that the "mini three links" are a prelude to Taiwan and
mainland China's accession to the World Trade Organization and the
"big three links," referring to direct trade, mail, and shipping
links between Taiwan proper and mainland China, Chang called for
Beijing authorities to respond with goodwill and resume the
cross-strait dialogue.</P>
      <P>He said that in the past, cross-strait relations were based on
the notions of "either you die or I do" and "fighting to the bitter
end." Nowadays, relations have been transformed into a situation of
"competition between two rivals," he said, adding that it is hoped
that these relations will improve to the status of "co-existence and
co-prosperity."</P>
      <P>Describing the current cross-strait stalemate as a political
deadlock, Chang said it takes two to unlock the knot and called for
Beijing authorities to return to the negotiating table to resume the
long-stalled cross-strait dialogue.</P>
      <P>Facing mainland China's cold-shoulder reaction to Taiwan's "mini
three links" initiative, Chang said Taiwan will continue in its
efforts with patience and determination, all for the purpose of
redressing the cross-strait stalemate.</P>
      <P>Chang stressed that only by meeting problems in a pragmatic
manner can an opening be found to end the cross-strait deadlock.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council of Agriculture (COA) is
offering assistance to help adult men from earthquake-affected areas
who are now jobless find employment aboard fishing boats.</P>
      <P>Officials from the COA's Fisheries Administration said that more
than one year after the major earthquake rattled central Taiwan on
Sept. 21, 1999, there are still many people from the worst hit areas
who remain unemployed because of difficulty finding work.</P>
      <P>To help this special group of people, the COA officials said the
Fisheries Administration has so far sponsored nearly 40 men,
including aboriginal people, to receive intensive training so as to
give them the skills to be able to work on fishing boats.</P>
      <P>In addition, they noted, the COA is offering a monthly subsidy of
NT$15,000 to each of the new recruits who commit to work on
ocean-going fishing boats.</P>
      <P>The officials said adult men aged over 16 with a basic education

    <TEXT>
      <P>The United States' top liaison officer in
charge of dealing with the Republic of China is expected to be in
Taiwan next month for a routine visit, sources from the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs (MOFA) reported Friday.</P>
      <P>Richard Bush, chairman and managing director of the American
Institute in Taiwan (AIT), is scheduled to pay a ten-day visit from
Jan. 6-16, said Liu Chih-kung, director of MOFA's Department of North
American Affairs.</P>
      <P>According to Liu, Bush will exchange views with ROC political and
legislative leaders on issues of mutual concern and familiarize
himself with the latest situation and affairs in Taiwan and in the
Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The AIT was founded by the U.S. authorities in 1979 to handle
relations with Taiwan in the absence of official ties.</P>
      <P>Bush last visited Taipei in March this year to gain a better

      <P>Tsai, the top ROC official in charge of the country's mainland
China policy, is scheduled to arrive in San Francisco Jan. 20, where
she will deliver a public speech and take part in overseas Chinese
community activities to celebrate the Lunar Chinese New Year.</P>
      <P>Liu declined to say whether Tsai will visit other U.S. cities or
meet other people during her visit.</P>
      <P>Reviewing the development of U.S.-Taiwan ties over the past year,
Liu noted that a total of 26 congress people from the United States
visited Taiwan in 2000, eight of whom were senators and 18 of whom

      <P>Liu added that a transport secretary, six governors, six deputy

    <HEADLINE>ROC PRESIDENT STRESSES IMPORTANCE OF HIGHER EDUCATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Keelung, Dec. 29 (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian
said Friday at an annual meeting of domestic university presidents
that higher education should embrace reforms that will help prepare
the nation for the coming of the "knowledge economy" era.</P>
      <P>Chen said that the success or failure of university education is
a key factor that determines a nation's competitiveness. With a rapid
increase in the number of domestic universities within the past
decade, university education has evolved from the old notion of
"education for the elite" to a more public-oriented system, he added.</P>
      <P>Facing a highly open and competitive education market,
universities should refrain from excessive expansion and malicious
competition, Chen said, warning that the resulting waste in precious
education resources, the drop in the quality of education, and the
imbalance in manpower supply and demand could lead to negative
impacts on society.</P>
      <P>Chen went on to urge domestic universities to upgrade their adult
education programs and promote courses that will allow working
professionals to conveniently sharpen their collective competitive
edge so as to be able to adapt to the needs of a rapidly changing
economic environment.</P>
      <P>Universities are also charged with the mission of promoting the
stable development of the economy and a democratic political
landscape, thereby guiding the society toward cultural progress, he
added.</P>
      <P>At the meeting, the heads of the state-funded universities issued
an emergency statement urging the nation's lawmakers to refrain from
cutting education items from the government budget for fiscal year
2001.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Education Minister Ovid Tzeng announced that Chen has
allowed the ministry to propose the addition of a special NT$10
billion (US$302 million) item to the fiscal budget for 2002 for the
purpose of raising the international competitiveness of the nation's
higher education system.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PM CHANG'S `TRANSFORMATIVE CABINET' TO REFORM FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 29 (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Premier Chang Chun-hsiung
said Friday that the Executive Yuan is recasting itself as a
"transformative Cabinet" at the same time that industries and
financial institutions are undergoing a process of transformation.</P>
      <P>Chang, who defined his team of Cabinet ministers as a
"progressive Cabinet" when he was first appointed premier in October,
admitted at an end-of-the-year press conference that the so-called
progressive Cabinet's efficiency has so far not been up to par.</P>
      <P>He went on to say that the Cabinet's lackluster performance is
partly due to the global economic situation and the fact that Taiwan
is currently facing a key moment at the crossroads of political and
economic transitions, when "old and new forces are undergoing a
violent tug-of-war."</P>
      <P>A gradual pile-up of long-standing problems and an insufficiently
quick transition may also be contributing factors to the nation's
current economic predicament, Chang said. However, he added that his
Cabinet, being the ruling administration, will hold itself ultimately
accountable for the largest share of the blame and will not evade any
of its responsibilities.</P>
      <P>In the political arena, Chang continued, Taiwan just earlier this
year underwent its first peaceful transfer of power from one party to
another, while the nation's industries and financial sector are also
facing radical changes under the lead of a global high tech
revolution.</P>
      <P>Chang said that if Taiwan can overcome the "old" and bravely face
the changes, then the future will be "full of hope," and Taiwan will
be able to survive and emerge from the transitions to take the lead.
However, he cautioned, if Taiwan is unable to change, then it will
face the fate of being left behind.</P>
      <P>Therefore, he added, his administration not only has to be a
"progressive Cabinet," but also has to change into a team that is
able to bring about successful transformations. The team must not be
afraid of failure or of making mistakes during the transformative
process because staying on the "right course" is the "only way to go"
in the long run, Chang said.</P>
      <P>Facing the nation's economic problems of a rising unemployment
rate and a downward-spiraling stock market, Chang said that his
transformative Cabinet will reform the financial system and usher in
a "knowledge economy."</P>
      <P>Chang said that his team is prepared to tackle the numerous
problems facing the nation's economy today, having even worked out
the possible responses in the event that a financial storm strikes
Taiwan next year as some foreign financial experts have predicted.</P>
      <P>To strengthen Taiwan's financial system, he added, the finance
ministry will present a concrete proposal within two months to create
a framework for the necessary consolidation of the nation's financial
institutions.</P>
      <P>The first merger will take place Jan. 1, Chang continued,
beginning with the provincial government-owned Taiwan Cooperative
Bank and the private ChinFon Commercial Bank. The second merger is on
its way as well, he added. Taiwan currently has 53 commercial banks
and some 360 credit cooperatives serving a population of 23 million.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the government will also promote mergers for the
nation's small- and medium-sized enterprises so that they will be
better able to withstand the pressures that come with globalization,
Chang said.</P>
      <P>A law on the establishment of financial holding companies and a
financial institution merger law are both in the works, he added.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 29 (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Premier Chang Chun-hsiung
said Friday that the relationship between the administration and the
legislature should be like an alliance and that a coalition
government "is also a way to express a spirit of alliance."</P>
      <P>However, Chang added that it is up to ROC President Chen
Shui-bian, who is a Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) stalwart like
Chang, to decide whether to attempt to form a coalition government
between the DPP and the opposition alliance made up of the Kuomintang
(KMT), People First Party and New Party.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a yearend press conference, Chang said that the
nation is facing an unprecedented political dilemma and added that he
is grateful for the ideas put forward by many political figures.</P>
      <P>Fundamentally, Chang continued, a coalition government would
require its members to share a lot of common ground and mutual trust,
otherwise, they would differ in their views on many important issues.</P>
      <P>Chang stressed that he is not concerned with how much longer he
can stay on as premier and that all he cares about is what his
Cabinet does for the DPP, for history, for the people and for the
nation while it is still in power at this "key turning point."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, he said that convening a national conference to
discuss whether the Constitution should be amended is probably a more
viable way to resolve the current constitutional impasse, where the
minority government is headed by the DPP while the opposition
alliance has the majority in the legislature.</P>
      <P>As to how the new constitutional system should be designed and
whether the current dual-headed government system should be
abolished, Chang said that the solution can be discussed at the
national conference.</P>
      <P>He urged the nation's bureaucrats to maintain administrative
neutrality in the meantime to help bring political stability to the
country.</P>
      <P>Regarding his administration's decision to scrap the fourth
nuclear power plant project, which began under the previous KMT
administration, Chang said that he will respect the interpretation of
the Council of Grand Justices on whether the Cabinet's move was
constitutional.</P>
      <P>He also urged the legislature to support his Cabinet's proposed
44-hour workweek, claiming that if the previously proposed 84-hour
biweekly provision goes into effect Jan. 1 as scheduled, 70 percent
of the nation's industries will be adversely affected. If the
industries have trouble sustaining their operations, labor will be
affected as well, he added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Four leaders of the Zhong Gong
meditation sect in eastern Jiangsu province were sentenced last
month to prison terms ranging from two to four years on charges of
"inciting the overthrow of state power."</P>
      <P>The Hong Kong-based Information Center for Human Rights and
Democracy said Friday that the four -- Wang Wanping, Qin Zhaoyang,
Zhai Xuehai, and Long Jialan-- were among the 600 Zhong Gong leaders
arrested in and after October 1999, when China began to crack down on
the meditation sect as an "evil cult" and close down its 3,000
training bases and affiliated businesses.</P>
      <P>The information center said that the four were accused by law
courts of spreading two letters condemning mainland Chinese President
Jiang Zemin for giving orders to crack down on Zhong Gong and other
spiritual sects. The letters were written under the pseudonyms of
two senior police officers, it added.</P>
      <P>Like Falun Gong, Zhong Gong has millions of followers in China.
The Chinese government is worried that the spiritual movement may
transform into a huge opposition party in China, the information

(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A prominent Taiwan scholar suggested Friday
the government establish a special offshore economic zone in order to
deal with global competition.</P>
      <P>Liu Tai-ying, president of the Taiwan Research Institute, made
the suggestion during a meeting with President Chen Shui-bian earlier
on Friday.</P>
      <P>Liu said that considering the fierce global competition and the
necessity for domestic economic development, Taiwan should prepare to
set up a special offshore economic zone where the introduction of man
power from mainland China and other countries as well as the flow of
capital and merchandise will have no limitations, adding that the
sooner it does the better.</P>
      <P>He suggested that the government transform the already existent
Changpin Industrial District in Changhua, southern Taiwan, into such
an offshore economic zone, a move that he said would also help
balance the development among the areas of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He continued that this special offshore economic zone could
accommodate centers for research and development, manufacturing,
offshore finance, telecommunications, retail shopping, and
entertainment.</P>
      <P>Liu said he thinks economic growth at home and abroad will slow
down next year, adding that improving the local investment
environment and the opening of the domestic market to promote foreign
investment will be the government's most important task.</P>
      <P>The scholar also suggested the government increase public
investment and domestic demand to stimulate the economy and thereby
reduce the escalating unemployment rate.</P>

research institutes that President Chen has met recently in order to

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung said Friday that
the government plans to spend NT$65.5 billion to create a total
of 290,000 job opportunities within a year.</P>
      <P>Chang said that under the project, the government will create
62,000 additional job opportunities, set up training facilities for
100,000 workers, provide a brokerage service to help fill 100,000 job
vacancies and provide employers with incentives to hire a further
23,000 job seekers.</P>
      <P>Chang made the remarks at a yearend Cabinet press conference held
at the Government Information Office.</P>
      <P>He said that the government is greatly concerned about the
escalating unemployment problem caused by the nation's industrial
structural transformation.</P>
      <P>The premier also admitted that the domestic economy has continued
to decline and that daily factory closures have boosted the
unemployment rate.</P>
      <P>Chang also stressed the importance of environmental and
ecological protection, saying that the government's economic
construction cannot address only the short-term interests at the
expense of long-term development. If Taiwan develops nuclear power
plants because it needs the electricity, he went on, it will create
potential danger and environmental damage.</P>
      <P>He said Taiwan should develop alternative energy sources to large
nuclear power plants and noted that industrialized developed
countries have always diversified and regionalized their power
supplies, which avoids the problems of power cuts caused, for
example, by the toppling of an electricity pylon.</P>
      <P>Chang said that the government plans to invest NT$455 billion in
the coming four years to carry out construction of the island's sixth
electricity transmission project.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the halting of construction of the controversial
fourth nuclear power plant, Chang said that the decision to halt
construction was correct and that he wanted to leave the issue to be
judged by history. His principal concern, he said, is "whether we can

      <P>The responsibility of the Legislative Yuan is to supervise the
administration, and such a relationship would be tantamount to
"selling out" the public's trust in the legislature, Liu said.</P>
      <P>He added that what the nation needs now is not a "constitutional
precedent," but rather a government that follows and respects the
Constitution.</P>
      <P>Chung Shao-ho, the head of the legislative caucus of the New
Party, said that Premier Chang needs not bother trying to figure out
how to form such an alliance because the opposition parties will
throw their weight behind him as long as his polices are in the
interests of the nation and people.</P>
      <P>Falling short of directly objecting to Chang's call, James Soong,
chairman of another opposition party, the People First Party, said
that the administration and legislature each have their respective
roles to play.</P>
      <P>Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng, who is also the
Kuomintang vice chairman and who has been tipped by the news media as
President Chen's top choice in heading a coalition Cabinet, said that
it's too early to talk about a coalition government now and that the
Kuomintang has not discussed such an idea.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Wu Nai-jen, secretary-general of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP), denied that his party has pondered the
possibility of forming a coalition Cabinet.</P>
      <P>Wu said that the nine-member policy-making panel, of which Wu
himself is a member, has never mentioned the idea in any of its
regular meetings. With President Chen as its head, members of the
group also include Premier Chang and DPP Chairman Frank Hsieh.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Lin Chuao-shui said that it will be very difficult
for the Kuomintang and the DPP to form a cooperative relationship
simply because they hold quite different views on many important
issues.</P>
      <P>Legislator Shen Fu-hsiung, who is also executive director of the
DPP's Policy Committee, said that the resignation of the present
Cabinet and ensuing legislative elections are necessary before a
coalition government can be formed.</P>
      <P>Another DPP legislator, Chou Po-lun, said there will be no need
for Cabinet members to resign en masse and for legislative elections
as long as the Kuomintang is willing to join hands with the DPP to
form the coalition government.</P>

(By Edward Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice Chairman of the Cabinet-level Mainland
Affairs Council (MAC) Chen Ming-tung on Friday called on Macau
authorities to systematize a Taiwan-Macau communications channel.</P>
      <P>Chen pointed out that although relations between Taiwan and Macau
are steadily developing, Macau authorities have still not designated
an official to act as a liaison with the Taiwan representative office
in Macau.</P>
      <P>He added that under the restrictions of the so-called
"six-pointed instruction" by mainland Chinese Vice Premier Qian
Qichen, the Macau authorities are not able to freely handle relations
with Taiwan representatives, so he said it is therefore important
that a communications channel be systemized.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks after presiding over a meeting on Macau
affairs.</P>
      <P>Chen, who has recently visited Macau, also said that the Chen
administration will deal with relations between Taiwan and Macau on
in the principles of "good faith compromise, positive cooperation,
and an everlasting peace" as proclaimed by President Chen in his May
20 inaugural speech.</P>
      <P>He said he hopes that both Beijing and Macau authorities will use
a broad and farsighted approach when dealing with Taiwan-Macau
relations and eventually set up a direct communication channel in the
near future.</P>

(By Bear Lee)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung on Friday pledged
that his Cabinet will try its best to create what he dubbed as
"sunshine", or clean politics for the nation.</P>
      <P>Chang, who assumed the premiership in October, said at a yearend
press conference that the government will spare no efforts in
continuing the ongoing drive to sweep away the so-called "black gold"
-- referring to corruption and the connection between politics and
organized crime.</P>
      <P>"What we want is not only democracy, but also clean politics," he
said.</P>
      <P>To this end, Chen said that the Cabinet approved an action plan
in June and inaugurated a special task force in July to vigorously
crack down on black gold.</P>
      <P>He added that the task force has so far investigated 2,200 cases
involving corruption and indicted 600 suspects.</P>
      <P>Turning to human rights protection, Chang said that the
U.S.-based human rights organization, the Freedom House, in its
latest report lists Taiwan as one of the Asian countries whose people
enjoy the most freedom, saying this is a fair and reasonable remark
and a confirmation of the government's efforts to better human rights
protection.</P>
      <P>Chang also assured the people that judicial reform will be
carried out, which he said will largely increase the people's
confidence in the nation's judicial system.</P>
      <P>Responding to criticism that the Chen administration has ruled
the nation based on ideology, Chang said that his Cabinet will
prevent ideology from influencing policymaking and that he will ask
public servants to remain neutral when performing their duties.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC PRESIDENT STRESSES ECONOMIC REVIVAL IS GOVERNMENT'S FOCUS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 30 (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian
said Saturday at a breakfast meeting with the nation's industry
leaders that the government's current focus is on economic revival
through both short- and long-term means.</P>
      <P>As the nation faces an exodus of local industries, a rising
unemployment rate, and a dismal stock market whose total
capitalization is down by over 45 percent since May, Chen told the 16
industry heavyweights attending the meeting that now is not a time
for political bickering between the ruling and opposition parties,
nor a time for "artificially provoked" management-labor
confrontations.</P>
      <P>"The country belongs to everyone, and the economy is even more
nonpartisan," he said, adding that he will place the elimination of
obstacles stemming from "non-economic factors" as his personal top
priority.</P>
      <P>He went on to urge the industry leaders to use their influence
and take on the role of serving as "bridges of communication" to
assist him in resolving the differences between his Democratic
Progressive Party minority government and the opposition alliance of
the Kuomintang, People First Party, and New Party.</P>
      <P>From the government's point of view, Chen continued, to
revitalize the economy for the sake of responding to the impact
brought about by globalization and by the trend toward a "knowledge
economy" requires a two-pronged course of action that includes
short-term market-stimulating measures and long-term
market-bolstering policies.</P>
      <P>He added that although long-term measures will be beneficial to
the economy as a whole, they might have certain adverse effects on
particular individual companies or industries. Moreover, it will take
time for the effects of the policies to become evident, he said.</P>
      <P>Whether a corporation itself has sufficient capability to adjust
and adapt is the key factor to resolving operational difficulties,
Chen said, encouraging the business leaders to embrace new concepts,
new attitudes, and new methods to enhance their companies'
adaptability based on existing fundamentals.</P>
      <P>Government officials attending the meeting included Vice Premier
Lai In-jaw, Finance Minister Yen Ching-chang, Economics Minister Lin
Hsin-yi, Council for Economic Planning and Development Chairman Chen

    <HEADLINE>`92 CONSENSUS' SHOULD BE BASIS FOR `DIRECT LINKS' TALKS: KMT LAWMAKER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  30 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Kuomintang's party whip on
Saturday called for authorities on both sides of the Taiwan Strait to
discuss direct trade, mail, and shipping links between Taiwan and
mainland China based on the "1992 consensus."</P>
      <P>Legislator Ho Chih-hui, who is scheduled to lead a KMT
legislative delegation to visit mainland China Jan. 4-11 to exchange
views with mainland leaders on the issue of "three direct links"
across the Taiwan Strait, said negotiators from the two sides should
use the "one China, disparate definition" consensus reached in 1992
to resume the long-stalled cross-strait dialogue on technical
affairs, with political issues being temporarily shelved.</P>
      <P>Ho said the KMT delegation's top goals on this trip are to sound
out how mainland China has prepared itself for the much-talked about
"three direct links" and also to offer the Beijing authorities some
substantive suggestions on that concern.</P>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen visited
the KMT party caucus in the Legislative Yuan Saturday to brief the
KMT lawmakers on the latest government policies concerning the "three
direct links" and to offer tips on related affairs.</P>
      <P>Ho, meanwhile, said he and his group will propose to Beijing
authorities that mainland China open more important ports to Taiwan
shipping and related services so as to meet Taiwan business people's
expectations and the long-term interests of both sides of the strait.</P>
      <P>The KMT group will be comprised of some 40 legislators and
specialists from several of the party's think-tanks, including Kao
Kung-lian, former vice chairman of the Cabinet-level MAC.</P>
      <P>The KMT legislators and specialists, at the invitation of
mainland China's intermediary body with Taiwan, the Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Strait, are expected to visit Beijing
first to meet mainland Chinese leaders on matters pertaining to the
"direct three links" initiative.</P>
      <P>Group members are also expected to meet with officials from
mainland China's ministries of transportation, foreign trade, postal
affairs, and civil aviation for talks on technical issues related to
the direct links.</P>
      <P>Following their Beijing visit, the KMT group will visit mainland
China's leading port cities of Shanghai, Tianjin, Qingdao, and Fuzhou
on fact-finding tours.</P>
      <P>According to Ho, KMT Chairman Lien Chan said he fully supports
the forthcoming visit to mainland China by KMT lawmakers and experts,
noting that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait should resume
negotiations as early as possible. He added that as the major
opposition party, the KMT should do what it can in this respect as
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party has been unable to.</P>
      <P>Beijing has invited the KMT group to the mainland for talks on
the "big three links" while evidently giving the cold shoulder to the
DPP-initiated "mini three links," referring to direct trade, mail,
and shipping links between the Republic of China's frontline islands
of Kinmen and Matsu and mainland China's Fujian port cities of Xiamen
and Fuzhou.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CANADIAN MUSEUMS POST SUSPECTED STOLEN ART WORKS ON WEB</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  Dec.  29  (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Two of Canada's most prominent art
galleries have posted more than 120 of their collections' works of
art that are suspected of having been stolen from their original
owners by Nazis during World War II on the Internet.</P>
      <P>The National Gallery in Ottawa and the Art Gallery of Ontario in
Toronto put images of the art online so that people from around the
world, especially European Jews and their descendants, can examine
and possibly claim the works.</P>
      <P>Pierre Theberge, director of the National Gallery, said that not
all the art on the list was necessarily stolen, adding that part of
the reason for displaying the works on the Internet is that the
museum needs more information on the ownership history of the pieces.</P>
      <P>There are gaps in each of the posted paintings and sculptures'
history between 1933 and 1945 when the Nazis were in power in
Germany.</P>
      <P>Works listed on the Internet by the two galleries include the
French painter Edgar Degas' "Woman at Her Bath," Edouard Vuillard's
painting "Madame Aron," Spanish painter Jusepe Leonardo's "St. John
the Baptist," and "Bouquet of Flowers" by Jan Breughel the Elder.</P>
      <P>The move by the galleries is part of a growing trend among
institutions around the world to re-examine their collections and
attempt to return stolen art to their original owners or their
descendants.</P>
      <P>Last year, the Montreal Museum of Fine Art returned the oil
painting "Marriage Feast at Cana" by Italian master Giorgio Vasari to
the government of Hungary. The painting was said to have been stolen
by Canadian soldiers.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KINMEN-XIAMEN ICE-BREAKING VISIT WILL BE SMOOTH: KINMEN COUNTY CHIEF</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kinmen,  Dec.  30  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Kinmen County Magistrate Chen Shui-tsai
said Saturday he will head a large delegation, composed of Kinmen
social elite, to make a direct voyage to mainland China's Xiamen
port Jan. 2.</P>
      <P>"It will be an ice-breaking visit after more than 50 years of
separation of the two sides of the Taiwan Strait," Chen told a group
of journalists from Taiwan to cover the Jan. 1 opening of the direct
"mini three links."</P>
      <P>Chen said the delegation was originally scheduled to make direct
sail to Xiamen Jan. 1, but changed its departure date to Jan. 2 at
the request of its mainland host.</P>
      <P>As Beijing still refuses to resume dialogue with Taiwan and
gives a lukewarm response to the Taiwan-initiated "mini three
links," Chen said, the Kinmen County Government is under heavy
pressure in preparing for the new opening measure.</P>
      <P>Chen said he has sent special envoys to consult with Xiamen
officials on the mini three links-related issues. "My observation is
that our planned Kinmen-Xiamen visit would proceed smoothly and no
further changes to the itinerary are expected," he said
optimistically.</P>
      <P>In line with the Offshore Islands Development Act passed by the
legislature earlier this year, the Republic of China government is
scheduled Jan. 1 to formally open direct trade, mail and shipping
links between its defense outposts of Kinmen and Matsu, and mainland
China's Xiamen and Fuzhou ports, commonly known as the "mini three
links," on a trial basis for one year.</P>
      <P>Noting that the opening of the "mini three links" offers a new
opportunity for Taipei and Beijing governments to deal with bilateral
relations, Chen said the Kinmen delegation will show its greatest
sincerity and goodwill toward the mainland during its historic
visit.</P>
      <P>"We looks forward to starting constructive interaction with the
mainland," Chen said, adding that if necessary, he will ask the
Xiamen officials to convey to Beijing authorities Taiwan's goodwill
and friendship toward the mainland.</P>
      <P>Chen said the upcoming Kinmen-Xiamen direct voyage is of great
significance. Both Kinmen and Xiamen were under the jurisdiction of
the Fujian government before the split of China into two parts in the
1940s civil war. Kinmen, which lies far closer to the mainland than
to Taiwan, is now the ROC's frontline with mainland China.</P>
      <P>In view of their geographical proximity and close blood ties,
Chen said he hopes Kinmen and Xiamen will develop an even closer
relationship following the opening of the "min three links."</P>
      <P>Chen further said he hopes that the "mini three links" will
help usher in a new chapter in cross-strait rapprochement in the new
year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING URGED TO SUPPORT `MINI THREE LINKS'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  30  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Two New Party heavyweights in an open
letter urged Beijing Saturday to support Taiwan's "mini three links"
initiative so as to help bolster trade and civil exchanges between
mainland China and Taiwan's frontline islands of Kinmen and Matsu.</P>
      <P>On the eve of the kickoff of the "mini three links" on Jan. 1,
2001, Tsai Yuan-chang and Wu Cheng-tian, both former New Party
deputies to the National Assembly, quoted ancient Chinese strategists
by writing that "united, we prosper; divided, we suffer."</P>
      <P>"Both sides of the Taiwan Strait should endeavor to allow Kinmen
and Matsu to become a bridge of peace connecting the two rivals of
mainland China and Taiwan," the letter said.</P>
      <P>The soon to be implemented "mini three links" refer to direct
trade, mail, and shipping links between the Republic of China's
frontline islands of Kinmen and Matsu and mainland China's Fujian
port cities of Xiamen and Fuzhou.</P>
      <P>Tsai and Wu called for the mainland Chinese authorities to allow
for at least 700 mainlanders to visit Kinmen each day and 100 to
visit Matsu so as to help revitalize economic development in the two
ROC-control offshore counties and bolster civilian exchanges as well.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, in another open letter to President Chen Shui-bian's
government, Tsai and Wu urged that the content of the "mini three
links" be extended to be applicable to other related groups of people
based on humanitarian principles.</P>
      <P>The groups of people they were referring to include Taiwan
relatives of Kinmen and Matsu residents, the some 6,000 Taiwanese
families currently living in mainland China's Fujian Province,
mainland Chinese brides who are married to Taiwan citizens, and
elderly military veterans who came to Taiwan with the ROC armed
forces after 1949 when the ROC government moved its seat from the
mainland to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>They said they will soon launch signature campaigns in Kinmen and
Matsu to promote the ideas mentioned above so as to let the voices of
the residents of Kinmen and Matsu be heard by authorities on both
sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Religious activist groups voiced strong
opposition Saturday against the government's plan to consider
establishing casinos on Kinmen and Matsu as one way of propping up
the economies of the frontline islands.</P>
      <P>In a press conference held at the Legislative Yuan,
representatives from the Buddhist Care Life Association, the
Presbyterian Church in Taipei, and the Bethlehem Mission Society in
Taitung rallied against the idea of government-sponsored gambling.</P>
      <P>The press conference was called with the assistance of Kuomintang
Legislator Chen Hung-chi after the religious groups learned that Lin
Chia-cheng, chairman of the Cabinet-level Research, Development, and
Evaluation Commission, suggested that the government consider and
assess the possibility of establishing casinos on Kinmen and Matsu to
help boost tourism and economic development in the offshore counties.</P>
      <P>Kinmen and Matsu have been designated as the first two areas of
Taiwan to begin direct trade, mail, and shipping exchanges with
mainland China's Fujian Province in the so-called "mini three links"
initiative.</P>
      <P>Describing Lin's suggestion as irresponsible, Master Chao Hui
from the Care Life Association said gambling can only bring about
destruction and cause people to be reduced to ruin.</P>
      <P>A responsible government should never be so financially
shortsighted as to adopt policies that have the affect of pushing
people into the abyss of suffering, she noted.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC DONATES PLANE TO KENYA FOR WILDLIFE PROTECTION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  30  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture
(COA) said Saturday it has donated an additional plane to Kenya to
help facilitate the East African country's wildlife conservation
drive.</P>
      <P>The anti-wildlife poaching airplane, dubbed Piper Super Cub, was
presented to Kenya in a ceremony held at Israel's Herzliya Airport in
suburban Tel Aviv Saturday, COA officials said.</P>
      <P>Dr. Bill Clark, head of the Israel's Wildlife Conservation
Bureau's Law Enforcement Division, presided over an inaugural
ceremony for the plane. Republic of China Representative to Israel
Yang Jung-tsao and a senior official from the Kenya Embassy in
Israel also attended the ceremony.</P>
      <P>According to COA officials, the single-engine,
seven-meter-long plane can fly up to eight hours on a full tank and
is suitable for low-altitude flights. "We believe that the plane will
be very helpful to thwart poaching of endangered animal species,"
said a COA official.</P>
      <P>The COA has donated anti-wildlife poaching planes to several
African countries, including Ghana, Chad and Kenya, in the past few
years to signify the ROC's determination to assist African countries
in protecting endangered wild beasts. "Our efforts have received
recognition from major international wildlife conservation
organizations," the official said.</P>
      <P>In order to further assist Kenya's 26 safari parks in their wild
animals protection work, the COA recently decided to donate an
additional anti-poaching plane to the East African country.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the donation ceremony, Dr. Clark lauded the ROC
for its generous donation for wildlife conservation purposes. He
also recognized the ROC's conservation efforts, saying that the ROC
is one of the few countries in the world that have strictly enforced
its conservation law.</P>
      <P>For his part, ROC Representative Yang Jung-tsao said the ROC is
more than willing to cooperate with other countries in protecting
wildlife and natural ecology based on its conviction: "We have only
one planet."</P>
      <P>Yang expressed regret over the ROC's exclusion from many
international organizations simply because of Beijing's opposition.
"It is unfair to both the ROC and those international organizations
that need the ROC's participation and contribution," he decried.</P>

    <HEADLINE>POLL SHOWS TAINAN COUNTY CHIEF WITH HIGHEST MARKS FOR PERFORMANCE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  30  (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The results of a new public opinion poll
announced Saturday gave Tainan County Magistrate Chen Tan-sun the
highest score for administrative performance among the 23 county and
city chiefs in the nation.</P>
      <P>At a time when the mayors of Taipei and Kaohsiung have recently
begun the third year of their four-year terms and the county
magistrates and city mayors elsewhere in the nation are approaching
the fourth and final year of their current terms, the public's rating
of these local government leaders has been receiving much attention,
particularly as the next set of legislative, county, and municipal
elections are only a year away.</P>
      <P>Chen, a member of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP),
received an average score of 74 out of 100 for his performance, while
Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou, a Kuomintang (KMT) stalwart, ranked second
among city and county leaders around the nation with a score of 69.</P>
      <P>Penghu County Magistrate Lai Feng-wei, a KMT member who
administers the Penghu islands located strategically midway between
Taiwan-proper and mainland China, received a score of 68 from the
survey respondents in his constituency.</P>
      <P>Pingtung county chief Su Jia-quan of the DPP received a score of
67, while Yunlin county chief Chang Jong-wei, an independent,
received 66, placing him fifth overall.</P>
      <P>Tainan City Mayor George T.H. Chang, a DPP member, received the
lowest score of 47 out of 100, followed by Nantou county chief Pang
Pai-hsien, an independent, with the second lowest score at 54, and
Kaohsiung City Mayor Frank C.T. Hsieh, who serves concurrently as the
DPP chairman, at 56 out of 100.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung county chief Yu Cheng-hsien of the DPP and Chiayi
county chief Lee Ya-ching both received a just-passing grade of 60
out of 100.</P>
      <P>Chen Wen-chun, director of National Sun Yat-sen University's
Institute of Political Science, said that the Tainan mayor and the
Nantou county chief received low marks mainly because they are both
in the middle of lawsuits that have had a negative effect on their
images.</P>
      <P>As for the Kaohsiung mayor, Chen continued, not only has Hsieh
been unable to effectively carry out his administrative policies, he
has also given his constituents the feeling that he is only a sort of
absentee mayor because he is also serving as a party chairman.</P>
      <P>Wu Tung-yeh, director of the European/American Department of the
Institute of International Relations at National Chengchi University,
said that the poll numbers will become increasingly complicated as
the next election approaches.</P>
      <P>He went on to say that although the DPP now controls the central
administration, it is still a minority government. With the
lackluster performance of several DPP county chiefs and mayors, he
predicted that the DPP will place its emphasis on the legislative
elections next December.</P>
      <P>However, Wu said that the poor performance ratings of the DPP
local government officials will also adversely affect the DPP's
chances in the legislative elections because when a nation's overall
economy is doing poorly, it is usually the ruling administration that
is at a disadvantage.</P>
      <P>The cooperation mechanism between the opposition alliance of the
KMT, People First Party, and New Party will also influence the
interaction among the county, mayoral, and legislative aspects of
next year's election, he added.</P>
      <P>The opinion poll was based on 16,549 effective samples collected
from adult men and women over the age of 20 from around the country
between Nov. 8 and Dec. 9. The margin of error is calculated at plus
or minus 2.8 percent for Taipei City, plus or minus 2.9 percent for
Kaohsiung City, plus or minus 2.3 percent for Taipei County, and plus
or minus 4.0 for the other counties and cities.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian urged the
military Saturday to further upgrade its information warfare
capability and develop an integrated combined services command and
control system.</P>
      <P>Chen made the call in a speech delivered at a senior military
officers promotion ceremony.</P>
      <P>Chen said the Republic of China armed forces have made
remarkable progress in mobility, combat operations and
command/communication capabilities over the past year as a result of
internal restructuring and commissioning of a new generation of
weaponry systems.</P>
      <P>Noting that the military is now moving closer to the ROC's
ultimate goal of establishing an elite deterrent force, Chen said
the military should continue beefing up its information warfare
capability and develop a comprehensive combined services command and
control system based on its current achievements.</P>
      <P>Chen also encouraged the military to devote even more efforts to
manpower training and cultivation, pool resources with the private
sector to upgrade defense technology and consolidate combat
capabilities of the three branches.</P>
      <P>"We must continue our efforts to build up a modernized elite
deterrent force in the face of mainland China's persistent military
threat," Chen added.</P>
      <P>During Saturday's ceremony, a total of 10 military officers were
promoted to the ranks of lieutenant general or vice admiral, and 39
others to the ranks of major general or rear admiral. The ceremony
was presided over by Defense Minister Wu Shih-wen.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PLANNING OFFICE FOR FIRST TAIWAN ASSET MANAGEMENT COMPANY ESTABLISHED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  30 (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Minister of Finance Yen
Ching-chang on Saturday announced the establishment of a preparatory
office for the nation's first asset management company (AMC).</P>
      <P>Yen made the announcement after calling together a group of
domestic banking industry leaders, including International Commercial
Bank of China Chairman Lee Yung-san, who serves concurrently as
chairman of the Bankers Association of the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>Also present for the meeting were First Commercial Bank Chairman
Chen Chien-lung, Hua Nan Commercial Bank Chairman Edward H.T. Chien,
Chang Hwa Bank Chairman Chang Po-hsin, and International Bills
Finance Corp. Chairman Lin Hua-teh.</P>
      <P>Since the recent passage of a financial institution merger law
creating a framework for a much-needed consolidation of the country's
53 banks, the Finance Ministry has been actively pushing for the
establishment of an AMC to further reform the financial system
through the buying and selling of problem loans.</P>
      <P>Lee said at a press conference held in the Finance Ministry that
a total of 33 domestic banks have already expressed interest in
investing in the AMC, adding that he hopes foreign companies and
non-financial organizations will participate in the venture as well.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, the AMC, temporarily named Taiwan Asset
Management Company, will aim for a capitalization of NT$15 billion
(US$455 million) and will raise additional funds from the capital
market in order to tackle the formidable amount of problematic loans
in the financial market, to assist poorly managed banks to operate
normally, and to allow the financial industry to continue developing
steadily.</P>
      <P>Lee went on to say that a total of 13 to 14 domestic banks have
expressed interest in forming a financial asset service company to
serve as an alternative channel for banks to dispose of
non-performing loans (NPLs) other than through court auctions. A
percentage of the stocks will be reserved for foreign investors, he
added.</P>
      <P>According to official government figures, Taiwan's NPLs are
currently at about 5.6 percent of the gross domestic product. Foreign
analysts have estimated that the NPL ratio may be as high as 15
percent.</P>
      <P>Lee urged the government to establish an asset management agency
similar to the U.S. Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC), which from
1989 to 1996 administered federal savings and loan institutions that
went insolvent between 1989 and 1992 by either bailing them out or
merging them.</P>
      <P>Yen responded by saying that his ministry will carefully consider
all its options.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, at another press conference, Taiwan Stock Exchange
(TAIEX) Chairman Lee Chung-ying announced that the 54.4 percent drop
in the value of the bourse over the course of the year can only be
described as "painful."</P>
      <P>The TAIEX weighted index closed at 4,739.09 Saturday, down from
10,393 at the beginning of the year.</P>
      <P>Lee attributed the tremendous losses -- amounting to NT$3.6
trillion (US$109 billion) in market capitalization -- to a variety of
factors, including the Asian financial crisis three years ago, last
year's devastating Sept. 21 earthquake that caused an imbalance in
the supply and demand of traditional industries, higher international
crude oil prices, and a lackluster year for high tech products around
the globe.</P>
      <P>He went on to say that although 80 companies entered the market
with initial public offerings (IPOs) last year, the total value of
the bourse still shrunk dramatically.</P>
      <P>Giving his predictions on how the stock market will fare in the
coming year, Lee said that the TAIEX is in for even more upheavals,
particularly because it will become even more liberalized after
Taiwan's entry into the World Trade Organization.</P>
      <P>However, with sound economic fundamentals, including continued
two-digit growth in import and export trading and an estimated 5
percent economic growth rate, he expressed confidence that foreign
investors will continue to invest in Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC MINISTER SPELLS OUT STRATEGY FOR FUTURE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  30  (CNA)
(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Economics Minister Lin
Hsin-yi said Saturday that expanding cross-Taiwan Strait economic and
trade relations will be among the priority tasks of the government's
economic policy next year.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a yearend press conference, Lin said that economic
and trade relations between Taiwan and mainland China in the future
will become a competitive and complementary situation.</P>
      <P>He said that the government's plan to relax its "go slow, be
patient" policy in dealing with mainland China will be announced next
week instead of at the end of this month as originally scheduled.</P>
      <P>Lin said that the basic principle for relaxing the policy is to
open more items for cross-strait exchange while keeping strategic
technology in Taiwan and enforcing the monitoring of the risk of
capital flows.</P>
      <P>At present, Taiwan enjoys a trade surplus with mainland China,
while the volume of the island's bilateral trade with the mainland
accounts for 18 percent of its total foreign trade.</P>
      <P>Vice Economics Minister Chen Ruey-long said on the same occasion
that after Taiwan and mainland China enter the World Trade
Organization (WTO) next year, Taiwan businessmen will be in a more
advantageous position to enter the mainland market.</P>
      <P>In order to encourage Taiwan businessmen to expand their sales in
mainland China, Board of Foreign Trade Director-General Wu Wen-ya
said that the board may consider implementing incentives.</P>
      <P>At the press conference, Lin also pointed out that the priority
tasks for his ministry next year will also include working out a set
of new-century industrial policies, pushing forward important
construction projects, improving the local investment environment,
and acting to cope with the possible impacts caused by Taiwan's entry
into the WTO.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian is expected to
offer new initiatives concerning the government policy on
mainland China-bound investments in his New Year message,
Vice Premier Lai Ing-jaw said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Lai made the remarks in response to an appeal by UNI-President
Enterprises Corp. Chairman Kao Ching-yuan that the government should
ease its "no haste, be patient" policy on mainland investments.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a breakfast meeting between government officials and
senior business executives, Kao said mainland China-bound
investment is an irresistible trend.</P>
      <P>Against this background, Kao said, the government should assist
local companies in securing business opportunities and resolving
problems arising from their mainland investment activities.</P>
      <P>"We hope the government can ease restrictions on mainland
investments and take effective measures to help local industries
stay competitive and expand their global market shares," Kao urged.</P>

an overall review of the "no haste, be patient" policy and that
President Chen will announce major adjustments to the policy in his

      <P>More than 40 veteran Chinese dissidents
living overseas in exile jointly made a statement Saturday, urging
the mainland Chinese government to release Jiang Qisheng and other
political prisoners, a human rights group in Hong Kong said.</P>
      <P>The Information Center for Human Rights and Democracy said
Saturday that Wang Dan, Wu'er Kaixi, Chai Ling, and more than 30

and release the political prisoners as soon as possible.</P>

was sentenced on Dec. 27 to four years in prison on "subversion"
charges. The statement said Jiang's sentence was too harsh.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN BRINGS IN NEW YEAR WITH SEVERAL IMPORTANT NEW MEASURES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  31  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan is bringing in the new year with
several new measures that will have a relatively large impact on the
citizens of the island.</P>
      <P>Notable among them are the five-day work week for government
employees, the 84-hour bi-weekly work week for the island's laborers,
and the launch of direct shipping, trade, and postal links between
Taiwan's two frontline islands and selected ports in mainland China,
all measures which take affect on the first day of the new year.</P>
      <P>Gearing up for the shorter work week for government employees,
the administration has instructed its agencies to reorganize their
staff to work in shifts in order to ensure that vital government
services are not disrupted.</P>
      <P>Members of the armed forces, coast guard, police forces, along
with transportation crews, firefighters, medical workers, customs
workers, garbage collectors, morgue workers, quarantine workers, and
social workers, are among those who have to provide service
year-round without interruption.</P>
      <P>Local governments that oversee motor vehicle inspection,
residency registration, and real estate registration were ordered to
extend their business hours to 8:00 p.m. between Monday and Friday
and to eliminate their usual lunch break.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the shortening of the work week for government
employees prompted a reduction in the maximum number of work hours
per week for the island's laborers.</P>
      <P>Although the 84-hour per two week work plan was finally settled
upon after the government's last-ditch effort to extend it by two
hours per week was scuttled in the Legislative Yuan on Dec. 29, most
firms remain uncertain about how to cope with the new shortened
workweek.</P>
      <P>Many firms which face fierce competition from abroad are seeking
agreement with their workers to extend the maximum number of work
hours per week in order to maintain their competitiveness.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the implementation of direct shipping, trade, and
postal links between Kinmen and Matzu and selected mainland Chinese
ports in Fujian, commonly referred to as the "mini three links,"
represents a possible advancement in the stalled relationship between
Taipei and Beijing.</P>
      <P>Taipei authorities have expressed the hope that the goodwill
gesture to legalize the already thriving illicit small trade will
prompt Beijing to respond in kind and resume cross-strait dialogue.</P>
      <P>Although Beijing has tried to play down the first legal direct
links between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait in five decades,
Taipei is set to open them with the full glare of publicity in order
to let it be known that it is doing its best to warm cross-strait
relations.</P>
      <P>Beijing has suspended all contacts with Taipei since 1999 when
then Republic of China President Lee Teng-hui characterized the
island's ties with Beijing as a special state-to-state relationship.</P>

    <HEADLINE>OVER 50% BELIEVE `MINI THREE LINKS' WILL HELP CROSS-STRAIT TIES: POLL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  31  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>On the eve of the implementation of the
"mini three links" across the Taiwan Strait, the result of a public
poll released Sunday showed that over 50 percent of the public
believes it will help the positive development of cross-strait
relations.</P>
      <P>The poll, a year-end assessment and overview of mainland policy
and cross-strait relations conducted by the Central Policy
Coordination Committee of the Kuomintang, also showed that 31 percent
of those interviewed feel the links will not be helpful in improving
cross-strait ties.</P>
      <P>The term "mini three links" refers to the direct trade, shipping,
and postal links between Taiwan's frontline islands of Kinmen and
Matzu and selected ports in mainland China's Fujian province set to
go into effect Jan. 1.</P>
      <P>On the current pace of the development of cross-strait relations,
46 percent of those surveyed said the pace has tended to be "slow,"
in contrast with 28 percent who said the pace is "fast."</P>
      <P>On the comparison of the overall development of cross-strait
relations between this year and last, 39 percent said this year was
worse, while 29 percent said it was the same as last year.</P>
      <P>On the question of who should take the most blame for the
currently stalled cross-strait relations, 56 percent said both Taiwan
and mainland China should take the blame, 22 percent said the
mainland should take the most blame, and 14 percent said Taiwan
should take the most blame.</P>
      <P>One noteworthy finding of the poll was that 45 percent of the
respondents said they favor maintaining the status quo and moving
toward unification in the future, 27 percent favor maintaining the
status quo while saying any decision on the future hinges on the
development of cross-strait relations, and nearly 13 percent favor
maintaining the status quo and moving toward independence in the
future.</P>
      <P>Some 58 percent also said that the government should return to
the "1992 consensus" on "one China, separate interpretations," while
14 percent said the government should not.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 34 percent of respondents said they are pessimistic
about the overall development of cross-strait relations next year,
while 28 percent said they are optimistic. Also, 49 percent said they
have no confidence in the government's ability to handle a
cross-strait crisis next year, while 41 percent said they have
confidence.</P>
      <P>Just over 55 percent of the respondents said they favor the
government's plan to open Taiwan to investments by mainland capital,
and 63 percent of those polled said they favor opening the island to
mainland tourists.</P>
      <P>Some 46 percent of the people said that it is necessary to ease
the "go slow, be patient" policy toward investment in the mainland,
while 25 percent said that it is "not necessary."</P>
      <P>The poll of Taiwan citizens was conducted by telephone between
Dec. 24-25, with 1,096 people islandwide being surveyed.</P>

(By David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Negotiations between the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait will be conducive to the smooth operation of the "mini
three links," Taiwan's top planner of policies toward mainland China
said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Tsai Ing-wen, chairwoman of the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs
Council (MAC), made the remarks on the eve of the debut of Taiwan's
so-called "mini three links" -- direct trade, transport, and postal
links between its frontline islands of Kinmen and Matsu and the
mainland Chinese ports of Fuzhou and Xiamen in Fujian province.</P>
      <P>Tsai arrived in Kinmen on Saturday to inspect the preparations
for the implementation of the "mini three links."</P>
      <P>In addition to the smooth operation of the "mini three links,"
cross-strait negotiations on the issue will also be conducive to
expanding the scope of discussions to include the subject of direct
cross-strait links between the mainland and Taiwan proper, Tsai said.</P>
      <P>Accompanied by MAC Vice Chairmen Chen Ming-tung and Teng
Chen-chung, Tsai met at breakfast with Lt. Gen. Hsueh Shih-min,
commander of the Kinmen Defense Command, for discussions on the
maintenance of security in the Kinmen area after the implementation
of the "mini three links."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Tsai welcomed Beijing's consenting to allow members of
Taiwan's press in Beijing to proceed to Xiamen to cover stories
concerning the implementation of the "mini three links."</P>
      <P>She added that she hopes Beijing will adopt a more open-minded
attitude to talk with Taipei on the issue of the "mini three links."</P>

    <HEADLINE>NUMBER OF PRO-REUNIFICATION PEOPLE INCREASING: KMT POLL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Dec.   31   (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The number of people who favor
reunification with mainland China immediately or in the future is
increasing, the results of a poll released by the opposition
Kuomintang Sunday showed.</P>
      <P>The year-end review of the government's policy toward Beijing and
the ties between the two sides of Taiwan Straits, authored by the
Kuomintang's Central Policy Coordination Committee, suggested that
the hope by many Taiwan citizens that mainland China's booming
economy will rub off on the island may be one of the reasons behind
the surge in the pro-reunion camp.</P>
      <P>Chen Yi-chuan, a professor at the Chinese Culture University,
said at a press conference called to release the survey that Taiwan's
closer exchanges with mainland China in recent years might also have
contributed to the shift in public opinion by providing Taiwan
citizens with a closer view of mainland China's development and
thereby helping them shed their stereotypical views of the Chinese
Communist regime.</P>
      <P>Chen also pointed out that the Kuomintang's survey also found
that the number of people in Taiwan who favor easing restrictions on
trade with and investment in mainland China outnumber by more than 20
percent those who are opposed to it.</P>
      <P>And an overwhelming number of respondents said the government's
policy toward Beijing should be reviewed, indicating their strong
disapproval of the current policy, said Chen.</P>
      <P>Cheng An-kuo, who was the island's former representative to Hong
Kong between 1995-1999, said at the press conference that most of the
people surveyed said they favor the Kuomintang's call for the
government to pick up again the 1992 consensus of "one China,
separate interpretations" reached between the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait.</P>
      <P>The Kuomintang's stance is nothing else than that of the
predecessor government and represents mainstream public opinion on
the island, Cheng said.</P>
      <P>It is an approach acceptable to Beijing and thereby the only way
to restart the stalled cross-strait dialogue, he added.</P>
      <P>Wang Tan-ping, executive secretary of the Central Policy
Coordination Committee, said that the survey revealed the existence
of a prevailing sense of disappointment among the public with the
development of ties with Beijing, the government's handling of
mainland Chinese affairs, and the performance of the Straits Exchange
Foundation, an organization charged with contacts with Beijing.</P>
      <P>Tang Kuo-hsian, an official with the committee, criticized the
government's policy toward mainland China, saying it "has gotten
nowhere" because the ruling Democratic Progressive Party is deeply
divided on its approach toward Beijing.</P>
      <P>Tang's criticism was made one day after several DPP legislators
pleaded with President Chen Shui-bian to commit himself to the 1992
consensus.</P>
      <P>President Chen has denied that there is any such consensus and
has branded reunion with mainland China as "one of the island's
options".</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Shen Fu-hsiung prodded Chen to convert the
National Unification Council (NUC), which was set up by the
predecessor government in 1990 to highlight the island's dedication
to national unification, into an advisory council on national
unification and also to assume its chairmanship.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Lee Wen-chung echoed Shen's calls by urging
President Chen to reshuffle the council to better mirror the island's
political spectrum.</P>
      <P>Citing Chen's predecessor as an example, Lee Wen-chung said
former President Lee Teng-hui has never been shy about his
"pro-independence stance" despite the fact that he was the chairman
of the NUC, pointing out that Chen could do the same.</P>
      <P>Another DPP legislator, Yu Cheng-tao, said that on the eve of the
new year, Chen should grab the opportunity by reconfirming in his new
year message the 1992 consensus in order to get talks with Beijing
back on track.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  31  (CNA)
(By  Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Kinmen Magistrate Chen Tsui-tsai said
Sunday he hopes his own small step will be a big leap toward opening
the gates to cross-strait peace.</P>
      <P>Chen was referring to his planned direct sailing to Xiamen at the
head of a large delegation Jan. 2, representing the first such direct
visit in more than five decades.</P>
      <P>Chen's trip will come on the heels of the implementation of the
"mini three links," referring to the direct trade, postal, and
shipping links between Taiwan's frontline islands of Kinmen and Matsu
and the mainland Chinese ports of Xiamen and Fuzhou set to go into
effect Jan. 1.</P>
      <P>He said the 192-member delegation was originally scheduled to
make a direct sailing to Xiamen Jan.1, but changed its departure date
to Jan. 2 at the request of the mainland host.</P>
      <P>On remarks by Tsai Ing-wen, chairwoman of Mainland Affairs
Council (MAC), that the central government will not rule out the
possibility of including the local governments of Kinmen and Matsu in
a cross-strait consultation team, he said that he would be most
willing to join such a team.</P>
      <P>Chen also said that the implementation of the "mini three links"
will bring short-term business opportunities, including the upgrading
of industry and a service sector boom.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a private shipping operator said Sunday that he will
carry around 50 local residents to begin direct sailings to Xiamen
Monday morning.</P>
      <P>He Chin-liang, the owner of a 20-ton ship, said that he is
familiar with the route, adding that the ship will depart for Xiamen
at 9:30 a.m. and is expected to arrive on shore by noon.</P>
      <P>It is understood that the ship has not applied to the Xiamen port
authority for permission to enter, but He said that as both sides
have not discussed the issue of direct shipping, there are no
standard procedures and he has to obtain the consent from the Xiamen
port authority through its counterpart in Xiamen.</P>
      <P>He continued that the passengers are tourists who will stay in
Xiaman for three days at a cost of NT$5,000 per person before
returning Jan. 3.</P>
      <P>He also said that he hopes to learn more about the practical
problems related to direct shipping after the inaugural sailing and
then provide the information as reference for both sides of the
Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Both Xiamen and Kinmen were under the jurisdiction of Fujian
government before the split of China into two parts in the 1940s
civil war. Kinmen, which lies far closer to the mainland than to
Taiwan, is now the ROC's frontline of defense against mainland China.</P>

Shui-bian's victory in the March 18 presidential election reflected
the fact that the people of Taiwan have spurned organized crime's
connection to politics.</P>
      <P>The new ROC government has listed the crackdown on organized
crime and bribery as well as corruption in politics as its major
goals.</P>
      <P>Chen, accompanied by his two sons, arrived in London early
Saturday morning for the start of a private visit to Europe. Although
Chen is making a low-key trip, he was invited by overseas Chinese in
London to give a speech on the ROC government's crackdown on
corruption in politics. He also answered many questions raised by the
audience after his speech.</P>
      <P>Chen originally planned to stay in the Untied Kingdom for three
days before proceeding to France. However, he canceled the trip to
France because his application for a visa was rejected by the French
government.</P>
      <P>Chen and his sons will now stay in the United Kingdom until Jan.
5. While there, they plan to visit the Greenwich Observatory to
welcome the coming of the 21st century.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DOH ON GUARD AGAINST COMMUNICABLE DISEASE WITH START OF MINI 3 LINKS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  31 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) is on high
alert against contagious diseases from the mainland in view of the
opening Monday of the "mini three links" across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The DOH's Bureau of Communicable Disease Control noted that
Taiwan citizens traveling to Hong Kong or mainland China over the
past three years have mainly contracted dysentery, typhoid fever, or
cholera. The main communicable diseases present on the mainland now
also include hepatitis A and amebic dysentery, with dengue fever,
malaria, and the plague being present in coastal areas.</P>
      <P>To prevent any possible inroads into Taiwan by any of these
communicable diseases, the inspections operations in Liaolo Harbor on
Kinmen and Fuao Harbor on Matsu will be in line with those of
international harbors, DOH officials said.</P>
      <P>They said that international harbors usually check for the
presence of the plague, cholera, and yellow fever, adding that as
there have been no cases of yellow fever reported on either side of
the Taiwan Strait, the focus of attention will be on the plague and
cholera.</P>
      <P>The officials said that both Liaolo and Fuao harbors have set up
mouse traps and that edible sea products must also have certificates
to prove that they have passed cholera tests.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, in view of the fact that Kinmen and Matsu are closer
in proximity to the mainland than to Taiwan, residents of these two
frontline islands will be able to travel to the mainland in serious
or emergency cases, while helicopter services for transporting
patients back to Taiwan proper will be cut but not canceled abruptly,
DOH officials said.</P>
      <P>Kinmen or Matsu residents receiving treatment on the mainland
will be able to use their receipts to be reimbursed by the Bureau of
National Health Insurance, they said.</P>
      <P>More people might travel to the mainland to see Chinese medicine
doctors and to take Chinese medicines in the wake of the "mini three
links," noted the DOH officials, adding that these medical costs will
not be covered by Taiwan's health insurance plan.</P>
      <P>An official of the DOH's Committee of Chinese Medicine &amp; Pharmacy
also said that Taiwan citizens will be allowed to take back up to 12
different kinds of Chinese medicine, and up to one kilogram of each
type, from the mainland for their personal use.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT CHEN CALLS FOR CROSS-STRAIT INTEGRATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  31 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang &amp; Bear Lee)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian Sunday called on
Beijing leaders to try to break through the existing cross-strait
stalemate with open-mindedness and forward-looking vision so as to
jointly establish a mechanism for permanent peace and political
integration of Taiwan and the mainland.</P>
      <P>Chen made the call in his New Year's message which was broadcast
to the nation in the afternoon.</P>
      <P>President said that both Taiwan and the mainland are originally
members of a single family, adding that they should try to help
rather than hurt or even destroy each other.</P>
      <P>"We would like to call on the mainland government and leaders to
move past the existing cross-strait disputes and stalemate by
respecting the Republic of China's intentional living space and
dignity and by renouncing the use of military force against Taiwan,"
Chen said.</P>
      <P>"We should, beginning by seeking cross-strait trade, economic and
cultural integration, build cross-strait mutual-trust on a gradual
basis so as to seek permanent peace and build a new mechanism for
political integration between the two sides," the president added.</P>
      <P>Chen hailed the conclusions reached by the cross-party task force
on policy toward mainland China and pledged to set up a new mechanism
to take into account the views of various political groups in working
out policies toward Beijing.</P>
      <P>Turning to the economic situation, Chen said that although Taiwan
successfully weathered the energy crisis of the 1980's and the East
Asian financial storm of 1997, it now faces an even graver challenge
as a result of the economic downward movement in the United States
and Japan, the two largest markets for Taiwan's products.</P>
      <P>Urging both the public and private sectors to be well-prepared
for the challenge, Chen said that the government will work out a
sound plan for Taiwan's economic development for the new century.</P>
      <P>Chen also called on various political parties to stop wasting
their energy on partisan bickering and join forces to brace for
competition from abroad.</P>
      <P>Political instability will inevitably disrupt the island's
economic development, which is the lifeline of Taiwan, said the
president.</P>
      <P>Calling reconciliation the order of the new century, Chen
promised to keep his mind open and conduct wide-ranging consultations
in an effort to reconcile with domestic political parties and the
other side of the Taiwan Straits.</P>
      <P>On the eve of the 21st century, Chen also briefly recounted the
hardships the island has suffered and the marvelous development it
has experienced over the last five decades, attributing the latter to
what he called the "Taiwan Spirit".</P>
