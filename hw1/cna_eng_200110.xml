the eighth month of the Year of the Snake according to the lunar
calendar. Following is a list of important events that have occurred

    <HEADLINE>ONLY HALF OF MAINLAND-BASED TAIWAN BUSINESSES SAID MAKING MONEY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  1 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Only about half of the existing businesses
in mainland China that are invested in and operated by Taiwan
businesspeople are making any profits, sources from mainland-based
Taiwan business and trade circles said Monday.</P>
      <P>The number of mainland China-based Taiwan businesses which are
making money has gradually declined to an average of about 50 percent
of the total, mainly as the result of mainland China's unstable
investment climate which has become increasingly volatile in recent
years, a Taiwan businessman who preferred to remain anonymous said.</P>
      <P>The business leader singled out the prevalence of corruption and
overdue payments from buyers as two major factors that have affected
all the mainland China-based Taiwan businesses and have prevented
many from making any profits.</P>
      <P>Widespread graft and corruption have contributed to increasing
the operating costs of the Taiwan businesses in mainland China, he
said, adding that those businesses making large profits have
particularly been singled out as justification for the general
existence of the irregularities.</P>
      <P>Prominent money-makers have been easily targeted by the local
authorities and media, who have "picked holes" in them for no
justifiable reason, he said.</P>
      <P>He said that things usually turn out okay for the businesses
making large profits after they contribute "grease money" to relevant
mainland Chinese authorities. He added that otherwise, such companies
are subjected to perpetual attacks and fault-finding to the point
where they are so battered that they decide to close down operations.</P>
      <P>For example, he noted, the well-known Kentucky Fried Chicken
franchise, which is currently the most profitable company among the
restaurant businesses run and owned by Taiwan businesspeople in
mainland China, has received the largest number of threats and
extortion demands.</P>
      <P>According to another mainland-based Taiwan businessman, who also
spoke on condition of anonymity, overdue payments is the major factor
that severely depletes a company's funds.</P>
      <P>Citing a Taiwan company as an example, he said that after eight
years of operating on the mainland, which he said is an ordeal full
of twists and turns, the company now finds that it is not making any
money at all.</P>
      <P>The company's balance sheets have been in the black and its
average gross profits have been maintained at over 30 percent, but
the company has not been making any profits because it has had
difficulties collecting payments from its mainland Chinese buyers
after receiving the initial 30-percent down payments.</P>
      <P>The credit issue is an unbeatable nightmare for most of the
Taiwan businesspeople who maintain operations on the mainland, he
said.</P>
      <P>Taking an electronics company as an example, he said the Taiwan
owner of the company was so indignant with overdue payments that he
declared that he would give a Mercedes Benz as an award to anyone
among his staff who was able to collect the overdue funds from
buyers.</P>
      <P>He lamented that the heyday for Taiwan companies operating on the
mainland had already passed. He pointed out that Taiwan companies
have at most only three to five years left to flourish in mainland
China, adding that he himself plans to "pull back" to Taiwan after
five years when the "game is over."</P>

    <HEADLINE>LEGISLATOR URGES ESTABLISHMENT OF NATIONAL FINGERPRINT DATA BANK</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  1  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A legislator of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) on Monday urged that a national fingerprint
data bank be established.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Wang Li-ping made the appeal during a press
conference held at the Legislative Yuan. Central Police University
Professor Yeh Yu-lan and Criminal Investigation Bureau official Liu
Hui-fu also took part in the conference.</P>
      <P>Wang urged the Executive Yuan to keep one of the provisions of
the household registration regulations on the establishment of a
national fingerprint data bank, which the Executive Yuan is planning
to abolish.</P>
      <P>She suggested that newborns have their fingerprints taken when
they are vaccinated at the age of six months so as to provide a
record of identification when they receive their ID cards later.</P>
      <P>She noted that a national task force on promoting human rights
has questioned the establishment of such a data bank as it believes
that this will infringe upon human rights. She added that the
Executive Yuan has been forced to cancel the budget for a national
fingerprint data bank despite the necessity for such a bank.</P>
      <P>Professor Yeh said that the task force should realize that the
establishment of a fingerprint data bank will not infringe upon human
rights but will instead protect them.</P>
      <P>Yeh cited the murder of former Taoyuan magistrate Liu Pang-you as
an example, adding that the lack of basic data has made the case hard
to crack. Liu and seven others were murdered execution-style in Liu's
official residence in November 1996. The case has remained unsolved
because evidence at the crime scene was deemed incomplete.</P>
      <P>Detective Liu said that a fingerprint data bank has nothing to do
with personal privacy, adding that the establishment of such a bank
will help in the identification of bodies and of people who have
suffered memory loss.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOON CAKE SALES DROP 20% AMID ECONOMIC GLOOM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 1 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in the United
States and the trail of devastation brought about by Typhoon Nari
have spoiled local business people's hopes of a sales bonanza ahead of
the Mid-Autumn Festival, market sources said Monday.</P>
      <P>In the past, people began more than a week before the Mid-Autumn
Festival to form long lines in front of several well-known bakeries
around the island to buy moon cakes, a traditional Chinese snack
eaten on the festive occasion.</P>
      <P>This phenomenon didn't appear until two days ago, and the average
time each prospective buyer spent waiting in line was apparently
shorter than in past years, market sources said.</P>
      <P>According to market analysts, the anticipated economic gloom
following the terrorist attacks on New York City and Washington,
D.C., and the extensive Nari-triggered flooding in northern Taiwan
have made both business executives and individual consumers more
cost-conscious and frugal.</P>
      <P>Foodstuff makers had originally hoped that the arrival of the
Mid-Autumn Festival, which falls on Monday this year, could help
stimulate sales. Much to their disappointment, they saw
steeper-than-expected drops in their business turnover from
festival-related products.</P>
      <P>Based on sales of major ingredients for making moon cakes, such
as egg yolks, and relevant packaging materials, market sources said,
moon cake sales declined by an estimated 20 percent this year as
compared with previous years. Records for previous years show that
annual moon cake sales average a total of about NT$3 billion
(US$28.99 million).</P>
      <P>Although many moon cake makers have lowered their retail prices
in an effort to stimulate business, market sources said, the strategy
does not seem to have been of great help. Retail prices for specially
prepared high-quality moon cakes marketed by major tourist hotels
generally fell to below NT$1,000 (US$29) per case, but sales still
failed to match levels recorded in previous years.</P>
      <P>Some bakers complained that moon cake business this year was even
worse than that recorded in 1999 when the Mid-Autumn Festival
followed on the heels of the Sept. 21 7.3-magnitude earthquake, the
worst natural disaster to hit Taiwan in a century.</P>
      <P>Market analysts said the island's protracted economic slowdown
has also been a major factor affecting sales of moon cake and other
gift ware this year.</P>
      <P>A bakery clerk said the best-selling moon cake gift boxes this
year were those priced between NT$200 and NT$400 apiece. In the past,
the best-selling items were those priced between NT$500 and NT$800.</P>
      <P>The Mid-Autumn Festival, also known as the Moon Festival, falls
on the 15th day of the eighth month on the lunar calendar. It is one
of the most important festivals in Chinese society. Families gather
in the evening of the day of the festival to eat moon cakes and gaze
at the full moon. Government offices and schools are closed on the
day.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KINMEN WELCOMES FUJIAN'S PROHIBITION OF HARMFUL FISHING METHODS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kinmen,  Oct. 1 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Kinmen authorities expressed welcome Monday
for Fujian Province's decision to prohibit certain types of fishing
methods at sea, particularly the harmful practice of using dynamite
to catch fish.</P>
      <P>Yen Tah-jen, deputy magistrate of Kinmen County, said he is glad
that both Kinmen and Fujian, which are separated by a narrow
two-kilometer channel, now finally have a common perception that both
sides should jointly endeavor to protect fishery resources.</P>
      <P>He said the latest Fujian policy serves as a good start in terms
of cross-strait crime fighting cooperation, an area in which he
believes that both sides will have ample room to do more.</P>
      <P>According to Zheng Chuanmao, deputy secretary-general of the city
government of Xiamen, Fujian, who landed in Kinmen Monday for a
business trip, the Fujian provincial government has recently created
regulations which state that fishing by means of using dynamite,
poison or electrocution is illegal and that violators will be dealt
with severely.</P>
      <P>The regulations, publicized at the end of August, stipulate that
all individuals or groups shall be prohibited from using such
methods, that associations of people who use such fishing
methods and who manufacture and sell all equipment and articles for
the purpose of such fishing methods shall be disbanded, and that all
relevant fishermen shall register themselves and their equipment with
their local governments before the deadline of Sept. 15, according to
Zheng.</P>
      <P>Zheng relayed the latest policy to the Kinmen authorities Monday
when he arrived from Xiaman to pick up eight mainland Chinese
fishermen who had been rescued Sept. 24 in waters near Kinmen after
their vessel ran aground in stormy weather and rough seas.</P>
      <P>The owner of the "Zhe-Cang-Ji No. 20" freighter, identified as
Huang Dingsang, went missing in the tragedy and remains unaccounted
for.</P>
      <P>Illegal forays by mainland fishing boats into the waters around
Kinmen and Matsu, another Republic of China frontline island, have
become increasingly rampant in recent years.</P>
      <P>Residents from Kinmen and Matsu have complained that mainland
fishing boats have repeatedly sailed across the demarcation line in
defiance of ROC marine police forces' warnings and have used dynamite
to catch fish.</P>
      <P>Matsu fishermen attributed the mainland fishermen's defiance to
the "mildness" of the ROC coastal forces, who have been instructed to
practice restraint in order to avoid confrontations with the mainland
fishermen.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TWO TAIPEI MRT LINES RESUME SERVICE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  1  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Two Taipei mass rapid transit lines which
were partially paralyzed by floodwaters brought on by Typhoon Nari
two weeks ago resumed full service Monday afternoon.</P>
      <P>The Tamsui Line and the Hsintien Line resumed full service at 1
p.m., and it is expected that about half million commuters will
return to using these two lines when offices and schools reopen
Tuesday after the national Moon Festival holiday Monday.</P>
      <P>Trains on the two lines will be operated manually instead of by
the automated system that was used prior to the typhoon. It is
estimated that the trip from Tamshui Station to Hsintien Station will
take 63 minutes using manual operations, or about 10 minutes longer
than the time it takes using the automated system.</P>
      <P>The full resumption of service on the two lines will be good news
for Taipei, which experienced the brunt of the devastation brought by
Typhoon Nari. Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou has said that his most urgent
task is relieving the traffic jams that have been a common sight on
Taipei streets since the typhoon hit, stressing that "Taipei
residents will not be defeated by Nari."</P>
      <P>Although service on the two lines has been fully resumed, the
trains will not initially stop at Taipei Railway Station or
Shuanglien Station, which were badly damaged by the typhoon. Also,
the time interval between each train will be between 12-15 minutes,
much longer than the average of 2.5 minutes to five minutes when the
trains are run using the automated system.</P>
      <P>Typhoon Nari, which brought record amounts of rainfall to Taipei,
triggered unprecedented floodwaters in many places around the city,
including at Taipei Railway Station, through which four of Taipei's
five MRT lines pass underground.</P>
      <P>Only the Mucha line remained fully operational after Typhoon Nari
hit Taiwan Sept. 16-18. The other lines were badly crippled, with the
Pangnan Line still remaining closed.</P>
      <P>Taipei residents, who have become accustomed to the convenience
of the MRT system, have complained about the traffic jams seen across
the city over the past two weeks.</P>
      <P>Taipei Rapid Transit Corp. executives said that service on the
Pangnan Line will be partially resumed within two weeks.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN EXPORTS SAID DOOMED TO BE AFFECTED BY U.S. SLUGGISHNESS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  1 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's exports to the United States, the
island's major export market, will be impacted by the sluggishness of
the U.S. economy in the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on
America, Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) sources reported Monday.</P>
      <P>The bottoming-out of Taiwan's economic downturn, which was
previously expected to occur during the fourth quarter of this year,
is now doomed to be delayed as a result of the devastating terrorist
attacks in New York City and Washington, D.C., MOEA Statistics
Director-General Chang Yao-tsung said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's U.S.-bound exports, which usually experience their high
point during the fourth quarter because of the Christmas shopping
season, will encounter difficulties this year as the U.S.
unemployment rate continues to rise and consumers practice greater
restraint in the United States, Chang noted.</P>
      <P>He forecast that Taiwan's annual growth rate in the total value
of export orders for 2001 will be a negative figure.</P>
      <P>After the recent terrorist attacks, Chang noted, the United
States' aviation passenger carriage rate plummeted, leading to sudden
and prominent layoffs of employees by a number of American airlines,
adding that insurance, tourism and related businesses in America have
also been noticeable affected.</P>
      <P>A spate of typhoons that battered Taiwan in August and September
with torrential rains caused tremendous damage to the island's
agriculture and industrial manufacturing. Consequently, Taiwan's
manufacturing sector is expected after September to decline by an
even larger margin than it has in recent months, further driving down
the export business, Chang added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MJIB VOWS TO CRACK DOWN ON BANKNOTE FORGERY RINGS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 1 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau
(MJIB) will investigate whether there is any criminal ring involved
in banknote forgery, a senior official said Monday.</P>
      <P>MJIB Director Yeh Mao-sheng said he will order MJIB affiliate
offices around the island to intensify probes into the sources of
bogus New Taiwan dollar banknotes circulating in local markets.</P>
      <P>Yeh made the remarks after Central Bank of China (CBC) Governor
Perng Fai-nan took to the streets Sunday to demonstrate how to tell
fake money from the real thing.</P>
      <P>Quoting statistics compiled by major financial institutions, Yeh
said the average number of seized bogus banknotes totals about 1,000
per month, with the new versions of the NT$1,000 and NT$500 bills
being the most common.</P>
      <P>"Compared with previous records, the figure does not represent a
marked increase," Yeh said, adding that MJIB agents estimate that the
number of bogus banknotes yet to enter circulation might be far
larger than that of those seized.</P>
      <P>As circulation of fake notes would not only cause trouble for
local people but would also affect the stability of the local
financial market in the long run, Yeh said the MJIB will step up
intelligence gathering to determine who is behind the counterfeiting.</P>
      <P>New versions of the NT dollar banknotes were issued late last
year as part of the government's efforts to prevent forgery.</P>
      <P>MJIB agents said it's no easy task to counterfeit the new
versions of the NT dollar bills which have more than 10
anti-counterfeiting devices, marks or materials.</P>
      <P>Judging from the seized bogus banknotes, MJIB agents said,
individuals are most likely behind the majority of the phony bills.</P>
      <P>"Most of the confiscated fake bills were made by either printers
or copy machines and can be easily discerned by professional
investigators," said an MJIB agent.</P>
      <P>CBC Governor Perng visited a traditional food market Sunday to
publicized ways of identifying genuine banknotes. Perng's unusual
move followed a complaint by Taipei City Councilor Pang Chien-kuo who
said food vendors in the city's Huannan market alone are passed an
average of NT$1.35 million in fake notes a month.</P>
      <P>MJIB agents said, however, that the number of seized fake money
has not shown a significant increase. They said that the impression
that the use of bogus banknotes has become more rampant since the
circulation of new versions of NT dollar bills might result from the
fact that fake notes were mostly used in dimly-lit traditional food
markets and betel nut vending booths.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MANY AIR PASSENGERS SUBJECT TO WAR-RISK INSURANCE FEES FROM OCT. 1</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 1 (CNA)
(By David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Beginning Oct. 1, nearly all air passengers
in Taiwan will be subject to extra "war-risk insurance" fees which
will be assessed at check-in or will be added to the price of the
ticket.</P>
      <P>The increased fees come as a result of the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks on the United States and are expected to negatively impact
the already depressed local tourism industry.</P>
      <P>Starting on Oct. 1, domestic airlines will charge each passenger
an extra NT$60 (US$1.73) for each section of a domestic flight, and
an additional US$2.50 for each leg of an international flight.</P>
      <P>Northwest Airlines will charge each passenger an extra fee of 5
percent of the ticket price for each leg of a flight, the highest
among foreign airlines.</P>
      <P>In response to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, some foreign
airlines have raised their ticket prices between NT$90 and NT$2,000.</P>
      <P>In order to retain customers in times of uncertainty and a fall
in consumer confidence, some travel agents are trying to absorb the
increase in ticket prices and are still selling tickets at pre-war
risk insurance rates.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, domestic airlines are promoting their businesses
through various measures, including drawings for free airline mileage
points.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN SHOULD READJUST CROSS-STRAIT POLICY, SAYS AMCHAM CHIEF</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  1  (CNA)
(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan should readjust its policy toward
mainland China while engaging in domestic reform to restore the
confidence of foreign businessmen, said American Chamber of Commerce
in Taipei (AmCham) President Richard Henson Monday.</P>
      <P>Henson said that a recent AmCham survey showed that its members'
confidence in Taiwan has slipped to a five-year low.</P>
      <P>He expressed the hope that the ROC government acknowledge the
decline in confidence of foreign businessmen and address the
situation.</P>
      <P>Compared with the steady economic development in mainland China,
Henson said that Taiwan is losing its competitive advantage.</P>
      <P>What Taiwan should do now, he said, is to develop the island into
a global center for the service industry with completely free flows
of personnel, commodities and capital.</P>
      <P>The AmCham chief pointed out that Taiwan must recognize the fact
that mainland China has entered a better stage and is gradually
opening its markets and its regulations are becoming more
transparent.</P>
      <P>He said that many international enterprises have skipped Taiwan
to establish their branch offices in mainland China, a situation
posing a threat to the prospects of Taiwan's economic development.</P>
      <P>Henson said that Taiwan's policy of permitting only indirect
trade relations with mainland China has become outdated, and added
that Taiwan should employ a new strategy and direction for its
economic development.</P>
      <P>He suggested that Taiwan use its advantages in language, culture
and physical location to play the role of an "economic window" to
help enterprises set foot in mainland China.</P>
      <P>Henson said that implementation of the "three links" -- direct
trade, post and transportation links -- between Taiwan and mainland
China will no doubt bring Taiwan's economic development to a new

      <P>Henson went on to say that domestic reform to revise laws is also

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER CHANG ORDERS REVIEW OF MUDSLIDE PREVENTION NEAR SCHOOLS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  1  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung said Monday he
will direct relevant government agencies to conduct a comprehensive
review of measures to prevent mudslides near schools in mountainous
regions.</P>
      <P>Chang made the remarks during an inspection tour of the National
Taipei Institute of the Arts (NTIA), whose sports facilities were
destroyed Sept. 29 by mudslides triggered by protracted rains over
the past week.</P>
      <P>The arts institute is located on the side of a hill in the Peitou
district in northern Taipei. A junior high school adjacent to the
institute was also partially damaged by rocks and mud at roughly the
same time.</P>
      <P>Chang said the government already has measures in place to
address the issues of mudslides and flooding near schools on
hillsides, but since Taiwan was rattled by a 7.3-magnitude earthquake
on Sept. 21, 1999 and after several devastating typhoons hit in the
following years, government research data is now out of date.</P>
      <P>"In the past couple of years, some places where rockslides and
mudslides occurred were not included on the existing list of
mudslides-prone areas," Chang explained, adding that the NTIA, for
instance, was not on the list.</P>
      <P>"We need to conduct an overall review to ensure the safety of all
of our schools," Chang said, adding that the Taipei City Government
must take precautionary measures to protect private homes near the
two schools from being hit by rocks or mud.</P>
      <P>Chang said the Ministry of Education, the Council of Agriculture,
the Public Construction Commission and other relevant government
agencies should join forces to examine ways to protect against
mudslides and to recommend other safety measures for schools on
hillsides and in mountainous areas around the island.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chang said, the government is on high alert for a
possible military retaliation by the United States for the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks that brought down New York City's World Trade
Center and partially damaged the Pentagon.</P>
      <P>"Relevant government agencies are closely monitoring developments
of the general world situation and we will take the necessary
measures to tackle the changing situation," he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC URGED TO KEEP ALERT ON BEIJING'S POSSIBLE SABOTAGE OF U.S. TIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  1  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Two opposition Kuomintang lawmakers urged
the Republic of China government Monday to keep alert on the
possibility that Beijing takes advantage of the U.S.-led
anti-terrorism campaign to sabotage substantive ROC-U.S. relations.</P>
      <P>Fan Yang-shang, a convener of the Legislative Yuan's Foreign
Affairs Committee, said the United States and Britain reportedly
will soon launch attacks on terror camps in Afghanistan in
retaliation for terrorist assaults on U.S. soil Sept. 11.</P>
      <P>"The government should pay heed to mainland China's reaction as
it may take advantage of the incident to sabotage Taiwan's relations
with the United States," Fan warned.</P>
      <P>Kwan Yuk-noan, another convener of the legislature's Foreign
Affairs Committee, echoed Fan's views, saying that as mainland China
has traditionally maintained good relations with Afghanistan and
neighboring Pakistan, it has clout in the current U.S.-led
anti-terrorism campaign.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, Kwan said, the ROC government should
exercise prudence in handling relations across the Taiwan Strait and
ties with the United States at this critical moment.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, officials with the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) said they generally do not think that the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks would have any significant impact on cross-strait
relations.</P>
      <P>But both Tien Hsin, director of the DPP's international affairs
department, and Yen Chien-fa, director of the DPP's mainland China
affairs department, agreed that Taiwan should keep a close watch on
the possible impact of post-terrorist attacks developments
on the U.S. global strategy.</P>

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The number of employed workers during the
first seven months of this year in Taiwan was down 2.95 percent from
the same period a year ago, the largest decline in 20 years for the
January-July period, according to government statistics.</P>
      <P>The figure also represents an 11-consecutive month fall, or a
reduction of 280,000 people in the nation's entire workforce as
compared to June and a fifth such shrinkage over the past 20 years,
the tallies released recently by the Cabinet-level Directorate
General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) show.</P>
      <P>Affected by the Asian financial crisis which occurred in the
second half of 1997, the number of the country's workforce fell by
1.05 percent in 1998 during the seven-month period, while it also
dropped by 0.5 percent in 1996 due to a sluggish local economy and
the war games by mainland China in the Taiwan Strait, the DGBAS
detailed, adding that a 1.12 percent fall was posted in 1990 owning
to a global recession.</P>
      <P>At the same time, the average regular monthly working hours of
local employed workers during the same seven-month period was down
9.5 hours from a year ago to 170.2 hours, resulting in an actual
monthly income of NT$32,983 per capita, a slight increase of 1.04

    <HEADLINE>SOLUTION IN SIGHT OVER DISPUTE ABOUT NAME OF SINA BASKETBALL TEAM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Oct.   1   (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A basketball team financed by
Chinese-language Internet service provider, Sina.com, might compete
in mainland China's National Basketball League using a name without
the words "Taiwan" or "Taipei," a move which could placate Taiwan
authorities, according to a top sports official in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Wang Jen-cheng, president of the Chinese Taipei Basketball
Association, said Sunday that the China Basketball Management
Center, which runs the league, has agreed with his proposal to drop
"Taipei" or "Taiwan" before it competes in the Chinese National
League.</P>
      <P>The concession will spare the team, consisting of mainly
Taiwanese players, the dilemma of choosing to play either in Taiwan
or in mainland China.</P>
      <P>The team, founded on Dec. 7, 2000 in Taiwan, has sought to play
in the top-ranking A league of the Chinese league, but was required
by the China Basketball Management Center to chose a name that showed
where the team called home.</P>
      <P>However, names including the word "Taiwan" or "Taipei," as
proposed by the team, were rejected by Taiwan's Mainland Affairs
Council and the National Council on Physical Fitness and Sports on
the grounds that it might boost Beijing's claims that Taiwan is a
part of its territory.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the two government agencies said Taiwan professional
basketball players are not allowed to play games in mainland China
under the existing rules.</P>
      <P>Annoyed by the decision by Taipei authorities, Daniel Chiang,
president of the E-Ternational Sports Ventures Co., which owns the
team, threatened Sept. 28 to stop playing in Taiwan and shift the
team's base to Suzhou, Jiangsu province.</P>
      <P>In the latest twist in the dispute, Wang said Sunday that at his
urging, the China Basketball Management Center has agreed to give up
its requirement for Sina to name its team after Taiwan or Taipei. In
this way, Wang said, the friendly exchanges between the two sides in
the sport of basketball would be maintained.</P>
      <P>This deal, however, is still subject to the approval of Beijing's
State Administration of Physical Culture and Sports, and the Taiwan
Affairs Office under the State Council, or the counterparts of
Taipei's National Council on Physical Fitness and Sports and Mainland
Affairs Council, Wang said.</P>
      <P>Beijing's government offices were closed for the Middle Autumn
Festival Monday and the situation will remain unclear until Tuesday,
Wang said.</P>
      <P>Chiang was in the United States Monday and could not be reached
for comment. However, Tu Teh-yen, executive director of
E-Ternational, said in Taipei that the Sina team would be glad to
stay in Taiwan if it can compete in mainland China without using
Taiwan or Taipei in its name.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN WILL ATTEND APEC SUMMIT WITH DIGNITY: GIO CHIEF</HEADLINE>

(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Government Information Office
Director-General Su Tzen-ping said Monday that Taipei hopes to attend
the Oct. 20-21 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum in
Shanghai with dignity.</P>
      <P>He stressed that as Taiwan is a member economy of APEC, it is
unlikely that Taiwan would be absent from the annual meeting,
although some officials have suggested that the possibility could not
be excluded that Taiwan might be absent.</P>
      <P>The customary practice for APEC is that the host country sends a
special envoy to present the invitation to the president of a member
economy to attend the informal leadership conference.</P>
      <P>However, this year mainland China, the host country, failed to
follow this practice, and instead it sent the invitation to Taipei
via fax in May.</P>
      <P>To address this situation, the Presidential Office, the National
Security Council, the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs have held several rounds of meetings.</P>
      <P>As the date for the meeting is just around the corner, the GIO
chief said that Taiwan was still engaging in positive negotiations
with Beijing with a hope that President Chen Shui-bian will be able
to attend the informal leadership conference.</P>
      <P>"Our goal is very clear -- to attend the forum with dignity," Su
stressed.</P>
      <P>He expressed the hope that Beijing will make a decision on the
issue as soon as possible so that Taiwan's interest will not be hurt.</P>
      <P>Because Taiwan is a formal APEC member, Su said that it seems
unlikely that Taiwan will boycott the meeting.</P>
      <P>When asked who will represent Chen at the leadership
conference if Beijing refuses to allow Chen to attend the meeting, Su
said: "It is too early to talk about the appointment of a
representative as we are making positive negotiations for Chen's
participation."</P>
      <P>Last year, Central Bank of China Governor Perng Fai-nan
represented Chen at the APEC summit in Brunei.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT TO BE NO LONGER TOLERANT OF FORMER CHAIRMAN LEE'S  CRITICISM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct.1 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Kuomintang (KMT) will not be embroiled in
a war of words against its former chief, Lee Teng-hui, but will no
longer be as respectful of Lee as it used to be, said a KMT senior
officials Monday.</P>
      <P>That means the KMT might respond to Lee's criticism of the party
by contradicting his current statements with those he made in the
past, although KMT Chairman Lien Chan, who was the target of Lee's
salvoes on Sunday, will not himself fire back against Lee's
lambasting.</P>
      <P>On a whistle stop for candidates of the Taiwan Solidarity Union
(TSU) in Chiayi, southern Taiwan, Lee, without mentioning Lien's
name, said a presidential candidate who has earned a Ph. D. degree in
political science has exposed his total ignorance of politics by
trying to oust an elected president though a recall simply because of
his unwillingness to resign himself to his defeat in an election.</P>
      <P>Lien is the only candidate with a Ph.D. in political science --
obtained from Chicago University -- who was in the 2000 race for
presidency, and his candidacy was endorsed by Lee, who was KMT
chairman then.</P>
      <P>In Sunday's speech, Lee said he rued the day he entered the KMT,
not the least his 12-year tenure as KMT chairman, saying it was a
period of time when he rubbed shoulders with "a group of rascals."</P>
      <P>The KMT has tried to give Lee his due respect, although the party
revoked his membership on Sept. 21 after Lee intensified his rhetoric
against the party while stumping for TSU candidates. The KMT's new
stance toward Lee is mindful of the upcoming year-end elections for
lawmakers and county magistrates.</P>
      <P>The KMT's departure from its previous tolerance toward Lee was
marked Monday by an editorial in the party's mouthpiece, the Central
Daily News, which cited Lee's conflicting statements about Lien
before and after Lee's falling out with the party, saying it proved
that Lee was either "without insight" then or "without judgment" now.</P>

      <P>Mandarin Airlines announced Tuesday that it
will kick off flight services on two additional international routes
despite the sluggish economy.</P>
      <P>Mandarin Airlines will this Thursday begin flight services
between Taipei and Katmandu, the capital of Nepal. Initially, the
airline will offer one flight every Thursday, but it said it hopes to
increase services on this route to two to three flights per week.</P>
      <P>Mandarin Airlines officials noted that Nepal is an ancient
kingdom rich in religious and cultural color, adding that the months
between October and March are the dry season in that country, which
they said should attract a lot of Taiwan tourists.</P>
      <P>In addition, the airline will on Oct. 9 kick off direct flight

    <HEADLINE>ROC PRESIDENT UNLIKELY ABLE TO ATTEND APEC SUMMIT: U.S. SCHOLARS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New  York, Oct. 1 (CNA)
(By Eric C.Y. Tseng and Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>U.S. scholars said Monday at a seminar at
Columbia University that Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian
is unlikely to be able to attend the Oct. 20-21 Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) forum informal leadership summit in Shanghai.</P>
      <P>Thomas Bernstein, a political science professor who served as
moderator for the seminar, said that because the United States
currently needs the support of a big country like mainland China in
its campaign against terrorism, he believes that Washington will
yield to Beijing's wishes in the end and withhold support for Chen's
participation in the annual APEC summit.</P>
      <P>Most of the approximately 30 professors and graduate students at
the university's East Asian Institute who attended the seminar said
that they agreed with Bernstein's viewpoint.</P>
      <P>Political science professor Andrew J. Nathan said that he does
not believe U.S. President George W. Bush will mention Taipei-Beijing
relations during his upcoming visit to Shanghai to attend the APEC
meeting because he is busy putting together a global anti-terrorism
alliance.</P>
      <P>However, Nathan added that he believes Bush will unlikely
sacrifice Taiwan's interests just to accomplish his goal of
consolidating the anti-terrorism alliance.</P>
      <P>ROC presidential national policy adviser Byron S.J. Weng, who was
invited to the seminar, said that Beijing failed to follow
traditional APEC protocol in the delivery of an invitation to the ROC
president to attend the summit, but that subsequent negotiations have
progressed to the stage where Beijing has agreed to send a formal
invitation after Taipei decides on a proxy to attend in Chen's place.</P>
      <P>Chen has been adamant about participating in the APEC summit in
person this year. In previous years, the president has always been
represented by an appointed proxy because of Beijing's insistence.
This is the first time that an APEC summit is being held in mainland
China.</P>
      <P>In the past, the host country had consistently sent a special
envoy to Taipei to present a formal invitation to the ROC president
to attend the summit, but this year, Beijing only faxed a brief
notice of the summit meeting to Taiwan in May.</P>
      <P>The notice did not include the name of the intended recipient and
only asked Taipei's senior APEC official to forward the message to
concerned bodies.</P>
      <P>APEC is one of the few international organizations that
simultaneously admits Taiwan and mainland China. A regional forum
dedicated to promoting free trade and investment, its members include
Australia, Brunei, Canada, mainland China, Chile, Hong Kong,
Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua
New Guinea, Peru, the Philippines, Russia, Singapore, Taiwan,
Thailand, the United States and Vietnam.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MND APPROVES KIDD-CLASS DESTROYERS PROCUREMENT PLAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  2 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of National Defense (MND) has
approved a Navy plan to purchase four Kidd-class destroyers from the
United States to help beef up the Republic of China's naval defense
capability, military spokesman Huang Suey-sheng said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>According to Huang, the MND has given the green light only after
a careful evaluation found that the destroyers could meet the ROC
Navy's combat needs.</P>
      <P>Also approved was the purchase of an unspecified number of
Standard II air defense missiles to equip the four Kidd-class
destroyers, Huang said.</P>
      <P>With a view to winning legislative and popular support for the
warship procurement plan, Huang said, the MND will brief legislators
and watchdog Control Yuan members on its assessment results in the
near future.</P>
      <P>The United States agreed to sell Taiwan four of its Kidd-class
destroyers in an annual bilateral meeting held in Washington in April
on Taiwan's defense needs and its arms procurement plan.</P>
      <P>Huang said the office of Chief of the General Staff (CGS) Gen.
Tang Yao-ming approved the ROC Navy request last week to purchase the
U.S.-built destroyers.</P>
      <P>The CGS office then presented the procurement project to Defense
Minister Wu Shih-wen for final approval, Huang said, adding that Wu
gave the nod in consideration of mainland China's mounting military
threat and the ROC Navy's overall combat strategy.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Huang said, Wu demanded that the CGS office and the
Navy General Headquarters continue lobbying the United States to sell
the even more advanced Aegis radar-equipped destroyers to Taiwan
following the island's purchase of the four Kidd-class destroyers
built almost 20 years ago. In addition, Wu was quoted as having
ordered relevant military authorities to pay heed to the four
warships' future maintenance costs.</P>
      <P>The ROC Navy now must complete two more procedures before the
sale can go through. The first is a comprehensive analysis of the
Kidd-class destroyer and its weaponry systems. The second is the
preparation of a budget to allow for the procurement plan worth an
estimated NT$25 billion (US$724.64 million). Both steps are expected
to take several months to finalize.</P>
      <P>MND sources said funds for the purchase are expected to be
included in the 2003 budget bill. The MND's spending plans for fiscal
2002 have already been set and no extra funds are available, the
sources said.</P>
      <P>ROC Navy officials were initially divided over whether to
purchase the Kidd-class destroyers.</P>
      <P>Navy Commander-in-Chief Li Chieh apparently supported the plan to
buy the 9,000-ton destroyers on the grounds that the warships could
largely upgrade the Navy's ability to project force on the open seas.
However, opponents said the Kidd-class destroyers are simply too big
to suit Taiwan's needs, preferring instead to see the Navy buy
smaller warships. After a lengthy tug of war, the Li camp won. A
formal procurement request was presented to the CGS office in August.</P>
      <P>MND sources said Li was able to win partly because of his efforts
in seeking the support of members of the Legislative Yuan's Defense
Committee. Li reportedly had sent a subordinate to brief each member
of the legislative defense committee on the navy's plan to buy the
Kidd-class destroyers.</P>
      <P>The sources said the legislators were told that the navy mostly
plans to deploy the destroyers east of Taiwan, rather than in the
Taiwan Strait. According to the sources, the strategy is aimed at
expanding the navy's range of operations on the open seas, which the
navy said would be good for Taiwan from a long-term perspective.</P>
      <P>Li himself also once told local reporters that the Kidd-class
destroyers would be deployed as flagships for flexible missions on
the open seas to help check mainland China's maritime combat
operations.</P>
      <P>The Kidd-class destroyers are equipped with radar systems that
have an effective range of 350 kilometers and can fire four
anti-aircraft missiles simultaneously within a range of 70
kilometers.</P>
      <P>Although Kidd-class destroyers are almost 20 years old,
military sources said, they still have "plenty of useful life
yet." More important, they carry a price tag of only about one sixth
of that of a new vessel.</P>
      <P>The Kidd-class destroyers were originally built for use by Iran
during the reign of the Shah, but the U.S. Navy took control of the
ships in 1981 and 1982 after Iran's revolutionary Islamic regime took
power. The destroyers, currently mothballed, will be ready for
delivery by 2003.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIPEI MAYOR ANNOUNCES ESTABLISHMENT OF RECONSTRUCTION COMMITTEE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  2  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou on Tuesday
announced the establishment of a post-Typhoon Nari reconstruction
committee.</P>
      <P>Mayor Ma said that the committee will conduct an overall review
of the causes behind the heavy casualties and property losses in the
typhoon, as well as study disaster prevention, rescue and relief, and
post-disaster reconstruction systems, with the results and
conclusions to be provided for reference.</P>
      <P>The committee will be headed by former vice premier Liu
Chao-shiuan, while Taipei Deputy Mayor Ou Chin-der will serve as the
vice chairman.</P>
      <P>Ma lauded Liu, who held an important post during the
reconstruction work in the wake of the killer magnitude 7.3 quake
that struck the island Sept. 21, 1999, and who presided over several
major projects in the National Science Council, for having rich
experience in disaster relief work.</P>
      <P>The committee will spend a month studying substantial measures to
improve the disaster prevention and rescue and relief systems in
Taipei. The conclusions reached by the committee will be put into
practice within three months at the latest to speed up reconstruction
in the wake of the devastation brought by Nari two weeks ago.</P>
      <P>The reconstruction committee will be divided into four groups,
with one group studying disaster prevention and relief systems,
another studying floodwater prevention and water drainage systems, a
third looking into traffic and mass rapid transit systems, and
another studying disaster prevention on hilly terrain in Taipei City.</P>
      <P>The group studying traffic and mass rapid transit systems will
have Taipei Deputy Mayor Ou serve as its head, while the other three
groups will have scholars and experts to serve as conveners.</P>
      <P>Ma said that he is hoping that the scholars and experts can
conduct an objective study and discover some of the problems Taipei
City Government has overlooked in the past.</P>
      <P>Typhoon Nari, which hit Taiwan Sept. 16-18, brought record levels
of rainfall to the island, triggering serious flooding in many places
in Taipei. The floodwaters caused the city's mass rapid transit
system to become partially paralyzed, with service on most lines only
being resumed this week.</P>
      <P>In addition, residents in many parts of Taipei had to endure long
periods of power outages and suspension of water supply as result of
the typhoon.</P>

    <HEADLINE>OPPOSITION LAWMAKERS THREATEN TO REJECT 2002 FISCAL BUDGET DRAFT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  2  (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition party lawmakers on Tuesday
threatened to send the draft of the 2002 fiscal budget back to the
Executive Yuan, saying that the budget's estimated total tax revenue
is based on an unrealistic 4.2 percent annual economic growth rate.</P>
      <P>After Premier Chang Chun-hsiung submitted his fiscal budget
report to the Legislative Yuan in the morning, New Party lawmaker Lai
Shyh-bao called a news conference to say that government revenues for
fiscal 2002 are overestimated by nearly NT$100 billion (US$2.9
billion) because the Executive Yuan based its calculations on a
figure that was far higher than the World Bank's estimate of one
percent annual economic growth for industrialized nations.</P>
      <P>Lai charged that revenues were overestimated by NT$5 billion
(US$145 million) in income taxes, NT$5 billion in tariffs, NT$10
billion (US$289 million) in commodity taxes, NT$30 billion (US$868
million) in securities transaction taxes, NT$30 billion in business
taxes and NT$5 billion in profits from public properties.</P>
      <P>In the expenditure portion, Lai accused the Executive Yuan of
illegally including a new budget item earmarking NT$15 billion
(US$434 million) for senior citizen subsidies, saying the move lacks
a legal basis.</P>
      <P>He added that the Executive Yuan might as well take the draft
budget back and put together a corrected version instead of
submitting an "untruthful" one.</P>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang Legislator Tina W.K. Pan also demanded that
the draft budget be revised to correct the alleged overestimates.</P>
      <P>In response, ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
Legislative Whip Tsai Huang-liang said that it would be irresponsible
to demand that the draft budget be sent back to the Executive Yuan
before the Legislative Yuan has even allowed the premier to respond
to the charges of the opposition lawmakers in an interpellation
session.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, DPP lawmaker Hong Chi-chang admitted that the draft
budget "indeed failed to reflect reality" by not accounting for the
economic after-effects of the terrorist attacks on America and the
devastation caused to Taiwan by two recent typhoons.</P>
      <P>However, Hong said that "the economy is dynamic" and that
legislators have the duty to evaluate the draft budget instead of
demanding that a new budget be prepared.</P>
      <P>Premier Chang's budget report to the Legislative Yuan estimates
that Taiwan's annual economic growth rate could reach 4.2 percent in
2002 in part due to several factors, including a gradual recovery in
global economic prospects, Taiwan's impending accession to the World
Trade Organization and an expected resumption of growth in the export
sector.</P>
      <P>Chang's report also listed private investment in the Taiwan
High-Speed Railway, the auctioning of third-generation (3G) cellular
phone licenses, the construction of private-sector power plants, and
the development of large industrial and commercial zones as likely
stimulants for the domestic economy.</P>
      <P>The draft budget lists approximately NT$1.3 trillion (US$37.6
billion) in total government revenues and about NT$1.5 trillion
(US$43.4 billion) in expenditures. After taking government debt
obligations into account, the fiscal deficit stands at approximately
NT$350 billion (US$10.1 billion).</P>

    <HEADLINE>III TO SPONSOR SEMINAR ON PATENTS AND RELATED LEGAL ISSUES</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei, Oct. 2 (CNA): The Science and Technology Law Center of
the Institute for Information Industry (III) will sponsor a seminar
on patents and related legal issues Thursday in Taipei to advise
local manufacturers of international practices in patent rights.</P>
      <P>A spokesman of the law center said Tuesday that the patent
infringement lawsuits between Taiwan's semiconductor manufacturer Via
Technologies and Intel Corporation have alerted local manufacturers
to the potential problems with patent rights.</P>
      <P>He said that Samsung Corp. of South Korea has set up an office in
Taiwan to take up legal action against suspected patent infringements
by Taiwan manufacturers. As a matter of fact, since early this year,
patent related legal issues involving Taiwan manufacturers have
increased considerably, he added.</P>
      <P>In the past decade, international corporations in the United
States and Europe have been paying more attention to legal and
intellectual property rights. The computer giant IBM, for instance,
has applied for 27,000 patent rights in the United States and its
revenues from royalties and penalties amount to NT$1 billion
annually, according to the law center.</P>
      <P>To promote the awareness of patent rights and related issues,
business executives from the software, communications, information
appliance, and e-business sectors formed the "e-Patent Technological
Alliance" on Dec. 4, 2000.</P>
      <P>The law center will invite specialists of the Industrial
Delopment Bureau and consultants from law firms to speak on
international practices in patent rights applications at the seminar.</P>
      <P>The spokesman said that facing patent infringement lawsuits in a
foreign land could be very troublesome because there are many
incalculable factors involved. He suggested that local manufacturers
acquaint themselves with patent-related issues before starting a
research and development project, in advance of the production of a
new design, and prior to the signing of technical cooperation
agreements with a counterpart.</P>
      <P>In the event that a company becomes embroiled in a patent
infringement lawsuit, the spokesman said that even the choice of
where the case will be tried can be key to the success or failure of
the suit.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Lien Chan, chairman of the opposition
Kuomintang, on Tuesday urged his predecessor Lee Teng-hui to show
"restraint" in his words and not let everyone "lose face."</P>
      <P>Lien made the remarks in Chiayi, southern Taiwan, when he called
on Chiayi County Magistrate Lee Yah-ching and invited him to
represent the KMT in running in the year-end legislative elections.</P>
      <P>On Lee's remarks over the past few days while stumping for
candidates of the recently-formed Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) for
the year-end elections, Lien said that one should "let bygones be
bygones."</P>
      <P>He also said that Lee, who served as Republic of China president
for 12 years and who is a self-proclaimed devout Christian, has gone
on tirades and made several personal attacks recently, which Lien
said does set a bad example for others, especially children.</P>
      <P>Lien expressed the hope that Lee will restrain himself more and
not fire salvoes everywhere and avoid making everyone "lose face."</P>
      <P>Lee, without mentioning the name of Lien, recently said that a
presidential candidate who had earned a doctorate in political
science has demonstrated a total ignorance of politics by trying to
kick out an elected president through a recall simply because he
could not accept his defeat in an election.</P>
      <P>Lee also lashed out at Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou for his
performance in the wake of Typhoon Nari Sept. 16-18, which resulted
in heavy casualties and property losses, by criticizing Ma for being
"good at shows, but not good at doing things."</P>
      <P>The KMT, after a long period of deliberation, stripped Lee, who
had served as KMT chairman for 12 years, of his membership in the
party and began to draw a line between itself and its former chief.</P>
      <P>Lee, responding to having his KMT membership revoked, said that
he rued the day he entered the KMT and that his 12-year stint as KMT
head was a period of time when he rubbed shoulders with "a group of
rascals."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei, Oct. 2 (CNA): An evaluation report of the China External
Trade Development Council (Cetra) released Tuesday said that Taiwan's
garment manufacturers will face fiercer competition from their
counterparts in mainland China and other low-wage regions when Taiwan
is admitted into the World Trade Organization (WTO).</P>
      <P>The report indicated that the WTO quota restrictions on garment
imports are expected to be canceled among WTO member states by the
year of 2005. As a labor-intensive industry, Taiwan's garment
manufacturing sector will inevitably lose its international
competitiveness.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, the report said, the capital and
technology-intensive man-made fiber sector can expect better market
prospects with no quota restrictions.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is the world's third-largest supplier of man-made fibers,
next only to the United States and mainland China.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's textile exports amounted to US$15.2 billion last year.
Exports of sweaters and T-shirts dropped considerably from the level
of the previous year, according to statistics compiled by the Taiwan
Textile Federation.</P>
      <P>The Cetra report said that Taiwan has continued to lower import
tariffs and to reduce non-tariff barriers, while import restrictions
remain rigid in many aspects in mainland China. WTO memberships for
both sides of the Taiwan Straits may stimulate the growth of
cross-strait trade, the report said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China was present for the
first time at a Russia-sponsored international investment forum aimed
at forging economic integration between Russia's Far East and the
Asia-Pacific region.</P>
      <P>S. Y. Tso, chief of the trade session with the ROC representative
office in Russia, took part in the gathering held in Khabarovsk in
Russia's Far East Sept. 19-20. The forum on Northeast Asian
investment was initiated by the Russian authorities and organized by
the Russian committee under the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
(APEC).</P>
      <P>According to Tsao, the forum was meant to clear the way to push
for international cooperation between Russia's Far East and
Asia-Pacific countries on the transportation and energy sectors.</P>
      <P>Forum organizers put forth two major blueprints on building and
renewing transportation networks linking European and Asian
continents and on constructing pipelines to transport natural gas
from Russia's Far East to Northeast Asian countries, Tsao said.</P>
      <P>As it was the first time that ROC officials have participated in
such an international gathering hosted by Russia and Tsao said the
prime purpose of his mission at the forum was to collect related
information to serve as reference for relevant ROC government
agencies.</P>
      <P>But he noted that the Russian side had failed to respond to a
request by the ROC representative office to open a trade mission in
Vladivostok to serve fishermen and business people from Taiwan in
that city.</P>
      <P>In addition to Russian officials, mainland China and Japan also
dispatched officials and experts to the forum.</P>

      <P>The Republic of China Air Force has
intensified its nighttime combat training, weaponry systems
integration and tactical training, a senior officer in the air force
said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Maj. Gen. Yen Ming, head of the operations division of the Air
Force General Headquarters, made the remarks while briefing media on
the air force's working agenda for the second half of this year.</P>
      <P>Yen said the priority of the air force's current training program
is to upgrade its F-16 fleet's overall nighttime combat capabilities
in the shortest possible time.</P>
      <P>In the first half of this year, Yen said, the air force has seen
progress in upgrading its weapons, manpower training and risk
management.</P>
      <P>By the end of June, Yen said, the air force had completed
training of seed instructors for airborne and ground service
personnel who will be tasked with learning how to operate newly

    <HEADLINE>NICARAGUA PUSHES FOR TAIWAN'S MEMBERSHIP AT U.N. DEBATE ON TERRORISM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New  York,  Oct.  1 (CNA)
(By Eric Tseng, Jay Chen, and Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government of Nicaragua made a plea
Monday for Taiwan's membership during a United Nations General
Assembly debate on terrorism, but a U.S. Department of State
spokesman said he hoped the debate would concentrate on the issue of
terrorism.</P>
      <P>Nicaraguan Foreign Relations Minister Francisco Aguirre, who was
the first speaker in the week-long debate, told the General Assembly
that the "universal calling of our organization" to defeat terrorism
cannot be complete "as long as there is a state with profound
democratic roots that cannot participate in the full work of the
United Nations' system."</P>
      <P>He said: "I am referring to the Republic of China, Taiwan."</P>
      <P>The General Assembly was called to unite U.N. members into a
coalition against terrorism after terrorists crashed two hijacked
commercial planes into the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center in
New York and crashed a third plane into the Pentagon in Arlington,
Virginia on Sept. 11.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Richard Boucher, a spokesman for the U.S. Department
of State said in Washington that he thought the General Assembly's
meeting should concentrate on the issue of terrorism and the steps
that people can take against terrorism, and that other issues should
not be introduced.</P>
      <P>But he said at a news briefing that he expected various
statements to emerge from the debate because people have different
views on the situation.</P>
      <P>After being pressed by a reporter for the U.S. government's
opinion on Taiwan's participation in the coalition, the spokesman
referred him to "everything we have said before," adding that the
Department of State has addressed the issue numerous times. "We have
a standard policy and it hasn't changed," the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>The U.N. voted in 1971 to give the ROC's seat to mainland China.</P>
      <P>The ROC has tried since 1993 to have its membership reinstated
through its diplomatic allies. They have regularly asked the Assembly
to debate the issue but have failed thus far to put the issue on the
agenda because of opposition from Beijing, which claims sovereignty
over Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Nicaragua was one of 10 countries which raised the issue of
Taiwan's bid to join the U.N. before the start of the General
Assembly earlier this year, but mainland China nixed the idea Aug.
16.</P>

    <HEADLINE>RULING DPP ANNOUNCES DRAFT RESOLUTION ON SUPPORTING TAIWAN ECONOMY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  2  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) vowed Tuesday in a party resolution to build a knowledge-based
economy and an efficient and clean government for the people of
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The DPP's Central Standing Committee approved the draft of the
five-point resolution which aims to "create a knowledge-based
economy, develop an open and liberal economy, build a prosperous and
equitable society, set up a clean government and become a greater
player in the global economy."</P>
      <P>Thanks to the sacrifice and contribution by the Taiwan people and
many steadfast supporters of democracy, the DPP was finally able to
accomplish Taiwan's first-ever power transfer between different
political parties in 2000, ending the one-party rule of more than 50
years by the Kuomintang on the island, the draft resolution states.</P>
      <P>Although the universal principles of democracy have taken root in
Taiwan, it says, the country must step up its efforts to reform its
economic structure and build a solid legal system in the face of the
challenges after the nation's entry in the World Trade Organization.
Taiwan will also have to adapt to the global trend toward trade
alliances.</P>
      <P>At this historic juncture for Taiwan society and its economy, the
DPP hopes to clarify its stance and viewpoints about Taiwan's current
situation and wishes to further cement the country's democratic
achievements and create a new economic miracle for the Taiwan people,
party members said.</P>
      <P>The draft resolution, containing 20 policies, will be submitted
to a national congress of DPP delegates for final approval on Oct.
20.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  2  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's oldest evening newspaper -- the
Independence Evening Post -- will pass into history Wednesday because
of long-term financial problems, ending 54 years in business.</P>
      <P>The labor union of the newspaper said that they will suspend all
operations after publishing a five-page final memorial issue on
Tuesday afternoon becuase they have "run out of bullets." Labor union
representatives apologized to the people of Taiwan for the decision
to close and vowed to continue fighting for the "Independence
spirit."</P>
      <P>The labor union took over the printing of the newspaper Sept. 14
after both former chairman Wang Shih-chien and the new boss, Chang
Fu-tai, declined to continue running the paper. As the newspaper has
no money to pay its overdue electricity bill and no other group
stepped forward to take over the paper, the labor union was forced to
make the closure announcement.</P>
      <P>A labor union official said they will continue with their protest
to get back the salaries and the labor and insurance payments owning
to them by the newspaper authorities. The labor union has decided to
hold a farewell "funeral" for the Independence Post on Oct. 10 -- its
founding day -- to highlight their demands.</P>
      <P>Wang lamented the closing, saying that he is willing to re-start
the newspaper should its staff seek his help.</P>
      <P>But Wang clarified that he is willing to take over the management
of the Independence Evening Post again only because of his passion
and personal feelings about the newspaper. "This has nothing to do
with the debts of the paper or the state of operations now," he
stressed.</P>
      <P>Wang had transferred the newspaper's management in a symbolic
gesture to a new team led by Chang in late July following a serious
labor-management row in which the working staff accused Wang of
embezzling as much as NT$8 million worth of their labor and insurance
payments and other money.</P>
      <P>Chang was not available for comment Tuesday night.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DEFENSE MINISTRY MUM ON REPORT OF U.S. MILITARY ASSESSMENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  2  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of National Defense (MND)
declined to make any comment Tuesday on a newspaper report that the
U.S. military has completed a "net assessment" of the Republic of
China Army's logistics and combat capabilities.</P>
      <P>MND spokesman Huang Suey-sheng said at a routine news conference
that it is the ministry's established policy to refrain from
explaining or commenting on military exchanges and cooperation with
other countries as well as any arms procurement issues.</P>
      <P>A local newspaper reported Tuesday that a U.S. military
delegation has finalized a so-called "Vanguard Project" report which
evaluates the ROC Army's strengths and weaknesses.</P>
      <P>Huang would not confirm whether there was such a project or not.
He instead said Taiwan and the United States have a long history of
military exchanges and cooperation.</P>
      <P>ROC military sources said the U.S. military sent delegations to
conduct a two-phase net assessment of the ROC Army's air-defense
skills in the field as well as its ability to repulse attack and the
combat abilities of the combined services over the past year.</P>
      <P>Net assessment is an evaluation method adopted by the U.S.
military to assess the strengths and weaknesses of a country's
military. It evaluates military capability using both qualitative and
quantitative factors.</P>
      <P>The net assessment report to be written on Taiwan is expected to
weigh heavily on the U.S. Pentagon's decisions concerning arm sales
to Taiwan's army in the years to come and Taiwan's possible role in
any Asia-Pacific security mechanisms, army sources said.</P>
      <P>According to the sources, the U.S. military also sent similar
delegations to Taiwan last year to evaluate the ROC Air Force and the
ROC Navy's weaponry needs.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, MND spokesman Huang said the ROC military has stepped
up its alert amid reports that the United States and Britain are
ready to launch attacks on terror camps in Afghanistan believed to
be controlled by Osama bin Laden, the prime suspect of the Sept.
11 terrorist assaults in New York and Washington.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Huang said, the ROC military will not heighten
its combat preparedness nor will it change its normal training
or working schedules.</P>
      <P>"We'll keep a close watch on the latest developments in the
U.S.-led anti-terrorism campaign and step up intelligence gathering
to prevent any contingencies," Huang said.</P>
      <P>He said the ROC Air Force has tightened security measures at its
air bases and major installations.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Huang said, the ROC military has formulated
a comprehensive package of measures to cope with possible biological
terrorist attacks. "We are capable of detecting and countering any
possible biological strikes," he added.</P>

      <P>More than 30 candidates for the upcoming
legislative elections signed up a self-discipline accord Tuesday
promising to make every possible effort to prevent their campaign
activities from polluting the domestic environment.</P>
      <P>The pollution-free campaign was initiated by 15 local
environmental groups, including the Homemakers' Union and
Foundation (HUF), the Taiwan Environmental Protection Alliance and
the Green Front Association.</P>
      <P>Five candidates for the legislative elections slated for Dec. 1,

      <P>Thirty-one other candidates already signed the self-discipline
accord last week, organizers said.</P>

living here.</P>
      <P>"We hope that legislative candidates will take the lead in
promoting environmental protection by committing themselves to
pollution-free campaign activities," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Under the self-discipline accord, the signatories must publicize
their campaign budget, use recycled paper for their campaign
literature, keep the number of their campaign banners under 5,000,
refrain from using disposable cups and bowls at their campaign
offices, clean up all garbage after every campaign rally, minimize
noise and do every effort to conserve resources.</P>
      <P>The signatories also promised that if they are elected, they
would push for legislation of an environmental protection law,

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China government is to
implement a new foreign labor policy within two weeks and has
informed several countries whose laborers could be affected, Council
of Labor Affairs (CLA) Chairwoman Chen Chu said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chen said that during the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum
labor ministers' meeting in Tokyo last week, she told labor affairs
ministers and vice ministers of Indonesia, the Philippines and
Thailand that the ROC government will soon revise its current foreign
labor policy to carry out a decision reached by consensus during the
Economic Development Advisory Conference in August.</P>
      <P>Stressing that "Taiwan's foreign labor policy cannot be
stationary in these changing times," Chen said it must be adjusted in
compliance with the country's overall labor market condition and
economic situation and in line with basic human rights.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan has the authority to make its own policy," she noted.</P>
      <P>The CLA chief vowed that foreign laborers will be fully protected
in Taiwan, as long as their mother countries accept Taiwan's new
measures. "If a country has difficulty accepting Taiwan's revised
rules, we will no longer import laborers from that country," she
added.</P>
      <P>Chen said she had made it clear to the Philippine vice labor
affairs minister that "Taiwan is opposed to de-linking wages of
Taiwan workers and foreign workers. We feel that both are subject to
the ROC law which stipulates that housing and food are covered in
their wages."</P>
      <P>According to Chen, the new measures are to be made public in two
weeks. Among the changes will be a raise in housing and food charges
for foreign workers and a decrease in the total number of workers
imported.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LOWER  THAN  EXPECTED  GROWTH  WILL  NOT  RENDER  BUDGET  INFEASIBLE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 2 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government's budget as planned for next
year will still be feasible even if economic growth fails to live up
to expectations, Premier Chang Chung-hsiung said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>In a defense of the government's 2002 budget, which was prepared
based on a projected economic growth rate of 4.2 percent next year,
the premier told the Legislative Yuan that this projection was made
in July and might be a little bit too optimistic since it failed to
foresee the economic fallout from the terrorists attacks in New York
and Washington on Sept. 11.</P>
      <P>However, economic growth is only one of many factors taken into
account by government planners in shaping the budget, he said. Even
if the actual growth is less than expected, the proposed budget
should be possible, Chang said.</P>
      <P>The 4.2 percent projection was listed in the government's written
report on its budget but was omitted in the premier's verbal report
to the legislature because the basis on which it was forecast changed
after the Sept. 11 attacks.</P>
      <P>The terrorists attacks in the United States and their subsequent
after effects have driven down almost every stock index in the world
and have clouded the already gloomy prospect for global economic
recovery.</P>
      <P>In an attempt to gauge the economic impacts of the attacks,
U.S.-based Wharton Econometric Forecasting Associates predicted on
Sept. 21 that Taiwan's economy will post a moderate growth of 1.6
percent next year -- far short of the projection by Taipei officials.</P>
      <P>Several opposition lawmakers have asked the Legislative Yuan to
return the budget to the Executive Yuan to review because it failed to
take into account the government's need to carry out recommendations
made by the Economic Development Advisory Conference, and the relief
necessary after the destruction caused by typhoons Toraji, Nari and
Lekima. The lawmakers also pointed to the uncertainty arising from
the Sept. 11 attacks in the United States.</P>
      <P>In his response, Chang assured the lawmakers that the
government's budget is sufficient to cover the needs for all the
tasks despite the fact that the budget plan was made well before the
economic conference and the typhoons.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The risk of mad cow disease making its way
to Taiwan is very low, a Council of Agriculture (COA) official said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chiang Yi-nan, a COA official in charge of the quarantine of
animals and plants, made the remark in response to the outbreak of
the disease recently in Japan.</P>
      <P>Chiang said that because Taiwan has prohibited the use of animal
bone meal to feed ruminant animals since 1990, the risk of mad cow
disease entering the island is very small.</P>
      <P>He said Japan was originally a high-risk area for mad cow disease
because it had not banned the use of bone meal in animal feed until
after the disease appeared in the country, Chiang said.</P>
      <P>The COA official said that the mad cow disease virus can exist
within animal bone meal and that if ruminant animals such as cattle
and sheep eat contaminated feed, the disease will spread rapidly.</P>
      <P>Although the risk of mad cow disease entering Taiwan is very low,
the COA and other governmental departments have formed an emergency
task force to prevent Taiwan from being affected by the disease.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC SPACE SCIENTIST ELECTED IAA MEMBER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Paris,  Oct.  2  (CNA)
(By M. J. Tsou and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Dr. Chern Jeng-shing, an official with the
Republic of China's Cabinet-level National Science Council (NSC), was
was recently elected a member of the prestigious International
Academy of Astronautics (IAA).</P>
      <P>Chern, currently a project manager with the NSC's National Space
Program Office (NSPO), was conferred with a membership certificate
from the IAA in a ceremony held at the IAA's Paris headquarters Sept.
30, with IAA Chairman Michael Yarymovych presiding.</P>
      <P>Chern was the second scientist from Taiwan to be elected as an
IAA member, following Prof. Yeh Yung-heng from National Central
University being selected several years ago.</P>
      <P>The IAA elected Chern and Yeh as members of the prestigious
institute in recognition of their outstanding performance in and
contributions to their respective fields within the astronautics
sciences. Their being elected as IAA members also automatically made
Taiwan a member country of the academy, IAA sources said.</P>
      <P>Chern, who graduated from Taiwan's National Cheng Kung University
and later obtained his doctorate in space science from a university
in Michigan in the United States, was elected an IAA member to-be in
1997 and became a full member two days ago.</P>
      <P>He joined the military-run Chungshan Institute of Science and
Technology as a researcher soon after he received his doctorate in
1979. In a two-decade endeavor, he climbed the ladder of success from
being a researcher to becoming a project manager with the NSPO, which
oversees and executes Taiwan's 15-year space technology development
program launched in 1991.</P>
      <P>According to Chern, who is currently in the city of Toulouse in
southern France attending an international space science league
meeting, the building of an observation satellite, which is a part of
the ROCSAT-2 Project, in a space industrial center in Toulouse has
almost been completed.</P>
      <P>The observation satellite, designed and manufactured by Astrium,
a European consortium, is currently being tested and assembled, Chern
said, adding that if everything goes smoothly, the satellite for
scientific observation is expected to be shipped to Taiwan at the
beginning of 2002 and then launched into orbit by a U.S. spacecraft
company.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC PLEDGES SUPPORT FOR U.N. ANTI-TERRORISM RESOLUTION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  3  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung declared at a
weekly Cabinet meeting Wednesday that the Republic of China
government supports a U.N. anti-global terrorism resolution passed
on Sept. 28.</P>
      <P>Chang also reiterated the ROC's condemnation of the
Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in the United States that toppled the twin
towers of New York City's World Trade Center and partially
damaged the Pentagon -- the seat of the U.S. military nerve center.</P>
      <P>Chang said the ROC government will adopt a series of judicial and
administrative measures in tandem with its domestic law and the
spirit of various U.N.-sponsored anti-terrorism conventions and
resolutions to deny money, support and sanctuary to terrorists.</P>
      <P>The ROC will also step up exchanges of "operational
information," especially regarding the actions and movements of
terrorists, with other countries as well as provide all necessary
assistance in relevant investigation and criminal suit procedures.</P>
      <P>Chang said although the ROC has been shut out of the United
Nations since 1971 simply because of political reasons, it will
never waver its support for the global anti-terrorism campaign.</P>
      <P>In a significant international response to the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks, the U.N. Security Council (UNSC) unanimously
approved last Friday a resolution requiring all 189 U.N.-member
nations to deny money, support and sanctuary to terrorists.</P>
      <P>The legally binding resolution was introduced and approved by the
frequently plodding Security Council in just over 24 hours, a pace
that reflects the United States' wide support as it leads a global
campaign to pursue those responsible for the attacks, and any nation
that harbors them.</P>
      <P>Under the resolution, all countries must make the "willful"
financing of terrorism a criminal offense, immediately freeze
terrorist-related funds and prevent movement of individuals and
groups suspected of having terrorist connections. All member nations
must deny terrorists any "safe haven."</P>
      <P>Additionally, nations must speed the exchange of "operational
information," especially regarding the actions and movements of
terrorists.</P>
      <P>While the resolution stops short of threatening sanctions against
countries that fail to abide by the anti-terrorism measures, it does
express the UNSC's determination "to take all necessary steps to
ensure the full implementation."</P>
      <P>To ensure that all member countries adopt the strongly worded
measure, the UNSC even has created a committee to monitor their
efforts.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER SAYS ROC WILL NOT BE ABSENT FROM APEC INFORMAL SUMMIT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  3  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung said Wednesday
that the Republic of China will not be absent from the informal
leaders' summit of the Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation forum
slated for Oct. 20-21 in Shanghai.</P>
      <P>Premier Chang stressed that President Chen Shui-bian still hopes
to attend the summit, but added that if he is unable to, the
government will in the near future decide who will represent him.</P>
      <P>The premier stressed that Taiwan "will by no means" be absent
from the APEC informal leader's summit and that the government is
still making efforts to have President Chen represent the ROC at the
summit, adding that even if its efforts at having the president fail
this year, it will try again next year.</P>
      <P>President Chen has been adamant about participating in the APEC
summit in person this year. In previous years, the president has
always been represented by an appointed proxy because of Beijing's
insistence. This is the first time that an APEC summit is being held
in mainland China.</P>
      <P>In the past, the host country had always sent a special envoy to
Taipei to present a formal invitation to the ROC president to attend
the summit, but this year, Beijing only faxed a brief notice of the
summit meeting to Taiwan in May.</P>
      <P>The notice did not include the name of the intended recipient and
only asked Taipei's senior APEC official to forward the message to
concerned bodies.</P>
      <P>APEC is one of the few international organizations that
simultaneously admits Taiwan and mainland China. A regional forum
dedicated to promoting free trade and investment, its members include
Australia, Brunei, Canada, mainland China, Chile, Hong Kong,
Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua
New Guinea, Peru, the Philippine, Russia, Singapore, Taiwan,
Thailand, the United States and Vietnam.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC DECIDES TO PURCHASE KIDD-CLASS WARSHIPS: DEFENSE MINISTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  3 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China Ministry of National
Defense (MND) has approved the navy's plan to purchase the four
Kidd-class destroyers that the United States offered to sell to
Taiwan in April, Defense Minister Wu Shih-wen confirmed Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Wu said that after a thorough assessment by the ROC navy, which
found that the destroyers could meet its combat needs, the MND
decided to endorse the purchase of the four Kidd-class destroyers
from the United States.</P>
      <P>Fielding questions at the Legislative Yuan, Wu said the budget
for the procurement was not listed in the 2002 Annual Budget Bill,
but the funds needed, roughly between NT$25-27 billion (US$725-783
million), are expected to be allocated on a yearly basis beginning in
2003.</P>
      <P>ROC ports, including those in Keelung, Kaohsiung and Makung,
could all be considered appropriate ports to accommodate the
Kidd-class destroyers, which are known for their large size.</P>
      <P>However, Wu pointed out, the ports' designation as locations to
house the 9,000-ton warships does not necessarily mean that the
Kidd-class destroyers will in the end be stationed at these ports.</P>
      <P>It was learned that ROC navy authorities vigorously debated the
procurement issue before a decision to purchase the destroyers was
arrived at as there were evident differences of opinion among the
officers on the issue.</P>
      <P>The four Kidd-class destroyers were part of a robust arms sales
package to Taiwan worth more than US$4 billion that U.S. President
George W. Bush approved in April. The package was the largest
approved since 1992 when the U.S. government agreed to sell the
island 150 F-16 jet fighters.</P>
      <P>The United States deferred a decision on the sale of four Arleigh
Burke-class destroyers equipped with the state-of-the-art Aegis radar
system, instead deciding to offer Taiwan four Kidd-class destroyers,
a dozen anti-submarine P-3 "Orion" aircraft, and eight diesel
submarines.</P>
      <P>Democratic Progressive Party Legislator Tsai Ming-hsien in late
April called for the government agencies concerned to reconsider the
offer before making a decision. He said the Kidd-class destroyers
were built 20 years ago and have a displacement of 9,000 metric tons,
making them easy targets in the event of a mainland Chinese military
attack.</P>
      <P>According to ROC navy sources, the Kidd-class destroyers, which
are currently mothballed, will be ready for delivery by 2003. The
destroyers are equipped with radar systems that have an effective
range of 350 kilometers and can simultaneously fire four
anti-aircraft missiles with a range of 70 kilometers.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BANKS MUST REIMBURSE BOGUS BANK NOTES: PREMIER CHANG</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  3  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung said Wednesday
that local banks must reimburse recipients for counterfeit New Taiwan
dollar bank notes distributed either by their clerks or automatic
teller machines.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a weekly Cabinet meeting, Chang said he has made the
decision with a view to enhancing banks' obligation to help prevent
the circulation of fake bills.</P>
      <P>In his view, Chang said, domestic financial institutions should
assume the greatest share of responsibility for curbing the
circulation of bogus bank notes.</P>
      <P>"So long as individual holders can prove that their fake bank
notes have been received from banks or affiliated automatic teller
machines, the distributing banks must reimburse them for their
losses," Chang said.</P>
      <P>Noting that the circulating of bogus bank notes would affect
local people's confidence in holding cash and would even perhaps
disrupt the domestic financial order, Chang said law enforcement
authorities should step up intelligence gathering to determine who is
making counterfeit bank notes.</P>
      <P>Chang ordered the Ministry of Justice (MOJ) to form a special
task force to investigate whether there is any criminal ring involved
in the counterfeiting.</P>
      <P>The premier said the MOJ should invite officials from the
Judicial Yuan, the National Police Administration, the Ministry of
Justice Investigation Bureau (MJIB) and other relevant agencies to
form the special investigative team.</P>
      <P>Chang also directed the Central Bank of China (CBC) to launch a
publicity campaign to help local residents be able to tell fake notes
from the real thing.</P>
      <P>"As new versions of the various denominations of bank notes
contain 12 visible anti-counterfeiting marks and designs and two
machine-readable anti-counterfeiting devices, it would not be
difficult to detect bogus bills," the premier said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the CBC invited senior executives of 56 local
financial institutions to a meeting Wednesday to discuss feasible
measures to stamp out the circulation of fake bills.</P>
      <P>CBC Deputy Governor Chen Shih-meng said domestic banks must
assume full responsibility for sorting out bogus bank notes. "Each
bank's performance in this field will become one of the major items
to be subject to the CBC's regular financial inspections," Chen
added.</P>
      <P>A local firm displayed two specially designed sorting machines at
the conference site to lobby bankers to purchase the machines to help
detect all counterfeit bills. CBC officials said local banks are free
to decide whether to install such machines.</P>
      <P>Statistics compiled by major financial institutions show that the
average number of seized bogus bank notes totals about 1,000 per
month, with the new versions of the NT$1,000 and NT$500 denominations
being the most common.</P>
      <P>Compared with previous recorded levels of fake notes in
circulation, the figure does not represent a marked increase. Law
enforcement officers said the impression that the use of bogus bank
notes has become more rampant since the circulation of new versions
Taiwan bank notes began late last year might result from the fact
that fake notes have mostly been used in dimly-lit traditional food
markets and betel nut vending booths.</P>
      <P>CBC Governor Perng Fai-nan visited a traditional food market in
Taipei Sunday to publicize the ways of identifying genuine bank
notes. Perng's unusual move followed a complaint by Taipei City
Councilor Pang Chien-kuo who said food vendors in the city's Huannan
market alone are passed an average of NT$1.35 million worth of fake
bills per month.</P>
      <P>Under current Taiwan laws, there is a maximum sentence of life
imprisonment for people found illegally printing bank notes, while
those who knowingly use counterfeit money can receive a prison
sentence of up to three years.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Transportation and Communications Minister
Yeh Chu-lan said Wednesday that many international airlines have
begun to staff security personnel on their planes since the recent
terror attacks in the United States and that she approves of the
practice.</P>
      <P>Yeh made the remarks while fielding questions at the Legislative
Yuan concerning safety on passenger flights in the wake of the Sept.
11 terrorist attacks in New York City and Washington, D.C.</P>
      <P>Legislator Chen Ching-pao, noting that Taiwan has also been
deemed a possible target for terrorists since the Sept. 11 attacks,
asked whether the time has come for the reinstating of the practice
of staffing security personnel on airplanes that Taiwan airlines used
to carry out but have recently abandoned.</P>
      <P>Yeh noted she is in favor of the practice, but added that Taiwan
airlines will have to evaluate the situation themselves and that
there are no laws on the books requiring onboard security staff.</P>
      <P>The Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) also said that China
Airlines reinstated the practice Oct. 1 on its international routes
after it had abandoned it a few years ago. EVA Airways, another major
domestic airline, is also mulling over whether to staff security
personnel on its planes.</P>
      <P>The CAA said that onboard security personnel are allowed to carry
all the necessary security equipment but are not be equipped with
guns.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Hu Cheng-pu, director of the General Staff for
Operations under the Ministry of National Defense (MND), said in
response to a legislator's question that in a situation where a
civilian plane were threatening the safety of the general public on
the ground, he would recommend that it be shot down.</P>
      <P>He said that if aviation authorities alerted the MND to the fact
that a passenger plane had been hijacked and had veered from its
regular flight path, the MND would shoot it down out of humanitarian
considerations to limit the number of casualties in such a tragedy.</P>

    <HEADLINE>COA DETAILS PLANS TO DEVELOP AGRICULTURAL BIO-SCIENTIFIC TECHNOLOGY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 3 (CNA)
(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council of Agriculture (COA) will spend
some NT$1.6 billion over the next three years to finance projects for
improvement of Taiwan's competitiveness in agricultural
bio-scientific technology.</P>
      <P>Lee Jen-chyuan, vice chairman of the COA, made the statement at a
plenary session of the Committee on Science, Technology and
Information under the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>He told legislators that the COA has singled out seedling
research, marine cultivation and flower-growing as important
strategic sectors in the development of the fields of agriculture,
fishery and livestock.</P>
      <P>In order to improve the competitiveness of the island's
agricultural bio-scientific technology, Lee said that the COA will
pour about NT$520 million into relevant projects in fiscal 2002 and
added that the total investment in the coming three years will total
NT$1.6 billion.</P>
      <P>Regarding the proposal of the recently-held Economic Development
Advisory Conference that the COA establish agricultural cultivation
centers within six months to one year, Lee said that three such
centers will be set up.</P>
      <P>He said that the academic resources from National Taiwan
University will be used for the operation of the Taipei cultivation
center, with the resources from National Chunghsing University being
allocated for the operation of the Taichung cultivation center.</P>
      <P>The cultivation center to be established in southern Taiwan is
still in the planning phase, he said.</P>
      <P>The Economic Development Advisory Conference, convened under the
directive of President Chen Shui-bian, also proposed the
establishment of high-technology agricultural bio-technology parks.</P>
      <P>Lee said that the COA has been working out the blueprints for
establishing four such parks in northern, central, southern and
eastern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He said that the experience gained in establishing the existing
industrial zones by the National Science Council and the Ministry of
Economic Affairs will be borrowed for the establishment of the
agricultural bio-technology parks.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's entry into the World Trade Organization, expected by
next January, will greatly affect the development of the island's
agricultural sector. The projects being undertaken by the COA are
among the steps designed to minimize the possible impact.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ECONOMICS MINISTER SAYS NO OIL HIKE ANYTIME BEFORE END OF YEAR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  3  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Economic Affairs Lin Hsin-yi
said Wednesday that the state-owned Chinese Petroleum Corp. (CPC) has
a 110-day safety reserve of crude oil and that there will be no
domestic oil price hike anytime before the end of this year.</P>
      <P>Lin made the remarks while reporting at the Legislative Yuan,
during which time several legislators expressed their concerns about
the impact on Taiwan's economy if the United States were to launch a
military attack on Afghanistan.</P>
      <P>Lin said that if the United States does launch an attack on
Afghanistan for harboring Osama bin Laden, the prime suspect behind
the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, then the major impact would be on
Taiwan's petroleum prices and on its high-tech product exports.</P>
      <P>He said a U.S. military action would delay the recovery of the
global economy and cause world oil prices to fluctuate.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that it was generally expected that the sluggish
U.S. economy would rebound in the fourth quarter this year, Lin said
that because of the terrorist attacks, some believe the recovery will
have to wait until the first or second quarters of next year, or even
until the second half of next year.</P>
      <P>He said that a U.S. military action would cause the consumer
confidence index to dip again, directly affecting Taiwan's high-tech
product exports and shipping.</P>
      <P>On possible petroleum price increases, Lin said the CPC still has
a 110-day safety reserve of crude oil, including stored crude and
that which is being delivered, pointing out that this, along with the
fact that Formosa Plastics also has reserves of crude oil means
petroleum prices in Taiwan will not be adjusted upward anytime before
the end of the year.</P>
      <P>Lin said that if a U.S. military attack were to be carried out
quickly, Taiwan's economic recovery would be delayed for one or two
quarters, adding that if a U.S. military action were to turn into a
prolonged war, the period for Taiwan's economic recovery would also
be lengthened.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EX-PRESIDENT LEE STILL HAS CLOUT IN YEAR-END ELECTIONS: POLL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  3  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A majority of local people think that
former President Lee Teng-hui would still enjoy a clout in the
upcoming elections for local government chiefs and legislators,
according to the results of an opinion poll released Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The telephone poll of 1,068 randomly chosen adult residents,
conducted by the Great Era Culture Foundation from Sept. 25-28,
found that 60.4 percent of the respondents thought that even though
the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) has already revoked Lee's party
membership, he would still be able to influence the outcome of the
Dec. 1 elections for legislators, city mayors and county magistrates.</P>
      <P>Survey results further showed that 61.63 percent threw
support behind the KMT's decision to oust Lee who concurrently led
the party during his 12-year stint as the Republic of China's head
of state.</P>
      <P>Asked about Lee's legacies to the KMT, 34.02 percent said they
thought that Lee had done "more merits than faults" to the party
during his service as KMT chairman; 28.58 percent said they thought
otherwise; 20.71 percent said they thought that Lee's merits were
offset by his faults; and 16.68 percent said they had no opinion
about the issue.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 52.53 percent said they agreed with certain ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) officials' remarks that Lee's
stumping for candidates of the newly formed opposition Taiwan
Solidarity Union (TSU) would adversely affect their DPP
counterparts' chances of victory in the legislative elections. In
contrast, 32.87 percent said they don't think so.</P>
      <P>In the wake of Lee's ouster from the KMT, 69.38 percent said they
believe that the year-end elections would be a race between the
"pan-blue" camp and the "pan-green" camp, while 22.38 percent said
they see no signs that such a scenario would appear.</P>
      <P>The "pan-blue" camp refers to the KMT and its two splinter
groups -- the People First Party and the New Party, while the
"pan-green" camp refers to the DPP and the TSU. The "pan-blue" camp
is widely believed to favor eventual unification of the two sides of
the Taiwan Strait, and the "pan-green" camp prefers to keep Taiwan
separate from mainland China.</P>
      <P>The KMT-affiliated Great Era Culture Foundation also conducted
an opinion survey from Sept.14-16 to explore public views on certain
"pan-blue" camp-related issues.</P>
      <P>The results of the telephone poll of 1,069 adults showed that
41.72 percent of the respondents thought that the pan-blue camp
candidate for the Taipei county magistrate election, Wang
Chien-shien, would be the winner, while 39.94 percent said they
believe that incumbent Magistrate Su Chen-chang, a DPP stalwart,
would be able to win his re-election bid.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EPA HOPING TO RESTRICT USE OF POLYETHYLENE PLASTIC BAGS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  3 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government of the Republic of China is
hoping to restrict the use of the ubiquitous polyethylene (PE) bags
used around the island to better protect the environment, an official
with the Cabinet-level Environmental Protection Administration (EPA)
said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Although recycling has gradually taken root in Taiwan, residents
are still using too many plastic bags, said Lu Hung-kuang, director
of the EPA's Solid Waste Control Bureau.</P>
      <P>Taiwan consumers use excessive numbers of PE bags mainly because
they are not in the habit of bringing their own shopping bags when
they shop, Lu said.</P>
      <P>Excessive use of the plastic bags is increasing the risk of
health dangers, Lu said, adding that polyethylene does not decompose
for many years, while burning it creates dioxin pollution, a serious
toxin.</P>
      <P>Lu said that a draft proposed by the EPA to restrict the use of
PE bags has passed its first reading at the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>If the legislature passes the bill by the end of its current
session at the end of October, it will pave the way for more serious
restrictions on the use of the plastic bags, Lu said.</P>
      <P>The bill stipulates restrictions on PE bag use in three stages:
Public-run organizations, including government offices, schools and
the military, will take the initiative to begin to stop using PE bags
from May next year, to be followed by discount store chains,
department stores, supermarkets, convenience stores and fast-food
chains six months later, and then followed by laundries, bakeries and
ordinary shops one year later, according to Lu.</P>
      <P>Traditional markets will not be included in the three-stage
implementation of the restrictions, Lu said.</P>
      <P>Violators of the restrictions could face fines ranging from
NT$60,000 to NT$300,000, he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GOV'T TO APPLY ECO-ENGINEERING METHODS TO TACKLE MUDSLIDE PROBLEM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  3 (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The high death toll and devastation caused
by mudslides triggered by recent torrential rains have awakened the
public awareness of ecological preservation, and an
inter-governmental Cabinet-level task force has decided to apply
"ecological engineering methods" to tackle the problem from its
origin.</P>
      <P>Mudslides and floods have become the most ruthless killers in
Taiwan since the island was hit by the deadly earthquake of Sept. 21,
1999. Mountainous areas jolted by the earthquake were made vulnerable
to heavy rainfall, and short and steep rivers and steams very often
turned into torrents carrying rocks and silt.</P>
      <P>An official of the Public Construction Commission under the
Cabinet said Wednesday that the task force would try to find remedies
for the ecological damage caused by excessive exploitation of natural
resources.</P>
      <P>The task force was organized jointly by the Council of
Agriculture, Ministry of the Interior, Ministry of Economic Affairs
and the Ministry of Transportation and Communications.</P>
      <P>Kuo Ching-chiang, deputy director of the commission, said that
integrated efforts were needed to deal with the mudslide problem.
While excessive exploitation of natural resources has been proven to
be a factor worsening the damage done by natural disasters, the task
force planned to apply ecological engineering methods to solve the
problem and to rehabilitate the environment, he added.</P>
      <P>Kuo said that in the past, the mudslide problem was most often
handled by constructing docks and banks to blockade slides. The
commission in recent months has applied new methods by taking into
consideration the natural environment in the mudslide prevention
projects in 28 sites around the island.</P>
      <P>For densely populated Taiwan, the new methods emphasizing
stability and sustainable ecosystems and harmony between the natural
environment and human society are fundamental solutions to its
ecological and environmental problems, according to the official.</P>
      <P>The concept of ecological engineering is not new in Taiwan,
though the ecological environment has very often fallen victim to
construction projects. The Water Resources Bureau under the Ministry
of Economic Affairs has cooperated with National Taipei University of
Technology and the University of Virginia in the United States to set
up the Water Environment Research Center. The center has made
ecological engineering methods a major research subject.</P>

      <P>Farmers in central Taiwan are getting help
from the government to learn how to promote their produce on the
Internet.</P>
      <P>The Commerce Department of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and
the Department of Machinery Engineering of the Industrial Technology
Research Institute (ITRI) are helping farmers in central Taiwan to
promote sales of their farm produce via the Internet.</P>
      <P>921.mtec.com.tw is a Web site featuring fruits, vegetables, rice

central Taiwan. The Web site is cooperating with employee-owned,
in-house shops of big companies in the Hsinchu Science-based
Industrial Park to sell farm products. Consumers can place online
orders and pick up the deliveries from these in-house shops.</P>
      <P>The agricultural sector in central Taiwan has not fully recovered
from the damage of the earthquake of Sept. 21, 1999. While helping
the farmers rebuild their homes and businesses, the government has

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  3 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Wednesday he
hopes that more local people would join volunteer services to help
boost the Republic of China's relations with countries around the
world.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks while reviewing 19 local volunteers who
will soon depart for working in countries that maintain formal
diplomatic ties with the ROC.</P>
      <P>Also present at the occasion were 37 selected conscripts who
will work with the ROC's overseas technical missions for the next
two years as alternative to their mandatory military services.</P>
      <P>Quoting tallies compiled by the United Nations, Chen said more
than 25 percent of citizens of advanced democratic countries
have experiences of working as volunteers.</P>
      <P>For instance, 56 percent of Americans had once worked as
volunteers. The ratios in Germany and Japan were 34 percent and 26
percent, respectively.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, Chen said he is convinced that there is
still ample room for Taiwan's volunteer work force to grow. "I'm
hopeful that our volunteer work force will expand gradually in
the years to come," he added.</P>
      <P>In addition to helping promote domestic community development,
Chen said, Taiwan volunteers can also work for international
cooperative programs and help boost bilateral and
multilateral cultural exchanges.</P>
      <P>The ROC began to send volunteers five years ago to work for its
diplomatic allies or developing countries friendly to Taiwan. And
this year, it decided to send young conscripts to work at its
overseas technical missions as alternative military services. The
first batch of young conscripts will work at the ROC's 25
technical missions in 21 countries in Africa, Latin America and
Asia. They will depart to assume overseas missions in early November.

      <P>Sales of digital cameras in Taiwan are

industry sources said.</P>
      <P>Although autumn is usually the peak season for the sales of

      <P>The sources estimated that around 80,000 units will be sold for

40,000 and 50,000 units. They also forecast that the growth rate in
sales for this year will be around 40 percent, down from the 2000
growth level of 60 percent.</P>
      <P>Middle-range and top-of-the-line models are the most popular

    <HEADLINE>ROC PREMIER SAYS STABLE TAIPEI-BEIJING RELATIONS IS GOV'T POLICY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taoyuan  County,  northern  Taiwan,  Oct.  3  (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Chang
Chun-hsiung said Wednesday at a seminar with the heads of Taiwanese
business associations located in mainland China that stable
Taipei-Beijing relations is the government's consistent policy.</P>
      <P>Chang told the approximately 130 participants of the two-day
seminar being held in northern Taiwan's Taoyuan County that "no
dispute cannot be resolved" as long as there exists domestic
consensus and sincerity.</P>
      <P>The most difficult part of formulating a mainland China policy
for the government is to find a domestic consensus, he said.</P>
      <P>However, Chang continued, the Economic Development Advisory
Conference held in August managed to consolidate a certain degree of
consensus among the ruling and opposition parties as well as other
sectors, and the government will be able to carry out its mainland
policies based on these agreements.</P>
      <P>At the same seminar, Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) Chairman
Koo Chen-fu, who has long served as Taiwan's top negotiator with
mainland China, said that of the 36 consensuses reached at the
advisory conference in August on the issue of cross-strait relations,
the essence can be said to be the principles of "Taiwan first, global
positioning, reciprocal benefits leading to win-win situations, and
risk management."</P>
      <P>Koo went on to say that the government's decision to replace its
"no haste, be patient" policy on Taiwanese investments in the
mainland by an "active opening, effective management" policy
represents the good will of the government and its willingness to
cooperate in developing normalized relations between Taipei and
Beijing.</P>
      <P>Koo said that the various problems created in increasingly
frequent cross-strait exchanges -- particularly those related to
protecting the investment rights of Taiwanese businesspeople in the
mainland -- require the urgent resumption of dialogue and bilateral
negotiations to resolve.</P>
      <P>However, he added that a "win-win" cross-strait relationship that
is reciprocal cannot be achieved overnight, and that the Taiwanese
businesspeople in mainland China can do their part to help people on
the mainland understand Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The SEF is a quasi-official intermediary body empowered by the
government to handle relations with mainland China in the absence of
official ties. It routinely organizes seminars for Taiwanese
businespeople investing in the mainland together with the
Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council.</P>

      <P>Chang Siao-yue, spokeswoman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,

ties and that their relations will not be affected by a change of
political power.</P>
      <P>As to the foreign wire reports saying that Taiwan may cut its
official ties with Nicaragua if the leftist Sandinistas win power in
November, Chang described it as "unfounded."</P>
      <P>Some foreign wire reports dispatched from Nicaragua quoted recent
observations by Sandinista vice presidential candidate Agustin
Jarquin as saying that once its party wins the election in November,
it will "respect" its diplomatic ties with the ROC and promote
Taiwan's investments in Nicaragua, while seeking resumption of strong
ties with mainland China.</P>
      <P>Jarquin also was quoted as saying that the Sandinistas will allow
Beijing to set up a trade office in Managua.</P>
      <P>Taiwan cut diplomatic ties with Nicaragua when the Sandinistas

      <P>The Board of Foreign Trade (BOFT) said
Wednesday that it, in cooperation with the Taiwan Steel &amp; Iron
Industries Association, will study how to cope with dumping
allegations from the United States on Taiwan's cold-rolled carbon
steel products.</P>
      <P>The anti-dumping charge will be the second of its kind against
Asian steel makers recently, and the BOFT said it will closely
monitor subsequent developments.</P>
      <P>The U.S. steel industry accused Asian makers of cold-rolled
carbon steel products of selling their goods under fair market
prices in the U.S. as a means to resolve their problems of
overstocking and sluggish demand back at home.</P>
      <P>Nine Taiwan-based steel makers, including state-run China Steel
Corp., Ornatube Enterprise and Kao Hsing Chang Iron &amp; Steel are named

Turkey, France, Germany, India, Japan, South Korea, Holland, New

      <P>Taiwan exported more than 40,000 metric tons of cold-rolled
carbon steel products between June 2000 and June 2001, worth US$13.94
million, U.S. government tallies show. The export amount for June
this year alone was 1.7 times that of the same month a year ago.</P>

      <P>The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) adopted a
seven-point platform for its candidates running in the year-end
legislative elections at a routine Central Standing Committee meeting
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The KMT's platform is based on a commitment to "reject

    <HEADLINE>NO VICIOUS REMARKS WILL BE USED TOWARD EX-CHAIRMAN: KMT SPOKESMAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  3  (CNA)
(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Kuomintang (KMT) spokesman Wang Chih-kang
said Wednesday that the party will not use "vicious remarks" against
former party chairman Lee Teng-hui, who was stripped of his party
membership recently.</P>
      <P>Wang said that the issue about Lee's attacks on the KMT and KMT
leaders was raised at the day's Central Standing Committee meeting.</P>
      <P>He said that the basic principle of the party is not to direct
vicious remarks against Lee, but pointed out that the KMT will employ
a very clear and powerful method to correct any misunderstanding or
distortion regarding the party.</P>
      <P>During his recent tour stumping for candidates of the newly
established Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) in southern Taiwan, Lee
attacked the KMT for taking a policy designed to "join hands with the
communists against the interest of Taiwan."</P>
      <P>He also criticized KMT Chairman Lien Chan, who replaced Lee as
chairman in March last year, and Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou, a member
of the KMT Central Standing Committee.</P>
      <P>Wang contended that the KMT's policy toward mainland China is
based on the National Unification Guidelines and therefore "will
absolutely not sacrifice the interests of the people of Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, KMT Vice Chairman Wu Po-hsiung said that he had
already stated that there is no need to make vicious remarks against
any third party, and added that everyone should have a positive
attitude when joining or departing from a group.</P>
      <P>Wu, who had served as KMT secretary-general and presidential
secretary-general when Lee was KMT chairman and the ROC president,
admitted that he felt a bit strange about the way Lee spoke before
and the way he has spoken recently.</P>
      <P>He said that the memory of the people will not deteriorate
and they have the ability to judge for themselves.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FOREIGN LABOR WAGES TO UNDERGO FURTHER CUTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  3  (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's top labor affairs official said
Wednesday that the Council for Labor Affairs (CLA) is planning
further cuts to foreign labor wages and that the workers will in
effect receive the same amount of pay after brokerage fees are
lowered in tandem.</P>
      <P>CLA Chairwoman Chen Chu said while reporting to the Legislative
Yuan's health, environment and social welfare committee that her
council will put forward its latest foreign labor policy within two
weeks to carry out the conclusions of the Economic Development
Advisory Conference held in August.</P>
      <P>As part of its new policy, she continued, the CLA plans to deduct
NT$4,000 (US$116) to NT$6,000 (US$174) in "room and board fees" from
the workers' monthly wages -- an increase in deduction from the
previous NT$2,500 (US$72) to NT$4,000 only recently put in place.</P>
      <P>The deductions, which Chen said would be determined by factors
like the cost of living in different areas across the island, would
add up to NT$48,000 (US$1,389) to NT$72,000 (US$2,083) per year.</P>
      <P>To compensate for the lower income, brokerage fees that foreign
laborers usually pay in advance for the chance to work in Taiwan will
be slashed at the same time to protect the rights of the foreign
workers, she added.</P>
      <P>The minimum wage in Taiwan is NT$15,840 (US$458) per month --
higher than what foreign laborers could earn elsewhere, such as in
Hong Kong or Singapore.</P>
      <P>Foreign laborers often take out high-interest loans to pay for
brokerage fees and have to work one to two years before being able to
pay off the debt.</P>
      <P>Under the new deduction scheme, businesses hiring the
approximately 210,000 foreign workers nationwide will save a total of
over NT$10 billion (US$289 million).</P>
      <P>Chen said that the countries that have been exporting laborers to
Taiwan have been allowing labor brokers in their countries to charge
exorbitant brokerage fees for the past 10 years.</P>
      <P>She added that the CLA will not allow such "unreasonable"
practices in the future.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN CUTS DISCOUNT RATE, DEPOSIT RESERVE RATIOS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  3  (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's central bank announced Wednesday
that it will cut the discount rate by 0.25 percentage point to 2.50
percent starting from Thursday, following a move by the U.S. Federal
Reserve Tuesday to cut its key interest rate by a half point.</P>
      <P>It will be the 10th cut in the discount rate by the Central Bank
of China (CBC) since December of last year.</P>
      <P>The CBC will also cut the accommodations with collateral and
accommodations without collateral rates by 0.25 percentage
points each, to 2.875 and 4.75 percent, respectively.</P>
      <P>At the same time, the bank will also cut the average deposit
reserve requirement for banks from 6.22 percent to 5.00 percent, and
the reserve requirement on foreign currency deposits from 10 percent
to 5 percent.</P>
      <P>Asked about whether the CBC's 10th rate cut can reach its goal to
stimulate the economy, Chrystal Shih, director-general of the CBC's
Economic Research Department, said it will take time to see the
fruits of the interest rate cut.</P>
      <P>However, Shih added, the cut in reserve requirement on deposits
is aimed at lowering banks' capital and operational costs, which is
expected to help increase local banks' competitiveness once Taiwan
joins the World Trade Organization.</P>
      <P>The CBC urged local banks to realistically reflect the lowered
capital costs of their banks, and to cut basic loan rates in order to
spur economic activities and stimulate consumption and investment.</P>
      <P>K. C. Lee, vice chairman of the Cabinet-level Council for
Economic Planning and Development (CEPD), said that considering the
relatively stable consumer prices in Taiwan, and that its real
interest rate is not low, there is still room for further interest
rate cuts in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Concerning the doubts expressed by many economists whether the
frequent interest rate cuts can spur the economy, Lee said the fact
that central banks around the world announced simultaneous interest
rate cuts after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in United States means
this policy is still necessary at a time when the world is mired in
an economic downturn.</P>

(By David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan could form a
strategic partnership with Japan to make further inroads into the
mainland Chinese market, said Minister of Economic Affairs Lin
Hsin-yi Wednesday at a two-day seminar on cross-strait business
strategies.</P>
      <P>The meeting was held in Tahsi, Taoyuan with some 100 Taiwan
businessmen operating in mainland China attending.</P>
      <P>Lin said that although Taiwan's competitiveness is keen among the
world economies, the island must formulate its own discreet strategy
for prospering in the globalized economy.</P>
      <P>After both sides of the Taiwan Strait gain admission into the
World Trade Organization, the cross-strait relationship will be
either a competitive or a cooperative one, he said. Therefore, Lin
said, if Taiwan cannot work out its own competitive strategy, it will
lose its edge to mainland China.</P>
      <P>Yang Wan-chin, deputy secretary-general of the Straits Exchange
Foundation, Taiwan's quasi-official organization for affairs relating
to mainland China in the absence of official ties, said Taiwan and

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER SAYS DEMOCRACY IN TAIWAN BECOMING MATURE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 3 (CNA)
(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Premier Chang Chun-hsiung
said Wednesday that democracy in Taiwan is maturing more than one
year after the inauguration of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
administration.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks while speaking at the joint opening ceremony
of a study class on national development and research and a study
class on the development and research of women's leadership.</P>
      <P>Both classes are organized by the Executive Yuan.</P>
      <P>Chang said that in the past, Taiwan lacked the history and
culture of cooperation between the ruling and opposition parties, a
reason why many disputes arose after the DPP's Chen Shui-bian took
over the presidency in May 2000.</P>
      <P>However, he noted that after over 300 recommendations were
reached through consensus at the Economic Development Advisory
Conference recently, he felt that the ruling and opposition parties
have been able to work together and respect each other.</P>
      <P>Chang said that it indicated that the pain caused by the
transition of power has gone, and that democracy is maturing.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan has been affected by the global economic
downturn, he said that the "prospects for economic development remain
very optimistic" if Taiwan is able to endure the current
difficulties.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the president was invited to speak at the joint
opening ceremony and presented his views on the development of a
knowledge-based economy, leadership with far-sighted concepts, and
the national development strategy for pursuit of the welfare of the
people.</P>
      <P>The president said that the success of the implementation of a
national development policy depends not only on the government's
efforts, but also the vitality of the private sector.</P>
      <P>He urged those from academia, the government and industry to put
their efforts together to create a better environment for
development.</P>
      <P>Chen also said that government leaders should possess a global
point of view, strive for a competitive advantage in science and
technology, promote partnership relationships, appreciate different
cultures and cultivate outstanding personnel.</P>

      <P>"We are not changing any of the principled policies that we have

    <HEADLINE>CBC CUTS KEY RATES TO RECORD LOWS TO STIMULATE ECONOMY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 4 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's Central Bank of China (CBC) has cut
key rates to record lows in an effort to rejuvenate the domestic
economy, with the cuts being effective as of Thursday.</P>
      <P>The CBC cut the discount rate by 0.25 percentage points to 2.50
percent, the 10th cut of its kind since December of last year.</P>
      <P>The bank also slashed the accommodations with collateral and
accommodations without collateral rates each by 0.25 percentage
points to 2.875 percent and 4.75 percent, respectively.</P>
      <P>At the same time, the CBC cut the average deposit reserve
requirement for banks from 6.22 percent to 5.0 percent, and slashed
the reserve requirement on foreign currency deposits from 10 percent
to 5 percent.</P>
      <P>The interest rate cuts, the largest since February 1999, promise
to lead about NT$194.6 billion (US$5.64 billion) to be released onto
the domestic capital market, helping to spur economic activity, CBC
officials said.</P>
      <P>By offering the prominent rates cuts, the CBC aims to lower
domestic banks' capital and operational costs, which is expected to
help increase the banks' competitiveness once Taiwan joins the World
Trade Organization.</P>
      <P>The CBC urged domestic banks to reflect the lowered capital costs
by cutting basic loan rates in order to spur economic activity and
stimulate consumption and investment.</P>
      <P>Cheered by the quarter-point cut in local interest rates,
Taiwan's stock market, particularly banking stocks, gained momentum
Thursday, celebrating lowered capital costs with reduced reserve
requirements for banks.</P>
      <P>Thursday's across-the-board rate cuts were also partly made
because of Tuesday's half-point interest rate cut by the U.S. Federal
Reserve, its ninth cut this year.</P>
      <P>In response to the CBC rate cuts, major domestic banks said
Thursday that interest rates at their banks will be cut by an average
of 0.25 percent beginning next week.</P>
      <P>As a result, officials of the banks said, the rate of one-year
time savings may be maintained at 3 percent, or lower.</P>

    <HEADLINE>POWELL STATEMENT INDICATES GREAT FRIENDSHIP TO TAIWAN: SPOKESMAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  4 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China government spokesman
expressed welcome Thursday for U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell's
latest remarks that the United States will not make deals against
Taiwan's interests, describing it as "a very friendly statement"
toward Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Su Tzeng-ping, director-general of the Government Information
Office, said Powell's remarks have given Taiwan a sense of relief at
a time when Washington and Beijing are stepping up strategic
cooperation in collaborative actions against terrorism, a process
which some observers in Taiwan fear may consequently compromise
Taiwan's interests.</P>
      <P>Powell stressed during a meeting with several foreign news agency
journalists Wednesday that the United States will not make any deals
against the interests of Taiwan or India in order to win support for
the Washington-led global campaign against terrorism.</P>
      <P>Powell noted that Washington will not make any deals to obtain
Beijing's participation in the anti-terrorism coalition and that the
Bush administration is seeking cooperation with Pakistan and India
while striving not to inflame existing tensions between the two
nuclear powers.</P>
      <P>He was quoted as saying that "we are not changing any of the
principled policies we have been following, and I think those nations
that depend on us somewhat for their sense of security should have no
fear that somehow their sense of security has been weakened or will
be weakened -- like Taiwan."</P>
      <P>"There are some things that are immutable. We will always speak
out strongly against human rights abuses. We will speak out about
religious freedom, and we will speak out about terrorist activity,"
Powell said.</P>
      <P>Su noted that Powell's public remarks were so clear that Taiwan
could feel the great friendship from Washington, saying at the same
time that he believes that such open statements carry their own
important meanings and messages.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the spokesman disclosed that the Bush administration
has assured Taiwan, via proper channels over the past several days,
that the United States will not compromise Taiwan's interests during
the process of engaging in cooperation with mainland China against
global terrorism.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ANTI-PIRACY GROUP AND POLICE UNCOVER CD PIRACY OPERATIONS IN S. TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 4 (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Police and an anti-piracy group uncovered a
massive operation in southern Taiwan that was bootlegging millions of
NT dollars' worth of CDs and VCDs, a spokesman for the International
Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) Members' Foundation in
Taiwan said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The IFPI anti-piracy group and police together raided an illegal
music CD and VCD packaging plant in Tainan, southern Taiwan Wednesday
evening and found 100,000 pirated music CDs featuring famous artists
from Taiwan and VCDs of major motion pictures. Police said it was
most likely the largest such operation in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The pirated music CDs and movie VCDs were estimated to have a
market value of NT$40 million.</P>
      <P>Elsewhere, in an early morning police raid at a warehouse in
Taoyuan, northern Taiwan, Thursday, more than 20,000 pirated music
CDs and VCDs were discovered. The street value of the bootlegged
discs was estimated to exceed NT$6 million.</P>
      <P>IFPI Taiwan has filed lawsuits against 11 wholesale distributors
of the pirated products who were arrested by police in the Tainan
raid, according to the spokesman.</P>
      <P>He said that IFPI Taiwan had been collecting information about
the suspects for more than two months. The IFPI group and the police
decided to take action at suspicious sites Wednesday evening.</P>
      <P>IFPI is the organization representing the international recording
industry, with a membership of 1,400 record producers and
distributors in 76 countries.</P>
      <P>Since its establishment in 1986, IFPI Taiwan has coordinated with
police in numerous raids at factories and distribution points of
pirated music CDs around the island and on Penghu.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN SHOULD  BLOCK TERRORIST MONEY LAUNDERING: FORMER U.S. STATESMAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 4 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan should make every possible effort to
prevent its banks from becoming a "safe haven" for money laundering
by terrorists, a retired U.S. diplomat said in Taipei Thursday.</P>
      <P>Harvey Feldman, a former alternate U.S. representative to the
United Nations, made the suggestion in a speech delivered at the
Republic of China's Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Feldman, now a senior fellow in China policy at the
Washington-based Heritage Foundation, said he sees no room for
mainland China to take advantage of the current U.S. anti-terrorism
campaign to sway U.S. policy away from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Quoting U.S. President George W. Bush, Feldman said every country
in the world must decide on its own which side it will take in the
ongoing U.S.-led campaign against global terrorism.</P>
      <P>Feldman further dismissed as "nonsense" speculation that the
United States will bargain away Taiwan's interests in seeking
Beijing's cooperation in its war on terrorism.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that Taiwan's future will neither be determined by
the United States nor by Japan or mainland China. "It will all be up
to the people of Taiwan to set forth the island's destiny," he
stressed.</P>
      <P>As for what Taiwan can do to assist the United States in its
current campaign against terrorism, Feldman said the United States
does not want Taiwan to provide either military bases or troops.</P>
      <P>The most important thing Taiwan can do for the anti-terrorism
campaign is to block terrorist money laundering through its banking
system, Feldman said.</P>
      <P>Touching on Taiwan's current issue of whether to boycott the
annual summit meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)
forum to be held in Shanghai later this month in retaliation for
Beijing's continuous denigration of the ROC's participation in
relevant activities, Feldman said it may occasionally be useful to
enter a fight you know you are not going to win in order to make a
point.</P>
      <P>"But if you do that, you also have to know when it's wise to
decide that you have made the point and withdraw rather than to
continue to press the issue past the point where it has any utility,"
Feldman said.</P>
      <P>Noting that the fact of the matter is that it's useful for Taiwan
to be represented in APEC activities, Feldman said Taiwan should know
when it must make a "graceful withdrawal."</P>
      <P>APEC, a 21-member regional forum dedicated to promoting free
trade and investment, is one of the few multinational organizations
which includes both Taiwan and mainland China.</P>
      <P>Because of mainland China's opposition, the ROC president has
been barred from attending the annual APEC summit in person and
should appoint a proxy.</P>
      <P>In the past, the host country of the APEC summit sent a special
envoy to Taipei to forward a formal invitation to the ROC head of
state. This year's host, mainland China, has so far not sent a formal
invitation to President Chen Shui-bian. It only faxed a notice to
Taipei in May giving the date of the APEC summit. The notice lacked
the title of its targeted recipient. Taipei officials said President
Chen has a legitimate right to attend the APEC summit and that
Beijing's APEC protocol breach is yet another move to denigrate
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Commenting on Beijing's failure to uphold the APEC protocol,
Feldman said if mainland China behaves in an uncivilized way, it
simply makes the point that Taiwan has a civilized government.
"They'll make themselves look foolish. They make themselves look
small," he added.</P>
      <P>Feldman further said APEC is a meeting place where Taiwan
officials can interact on the basis of equality with officials from
other Asian countries. "I believe as countries become accustomed to
dealing with Taiwan on an equal basis, Taiwan gains," he said.</P>
      <P>During his stint as the China desk chief at the U.S. Department
of State, Feldman helped create the American Institute in Taiwan, the
quasi-official U.S. body authorized to handle relations with Taiwan
in the absence of formal diplomatic ties. Feldman was also a
co-author of the Taiwan Relations Act, the U.S. law regulating
substantive ties with the ROC.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN PREPARING FIVE-YEAR TAX HOLIDAY FOR FOREIGN REGIONAL CENTERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  4  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government is working on a bill that
would give a five-year tax holiday to domestic and foreign
enterprises that make Taiwan their regional headquarters, sources
from the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The bill is aimed at spurring domestic and foreign investment and
increasing the profile of foreign businesses in Taiwan and is
expected to be drafted in November for legislative screening, said
Minister of Economic Affairs Lin Hsin-yi.</P>
      <P>Lin said participants at the presidential Economic Development
Advisory Conference held in mid-August suggested that Taiwan emulate
Singapore and solicit foreign investment by offering serious
incentives, including tax reductions and exemptions. Singapore
currently offers a 10-year, tax-free holiday for multinational
corporations that maintain regional business operations centers in
the city-state.</P>
      <P>Lin said corporations involving manufacturing or technological
services are potential beneficiaries of Taiwan's five-year, tax-free
investment incentive.</P>

(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The central and local governments of Taiwan
have been paying too much attention to addressing natural disasters
after they happen while not doing enough prevention work, former Vice
Premier Liu Chao-shiuan said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Liu was invited by the Taipei City Government to head a committee
for the reconstruction and rehabilitation of areas hit by Typhoon
Nari at the committee's first full meeting Thursday morning.</P>
      <P>Liu said that government officials have seldom given priority to
disaster prevention measures in their administrative planning.
Adequate precautionary measures could spare the island tremendous
losses and destruction caused by disasters, he added.</P>
      <P>A trained scientist, Liu said that the National Science Council
adopted a resolution 20 years ago to develop a national disaster
prevention system. However, the project was approved by the
legislature only a few years ago. Global atmospheric changes have
made natural disasters more frequent and previously gathered data
obsolete, he said.</P>
      <P>He also said that people should keep in mind the importance of
ecological sustainability when doing reconstruction work.</P>
      <P>The Taipei City Government has entrusted the committee to develop
a disaster prevention and rescue system. The committee should also
locate problem areas in the city's drainage systems and the mass
transportation system. It should also address water and soil
preservation on hillsides.</P>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou said at the meeting that at least NT$10
billion was needed for post-Typhoon Nari reconstruction projects. The
city government expects specialists of the committee to offer their
expertise to help with rebuilding and to find measures to prevent
future disasters.</P>

      <P>Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian
gave a lunch in honor of 796 outstanding senior teachers, whose
teaching careers have surpassed 40 years, at the Chungshan Building
on Yangmingshan Thursday.</P>
      <P>Before the lunch party, the senior teachers received citations
from Academia Sinica President Lee Yuan-tseh and Minister of
Education Ovid Tzeng. The ceremony was originally scheduled to take
place on Teachers' Day Sept. 28, but was postponed till Thursday
because of Typhoon Lekima.</P>
      <P>President Chen praised the contributions of the teachers to the
country's education, saying that the success of the government's
educational reform relies on the support of the people and the
participation of the teachers.</P>
      <P>He said that the teachers are not only models for the students
and the ones that can be instrumental in the success of students, but
also the key persons in the process of educational reform.</P>
      <P>A message by Premier Chang Chun-hsiung's was read on the
occasion. He expressed thanks to the senior teachers for their long
years of contributing to the cultivation of the younger generation.</P>
      <P>The honored senior teachers are from public and private colleges
and the schools affiliated with the province of Taiwan, Taipei City
and Kaohsiung City.</P>
      <P>Tsai Ying, principal of the Tungyuan Elementary School in

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 4 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Costa Rican President Miguel Angel Rodriguez
telephoned President Chen Shui-bian Thursday to express his concern
about the devastation caused by recent typhoons in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Rodriguez conveyed to President Chen the sympathy and condolences
of the people of Costa Rica for those who were killed in typhoons
that barreled through Taiwan last month.</P>
      <P>Rodriguez said he is convinced that under the leadership of
President Chen, the people of Taiwan will be able to overcome all
difficulties in the wake of the disasters and rebuild their lives
with courage and perseverance.</P>
      <P>"I believe that Taiwan will emerge even stronger from the recent
typhoon devastation just as it did after a 7.3-magnitude earthquake
rattled the island Sept. 21, 1999," Rodriguez said.</P>
      <P>For his part, Chen expressed his heartfelt gratitude for the
concern and support extended by the Costa Rican government and people
at this time of hardship.</P>
      <P>"Our government and people are moved by greetings from you. We
truly appreciate the goodwill and friendship shown by your government
and people," Chen told Rodriguez.</P>
      <P>Because of its special geographic location and environment, Chen
said, Taiwan is hit by earthquakes and typhoons from time to time.
Two typhoons -- Nari and Lekima -- lashed Taiwan with gusty winds and
torrential rains in September, leaving nearly 100 people dead and
missing and causing huge property damage.</P>
      <P>Chen said the people of Taiwan will never be daunted by natural
disasters and would weather all challenges with wisdom, expertise and
experience.</P>
      <P>During their phone talks, Rodriguez also mentioned that the Sept.
11 terrorist attacks in the United States and the lingering economic
gloom in the United States, Japan and major European countries has
affected economic development in both Costa Rica and the Republic of
China.</P>
      <P>Rodriguez said his country will learn from Taiwan's experience in
tackling various adversities and challenges in order to sustain its
economic development.</P>
      <P>In their conversation, Chen said he remembered that the first
congratulatory phone call he received after winning the presidential
election in March 2000 was from Rodriguez.</P>
      <P>Chen further said he has fond memories of his state visit to
Costa Rica last year and his meeting with Rodriguez in El Salvador in

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT CHEN CALLS FOR CROSS-STRAIT DIALOGUE UNDER WTO FRAMEWORK</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Tokyo,  Oct.  4 (CNA)
(By Mike Chang and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian has reaffirmed the
Republic of China's desire to conduct dialogue with mainland China
under the framework of the World Trade Organization (WTO).</P>
      <P>Chen made the reaffirmation in an interview with the Mainichi
Shimbun, a Japanese daily. Chen gave the interview in Taipei
Wednesday, and the Japanese paper published the interview in its
Thursday issue.</P>
      <P>Chen said in the interview that the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait finally won official clearance in September to join the WTO.
"We hope to engage in dialogue and contacts with mainland China under
the WTO framework after both sides formally become members of the
Geneva-based world trade regulatory body early next year," he noted.</P>
      <P>It would be inevitable that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait
conduct talks and engagements after their WTO accession, Chen said,
adding that mainland China should understand that if it continues to
decline dialogue with Taiwan, cross-strait differences can never
be settled.</P>
      <P>"Both of us must shelve our political disputes and sit down to
talk to mend out differences," Chen said, adding that the opening of
direct trade, mail and transportation links, commonly known as
"big three links," could be topics for cross-strait negotiations
under the WTO framework.</P>
      <P>Chen said since he assumed office in May 2000, he has spared no
efforts to maintain peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait.
"I'm convinced that cross-strait relations will improve only
under a stable environment. This is also the basis for upgrading
cross-strait ties," he explained.</P>
      <P>Chen said although Beijing has so far made no response to his
repeated goodwill appeals, he will not be daunted and will never give
up his efforts to seek a breakthrough to the lingering cross-strait
limbo.</P>
      <P>In the interview, Chen also expressed his strong desire to
attend the 2001 summit meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) forum to be held in Shanghai later this month.</P>
      <P>Since the ROC is an APEC member, Chen said, he has a legitimate
right to attend the annual APEC summit in person. Because of
Beijing's opposition, the ROC president has been barred from
attending the APEC summit in person and has to name a proxy to
attend in his stead.</P>
      <P>Touching on relations between Taiwan and the United States, Chen
said the basic U.S. policy toward Taiwan has remained unchanged.
Nevertheless, Chen said substantive ROC-U.S. ties have made
remarkable progress this year. "The increased U.S. arms sales are
U.S. recognition of Taiwan's democratization and would help
upgrade Taiwan's defense capabilities," he added.</P>
      <P>Chen also reaffirmed the ROC's full support for the current
U.S.-led campaign against global terrorism.</P>
      <P>Turning to Taiwan's upcoming legislative elections, Chen said no
party is expected to win more than half of seats in the new
legislature to be elected on Dec. 1.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan's political landscape is expected to show significant
changes after the elections," Chen said, adding that his Democratic
Progressive Party is now endeavoring to become the largest party
in the new legislature.</P>

industry opportunity for Taiwan companies competing internationally.</P>
      <P>However, he continued, various kinds of services, key
applications and compatible platforms must exist before the IA
industry can truly take off.</P>
      <P>IAs must be standardized, and the cost for required key hardware
elements like central processing units, displays and flash memories
must be driven lower through market proliferation in order to conform
with the necessary IA characteristics of being lightweight and
inexpensive, he added.</P>
      <P>Shih said that the ubiquitous cellular phone is only a basic

    <HEADLINE>JUSTICE MINISTER WANTS STIFFER PENALTIES FOR FORGING CURRENCY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  4 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Those convicted of forging Taiwan currency
should face stiffer penalties in the future, Minister of Justice Chen
Ding-nan said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Chen said that although the current law prescribes punishment for
counterfeiting money to be a minimum of five years in prison, many
judges have been handing down sentences of less than five years. The
maximum penalty for currency forgery is death.</P>
      <P>In other words, judges have not meted out sentences in line with
the law, he said, adding that prosecutors' offices are not clear
about exactly what criteria judges have been using to pass judgment
on currency forgery cases.</P>
      <P>A ministry task force on counterfeit bills will meet Friday. They
are expected to invite representatives from the Judicial Yuan to help
with the effort.</P>
      <P>Chen said that in the future, prosecutors will request the
maximum penalty for those who seriously disrupt financial stability
and order by making or passing bogus currency. The ministry is also
considering revising the law to raise the minimum penalty for
counterfeiting currency.</P>
      <P>Under current law, those who have been convicted of intentionally
passing fake bills, but have not themselves forged the notes, should
be sentenced to a minimum of three years and a maximum of 10 years in
prison.</P>
      <P>Addressing Chen's remarks, Yang Jen-shou, secretary-general of
the Judicial Yuan, said that judges mete out sentences based on the
situations surrounding each individual case, and he disagreed that
sentences that have been given by judges have been lower than the
minimum.</P>
      <P>Chen, who is known for his integrity, said that fake bills will
not only disrupt financial order, but will also affect people's
confidence. With the current economic situation being less than
ideal, he believes a stable economic environment is especially
important.</P>
      <P>Chen also urged the public to report fake bill to the police.</P>
      <P>The Central Bank of China (CBC) has recently adopted several
measures to curb the circulation of forged bills, including
requesting local banks to reimburse the recipients for counterfeit
bills distributed by their clerks or automatic teller machines.</P>
      <P>The CBC has also stepped up efforts to teach the public methods
to distinguish real bills from counterfeit ones. The CBC has run
advertisements in newspapers, advising the public to carefully
examine notes that are given them using one or more of the methods of
verification, such as observing if the note bears the concealed
numbers "1000" or "500" when holding the NT$1,000 and NT$500
denomination bills against the light.</P>
      <P>CBC Governor Perng Fai-nan also went out of his way to visit a
traditional food market in Taipei Sunday to publicize the ways of
discerning genuine bank notes.</P>
      <P>Statistics compiled by major financial institutions show that
about 1,000 fake bills are reported each month, with the new versions
of the NT$1,000 and NT$500 denominations being the most common.</P>
      <P>Compared with previous statistics of the numbers of fake notes in
circulation, the figure does not represent a marked increase. But a
sluggish economy may fuel the sense of loss when fake bills are
received, law enforcement officials said.</P>

      <P>A heavyweight of the opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) rebutted as groundless Thursday former Republic of China
president and former KMT chairman Lee Teng-hui's accusation that the
KMT "allies itself with (Chinese) communists against Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Chin Hsiao-yi, chairman of a KMT foundation, made the remark at
an international academic forum on modern China's history. Chin was
former deputy secretary-general of the KMT's Central Committee and
former head of the National Palace Museum.</P>
      <P>Chin said that Lee, who led the ROC government and the KMT for 12
years, is to blame for the current political situation in the ROC and
should conduct a deep self-examination.</P>
      <P>The forum was sponsored by the KMT to celebrate next Wednesday's
90th anniversary of the 1911 revolution that led to the overthrow of
the Ching dynasty and the founding of the ROC.</P>
      <P>Lee harshly criticized the KMT many times after he was forced to
step down as party chairman following the 107-year-old party's
humiliating defeat in the 2000 presidential election.</P>
      <P>He has also been stumping for candidates of the Taiwan Solidarity
Union (TSU) for the year-end legislative and local government
elections. The TSU is a newly founded political group which regards
Lee as its spiritual leader.</P>
      <P>Lee's behavior so angered KMT members that he was ousted from the
party Sept. 21.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAINLAND CHINA'S COMPETITIVENESS `OVERRATED': ECONOMIC OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  4 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An economic official claimed Thursday that
fraud and corruption in mainland China have eaten up between 13
percent and 17 percent of its gross national product and that the
country's competitive edge has been overblown.</P>
      <P>Lee Kao-chao, vice chairman of the Council for Economic Planning
and Development, said that the mainland should share only a portion
of global investments by Taiwan businessmen and that such businessmen
should not rely on the mainland too much.</P>
      <P>He also said that Taiwan, Hong Kong and mainland China should
make good use of their individual advantages and cooperate between
themselves to face global competition.</P>
      <P>Lee made the remarks at a symposium on how Taiwan industry can
deal with globalization by entering the greater China market, which
was sponsored by the non-profit Taiwan Institute of Economic Research
and attended by businessmen as well as government officials.</P>
      <P>Lee said that as manufacturers seek to globalize and cope with
competition from their rivals, they have moved their production bases
out of Taiwan in droves, citing as an example that Taiwan's
information technology industry last year used mainland China as the
base for overseas production.</P>
      <P>More than 85 percent of Taiwan-produced keyboards, mice and
scanners were made in the mainalnd last year, making
competitiveness between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait even more
fierce, Lee said.</P>
      <P>He also quoted an article titled "Much Exaggeration of the
Economic Challenge from China" carried by the Aug. 30 edition of the
International Herald Tribute that said the advantage of the mainland
is mainly "cheap labor, not rapidly rising skills."</P>
      <P>In addition, the article also said that "almost all the
higher-tech Chinese output depends on Taiwanese and other foreign
know-how and on tax breaks," and that mainland China's export
competitiveness remains concentrated in labor-intensive products of
foreign-owned factories."</P>
      <P>Lee said that although the mainland economy continues to grow
rapidly, its legal system is not yet healthy and complete, local
protectionism is rampant, its policy lacks transparency, corruption
among its cadres is serious, and the practice of bogus products and
rampant tax evasion have resulted in tax revenue losses of up to 100
billion renminbi yearly.</P>
      <P>Official statistics by the mainland also show that up to 66
percent of state-owned enterprises fake their financial reports, up
to 50 percent of individual companies evade taxes, and between 15
percent and 20 percent of the budget earmarked for infrastructure
construction is siphoned off through fraud, bribery and shabby public
works.</P>
      <P>Lee said that the pursuit of mutual benefits and prosperity have
been the axis of the Republic of China government's mainland policy.
Taiwan, with its geographical and cultural advantages and its rich
experience in international trade, should make good use of the
advantages of Taiwan, Hong Kong and mainland China to become the key
to Chinese economic circles, he went on.</P>
      <P>He pointed out the resources, markets, development strategies and
technologies of the three places are different and that all three
have also developed their own respective development patterns and
industrial situations, offering room for cooperation, although he
warned that Taiwan's trade opportunity lies not in mainland China but
in the global market.</P>

    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung  County,  southern Taiwan, Oct. 4 (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Taiwan doctor
who has been studying Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) announced the
results of his research Thursday and said that the 110 outbreaks of
CJD in Taiwan since 1996 are not related to diet or profession.</P>
      <P>Chen Shun-sheng, the neurology department director at Kaohsiung
Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, said that 92.7 percent of the 49 men
and 61 women who contracted the brain-wasting disease were over 50
years old.</P>
      <P>He said that the CJD and a new variant -- vCJD -- are both prion
diseases like bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), more commonly
known as mad cow disease.</P>
      <P>A prion is a self-replicating protein that researchers believe is
responsible for causing sponge-like holes inside the brain of
affected cattle or humans.</P>
      <P>No direct evidence has been discovered to prove that the prion
that causes BSE also causes CJD, but the possible spread of the BSE
prion from cattle to humans has caused alarm in Europe and the United
States in recent years.</P>
      <P>Chen said that most of the cases around the world where humans
have contracted CJD after ingesting BSE-contaminated beef products
were of the new variant, but that all of the 110 cases in Taiwan were
of the original CJD strain.</P>
      <P>Avoiding beef or beef products from BSE-affected regions is the
first step toward protection against CJD, he added.</P>
      <P>Chen urged the public not to be overly worried, pointing out that
the government has already banned the import of relevant products
from BSE-affected regions and that the 0.8-in-a-million average rate
of CJD contraction in Taiwan is lower than the world average of
one-in-a-million.</P>
      <P>Chen's research was sponsored by the Center for Disease Control
under the Department of Health.</P>

      <P>Atomic Energy Council (AEC) officials said

      <P>The officials said the incident took place Sept. 24, when six
tons of boric acid leaked from a tank at the first generator of the
second nuclear power plant in Chinshan, Taipei County, during
maintenance work. The acid is supposed to act as the last line of
defense in the event of a reactor meltdown.</P>

is officially quitting the basketball scene in Taiwan and relocating
to mainland China.</P>
      <P>Daniel Chiang, president of the British Virgin Islands-based

team name when it competes in mainland China's National Basketball

      <P>Chiang, who flew back to Taiwan from mainland China earlier in

and the nine Taiwan-based players to their new home in Suzhou in
Jiangsu Province.</P>
      <P>The players from Taiwan will be joined by two players hired from
the United States and two from mainland China.</P>
      <P>The team, which was founded in December last year, will represent

      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung said Thursday that

northern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The 7.3-magnitude killer temblor of Sept. 21, 1999 caused the

      <P>Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council (MAC)
urged Beijing Thursday to refrain from setting up political hurdles
to bilateral civilian exchanges after a group of mainland
rollerskaters competing in Taiwan repeatedly lodged complaints on
political issues.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet-level MAC, which is the government's highest
policy-making body in mainland China affairs, released a statement
saying that all international tournaments held in Taiwan follow the
"Olympic model," but the model cannot be applied outside of the
sporting venue and cannot be used to govern the actions of members of
the public.</P>
      <P>A day earlier, the mainland team competing in an ongoing Asian
rollerskating tournament in eastern Taiwan had complained about the
presence of an ROC flag inside the venue, prompting its removal by
the tournament organizers, who were bound to do so under a previous
agreement.</P>
      <P>The move, however, angered local residents, who then hoisted
hundreds of the nation's flags outside the rink and cut down the
mainland flag under cover of darkness, whereupon the mainland team
threatened to quit the competition altogether in protest.</P>
      <P>The MAC statement noted that the "self-initiated" actions of the
residents who hoisted the flags and the waving of the ROC flag by the
crowd watching the competition do not interfere with the competition,
and that the tournament organizers are in no position to prevent them
from such actions.</P>
      <P>The MAC also extended its "sympathies" to the "mainland
professionals who carry the burden of conducting political
interventions" during bilateral exchanges.</P>
      <P>It called for mutual respect and urged mainland China to stop
"doing things that would hurt the feelings of the people from both

    <HEADLINE>TREND MICRO TO LAUNCH NEW ANTI-VIRUS SOFTWARE ON TAIWAN MARKET</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 5 (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Tokyo-based Trend Micro Inc. will launch its
newly developed PC-cillin 2002, an anti-virus scanning program for
home computers and wireless devices, on the Taiwan market at the end
of October, a company spokesman said Friday.</P>
      <P>He said that PC-cillin 2002 is a new version of the company's
PC-cillin series applicable to personal digital assistants (PDAs),
palms, and pocket PCs. With its "personal firewall" function, the
software can defend against malicious viruses such as "CodeRed" and
"Nimda" as well as unique threats hidden inside files, email or on
the web.</P>
      <P>Trend Micro earlier offered a trial run of the program to 5,500
Internet users in Taiwan. A survey regarding virus attacks was
conducted among the trial copy users.</P>
      <P>The company spokesman said that the survey report showed that 66
percent of the respondents said that their computers or systems had
been infected with a virus, and 47 percent said they were able to
scan the viruses within 30 minutes and rehabilitate their computer's
functions.</P>
      <P>With the expansion of Internet applications, viruses have more
and more entry points into computers and wireless devices. PC-cillin
2002 can provide automatic real-time scanning to prevent viruses from
entering a device during beaming, synchronizing, mailing or Internet
downloading, according to the spokesman.</P>
      <P>Trend Micro Inc. is a leader in network anti-virus and Internet
content security software and services. According to a recently
published report from International Data Corporation (IDC), Trend
Micro dominates 33 percent of the overall anti-virus server market,
31 percent of the groupware market, and 63 percent of the Internet
gateway (web server) market.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  5  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Deng Pufang, the eldest son of the late
mainland China patriarch Deng Xiaoping and an activist on behalf of
the disabled, will arrive in Taipei early next month for his first
ever visit to Taiwan, a major local daily reported Friday.</P>
      <P>The United Daily News reported that Deng, invited by the Chinese
Taipei Paralympic Committee, will attend as a distinguished guest the
Far East &amp; South Pacific Games Federation for the Disabled Table
Tennis ranking tournament series scheduled for Nov. 10-11 in Taipei.</P>
      <P>The reports said that one of Deng's big wishes had been to visit
Taiwan before he died. The younger Deng had seven years ago said
clearly that he had "a great desire" to visit Taiwan, but the trip
never took place because of his sensitive status.</P>
      <P>Deng Pufang will fulfill his father's dream of visiting Taiwan
next month, the reports added.</P>
      <P>It is known that federations for the disabled in Shandong, Henan,
Hebei, Hunan, Guangxi, Anhui and Fujian will send their best athletes
to travel to Taiwan with Deng for the tournament. Taiwan has approved
Deng's visit as a show of its goodwill regarding promoting
cross-strait civilian exchanges, the reports said.</P>
      <P>The 58-year-old Deng, who graduated from the physics department
at Beijing University, suffered a great deal during the 10-year
Cultural Revolution on the mainland. In 1968, he and his younger
sister Deng Nan were held in the laboratory at Beijing University for
up to four months. It was reported that Deng tried to take his own
life by jumping out of a window of the building because he could no
longer bear the torture.</P>
      <P>Deng sustained spine injuries and was paralyzed from the waist
down because he did not receive treatment early enough. Deng was
finally able to receive surgery in Canada in 1980, and since the
operation, has been able to move around freely in a wheelchair.</P>
      <P>Suffering from paralysis, Deng vowed to dedicate the rest of his
life to the promotion of disabled people's welfare. He is also the
director in chief of the China Welfare Fund for the Handicapped.</P>

    <HEADLINE>JUSTICE MINISTER DEFENDS NT$ 30 STANDARD FOR VOTE-BUYING VIOLATIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  5  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Justice Minister Chen Ding-nan on Friday
defended the justification for the NT$30 (US$0.87) standard for
vote-buying violations, saying that the decision will not be altered
despite widespread criticism.</P>
      <P>Chen said the decision to fix at NT$30 the level above which law
enforcement authorities can prosecute an individual for vote-buying
violations was made by the State Public Prosecutor General's Office
after a consensus was reached with prosecutor generals and leading
prosecutors at all levels.</P>
      <P>He stressed the decision, which has been ridiculed by some
politicians and elected representatives as unrealistic, will not be
changed as the government is determined to stamp out vote-buying in
the elections for legislators, city mayors and county chiefs
scheduled for Dec. 1.</P>
      <P>Chen reiterated that the government is determined to ensure that
the year-end elections are not sullied by what has become commonplace
in Taiwan politics -- gifts of money or goods in exchange for votes.</P>
      <P>He also said that if the NT$30 standard is not regulated,
candidates who give out small campaign items, such as lighters, lunar
calendars or packs of tissue, could easily be convicted of
vote-buying by any prosecutor.</P>
      <P>The NT$30 standard actually serves as a form of protection for
candidates to-be, Chen said, adding that it also provides prosecutors
with a clear-cut definition on determining vote-buying violations.</P>
      <P>Expressing evident disapproval with Chen's endorsement of the
NT$30 standard, Wu Nai-jen, secretary-general of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party, criticized the decision as "totally
unrealistic," and described Chen as an "unworldly" justice minister.</P>
      <P>Kuomintang Legislator Cheng Feng-shih ridiculed Chen as a
"Martian" from outer space who knows nothing about matters on Earth,
especially about Taiwan politics.</P>

    <HEADLINE>`WAR IS NOT THE ANSWER' TO SEPT. 11 TERRORIST ATTACKS: CIVIC GROUPS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 5 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Amid reports of an imminent U.S. assault on
Afghanistan, more than 100 Taiwan civic groups issued a joint
statement Friday, expressing opposition to any military response to
the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in the United States.</P>
      <P>Representatives of the civic groups said at a joint news
conference held at the Legislative Yuan that "war is not the answer"
to the terrorist attacks that brought down the twin towers of New
York City's World Trade Center and partially damaged the Pentagon --
the U.S. military nerve center.</P>
      <P>Legislator Chien Hsi-chieh of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party, also the chief executive officer (CEO) of the Peacetime
Foundation, said local civic groups define the Sept. 11 attacks as a
crime that should be tried and judged by the International Court of
Justice -- the principal judicial organ of the United Nations.</P>
      <P>Noting that the atrocity of Sept. 11 is a global issue, not just
a U.S. national affair, Chien said the United States should bring the
case to the International Court of Justice and let the perpetrators
be tried fairly, justly and openly under the U.N. mechanism.</P>
      <P>"Only by so doing can the world avoid the fate of plunging into
the vicious cycle of eye-for-eye, violence-for-violence
retaliation," Chien noted.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, Chen Chun-liang, the CEO of the
Eden Social Welfare Foundation, said his foundation is strongly
opposed to planned U.S. military strikes on any nation suspected of
being involved in the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks or of sheltering the
perpetrators of the attacks.</P>
      <P>"Once the retaliatory attacks are put into action, it is evident
that many innocent lives will be lost and many other people may be
crippled," Chen said, adding that all countries around the world
should forgo revenge in a spirit of charity.</P>
      <P>In addition to the civic groups, many individual scholars,
experts and professionals have also signed the "anti-war, love peace"
joint statement.</P>
      <P>In related news developments, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
(MOFA) reaffirmed Friday the Republic of China government's support
for the ongoing U.S.-led anti-global terrorism campaign.</P>
      <P>The MOFA said in a press release that the ROC government will
adopt a series of judicial and administrative measures in tandem with
its domestic law and the spirit of various U.N.-sponsored
anti-terrorism conventions and resolutions to deny money, support and
sanctuary to terrorists.</P>
      <P>The ROC will also step up exchanges of "operational
information," especially regarding the actions and movements of
terrorists, with other countries as well as provide all necessary
assistance in relevant investigation and criminal suit procedures,
the MOFA statement said.</P>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung said in a weekly Cabinet meeting
Wednesday that although the ROC has been shut out of the United
Nations since 1971 simply because of political reasons, it will never
waver its support for the global anti-terrorism campaign.</P>
      <P>In a significant international response to the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks, the U.N. Security Council (UNSC) unanimously
approved last Friday a resolution requiring all 189 U.N.-member
nations to deny money, support and sanctuary to terrorists.</P>
      <P>Under the legally binding resolution, all countries must make the
"willful" financing of terrorism a criminal offense, immediately
freeze terrorist-related funds and prevent movement of individuals
and groups suspected of having terrorist connections. All member
nations must deny terrorists any "safe haven." Additionally, nations
must speed the exchange of "operational information," especially
regarding the actions and movements of terrorists.</P>

      <P>Taiwan will not be absent from the 
international fruits and vegetables exposition to be held in mainland
China next month, Legislator Lin Feng-hsi from the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party said Friday.</P>
      <P>Actually, Lin will lead a 100-strong Taiwan delegation of
farmers, traders and food processors to the international fruits and
vegetables expo scheduled to be held Oct. 11-14 in Xiamen, Fujian
Province.</P>
      <P>Lin said the international expo, co-sponsored by UNESCAP (the
United Nations Economic and Social Council in Asian-Pacific), will
serve as a bridgehead for Taiwan-produced fruits and vegetables at a
time when Taiwan products will soon face fiercer competition when the
island accedes to the World Trade Organization (WTO).</P>
      <P>Under the banner of "Subtropics, Taiwan Fresh," Taiwan-produced
fruits and vegetables will be displayed in 50 booths at the four-day
expo, in which more than 1,000 companies from 22 countries as well as
the host mainland China will take part, Lin noted.</P>
      <P>He added that the expo provides a golden opportunity for Taiwan
in its self-promotion efforts under the globally-fair trading
environment provided by the WTO program.</P>
      <P>It is hoped that Taiwan's delicious fresh fruits and vegetables
will become world-brand products enjoying fame equal to that of
salmon from Norway, tulips from the Netherlands and kiwi fruit from
New Zealand, Lin said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FILM INDUSTRY IN NEED OF GOVERNMENT SUPPORT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  5 (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Representatives of the local film industry
urged the government Friday to provide adequate assistance to the
industry, the existence of which, they said, might be further
threatened by imported films when Taiwan is admitted into the World
Trade Organization (WTO).</P>
      <P>At a public hearing at the Legislative Yuan, Wang Ying-hsiang,
chairman of the Motion Picture Foundation, said that the government
should learn from mainland China, Hong Kong, South Korea and Thailand
and map out protective measures for the healthy development of the
domestic film business.</P>
      <P>Since the late 1980s, Taiwan's film industry has been constantly
on the brink of collapse, faced by fierce competition from film
studios in Hong Kong and giant international movie companies.</P>
      <P>Officials of the fragile movie industry fear that the
cancellation of an import quota on foreign films and the suspension
of duty on foreign films to meet WTO requirements will pose more
difficulties to the industry. Since 1992, the government has charged
extra import duty on foreign films, which is funneled into a fund
managed by the Government Information Office (GIO) to subsidize local
film production.</P>
      <P>Statistics released by the GIO Friday indicate that among the
more-than 400 films shown in Taiwan last year, only 35 were locally
produced, 128 were Hong Kong productions and 280 were imported
foreign language films.</P>
      <P>In the first eight months of this year, Taiwan's movie studios
produced just eight films, all with subsidies from the government.</P>
      <P>Even with the subsidies, local movie producers are hesitant to
make new films due to marketing difficulties, according to a GIO
source.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that there are 196 theaters with 619 screens
around the island. Last year, he went on, the GIO tried to coordinate
these theaters to show locally produced films, but so far, only five
locally produced films have been scheduled into their programs.</P>
      <P>Movie producer Wang Ying-hsiang suggested that the government
help cultivate the film industry under the umbrella of cultural
affairs, instead of treating the sector as part of the entertainment
business.</P>
      <P>The Hong Kong government, he noted, has set aside NT$100 million
HK dollars for a fund for good screenplays, while South Korean film
production companies get tax rebate. These incentives, he said, would
help stimulate investment interest in the sector.</P>
      <P>Chiu Shun-ching, director-general of Central Motion Picture
Corp., said that in Thailand and South Korea, all foreign films must
be dubbed, thus providing many job opportunities for the film
industry. He suggested that the authorities concerned adopt similar
practices.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER SAYS PERFORMANCE OVER PAST YEAR `NOT IDEAL'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.5  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung said Friday that
although he has spent a lot of time and energy on the nation's
economy, his performance "has not been ideal" during his one year in
office.</P>
      <P>The premier was responding to questions during the general
interpellation session of the Legislative Yuan when Legislator Chang
Fu-hsing of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) asked him about his
thoughts over the past year, as well as his best and worst moments.</P>
      <P>Chang noted that the nation has undergone political reform, a
series of natural disasters and a changed world situation, including
a continued sluggish economy and the terrorist attacks in New York
and Washington, over the past year.</P>
      <P>He said he was grateful that during his year in office, the
political situation remained stable and that the series of tests did
not lead to the toppling of the Cabinet, as were the cases in Japan,
the Philippines and Indonesia.</P>
      <P>He also said that the Cabinet has devoted a lot of time and
energy to the economy and has also begun overhauling ailing
fundamental financial institutions, although he conceded that the
performance in this regard has been less than ideal.</P>
      <P>He also said the focus of the 2002 fiscal budget is on economic
development, citing as an example the fact that the budget for
high-tech industries such as telecommunications and agricultural
biotechnology will continue to rise in the hope that these sectors
will form the backbone of the development of Taiwan's economy, just
as the semiconductor industry did two decades ago.</P>
      <P>He estimated that the budget earmarked for economic development
will be NT$600.8 billion (US$17.31 billion) for the fiscal year.</P>
      <P>Responding to questions on whether he will stay on as premier
after the year-end legislative elections, Chang said that he will
"respect the wishes of the president" concerning whether to stay on
after the Dec. 1 elections.</P>
      <P>Legislators also questioned whether the listed revenue of more
than NT$1.3 trillion listed in the 2002 fiscal budget is reasonable
at a time when the economy remains sluggish and accused the
government of miscalculating the economic growth rate.</P>
      <P>The premier said that although there could be a tax revenue
shortfall, other forms of revenue could increase. He added that the
gap should not be too large.</P>
      <P>Lin Chuang, director-general of the Directorate General of
Budget, Accounting and Statistics, also noted that the Cabinet had
originally predicted that economic recovery would come in the fourth
quarter, but since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in the United
States, there is now doubt as to whether the 4 percent economic
growth rate can be reached and that everything now depends on
November's performance.</P>
      <P>The premier also said that the decision to float government bonds
will have to be made after considering the cost involved and the
squeeze it would put on domestic capitals, but his finance minister,
Yen Ching-chang, said that the nation has ample capital and that the
flotation of bonds would not squeeze domestic capital.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN URGED TO OVERHAUL FINANCE REGIME TO WEATHER GLOBAL SLOWNESS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 5 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan was urged Friday by a respected U.S.
economics guru to overhaul its domestic financial regime to allow it
to weather the global economic sluggishness that has been worsened by
the recent terrorist attacks in the United States.</P>
      <P>Lester C. Thurow, an economics professor with the prestigious
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said that Taiwan, which has
been heavily reliant on the United States in its process of economic
development, actually cannot do much to address the situation other
than waiting for the United States to recover.</P>
      <P>The only other realistic thing that Taiwan can do at present is
to overhaul its financial sector and nurture more professionals to
allow the island be ready to "rise again," Thurow said in a speech
delivered Friday at the Epoch Foundation Economics Forum in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's economic rebound hinges on the recovery of the United
States, Thurow reiterated, adding that it is hard to speculate
exactly how long it will take before the American "U-shaped" economic
downturn bottoms out in the wake of the Sept. 11 terror attacks in
New York City and Washington.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is not alone in this round of recession, Thurow said,
adding that Japan and Singapore are also reeling.</P>
      <P>He did not attach much expectation to expected increased U.S.
military spending once retaliatory action against Afghanistan's
Taleban regime is launched, saying that while the war may fuel
defense demands, the specific expenditure would not be a factor of
the U.S. economic growth.</P>
      <P>Although a great number of Taiwan businesses have relocated their
operations to mainland China, he said Taiwan still cannot count on
the mainland's economic prosperity to help with the island's
recovery. With its gross domestic product constituting only 3 percent
of the global economy, mainland China is far from being able to play
a "world-level" role, he added.</P>
      <P>Commenting on Thurow's suggestions, Paul Hsu, executive director
of Epoch Foundation, said that from the point of view of
international economics specialists, Taiwan should have a clearer
perception of its own economic situation and future.</P>

official said Friday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a regular news conference, Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC) Vice Chairman Lin Chong-pin said that according to sources in
the United States, Beijing has not so far raised any request to
Washington in exchange for its willingness to cooperate in the global
anti-terrorist movement.</P>
      <P>As the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks were a major disaster for the
international community, Lin pointed out that any country would be
condemned by international society should it try to use the tragedy
to boost its own interests and added that mainland China is concerned
about being a outcast in the Washington-Beijing-Moscow ties because
Russia has also displayed goodwill to the United States following the
tragedy.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell has also
made it clear that Washington-Beijing cooperation against terrorism
will not be made at the cost of Taiwan's interests and neither will
it affect security in the Taiwan Strait.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP LAWMAKER VOWS TO BLOCK THUG-LAWMAKER'S RE-ELECTION BID</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Oct.  5  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A veteran legislator of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) said Friday he will do his utmost
to prevent a controversial incumbent lawmaker from winning a seat in
the new Legislative Yuan to be elected Dec. 1.</P>
      <P>Shen Fu-hsiung, a medical doctor-turned-lawmaker, said that many
people think Lo Fu-chu, an independent legislator who is widely
believed to be the "spiritual leader" of the Heavenly Way Alliance
gang, can easily win a legislative seat in the metropolitan Taipei
South constituency.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Shen said at a news conference, he will join forces
with four other DPP candidates for the constituency legislative
elections to block Lo's re-election bid.</P>
      <P>In the previous legislative elections, Lo consistently ran in the
Taipei County constituency. This time, however, he is likely to run
in the Taipei City South constituency, as he has relocated his legal
abode to the district.</P>
      <P>Lo is now serving a six-month suspension from legislative duty
following his brutal assault of a female colleague in April. His
latest display of thuggish behavior was nothing new, as he has an
extensive history of using his fists rather than his intellect to
conduct his legislative business.</P>
      <P>On Wednesday, Lo harangued and intimidated members of the
legislature's finance committee for one hour simply because the DPP
legislative caucus had questioned the validity of electing his son Lo
Ming-tsai as convener of the committee. The junior Lo, also a
legislator, was elected to the committee's convener seat last week
for a third consecutive term, breaking an internal rule of the
chamber that forbids any lawmaker serving as a convener of any
committee for three straight sessions. The senior Lo's invective
halted the committee's plan to conduct a new run of convener
elections on that day.</P>
      <P>Shen said that Lo's invective highlights the need to revise and
update the legislature's internal rules to upgrade legislative
operational efficiency and improve the chamber's image.</P>
      <P>Shen said the DPP will push for revisions to the rules regarding
the number of legislators needed to form a caucus and the number of
conveners of each legislative standing committee.</P>
      <P>He said the current regulation that allow each committee to have
three conveners reflects the "old" culture of pork-barrel politics.
In his view, Shen said, the number of conveners should be cut to one
for each committee.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, Shen went on, the number of legislators needed
to form a caucus should be largely increased to control the number of
legislative caucuses. At present, five legislators can form a caucus
to qualify for presenting bills for screening. The relatively lax
restrictions on the number of legislative caucuses has hindered
legislative operations, he pointed out.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOST TAIWAN FAMILY INCOMES BELOW AVERAGE LEVEL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  5  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Some 68 percent of Taiwan's 6.59 million
households, or 4.47 million families, earned an annual income of less
than the average level of NT$1.09 million (US$31,600) in 2000,
according to government statistics released recently.</P>
      <P>Affected by an economic downturn since the second half of 2000,
per-household average annual income hit NY$1.09 million for the whole
of last year, a record low increase of 0.17 percent over the 1999
level, according to the tallies released by the Directorate General
of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS).</P>
      <P>The 68 percent ratio is about the same level posted previously
for 1999, DGBAS officials said.</P>
      <P>In terms of householders' professions, manufacturing-related
occupations, such as machine operators, fishermen and laborers posted
noticeable falls in their yearly family earnings amid rising
unemployment, while workers in service-related businesses, such as
vendors and salesmen registered the highest growth of 2.9 percent in
their annual incomes, the same statistics indicate.</P>
      <P>Public opinion leaders, ranking government officials and private
business executives are in the upper level in terms of their family
incomes. Only about 7 percent of Taiwan's entire households belong to
this group, enjoying an average annual income of NT$1.9 million per
household last year, down 1.2 percent from the 1999 level.</P>
      <P>Ranking second are the professional elite, with 5.6 percent of
Taiwan's families being classified as led by such householders, who
earned an average annual income of NT$1.8 million in 2000, up 0.1
percent from a year ago.</P>
      <P>Families of householders who are high-level technicians and
assistant specialists account for 13.8 percent of Taiwan's
households, with an average yearly income of NT$1.4 million, down 2
percent year-on-year.</P>
      <P>Families of householders who are office workers and service
providers such as vendors account for 5.3 percent and 14 percent of
Taiwan's overall families, earning annual incomes of NT$1.2 million
and NT$1.04 million, respectively, per household.</P>
      <P>Families supported by technicians make up 13.4 percent, with
average annual earnings of NT$1.03 million. Ranking at the bottom are
families whose householders work in the agricultural, forestry and
fishing sectors, with an annual income of NT$690,000.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DECISION TO IMPLEMENT FLEXIBLE WORK HOURS BASED ON POLL: OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 5 (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An official of the Cabinet-level Council of
Labor Affairs (CLA) said Friday that a decision of the Economic
Development Advisory Conference in August to endorse flexible work
hours corresponds to the results of a survey conducted in April.</P>
      <P>In response to some labor groups' opposition to the decision,
which was accepted by the Cabinet and worked into an amendment bill
for the relevant labor laws, CLA Statistics Department Director Lin
Lee-jen said that 39.4 percent of the survey respondents voiced
support for flexible work hours, compared to 17.7 percent who were
opposed.</P>
      <P>However, 43 percent of the respondents did not express an
opinion.</P>
      <P>Lin said that the results of the survey were submitted to the
advisory conference for its reference in coming up with the decision.</P>
      <P>Of the management respondents surveyed, 49.6 percent said that
they support the proposal and only 8.7 percent were opposed, while
41.7 percent had no opinion.</P>
      <P>A total of 2,780 effective responses from the management sector
and 6,746 from the labor sector were retrieved over the course of the
month-long mail-in survey.</P>
      <P>The survey results also showed that supporters of proposals to
ease restrictions on labor laws governing female employees working at
night or working overtime also outnumber those who oppose the plans.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet ratified a draft amendment last month for the Labor
Standard Law that aims to provide guidelines for businesses and
workers that wish to accommodate more flexible working hours.</P>
      <P>If ratified by the Legislative Yuan, the new guidelines will
allow businesses to make their own scheduling adjustments provided
that both labor and management agree to the new schemes.</P>
      <P>Businesses whose average weekly working hours do not surpass 40
hours can move those hours around either within an eight-week period
or within a one-year period, as long as other labor regulations on
maximum daily and weekly working hours are not violated, according to
the draft amendment.</P>
      <P>The amendment also seeks to simplify the procedure for working
overtime such that -- subject to labor and management agreement --
workers can work overtime as long as the total number of scheduled
working hours plus overtime hours does not exceed 12 hours each day,
and provided the total number of overtime hours each month does not
exceed 46 hours.</P>
      <P>In the interests of gender equality, female workers under the
proposed regulations will be allowed to work at night between 10 p.m.
and 6 a.m. -- also subject to labor and management agreement -- if
the workplace provides the necessary health and safety facilities,
transportation or dormitory facilities for female workers.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN'S ECONOMIC STRUCTURE SOLID: NATIONAL POLICY ADVISER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Oct.  4  (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung and Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Republic of China national policy
adviser expressed optimism Thursday that Taiwan's economy will
recover soon in tune with the world economy, as Taiwan enjoys a solid
economic structure.</P>
      <P>Byron S.J. Weng, national policy adviser to ROC President Chen
Shui-bian, made the remarks in Washington after meeting with American
think tank experts to exchange views about cross-Taiwan Strait ties
and Taipei-Washington relations.</P>
      <P>Accompanying him on his U.S trip are Taiwan Institute of Economic
Research President Wu Rong-i and adviser to the National Security
Council Lin Chia-long.</P>
      <P>Weng, who is also a professor at Taiwan's National Chi-Nan
University, said that although Taiwan's economic performance is not
very good at present, it will take a turn for the better when the
world economy recovers.</P>
      <P>Referring to the domestic political chaos, Weng attributed this
to the Democratic Progressive Party's lack of experience as a ruling
party and the opposition parties' equal lack of experience. He added
that whether the political situation will stabilize depends largely
on the results of the year-end legislative and county chief
elections.</P>
      <P>Weng went on to say that during their meeting with various think
tank experts in Los Angeles, New York and Washington, they had made
known Taipei's worry as to whether the United States will reach any
agreement with Beijing that will sacrifice Taiwan's interests in
exchange for mainland China's cooperation in its anti-terrorist
campaign.</P>
      <P>However, the worry was later assuaged when U.S. Secretary of
State Colin Powell stressed Wednesday during an unrelated meeting
with reporters that the United States will not make any deals to the
detriment of Taiwan's interests when trying to obtain Beijing's
anti-terrorist cooperation.</P>
      <P>Weng was scheduled to head for Boston later in the day to meet
other American scholars.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's consumer price index (CPI)
registered a year-on-year drop of 0.51 percent in September, the
second fall since June, according to statistics released Friday by
the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS).</P>
      <P>The island's wholesale price index (WPI) in September fell 1.43
percent from a year earlier, the seventh consecutive and largest drop
in two years, DGBAS figures showed.</P>
      <P>The fall of the September CPI was due mainly to a higher
comparative base in September last year, which saw higher vegetable
and fruit prices in the aftermath of Typhoon Bilis, the DGBAS said.</P>
      <P>However, the September CPI was 0.42 percent higher from that of
August, due mainly to higher vegetable and fruit prices after Typhoon
Nari and Lekima, according to DGBAS statistics.</P>
      <P>The fall of the September WPI was due mainly to the slower demand
and falling prices of raw materials, the DGBAS said.</P>
      <P>In the first nine months of this year, the island's CPI has
registered a year-on-year growth of 0.2 percent, the DGBAS figures
showed.</P>
      <P>The island's 2001 CPI is expected to maintain moderate growth, a
DGBAS official said, adding that the level is expected to be
controlled under 0.41-percent.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Nine members of the Taiwan-financed Sina
basketball team left for the mainland Chinese city of Suzhou Friday
to play in mainland China's Division A league in December.</P>
      <P>Daniel Chiang, president of the British Virgin Islands-based
E-Ternational Sports Ventures Co., which owns Sina, accompanied the
group to Suzhou via Macau.</P>
      <P>Chiang said prior to his departure that although the row over the
team's name remains unresolved, Sina will not pull out of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"We'll keep our roots in Taiwan while venturing into the mainland
basketball arena," Chiang said, adding that the team will retain its
Taiwan flavor and will continue to recruit players from the island.</P>
      <P>Chiang further said the Sina foundation will continue to sponsor
youth basketball summer camps and the annual Sina Cup basketball
tournament in Taiwan to help cultivate a new generation of basketball
talent.</P>
      <P>Chou Chun-san, captain of the team, said he and his teammates
hope to carve out a niche in the highly competitive mainland
basketball scene with the blessing of fans on both sides of the
Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The nine players from Taiwan will be joined by two players hired
from the United States and two from mainland China. The top-ranking
basketball league is scheduled to begin its new season Dec. 8, with a
match in Suzhou between Sina and Beijing's Capital Steel team.</P>
      <P>It remains uncertain what Sina's official designation will be
while competing in the mainland's Division A league. Chiang said he
felt some regret that he couldn't decide on the team's name himself.</P>
      <P>In consideration of the sensitive political situation across the
Taiwan Strait, Chiang said he would no longer insist on the team's
official title.</P>
      <P>During a courtesy call on Mainland Affairs Council (MAC)
Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen Thursday, Chiang presented a list of five
alternative names for the nation's top mainland policy planner to
consider. Tsai reportedly had assured Chiang that the MAC would be
flexible on the name issue.</P>
      <P>Sina ran into trouble with local authorities in charge of sports
and mainland Chinese affairs under pressure from Beijing to add
either "Taiwan" or "Taipei" to its team name to be allowed to play in
mainland China.</P>
      <P>The proposed addition to the team's designation drew a sharp
response from government officials in Taipei as they considered it to
be yet another scheme concocted by Beijing to make Taiwan look like
just another province of the People's Republic of China.</P>

    <HEADLINE>OPERATION FOUND MINTING BOGUS COINS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.5  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>On the same day that a special government
task force was assembled to fight recent high-profile currency
counterfeiting cases, an operation was discovered in southern Taiwan
that was minting phony coins, police said Friday.</P>
      <P>Police had been monitoring the clandestine mint in Taichung City
since June, but had been unable to make any arrests as the factory
was moved frequently.</P>
      <P>Their luck changed when police caught one of the suspected
operators of the bogus mint on Friday and seized around 260 fake
NT$50 coins and materials -- including dies to manufacture every
denomination of coin used in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>A 59-year-old man, Lin Wu-nan, was arrested at the site. He said
that the minting operation had already made and sold bogus coins
amounting to a face value of NT$10 million. He also said that dies
were used to mint the newly designed coins of the Central Bank of
China (CBC) which are not yet in circulation.</P>
      <P>According to preliminary investigations, the mastermind behind
the operation is a retired banker who is still at large.</P>
      <P>Police quoted Lin as saying that most of the counterfeited coins
produced were sold to video game arcades in southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Also on Friday, a government task force on currency
counterfeiting was created and staffed by officials from the Central
Bank of China (CBC), the ministries of finance and justice, the
Investigation Bureau and the National Police Administration. The team
will be headed by Wu Kuo-ai, the chief prosecutor of the Taiwan High
Court.</P>
      <P>Representatives of the task force said at a news conference that
they had come up with three initial points in the fight against
counterfeiting: First, any information about currency forgery must be
relayed immediately to the task force as well as the CBC. Second, the
CBC should establish a data bank on bogus bills, including how they
were counterfeited and how they were put into circulation. Third,
prosecutors should investigate classified advertisements that offer
get rich quick schemes that have vague references to counterfeit
currency.</P>
      <P>The task force also recommended that forgers be subject to
stricter penalties and advised that the government do more to educate
the public in the ways to distinguish real currency from fakes.</P>

      <P>The official from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) noted
that Taiwan will also attend the informal leadership meeting
scheduled for Oct. 20-21, but added that the choice of the
representative will be announced by the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>A news release by MOFA said that countries in the Asia-Pacific
area have been striving to lift up their economies, but the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks on the United States have brought a new dimension
to their efforts.</P>
      <P>Although the meeting is expected to face more challenges than
before, MOFA asserted that it will also provide a good opportunity
for member countries to find solutions to the problems ahead.</P>
      <P>The MOFA official said that the Taiwan delegation will discuss
with the participants from other member countries how to stimulate
the economies in the Asia-Pacific region in a way which will also
build the basis for Taiwan's sustainable development.</P>
      <P>Regarding the leadership conference to be attended by U.S.
President George W. Bush and the leaders of other member countries,
the official said that Taiwan will attend the conference.</P>
      <P>ROC President Chen Shui-bian has reiterated his willingness to
attend the Shanghai meeting, but Beijing has turned down Chen's
proposal.</P>
      <P>Last year, the Taipei-based Central Bank of China Governor Perng
Fai-nan represented Chen at the APEC leadership meeting in Brunei.</P>

      <P>A government survey released Thursday shows
that the public is often misinformed about fundamental health issues.</P>
      <P>The survey, commissioned by the Cabinet-level Department of
Health, was conducted in May by telephone and received valid

      <P>The results of the survey shows that men got an average score of
50.86 out of the maximum 100, while women scored 52.2.</P>
      <P>For example, when asked whether getting an injection or taking
medicine would guarantee recovery from influenza, only about half
understood that these treatments are not effective in all cases.</P>
      <P>The study also found that 41 percent have the misguided concept

less than Western medicines," while 45 percent know that taking

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan must open the "three links" with
mainland China if it hopes to act as a jumping-off point for foreign
businessmen in Taiwan who want to develop the Shanghai market, a
government official said Friday.</P>
      <P>Chen Chao-yi, director of the Industrial Development and
Investment Center under the Ministry of Economic Affairs said Taiwan
can replace Hong Kong in cross-Taiwan Strait trade activities for
foreign businesses. "But the key to that requires Taiwan's
establishment of direct trade, transportation and postal links with
the mainland," he noted.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, Taiwan enjoys the upper hand over Hong Kong in
its cultural and language links with mainland China. Foreign
investors used to enter mainland China's southern markets, such as
Guangzhou and Shantou, through Hong Kong, and now they can use Taiwan
to expand into the flourishing Shanghai market, which lies closer to
Taiwan than Hong Kong, he added.</P>
      <P>As global capital has being flowing quickly into the mainland
Chinese market ahead of its imminent entry into the World Trade
Organization, Taiwan should position itself so that it is not on the

      <P>Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan said
Friday that the ROC government must handle its mainland China ties in
line with global economic realities.</P>
      <P>"Because of poor coordination between Taiwan's ruling party and a

      <P>If the ruling party -- the Democratic Progressive Party -- cannot

said, it has no right to remain in power. He also said that Taiwan

      <P>Lien made the remarks while giving a speech to a KMT-sponsored
gathering for Taiwan businessmen based in mainland China.</P>
      <P>As mainland China has become the most important market for many

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  5 (CNA)
(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Presdient Chen Shui-bian
received visiting U.S. economist Lester Thurow Friday and exchanged
views with him on the economic problems faced by Taiwan and the rest
of the world.</P>
      <P>Chen explained to Thurow the government's decision to replace the
"no haste, be patient" policy with an "active opening, efficient
management" stance to handle trade and investment relations with
mainland China.</P>
      <P>The president described the new policy as a "new milestone" in
the development of cross-Taiwan Strait relations.</P>
      <P>He also stated that in order to implement the more than 300
recommendations reached through consensus at the recently-held
Economic Development Advisory Conference, necessary measures are
being worked out in the Legislative Yuan and relevant government
institutions.</P>
      <P>Chen said that the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in the United
States have affected not only the United States, but also Taiwan and
other countries.</P>
      <P>He added that the world's attention is also being drawn to the
upcoming informal leadership conference of the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation forum to be held later this month in Shanghai and the
ministerial meeting of the World Trade Organization to be held in
Qatar next month.</P>
      <P>During the reception, Chen asked Thurow what Taiwan should do to
cope with the current economic sluggishness.</P>
      <P>The economics professor from MIT said that Taiwan's economy will
be able to make an upturn only after the global economy begins to
rebound.</P>
      <P>For now, he suggested that Taiwan place more emphasis on
investment in public projects and follow the formula of Sweden to
strengthen skills training for unemployed workers.</P>
      <P>Through reeducation, Thurow said that fresh labor power can be
injected into the labor market once the economy begins bottoming out.</P>
      <P>Regarding the booming mainland Chinese market, he said that he
would not consider mainland China a big market at present because its
economic scale accounts for only 2 percent of the world economy.</P>
      <P>The professor noted that the consumption market in mainland China
is small, although it is a good place for manufacturing.</P>
      <P>He went on to say that it may take 100 years for mainland China
to expand its economy to the present scale of the United States, and
added that official statistics released by Beijing are questionable.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TWO FUGITIVES SUSPECTED AS ABDUCTORS OF VICE COUNCIL SPEAKER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  5  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Two fugitives wanted in at least a dozen
robberies were positively identified Friday as being behind the
kidnapping of Taichung City Council Vice Speaker Chang Hung-nien on
Monday.</P>
      <P>Chang, who was released unhurt Thursday, has identified the two
from police mug shots as Hsueh Chiu and Chen Yi-hua. The two men have
terrorized Hsinchu, Miaoli and Taichung and are suspected to be
involved in 12 robberies and one kidnapping since January.</P>
      <P>Chang told police that while he was being held, the two men had
showed their identification cards to him to prove that they were the
notorious fugitives.</P>
      <P>His statement confirmed the testimony given by two of Chang's
aides who were present when Chang was forced to leave his Taichung
office with the two men Oct. 1. The two aides also recognized the men
from police mug shots and from their voices on police interrogation
tape recordings.</P>
      <P>Police said the two men had been arrested on March 21 in Miaoli
City after a brief shootout and a subsequent two-hour standoff with
police who had responded to calls for help from a pub where the two
fugitives were brawling with workers.</P>
      <P>However, a judge of the Miaoli District Court released the two on
bail on March 22 in spite of prosecutors' demands for the men to be
detained. The two then jumped bail.</P>
      <P>The two men are suspects in at least five armed robberies since
March, including the holdup of a bank run by the farmers' association
in Yunlin County. The two made off with NT$20 million (US$588,235).</P>
      <P>The high-profile abduction of Chang is their latest claim to
infamy because of Chang's political status and the astronomical sum
they demanded for his release -- NT$300 million (US$8.82 million). In
fact, Chang reportedly actually paid between NT$30 million to NT$50
million (US$882,352 to US$1.47 million).</P>
      <P>But Chang, who has shunned publicity after being released
Thursday, downplayed the incident and said that the kidnapping was
most likely a case of mistaken identity as the two men, according to
Chang, were after someone else. He avoided answering any question
about if he had paid any ransom to secure his release.</P>
      <P>His father told reporters Friday that the two men released his
son after finding that they had taken the wrong person and that his
son had been treated well during the three days in captivity.</P>
      <P>However, media reports stuck to their stories that ransom had
been handed over before Chang was released.</P>
      <P>A local television station, TVBS, said three of Chang's friends,
two businessmen and one politician, who negotiated with the two men
after the kidnapping, handed over the ransom.</P>
      <P>TVBS said Chang's friends had kept the police in the dark about
the incident out of fear for Chang's safety. The friends only
notified police after Chang had been released Thursday.</P>
      <P>Also on Thursday, a judge of the Miaoli District Court rescinded
the earlier court's granting of bail.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 5 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Realizing that numerous traffic lights went
dark in the aftermath of Typhoon Nari, Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou
asked city maintenance crews Friday to dedicate their lives to
repairing broken traffic signals in any future emergency.</P>
      <P>In a meeting with the city's traffic officials, Ma expressed his
dismay at the fact that the city's traffic signals, which were
seriously damaged by Typhoon Nari on Sept. 16, were not fully back in
working order until Sept. 22.</P>
      <P>During those six days, Ma said, city residents had to suffer the
inconvenience and danger of non-functioning traffic lights. He said
that the disruption of the city's rapid transportation system only
add to the chaos as more that half a million commuters were forced to
find alternative ways to go to and from their offices.</P>
      <P>Since the city has farmed out the maintenance of its traffic
equipment to private contractors, the sudden breakdown of 700-odd
traffic signals during the storm caught them off-guard and they
couldn't find enough staff to attend to the signals which were either
damaged by flooding or rendered useless because of power outages
following the storm.</P>
      <P>Ma asked his staff to impose heavy fines on the contractors if
they failed to fix the signals after future natural disasters.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TOP AIDE QUITS PEOPLE FIRST PARTY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  6  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>One of the closest aides of opposition
People First Party (PFP) Chairman James Soong announced Friday in the
United States that he had quit the party that day for reasons that he
said he would explain "at an appropriate time."</P>
      <P>Shao Tsung-hai, a political science professor at National
Chengchi University and a special aide to Soong, said in a faxed
letter to Taipei that he decided to quit the PFP after long and
careful consideration.</P>
      <P>Shao said in the letter that his quitting the PFP has nothing to
do with the party's imminent nomination of candidates for
legislators-at-large, adding that he does not want people to get the
impression that he quit because he has not been nominated by the
party.</P>
      <P>Currently on a three-month academic exchange program at Harvard
University's Fairbank Center for East Asian Research, Shao said he
will give his reasons for quitting the PFP soon after he completes
his current dissertation titled "Future Political Negotiations Across
the Taiwan Strait and the Role of the United States."</P>
      <P>The following day, PFP Vice Chairman Chang Chao-hsiung announced
the list of candidates that the party has nominated for potential
legislators-at-large.</P>
      <P>Soong was not listed, while Liu Yi-ru, a former finance and
monetary professor at National Taiwan University and daughter of
former Finance Minister Shirley Kuo, was placed at the top of the
list of 26 candidates.</P>
      <P>The list's arrangement of order will affect the candidates'
chances of becoming a PFP-appointed legislator after the election for
legislators slated for Dec. 1.</P>
      <P>Another prominent nominee is former Vice Defense Minister Ku
Chung-lien, who was recently expelled from the opposition Kuomintang
for switching his allegiance to the PFP.</P>
      <P>Altogether, 41 legislators-at-large are expected to be produced
after the Dec. 1 election for the new legislature, which will have
225 seats, including four seats for aboriginal people and eight for
overseas Chinese representatives.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AIR FORCE CONTINUES SEARCH FOR MISSING F-5F FIGHTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taitung,  Taiwan,  Oct.  6  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Patrol boats and helicopters
continued searching off Taiwan's eastern coast Saturday for an F-5F
jet fighter which lost radio contact shortly after taking off from a
Republic of China Air Force base Friday.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for the Chih-Hang air base in the eastern county of
Taitung said two 600-ton coast guard patrol boats had been dispatched
to replace smaller ships in a search and rescue mission because bad
weather was hampering the smaller vessels.</P>
      <P>The twin-seater fighter jet took off from the air base Friday
afternoon and lost contact with the control tower at 3:08 p.m. An
AFGH press statement said the aircraft went missing 60 nautical miles
northeast of Taitung.</P>
      <P>"No trace of the jet or its two pilots has been discovered so
far," said Chang Ching-yuan, director of the political warfare
division at the Chih-Hang air base, some 300 km southeast of Taipei.</P>
      <P>Chang said an air force special investigative team had been
posted at the Chih-Hang air base to probe the cause of the accident.</P>
      <P>"Initial investigations show that the fighter might have
mistakenly entered an area of cloud cover while practicing a turn,"
Chang said.</P>
      <P>According to Chang, an accompanying F-5E jet fighter immediately
alerted the ill-fated plane upon noticing that it was veering into
the cloud cover.</P>
      <P>"The pilot aboard the F-5E heard a vague answer from the F-5F
which then disappeared from the air base's radar screen and lost
radio contact," Chang explained, adding that the altitude for
Friday's training flight was set at a range between 22,000 feet and
14,000 feet and that the cloud cover hovered around the 14,000-foot
level during the training time.</P>
      <P>Chang said it remains unclear why the missing plane had made a
wider-than-normal turn. "Mechanical failure, human error and
environmental problems are all likely causes," he noted, adding that
if the final response from the missing fighter can be decoded, the
reasons behind the deviation and disappearance of the plane can
probably be determined.</P>
      <P>Senior flight instructors said cloud cover is widely seen as
"off-limits" for fighter jets because pilots are prone to lose their
sense of direction in such circumstances.</P>
      <P>Military aircraft usually shun cloud cover except for certain
difficult training missions. Friday's training courses were mainly
for practicing equipment operations, including testing an
airborne-ground communication facility. Flight instructors said they
could not understand why the jet had strayed into the cloud.</P>
      <P>Air Force Commander-in-Chief Gen. Chen Chao-min and several other
senior officials at the Air Force General Headquarters (AFGH) flew to
the Chih-Hang air base Saturday to console and boost the morale of
all officers and men stationed there, as well as to probe the cause
of the accident.</P>
      <P>The missing pilots were identified as Maj. Lee Chih-min, 36, and
Capt. Kang Hung-chou, 31.</P>
      <P>Over 100 F-5E/Fs remain in service in the ROC Air Force.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN SUPPORTS U.S. ANTI-TERRORISM BUT LACKS CHANNELS: DPP OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New  York,  Oct.  5  (CNA)
(By Eric C.Y. Tseng and Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A visiting official of Taiwan's ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) said Friday that although Taiwan
is determined to support U.S. anti-terrorism work, it lacks the
channels through which it can participate in the emerging global
coalition of anti-terrorist nations.</P>
      <P>DPP International Affairs Department Director Tien Hsin said that
a "very special relationship" exists between Taiwan and the United
States, which he said is one of the reasons that Republic of China
Premier Chang Chun-hsiung voiced full support for Washington after
the terrorist attacks on America, despite a lack of formal diplomatic
ties between the two nations.</P>
      <P>Tien said that although it is difficult to predict the possible
repercussions that the terrorist attacks might have on Taipei-Beijing
relations, a consensus exists that Washington wants that relationship
to become even more stable to prevent the introduction of other
variables while the U.S. administration busies itself with the
establishment of an anti-terrorist coalition.</P>
      <P>Analysts in Taiwan have warned that the U.S. administration might
sacrifice Taiwan's interests to gain Beijing's support for its
anti-terrorist alliance, but U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell has
recently spoken out to quell such qualms.</P>
      <P>Tien said that since his arrival Wednesday in New York, he has
called on a number of prominent New York-based think tanks including
the National Committee on U.S.-China Relations, the National
Committee on American Foreign Policy and the Council on Foreign
Relations to exchange opinions on these issues.</P>
      <P>However, he continued, the future development of cross-Taiwan
Strait relations really depends on the results of the year-end
legislative elections in Taiwan, because Beijing is waiting to see
whether the DPP administration can acquire a stable grip on power.</P>
      <P>Tien said that he believes a possible opportunity for the
resumption of long-stalled cross-strait dialogue might present itself
after the elections.</P>
      <P>However, he added that some of the think tank experts to whom he
spoke expressed doubts that Taiwan will want to resume dialogue with
a high-profile mainland China at a time when the island is facing an
economic downturn, when public opinion in favor of unification with
mainland China is gradually gaining support, and when mainland
China's international image has been vastly improved by its
successful bid to host the 2008 Olympic Games.</P>
      <P>Tien is scheduled to leave for Washington Saturday to meet with
government officials and think tank experts there. He is slated to
visit Stanford University and the University of California at
Berkeley Oct. 14 and to return to Taiwan Oct. 18.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Highwire walker Jay Cochrane is set to
challenge his own world record for length of time living on the wire
in Taiwan's southern port city, Kaohsiung entertainment sources said
Saturday.</P>
      <P>Cochrane, who set a world record in 1981 by staying on a highwire
for 21 days in Puerto Rico, was scheduled later that day to climb
onto a 150-meter wire stretched between two 20-story steel towers in
downtown Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>At a pre-performance press conference, Cochrane, who successfully
completed a daring wire walk above Kaohsiung's landmark Love River
June 30 this year, said he is determined to stay on the wire for 22
days in this bid, which will be his last before retirement.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kaohsiung Mayor Lin Yung-chien, who was present at the
press conference, offered his blessing to Cochrane and wished him a
great success in his daring attempt.</P>
      <P>Cochrane, holder of five wire walking records, is expected to
live on the wire, with the tiny spaces on the steel towers at the two
ends of the wire offering constricted rest areas for him on a small
stool and a makeshift toilet.</P>
      <P>Without any shelter on the wire or on the tops of the steel
towers, Cochrane said he expects to remain awake throughout the 22
days, adding that the first six to seven days will be the most
challenging for him and that he will feel more comfortable after that
period.</P>
      <P>Cochrane will take extra clothes to keep himself warm in the much
lower temperatures expected on the wire, as well as some medicine,
including antibiotics, in case he falls ill.</P>
      <P>People who are interested in watching Cochrane's show will be
able to buy admission tickets priced at NT$200 and NT$100, the
sources said.</P>

      <P>In line with the government's reconstruction work after the

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN CONSUMERS URGED TO USE `PLASTIC CURRENCY' MORE OFTEN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 6 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan consumers were urged Saturday to use
"plastic currency" more often amid outrage against increasingly
rampant currency counterfeiting.</P>
      <P>Chen Chi-chu, acting president of the International Commercial
Bank of China, said that only in a cashless society can currency
forgery be completely extinguished.</P>
      <P>He suggested that the government help convert the entire payment
market in Taiwan to a system using IC cards rather than paper and
metal currency, enabling banks to issue electronic IC cards for
consumers, who will in turn make their spending completely
electronic.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Wu Shao-chi, director of the Issue Department of the
Central Bank of China (CBC), disagreed that currency forgery is so
rampant that it is threatening to disrupt domestic financial
stability.</P>
      <P>Wu declined to confirm rumors that as many as 60 fake bills per
day, with a total accumulated face value of NT$8 million
(US$231,884), have been received by dealers at the Huan Nan Fruit and
Vegetable Market in Taipei, but he admitted that it is hard to
calculate the losses.</P>
      <P>He added that the CBC will not consider changing its current
minting process before better anti-counterfeiting measures are
developed.</P>
      <P>On Thursday, the same day that a special government task force
was assembled to fight recent high-profile currency counterfeiting
cases, an operation was discovered in southern Taiwan that was
minting phony coins, police said Friday.</P>
      <P>Justice Minister Chen Ding-nan announced recently that those
convicted of forging Taiwan currency would face stiffer penalties in
the future. The maximum penalty for currency forgery is death, he
added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PEOPLE FIRST PARTY ANNOUNCES LIST OF LEGISLATOR-AT-LARGE NOMINEES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  6  (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition People First Party (PFP) Vice
Chairman Chang Chau-hsiung said Saturday that PFP Chairman James
Soong is not on the list of candidates that the party has nominated
for potential legislators-at-large because Soong should be leading
the team from a "high vantage point."</P>
      <P>Chang said at a news conference to announce the list of nominees
that although both pros and cons exist in the debate for Soong's
inclusion on the list, the party decided in the end that the popular
former Taiwan provincial governor's talents lie in administration and
would probably be less-suited to the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Chang said that the first three nominees on the list of 26
candidates have strong financial backgrounds because of the party's
determination to establish a "shadow Cabinet" on financial policies.</P>
      <P>The three scholars will also be able to fill in any gaps in
financial expertise left by other legislators elected from regional
constituencies, he added.</P>
      <P>The list's arrangement of order indicates the party's order of
preference and will therefore affect the candidates' chances of
becoming PFP-appointed legislators after the Dec. 1 elections.</P>
      <P>In the order of their nomination, the top PFP legislator-at-large
candidates are National Taiwan University finance professor Christina
Y. Liu, daughter of former Finance Minister Shirley Kuo; National
Chengchi University (NCCU) finance professor Norman Yin; and NCCU
finance department director Lee Tung-hau.</P>
      <P>Together with fifth-ranking Chinese Federation of Labor President
Lin Hui-kuan and 10th-ranking Namchow Chemical Chairman Alfred F.L.
Chen, half of the top-10 ranking PFP nominees had represented the PFP
in the high-profile presidential Economic Development Advisory
Conference held in August.</P>
      <P>Lin had previously turned down a recommendation from the
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) to be included on its
legislators-at-large nomination list.</P>
      <P>Another prominent nominee, ranked sixth on the list, is former
Vice Defense Minister Ku Chung-lien, who was recently expelled from
the KMT for switching his allegiance to the PFP.</P>
      <P>Rounding out the top-10 list are former Legislative Yuan
President Liu Sung-pan at No. 4, PFP Secretary-General David J.C.
Chung at No. 7, aboriginal legislator Tsau Chung-han and noted
neurologist Kao Ming-chien.</P>
      <P>Altogether, a total of 41 legislators-at-large are expected to be
produced after the Dec. 1 election for the new legislature, which
will have 225 seats.</P>
      <P>In addition to the 41 legislators-at-large, eight other seats are
reserved for overseas Chinese representatives who will be elected
according to the same formula for proportional representation among
political parties.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's divorce rate hit a new single-month
high in August this year, with one out of every 2.9 couples ending
their relationship with divorce, a lawmaker said Saturday.</P>
      <P>In line with record-high unemployment, Taiwan's divorce rate also
shot up to a new high in recent months, according to Legislator Hsieh
Chang-chieh, a People First Party (PFP) representative from Changhua

2.9 married couples in Taiwan ended their relationship with divorce
between January and September this year, he added.</P>
      <P>The new record, compared with one in every 3.5 couples in 2000,

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  6  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition New Party (NP) legislative
caucus ridiculed Premier Chang Chun-hsiung's administrative team as a
"pathetic Cabinet" Saturday, saying its overall performance over the
past year is far from ideal.</P>
      <P>Ying Chih-hung, convener of the NP caucus, made the remarks at a
news conference held in connection with the first anniversary of
Chang's premiership.</P>
      <P>However, Ying went on to express sympathy for Chang because, he
said, the premier has been very diligent.</P>
      <P>"Nevertheless, his Cabinet's performance is really mediocre,"
Ying claimed. "All major economic indicators point to continued
deterioration of our economic situation over the past year."</P>
      <P>In his view, Ying went on, Chang did not have full authority to
make decisions on major policy issues or on the Cabinet's lineup and
agenda.</P>
      <P>"Chang is only President Chen Shui-bian's chief of the general
staff, not a true policy-maker," Ying said, adding that Chang's
plight has been aggravated by the fact that some Cabinet members
appointed by Chen have failed to cooperate fully with him.</P>
      <P>As a result, Ying said, the Cabinet has performed dismally. "Over
the past year, we have seen many policy turn-abouts, inconsistencies
and operational flaws and flops," he alleged.</P>
      <P>For instance, Ying continued, the Cabinet's measures to salvage
the faltering domestic economy have so far failed to achieve ideal
results as the domestic unemployment rate has surged to an all-time
high and industrial production and exports have continued to register
negative growth.</P>
      <P>"My observation is that the overall performance of Chang's
Cabinet deserves a score of only 30 points on a `0-100' scale," Ying
added.</P>
      <P>NP Legislator Lai Shyh-bao echoed Ying's view, saying the
current Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)-led Cabinet has failed to
delivered on its promise to rev up the domestic economy and improve
the people's livelihood.</P>
      <P>Lai said he recognizes Premier Chang's devotion and diligence.
"But the cold reality is that his Cabinet has accomplished few
achievements," he said, adding that Taiwan's "misery index" has
reached a record high.</P>
      <P>Quoting official tallies, Lai said, the country's composite
economic indicator has continued flashing a gloomy "blue light"
since last December.</P>
      <P>Lai said Taiwan's per capita gross national product (GNP) is
expected to drop to US$13,144 this year from 2000's US$14,188, and
that the island's total industrial production will decrease by an
estimated NT$123.3 billion (US$3.58 billion) this year.</P>
      <P>Worse yet, Lai said the island's private investment and foreign
trade have all declined this year as compared with the 2000 levels.
While the unemployment rate rose from last December's 3.16 percent
to 5.17 percent in August this year, Lai said, the market
capitalization of local stocks has also shrunk by more than NT$1.6
trillion over the past year.</P>

      <P>Hashimoto, one of 12 Japanese ALS patients who are currently on a
four-day goodwill visit to Taiwan, made the remarks while meeting
with local ALS sufferers.</P>
      <P>"We made extensive plans and preparations for our unprecedented
trip to Taiwan," Hashimoto said, adding that she hopes the trip will
help boost exchanges of life experiences with their local
counterparts.</P>
      <P>Hsu Tsui-lieh, a physician who concurrently serves as president
of the Taiwan ALS Patients Association, noted that there is no cure
for Lou Gehrig's disease at the moment. "We can only control the
development of the disease," he said, adding that ALS patients need
long-term care and spiritual support.</P>
      <P>Hsu said he has invited Japanese ALS patients to visit Taiwan
with a view to allowing local patients to learn from their foreign
counterparts' experiences in overcoming their difficulties.</P>
      <P>"We also hope that the government and the private sector can
make concerted efforts to create a better living environment for
local ALS patients," he added.</P>

(By David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Republic of China President Lee
Teng-hui stumped for two Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) candidates
Saturday for the year-end legislative and local elections.</P>
      <P>Lee stumped for Liao Pen-yen and Lee Jih-huang, the TSU-nominated
candidates running for legislators, at the inauguration of their
respective campaign headquarters in Taipei County.</P>
      <P>Accompanied by TSU Chairman Huang Chu-wen and Secretary General
Su Chin-chiang, Lee arrived at the campaign headquarters of Liao
Pen-yen at noon and was warmly welcomed. He later proceeded to Lee
Jih-huang's campaign headquarters and was also warmly received.</P>
      <P>In the stump speech, Lee said that it was the hope that Taiwan
maintains a stable political situation that made him, an 80-year-old
man, stump for TSU candidates. Lee is not a TSU member but the TSU, a
newly formed political party, ragards him as its spiritual leader.</P>
      <P>Lee urged the public to support Liao Peng-yen and Lee Jih-huang,
and hoped that the two would exercise interpellation rights at
the legislature to promote Taiwan's economy if they are elected
legislators.</P>
      <P>As for the economic slowdown, Lee said that he has a set of
solutions that will surely prop up Taiwan's stock market to reach
the 8,000-point level and lower the unemployment rate to three
percent through the solution of bank bad debts and the investment in
government bonds.</P>
      <P>Lee was former chairman of the opposition Kuomintang. He was
forced to step down as KMT chairman after the 107-year-old party was
humiliatingly defeated in the 2000 presidential election.</P>
      <P>The KMT revoked Lee's membership Sept. 21 for his harsh
criticism toward the party and stumping for rival TSU that resulted
in widespread protests from KMT members.</P>

      <P>W.Y. Pan, president of the state-run Chinese
Petroleum Corp. (CPC), will leave for Beijing next Monday to study
the possibility of making joint oil exploration at Daqing oil field
with mainland China.</P>
      <P>If the result is affirmative, mainland China will become another
source of crude imports for Taiwan. At present, CPC's crude imports
are mainly from the Middle East, Indonesia, Australia and Africa.</P>
      <P>During the Beijing trip, Pan will first sign a letter of intent
for selling diesel to China National Petroleum Corp.</P>
      <P>Mainland China now still forbids imports of diesel, but the ban
is expected to be relaxed after the mainland and Taiwan become full
members of the World Trade Organization early next year.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Executive Yuan (Cabinet) and Ministry of Economic
Affairs have agreed to CPC's plan to sell diesel to mainland China.</P>
      <P>After his business talks in Beijing, Pan will proceed to
Heilongjiang Province in northeastern China to visit Daqing oil field,
the largest oil oil field in mainland China with a daily output of 1.2
million barrels.</P>
      <P>If the mainland side agrees to sell oil to CPC, it will be
another deal between mainland China and a state-run company of
Taiwan. Taiwan Power Company has concluded a deal to import coal from
the mainland.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, CPC's plan to conduct joint oil exploration at the
outlet of the Zhujiang River in southern China with mainland China is
still waiting for the approval from the Cabinet-level Mainland China
Affairs. Therefore, it will not be taken up for discussion during

    <HEADLINE>OVER HALF OF PEOPLE 'SATISFIED' WITH PRESIDENT'S OVERALL PERFORMANCE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  7 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Nearly 53 percent of those questioned in a
recent survey released Sunday are satisfied with the overall
performance of President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>The survey by Focus Survey Research Corp. was conducted Oct. 4-5
by telephone and received 1,033 valid responses from random
respondents over the age of 20 around the island. The margin of error
was 3.05 percent.</P>
      <P>The survey found that 9.5 percent of those responding were "very
satisfied," and 43 percent were "satisfied" with Chen's overall
performance. Just over 22.7 percent said they were "not satisfied"
with the president, and 9.5 percent said they were "not at all
satisfied" with Chen's overall performance.</P>
      <P>Chuang Kuo-jung, assistant professor from National Cheng Chi
University, said the figures show that those who are satisfied with
Chen outnumber those who are not satisfied with him.</P>
      <P>The survey also showed that President Chen had higher approval
ratings than other political figures, namely Lien Chan, chairman of
the opposition Kuomintang; James Soong, chairman of the People First
Party; and Lee Teng-hui, former president of the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>About 34 percent said they like Chen, followed by 20 percent who
favor Soong, 18.8 percent for Lee, and 10 percent for Lien.</P>
      <P>On the opposite side, 19.5 percent said they dislike Chen, 54
percent dislike Lien, 39.5 dislike Soong, and 49.3 percent do not
care for Lee.</P>
      <P>Commentator Ping Lu said the high disapproval rate for Lien could
be because of the KMT's recent move to revoke the party membership of
Lee, who also served as KMT chairman during his 12 years as ROC
president. Lee was ousted because he had recently criticized the KMT
and for stumping for the recently created political party, the Taiwan

    <HEADLINE>TAIPEI CITY MAYOR RECOMMENDS SUBMARINE-STYLE PUMPING STATIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  7 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei City Mayor Ma Ying-jeou said Sunday
that pumping stations should be made as a water-tight as submarines
to ensure they do not fail during flooding.</P>
      <P>At a symposium on ways to prevent flooding and prevent
disasters, Ma said Taipei's Yucheng pumping station -- the largest in
Southeast Asia -- broke down during the height of Typhoon Nari
because the facility itself was deluged by floodwaters.</P>
      <P>Although the station can pump water equivalent to that in a
standard swimming pool in just eight second, it was rendered useless
during the typhoon which hit northern Taipei Sept. 16 and dumped
nearly a meter of rain in 24 hours.</P>
      <P>The computer-controlled pumping station stopped operating
automatically when water flooded its cooling system.</P>
      <P>Saying that constructing a wall around the station as a
breakwater cannot guarantee that the station will remain dry during
emergencies, Ma suggested wrapping the station in a water-proof
shell, making the whole station resemble a submarine.</P>
      <P>The breakdown of the Yucheng pumping station was partially blamed
for the unprecedented flooding in downtown Taipei. More than 5,000
basements were deluged by floodwaters.</P>
      <P>He also suggested that the government revise existing rules to
demand that electrical fuse boxes are moved out of basements, as is
currently the case in most large buildings. During Typhoon Nari,
hundreds of buildings went dark after floodwaters shorted out the
entire structure because of flooding in only the basement. Water was
also cut because most buildings in Taipei rely on ground floor or
basement pumps to deliver water to upper floors of high-rises.</P>
      <P>Taiwan County Magistrate Su Tseng-chang agreed at the symposium
with Ma's idea of submarine-style pumping stations, saying that the
breakdown of the pumping station in Tucheng, Taipei County during
Typhoon Nari aggravated the flooding in surrounding areas.</P>
      <P>As a result, Su said, rainfall brought by Typhoon Nari inundated
nine times more households and generated 30 times more water-damaged
rubbish than did Typhoon Xangsane which struck the island on Oct. 30
last year.</P>
      <P>In a related development, Ma announced earlier in the day that
Taipei's rapid transit system will shorten the interval between
trains from 15 minutes to 10 minutes on three of its five lines.</P>
      <P>From 6 a.m. Sunday, Ma said, trains will run every 10 minutes on
the Hsintien, Tamshui and Chungho lines.</P>
      <P>The system, which transports an estimated 600,000 people each
day, was partially paralyzed after Typhoon Nari flooded its
underground tracks. Commuters, forced to seek alternative
transportation to and from work, reduced the city's road traffic to a
near standstill.</P>
      <P>Service on the full lines of Hsintien and Tamsui was only
restored last week, but the system's hub, Taipei Main Station, is
still closed because of more serious water damage. Trains that
usually stop at the station are now passing through without stopping.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ENERGY EXPERT RECOMMENDS NUCLEAR POWER FOR TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New  York, Oct. 6 (CNA)
(By Jennifer Huang and Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan should seek to diversify the forms
of its energy sources in case of a crisis and nuclear power is the
most available for the country at present, a renowned expert based in
the United States said Saturday in New York.</P>
      <P>Hsu Yi-yun, who served as chairman of the Republic of China's
Atomic Energy Commission during 1990-1996, urged authorities in
Taiwan to remain on high alert should Taiwan's importation of energy
be cut by an unpredictable crisis in the international community. He
stressed that nuclear power is the energy form which meets Taiwan's
needs the most now because of its cheap cost and security.</P>
      <P>Hsu made the remarks while giving a keynote speech on the energy
prospects in Taiwan and mainland China at an annual gathering of the
New York branch of the American Association of Chinese Engineers.
More than 100 academics and specialists from the telecommunications,
Internet and medical sectors from Taiwan, Hong Kong and mainland
China took part in the event.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that Taiwan's energy reserves could last for two
months if its import channels were blocked by outside factors, such
as a blockade by mainland China or a major crisis in the Middle East,
Hsu said the country could face blackouts soon after such a crisis.</P>
      <P>The energy expert said that Taiwan should further diversify its
sources of imported energy and that the ROC government should fully
promote the use of nuclear power.</P>
      <P>In contrast, the situation in mainland China would not be so
difficult in the face of such an international crisis because the
authorities there have actively built power plants in an ambitious
"self-sufficiency" plan, he noted, adding that the mainland should
take measures to avoid problems related to greenhouse gases, acid
rain and smog.</P>
      <P>Hsu also criticized the decision made by the current government
led by the Democratic Progressive Party to suspend the building of
Taiwan's Fourth Nuclear Power Plant in Oct. 2000. Although
construction has been resumed, he said that Taiwan's international
credibility had been seriously damaged.</P>

      <P>Sixty-one percent of respondents in a recent
survey said they are either "very satisfied" or "satisfied" with
Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou's handling of the disaster caused by
Typhoon Nari.</P>
      <P>The survey, released Sunday by the Focus Survey Research
Corporation, also found that the people who said their impression of
the mayor was negatively affected by his performance during and after
the typhoon was far higher than those who said their impression was
positively affected, 12.4 percent to 7.4 percent.</P>
      <P>Just over 68 percent said they have not changed their view of the
mayor because of his performance during and after the disaster.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, 28.5 percent said they either "strongly
agreed" or "agreed to some extent" with the expression that "Ma's
risk-management capabilities are insufficient."</P>
      <P>Citing the figure as a proof of Ma's weakness, Tuan Yi-kang, a
Taipei City Councilman from the Democratic Progressive Party warned
in a news conference called to release the survey Sunday that the
writing is on the wall for Ma.</P>
      <P>The mayor will face an uphill battle for reelection if he fails
to head off the increasing number of unsatisfied people, Tuan said.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted between Oct. 4-5 and received 1,033
valid responses from those over age 20 in Taipei City. The survey had
a margin of error of 3.05 percent.</P>
      <P>Typhoon Nari, which struck northern Taiwan Sept. 16 and central
Taiwan Sept. 17, has claimed the lives of 83, and dumped nearly one
meter of rainfall within 24 hours in mountainous areas.</P>
      <P>The torrential rain deluged many low-lying areas. Taipei was the
hardest-hit area, 51 percent of its inhabitants were affected by the
storm and 26 percent in the whole of Taiwan, according to the survey.</P>
      <P>About 5,000 buildings in Taipei had their basements inundated by
floodwaters, and the city's rapid transit system was paralyzed after
its underground tracks were turned into underground streams.</P>
      <P>The city has not yet full recovered from the disaster, as its

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 7 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Kuomintang said in an open letter Sunday
that Lee Teng-hui, former ROC president and former KMT chairman, has
"bitten the hand that feeds him," and that it had to take the
"painful decision" to expel him Sept. 21.</P>
      <P>The letter, issued by the KMT Central Committee to all its
members, noted that Lee could have used his respected status to help
bridge the differences between the ruling and the opposition camps.
This, the letter said, would have not only contributed to the nation,
but would have left Lee's mark on history.</P>
      <P>Instead, the letter said, Lee tried to splinter the KMT by
criticizing the party that nurtured him and using a facade of wanting
to help stabilize politics at the same time.</P>
      <P>The letter noted that Lee, who taught agricultural economics at
National Taiwan University before he stepped into politics, has
benefited a great deal from the KMT.</P>
      <P>It said, "Lee, as a scholar, reached the peak of his political
career in the short time of little more than two decades under the
tutelage of late President Chiang Ching-kuo. It is obvious that Lee
could not have reached such a high position without the nurturing of
the KMT.</P>
      <P>"Furthermore, during Lee's term as the nation's president and KMT
chairman, many of his ideas on reforms were able to become reality
because the KMT was the ruling party at the time."</P>
      <P>But the letter said that Lee has "bitten the hand that feed him."
It noted that Lee has stepped up his tirades against the KMT,
seriously damaging the KMT's reputation. Recently, Lee has openly
stumped for the candidates of another political party. "The party has
to seriously address his words and deeds," the letter said.</P>
      <P>The letter also pointed out the stark difference between Lee
before and after stepping down as party chairman, noting that Lee
said on the 105th anniversary of the KMT that "the party is our
mother, and we are brethren. If we can achieve something one day, we
have to be thankful to the nurturing of the mother and support of the
brethren." But in no time, Lee turned his back against the "mother,"
and the "brethren," the letter added.</P>
      <P>Lee, who had earlier said that couldn't care less about being
expelled from the party and that he had been rubbing shoulders with a
"bunch of rascals" during his 12 years as the KMT head, said Saturday
that democracy is respecting the wishes of the majority of the
people.</P>
      <P>But Lee, in stumping for the candidates of the Taiwan Solidarity
Union, said that after President Chen Shui-bian took over the helm of
the nation from the KMT in May 2000, the political situation has been
less than stable, which he said, without mentioning the name of KMT
Chairman Lien Chan, is because of "a man's lack of democratic spirit,
even if he is a Ph.D. holder in political science."</P>
      <P>Lien is the only one in such a position to have received such a
degree.</P>

      <P>Chinese Culture University, which has prided

      <P>Christelijke Hogeschool Noord-Nederland has become the 59th

      <P>Candidacy registration for the Dec. 1
elections for local government chiefs and legislators started Sunday,
the formal step that raises the curtain on the races.</P>
      <P>Although eight political movements have received application
forms, only a few would-be candidates went through the process
Sunday, because the date was considered "ominous" according to
traditional Chinese custom.</P>
      <P>Many would-be candidates opted to canvass votes rather than
securing their candidacy Sunday.</P>
      <P>The registration period will last through Oct. 11, during which
all registration offices will remain open on holidays, according to
officials from the Central Election Commission (CEC).</P>
      <P>Those who intend to run for regional and aboriginal legislative
seats, city mayorship and county magistrate posts should register
their candidacy with election commissions of special municipalities,
cities and counties around the country.</P>
      <P>Hopefuls for at-large and overseas Chinese community legislative
seats must register at the CEC.</P>
      <P>All candidates will draw lots at various registration offices on
Nov. 12 to determine their numbers that will appear on the ballots.</P>
      <P>The CEC is scheduled to unveil the rosters of candidates for
various elections and the official campaign period on Nov. 20. The
commission is also expected to announce the number of eligible voters
for each kind of election on Nov. 27.</P>

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Despite the disruptions by the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks in the United States and by the typhoons which
swept through Taiwan last month, major local notebook makers
registered growth in their output in September.</P>
      <P>The four leading notebook computer firms -- Quanta Computer,
Arima Computer, Compal Electronic and Inventec Cooperation -- were
estimated to put out a total of 760,000 units in September, up 12.6
percent from August, after international air traffic got back to
normal over the past two weeks, according to initial estimates.</P>
      <P>Quanta -- Taiwan's largest notebook manufacturer -- produced
380,000 units in September, a similar level to its August production
which was near full capacity of 400,000 units per month.</P>
      <P>Compal Electronic, which is a major contractor for the U.S.-based
Dell, produced a historic single-month high of 220,000 units last
month, up 33.3 percent over the August level. Compal said its
third-quarter production hit 560,000 units, a 12-percent increase
over the second quarter.</P>
      <P>Arima Computer, a prime contractor for the U.S.-based Compaq,
made 600,000 to 700,000 units in September, about its August level.
Arima was the sole major notebook maker which failed to post an
increase in output for September.</P>
      <P>Inventec Cooperation estimated its September production at
100,000 units, up 40 percent over its August output. The company
attributed the growth to rising demand from Europe following its
holiday season and from the United States after the Sept. 11
disaster.</P>
      <P>Quanta and Compal have predicted that their output will continue
to grow in October, with Quanta and Compal confident of netting a
monthly business revenue of over the NT$10 billion mark and the NT$8
billion mark, respectively.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC GOVERNMENT URGED TO FURTHER OPEN MARKET TO SERVICE INDUSTRY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  7  (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Some foreign trade associations have
recently urged the Republic of China government to further open its
service industry to foreign participants, since such a move would
help improve the standard of living on Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has promised that it will open the market to some specific
service sectors after it joins the World Trade Organization (WTO).
These sectors, which will include telecommunications services,
transportation, construction, sales, education, environment
protection, finance, health, tourism, entertainment, and cultural and
sports services have been either prohibited from foreign investment
or have faced entry barriers.</P>
      <P>Doubting to what extent the ROC government can open its market to
the service industry, some senior officials of trade associations,
including the American Chamber of Commerce in Taipei (AmCham) and the
European Council of Commerce and Trade (ECCT), urged the ROC
government to recognize the fact that the final beneficiary of the
opening of Taiwan's service industry will be its people, while
over-protection of its specific industries will violate the spirit of
liberalization.</P>
      <P>AmCham President Richard Henson said that Taiwan's service
industry has been protected too much and that that has made their
enterprises less competitive, citing the example of frequent bridge
failures throughout Taiwan and the recent heavy flooding caused by
typhoons.</P>
      <P>Henson went on to say that because local constructors have been
overprotected by the government, foreign companies have no other way
but to chose to leave the Taiwan market. Without outside competition,
Taiwan's construction quality cannot be elevated, and the victims
will be the people of Taiwan, Henson said.</P>
      <P>He stressed that the opening of the market to the service
industry is a precondition for Taiwan to become a global planning and
management center.</P>
      <P>Theo Stiftl, CEO of ECCT, said he was quite surprised that the
reconstruction works of many schools ruined in the devastating
earthquake in September 1999 still have not been completed, and that
the complicated problems involved need the further attention of the
government.</P>
      <P>Stiftl said that refusing the participation of the foreign
service sector will benefit only a few special interest groups or
individuals.</P>
      <P>He stressed that Taiwan will open its service market sooner or
later after it enters the WTO, and if local entrepreneurs still do
not want to dedicate time to strengthening competitiveness and
reducing costs, the pressure of competition on the island will be
clear in time.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  7 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The country's two major opposition parties
joined hands Sunday to side against President Chen Shui-bian and his
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) for blaming the
opposition-controlled legislature for the nation's political
deadlock.</P>
      <P>Lin Fong-cheng, secretary-general of the leading opposition
Kuomintang (KMT), said if his party is to be blamed, it is only
because it is too subservient to the ruling party in the legislature.</P>
      <P>Noting that the second and third Legislative Yuan passed 23 bills
and 44 bills on average per session respectively when the DPP was the
opposition party, while the fourth Legislative Yuan has seen through
63 bills per session on average when the KMT was the opposition, Lin
said. He said that this betrays the president's claim that the
legislature is paralyzed under the control of the KMT and has become
a ball and chain around the nation.</P>
      <P>He also pointed out that the government's overall budget for 2001
has been cut 2.03 percent by the legislature, which is smaller than
the 3.8 percent cut in 1994 when President Chen served as the DPP
whip at the Legislative Yuan, and the 1995 cut while Premier Chang
Chun-hsiung was the DPP whip.</P>
      <P>This bears out the fact that the KMT has been too accommodating
to the government and "still does not know how to serve as an
opposition party," Lin said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chou Hsi-wei, the whip of another opposition party,
the People First Party, also disputed the DPP leaders' claims, saying
that members from his party were skeptical about many of the
government's economic policies but have yielded their own opinions to
rally behind the Cabinet in hopes of boosting the country's economy.</P>
      <P>The DPP's blame will only force his party to review its
cooperative attitude with the DPP in the next legislative session,
Chou said.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a campaign rally in Taichung Saturday, President Chen
and Premier Chang took turns in lambasting the opposition for what
they called its blocking of the administration's policy at every
turn.</P>
      <P>They blamed the opposition-controlled legislature as the root
cause of the country's current political unrest and appealed to their
supporters to return DPP candidates to the legislature.</P>

      <P>The joint military actions against
Afghanistan by the United States and Britain will bring about
negative impact on Taiwan's foreign trade, the island's top trade
promoter said Monday.</P>
      <P>Huang Chih-peng, secretary general of the China External Trade

      <P>Nearly four weeks after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in New

Osama bin Laden's al-Qaeda network remain unclear, local people

      <P>"We should also evaluate how the Taiwan economy would be
affected if the world economy continues deteriorating after the U.S.

      <P>Commenting on the latest U.S. military response, Lin Yu-fang, a

Policy" toward China.

1858: The "Arrow Incident" occurs, in which a Hong
Kong-registered ship, the Arrow, is searched in Kwantung by Ching

of the Japanese.

1897: Dow Jones &amp; Co., Inc., a New York news agency, comes up

stocks and bonds on Wall Street. The agency computes a daily
industrial average by using a list of 12 stocks and dividing their
total price by 12.

1912: Montenegro declares war on Turkey, starting the first
Balkan War.

    <HEADLINE>OIL PRICES WON'T INCREASE FOR TIME BEING: ECONOMICS MINISTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 8 (CNA)
(By Lilian WU)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs Lin Hsin-yi
said Monday that domestic petroleum prices will not be raised for the
time being and that water and electricity prices will not be
increased before the end of the year.</P>
      <P>Lin made the remarks in the wake of the U.S. and British
military strikes on Afghanistan early Monday morning for harboring
Osama bin Laden, the prime suspect in the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks
in the United States.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's two main oil suppliers, Chinese Petroleum Corp. (CPC)
and Formosa Plastic Group (FPG), have said that they have safety
reserves of 110 days and 60 days worth of oil, respectively, which
should ensure an ample supply for domestic consumption.</P>
      <P>Both the CPC and the FPG have also tried to increase oil purchase
from Indonesia, Malaysia, Australia and Africa in order to diversity
the sources of their oil supply.</P>
      <P>CPC executives said the impact on Taiwan of the military conflict
will depend on the scale and duration of the conflict, adding that if
it does expand to the region's oil fields or to crude oil transport
routes, the impact on oil prices will be limited.</P>
      <P>In addition, Saudi Arabia recently assured the CPC that it will
faithfully uphold its terms of the contract with the company and
that the supply of oil will not be disrupted.</P>
      <P>The situation in the Middle East has a great impact on the
stability of Taiwan's supply of oil because the CPC imports 58
percent of its supply from oil-producing countries in the region.</P>
      <P>The CPC also imports 25 percent of its oil from Africa and 10
percent from Indonesia and Australia. To avoid the possible negative
effects of the military conflict and its aftermath on Taiwan's supply
of oil, the CPC has recently consulted oil-producing countries in
Asia and Africa in the hopes of increasing its short-term purchases
of crude oil from the regions.</P>
      <P>The FPG said that it imports its oil from Malaysia, Indonesia,
West Africa and North Africa, adding that its oil supply is stable.
As to whether FPG will raise prices, FPG officials said that they
will have to closely watch the situation in the Middle East and the
fluctuations in world oil prices.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, law enforcement authorities have stepped up security
at Kaohsiung Harbor in southern Taiwan as well as at the CPC's
refineries and storage facilities in Kaohsiung.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC HAS HAMMERED OUT MEASURES TO COPE WITH U.S. STRIKE FALLOUT: CHEN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  8  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Monday the
Republic of China government has hammered out 55 measures to cope
with the possible fallout from the latest U.S.-led night strikes
against Afghanistan.</P>
      <P>President Chen made the remarks in a special televised speech
delivered after huddling with security chiefs in an emergency meeting
at 8 a.m.</P>
      <P>Chen called on the people of Taiwan to remain calm and keep
confidence in the government's ability to handle any possible
contingencies.</P>
      <P>In his address, the president reaffirmed the ROC's full support
for the U.S.-led war on terrorism, offering access to Taiwan's
airspace as well as humanitarian aid to Afghan refugees.</P>
      <P>"I would like to take this opportunity to express my country's
rejection of violence and terrorism and express full support for the
United States' methods and determination in striking against
terrorism," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Besides expressing concern for the aid needed for resettling
Afghan refugees, Chen said, the ROC is willing to provide timely
assistance.</P>
      <P>Chen further said he has placed the ROC military on higher alert
against possible "terrorist" action, and has ordered the Ministry of
National Defense to monitor movements in mainland China -- the
greatest security threat to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen also said if necessary, the national security fund will
intervene in the local stock market to help maintain domestic capital
market order and financial stability.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the legislative caucus of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) suggested that the Cabinet form a special
financial task force to cope with the possible impact on the Taiwan
economy of the ongoing U.S. retaliation for the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks that leveled New York City's World Trade
Center and left the Pentagon in flames.</P>
      <P>Opposition New Party Legislator Lai Shyh-bao said if the current
U.S.-led war on terrorism continues, Taiwan's export-driven economy
would be seriously affected.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, Lai said, the National Security Council
should form an economic division to craft effective measures to cope
with changing world financial and economic situation.</P>
      <P>Several opposition Kuomintang legislators also expressed worries
about the possible fallout on the Taiwan economy, which is already
in recession. They also reminded the government to keep track of
developments in the delicate Taipei-Washington-Beijing relations in
the wake of the U.S. anti-terrorism strikes.</P>
      <P>Fielding questions at a Legislative Yuan committee meeting,
Minister of Transportation and Communications Yeh Chu-lan said
the Civil Aeronautics Administration and other relevant agencies
have stepped up security measures at major airports and harbors
around the island since Sept. 11.</P>
      <P>Touching on the government's 30-day guarantee for extra
third-party liability insurance coverage for local airlines, Yeh said
her ministry will adopt necessary measures if local carriers fail to
strike new deals with their insurers before the deadline expires.</P>
      <P>In reaction to the onset of the U.S. air strikes against
military targets of Afghanistan's Taliban regime and terrorist
training camps in that country, the Ministry of Justice Investigation
Bureau ordered all MJIB offices to tighten alert to maintain
domestic stability and security.</P>
      <P>The National Police Administration also directed police officers
to intensify patrols of foreign embassies and representative offices
and strengthen protection of foreign expatriates in Taiwan,
particularly American and Israeli citizens.</P>
      <P>Police sources said security measures at the U.S. and
Israeli representative offices have been fortified since last
month. The American Institute in Taiwan, which represents U.S.
interests in the ROC in the absence of formal diplomatic ties,
suspended its visa services Monday.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Central Bank of China (CBC) said it will do its
utmost to maintain stability of the domestic financial markets,
including the exchange rate of the New Taiwan dollar against the U.S.
greenback.</P>
      <P>CBC officials said the central bank now has US$10 billion, 15
billion euro and 1 billion Japanese yen in hand to accommodate the
domestic need for foreign currencies.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC READY TO OFFER ANY HELP THAT U.S. MAY NEED: PRESIDENT CHEN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 8 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China is ready to offer any
help that the United States may require as the U.S.-led coalition
began military strikes on the Taliban regime in Afghanistan early
Monday, President Chen Shui-bian said.</P>
      <P>Addressing a national security meeting that he chaired at 8 a.m.
Monday, President Chen voiced strong support for the U.S. military
actions against Osama bin Laden, the prime suspect in the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks in the United States, the al Qaeda, bin Laden's
terrorist network, and the Taliban militia, bin Laden's host.</P>
      <P>Chen said Taiwan is willing to offer the United States any
necessary assistance and to throw its full support behind the
anti-terrorism treaties and resolutions passed by the United Nations.</P>
      <P>He added that Taiwan would like to offer help to the U.S.-led
coalition operations in areas including allowing coalition aircraft
to use ROC airspace and providing assistance regarding refugee
resettlement.</P>
      <P>The president, meanwhile, called for the nation to remain calm
and composed in the face of the U.S. actions against Afghanistan. He
added that a total of 55 contingency measures involving national
security, finance and economics, and transportation issues have been
mapped out by the various divisions of the government to cope with
the situation.</P>
      <P>Chen said he was notified by the National Security Council and
the National Security Bureau within the first minute of the launch of
the U.S.-led coalition military strikes against Afghanistan, adding
that he immediately instructed the Executive Yuan to hold an
emergency national security conference first thing in the morning,
which set the national contingency mechanism in motion.</P>
      <P>He stressed that it is his responsibility to take the opportunity
to make known the Republic of China's firm stance against violence
and global terrorism.</P>
      <P>Noting that the just-initiated U.S.-led military action has been
taken to safeguard freedom and stamp out threats of terrorism rather
than to retaliate against Afghanistan, Chen said he is determined to
express support for the military action on behalf of the ROC
government and people.</P>
      <P>Chen instructed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to remain in
close contact with U.S. authorities in efforts to convey Taiwan's
support and intentions to assist the United States in the wake of the
military strikes.</P>
      <P>He instructed that the National Stability Fund be ready to be
used at any minute to help stabilize the domestic stock market,
supplies of commodity goods and the island's foreign trade.</P>
      <P>He also instructed the Ministry of National Defense and the
Mainland Affairs Council to remain on high alert against any possible
changes in the situation in the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu and Premier Chang Chun-hsiung were
present at the emergency national security meeting.</P>
      <P>Other ranking officials who were summoned to the meeting included
Presidential Secretary-General Yu Shyi-kun, Vice Premier Lai In-jaw,
National Defense Minister Wu Shih-wen, Foreign Affairs Minister Tien
Hung-mao, Justice Minister Chen Ding-nan, Finance Minister Yen

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN'S INDUSTRIAL SECTOR MONITORING DEVELOPMENTS IN AFGHANISTAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  8  (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Those in Taiwan's industrial circles,
particularly in the high-technology sector, are closely observing
developments regarding the U.S.-led coalition military action in
Afghanistan as an extended war in the region would definitely affect
international trade.</P>
      <P>Huang Chih-peng, secretary-general of the China External Trade
Development Council, said Monday that a prolonged war in the Central
Asia and Middle East regions would have an adverse effect on Taiwan's
export industries. He pointed out that trade activity with
counterparts in the Middle East have already been affected, while
exports to the United States might also be hit hard in the long run.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's industry and trade organizations have temporarily
suspended all trade promotion missions to the Middle East.</P>
      <P>The high-technology sector has been extremely concerned about the
impact of the long anticipated military conflict, worrying about
mounting transportation risks and possible increases in raw material
prices on the one hand, and a prolonged global economic recession on
the other.</P>
      <P>The Hsinchu Science-based Industrial Park Administration convened
an emergency meeting early Monday to study measures to secure raw
material supplies and sales channels.</P>
      <P>James J. Lee, director general of the administration, said that
the park administration has adopted prudent security measures and has
guaranteed sufficient water and electricity supplies.</P>
      <P>An official of the Institute for Information Industry (III) said
that in the event that the military conflict in the region lasts
longer than 50 days, Taiwan's electronics and communications
equipment manufacturing industries would be further disappointed in
terms of its hopes for a gradual recovery.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's electronics and information sectors have suffered from
serious sales decreases since early this year. A long-term conflict
in the region would prolong the global economic recession, according
to Chan Wen-nan, director of III's Market Information Center (MIC).</P>
      <P>Quoting an MIC report on the impacts of the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks in the United States, Chan said the attacks have further
weakened dwindling consumer confidence in the United States, adding
that the U.S. economy is not likely to come out of the doldrums
before the second quarter of next year.</P>
      <P>This is bad news for Taiwan's electronics and information
industries as the United States is the largest market for Taiwan
exports.</P>
      <P>Chan forecast that Taiwan's electronics sector can only expect a
sales recovery by the second or third quarter of next year at the
earliest, adding that prolonged warfare would push the world economy
deeper into recession and that unpredictable factors might place the
industry into deeper adversity.</P>
      <P>In the first eight months of this year, export orders received by
Taiwan's information and communications industries amounted to
US$15.7 billion, down 12.9 percent from the level for the same period
in the previous year. The electronics sector in the January-August
period received US$17.2 billion worth of export orders, down 18.3
percent from that of the same period last year, according to
statistics released by the Ministry of Economic Affairs.</P>
      <P>While the electronics and information sectors remained Taiwan's
major foreign exchange earners, sluggish sales in these sectors lead
to a 9.7 percent year-to-year decrease in the total value of Taiwan's
export orders received in the first eight months.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC TO "ACTIVELY PARTICIPATE" IN GLOBAL ANTI-TERRORISM CAMPAIGN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  8  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Foreign Affairs Minister Tien Hung-mao
reaffirmed Monday that the Republic of China government is opposed to
any form of terrorism and that it will "actively participate" in the
anti-terrorism campaign launched by the United States.</P>
      <P>Tien made the remarks when he attended a foreign affairs
committee meeting in the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, Tien took part in an emergency meeting
convened by the Executive Yuan during the early morning in the wake
of U.S. and British military strikes on Afghanistan for harboring
Osama bin Laden, the prime suspect in the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks
in the United States. He also attended a national security meeting
convened by President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>Tien said that as the ROC is not on the front lines, it has not
supplied any direct military assistance to the United States in the
anti-terrorism campaign. He added however that the ROC has had close
exchanges with the United States and has offered it any assistance it
requires, but that the United States has so far not requested any.</P>
      <P>He also said that in his judgment, the anti-terrorism campaign
will be a long-term one and that it will not be limited to the
military sphere, adding that the Ministry of National Defense and the
National Security Council have discussed issues related to the use of
ROC airspace by U.S. warplanes.</P>
      <P>Tien said that Taiwan has received written notification of the
commencement of the military strikes but that it is not expected to
take part in the conflict. The ROC, however, will actively work with
the United States in other areas such as intelligence sharing,
cracking down on money laundering, the monitoring of suspects, and
the freezing of accounts of suspected terrorists, he added.</P>
      <P>The ROC's representative office in the United States has
exchanged views on money laundering with its U.S. counterpart, Tien
said, adding that financial authorities in Taiwan have also prepared
to deal with the situation.</P>
      <P>He also said that Fredrick Chien, president of the nation's top
watchdog body the Control Yuan, will fly to New York City in a few
days to comfort overseas Chinese and the family members of the
victims that died in the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center
Sept. 11.</P>
      <P>In the aftermath of the terrorist attacks, the ROC government had
scheduled to send officials to New York City and Washington, D.C., to
extend its concerns, Tien said. In order not to trouble the U.S.
State Department and due to the fact that ranking ROC officials still
can not visit Washington, D.C., Chien will limit his visit to New
York City only, he added.</P>
      <P>Tien also said that his ministry has alerted overseas offices,
especially those in the Middle East, to step up protection of ROC
nationals in the wake of the outbreak of military conflict. As there
are more than 3,000 ROC nationals residing in Saudi Arabia and
Kuwait, the ministry will also provide financial support if
necessary, he said.</P>
      <P>He also said that the ROC government hopes to actively take part
in assisting Afghan refugees, but added that it will also take
Taiwan's domestic financial situation into consideration when
determining the extend of its assistance.</P>
      <P>Tien stressed that if the ROC government wants to take part in
humanitarian efforts, it will have to do so through international
organizations, but the premise will be not to fuel the worsening
economy.</P>
      <P>He said that the ROC did provide financial assistance to the
U.S.-led coalition during the Persian Gulf War, but noted that due to
the dire straits of Taiwan's present economic situation, it will
first have to take domestic financial factors into account.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN HEIGHTENS ALERT AGAINST POSSIBLE BIOLOGICAL TERRORIST ATTACK</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  8  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan authorities said Monday that they
have heightened their preparedness against possible biological
attacks amid growing concerns that global terrorists may be planning
to use chemical or biological agents against civilians.</P>
      <P>Lee Ming-liang, director-general of the Cabinet-level Department
of Health said at the Legislative Yuan Monday that deadly anthrax and
other biological agents could be used in a terrorist attack following
the Sept. 11 attacks in the United States.</P>
      <P>He said anthrax is most worrisome because it can be deployed
relatively easily and kills about 90 percent of the people it
infects. So far only the United States has developed a vaccine
against anthrax and there are scant supplies of it available.</P>
      <P>Infection by anthrax is virtually incurable once symptoms
develop, Lee said, adding that initial flu-like symptoms develop two
to three days after the bacteria is inhaled. This is followed by high
fever, vomiting, aching joints, labored breathing, internal and
external bleeding, lesions and usually death.</P>
      <P>Clostridium botulinum, a deadly bacteria usually found in
contaminated canned or processed foods, could also be used if a
bio-terrorist attack is launched, Lee said, adding that this lethal
agent can be controlled in Taiwan as domestic medical institutions
have an antidote for it.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is also capable of containing smallpox, which could also
be used in an attack, Lee said, adding that the island has enough
base materials to be processed into some 1 million doses of vaccine
against smallpox, despite the fact that this disease was eradicated
from Taiwan years ago.</P>
      <P>Lee said domestic medical centers and medical institutions at all
levels have been urged recently to strengthen their systems of
notification in preparation for possible bio-terrorist attacks.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Cabinet-level Environmental Protection
Administration (EPA) called a meeting Monday afternoon to discuss
drills and contingency measures against possible chemical warfare.</P>
      <P>The meeting was attended by officials from the ministries of
national defense, interior and transportation and communications in
addition to the EPA.</P>

      <P>Republic of China Minister of Foreign
Affairs Tien Hung-mao said Monday that Taiwan will not be absent from
the informal leadership conference of the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) forum to be held in Shanghai later this month.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks while answering questions raised by some
legislators at the Foreign and Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee of
the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Tien noted that President Chen Shui-bian has reiterated his
intention of attending the leadership conference out of his goodwill,
hoping that he can meet with Beijing's top leader at the
international meeting to exchange views on cross-Taiwan Strait
issues.</P>
      <P>The foreign minister pointed out that as APEC is a very rare and
important international forum in which Taiwan is a member, the ROC
would not and should not be absent.</P>
      <P>He said that his ministry would continue negotiating with Beijing
through the channel of the APEC senior officials' meeting on Taiwan's

      <P>Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian
Monday received Japanese Lower House member Sadanori Yamanaka, the
head of a Japanese delegation for the ROC National Day celebrations.</P>
      <P>Chen welcomed the delegation and thanked Yamanaka for his long
years of contributions to the promotion of substantive relations
between Japan and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Yamanaka, a former director-general of the Japan Defense Agency,
is now chairman of the cross-party "Japan-ROC Parliamentarians'
Council."</P>
      <P>Chen affirmed the council's efforts to win the Japanese
government's approval for Taiwan citizens to transit in Japan without
visas for 72 hours and recognize the legality of the passports issued
by the ROC government. The two countries broke off formal ties in
September 1972.</P>
      <P>During the reception, Chen told the senior Japanese lawmaker that
as a member of the democratic world, the ROC, like Japan, fully
supports the U.S.-led military actions against terrorism in
Afghanistan.</P>
      <P>He said the significance represented by the military actions is
"respect for life" and "upholding human civilization," because

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislator Diane Lee of the People First
Party (PFP) said Monday she was gratified to learn that the Taipei
Prosecutors' Office has publicly indicted legislator Lo Fu-chu for
beating her earlier in the year.</P>
      <P>The Taipei Prosecutors' Office has also asked the Taipei
Municipal Police Bureau to list Lo, an independent lawmaker and the
self-proclaimed spiritual leader of the Heavenly Path Alliance gang,
as a gangster.</P>
      <P>The Taipei police said that upon receiving the request and
related information, it will start the process of evidence collection
and discussions before it will list anyone as a gangster.</P>
      <P>Lee said that she was comforted to know that "there is justice in
society, and that the Republic of China is a society bound by
legality, and violence will not be repeated."</P>
      <P>Lee recalled that she was openly threatened and assaulted in the
legislature by her colleague and said that the incident was
"incredible." Lee was trying to expose an alledged scandal
surrounding the Ching Wen Senior High School earlier this year,
adding that "her injuries were small compared with the damage the
incident left on the record of Taiwan's democratic development."</P>
      <P>Lee, who was rated the most outstanding legislator in a recent
magazine survey, also said that the prosecutor in the case conducted
several court hearings -- to which she attended -- but that there was
nothing that could be done about Lo as he failed to show up for the
hearings.</P>
      <P>Lo, who buckled under the pressure of public cencure after the
incident imposed a six-month suspension from the Legislative Yuan on
himself.</P>
      <P>Lo is now back in the spotlight for another reason - his son.
There is a current dispute in the Finance Committee which surrounds
the rule banning any lawmaker from chairing any committee for three
sessions in a row.</P>
      <P>The rule would prevent Lo's son, Lo Ming-tsai, from chairing the
committee, as it would be his third-straight session as convenor --
even though he was elected to the position.</P>
      <P>The legislature's plenary session will now handle the matter
Tuesday, but the financial committee will not meet until Oct. 15. By
that time Lo's self-imposed suspension will have expired and he is
presumed to then return to the legislature.</P>
      <P>Lo, whose self-imposed suspension will expire on Oct. 12, has not
ruled out the possibility of running for the position himself if his
son is not allowed to preside again.

TAIWAN HAS SUFFICIENT COMMODITIES SUPPLIES: AGRICULTURE HEAD</P>
      <P>Taipei, Oct. 8 (CNA) Taiwan has sufficient stockpiles of basic
commodities to allow the island to feed itself for three to six
months, the head of the Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture (COA)
said Monday.</P>
      <P>COA Chairman Chen Hsi-huang said the island will not be caught
with a food shortage, at least for three months, should a war break
out that affects Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In response to growing concerns over the just-initiated U.S.-led
military action against the Taliban militia in Afghanistan, which has
been accused of sheltering Osama bin Laden, the prime suspect of the
Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on the United States, and bin Laden's
al-Qaeda terrorist network, the COA called a contingency meeting
Monday to review the country's preparedness.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, the nation has a rice stockpile of about
600,000 metric tons. With another 1.44 million metric tons expecting
to be incorporated into the existing stockpile by the end of this
year, Taiwan will have six months of reserves.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has three months in reserve of wheat, soybeans and corn,
Chen said.</P>
      <P>The only thing that the COA is concerned about currently is that
shipping of the commodities, a great majority of them having to be
imported from the United States, may be affected by the military
actions, Chen added.</P>

      <P>No trace of the wreckage or crew of
a twin-seater F-5F jet fighter which went missing off Taiwan's
eastern coast Friday has so far been discovered, military sources
said Monday.</P>
      <P>The Hualien Coast Guard said although the 72-hour "golden time"
for rescue ended 4 p.m. Monday, the search and rescue mission will
continue until high-ranking government authorities order a halt to
the operation.</P>
      <P>Over the past three days, patrol boats and helicopters have
conducted an intensive search off Taiwan's east coast for the missing
fighter, which lost radio contact 60 nautical miles northeast of the
eastern county of Taitung Friday.</P>
      <P>Military and coast guard authorities have conducted more than 10
three-hour helicopter search missions and dispatched dozens of
warships, patrol boats as well as 200 to 300 fishing boats to search
for the ill-fated fighter.</P>
      <P>The F-5F fighter jet took off from the Chih Hang Air Base in
Taitung, some 300 kilometers southeast of Taipei Friday afternoon on
a routine training mission. It disappeared from the air base's radar
screen and lost radio contact with the control tower at 3:08 p.m.</P>
      <P>Initial investigations by a special Republic of China Air Force
investigative team showed that the aircraft might have mistakenly
entered an area of cloud cover due to making a wider-than-normal turn
during the training flight. The flight was to test an airborne-ground
communication facility, military sources said.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, air force sources said, further investigation is
needed before the true cause of the accident can be determined.</P>
      <P>The missing pilots were identified as Maj. Lee Chih-min, 36, and
Capt. Kang Hung-chou, 31.</P>
      <P>Over 100 F-5E/Fs remain in service in the ROC Air Force.</P>

      <P>The United States military action in
Afghanistan will help spur global investment sentiment by brushing
aside many uncertain factors, Council for Economic Planning and
Development (CEPD) Chairman Chen Po-chih said Monday.</P>
      <P>Since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in New York and Washington,
investors across the world have been mired in uncertainties, Chen
said, adding that should the war against Afghanistan not spread too
much, the impact on the global economy will be limited.</P>
      <P>The CEPD head, however, pointed out that it is still too early to
comment to what extent the war would affect the local economy now
that it is impossible for it to regain momentum by the end of this
year.</P>
      <P>Wu Hui-lin, a researcher at Change Hua Institution for Economic
Research, however, predicted that business conditions in the world
market would rebound very robustly in the short term, as the new
hi-tech war will not last long and "high-risks will bring about high
investment returns."</P>
      <P>Wu said optimistically that "it is unnecessary to wait until next
year for the recovery to take place" on the ground that "vast damage
will produce opportunities for construction."</P>
      <P>Since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks against the United States,
countries across the world have been closely monitoring subsequent
developments and have taken measures to cope with possible
situations, Wu said, noting that short-term pains will eventually
pass and everyday life will get back to normal soon.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC) said Monday it is waiting for a Hong Kong government response
to its proposal for negotiations on renewal of an aviation pact
between Taiwan and Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>The council, which charts Taiwan's policy toward mainland China
and handles affairs concerning Hong Kong and Macau after the two
former Western colonies reverted to Beijing rule, was responding to
a Hong Kong newspaper report that the MAC had given up its intention
to "intervene" in aviation talks.</P>
      <P>MAC officials said the current Republic of China statute
governing relations with Hong Kong and Macau clearly stipulates that
the MAC is the agency in charge of aviation talks with Hong Kong and
must take part in all relevant negotiations.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, the officials said, it is inappropriate
for the Hong Kong paper to describe the MAC's handling of the issue
as "intervention."</P>
      <P>The officials said the MAC has completed all planning work for
new aviation pact negotiations. "However, we have so far not
received any response from Hong Kong authorities," said an official
of the council, who preferred anonymity.</P>
      <P>The current Taiwan-Hong Kong aviation pact was signed in 1996 and
the two sides originally agreed to review the accord once every five
years.</P>
      <P>According to its provisions, the accord expired June 13 this
year. As Hong Kong authorities were reluctant to negotiate with the
MAC, the two sides agreed through talks between their carriers to
extend the existing accord to the end of this year.</P>
      <P>Under the present pact, Taiwan and Hong Kong can both allow their
carriers to operate a total of 121 weekly flights between the two
places.</P>
      <P>At present, Taiwan's China Airlines can operate 105 flights per
week, while EVA Airways can only operate 16 weekly flights.
Meanwhile, Hong Kong assigns 100 flights to its Cathay Pacific
Airways and 21 flights to Dragon Air.</P>
      <P>With more and more Taiwan investors and managers relocating to
mainland China, the Taiwan-Hong Kong route has become one of the
hottest routes. Both EVA and Dragon Air have long desired to increase
their flights on the route, airline sources said.</P>

      <P>The National Police Administration (NPA)
instructed police Monday to strengthen protection of foreign
personnel stationed in Taiwan following the attacks on Afghanistan by
the U.S.-led anti-terrorism coalition.</P>
      <P>A provisional command center to cope with emergency situations
was been formed at the NPA shortly after the attacks began, according
to NPA Director-General Wang Chin-wang.</P>
      <P>Wang said that the NPA has asked foreign embassies, consulates,
representative offices, residences of foreign ambassadors to the
Republic of China, foreign schools, companies and chambers of
commerce -- especially those of the United States -- to step up
security measures.</P>
      <P>In addition, security has been increased at the nation's ports
and airports, Wang said.</P>
      <P>At present, there are 180 people from the Middle East residing in
Taiwan, all of whom hold long-term visas, Wang said, adding that
"nothing unusual" has been found.</P>
      <P>Wang said the NPA has asked the Bureau of Immigration to pay
close attention to a list of terrorists provided by Interpol and the

(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Vice Chairman
Lin Chong-pin predicted in his capacity as a political science
professor Monday that mainland China is unlikely to launch a military
action against Taiwan in the short term.</P>
      <P>Lin said that because the United States has repeatedly stressed
that it will not sacrifice Taiwan's interests in exchange for
Beijing's support for the U.S-led anti-terrorist coalition, any
mainland Chinese military action threatening Taiwan will create
"inconsistencies" between Beijing and Washington.</P>
      <P>Lin went on to say that because Beijing is currently placing
greater emphasis and attention on independence issues in its western
territories, it is unlikely to mount an attack against Taiwan at this
point.</P>
      <P>He said that if the war against Afghanistan's Taliban regime
drags on, the U.S. economy will be adversely affected, which would
have negative repercussions on mainland China because of its export
industries' reliance on the American market.</P>
      <P>Under such circumstances, it would be interesting to see if
mainland China would still have the extra strength to attack Taiwan,

      <P>Republic of China Minister of Foreign
Affairs Tien Hung-mao said Monday that he does not believe mainland
China will take advantage of the ongoing U.S.-led military action in
Afghanistan to invade Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He told the Foreign and Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee of the
Legislative Yuan that the United States has promised the ROC
government more than once that it will not sacrifice Taiwan's
security.</P>
      <P>Tien noted that the highest-priority task of the United States is
the war against terrorism and added that the cross-Taiwan Strait
issue is not an urgent matter for Washington at the moment.</P>
      <P>The foreign minister pointed out that the U.S. government has
guaranteed to Taipei that it will not alter its strategy toward the
Asia-Pacific area.</P>
      <P>Regarding Beijing's support of the U.S. action against terrorism,
Tien said that Washington's view is that Beijing wants to use the
opportunity to mend its ties with the Bush administration and to
create a goodwill atmosphere for President George Bush's
participation in the Oct. 20-21 leadership conference of the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Shanghai.</P>
      <P>In addition to the APEC factor, Tien said that mainland China
will not take military action against Taiwan at present because it
needs a harmonious environment to devote its full energy toward
economic development and to resolving the upcoming leadership issue.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Mainland Affairs Council Chairperson Tsai Ing-wen also
told legislators that the possibility of mainland China using force
against Taiwan at present is remote.</P>
      <P>She said that after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on New York
and Washington, the Taipei authorities had tried through foreign
institutions stationed in Taiwan to give Beijing an understanding of
Taiwan's hope for maintained stability across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Tsai added, Taiwan must take precautionary measures
in national defense and foreign relations, as a "misjudgment" by

    <HEADLINE>OPPOSITION AT LEGISLATURE RESOLVE TO RETURN GOVERNMENT BUDGET</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  8 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An umbrella group of opposition parties at
the Legislative Yuan demanded Monday the government withdraw what it
described as a "flawed" 2002 budget and warned that it will
be returned to the Executive Yuan for revamping.</P>
      <P>The group made up of the Kuomintang (KMT), the People First Party
(PFP), the New Party and the Alliance of Independents claimed at a
news conference that the budget has heavily inflated the government
revenue and has failed to account for the government's new financial
needs.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lai Shyh-bao of the New Party said his party will come
up with a motion at the Legislative Yuan Tuesday demanding the return
of the budget.</P>
      <P>The economist-turned-legislator said the 2002 budget fails to
accommodate the NT$100 billion (US$2.94 billion) needed to implement
the recommendations put forward by the Economic Development Advisory
Conference.</P>
      <P>It also fails to account for the financial impact on the
government's ways and means from the island's imminent entry into the
World Trade Organization.</P>
      <P>He questioned the government's promise to pump an extra NT$500
billion (US$14.7 billion) into public projects over the next five
years to stimulate economic growth, since there is absolutely no
trace of this extra spending in the budget.</P>
      <P>Although the Executive Yuan may submit a complementary budget to
cover the funds for the above agenda, Lai said it will strain the
legislative session, which is barely long enough to go through the
main budget.</P>
      <P>Since the lawmakers will not begin to debate the budget until
after the Nov. 2-Dec. 2 recess, Lai said the government still has
enough time to conduct a re-draft.</P>
      <P>Although his party will propose sending back the budget, it would
be preferable for the Executive Yuan to withdraw the budget to "save
face," said Lai.</P>
      <P>Cheng Long-shui, another New Party lawmaker, said the 2002 budget
was prepared on the forecast that the island's economy will expand by
more than 5 percent next year, which has already turned out to be pie
in the sky.</P>
      <P>The government's latest projection, released in August, revised
the economic growth to 4.2 percent, while foreign institutes put it
at between just 1 percent and 2 percent.</P>
      <P>The government's unrealistic economic projection will render its
estimates of exports, imports, trade surplus and revenue inaccurate
and its budget unfeasible, said Cheng.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, he went on, the government needs more money to deal
with the financial fallout from the U.S. strikes against Afghanistan
and the disaster caused by Typhoon Nari which cut a swathe across the
island Sept. 16.</P>
      <P>Arguing along the same lines, PFP Legislator Chou Hsi-wei claimed
that the 2002 budget has inflated its means by at least NT$100
billion and should be withdrawn and adjusted.</P>
      <P>Besides dressing down the government for what they called a
fault-infested budget plan, the opposition also excoriated President
Chen Shui-bian and Premier Chang Chun-hsiung for their lambasting of
the opposition at a DPP campaign rally in Taichung a day earlier.</P>
      <P>On that occasion, Chen and Chang blamed the opposition-controlled
legislature as the root cause of the island's political unrest,
saying the opposition has tried to block the government's agenda at
every turn, almost crippling it as a result.</P>
      <P>They urged their supporters to return DPP candidates to the
legislature in the year-end elections to help rid the country of the
political scourge that is the opposition in the legislature.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislative Whip Lee Cheng-chung dismissed the claims as a
"groundless smear" that has driven the opposition parties to the
limit of their tolerance.</P>
      <P>Lee said the opposition will turn the budget back to the
Executive Yuan to show the premier that his "campaign gambit" had
backfired.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lin Chuan, head of the Directorate General of Budget,
Accounting and Statistics said that although the government's budget
is based on an outdated economic growth forecast, the budget is not
unfeasible.</P>
      <P>Arguing that economic growth is only one of many factors taken
into consideration when drafting the budget, Lin cited this year as
an example, saying the 2001 budget was made on a growth forecast of 6
percent, but the government's revenue is only NT$3 billion shy of its
projection, despite the fact that there is now expected to be
negative economic growth.</P>
      <P>Lin also said the U.S.-led strikes against the Taliban regime has
cast a cloud over the economic prospects for the whole world, the
fallout of which has not yet fully sunk in and which the government
has no way of getting to grips with in the budget.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NOBEL LAUREATE CALLS FOR TAIPEI-BEIJING DIALOGUE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  8  (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Academia Sinica President Lee Yuan-tseh
called Monday for a resumption in Taipei-Beijing dialogue and for
mankind to unconditionally renounce the use of force.</P>
      <P>In an open message, the Nobel laureate in chemistry wrote that
there is no reason for the people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait
to face each other with weapons raised because there is no deep
hatred between them.</P>
      <P>He said that mankind should not continue to believe in the
"superstition" that brute force can resolve disputes, and that there
is also no reason for the larger of any two neighbors to bully the
smaller one, especially when the two peoples share common ancestry.</P>
      <P>Lee said that the leaders in both Taiwan and mainland China
should realize that an arms race cannot resolve any outstanding
issues between them.</P>
      <P>He added that the two sides should first renounce hostilities and
follow the spirit of the so-called 1992 consensus of "one China, with
each side free to interpret the term separately" in opening
full-scale exchanges and dialogue.</P>
      <P>Under the trend of globalization, he continued, only through
cooperation and the mutual sharing of resources and interests can the
two sides of the strait face the fierce competition of the global
market.</P>
      <P>On a global scale, Lee said, both economic competition and social
development should be conducted on the precondition that they will
ensure mankind's lasting survival.</P>
      <P>He noted that while Western nations were able to acquire great
wealth and strength through industrialization, and some countries in
Asia, Africa and Latin America were able to start catching up with
them, other countries remain mired in famine and poverty.</P>
      <P>Lee said that it was only "a matter of time" before these people
rose up in defiance to seek "justice" through the most basic and
"most barbaric" use of force.</P>
      <P>He added that the environment has also begun to react to
mankind's over-exploitation, in the form of the greenhouse effect
that has been causing changes in global weather patterns and leading
to disasters.</P>
      <P>Lee therefore called for greater sharing of knowledge and
technology to help the majority of the people in the world who are
living in poverty, and to help improve the environment in which
people and other creatures live.</P>
      <P>Because many of these problems cross national boundaries, he said
that multinational cooperation is naturally necessary when seeking
solutions.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A specialist with the Institute for
Information Industry (III) said Monday that Taiwan's economy may be
affected seriously if the U.S.-led military action against terrorism
extends to over 50 days.</P>
      <P>However, Chan Wen-nan, director of the III Market Intelligence
Center (MIC), said in an interview with CNA that if the war ends
within 50 days, the impact on the island's economy may be limited.</P>
      <P>He admitted that he could not predict the extent of the impact as
it depends on the duration and the scope of the war, as well as the
strategies involved.</P>
      <P>Chan said that before the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on New York
and Washington, the MIC estimated that the output of Taiwan's
information industry this year would go down 8 percent compared with
the preceding year.</P>
      <P>After the Sept. 11 incident, he said, the estimate put the extent
of the decrease to 15 percent.</P>
      <P>If the war continues for more than 50 days, he noted, it would
deal a heavy blow to the economy, delaying the island's economic
recovery until the third quarter of next year.</P>
      <P>Chan said that the MIC will release a new forecast on the war's
effect on Taiwan's information industry in the coming days.</P>
      <P>A local research institute has recently predicted that Taiwan's
real economic growth rate this year will dip to minus 1.9 percent,

possibility of flying its military aircraft through the zone before
it staged strikes against Afghanistan early Monday and received a
positive response, military sources said.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan flight information zone bisects the route between
Afghanistan and U.S. bases in Okinawa and Guam. If U.S. transport
aircraft from the bases want to provide logistical support to their
combat forces in the Middle East, they have to fly through the Taiwan
information zone.</P>
      <P>Most of the U.S. aircraft involved in Monday's bombing of

the Indian Ocean, while others came from North Atlantic Treaty

    <HEADLINE>GOV'T APPROVES ADDITIONAL TYPES OF AGRICULTURAL INVESTMENT IN CHINA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  9  (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture
(COA) announced Tuesday that over 200 additional types of
agricultural investment in mainland China will no longer need to be
approved on a case-by-case basis.</P>
      <P>Under previous COA guidelines, only 223 types of agricultural
investment in the mainland were given the automatic green light by
the government. Over 1,100 other types fell under the category
requiring case-by-case assessments.</P>
      <P>Another 10 types of agricultural products remain on the COA's
restricted list under the new guidelines.</P>
      <P>The COA noted that most of the newly approved types of investment
are processed product-related or fishing-related because recent COA
evaluations determined that the impact of approving such kinds of
investment will be minimal on Taiwan's own agricultural sector.</P>
      <P>The COA began conducting assessments on the possible effects of
Taiwan and mainland China's imminent entry into the World Trade
Organization on the domestic agriculture industry after the
government agreed to ease restrictions on local investment in the
mainland across various industries.</P>
      <P>The COA has also established a special task force to routinely
evaluate the further easing of restrictions, approximately once every
six months.</P>
      <P>According to COA figures, a total of 4,108 agricultural
investments in mainland China by Taiwan businesses have been approved
since such investment in the mainland was legalized in 1992. The
total value of these investments is about US$2.15 billion.</P>
      <P>From January to August, Taiwan imported a total of US$320 million
worth of agricultural products from mainland China and exported US$54
million worth of agricultural products in return.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LATEST JIANG REMARKS SHOW NO CHANGE IN MAINLAND POLICY TOWARD TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  9  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin's
latest remarks on relations across the Taiwan Strait show no
fundamental changes in Beijing's policy toward Taiwan, an official of
the main opposition Kuomintang said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chang Jung-kung, director of the KMT's mainland affairs
department, said Jiang reaffirmed Beijing's insistence on the
so-called "one China" policy in his speech delivered at a rally in
Beijing Tuesday to mark the 90th anniversary of the Revolution of
1911, which led to the overthrow of the Ching Dynasty and the
establishment of the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>In his speech, Jiang said as the world is undergoing profound
changes, the Chinese race should stand united to face up to all
new challenges. He further said since the people on both sides of
the Taiwan Strait are all Chinese, they should sit down to talk
under the "one China" principle.</P>
      <P>Jiang stressed that the "one China" principle is the bedrock for
developing cross-strait relations and realize peaceful reunification
of the two sides. While reiterating Beijing's intention to promote
peaceful unification, Jiang also did not hesitate to demonstrate
Beijing's firm resolve to block Taiwan's movement toward
independence.</P>
      <P>Commenting on Jiang's speech, Chang said, it indicates that
mainland China still hopes to forge rapprochement with the people of
Taiwan and their government under the "one China" principle.</P>
      <P>Ten years ago, then-mainland Chinese President Yang Shangkun
also delivered a speech to mark the 1911 Revolution on the eve of
the ROC's Double Ten National Day. In his address, Yang sternly
criticized Taiwan's resistance to Beijing's call for unification
talks and warned Taiwan of disastrous consequences if it declared
independence.</P>
      <P>In contrast, Chang said, Jiang didn't resort to such bellicose
rhetoric. In his view, Chang said, Jiang's "soft" approach was
mainly aimed at winning Taiwan people's hearts.</P>
      <P>Touching on some Taiwan officials' forecast that the two sides of
the Taiwan Strait may resume talks next spring, Chang said such
prediction is meaningless.</P>
      <P>Unless the two sides can compromise on their basic stands, Chang
said, the possibility of resuming cross-strait talks in the near
future is slim, if not nil.</P>
      <P>"If mainland China would not give up its 'one China' principle
and the ROC's current Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)-led
government would not adjust its attitude, cross-strait talks are not
expected to resume any time soon," Chang observed.</P>
      <P>The DPP government has on many occasions said Beijing's "one
China" principle is unacceptable because it downgrades the ROC to a
local-level government under the People's Republic of China --
mainland China's official title.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAJOR OPPOSITION LEADERS FAIL TO SHOW AT PRESIDENT'S SECURITY MEETING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  9 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian presided over the
first meeting of a special task force on contingency plans for
national security in the wake of the terrorist attacks in the United
States and said that he regretted that leaders from the main
opposition parties declined to attend.</P>
      <P>Chen said that despite the fact that the meeting did not include
major opposition figures, it was still a success and could be a model
for future discussions on national security.</P>
      <P>The president said that to solicit support from all parties, he
had invited Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng and the heads of
the three opposition parties -- Chairman Lien Chan of the Kuomintang,
Chairman James Soong of the People First Parry, and convener Hsieh
Chi-ta of the New Party -- for a briefing held at the Presidential
Office by the special task force on the impact on Taiwan of the Sept.
11 terrorist attacks on America.</P>
      <P>The task force, which is comprised of national security staff and
government heads in military, foreign affairs, cross-strait issues,
and the fields of economics and finance, reported on the government's
contingency plans and national security measures.</P>
      <P>The president said that regrettably, except for Legislative Yuan
President Wang, Chairman Frank Hsieh of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party, and Tsai Hao, convener of the Independent
Legislators Alliance, the three leaders of the major opposition
parties did not show up, although they were asked to attend.</P>
      <P>This was the first time that national security staff in a task
force have reported to any opposition leaders.</P>
      <P>However, Chen said the meeting was still significant in that it
attempted to form a mechanism for the government to work with all
the major political parties to discuss contingency plans on major
security issues of the nation.</P>
      <P>Chen stressed that the main purpose of the briefing was to have
the ruling and opposition parties as well as leaders from the
legislature brought up to speed on developments in the policies of
the government so they would understand how the government is
responding to the changing world situation.</P>
      <P>The president said he hoped that this would be the first step
toward creating an atmosphere where all political party leaders can
jointly discuss major challenges to the nation.</P>
      <P>No country is isolated from the impact of the terrorist attacks
in the United States and the subsequent air strikes by the United
States and Britain on Afghanistan, the president said, adding that no
political party or individual in Taiwan is immune from events
unfolding on the world stage.</P>
      <P>Therefore, the president said that faced with the ever-changing
global situation, he has instructed government agencies to come up
with short-, middle-, and long-term contingency plans.</P>
      <P>But he said that even the best plans need to be understood and
accepted by the public and their elected officials.</P>
      <P>Legislative Yuan President Wang said that he appreciated being
invited to the meeting and said that it had a positive impact on the
political landscape.</P>
      <P>Participants at the briefing also included Vice President Annette
Lu, Premier Chang Chun-hsiung, Vice Premier Lai In-jaw, Minister of
National Defense Wu Shih-wen, Chief of the General Staff Tang
Yao-ming, National Security Council Secretary-General Ting Yu-chou,

    <HEADLINE>ROC PRESIDENT HAILS FORMOSA PLASTICS GROUP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Yunlin  County,  Oct.  9 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian expressed
admiration Tuesday for Taiwan's petrochemical giant, Formosa Plastics
Corp. (FPC), and hopes that his administration can emulate the FPC's
working spirit for the country's economic development.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks during a visit to the construction site of
Taiwan's sixth naphtha cracker plant, an investment of FPC, in Yunlin
County, southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>It was the third time that Chen had visited the plant, which is
expected to be completed in 2003. Chen said his frequent visits
represents his respect for FPC Chairman Y.C. Wang and his admiration
of the enterprise's efficient operations strategy.</P>
      <P>The president said that he had adopted FPC's operations strategy
in elevating the administrative efficiency of the Taipei City
Government when he was mayor, but while he planned to do so in the
Central Government when he was president, the related budget was
canceled by the legislature.</P>
      <P>He said he hopes the new legislature, that will be formed after
the year-end elections, can support his plan.</P>
      <P>Chen said that the FPC faced many challenges building the plant
on reclaimed land and showed a spirit that the whole country should
learn from.</P>
      <P>Chen also talked about the "no haste, be patient" policy of
restricting Taiwan's investment in mainland China -- a policy that
the chairman of FPC is opposed to. Chen said his administration did
not eliminate the policy, but rather revised it to an "active
opening, effective management" strategy after gauging the
international situation and cross-strait economic and trade ties.</P>
      <P>After listening to a brief report about the plant, Chen said that
the naphtha cracker plant is being built at a time when global
economic prospects are not good, but with its efficient cost-control
strategy, advanced equipment and production technology, the plant
will be considered one of the best in the world when it goes online.</P>
      <P>The FPC has invested NT$470 billion (US$13.60 billion) in the
first and second stages of the construction of the plant, which will
see 45 petrochemical material sub-plants and house an industrial
port. The plant will be completed in 2003 after an additional
investment of NT$110 billion (US$3 billion).</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  9  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government's tax income has posted a
noticeable fall in September amid a recession which has swept
businesses in all sectors, the Ministry of Finance reported Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The national coffers levied total revenues of NT$78.1 billion in
September alone, down 25.7 percent from the level posted in the
corresponding month a year ago, ministry statistics show.</P>
      <P>Corporate taxes registered a fall of 15.1 percent year-on-year,
while land value increment taxes and stock transaction taxes also
dropped by 73.3 percent and 68.3 percent, to NT$2 billion and NT$2.3
billion, respectively, during the same period.</P>
      <P>Calculating the local bourse's daily trading volume at NT$45
billion for the coming three months, the ministry forecast that stock
transaction taxes might fall short of the official target by NT$34.2
billion for the whole of 2001. The ministry also estimated that the
country's overall tax income this year will reach 93 percent of the
government target, representing a NT$95 billion shortfall.</P>
      <P>As of the end of September, the national coffers registered
NT$1.02 trillion in tax revenues since the beginning of this year, a
decrease of 7.9 percent from the same period of 2000.</P>

    <HEADLINE>HUMAN ERROR MIGHT BE REASON BEHIND MISSING F-5F FIGHTER JET</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  9  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Human error might be the main explanation
for the a Republic of China Air Force F-5F jet fighter that went
missing last week, a senior officer at Air Force General Headquarters
(AFGH) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chin Ping-ho, chief of the AFGH's flight safety division, said
the fighter might have crashed into the sea after its two pilots
became disoriented while flying in an area of cloud cover.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a news conference at the Ministry of National
Defense, Chin said the AFGH team investigating the accident had ruled
out the possibility that the incident was caused by either a
mechanical failure, bird strike or a loss of consciousness of its
pilots.</P>
      <P>From a wingman's recounting of the situation at the time of the
incident and an extensive study of all other available data, Chin
said, the investigative team had tentatively concluded that the plane
mistakenly entered the cloud cover while carrying out a difficult
attitude recovery, leading to the pilots' disorientation and the
crash of the plane.</P>
      <P>As for why the aircraft strayed into the cloud cover -- an
off-limits weather condition for jet fighters -- Chin said the
investigative team concluded that the pilots might have made a
wider-than-normal turn while conducting the maneuver.</P>
      <P>The F-5F fighter took off Friday afternoon from the Chih Hang air
base in the eastern county of Taitung, some 300 km southeast of
Taipei, on a routine training mission.</P>
      <P>A wingman saw the plane fly into the cloud cover at 3:08 p.m.
about 60 nautical miles northeast of Taitung and then lost sight of
and contact with the plane.</P>
      <P>Military and coast guard authorities launched an extensive search
off Taiwan's east coast for the missing twin-seater.</P>
      <P>Over the following four days, military and coast guard
authorities conducted more than 10 three-hour helicopter search
missions and dispatched dozens of warships and patrol boats, as well
as 200 to 300 fishing boats to search for the ill-fated fighter.</P>
      <P>"But so far, no trace of the wreckage or crew of the plane has
been discovered," Chin said.</P>
      <P>He said that although the 72-hour "golden time" for rescue ended
at 4 p.m. Monday, the search and rescue mission will continue for
some time.</P>
      <P>Under current military regulations, a serviceman who has gone
missing for six months can be deemed as having died.</P>
      <P>The missing pilots were identified as Maj. Lee Chih-min, 36, and
Capt. Kang Hung-chou, 31.</P>
      <P>Over 100 F-5E/Fs remain in service in the ROC Air Force.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Hualien Coast Guard discovered two MK25 signal
flares off the eastern county of Hualien Tuesday. But military
authorities said the missing aircraft was not equipped with such
articles. At present, the navy's S-70c helicopters are equipped with
such flares.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The transaction volume of Taiwan's retail
industry totaled NT$3,129 billion (US$91 billion) last year, a growth
of 7.2 percent over 1999, according to government statistics.</P>
      <P>The statistics released by the Cabinet-level Directorate General
of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) show that during the
last five years, Taiwan's retail industry saw an average 7.2 percent
growth in transaction volume.</P>
      <P>A DGBAS official noted that the performance of the retail
industry is strongly linked to economic prospects.</P>
      <P>The official pointed out that Taiwan's economic growth declined
from 5.7 percent in the first quarter of 1998 to 3.4 percent in the
fourth quarter as a result of the Asian financial crisis at that
time. Consequently, the growth in transaction volume of Taiwan's
retail sector dropped from 11.3 percent to 5.3 percent in the same
year.</P>
      <P>Not until the shadow of Asian financial crisis faded in 1999 did
the growth of Taiwan's retail transaction volume surge to 9.4
percent.</P>
      <P>The DGBAS official added that the retail transaction volume not
only represents the market demand, but also reflects consumption.</P>
      <P>He said that during the last five years, the retail transaction
volume accounted for approximately 50 percent of private sector
consumption.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang Legislator Lo
Ming-tsai filed for a constitutional interpretation Tuesday on the
justification for the Taipei Prosecutor's Office request to city
police to have his legislator father listed as a hooligan.</P>
      <P>Lo claimed that the prosecutor's office move to have independent
Legislator Lo Fu-chu listed as a hooligan based on the Hooligan
Prosecution and Wipe-out Act was unconstitutional.</P>
      <P>The Taipei Prosecutors' Office had also prosecuted the elder Lo a
day earlier for a brutal physical attack on People First Party
Legislator Diane Lee.</P>
      <P>The junior Lo lambasted the prosecutors for "violating the
Republic of China Constitution." He called the move an act of
"judiciary white terror" and claimed the judiciary system was
illegally intervening in the legislative system.</P>
      <P>Wearing a face mask, the junior Lo staged a rambling and choking
filibuster, occupying the interpretation podium and completely
paralyzing the morning session.</P>
      <P>The Taipei Prosecutors' Office did not take any action against
the senior Lo -- widely recognized as a thug because of his frequent
public assaults on his colleagues at the Legislative Yuan -- until
Monday, although he beat PFP Legislator Diane Lee in March.</P>
      <P>Lo, who buckled under the pressure of public censure after the
March incident and imposed a six-month suspension from the
Legislative Yuan upon himself, stirred up a new storm at the
Legislative Yuan a few days ago when he ranted and raved at members
of the Legislative Yuan Finance Committee who were discussing the
rule banning any lawmaker from chairing any committee for three
sessions in a row.</P>
      <P>The rule prevents the junior Lo from chairing the committee, as
it would be his third consecutive session as convenor -- even though
he was elected to the position.</P>
      <P>Lo, whose self-imposed suspension will expire Oct. 12, has not
ruled out the possibility of running for the position himself if his
son is not allowed to preside again.</P>
      <P>Nine other lawmakers, including the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP)'s Chang Ching-fang and independent legislators Chao
Yung-ching, Chu Hui-liang and Liao Hsieh-kuang, have also accused Lo
of blackmail and intimidation.</P>
      <P>DPP Party Whip Tsai Huang-liang later denied that the move to
have the elder Lo listed as a gangster is unconstitutional and an
example of "the judiciary intervening in the legislative system."</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 9 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of National Defense (MND) said
Tuesday it is cooperating with the Department of Health (DOH) to
craft a comprehensive plan to cope with biological terrorist attack.</P>
      <P>The MND made the remarks in response to growing public concern
about possible biological terrorist attacks after U.S. and British
forces launched air strikes against the Taliban regime in Afghanistan
in retaliation for its protection of Osama bin Laden, the suspected
mastermind of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in New York and
Washington.</P>
      <P>Wu Shao-pei, director of the MND's medical and health service
division, said that although the Republic of China military at
present may be not capable of coping with a large-scale biological
attack, it can handle small-scale assaults.</P>
      <P>Wu said the MND is working together with the DOH to hammer out
medical care and treatment plans in case Taiwan is attacked with
biological weapons.</P>
      <P>At the moment, Wu said, the MND and the DOH are focusing their
efforts on dealing with attacks by the more common biological weapons
such as anthrax, clostridium botulism and smallpox.</P>
      <P>Wu said that the DOH has formed a special task force composed of
officials from the department's Bureau of Medical Affairs, Bureau of
Pharmaceutical Affairs and the Center for Disease Control, to counter
possible biological terrorist attacks. The DOH has also appointed
eight local hospitals to accommodate victims of biological attacks.</P>
      <P>Wu said the DOH has commissioned the military-run National
Defense Medical College to offer training courses on how to cope with
biological attacks. "The educational program is scheduled to start in
November," he said, adding that relevant DOH and military staff
members at various levels will all take part in the training
workshop.</P>

      <P>The informal leadership conference of the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum to be held in Shanghai
Oct. 20-21 is expected to approve a "Shanghai accord," an economic
specialist said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Wu Rong-i, president of the Taiwan Institute for Economic

"participation, cooperation and promotion for common prosperity."</P>
      <P>He said that the focus of the discussions will center on the
expansion of globalization and the welfare of the new economy, as
well as promotion of trade and investment and ensuring sustainable
growth.</P>
      <P>Wu went on to say that leaders from APEC member economies,
including U.S. President George Bush, are expected to issue a
declaration approving a "Shanghai accord."</P>
      <P>As the U.S.-led military actions against terrorism are being
waged in Afghanistan, he added that the leadership conference will
also discuss how to cooperate to deal with terrorism.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Hsu Tsun-tzu, an official with the Chinese-Taipei APEC
Research Center, said that issues connected with the regional trade
agreement (RTA) will be among the important topics of the upcoming
meeting.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has not yet joined the RTA and Hsu said that Taiwan should
act to become a member of the RTA, as it would provide a wider space
for Taiwan to interact with other member countries.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan delegation to the APEC ministerial meeting will be
jointly headed by Minister of Economic Affairs Lin Hsin-yi and

      <P>More than 100 foreign and mainland Chinese

completing separate three-month "growth camp" training programs aimed
at helping them adapt to Taiwan's lifestyle.</P>
      <P>They were the first groups of foreign and mainland Chinese brides
to have taken part in the Taipei City Government-sponsored training
workshops.</P>
      <P>A total of 73 women from Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand and other
Southeast Asian countries, together with 70 mainland Chinese women,
attended the colorful and fun-filled ceremony in the company of their
Taiwan husbands and other family members.</P>
      <P>During the ceremony, 12 Southeast Asian brides sang a Mandarin
Chinese pop song, to great acclaim. Meanwhile, seven mainland Chinese
brides also received an enthusiastic response for a Xinjiang folk
dance performance.</P>
      <P>Song Yang, a bride from mainland China's Hubei Province, said she
has been married to a Taipei citizen for 10 years. "In the past, I
felt I was like dust and that nobody in Taiwan was concerned about
me. The `growth camp' program has helped make me feel at home here.
It has enabled me to feel the concern and friendship of local
society. I really appreciate the city government for its sponsorship
of the program," she said.</P>
      <P>The workshops offer Mandarin Chinese and Taiwanese language
courses, along with courses in cooking, local customs, Taipei city
history and sightseeing spots, as well as other practical lessons.</P>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou presented commencement certificates to
all 143 "Taiwanese daughters-in-law." He described Taiwan as an
immigrant society that always welcomes new immigrants. "We hope all
foreign and mainland Chinese brides can open their hearts and

said, adding that the city government will continue to sponsor the

      <P>The opposition People First Party (PFP) has
decided to include its chairman, James Soong, at No. 11 on its list
of legislator-at-large candidates for the year-end legislative and
local government chief elections, a party official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>PFP Vice Chairman Chang Chao-hsiung said that Soong has promised
to be a "contributing power" in the new legislature to promote
political and congressional reforms.</P>
      <P>A total of 41 legislators-at-large are expected to be elected in
the Dec. 1 elections for the new legislature, which will have 225
seats, according to a system of proportional representation among the
various political parties.</P>
      <P>Soong was originally not included on the PFP's list because the
party hopes that he can focus his efforts on leading the party.</P>
      <P>However, his absence from the list aroused strong dissent among
the PFP supporters, prompting the party to rethink the decision and
party officials then decided to let Soong have the place of
Legislator Robert Hsu, who rejected his nomination.</P>
      <P>Chang noted that Soong, a former Taiwan provincial governor, did
not reject his original inclusion on the list, but out of
consideration of the scarcity of the seats offered to
legislators-at-large, he decided to give way to other PFP candidates.</P>
      <P>Chang stressed that Soong's inclusion does not mean the party is
mired in crisis for the election, but rather that Taiwan is slipping
backwards too much and needs a "professional team" to resolve the
crisis.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) decided Tuesday to establish a Humanitarian Relief Committee to
help facilitate Taiwan's relief efforts to refugees around the world.</P>
      <P>The work of the committee will be aimed at consolidating
resources from all aspects of Taiwan society to provide emergency
relief, including medical care and supplies of commodities, to
refugees around the world, said sources from the DPP Central
Executive Committee (CEC).</P>
      <P>In a statement released that day concerning Taiwan's reaction to
the attacks by the U.S.-led anti-terrorism coalition on the Taliban
in Afghanistan that began Monday, the CEC said the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks on the United States that toppled New York City's World Trade
Center and destroyed part of the Pentagon in Washington, D.C.,
leaving more than 5,000 people dead or missing, allowed people around
the world to witness terrorism and the adverse impact of war on
mankind.</P>
      <P>The DPP committee urged the Taiwan public to adopt an esprit de
corps at this juncture of global volatility and throw their full
support behind the government to carry out tasks to the greatest
possible interest of the country.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the statement gave President Chen Shui-bian a thumbs
up for his convening of an emergency national security meeting Monday
soon after the start of the reprisal military action in Afghanistan,
whose Taliban regime plays host to Osama bin Laden, the prime suspect
behind the Sept. 11 attacks.</P>
      <P>The committee said the meeting explicitly made known Taiwan's
anti-terrorism stance and the government's determination to protect
the country's national security.</P>
      <P>The contingency measures that were issued by Chen during the
meeting concerning protection of the nation's expatriates and
students living abroad, ways to maintain normal operation of
financial and economic systems and measures to closely monitor the
cross-Taiwan Strait situation, have helped stabilize society and
secured national interests to the greatest possible extent, the

Chan conferred Tuesday with Japanese Lower House member Sadanori
Yamanaka, who is in Taipei for the Republic of China National Day
celebrations.</P>
      <P>The topics of their discussions centered on political and
economic developments in the two countries.</P>
      <P>Lien told the pro-ROC Japanese lawmaker that the KMT has been
striving to help the government stimulate the worsening economy by
lending the party's experiences, policy concepts and talent.</P>
      <P>He added that the party, which lost its 55-year grip on power on
Taiwan to the Democratic Progressive Party in the March 18
presidential election of 2000, is also doing its utmost to ensure the
security and stability of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Lien stressed that the highest priority of the KMT is Taiwan's
interests and therefore the stability of the Taiwan Strait is
required.</P>
      <P>Talking about the upcoming year-end legislative elections, Lien
predicted that it is almost certain that no single party will be able
to control a simple majority of seats in the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>As a result, he said, "party cooperation" after the Dec. 1
elections is unavoidable.</P>
      <P>He said that the DPP government should comply with the
Constitution to implement a "dual leadership" system with a Cabinet
formed by the largest party in the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Otherwise, Lien said, the present political chaos cannot be
improved.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FULL TEXT OF PRESIDENT CHEN'S NATIONAL DAY MESSAGE (I)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 9 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Following is the full text of President Chen
Shui-bian's National Day message which was release on Tuesday:
Distinguished Guests, Ladies and Gentlemen:</P>
      <P>Today is the 90th national day of the Republic of China. It is
also the first of the new century. A year ago, we entered the new
century with the first peaceful transfer of political power in our
history. Twenty-three million people earned Taiwan a place in the
world trend of democracy and freedom with their love and ballots.
This democratic achievement created by all people in Taiwan is the
solid foundation on which we stand firm and look at the world.</P>
      <P>However, this is an era of hope filled with challenges. We
confront not only the unprecedented challenge of economic
transformation, but also the havoc brought by Typhoons Toraji and
Nari, as well as the international adversity from the September 11
terrorist attacks in the United States.</P>
      <P>These domestic and international developments show that the new
century has not brought eternal light and peace to mankind as
expected. The ever-changing international political and economic
situations and unpredictable natural disasters have caused immense
suffering and uncertainties at the beginning of this century.
Consequently, we must solemnly and humbly face the clash of
civilizations and the backlash of nature.</P>
      <P>I believe the disasters caused by the typhoons will pass. The
government has complete confidence and the courage to assist people
through these difficulties and accelerate the reconstruction. On the
other hand, the government and people must learn a lesson and
seriously re-examine critical ecological conservation and land
management issues. We need to stress that "an ounce of prevention is
worth a pound of cure" to prevent disasters in the future.</P>
      <P>Regarding the international community's anti-terrorism campaign,
our government has not only strongly condemned the September 11
terrorist attacks, but has also supported all necessary United States
actions to fight international terrorism. The impact of the September
11 terrorist attacks has extended beyond borders. Whether
economically or politically, Taiwan cannot stand on the sidelines.
Our government has prepared various contingency measures in
anticipation of possible changes in the international situation. I
personally ask all compatriots to remain calm and united, and
understand the importance of "being vigilant in peace time."
Moreover, we should demonstrate a community spirit that holds us
together.
 During the past year, the government's top priority has
been maintaining a stable, peaceful, and safe society, in order to
consolidate democracy in Taiwan and promote various reforms. In the
area of national security, the military has strengthened its
self-defense capabilities while both the military and intelligence
establishment have adhered to the principle of political
neutralization. The cross-strait relationship has remained peaceful
and stable. In international affairs, we have strengthened our
relations with friendly nations and will soon become a member of the
World Trade Organization. Thus, we will be able to establish economic
relations with 140 countries as part of the global economic and trade
system.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the governing and opposition parties and the private
sector collaborated to hold the Economic Development Advisory
Conference during late August 2001, reaching a consensus that
"cultivating Taiwan with a global perspective" will be the
expectation and strategic goal for economic development in the new
century. The fact that all political parties were willing to advance
the enduring interests of the country with an open mind marks a
positive step toward the reconciliation between the governing and
opposition parties.</P>
      <P>In order to strengthen social stability, the government has made
earnest efforts to crack down on organized crime, eliminate
corruption, and restructure the financial system. Its resolve to
improve social order has never wavered. As a result of these efforts,
we have progressively achieved great success. The government's
promises to the people are being realized step by step.

    <HEADLINE>FULL TEXT OF PRESIDENT CHEN'S NATIONAL DAY MESSAGE (II)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 9 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Looking into the future, I would like to propose the following
four main goals of my administration and invite the entire populace
to work together with me:</P>
      <P>I. Re-building economic order</P>
      <P>The government's recent actions to promote reform in the
grass-roots financial institutions demonstrate its strong resolve to
re-establish Taiwan's economic order. The enactment of the six
financial laws indicates that the policy of restructuring the
financial system has won support from both the governing and
opposition parties. Our impending accession to the World Trade
Organization will have an impact on several local industries.
However, the government is well prepared and determined to rebuild
the economic order and maintain a fair and independent market.</P>
      <P>Improving government efficiency is important for economic
activities. Therefore, the government will implement all
recommendations of the Economic Development Advisory Conference on
streamlining and reorganizing government agencies. The government has
decided to invite representatives from all sectors of society to form
a government reorganization committee in the near future to achieve
the government's promise of a "young Taiwan and energetic government"
and build a small but beautiful, capable, and efficient government.</P>
      <P>II. Promoting clean government</P>
      <P>The year-end elections for county magistrates, city mayors, and
legislators will be the first elections held since the change of
governing parties. It will also be a crucial time to test the
government's determination to crack down on "black gold," eliminate
vote buying and corruption, and improve electoral practices. The
government pledges to "declare war on vote buying and severely crack
down on black gold," and will harshly punish corruption and illicit
activities to clean up elections and politics with the ultimate goal
of "eradication of vote buying and elevation of democracy."</P>
      <P>III. Nourishing Civil Society</P>
      <P>Citizen participation is common in a democracy. However,
democratic maturity is achieved on the foundation of rational debate
and mutual respect. After the September 11 disaster in the United
States, American citizens at all levels have united in their fight
against a common foe. They have encouraged each other and extended
unanimous support to the government in its handling of the crisis.
This is a civil society that has been shaped by 200 years of
democracy in the United States.</P>
      <P>A reflection of our experiences over the past year or so shows
that Taiwan's political stability has a direct bearing on its
economic development and public confidence. Only a civil society that
pursues political reconciliation and cooperation between the
governing and opposition parties can constantly develop and produce
the optimum benefits for its people. Therefore, regardless of the
year-end election results, I have pledged to form a coalition
government. The operative model of the Economic Development Advisory
Conference will serve as the best example for cooperation between the
governing and opposition parties and for social harmony.</P>
      <P>IV. Pursuing cross-strait reconciliation</P>
      <P>Although the Chinese mainland has not responded positively to our
government's initiatives to normalize cross-strait relations since my
inauguration on May 20 last year, we will continue to promote
cross-strait reconciliation. The Economic Development Advisory
Conference has reached a consensus on mainland relations that the
"patience over haste" policy should be replaced by a policy of
"proactive opening and effective management" under the principles of
"Taiwan first, global perspectives, mutual benefit, and risk
management."</P>
      <P>In this regard, the ROC government will spare no effort to
establish flexible mechanisms for cross-strait capital flow, cope
with the challenges of our WTO accession and the "Three Links" across
the Taiwan Strait, allow tourists from the Chinese mainland, and
continue to promote cross-strait consultations.

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 9 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>I call on the leaders of the Chinese mainland to abandon
obsolete and rigid thinking, raise their intellectual horizon in
facing cross-Strait relations in the 21st century, considering themes
such as humanitarianism to overcome the present impasse between the
two sides. With the same cultural heritage, dedication to peace, and
eagerness for mutually beneficial results, business, trade, and
cultural exchanges will help remove political obstacles between the
two sides. Only mutually supportive compassion will resolve
unnecessary conflicts of opinion.</P>
      <P>Pursuing a win-win result for the two sides and maintaining peace
in the Asia-Pacific region are the unavoidable obligations of leaders
on both sides of the Taiwan Strait; otherwise, we cannot face history
or our people. We should be open and positive about developing a new
era during our time.</P>
      <P>Distinguished Guests, Ladies and Gentlemen: During the past
century, the ROC has stood firm in times of adversity. We have upheld
our faith in democracy and free enterprise, with full confidence in
the land, people, and future development. Facing numerous challenges
and difficulties, we have always progressed with great courage and
perseverance.</P>
      <P>Let us jointly fulfill our responsibilities and rebuild our
confidence, so future generations in Taiwan can anticipate and attain
new heights and brilliant prospects.</P>
      <P>In closing, I wish everlasting prosperity to the Republic of
China and good health and happiness to each of you.
Thank you.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FORMER V.P. LI YUAN-ZU TO REPRESENT ROC AT APEC SUMMIT IN SHANGHAI</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 10 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian
has decided to appoint former Vice President Li Yuan-zu to represent
him at the upcoming informal leadership meeting of the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, a senior official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Yu Shyi-kun, secretary-general to the president, said Chen has
directed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to make all necessary
preparations for Li to attend on his behalf the APEC summit meeting
to be held in Shanghai Oct. 20-21.</P>
      <P>Yu said Li, now a senior adviser to the president and a criminal
law expert, makes a perfect envoy to the Shanghai summit as
anti-global terrorism will be one of the major topics to be discussed
at the gathering of the top leaders of the 21 APEC member states.</P>
      <P>Li, 78, has a doctoral degree in law from Bonn University in
Germany. He had served as minister of education, minister of justice
and secretary-general to the president prior to holding the post of
vice president from 1990-1996.</P>
      <P>Yu said that although Li is no longer active in politics, he is
still well respected by the public for his legal expertise, dogged
integrity and dedicated working style.</P>
      <P>Li confirmed in an interview with the domestic press at his home
in the rural county of Miaoli, some 100 kilometers south of Taipei,
that Chen has asked him to serve as the president's envoy at this
year's APEC leadership meeting. But he added that the decision has
yet to be finalized.</P>
      <P>APEC, a regional forum dedicated to promoting free trade and
investment, is one of the few international organizations that
simultaneously admits the two sides of the Taiwan Strait. However,
because of mainland China's opposition, the ROC president has been
barred from attending the annual APEC summit in person and has had to
name a proxy to attend in his stead.</P>
      <P>Although President Chen has repeatedly expressed his desire to
attend the Shanghai summit, Beijing has declined to make any
exceptions regarding its position on the issue.</P>
      <P>Yielding to international realities, President Chen finally came
to a decision Tuesday to name Li as his proxy. Chen has ordered the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs to inform the host country of his
decision through APEC Secretariat or other proper channels. Sources
said mainland China has tentatively agreed to Li's attendance at the
event as Chen's envoy.</P>
      <P>Li, born in the central mainland Chinese province of Hunan, is
now a non-partisan as he didn't re-register his membership with the
previous ruling and now opposition Kuomintang last year. His
neutrality has helped made it easier for him to represent Chen at
the APEC summit, local observers said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan takes part in APEC meetings as an "economy" under the
title "Chinese Taipei" -- an arrangement designed to overcome
mainland China's objection to recognition of Taiwan as a separate
state.</P>
      <P>In the past, Beijing forced Taiwan to limit its representation at
APEC summits to an economics minister or a business leader. Last
year, Central Bank of China Governor Perng Fai-nan led the island's
delegation to the APEC summit in Brunei.</P>
      <P>APEC groups Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, mainland China,
South Korea, United States, Philippines, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan,
Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Peru, Russia,
Singapore, Thailand, Taiwan and Vietnam.</P>

tall, only because the 23 million people of the island have
demonstrated the "Taiwan spirit," which is the most formidable asset
and treasure that the whole the nation and all the people can count
on, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Ever since the beginning of the new year, he said, volatile
changes abroad and at home have greeted us with more challenges than
favorable developments, with more enlightenment than pleasure. The
devastating Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on the United States, for
example, have shocked the entire world and enabled the citizens
around the globe to once again perceive the imperative of
safeguarding freedom, democracy and peace.</P>
      <P>He told the nation that the Republic of China government has not
only strongly condemned the terrorist attacks in the United States,
but has also supported "all necessary U.S.-led actions to fight
international terrorism."</P>
      <P>The ROC, meanwhile, is also willing to do its utmost to offer all
kinds of humanitarian aid to the people or nations in need, he added.</P>
      <P>As global anti-terrorism actions have entered a new era, which
may consequently affect the global situation, Chen said the
government has hammered out a comprehensive contingency strategy
aimed at safeguarding Taiwan's national security, economic safety and
social stability.</P>
      <P>Chen called for the Taiwan public to stay calm and adopt an
esprit de corps in this period of global volatility and throw their
full support behind the government to beef up the nation's ability to
meet international challenges.</P>
      <P>He said that despite the twists and turns over the past year, the
government has managed to maintain a stable situation across the
Taiwan Strait. He urged the leadership in Beijing to perceive and
acknowledge the mainstream opinion in Taiwan to resume the
long-stalled cross-strait dialogue as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The president said that after 12 long years of waiting and
negotiating, Taiwan is finally on the threshold of entering the World
Trade Organization (WTO), and will hopefully become a full member of
the world trade regulatory body at the beginning of 2002.</P>
      <P>With WTO accession nearing, Chen said, Taiwan's trade and
economic regimes are becoming more transparent and globalized. The
new situation is expected to temporarily deal a blow to the domestic
agriculture sector, and the government has been requested to map out
countermeasures to cope with the changes, he added.</P>
      <P>Chen called for concerted efforts and the greatest efficiency
possible from the ruling and opposition parties and from the
executive and legislative branches to implement the 322 conclusions
that were reached during the presidential Economic Development
Advisory Conference held in late August in order to help reinvigorate
Taiwan's floundering economy.</P>
      <P>Taiwan, which was still rebounding from the devastation brought
by the deadly earthquake of Sept. 11, 1999, was again battered by a
spate of typhoons this summer that caused large-scale human
casualties and damage to property.</P>
      <P>Chen said he has asked Academia Sinica President Lee Yuan-tseh to
chair a group comprised of specialists to set up a long-term review
mechanism to reassess Taiwan's past land development policies, and
help find a new path for Taiwan that reconciles urban development and
land conservation.</P>
      <P>Looking to the future, he said, he proposes four main goals for
the Chen administration to strive for -- rebuilding economic order,
promoting clean government, nourishing civil society and pursuing
cross-strait reconciliation -- and invites the entire populace to
work together with him to achieve these goals.</P>
      <P>At the end, Chen said, the elections for legislators, city mayors
and county chiefs slated for Dec. 1 will be a crucial moment for
Taiwan regarding political stability, reforms in all aspects of
society, economic revitalization and eradication of "black gold"
politics in the future.</P>
      <P>He called for constituents around Taiwan to exercise their sense
of justice and integrity to allow the nation to have clean elections.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The China External Trade Development
Council (CETRA) will sponsor a symposium at the Hsinchu Science-based
Industrial Park Thursday on new trends in the wireless market,
particularly in mainland China and North America.</P>
      <P>CETRA officials have invited two specialists from the research
and development departments of the mobile phone manufacturer
Motorola and Astro Design to speak on new designs and market trends.</P>
      <P>The specialist from Motorola will address the development of the
wireless market in mainland China and Motorola's marketing strategies
and deployments in Asia.</P>
      <P>Mainland China has become the fastest-growing wireless market in
recent years and a CETRA report indicates that mainland China has
surpassed the United States to become the largest market for mobile
phones.</P>
      <P>At a recent conference on wireless Internet in Singapore, an
Ericsson China executive said that the number of cell phone users in
mainland China was estimated to exceed 100 million by the middle of
this year. Mainland China also has an estimated 22 million Internet
users and is expected to cross the 100-million mark in 2004,
according to his report.</P>
      <P>In Asia as a whole, the number of cell phone users is expected to
increase from the current 250 million to 600 million by 2005.</P>
      <P>A recent report from Merrill Lynch also points out the rapid
development of the wireless market in Asia. The global market for
wireless Internet software, content and commerce will reach US$25
billion by 2005, with more than 80 percent of the 2 billion wireless
subscribers living outside the United States, according to the
report.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC WELCOMES OVERSEAS CHINESE RETURNING FOR NATIONAL DAY CELEBRATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  10 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China welcomes the return
of overseas Chinese to Taiwan to join their local counterparts for
ROC National Day celebrations, Chang Fu-mei, minister of the Overseas
Chinese Affairs Commission, said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Chang made the remarks while hosting a luncheon for 250 leaders
of returning overseas Chinese groups in Taipei during which she
expressed appreciation to overseas Chinese for their love of the
country and also asked for their continued support.</P>
      <P>With a series of typhoons hitting Taiwan this year, resulting in
a large number of casualties and heavy property losses and dealing a
huge blow to Taiwan's already faltering economy, the commission had
decided to channel some funds toward disaster relief, simplify
celebrations, and cancel sponsored visits for overseas groups to
southern Taiwan. This has resulted in the number of overseas Chinese
returning to Taiwan to celebrate the ROC national day dropping
sharply compared with previous years.</P>
      <P>The commission estimated that as of Tuesday night, some 1,761
overseas Chinese had returned to Taiwan, including 1,334 from the
United States and Canada and 427 from 33 other countries.</P>
      <P>Statistics showed that a record 12,007 overseas Chinese returned
in 1996 because the government wanted to have a big celebration for
the National Day following the nation's first ever popular election
of its president, which was held that year.</P>
      <P>The number of overseas Chinese who returned for National Day
dropped to 6,652 in 1997 because Hong Kong reverted to mainland China
rule in that year and Hong Kong people were no longer counted as
overseas Chinese. The number of overseas Chinese who returned in 1998
for the celebration totaled 7,135. National Day festivities were
canceled in 1999 because of the killer quake that struck the island
Sept. 21, 1999.</P>
      <P>Some 6,681 overseas Chinese returned for National Day in 2000 in
the year when the nation's first peaceful political transition of
power from one party to another took place.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a three-hour National Day Night is scheduled to start
at 7 p.m. today in front of the Presidential Office, with the theme
being warmth, solidarity and creativity. Co Co Lee and Jolin are
among the singers that will perform at the event.</P>
      <P>Because of the recent typhoons, a sluggish economy, and the
U.S.-led war against terrorism, the scale of National Day festivities
has been reduced this year and the traditional fireworks display has
been canceled.</P>
      <P>In related developments, the number of "National Day babies" that
came into the world Wednesday was far lower than that of previous
years.</P>
      <P>Taipei Municipal Hospital for Women &amp; Children welcomed the
arrival of three newborns Wednesday morning. The hospital will not
charge the mothers for the delivery fees. In addition, the hospital
presented a big cake and gifts for each of the three mothers.</P>
      <P>In the past, almost all hospitals in Taipei reported the arrival
of a score of babies on Double Ten day, but the total number has
decreased this year, reflecting the overall trend of the continued
decline in Taiwan's birth rates.</P>

    <HEADLINE>QUARTERLY REPORTS OF LEADING U.S. FIRMS TO AFFECT STOCK MARKETS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 10 (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's stock market analysts are watching
the developments in the U.S. stock market, as the business giants in
the electronics and telecommunications sectors are about to announce
their performances for the third quarter, according to an analysis of
the investment consultant Jardine Fleming Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The analysis released Wednesday indicates that the developments
of the U.S. stock market will have a greater effect on Taiwan's share
prices than the fundamental elements of the domestic economy.</P>
      <P>While the developments of the U.S.-led military actions against
the Taliban regime in Afghanistan are expected to trigger ups and
downs in stock markets around the world, the third quarter reports of
such big firms as Motorola, Intel, IBM, Microsoft and Yahoo will
determine the index fluctuations.</P>
      <P>The analysis suggests that investors observe the economic
forecasts of leading enterprises in the wake of the outbreak of the
warfare in Afghanistan.</P>
      <P>Referring to the price shrinkage of electronics shares in
Taiwan's stock market, the analysis says that electronics share
prices were expected to bottom out in the short run. However, as the
recovery of the sector might be delayed, a rebound of the share
prices will be unlikely.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, statistics released by the Jih Sun securities house's
research department indicate that in the past three months, the
weighted price index of the local stock market dropped by 1,246.49
points or 25.52 percent, from 4,883.43 points June 29 to 3,636.94
points Sept. 28.</P>
      <P>Jih Sun analysts said that the fundamental elements for Taiwan's
economy were not positive and that the weighted price index in the
fourth quarter might fluctuate between 3,400 points and 4,200 points.</P>
      <P>They pointed out that the conflict between the United States and
the Taliban will cause a delay in the world economic recovery. Clear
signs of a U.S. economic recovery might not be seen before the second
half of next year, they added.</P>
      <P>Since 23 percent of Taiwan's exports are shipped to the U.S.
market and since the electronics sector, moreover, exported nearly 40
percent of its output to the United States, Taiwan's manufacturing
industries might gain momentum in the second half of next year, said
the analysts.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC MARKS DOUBLE TEN NATIONAL DAY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  10  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian promulgated
Wednesday the rebuilding of the economy, promoting clean government,
nourishing civil society and pursuing cross-Taiwan Strait
reconciliation as goals for the administration in the coming year.</P>
      <P>Chen appealed to the Beijing authorities to cast away their rigid
ideology to allow them to break the cross-strait political deadlock,
stressing that it is the duty of the leaders of both sides to pursue
a win-win resolution to the stalemate across the strait and maintain
stability in the Asia-Pacific region.</P>
      <P>He made the appeal in an address delivered at a rally in front of
the Presidential Office in downtown Taipei to mark the Republic of
China's 90th Double Ten National Day.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the president told the nation that he has requested
Academia Sinica President Lee Yuan-tseh to pool the island's wisdom
to build up a research and review mechanism to reassess Taiwan's past
land development policies and help find a new "third path" for Taiwan
that reconciles urban development with land conservation.</P>
      <P>Chen was accompanied by First Lady Wu Shu-chen and Vice President
Annette Lu during the celebration activities.</P>
      <P>The national day rally brought together thousands of local people
from all walks of life as well as many foreign dignitaries and
overseas Chinese and Taiwanese community leaders to celebrate the
ROC's birthday, although the celebration scale was much constricted
compared with previous years, as the government decided to practice
economy in the face of global and domestic volatility.</P>
      <P>The annual rally was reduced to a concise 30-minute celebration,
while the folklore gala and fireworks extravaganza that are usually
staged were all canceled.</P>
      <P>The rally was presided over by Legislative Yuan President Wang
jin-pyng, who exhorted his countrymen to adopt a mentality of
gratitude while meeting various challenges. He urged all Taiwan's
voters to stand united and work hand-in-hand to create a "new
miracle" for the country.</P>
      <P>The rally kicked off with the passing of a military police
motorbike company while a tri-service band played marching tunes.</P>
      <P>The military band performance was followed by the playing of
brass-and-flag band from the prestigious Taipei First Girl's High
School, drawing large crowds of spectators.</P>
      <P>Students from selected senior high schools and universities in
Taipei then gave colorful dancing and folk performances, adding much
fanfare and creating a youthful, exuberant and joyful festive mood.</P>
      <P>Similar celebration activities were also staged in major cities
around the island, including a high-profile flag-raising ceremony in
Taichung City, with Taichung Mayor Chang Wen-ying and People First
Party Chairman James Soong jointly presiding.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DOH URGES HEIGHTENED VIGILANCE AGAINST ANTHRAX</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  10 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) has posted
information on anthrax on its Website and has asked local doctors to
heighten vigilance following cases of the rare disease reported in
the United States.</P>
      <P>Twu Shing-jer, director-general of the DOH Center for Disease
Control (CDC), noted that the cases in the United States appeared at
a sensitive time -- with the United States beginning military attacks
on the Taliban in Afghanistan to retaliate against its harboring of
Osama bin Laden, the major suspect in the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks
in New York and Washington.</P>
      <P>One Florida man died Friday of anthrax and a co-worker also
tested positive for the disease. The Palm Beach County health
Department has tested more than 800 people for traces of the
bacterium that causes anthrax. Investigators in Florida have ruled
out any link of the disease to terrorists. A third possible case was
also reported in suburban Virginia.</P>
      <P>Chen Kuo-tung, section chief of Taiwan's CDC, said that a
suspected case of anthrax was reported in 1969, but with the medical
standard at the time, health authorities could not verify if it was
indeed the fatal disease.</P>
      <P>In December 1999, a racehorse at a stable in the Taipei suburb of
Peitou died suddenly of anthrax, but there was deemed to be no risk
of the disease spreading.</P>
      <P>The Anthrax bacterium lives in soil and is spread through food,
skin abrasions or cuts and through the respiratory passage. If
terrorists were to use the powder form of the bacterium and spread
them through a building's ventilation system, the damage would be
terrible, according to DOH officials.</P>
      <P>The disease affects mainly cattle, horses and sheep, but can also
pass to human beings, with the farming and livestock industries the
most high-risk groups.</P>
      <P>The United States is the only country in the world that has
vaccine against anthrax, but it requires a total of six shots within
18 months to give enough protection.</P>
      <P>If humans contract anthrax through the respiratory passage, the
initial symptoms will resemble that of a cold. Patients develop
serious breathing problems a few days later and can die within one or
two days.</P>
      <P>If the disease is contracted through the digestive system, the
symptoms resemble those of acute enteritis, with a death rate of
between 25 percent and 60 percent. The disease is treatable with
antibiotics.</P>

    <HEADLINE>2  ARRESTED FOR POSSESSION OF ECSTASY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  10  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Two people were arrested for ecstasy
possession by Taipei police in an early Wednesday morning raid on a
pub in downtown Taipei.</P>
      <P>Chen Tien-ping, 42, from Australia and Tsai Chih-yuan, 36, from
Singapore, were intercepted by police while entering a pub on Nanking
East Road. Police discovered one MDMA pill, commonly known as
ecstasy, on each of the pair and arrested them immediately.</P>
      <P>Chen, who claimed to work for a Hong Kong newspaper, entered
Taiwan last Friday and was slated to leave later Wednesday. He told
police that a friend gave him the ecstasy pill in March in Australia
and that it lay forgotten in his travel bag. He also claimed he did
not know it is illegal to possess ecstasy in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Tsai, a flight attendant for a United States-based airline,

    <HEADLINE>ENTRY TO LEGISLATURE AIMED AT FORGING DIALOGUE MECHANISM: PFP CHAIR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taichung,  Taiwan,  Oct.  10  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition People First Party
(PFP) Chairman James Soong said Wednesday that he will push for the
establishment of an inter-party dialogue mechanism if he manages to
get into the new legislature to be elected Dec. 1.</P>
      <P>The PFP placed Soong's name at 11th place on its list of
legislator-at-large candidates for the upcoming legislative
elections.</P>
      <P>Soong said the inclusion of his name in the list marks "new
thinking."</P>
      <P>"It signifies our party's determination to present a competent
team in the new legislature to make a real contribution to our
nation," he said.</P>
      <P>For the upcoming elections, 41 legislator-at-large seats are
available, which will be distributed among the various political
parties in proportion to the number of ballots they collect in the
elections for regional legislative seats.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan's Legislative Yuan has long been in a mess,
Soong said he looks forward to entering the legislature to push for
its overall reforms.</P>
      <P>"If I can enter the parliament, I will invite the president or
the premier to conduct extensive policy debates on the legislative
floor so as to establish a viable dialogue mechanism between the
ruling and opposition parties," he said.</P>
      <P>Soong went on to say that although there is a majority party in
the legislature at the moment, it lacks ideals, policy and direction
to bring prosperity to the nation.</P>
      <P>In his view, he said, no party will win more than half of seats
in the new legislature. "Against this backdrop, we must use new
thinking to cope with this new scenario," he noted.</P>
      <P>He criticized the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) for
its inability to integrate domestic resources to boost national
development. "Our ruling party is just good at election campaigning
but has failed to come up with any policy initiatives to address the
many thorny issues faced by our country," he lamented.</P>
      <P>According to Soong, some of his friends have expressed doubt
about his wisdom in seeking a legislative seat, as they do not think
it will help his future political career.</P>
      <P>"I have not made the decision based on my personal interests. My
main purpose is to help forge a new legislative culture. Taiwan will
have a new future only if it can establish a new legislature," Soong
said.</P>
      <P>Once he enters the parliament, Soong said, he will give his top
priority to presenting innovative policy proposals to cope with major
public issues.</P>
      <P>He refrained from making any direct comment on President Chen
Shui-bian's latest decision to name former Vice President Li Yuan-zu
to represent him at the informal leadership meeting of the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum to be held in Shanghai Oct.
20-21.</P>
      <P>Instead, Soong outlined three principles for the future
development of relations across the Taiwan Strait -- opposing
secessionism; supporting the "one China" concept under the premise
that the Republic of China's survival and its democratic political
system and lifestyle will never be sacrificed; and recognizing the
so-called "1992 consensus" that allows each side to have its own
definition of "one China."</P>
      <P>Soong said he is convinced that the lingering cross-strait limbo
can be broken only when the DPP government agrees to these basic
principles. Otherwise, he said, cross-strait ties will lead nowhere.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A delegation of agricultural officials,
farm trade experts, bioscientists and farmer's association executives
left for mainland China Wednesday to attend a fruit and vegetable
trade fair.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lin Feng-hsi of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party, who is leading the delegation, said prior to his departure
that the Oct. 11-14 trade fair in the southeastern mainland port city
of Xiamen provides a forum for Taiwan to introduce its fine-quality
fruits and vegetables to mainland and foreign consumers.</P>
      <P>Lin said he is confident that many kinds of Taiwan fruits and
vegetables will enjoy wide appeal at the trade show, which is being
co-sponsored by the United Nations and the mainland Chinese
authorities to boost agricultural development in the Asia-Pacific
region.</P>
      <P>More than 1,000 companies from 22 Asia-Pacific countries and
various mainland Chinese provinces and municipalities are
participating in the unprecedented fruit/vegetable exposition. The
Taiwan delegation will man 50 vending booths displaying a variety of
seasonal fruits and vegetables.</P>
      <P>In addition to seeking long-term export orders, Lin said, the
Taiwan delegation will also take advantage of the event to conduct
substantive talks with representatives from nine southern mainland
Chinese provinces on the entry of Taiwan fruits into the mainland
market.</P>
      <P>Lin said the talks will focus on trading terms, inspection and
quarantine measures, refrigeration technology and transportation
routes. Provincial-level mainland officials and agricultural and
biotechnology experts, as well as farm trade executives from the nine
mainland provinces, including Fujian and Guangdong, will take part in
the negotiations.</P>
      <P>In preparation for Taiwan and mainland China's imminent accession
to the World Trade Organization (WTO), Lin said, Taiwan must step up
efforts to tap mainland Chinese and other overseas markets to
minimize the adverse impact of market opening required by WTO
provisions.</P>
      <P>With its advanced agricultural technology and bioscience
expertise, Lin said, Taiwan should have a niche in the global
high-end fruit market.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The heads of Taiwan and mainland China's
basketball associations met in Bangkok Wednesday in an attempt to
hammer out an agreement over an acceptable new name for a previously
Taiwan-based basketball team that recently relocated to the mainland.</P>
      <P>Chinese Taipei Basketball Association President Wang Jen-cheng
and China Basketball Management Center Director Xin Lancheng agreed
that the Sina.com-financed team should be allowed to participate in
Division A league basketball competitions in mainland China and that
the mainland fully understands the related laws and regulations in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>However, Wang said that both he and Xin would still have to
consult with the relevant agencies of their respective governments
before they can decide on an appropriate name for the team, which had
originally proposed including either "Taiwan" or "Taipei" in its name
but was forbidden from doing so.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council and National Council on
Physical Fitness and Sports rejected the proposal on the grounds that
it might boost Beijing's claims that Taiwan is a part of mainland
Chinese territory.</P>
      <P>The Sina.com team is composed of mainly Taiwanese players and is
now based in the mainland Chinese city of Suzhou.</P>
      <P>Xin said that there should not be any major problems on the
mainland side but added that the final outcome would still have to
depend on Taiwan's own decisions.</P>
      <P>Wang said that the atmosphere during his discussions with Xin was
good and that both were sincerely trying to resolve the problem.</P>
      <P>Because the new season for Division A will not begin until Dec.
8, Wang added that there is still time for the two sides to continue
their discussions.</P>
      <P>Wang and Xin are in Bangkok to attend a meeting of the heads of
various Asian basketball associations and to cheer for their own
respective teams during the semifinal of the 19th Asian Women's
Basketball Championships.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 10 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The American Chamber of Commerce in Taipei
(AmCham) has urged the Republic of China's legislature to pass a
number of bills related to Taiwan's imminent entry to the World
Trade Organization (WTO).</P>
      <P>AmCham, the largest foreign business group in Taiwan, made the
appeal in a statement issued Tuesday in connection with the
celebration of its 50 founding anniversary.</P>
      <P>Noting that WTO accession is expected to bring about many new
business opportunities for Taiwan, AmCham said in its statement that
Taiwan's Legislative Yuan should accelerate screening of the 10-plus
legislative bills concerning the ROC's WTO bid as the Geneva-based
world trade regulatory body is expected to formally approve Taiwan's
membership application at its ministerial meeting scheduled for
November.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, AmCham said the ROC government should also take
action on proposals made at the Aug. 24-26 Economic Development
Advisory Conference (EDAC).</P>
      <P>In its view, AmCham said the EDAC proposal that promotes free flow
of foreign workers and services would help move the Taiwan economy
forward.</P>
      <P>AmCham said in its statement that failure to implement policy
proposals such as these will seriously hinder Taiwan's ability to
become a regional operation hub for multinational firms.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN MIRED IN `DOUBLE CRISIS': NEWSPAPER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 10 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's economy has slipped into a "double
crisis" amid the global economic slump, due to the country's
over-reliance on the U.S. market and on the information technology
sector, according to a newspaper article published Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Quoting a report by the Council for Economic Planning and
Development, the article in the Liberty Times said Taiwan's trade
dependence on the U.S. market, including its direct and indirect
shipments to the United States, has reached 50 percent of its total
exports. Coupled with Taiwan's overemphasis on the IT sector, the
island is mired in a "double crisis" as a result of the global
economic downturn.</P>
      <P>As the second-quarter economic growth rate in the United States
fell to 0.2 percent, the situation has had a serious impact on the
economies of Southeast Asian countries, the report noted. At the same
time, the high reliance of those countries on the U.S. IT sector has
also deepened the impact of the investment bubble in the U.S. hi-tech
industry.</P>
      <P>In 1999, Taiwan hi-tech exports accounted for 37 percent of the
country's total outbound shipments, while the percentages posted by
the Philippines, Malaysia and Singapore were all over 50 percent,
according to the report. It added that Taiwan's hi-tech exports were
doomed to shrink markedly due to the U.S. economic sluggishness this
year, seriously affecting Taiwan's economy.</P>

(By David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A legislator of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) began campaigning for the post of Kinmen
County magistrate Wednesday, becoming the first DPP-nominated
candidate to run for the post since the founding of the party.</P>
      <P>Chen Chao-nan completed the registration procedure and
inaugurated his campaign headquarters on the Taiwan-held frontline
island opposite mainland China's Fujian province, witnessed by DPP
Secretary-General Wu Nai-jen, Deputy Secretary-General Hsu Jen-tu and
Legislator Chang Chun-hung.</P>
      <P>Ever since the government ended the military-controlled
administration system and implemented direct elections of Kinmen
magistrate, the post has always been held by the KMT and the DPP has
never nominated a candidate.</P>
      <P>In a campaign speech, Wu said that now that the DPP is the ruling
party, it considers the development of Kinmen County to be as
important as that of any other county and city in the country.</P>
      <P>In his own speech, Chen noted that the "mini three links" --
direct trade, transportation and postal service between Taiwan's
Kinmen and Matsu islands and mainland China's Xiamen and Mawei --
were implemented by the DPP-led government at the beginning of the
year, a breakthrough in relations across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>He urged the people of Kinmen to vote for him in the year-end
local elections that will take place simultaneously with the
legislative elections.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PROMOTING INDEPENDENCE WILL DRIVE TAIWAN TO ITS DEATH: KMT CHAIRMAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 10 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan independence would be a disaster for
the people of the island and would drive the country to its death,
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Refraining from referring to former President Lee Teng-hui by
name, Lien accused "someone" of promoting Taiwan independence by
making "ungrateful remarks" in public. He said that continuing to do
so will only push Taiwan into a corner.</P>
      <P>Although some people always say they love Taiwan, the KMT
chairman said, "the nation we respect turns out to be a `foreign
power' for them." He did not elaborate.</P>
      <P>Lien made the remarks in Pingtung, southern Taiwan, to KMT
supporters during a joint campaign rally for the party's candidates
who will take part in December's elections for legislative seats and
for local government chiefs.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the performance of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) over the past more than one year, Lien said
the coming elections will serve as an occasion for the Taiwan people
to examine the deeds of the DPP.</P>
      <P>As to recent criticism by Lee about his dreadful performance in
the 2000 presidential election, the KMT chairman was reluctant to
respond, but according to his secretarial staff, such verbal attacks
on Lien are "unfair" and it is not his style to fight back, because
Lien, a "respectful and broad-minded gentleman," feels it is a waste
of time.</P>
      <P>Lien, former vice president and the KMT's candidate in the 2000
presidential race, finished a distant third with just 2.9 million
votes, far behind President Chen Shui-bian's 4.9 million votes and
former Taiwan Governor James Soong's 4.6 million votes.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) announced
Wednesday the results of two public opinion polls that decided which
of two candidates will represent the party in the year-end election
for Kaohsiung County chief.</P>
      <P>Legislator Wu Kuang-hsun received an average of 2.3 percentage
points higher in the polls than former Fengshan Mayor Huang Pa-yeh to
become the official KMT-endorsed nominee.</P>
      <P>Wu said that he still hopes to be able to work together with
Huang in the future to help the KMT reclaim the county, which has
been tightly held by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party for 16
years.</P>
      <P>However, Huang said after congratulating Wu that he will look
over the poll numbers again in detail and will not rule out insisting
on running for county chief if he discovers for certain that the
numbers were questionable.</P>
      <P>Each of the two candidates appointed a company to conduct a poll
that began 6 p.m. Tuesday and ended Wednesday noon.</P>
      <P>Out of the 1,032 effective samples obtained by the company that
Wu appointed, 37.4 percent of the respondents said that they support
Wu, while 35.6 percent supported Huang.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Guinness world record holder for the
most number of countries traversed on foot completed his 27th
conquest Wednesday when he arrived at the southern-most tip of
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>For his latest feat, Steven Newman, 47, received an official
certificate from a representative of the Guinness Book of Records at
the Oluanpi Lighthouse in Pingtung County, the final stop of his
534-kilometer trip that began Sept. 23 from the island's
northern-most tip.</P>
      <P>Newman, who hails from a small town in Ohio in the United States,
said that he has witnessed the friendliness of the Taiwanese people
on several occasions during the course of his journey.</P>
      <P>He said that while he was walking along western Taiwan, many
people along the way gave him water and "moon cakes," a traditional
Chinese snack eaten on the Mid-Autumn Festival, which fell on Oct. 1
this year -- the 15th day of the eighth month on the lunar calender.</P>
      <P>Newman is bringing home three gifts from Taiwan that he said he
will treasure. One is a stone carving of a cicada given to him by a
sculptor in southern Taiwan's Kaohsiung County.</P>
      <P>Another is a box of betel nuts that he said he wants to bring
home to his wife, who is a school teacher, so that she can let her
students taste the so-called "Taiwanese bubblegum."</P>
      <P>The third is a badge from a local McDonald's, because he said
that he frequently ate at the fast food chain during the 18 days he
spent in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He said that he will rest for a while before deciding whether to
traverse Hong Kong, Vietnam or mainland China on foot next year.</P>
      <P>Newman made his world record of traversing 24 countries on foot
in 1987 after three years of traveling. He spent three-and-a-half
months last year walking from the northern-most tip of Japan to its
southern-most tip and completed a similar trip across South Korea in
June this year.</P>

(By David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's Chinese Petroleum Corp. (CPC) and
mainland Chinese China National Offshore Oil Corp. (CNOOC) will
probably form a joint venture in Hong Kong or Singapore to explore
for oil in the Taiwan Strait, CPC sources said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The sources said that the CPC board of directors will discuss and
finalize the project Friday and then forward it for approval to the
Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Mainland Affairs Council.</P>
      <P>The CPC, using the name "Overseas Petroleum and Investment
Corp.," signed an agreement with the CNOOC in 1998 to engage in the
preliminary exploration for oil under the waters west of the Tainan
Basin, southern Taiwan, and east of mainland Chinese Chaozhou and
Shantou areas.</P>
      <P>After preliminary explorations, both sides estimated that there
are oil reserves of about 1,334.6 billion cubic meters in the area.</P>
      <P>CPC ranking officials said that as they are restricted by
Taiwan's current "no haste, be patient" policy toward mainland China,
the CPC and the CNOOC suggest that both sides set up a joint venture
in a third country, thereby allowing further oil exploration in the
area.</P>

    <DATELINE>Washington,  Oct.  10  (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>U.S. Representative Tom DeLay on
Tuesday urged Beijing to invite Republic of China President Chen
Shui-bian to attend the upcoming informal leadership summit of the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum in Shanghai.</P>
      <P>The Texas Republican said during a speech he delivered at the
U.S. House of Representatives that mainland China can lower
Taipei-Beijing tensions and start constructive bilateral exchanges
through this act of good will.</P>
      <P>DeLay, who is the Republican whip, said that the people of the
world will be able to determine from the APEC summit to be held Oct.
20-21 whether Beijing allows all APEC members to fully participate in
jointly promoting trade and intra-regional economic development.</P>
      <P>He said that Beijing still has the opportunity to show the world
that it is sincerely willing to resolve its differences with Taiwan
by inviting Chen to the meeting.</P>
      <P>DeLay said that the key to resolving the tension across the
Taiwan Strait is by engaging in wide-ranging and open dialogue on
affairs of mutual importance.</P>
      <P>Last month, 30 members of the U.S. House of Representatives
endorsed a resolution supporting Chen's full participation in the
APEC summit meeting.</P>
      <P>The resolution, introduced on July 24, was referred to the U.S.
House Committee on International Relations for further action.</P>
      <P>The non-binding resolution says that the U.S. Congress supports
the initiatives proposed for direct dialogue without precondition
between leaders from both sides of the Taiwan Strait, and
"specifically endorses the proposal for full participation" in the
APEC forum by President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>Chen has appointed former Vice President Li Yuan-zu to represent
him at the upcoming meeting.</P>
      <P>APEC, a regional forum dedicated to promoting free trade and
investment, is one of the few international organizations that has as
its members both sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>However, because of mainland China's opposition, the ROC
president has been barred from attending the annual APEC summits in
person and has had to name a proxy to attend in his stead.</P>
      <P>Although Chen has repeatedly expressed his desire to attend the
Shanghai summit, Beijing has declined to make any exceptions
regarding its position on the issue.</P>
      <P>Yielding to international realities, Chen finally came to a
decision Tuesday to name Li as his proxy.</P>
      <P>APEC members are Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, mainland
China, South Korea, the United States, the Philippines, Hong Kong,
Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea,
Peru, Russia, Singapore, Thailand, Taiwan and Vietnam.</P>

served as president of National Cheng Chi University, justice
minister and education minister before serving as vice president

interview with the ROC premier and carried it in its Oct. 10 issue,
the same day that the ROC celebrates its Double Ten National Day, is
of special significance, said some local political observers.</P>
      <P>Chang said that although it is true Taiwan is facing an
unprecedented economic downturn amid sluggishness in the global
economy, there is no reason to worry that a financial crisis will
occur in Taiwan as the country possesses high levels of foreign
exchange reserves while the government has implemented sweeping
measures to reform and streamline Taiwan's financial system.</P>
      <P>He said that the ROC government is aiming at seeking a balance
between economic development and environment conservation in order to
achieve sustained development.</P>
      <P>Chang defended the Chen administration's decision to follow a new
strategy of "active opening, effective management" toward Taiwan
trade and investment in mainland China instead of the "no haste, be
patient" tactics, saying that the new approach is aimed at increasing
Taiwan's competitiveness in the global trade arena, rather than just
in the area of the cross-Taiwan Strait trade.</P>
      <P>According to Chang, bilateral trade between Taiwan and Russia has
increased on a year-on-year basis, with the total amount of trade
between the two sides reaching US$1.565 billion in 2000.</P>
      <P>Computers, PC peripherals, and stereo and audio systems and
equipment made up the bulk of Taiwan's exports to Russia last year,
while metal raw materials were the major commodities that Russia
exported to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Taiwan suffered a trade deficit of US$1.193 billion with Russia
in 2000. Commenting on the trade imbalance, Chang said it should be
addressed by increasing Taiwan exports to Russia, rather than by
cutting imports from Russia.</P>
      <P>In related news, Taiwan's chief representative in Moscow, Charles
Shu-chi King, played host at a dinner party Wednesday evening marking
the Republic of China's 90th birthday, with dignitaries from Russia's
political and business circles as well as from the Chinese and Taiwan
business communities participating.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOST TECHNOLOGY BARONS IN TAIWAN FACING SHRINKAGE IN WEALTH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 11 (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A recent survey by Business Weekly magazine
showed that major shareholders of Taiwan's listed high-technology
firms have suffered great losses in wealth over the past year due to
the declining stock market.</P>
      <P>The survey conducted in September showed that among the 100 most
wealthy individuals in Taiwan's hi-tech sector, 87 reported that
their wealth and assets shrank in the past 12 months, and the losses
ranged between 20 percent and 80 percent.</P>
      <P>Kuo Tai-ming, chairman of Hou Hai Precision Industry, remained
the most wealthy hi-tech baron in Taiwan, although the market
capitalization of his stocks amounted to only NT$50.9 billion at the
end of September, down 48 percent from the level a year earlier.</P>
      <P>Quanta Computer chairman Lin Pai-li, with wealth amounting to
NT$49.1 billion, ranked second. As of the end of September, seven
hi-tech executives in Taiwan were in the NT$10 billion wealth club.</P>
      <P>While the newly listed hi-tech corporations have created several
new wealthy individuals during the past several months, some stock
market champs of previous years when the market was bullish were
experiencing bitter setbacks. Some of them even failed to keep their
places on the top-100 chart.</P>
      <P>An analyst of China Securities Investment Trust Corp. said that
in the 1990s, major shareholders of some electronics firms had
pledged their stocks for bank loans to raise capital for
reinvestments. While the booming prospect had served as a stimulus to
share prices, market capitalization of these corporations continued
to expand.</P>
      <P>However, the adverse turn in the stock market's fortunes has put
these shareholders in a dilemma, with most facing a depreciation in
the value of their stocks and many having difficulties cashing out of
their stocks on hand to repay the bank loans, he added.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Few Taiwan people support the proposal that
the Republic of China send troops to assist the United States in its
current war on global terrorism, according to the results of an
opinion poll released Thursday.</P>
      <P>The telephone poll of 1,124 randomly chosen adult residents,
conducted by Open magazine from Oct. 8-10, found that only 1.17
percent support sending troops to join the U.S.-led military strikes
on Afghanistan for its sheltering of Osama bin Laden, the suspected
mastermind behind the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in the United
States.</P>
      <P>About 52 percent of the respondents said they don't think that
Taiwan should dispatch its service people to assist in the ongoing
anti-terrorism war, while 31 percent said they think Taiwan can offer
military logistic aid.</P>
      <P>The same survey also found that 32.5 percent of those interviewed
are willing to accept the Beijing-proposed "one country, two systems"
unification scheme, but 61.06 percent said Beijing's unification
formula is unacceptable.</P>
      <P>As for the approval ratings of major domestic political parties,
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) continues to take the
lead, with a support rate of 21.93 percent; followed by the
Kuomintang at 15.4 percent; the People First Party at 13.52 percent;
the Taiwan Solidarity Union at 1.52 percent; and the New Party at
1.25 percent.</P>
      <P>Asked about their self-identity, 46.54 percent said they perceive
themselves as Taiwanese; 10.96 percent said they identify themselves
as Chinese; 28.39 percent said they identify themselves as both
Taiwanese and Chinese; 12.22 percent said they perceive themselves as
both Chinese and Taiwanese; and 69.01 percent said they agree to be
called ethnic Chinese.</P>
      <P>Turning to the question about future relations between Taiwan and
mainland China, 40.81 percent said they think that the status quo
should be maintained forever; 15.95 percent said they prefer to see
Taiwan gradually move toward independence after maintaining the
status quo for some time; and 26.67 percent said they think that
Taiwan should gradually reunite with the mainland after maintaining
the status quo for some time.</P>

(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An opening of Taiwan's telecommunications
market will affect the island's economic development and national
security, according to a research report released Thursday by the
Institute of Transportation of the Ministry of Transportation and
Communications.</P>
      <P>The report indicates that Taiwan has gradually opened its
telecommunications market to meet the requirements for World Trade
Organization (WTO) membership.</P>
      <P>While WTO membership will provide advantages for the local
telecommunications sector to operate international businesses, the
research report cautions about the risk of capital outflow. The high
potential of the telecommunications service market in mainland China
is seen as a strong magnet for foreign capital and a big attraction
to Taiwan's investors, according to the report.</P>
      <P>After joining the WTO, Taiwan's telecommunications market will be
open to foreign investors and foreign workers, including those from
mainland China.</P>
      <P>The research report points out that Taiwan's telecommunications
sector and communication networks may be at risk of being monitored
by the authorities on mainland China, unless security measures are
adopted before the liberalization of the market.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Finance has submitted a
proposal to the Executive Yuan suggesting that the government help
companies with normal operations and good credit to postpone the
repayment of bank loans, Wang Ling-lin, chairman of the General
Chamber of Commerce of the ROC, said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Officials of business and industrial associations met with
economic and financial officials Thursday morning to study rescue
measures for business firms who had suffered great losses from
typhoons and floods.</P>
      <P>Jeffrey Koo, chairman of the Chinese Association of Industry and
Commerce, said that a prolonged military conflict in Central Asia
will delay the anticipated world economic recovery by three to six
months, thus causing difficulties to the capital-rigid business and
industrial circles in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He called on the government to help reschedule loan repayments
for those businesses with normal operations and good credit.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Finance Wednesday afternoon convened a special
meeting on the possible rescheduling of loan repayments and a

the possibility of allowing private enterprises to postpone the
repayments by one year. The authorities agreed to study the
feasibility of the proposal.</P>
      <P>The business leaders said that the government should adopt
measures to help small and medium-sized businesses counter the
difficulties triggered by the shrinkage of export markets. They also
cautioned the authorities to prevent dumping of imported goods before
Taiwan is admitted into the World Trade Organization.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  11  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Media celebrity Sisy Chen registered for
the Dec. 1 legislative elections in metropolitan Taipei's southern
precinct Thursday, the last day for candidacy registration for the
pivotal polls.</P>
      <P>Chen, who once served as spokeswoman for the Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) when it was still an opposition party,
registered her candidacy as an independent.</P>
      <P>"Running for a legislative seat is one of the most difficult
decisions to make in my life," Chen said, adding that she came to a
final decision after much soul searching.</P>
      <P>Accompanied by two friends, Chen arrived at the Taipei City
Election Commission at 11:40 a.m. to register her candidacy,
immediately causing a stir among media professionals at the
commission's office.</P>
      <P>Chen, known for her outspokenness and maverick thinking, said she
intends to serve for only one legislative term. She further said that
if she is elected to the Legislative Yuan, she would donate all of
the salary to educational institutions that are dedicated to offering
vocational training for unemployed blue-collar workers.</P>
      <P>Chen reminded those who expect her to make promotional
appearances if she is elected, such as private social functions and
wedding ceremonies or funerals, should not vote for her. If elected,
Chen said she would focus on policy debates and policy initiatives
instead of wasting time on trivial publicity events.</P>
      <P>Chen said she has no plans to distribute any campaign leaflets,
not to mention offering any gifts to voters. A clean election would
be the first step to establish a new legislative culture and
political tradition in Taiwan, she noted.</P>
      <P>Chen paid NT$200,000 in cash as a deposit for her candidacy. She
was surprised when a registration office staffer told her that one
NT$1,000 bill in the money she gave was counterfeit. "It's really
disappointing. My mother directly transferred the money to me after
she received the money from a bank teller this morning," she said.</P>
      <P>Chen's participation in the race would add to fanfare in the
Taipei south precinct competition as all major domestic political
parties have already fielded a number of noted politicians, including
many incumbents, to run for the 10 regional seats up for grabs.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LAWMAKER PUSHES FOR MANDATORY SUPPORT OF ELDERLY BY ADULT CHILDREN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  11 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislator Lai Shyh-bao of the opposition
New Party Thursday proposed legislation that would require adult
children to provide care for their elderly parents.</P>
      <P>Lai said he initiated the proposal after learning of a great
number of cases where adult children abandoned their aged parents,
often leaving them sick and helpless.</P>
      <P>According to Lai, the 14-article "parents' support" draft bill
precisely stipulates that attending or waiting on elderly parents is
the responsibility of all children. It also stipulates the criteria
for adult children to support their parents, particularly when they
are old and ill, Lai noted.</P>
      <P>He added that violators of the bill would face fines as high as
NT$200,000 (US$5,797) or one year in prison.</P>
      <P>According to Lai, the number of Taiwan citizens who are 65 years
old or older stood at around 1.94 million at the end of June. The
figure represented 8.43 percent of the island's total population,
exceeding the benchmark 7 percent level, making Taiwan's society a
"gray nation," he added.</P>
      <P>Lai estimated that there are about 150,000 senior citizens in
Taiwan who are poor, unattended or even displaced. He made the
judgment based on government tallies showing that 8.97 percent of the
people who are aged 65 or above, or about 174,000 senior citizens,
are bracketed as people of low incomes who regularly need financial
help.</P>
      <P>Lai quoted government tallies as indicating that in Taiwan, an
elderly person needs at least NT$16,000 (US$464) a month to survive,
assuming that they are healthy. However, there are some 739,000
elderly citizens at present living on less than NT$6,000 every month,
Lai said.</P>
      <P>The tallies also showed that about 47 percent of the island's
senior citizens are being taken care of in some way by their adult
children.</P>
      <P>Commenting on Lai's proposal, Tsai Huang-liang, Democratic
Progressive Party whip at the Legislative Yuan, said that the draft
bill was a worthy and respectable effort deserving the full support
of all legislators.</P>
      <P>Tsai said he hopes that the draft bill will be passed and
promulgated this session.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER SIGNS ORGAN DONOR CARD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  11 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung signed an organ
donor card Thursday as part of an effort to raise the consciousness
of the program in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The signing was part of activities launched by the Cabinet-level
Department of Health aiming at allowing the concept of organ donation
to take root in Taiwan over the next three years.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan passed an amendment to the Organ Donation Act
Thursday, paralleling the launch of a three-year nationwide organ
donation campaign.</P>
      <P>The health department is aiming at sponsoring 300 briefing
workshops a year islandwide to promote organ donation in the country.</P>
      <P>Chang said one person out of every three people in the United
States has been shown to be willing to donate their organs, as
compared with one out of every 60 people in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He added that last year, some 6,000 patients in Taiwan were
waiting for donated organs for transplants to survive. Only 100
people obtained such transplants. Most of the waiting patients died
because of a lack of donated organs.</P>
      <P>Department of Health Director-General Lee Ming-liang joined Chang
in the donor card signing drive. Lee said some prisoners on death row
have agreed to donate their organs over the past several years, but
the number of their donations are relatively few compared with the
number of people who need an organ transplant.</P>
      <P>Lee said thousands of people are killed in traffic accidents
every year but most of them do not think about donating their organs
while they are alive. Lee said that more people should consider
signing a donor card while they are still healthy.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislator Lin Chih-chia of the opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) registered Thursday to run for re-election as an
independent despite saying earlier that he was withdrawing from
politics.</P>
      <P>Lin, with tears in his eyes, said he had in fact intended to quit
politics to pursue advanced studies, but said that he could not let
down his die-hard supporters. Lin came forward on the last day of
registration and decided to run as an independent since the KMT had
not recommended that he run on its ticket.</P>
      <P>Saying that he wanted to continue to work in the Legislative Yuan
for the benefit of children and underprivileged groups, Lin said he
was prepared to accept any recriminations that he may get from the
KMT.</P>
      <P>Lin was originally KMT candidate for Taipei County magistrate,
but later agreed to abide by an opinion poll to decide whether he or
Wang Chien-shien of the New Party, should represent the "pan-blue
alliance" in the election to boost the chances of winning against
incumbent Taipei County Magistrate Su Tseng-chang of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>Lin, after losing by a statistically insignificant margin of 0.28
percent to Wang in the poll, agreed to take his hat out of the ring,
and said that he would throw his full support behind Wang. He also
said that he would withdraw from politics and would not run for
magistrate or legislator.</P>
      <P>The "pan-blue alliance" refers to the alliance between the KMT,
currently the opposition party with the most seats in the Legislative
Yuan, and its two splinter groups -- the People First Party and the
New Party. The three parties share a roughly common pro-unification
stance on relations with mainland China in contrast to the ruling
DPP's pro-independence position.</P>
      <P>Wang said he welcomed Lin's decision to enter the race for
re-election, but some KMT legislators condemned the action.</P>
      <P>Wang said that both he and Lin should do well in their respective
campaigns, adding that since they will represent the "pan-blue
alliance," their efforts to attract votes should be complementary.
Wang said he had relatively less support in the second of the three
election precincts in Taipei County, and Lin's registration in the
second precinct will certainly strengthen Wang.</P>
      <P>Several of the five KMT candidates running in the second precinct
said that Lin's entering the race will affect their own election
bids. Ten legislators will be elected in the second precinct of
Taipei County.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Chen Hung-chang -- one of the five KMT candidates
-- said that if the KMT should decide to recommend Lin, it would
compromise the party's credibility, and if Lin goes through with his
bid as an independent, he would compromise his own credibility.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Lee Sen-zong also said that democracy means that no
one can interfere with the right to enter politics, but said he
regretted that Lin had come out in support of him only last week but
is now in the race himself.</P>
      <P>Lee said that political figures should be models for society,
indirectly criticizing Lin for changing horses in midstream by going
back on his word to quit politics after withdrawing from the race for
magistrate.</P>

    <HEADLINE>HUANG PA-YEH REGISTERS FOR COUNTY CHIEF ELECTION AFTER POLLS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  11  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Huang Pa-yeh, a member of the main
opposition Kuomintang, registered Thursday as an independent
candidate in the Dec. 1 election for Kaohsiung County magistrate.</P>
      <P>The KMT announced Wednesday the results of two public opinion
polls that decided which of two candidates would represent the party
in the year-end election for Kaohsiung County chief.</P>
      <P>Huang said that he had hoped the polls would help solve the
stalemate between himself and Wu Kuang-hsun, a candidate endorsed by
the KMT, but as the polls "were rigged and could not convince me,"
Huang said that he would not follow through with the agreements made
before the polls.</P>
      <P>Legislator Wu Kuang-hsun received an average of 2.3 percentage
points higher in the polls than former Fengshan Mayor Huang to become
the official KMT-endorsed nominee.</P>
      <P>On questions that Huang's insistence to run in the election will
compromise his credibility since he had agreed beforehand that he
would respect the poll results, Huang said that the two public
opinion poll companies used different samples, and the questions that
were asked were "misleading," so that he could not accept the result
of the polls.</P>
      <P>Huang stressed that he had announced his withdrawal from the KMT
Wednesday night and registered as an independent. Calling the opinion
surveys nothing more than straw polls, Huang said that there was no
more room to compromise with the KMT.</P>
      <P>Huang was accompanied by legislator Chung Shao-ho of the People
First Party to register. Both Huang and Chung earlier sought to
represent the "pan-blue alliance" to run for Kaohsiung magistrate,
and agreed to let a public poll decide who should run. Results
showed that Huang led in the polls. Chung bowed out of the race and
re-entered in the legislative race later.</P>
      <P>As the KMT had not approved of the polls to decide the candidate,
Wu didn't take part. Wednesday's public polls were a last-ditch
attempt by the KMT to solve the stalemate between Wu and Huang. Both
are adamant to run to the very end against Yang Chiu-hsing of the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party.</P>
      <P>Wu stressed that the process of the polls was simple and just,
and he believes that justice has been done, adding that he would no
longer consult with Huang.</P>
      <P>Wu regretted that Huang had proposed the polls and reneged on his
commitment after the results.</P>

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The financial sector of 15 countries,
including Taiwan, has come under increased pressure, a report made
public Wednesday by Standard &amp; Poor's shows.</P>
      <P>It is the fifth such analysis released by Standard &amp; Poor's since
1997. It surveyed 68 countries. In addition to Taiwan, Argentina,
mainland China, Cyprus, Egypt, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Japan,
Lebanon, Holland, Portugal, Thailand, Turkey and the United States
were named in the report by the international rating agency on the
pressure facing the global financial sector in 2001.</P>
      <P>Despite the fact that different countries are in different
situations, Michael DeStefano, a Standard &amp; Poor's manager, said he
made the analysis based on the common factors existing in these
countries while paying attention to some major indicators such as
sovereign credit, private-sector debts, and surges in assets prices.</P>
      <P>Other elements, such as the banking sector's failure to conduct
reforms, inadequate government interference, a weak economic
structure, and a lack of monitoring, were also involved, DeStefano
said.</P>
      <P>In the United States, a sharp rise in bank loans and an economic
slowdown are indications that the prospects of the U.S. banking
system are bleak, according to the report. In Japan, it warned that a
move by the Japanese government to bail out banking systems with
public money could hinder Japan's AA+ sovereign credit rating.</P>
      <P>The report did not elaborate on the situation in Taiwan.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  11  (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China Navy Fleet Command
announced Thursday that one of its submarines had run aground after
executing an evasive maneuver during a military exercise last week,
but the damaged sonar dome has been repaired.</P>
      <P>According to the navy, the Hai Hu ("Sea Tiger") diesel-electric
submarine was engaged in a live-confrontation drill Oct. 2 in waters
off of southwestern Taiwan when it made a tactical roundabout
deep-dive at a depth of 150 meters and scraped a protruding area of
the sea floor.</P>
      <P>Inspections back at the submarine's home port revealed that the
starboard sonar dome was "slightly indented, scraped and cracked."
Repairs on the Dutch-built Zwaardvis-class ("Swordfish") vessel were
made at a dry dock.</P>
      <P>The navy reported no injuries as a result of the accident.</P>
      <P>Commissioned in 1988, the Hai Hu is one of only four submarines
in the service of the ROC Navy and carries a complement of 67 crew
members.</P>
      <P>The 2,660-ton vessel has a sister ship called the Hai Lung ("Sea
Dragon"). Both are based in southern Taiwan's Tsoying Port.</P>
      <P>The other two ROC submarines belong to the venerable U.S.-made
Guppy class.</P>
      <P>Earlier this year, the U.S. administration agreed to provide
Taiwan with eight diesel-electric patrol submarines through its
foreign military sales program.</P>
      <P>A delivery date is as yet unknown because U.S. shipyards no
longer build diesel-electric submarines and would have to acquire
blueprints from other countries.</P>

      <P>Republic of China Premier Chang Chun-hsiung
reiterated Thursday that the government is determined to crack down

    <HEADLINE>LAWMAKER ACCUSED OF ASSAULT IN LEGISLATURE GIVES UP RE-ELECTION BID</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  11  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Independent legislator Lo Fu-chu, who is
widely believed to be the "spiritual leader" of the Heavenly Way
Alliance gang, announced Thursday that he would not seek re-election
to the new Legislative Yuan to be elected Dec. 1.</P>
      <P>Lo made the announcement in a written statement on the last day
of candidacy registration for the pivotal polls, which will determine
whether the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) can gain
additional legislative seats to help it to govern more effectively.</P>
      <P>Lo's announcement also came on the eve of the expiration of a
six-month suspension of his legislative duties, which he self-imposed
after his assault of a female colleague in March. Lo has an extensive
history of using his fists rather than his intellect to conduct
legislative business.</P>
      <P>Lo, a two-term lawmaker, said in his statement that he is
remorseful for his past thuggish behavior on the legislative floor.
He further said he has come to understand that being a legislator is
not the only way to make a real contribution to society and the
nation.</P>
      <P>"Therefore, I have decided not to take part in the upcoming
legislative elections and I will devote the rest of my life to
charity or things that would benefit the general public," Lo said,
adding that his passion for serving the people and society will
remain unchanged after ending his current legislative term.</P>
      <P>Lo's announcement came as a surprise to many of his legislative
colleagues.</P>
      <P>DPP legislator Shen Fu-hsiung said he believes that Lo's
withdrawal will help make the upcoming elections cleaner than ever
and will also mark the beginning of legislative reforms.</P>
      <P>Just last week, Shen vowed to join forces with the four DPP
nominees to run in Taipei's southern precinct to block Lo's
re-election bid. Lo moved his legal abode to the metropolitan Taipei
precinct earlier this year from Taipei County in an attempt to run
for another legislative term in the district.</P>
      <P>Shen, a physician-turned-lawmaker, said he believes that Lo
certainly must have made a prudent calculation of his chances before
deciding to abandon his re-election bid. In his view, Shen said Lo's
chances of winning a new term was "less-than-certain" as the campaign
gimmicks he used in Taipei County would not necessarily be useful in
metropolitan Taipei.</P>
      <P>Some other lawmakers said Lo was deeply frustrated by the Taipei
Prosecutor's Office decision earlier this week to indict him for his
assault on People First Party Legislator Diane Lee in March and to
ask police authorities to list him as a "hooligan" to be subject to
reformatory education. "This might be a decisive factor in Lo's
decision to quit politics," said a legislator who preferred
anonymity.</P>
      <P>Last Wednesday, Lo harangued and intimidated members of the
legislature's finance committee for one hour simply because the DPP
legislative caucus had questioned the validity of electing his son Lo
Ming-tsai as convener of the committee. The junior Lo, also a
legislator, was elected to the committee's convener seat early
this month for a third consecutive term, breaking an internal rule of
the chamber that forbids any lawmaker serving as a convener of any
committee for three straight sessions. The senior Lo's invective
halted the committee's plan to conduct a new run of convener
elections on that day.</P>
      <P>The controversy surrounding his son's convenership might also be
a factor prompting Lo to decide to forsake his re-election bid, some
lawmakers said.</P>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan graduates may soon have to face
fierce competition from their mainland Chinese counterparts and they
had better be prepared for the coming changes, a magazine that
provides information on job opportunities cautioned Friday.</P>
      <P>Chang Sheng-yuan, editor-in-chief of the monthly Career, said
that in such sought-after jobs in the fields of information, finance
and business management, the average monthly pay for a mainland
college graduate is 2,000 renminbi per month, or just over NT$8,000,
but in Taiwan, a college graduate could get between NT$30,000 and
NT35,000 a month.</P>
      <P>The monthly reported that more than 60 percent of Taiwan students
could pass college entrance examinations, while there are more than
four million students in the mainland hoping to squeeze into colleges
and universities in a much more fierce examination.</P>
      <P>Nine Taiwan universities specializing in certain areas of
research have received a subsidie of NT$720 million each this year,
but only Beijing University and Tsinghua University have received
subsidies amounting to 1.8 billion (NT$7.5 billion) renminbi over a
three-year period, Chang said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan universities have also not been rigorous in asking college
students to improve their English, while in mainland China, college
students have to pass an equivalent of a TOFEL test above 550 points
to be able to graduate.</P>
      <P>Chang said that if young men in Taiwan are willing to work on the
mainland, they will have more chances in Taiw an businesses investing
in the mainland, noting that this is because Taiwan businesses are
not so famous on the mainland and their images are not too good, and
elite students on the mainland are still unwilling to work in Taiwan
businesses.</P>
      <P>Chang also said that Taiwan students may not have to face direct
competition from their mainland counterparts in the next two years,
but in the future, in the greater Chinese economy, it may be
inevitable that young men that share the same language and culture on
the two sides of the Taiwan Strait may become rivals.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN MAKES LIMITED PROGRESS IN PROTECTION OF LABOR RIGHTS: REPORT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Brussels,   Oct.   10   (CNA)
(By P.C. Tang and Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's government has adopted
encouraging steps to further protect labor rights, however, the
progress is not sufficient in the eyes of the International
Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU).</P>
      <P>According to a recent ICFTU investigation report about violations
against unions rights among a total of 140 countries, Taiwan's ruling
Democratic Progressive Party has relaxed restrictions on forming
unions, and has admitted three more nationwide labor organizations
since it took power in May last year.</P>
      <P>However, the report says, Taiwan's laws permits indirect
intervention by the government on labor unions' interior issues,
citing as an example the government's ability to dismiss any labor
union whose activities disrupt social order.</P>
      <P>Although a court ruling in 1995 said that the right to form a
union by the people is guaranteed by the Constitution, until now
Taiwan's public servants, teachers, officials related to the national
defense industry are still not allowed to form unions, the report
adds.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, there are still many restrictions on strikes that make
even legal walkouts very difficult and harm the rights of collective
negotiations, the report said.</P>
      <P>Because of the lack of legislation, Taiwan still lacks sufficient
protection against discrimination against labor unions, according to
the report.</P>
      <P>The report also accuses many Taiwan companies doing business
abroad of violating laws and labor rights of the countries in which
they invest, mainly in Central America, the Caribbean, South Africa
and southeastern African countries. Because of these enterprises,
Taiwan's reputation has been hampered among world labor-rights
protection organizations.</P>
      <P>The report also indicated that 209 labor union members were
killed last year throughout the world, with Asia being the region
that violated the most labor rights.</P>
      <P>The Brussels-based ICFTU has 221 affiliates in 140 countries,
with more than 156 million members around the world. Taiwan is one of
its official members.</P>
      <P>Aside from the close cooperation with the International Labor
Organization, an affiliate of the United Nations, the ICFTU is also a
consulting agency for many U.N. social and economic commissions.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP MIGHT WIN OVER 80 SEATS IN LEGISLATIVE ELECTION: DPP LEADER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  11 (CNA)
(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
Secretary-General Wu Nai-jen predicted Thursday that the DPP and the
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) are likely to win over 80 seats each in
the Dec. 1 legislative election.</P>
      <P>Speaking to reporters at the close of the three-day registration
period for the election of lawmakers, county magistrates and city
mayors, he based his prediction on the results of a recent
DPP-commissioned public opinion survey.</P>
      <P>He added that the People First Party (PFP) could get 35 seats,
five seats each could be won by the New Party and the newly
established Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU), with 10 seats going to
independent candidates.</P>
      <P>Of the seats for the DPP and the KMT, Wu said that 19 seats each
will come from the seats allocated for the nationwide constituency
and for overseas Chinese residents.</P>
      <P>He added that the PFP is likely to acquire 11 seats in these
areas, while the New Party and the TSU might have no seats from these
portions because their ballots might fail to reach the required 5
percent of the total ballots.</P>
      <P>Regarding the elections for county magistrates and city mayors,
Wu said that the DPP might enjoy the lead in 10 counties -- Taipei,

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN ANALYST PREDICTS INFORMATION HARDWARE NEGATIVE GROWTH IN 2002</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 11 (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A local analyst predicted Thursday that the
annual growth in production value for the global information hardware
industry next year will be between 1 percent and minus 10 percent.</P>
      <P>Market Intelligence Center (MIC) Director Chan Wen-nan said that
the most optimistic forecast for Taiwan's own information hardware
industry is between 4 percent and 5 percent, while the most
pessimistic number is between minus 2 percent to minus 3 percent.</P>
      <P>He added that "next year will definitely be better than this
year."</P>
      <P>Chan said that the MIC, a division of the Institute for
Information Industry, had originally estimated that the annual growth
in production value for the local information hardware industry would
be minus 8 percent this year.</P>
      <P>However, he continued, after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on
America, the MIC adjusted that figure down to between minus 11
percent and minus 12 percent.</P>
      <P>The U.S.-led attacks on the Taliban regime in Afghanistan have
further led the MIC to adjust the growth figure even further to minus
15 percent, he said, bringing the total estimated production value
for 2001 down to US$33.4 billion -- approximately the same level as
it was in 1999.</P>
      <P>A number of hardware industries that were originally estimated to
be capable of growing by 100 percent or more in production value have
also been affected. The annual growth rate in the production value of
digital cameras, liquid crystal displays and servers made in Taiwan
have been downward adjusted to between 60 percent and 70 percent.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  11 (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Central Election Commission announced
Thursday that a total of 458 hopefuls have signed up to run for the
168 regional legislative seats and eight aboriginal legislative seats
around the country in the Dec. 1 elections.</P>
      <P>The commission added that another 90 hopefuls have signed up to
run for the 23 available county chief and city mayor positions in the
elections, meaning that only 25.55 percent of the candidates will
emerge victorious.</P>
      <P>Only 38.42 percent of the legislative candidates will be elected
to the 225-seat Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>The remaining seats will be partially filled by 41
legislators-at-large, to be determined according to a system of
proportional representation among the various political parties. The
more seats that a party wins in the regional legislative elections,
the more legislator-at-large seats it gains.</P>
      <P>In addition to the 41 legislators-at-large, eight other seats are
reserved for overseas Chinese representatives who will be elected
according to the same formula for proportional representation among
political parties.</P>
      <P>Twelve out of 97 registered political parties nominated a total
of 325 candidates to run in the regional legislative elections and
the aboriginal district legislative elections. Independent candidates
and candidates who were running without their party's support
accounted for another 133 sign-ups.</P>
      <P>The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) nominated 98 candidates to run in
the regional legislative elections, followed by the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) with 83 candidates, the opposition People
First Party (PFP) with 61 candidates, the Taiwan Solidarity Union
(TSU) with 39 candidates and the opposition New Party (NP) with 33
candidates.</P>
      <P>The seven remaining parties have nominated fewer than three
candidates each.</P>
      <P>Five political parties nominated a total of 53 candidates in the
running for county chiefs and city mayors, while another 37
candidates were running on their own without the backing of a party.</P>
      <P>The KMT fielded 23 candidates to run for county chiefs and city
mayors, the DPP chose 22 candidates, the PFP selected six candidates,
the NP picked one candidate and the Green Party backed one candidate.</P>
      <P>The KMT also nominated 39 legislator-at-large candidates and
eight overseas legislator candidates, while the DPP nominated 23
legislator-at-large candidates and five overseas legislator
candidates.</P>
      <P>The KMT originally nominated 41 legislator-at-large candidates,
but Chang Ming-chih, who ranked 28th on the list, and Lin Hui-kuan,
who ranked 34th, decided not to accept their nominations.</P>
      <P>Lin, who is president of the Chinese Federation of Labor, had
accepted a nomination to rank fifth on the PFP list.</P>
      <P>The list's arrangement of order indicates the party's order of
preference and will therefore affect the candidates' chances of
becoming legislators-at-large in the elections.</P>
      <P>The PFP nominated 23 legislator-at-large candidates and five
overseas legislator candidates, the TSU nominated 15
legislator-at-large candidates and one overseas legislator candidate,
and the NP nominated eight legislator-at-large candidates and two
overseas legislator candidates.</P>
      <P>For the first time in the Republic of China's election history,
two political party chairmen were included on the lists submitted to
the Central Election Commission for legislator-at-large candidates.</P>
      <P>PFP Chairman James Soong, who is a former Taiwan provincial
governor, was entered on the PFP legislator-at-large candidates list
in 11th spot, while TSU Chairman Huang Chu-wen, who is a former
interior minister, was included on the TSU list in 15th place.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A ranking official of the opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) said Thursday that the KMT might remain the nation's
biggest party after the Dec. 1 legislative election.</P>
      <P>Chao Shou-po, chairman of the KMT Organizational Development
Committee, said that 97 candidates will run for election in regional
constituencies on the KMT ticket, 66 of whom are incumbent
legislators, while 31 others are new faces.</P>
      <P>Besides the candidates for the regional constituencies, the KMT
also nominated 39 candidates for the 41 seats allocated for the
nationwide constituency and named eight others to vie for the eight
seats for overseas Chinese legislators.</P>
      <P>Chao predicted that the KMT will win about 90 seats in the
legislative election to retain its status at the largest party in the
225-seat Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>However, ruling Democratic Progressive Party Secretary-General Wu
Nai-jen said that the DPP and the KMT might win 80 seats each in the
election, which will be the first major election since the DPP won
the March 18, 2000 presidential election.</P>
      <P>As it is unlikely that any single party will win a simple
majority in the election, President Chen Shui-bian has stated that
regardless of the results of the election, he will form a coalition
government after the election.</P>
      <P>Regarding the elections for county magistrates and city mayors,
the KMT nominated 23 candidates and the DPP nominated 22 candidates
during the three-day registration period that ended that day.</P>
      <P>The KMT hopes to win in seven counties -- Taoyuan, Hsinchu,
Taichung, Changhua, Yunlin, Chiayi and Tainan -- and in the cities of

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER CHANG EXTENDS GREETINGS TO BEDRIDDEN `YOUNG MARSHAL'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 12 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Premier Chang Chun-hsiung
extended his greetings Friday via an ROC liaison office in the United
States to the family of Chang Hsueh-liang, who is known for his role
in the 1936 Xian Incident and who recently checked into a hospital in
Hawaii for illness and senility.</P>
      <P>Chang expressed his concern for the headline maker in the
tumultuous period in modern Chinese history prior to the 1940s via
the representative office, wishing the 101-year-old "Young Marshal" a
speedy recovery and long life.</P>
      <P>Refuting recent news reports that have said the "Young Marshal"
was in critical condition and that his son had refused to consent to
the use of life-support devices to keep the elder Chang alive, Chang
Hsueh-liang's son publicized an open letter Thursday announcing that
although his father is currently in the intensive care unit of a
Honolulu hospital, his condition is rather stable and he does not
require a respirator.</P>
      <P>Premier Chang, who paid a visit to Chang Hsueh-liang at Chang's
Honolulu residence in early September this year on his way back to
Taiwan after a four-nation official tour to the Eastern Caribbean,
recalled that the marshal was in good health then except for a
hearing weakness.</P>
      <P>The premier recalled that Chang, a devout Christian, was in high
spirits during the visit and even composed a poem right on the spot
as a gift to him.</P>
      <P>Chang Hsueh-liang, son of northeastern mainland Chinese warlord
Chang Tso-lin, played a key role in the kidnapping of Generalissimo
Chiang Kai-shek in 1936 in order to persuade Chiang to go all out
against Japanese aggression, an incident known in contemporary
Chinese history as the "Xian Incident."</P>
      <P>Chang Hsueh-liang, who along with his father possessed prominent
military and business influence in northern China at the time, became
a flash point figure in Chinese politics on Dec. 29, 1928, when he
pledged allegiance to the Nationalist government led by Chiang
Kai-shek.</P>
      <P>But a key incident in Chinese history took place on Dec. 12,
1936, when Generalissimo Chiang flew to Xian to order Chang and army
general Yang Hu-cheng to attack the Chinese communists. However,
Chang instead detained Chiang. It was not until two weeks later, with
the nation clamoring for Chiang's release, that the generalissimo was
freed.</P>
      <P>Chang lived under virtual house arrest for nearly half a century
after moving to Taiwan along with the ROC government in 1949. He
regained his freedom only after President Lee Teng-hui democratized
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chang and his wife moved to Hawaii in 1993 and have since lived
in seclusion. He and his wife, who died several years ago, went to
church, listened to Chinese opera and played mahjong, but always
stayed away from the media.</P>

both inbound and outbound passengers registered growth in the first
half of this year, the Tourism Bureau reported Friday.</P>
      <P>According to the bureau's tallies, the number of inbound
visitors totaled more than 1.38 million between January and June
this year, marking a 10.64 percent increase from the year-earlier
level.</P>
      <P>During the same six-month period, the number of outbound
travelers reached 3.7 million, up 3.67 percent from the figure
recorded for the like period of last year.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Republic of China nationals made 54.38 million visits
in the first half of the year, marking a 2.8 percent annual
growth.</P>
      <P>Tourist officials said the Tourism Bureau has been endeavoring to
promote Taiwan as an "island of tourism" in the international travel
market.</P>
      <P>The bureau has commissioned multinational advertising companies
to draw up comprehensive promotional packages to help attract
foreign tourists, the officials said.</P>
      <P>"We are crafting a new international image for Taiwan in order
to realize our goal of posting a 10 percent gain in the number
of tourist arrivals annually," said a bureau official.</P>
      <P>According to the official, Japan remained the largest source of
foreign tourists to Taiwan. As many Japanese youths like to travel
abroad for short-term study, the official said the Tourism Bureau
is encouraging local senior high schools and vocational schools to
organize various study programs, including Chinese language and
history courses, to lure young Japanese travelers.</P>
      <P>The official said the bureau will also help local schools launch
promotional programs in Japan in cooperation with local and Japanese
travel agencies.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the official said, the bureau is creating an Internet
portal to provide comprehensive Taiwan-related tourist information
and other relevant data to facilitate promotional operations and
attract would-be visitors.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LOCAL UNIVERSITY TO OPEN EMBA CLASSES IN MAINLAND CHINA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  12  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Yuan Ze University in Chungli, northern
Taiwan, has jumped the gun by offering the first EMBA classes to
Taiwan business people operating in mainland China, faculty sources
at the school said Friday.</P>
      <P>Yuan Ze University's management school began to receive
registration reservations Friday for credits to be earned in the EMBA
extension program. By doing so, it became the first Taiwan-based
institute to begin offering extension programs outside the island
since the Ministry of Education acquiesced to local universities'
demands in August to be allowed to offer extension programs in
Southeast Asia and mainland China.</P>
      <P>Since the extension education program will not legitimately take
effect until February, Lee Yung-hui, director of the Yuan Ze
Institute of Management, said the school only began to receive
reservations for the EMBA credit-granting program Friday, adding that
the students to-be do not need to pay their tuition until the classes
are formally opened.</P>
      <P>The Yuan Ze management school is expected to initially open
classes in three subjects in the credit-granting EMBA program, which
will be available for Taiwan businesspeople at three schools in
Guangzhou, Beijing and Shanghai, according to Lee.</P>
      <P>Education Ministry officials said earlier this year that the
extension classes to be opened in mainland China will cater only to
Taiwan businesspeople until such time as the government grants
credentials to mainland Chinese schools.</P>
      <P>They said the Taiwan-initiated extension programs will be opened
to mainland Chinese students only after the government has certified
the academic excellence of mainland Chinese schools.</P>
      <P>Although Education Minister Ovid Tzeng has said he hopes the
policy of acknowledging academic credits granted by mainland Chinese
schools will be confirmed by the end of the year, many local
universities have jumped the gun by contracting mainland Chinese
school authorities in the hopes of opening extension classes for
Taiwan businesspeople there.</P>
      <P>Under the ministry's plan, credits earned in the extension
programs will be applicable toward a bachelor's or master's degree.</P>

    <HEADLINE>COMMUNICATIONS MINISTRY CONSIDERS LOW PRICE TAG FOR 3G LICENSES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  12  (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The vice minister of communications said
Thursday that the Ministry of Transportation and Communications will
issue five licenses to operate third-generation (3G) mobile phone
services through auction, with a low price tag to encourage more
bidding.</P>
      <P>Tsai Duei noted that the ministry approved that day the
regulatory provisions for 3G -- also known as UTMS (universal mobile
telecommunications system) -- services.</P>
      <P>At least seven telecommunications and wireless telecommunications
service companies have shown interest in bidding -- Chunghwa Telecom,
Teco Electric and Machinery, ET Group, First International Telecom
Group, Far Eastone, Taiwan Cellular Corp. and KG Telecommunications.</P>
      <P>Tsai said that the government will announce the price of the bids
"soon."</P>
      <P>He pointed out that some European telecommunications authorities
have grossed billions of dollars from 3G mobile phone proceeds.
However, as the economic climate is chilly, auctions in other
countries have been disappointing.</P>
      <P>UTMS offers broadband services, which allow high-speed data
transmission and provide Internet and video links. Market experts
have said that commercial 3G services might not be available until
2003 at the earliest and some European telecommunication firms are
facing huge problems over the introduction of 3G technology.</P>
      <P>The information technology consultant Gartner says in a recent
report that building on the 3G networks will be expensive and a slow
supply of terminals will delay the commercial services.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FORMER PRESIDENT URGES TSU SUPPORT TO STABILIZE POLITICAL SITUATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  12  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former President Lee Teng-hui urged the
public Friday to support Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) candidates in
the year-end legislative elections to help stabilize the political
situation.</P>
      <P>Lee, the spiritual leader of the recently formed political group,
made the appeal as he stumped for TSU legislative candidates Tsai
Chung-chi, Chen Chien-ming and Chiu Kuo-chang in Taipei City.</P>
      <P>Lee said that the instability of Taiwan's political scene is the
fault of a chaotic legislature. Referring to KMT Chairman Lien Chan
but refraining from mentioning him by name, he said that "someone"
even tried to recall President Chen Shui-bian because he could not
accept defeat in the presidential election.</P>
      <P>Lee said that the president wants to push through many reforms,
but the legislature will not lend its support, a stance which he said
runs counter to the spirit of democracy.</P>
      <P>Saying he has high expectation of the Taiwan people, Lee said
that the public should help and support Chen during his four-year
presidency.</P>
      <P>He stressed that the year-end elections will be crucial to the
stability of Taiwan in the coming century and urged people to vote
for the candidates of a party that can help solidify the nation and
work with the government.</P>
      <P>The former president urged the public to help Chen realize the
goals of stabilizing the political situation, solidifying democracy,
stimulating the economy and strengthening Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lee said that although he is a octogenarian, he wanted to come
forward to help stabilize the political situation because "the boat
of Taiwan shall not sink."</P>
      <P>On the rush of local businessmen deserting Taiwan in favor of
mainland China, Lee said that economic prosperity in the mainland is
limited to certain parts, which he claimed have been built up through
the thousands of billions of dollars pouring in from Taiwan, a
situation he likened to an unstable house that could collapse at any
time. He further claimed that "80 percent of the Taiwan businessmen
in the mainland lost money."</P>
      <P>According to Lee, the per capita income in Taiwan is US$12,000,
compared with US$800 in the mainland. Amid the economic sluggishness,
he urged the public to work hard and vote in Dec. 1 election.</P>

      <P>The legislative caucuses of the ruling and
opposition parties decided Friday to form a task force to monitor the
effect on Taiwan of the changing international situation in the wake
of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on New York and Washington.</P>
      <P>National Security Council officials and various Cabinet ministers
will be invited to present reports to the task force on a regular

      <P>Last Tuesday, President Chen Shui-bian invited the leaders of the

      <P>Local share prices rebounded considerably
in the past week, stimulated by the upward trend of international
stock markets, especially in the electronics sector, market analysts
said Friday.</P>
      <P>A report released by the Barits Securities Investment Trust Co.
indicates that the weighted price index -- the market's key barometer
-- dropped by 66 percent, from 10,202 points Feb. 27, 2000 to 3,446
points Oct. 3 this year.</P>
      <P>Not only have the traditional manufacturing industries -- such as
cement, construction, textiles, paper, rubber and plastics, food and
nutrition -- suffered tremendous losses, the electronics sector was
also hard hit in terms of stock prices, according to the report.</P>
      <P>It adds that in the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in New
York and Washington, Taiwan's stock prices slid further, with the
electronics and construction sectors suffering the most.</P>
      <P>As the anticipation of war kept international stock markets in
suspense, the Oct. 8 launching of military action against the Taliban
regime in Afghanistan by the United States provided a release for
markets around the world.</P>
      <P>The weighted price index of the Taiwan Stock Exchange rebounded
by nearly 10 percent between Oct. 3 and Oct. 11, with the monetary,
automobile, electronics and steel sectors enjoying the best
performances, according to the report.</P>
      <P>The report points out that prices of electronic shares moved up
an average 13 percent in the past week, partially reflecting the
market atmosphere and also revealing the "irrational" downfall in the

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT MAKES AERIAL INSPECTION OF HIGH-SPEED RAILWAY PROJECT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taichung,  Taiwan, Oct. 12 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian made an
aerial inspection of the ongoing high-speed railway construction
project Friday, starting from Taipei and ending at the Chingchuankang
air base in the central Taiwan county of Taichung.</P>
      <P>Chen told a news conference held at the air base that as the
issue regarding the impact of the high-speed railway's vibration on
the Tainan Science-based Industrial Park has been resolved, Taiwan
Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp. (TSMC) Chairman Morris Chang had
informed him that the company has decided to resume construction of
its new production facilities in the park. TSMC is the world's
largest microchip foundry service.</P>
      <P>The president went on to say that he hopes the bullet
train project can be completed by October 2005 as scheduled to
provide fast, high-quality inter-city travel services along Taiwan's
western corridor.</P>
      <P>The high-speed railway, with a length of 345 km and trains
running at a maximum speed of 300 km per hour, is expected to
drastically shorten the terrestrial travel time between Taipei in the
north and Kaohsiung in the south.</P>
      <P>Noting that once the new railway is open to traffic, a trip from
Taipei to Kaohsiung with a single stop at Taichung will take only
about 90 minutes, Chen said the completion of the project will
represent a transport revolution for the country.</P>
      <P>At the moment, Chen said, he is not only concerned about the
completion date of the new rail system but also about relevant
planning work.</P>
      <P>Chen said he has two expectations concerning the development of
the high-speed railway project -- that the government should hammer
out a comprehensive development plan integrating railway, highway,
air and maritime transport services and that the central and local
governments should join forces to craft new regional development
projects in the vicinity of the 14 cities and counties and the 10
stations through which the railway will pass.</P>
      <P>As construction of the new railway will certainly affect the
everyday lives of those residing in areas near the construction
sites, Chen said relevant government agencies and the Taiwan
High-Speed Rail Corp. (THSRC) should streamline management and
supervision of contractors and strengthen communications with local
residents to seek their support and understanding.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, THSRC Chairwoman Nita Ing said construction on the
high-speed railway, with a price tag of NT$407.6 billion (US$11.82
billion), has been proceeding smoothly and will gradually shift into
high gear early next year.</P>

      <P>A Tainan-based bird conservation society
said Friday that they are conducting a general survey of black-faced
spoonbills and urged the public not to destroy the natural Taiwan
habitat of the endangered species.</P>
      <P>Thousands of migratory birds representing more than 30 species
arrive in Taiwan each autumn, especially at the mouth of the Tsengwen
Creek in Tainan County, southern Taiwan, to spend the winter,
according to the Tainan County Black-faced Spoonbill Preservation
Society.</P>
      <P>The black-faced spoonbill, one of the world's rarest birds with
only an estimated 600-700 remaining, attract the most attention.
Generally about half of the world population of the birds migrate to
Taiwan every winter, according to a society member.</P>
      <P>The member noted that 33 black-faced spoonbills have arrived so
far this year, attracting many bird watchers to the mouth of the
Tsengwen Creek. He predicted that more of the birds will arrive,
especially after November, and added that Tainan's environmental

they worry much about being bald, according to a survey conducted
recently by a pharmaceutical company.</P>
      <P>The sales of baldness remedies would be much greater in Taiwan if
more people were to seek medical help for baldness, according to the
survey results.</P>
      <P>The survey found that only about 16 percent of men in Taiwan
whose hairline began to recede at the age of 20 seek medical help,
while most of them just accept their hair loss as a fact of life.</P>
      <P>The random survey of 600 males aged between 18 and 49 in Taiwan's
three major cities found that only 14 percent of them consider
themselves bald. Of them, only 33 percent took concrete action,
including using medicated shampoo, scalp care, seeking folk
prescriptions to taking Western medicine, in that order.</P>
      <P>Most respondents have not taken any action with regard to their
baldness because they feel the issue is unimportant, because
treatment is too troublesome or because they do not know where to
find treatment, in that order, the survey found.</P>
      <P>According to U.S.-based MSD, the pharmaceutical company which
produces the renowned anti baldness treatment Propecia, the company
has sold nine million pills since the medicine was allowed to be
marketed in Taiwan 22 months ago, or an average of 13,000 per day.
The active ingredient in the product is finasteride 1 mg.</P>
      <P>According to Wu Min-chi, a dermatologist at Cathay General
Hospital, while Propecia is so far one of the most effective
treatments for androgenic alopecia -- male pattern baldness -- it is
not recommended as treatment for all kinds of baldness.</P>
      <P>Another MSD-developed medicine -- Poscar, which contains 5 mg
finasteride and was originally developed for treatment of enlarged
prostate, has also been used by Taiwan consumers as a baldness
remedy. The medicine, however, is not recommended by dermatologists
because of its high dose of finasteride.</P>
      <P>Improper or excessive use of both Propecia and Poscar can cause
side effects such as sexual dysfunction, Wu noted.</P>
      <P>Women who suffer baldness, especially pregnant women, are
generally not recommended to use Propecia as it can harm the male
fetus, he added.</P>

      <P>The Directorate General of Customs under
the Ministry of Finance announced Friday that "kaoliang" liquor from
the island of Kinmen was exported to mainland China through the "mini
three links" mechanism for the first time in September.</P>
      <P>According to the ministry's statistics, a total of 3,032
kilograms of the sorghum liquor valued at NT$392,050 (US$11,350) were
shipped to mainland China directly from the island, which lies much
closer to the mainland than it does to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In the past, such exports have always been routed via a third
area like Hong Kong or Macau.</P>
      <P>This marked the first time that Kinmen Kaoliang Liquor Inc. has
taken advantage of Taiwan's new policy established in January to
allow direct shipping, trade, and postal links between the islands of
Kinmen and Matsu and their corresponding designated ports on the
mainland.</P>
      <P>According to government statistics, the Kinmen branch of the
Kaohsiung Customs Bureau has recorded a total of 26 cases of imports
to Kinmen from January to September, and four cases of exports from

    <TEXT>
      <P>Farmers in southern Taiwan have reported
that Formosan macaques, a protected primate species, are becoming so
outrageous that they are now milking goats, a local evening newspaper
reported Friday.</P>
      <P>The United Evening News quoted Tsai Fu-ching, chief of Tsaishan
Li (an administrative unit) in Kaohsiung City, who confirmed the
reports.</P>
      <P>Tsaishan residents said that they have often seen the monkeys
milking goats in the past, adding that they tended to appear in the
morning and would hang around with the goats in order to steal their
food. Not satisfied with this petty larceny, they then grab the
goats' teats and milk them.</P>
      <P>Tsai said that the sheep do not resist and do not seem alarmed by
the monkeys, possibly because they are so used to their presence.</P>
      <P>The farmers claimed that the monkeys have become more and more
bold recently, with one owner claiming that his daily take of around
20 liters of milk has dropped to no more than 10 liters in recent
months.</P>
      <P>One local expert said the monkeys might be stealing milk because
Kaohsiung city authorities have prohibited people from feeding them
and they are starving as a result.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Many people in Taiwan do not agree with the
remarks of former Republic of China President Lee Teng-hui that the
opposition Kuomintang is a "foreign power," according to results of a
opinion poll released Friday.</P>
      <P>The poll, commissioned by KMT Legislator Wu Ko-ching, who is also
chairman of a public affairs and policy study association, was
conducted between Oct. 5-10 based on telephone interviews. The
survey, which received 1,071 valid respondents, had a margin of error
of plus or minus 3 percent.</P>
      <P>Lee, who is also former chairman of the KMT, has recently made
numerous remarks hinting that the KMT is a "foreign power" and its
leaders are fighting with Communist China against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The results of the poll found that 65 percent of respondents did
not agree with Lee's intimation that the KMT is a "foreign power,"
while 62 percent did not think that the KMT is "cooperating" with
mainland China against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The survey also found that 56 percent did not think that the
KMT's plan to remove President Chen Shui-bian of the Democratic
Progressive Party from office last year was because it could not face
the reality of its failure in the 2000 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Sixty-eight percent think that Lee backs Taiwan independence,
according to the poll.</P>
      <P>As to how the KMT should respond to the verbal attacks from Lee,
opinions were varied, with 31 percent maintaining that the KMT should
react strongly; 26 percent said the KMT should keep a low-profile;
and 25 percent said the KMT should just ignore the issue.</P>
      <P>From the divided opinions, it seems that the KMT will find it
hard to react properly to Lee's attacks, according to the survey.</P>
      <P>Referring to approval ratings, the survey said that the KMT's

    <TEXT>
      <P>A newly founded political group, Shanmeng,
said Friday it would not hesitate to support candidates for the Dec.
1 elections who share similar political ideals and concepts as its
members.</P>
      <P>Convener Hsu Hsin-liang of Shanmeng, or Mountain Alliance, made
the remarks at a news conference where he also introduced four
Shanmeng members who have registered their candidacy for the upcoming
elections for legislators and local government chiefs.</P>
      <P>Hsu, a former chairman of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) who quit the party to run in the 2000 presidential election,
said he hopes to see more like-minded people enter the upcoming
races.</P>
      <P>Hsu outlined Shanmeng candidates' common campaign platform which
includes promoting globalization, defending the political system
prescribing in the Republic of China Constitution, fighting against
the influence of moneyed interests in domestic politics and ending
"national capitalism" by privatizing government-run companies.</P>
      <P>Hsu said the constitutional system, national capitalism and
globalization are the three core issues to be debated in the pivotal
December legislative elections. "They are also the three key issues
Taiwan must address after the elections," he added.</P>
      <P>Hsu further said Shanmeng hopes that more like-minded people can
enter the new Legislative Yuan to help promote its causes. "Our often
unruly legislative body needs the participation of social elite to
nurture a new political culture and instill better legislative
ethics," he said.</P>
      <P>The four Shanmeng members to run in the upcoming elections are
Chu Li-lun, an incumbent opposition Kuomintang legislator who has
been nominated by his party to run for Taoyuan County magistrate;
Shih Ming-teh, a sitting lawmaker and former DPP chairman who has

    <HEADLINE>'MINI THREE LINKS' GRADUALLY HEATING UP: MAC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  12  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Ten months after implementation, the
direct "mini three links" across the Taiwan Strait have gradually
heated up with cooperation of mainland China, a senior official said
Friday.</P>
      <P>Lin Chong-pin, vice chairman of the Cabinet-level Mainland
Affairs Council (MAC), which charts Taiwan's policy toward mainland
China, made the remarks at a routine news conference.</P>
      <P>In an effort to signify its sincerity to promote cross-strait
rapprochement, the Republic of China government opened its two
frontline islands of Kinmen and Matsu for direct trade, mail and
shipping links with mainland China's Xiamen and Mawei, commonly
known as "mini three links," at the beginning of this year.</P>
      <P>At first, mainland China cold-shouldered the program and
imposed strict restrictions on mainland Chinese people and
ships intending to make direct voyages to the ROC's two
defense outposts.</P>
      <P>In recent months, Lin said, mainland China has gradually eased
such restrictions. "We recognize mainland China's goodwill in
allowing more mainland people and boats to sail directly to Kinmen
and Matsu," Lin said.</P>
      <P>At present, mainland China still would not allow regular direct
Kinmen-Xiamen and Matsu-Mawei shipping services and instead approves
such applications on a case-by-case basis.</P>
      <P>Lin said he hopes mainland China can adopt a more realistic and
pragmatic manner in handling civilian, social and economic exchanges
between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait for mutual benefits.</P>
      <P>According to MAC tallies, ROC ships had made 96 direct voyages
from Kinmen and Matsu to Xiamen and Mawei in the southeastern
mainland province of Fujian as of the end of September, while
mainland vessels made 27 direct Xiamen-Kinmen and Mawei-Matsu
voyages during the same nine-month period.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 8,703 ROC nationals had sailed directly to Xiamen and
Mawei between January and September, and 524 mainland Chinese
residents had made direct voyages to the ROC's two outlying islands
during the same period. Both Kinmen and Matsu lie closer to the
mainland than to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lin also called on mainland China to resume regular cross-strait
dialogue as early as possible so as to let the "mini three links"
proceed even more smoothly and facilitate normalization of bilateral
relations.</P>

      <P>The Executive Yuan has further simplified
the procedures for economic, trade and technology professionals from
mainland China to apply to enter Taiwan, a government spokesman said
Friday.</P>
      <P>Government Information Office Director General Su Tzen-ping said
that mainland Chinese economic and trade professional working for
multinational companies as well as technology professionals will now
need to file their entry applications only five days in advance
instead of two months.</P>
      <P>He said that the Cabinet made the decision in response to the
suggestions of the American Chamber of Commerce in Taipei (AmCham)
and the European Council of Commerce and Trade (ECCT).</P>
      <P>Su went on to say that the Cabinet has also decided to follow
their suggestion to allow the local organizations that invite the
mainland professionals to pass on the official travel documents
instead of delivering the papers in a roundabout manner via
government-appointed agencies or organizations in Hong Kong or Macau.</P>
      <P>Following the conclusions of the presidential Economic
Development Advisory Conference held in August, the government has
further extended the maximum duration of stay for mainland technology
professionals who visit Taiwan to participate in technology research
from three years to six years, he added.</P>
      <P>Su said that in accordance with other conclusions at the
conference and the suggestions of AmCham and the ECCT, the Cabinet
has also simplified the document flow process to waive guarantee
verifications for guarantors who work in multinational corporations
or foreign-invested companies approved by the Ministry of Economic
Affairs as long as the companies stamp their seals on the documents.</P>
      <P>He added that the Cabinet has allowed mainland professionals to

    <HEADLINE>GROWTH OF TAIWAN AIDS PATIENTS EXPECTED TO FALL IN 2 YEARS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  12  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The number of AIDS patients in Taiwan is
expected to decrease in two years, as more people become aware of how
to protect themselves from the deadly disease, the head of a sexual
disease prevention center said Friday.</P>
      <P>Wu Shui-ying, head of the Taipei Municipal Sexual Disease
Prevention Center, said control of the disease in Taiwan is in a
similar situation to that in Japan and South Korea but added that a
fall in the number of newly infected patients should occur in one or
two years.</P>
      <P>Wu, who took part in a recent Asia-Pacific conference on AIDS
prevention in Melbourne, Australia, said only active prevention
measures, such as education and practicing safe sex, can reduce the
risks of infection and stem the outflow of financial resources that
the government has to shoulder for AIDS patients.</P>
      <P>In the first half of this year, there were 282 newly infected HIV
patients in Taiwan, according to Wu. The number stood at 531 in 2000,
476 in 1999, 403 in 1998 and 353 in 1997. She said that it appeared
that the number had peaked last year and said that it is expected to
fall gradually in the coming years.</P>
      <P>Judging from the infection rate among the young men preparing to
start their military service, six to seven people out of every
100,000 test HIV positive, Wu said. Illegal prostitutes who have been
required to undergo an HIV test have resulted in figures that
indicate that one or two out of every 1,000 test positive.</P>
      <P>Wu, noted, however, that the government is carrying a great
financial burden for providing free treatment of the cocktail therapy
in its national health program to people inflicted by HIV.</P>
      <P>Citing estimates by the Cabinet-level Department of Health, Wu
said that government spending on each AIDS patient can amount to
NT$350,000 per year. Currently, there are more than 1,000 AIDS
patients receiving the cocktail therapy provided by the government,
she said.</P>
      <P>Wu said that the actual number of HIV patients in Taiwan is
around 15,000, much higher than the government estimate of 3,000, a
situation which means that many of them are unaware that they are
AIDS-virus carriers. She also warned that about 10 percent of the
AIDS patients refuse treatment and go into hiding.</P>
      <P>While calling for all-out efforts by the government to prevent
the disease and trace missing patients, Wu said that education for
Taiwan's populace on this front is a pressing issue.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Federation of Overseas Chinese
Associations Friday issued a statement to oppose a proposal to merge
the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission (OCAC) with the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs (MOFA).</P>
      <P>The statement, issued at a meeting of the federation's standing
board of directors, criticized the Democratic Progressive Party
administration for attempting to have the OCAC become a subordinate
organ of MOFA.</P>
      <P>It said the move would "cut off the long and deep connections
between overseas Chinese residents and the Republic of China," and
added that it will "hurt the interests of overseas Chinese residents
protected by the Constitution."</P>
      <P>The statement said that the federation will lead the way to
oppose the government plan along with leaders of the overseas Chinese
communities and overseas Chinese organizations.</P>
      <P>Kwan Yuk-noan, a Kuomintang legislator elected from the United
States, said that he is absolutely against the plan to merge the OCAC
with MOFA.</P>
      <P>He said that those who advocate the merger plan do not understand
the real situation of the overseas Chinese communities. "At a time
when mainland China is doing its utmost to woo overseas Chinese
residents, how can we have the OCAC merged?" Kwan went on.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said recently that the government will
form a "committee for government reorganization" in the near future
to streamline governmental agencies.</P>
      <P>In response to the overseas Chinese federation's statement, an
official with the Research, Development and Evaluation Commission
(RDEC) said Friday that it is still too early to talk about the OCAC
merger plan because the direction of the reorganization plan has not
been fixed yet.</P>
      <P>He said that the "committee for government organization" will be
operated by the Presidential Office, and added that the RDEC is only
responsible for implementing the government's decisions.</P>
      <P>In connection with the issue, OCAC Secretary-General Hsu
Chen-jung said that no final decision has been made regarding whether
to merge the OCAC with the foreign ministry.</P>
      <P>He asserted that "if a decision has been made by the government,
the public servants would have no other choice, but to accept the
decision."</P>

Federation of Overseas Chinese Associations, a social organization,
has the right to express its opinions and ideas."</P>

    <HEADLINE>NEW  BOOK  RELEASED:  'STOP  STIRRING  UP TROUBLE, MR. LEE TENG-HUI'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Oct.  12  (CNA)
(By David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A new book written by two senior
journalists which attempts to clarify events concerning former
Republic of China President Lee Teng-hui and 12 of his colleagues
during his tenure as head of state was published Friday.</P>
      <P>Written by Lu Keng and Ma Hsi-ping, the book titled, "Stop
Stirring Up Trouble, Mr. Lee Teng-hui" was introduced to the public
at a news conference attended by Lu, Ma, Wang Tso-jung, former head
of the Control Yuan, government's highest watchdog organization,
senior journalist Chang Fo-chien and other dignitaries.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the news conference, Lu and Ma stressed that it was
their belief that reporters should file balanced reports that
compelled them to write the book to check the veracity of claims made
in other books published recently.</P>
      <P>In the other books on Lee, Lee slammed almost every one of his
colleagues and wrote off their contributions during his 12-year
tenure as head of state, including Lien Chan, current chairman of the
opposition Kuomintang (KMT). The KMT lost the presidency to the
Democratic Progressive Party in the presidential election held in
March, 2000.</P>
      <P>Lu and Ma said that they interviewed 12 of Lee's past colleagues
to give their accounts of the events attributed to Lee in past books.</P>
      <P>The two senior journalists said the 12 told them the truth about
what they had learned about events surrounding Lee.</P>
      <P>The KMT revoked Lee's party membership Sept. 21 for his verbal
attacks on the party and his stumping for rival Taiwan Solidarity
Union's (TSU) candidates for the year-end legislative and local
elections.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TYPHOON `HAIYAN' POSING INCREASING THREAT TO TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 13 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A tropical storm originating in the Pacific
which was upgraded to a typhoon early Saturday morning is expected to
begin affecting Taiwan's weather Monday, Central Weather Bureau (CWB)
sources reported.</P>
      <P>Meteorologists at the weather bureau warned that Typhoon Haiyan
(Ocean Swallow), an "autumn typhoon," could be disastrous as its
outer rim will be accompanied by the northeast monsoon, with the
combination being capable of triggering torrential rains.</P>
      <P>The impact of autumn typhoons on the island doubles when they are
"fueled" by northeast monsoons, which significantly affect Taiwan's
weather during the fall and winter, the meteorologists said.</P>
      <P>Typhoon Haiyan is expected to bring heavy rains to mountainous
areas in the north and eastern parts of Taiwan as well as strong
winds to coastal areas in eastern Taiwan in the following days.</P>
      <P>Haiyan was located some 1,000 kilometers southeast of Taiwan as
of Saturday noon and was moving in a northeasterly direction at a
snail's pace, the CWB meteorologists said, adding that although it
was moving slowly, it was gradually gaining strength.</P>
      <P>Exactly when and if the weather bureau will issue sea and land
warnings for Typhoon Haiyan will depend on further observations of
the typhoon's speed and course, they added.</P>
      <P>Weather across island on Saturday has generally been good, with
temperatures of between 21 and 28 degrees Celsius in northern Taiwan,
21-29 degrees Celsius in central Taiwan, and 23-30 degrees Celsius in
southern Taiwan, according to the weather bureau.</P>
      <P>Two "autumn typhoons" battered Taiwan this August and September,
respectively, with unprecedently high amount of precipitation,
causing heavy human casualties as well as extensive property damage
and losses in northern, eastern and central Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN TO FORMALLY BECOME WTO MEMBER FEB. 1: OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  13  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Barring unexpected developments, the
Republic of China will formally become a member of the World Trade
Organization (WTO) Feb. 1, 2002, a senior official said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Wu Wen-ya, director of the Board of Foreign Trade (MOFT), made
the remarks before leaving for Shanghai to attend an informal meeting
of senior officials of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)
forum.</P>
      <P>Despite the current U.S.-led war on terrorism, Wu said, the WTO
has not given any hints that it might change the schedule of its
ministerial meeting slated for Nov. 9-13 in Qatar.</P>
      <P>Wu said the Geneva-based trade regulatory body is expected to
formally approve Taiwan's and mainland China's WTO membership bids at
its November ministerial meeting as relevant WTO working parties
already endorsed their accession terms in September.</P>
      <P>"Once the WTO ministerial meeting passes Taiwan's WTO membership
application, our Legislative Yuan must approve all the promises we
have made, including the passage of 19 related legislative bills," Wu
said.</P>
      <P>As the legislature will suspend operations in November to allow
incumbent legislators to focus energy on preparations for the Dec. 1
elections, Wu said, screening of the WTO-related bills is not
expected to be finalized until the end of this year.</P>
      <P>According to the WTO regulations, Taiwan must then present all of
the parliament-endorsed bills and other relevant documents to the WTO
Secretariat before becoming a formal member 30 days after the
presentation of all of these protocols.</P>
      <P>"So if all goes well, we'll be able to enter the WTO as a full
member Feb. 1 next year," Wu said.</P>
      <P>He went on to say that as Taiwan has promised to cut import
tariffs and further open its markets following its WTO entry, the
domestic agricultural sector will sustain greater adverse impacts
than the domestic industrial sector will.</P>
      <P>Wu said sales of certain locally produced fruits, such as wax
apples and mangoes, will be affected by the influx of foreign fruits.
As for the industrial and service sectors, Wu said, the impact is
expected to be relatively smaller.</P>
      <P>Touching on the APEC informal senior officials meeting, Wu said
it is basically a forum for member states to exchange views and forge
friendships as its decisions are not binding.</P>
      <P>Wu said the agenda will focus on promoting free trade and
Asia-Pacific regional prosperity as well as on boosting e-commerce.</P>
      <P>The APEC senior officials meeting will be followed by an annual
ministerial meeting next week. Minister of Economic Affairs Lin
Hsin-yi and Chairman Chen Po-chih of the Council for Economic
Planning and Development will represent Taiwan at the conference.</P>
      <P>Wu said the APEC ministerial meeting may add a new topic --
cooperation in the fight against global terrorism -- to its agenda
this year.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, an APEC informal leadership meeting is scheduled to
take place in Shanghai Dec. 20-21. ROC President Chen Shui-bian has
appointed former Vice President Li Yuan-zu to attend the summit
meeting on his behalf. But mainland China has yet to make any
response concerning Li's presence at the meeting.</P>
      <P>APEC groups 21 members -- Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Hong
Kong, Indonesia, Japan, mainland China, Malaysia, Mexico, New
Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Peru, the Philippines, Russia, Singapore,
South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, the United States and Vietnam.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GOVERNMENT PROPOSES NEW RETIREMENT PENSION PLANS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 13 (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Council of Labor Affairs
(CLA) on Friday completed a preliminary draft statute governing a
proposed set of new retirement pension plans including individual
retirement accounts (IRAs) and annuity accounts.</P>
      <P>The CLA finished the initial designs after a series of
discussions with officials of the Cabinet-level Council for Economic
Planning and Development and members of the employment panel of the
presidential Economic Development Advisory Conference held in August.</P>
      <P>The CLA is scheduled to ratify the draft within two weeks and
submit it to the Cabinet for further discussions before the end of
October.</P>
      <P>According to the draft, three different pension plans will be
available, and employees will have the option of switching between
the different plans as many times as they wish within the first five
years of the new pension system's adoption.</P>
      <P>However, newcomers to the job market after the five year grace
period will have to stick by their choices until retirement.</P>
      <P>Except for companies with over 500 employees -- which are allowed
to design their own corporate retirement plans, subject to CLA
approval as well as to the consent of their labor unions or
two-thirds of the employees -- all employers are required to give
their employees the freedom to choose between the IRA and the annuity
plans.</P>
      <P>Under the proposed IRA plan, employers must contribute funds to
an employee's IRA each month equal to 6 percent of that employee's
insured monthly salary. That employee will be allowed to deposit an
additional maximum 6 percent to the IRA without having to pay income
tax on the deposited money until it is withdrawn.</P>
      <P>When the employee retires at the age of 60, or if the employee
becomes disabled, dies or loses his or her Republic of China
citizenship permanently, a lump sum pension including interest earned
will be handed out.</P>
      <P>Employees will be allowed to choose their own accredited asset
management companies to administer their IRAs.</P>
      <P>During the transition to the IRA plan, employers will be required
to deposit 2 percent to their employees' IRAs in the first year, 4
percent in the second year and a full 6 percent in the third year.</P>
      <P>Under the proposed annuity option, employers must also contribute
6 percent of an employee's insured monthly salary to a retirement
fund each month. That employee will be able to receive a retirement
pension in monthly installments equivalent to an estimated 21 percent
of his or her average insured salary in the last three years of
employment.</P>
      <P>The fund will be administered by one or two financial
organizations appointed by a supervisory board made up of labor
representatives, experts and government officials.</P>
      <P>Investment strategies for that fund will be decided by the same
supervisory board, but the employees will have to contribute
additional money to a maximum of 6 percent of their insured monthly
salaries to cover for inadequate funds as a result of any investment
losses.</P>
      <P>In the event that an employee dies, his or her family is
guaranteed to receive the annuity for a total of 10 years.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The rampancy of counterfeit bank notes in
circulation in Taiwan has prompted the Central Bank of China (CBC) to
strengthen efforts at educating the public on how to distinguish fake
bills from real ones.</P>
      <P>The CBC has added two items on its Web site's home page to teach
the public the different ways to distinguish forged bank notes from
real ones and to explain the law regarding printing and using
counterfeit bills.</P>
      <P>The CBC's Web site (www.cbc.gov.tw) has provided five basic
methods to help the general public distinguish whether a bank note is
fake or genuine.</P>
      <P>Counterfeit bank notes of NT$100, NT$500 and NT$1,000
denomination, especially those of NT$1,000 denomination, have
frequently been found in circulation recently. Even counterfeit coins
of NT$50 denomination have been found in circulation.</P>
      <P>According to Republic of China law, a person who is found guilty
of counterfeiting or altering currently used Taiwan currency shall
receive a minimum sentence of five-year imprisonment or a maximum
sentence of death.</P>
      <P>ROC law also stipulates that a person found guilty of putting
counterfeit Taiwan currency into circulation or of collecting it from
or delivering it to others with the intent of putting it into
circulation shall receive a sentence of between three and ten years
in prison.</P>
      <P>A person who unknowingly receives counterfeit currency and then
knowingly uses it or delivers to others with the intent of putting
into circulation shall receive at most a fine of NT$15,000 if found
guilty, according to ROC law.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NO DIRECT CROSS-STRAIT FLIGHTS WITHOUT GOVERNMENT AUTHORIZATION: CAA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  13  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>No Taiwan air carrier will be allowed to
operate direct flights to mainland China without the authorization of
the government, an official from the Civil Aeronautics Administration
(CAA) under the Ministry of Transportation and Communications said
Saturday.</P>
      <P>Direct flights across the Taiwan Strait will only be possible
after the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) makes it a
national policy before conducting negotiations with mainland Chinese
authorities on the plan and forging a formal agreement, CAA Deputy
Director-General Chang Kuo-cheng said.</P>
      <P>Chang urged authorities in Beijing to engage in "official
bilateral negotiations" with Taiwan on direct cross-strait flights,
saying the sooner this is done, the better.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks in response to a report that the Taiwan and
mainland Chinese aviation industries agreed Friday to offer flights
with airlines from both sides not displaying national flags.</P>
      <P>Representatives of the Taiwan and mainland Chinese aviation
industries agreed at a seminar held in Beijing Friday that if direct
bilateral flights become possible in the future, then all aircraft
plying cross-strait routes will fly without their respective national
flags.</P>
      <P>Republic of China Legislator Elmer Fung from the opposition New
Party, who headed a Taiwan delegation to Beijing, along with Bao
Peide, deputy director of mainland China's Civil Aviation
Administration, made the announcement together after the seminar.</P>
      <P>They announced that the two sides came to an agreement on the
fact that both Taiwan and mainland China have already suffered
immense losses in terms of time and money due to the fact direct
flight services between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait are still
illegal.</P>
      <P>They said that the survival and development of the Taiwan and
mainland Chinese aviation industries depend on the opening of direct
cross-strait airlinks.</P>
      <P>The two sides also agreed that they hope to rely on private
sector aviation organizations to carry on with regularly or
irregularly scheduled evaluations of related technical or operational
issues while expanding the topics of discussion.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the report, Chang said that because of the
uniqueness of the cross-Taiwan Strait relationship, which has
prevented Taiwan from applying international practices to solve
cross-strait disputes, Taiwan airlines are not allowed to initiate
direct flights to or from mainland China without governmental
approval, even though the current statutes governing private
exchanges across the strait have not specifically restricted Taiwan
carriers from doing so.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GOVERNMENT LOOKS INTO KMT ASSETS IN RESPONSE TO CONTROL YUAN DEMANDS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 13 (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Cabinet Secretary-General Chiou I-jen said
Saturday that the government's move to assess whether the opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) has obtained public assets illegally in the past was
taken in response to the Control Yuan's demands.</P>
      <P>Chiou said that despite "natural" reactions questioning the move
as politically motivated -- particularly with legislative elections
coming up in December -- the Executive Yuan cannot evade the issue
brought up by the government's highest supervisory body, which has
recently completed an investigation into the KMT's allegedly illegal
assets and urged the Executive Yuan to conduct its own thorough
investigation on the matter.</P>
      <P>Chiou went on to say that if the Executive Yuan did not act on
the Control Yuan's demands, it would be criticized as
administratively indolent or disrespectful toward the Control Yuan.</P>
      <P>Therefore, he said that the administration will handle the case
according to "normal procedures" and will not purposely speed up the
process.</P>
      <P>Chiou said that because a lot of ministries and government
agencies are involved in the lengthy investigation process, the first
phase is being handled by Minister-without-Portfolio Hsu Chih-hsiung,
who is assembling a special task force to compile available
information on the case.</P>
      <P>Afterward, the government will look into ways of handling related
legal issues, he added.</P>
      <P>Chiou said even if the KMT assets are found to have been acquired
following legal procedures, the Executive Yuan will continue to look
into whether the process was "justified." If the acquisition was not
justified, then the administration will study whether to resolve the
issue by drafting a special bill to reclaim the assets or through
other means, he added.</P>
      <P>In response to the government's investigation, a KMT spokesman
charged that the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) administration is
only trying to shift the public focus away from the DPP's
"ineffective governance."</P>
      <P>KMT Cultural and Communications Committee spokesman Chou
Shou-shun said that the KMT has already been doing its own asset
assessments for the past year in order to put them into trusts and
make the party's assets transparent to the public.</P>
      <P>In the event that the investigation discovers any illegally
obtained public assets, Chou said that the KMT will act in accordance
with the law and will not be greedy about such "illegally acquired
wealth."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, opposition People First Party Chairman James Soong,
who once served as KMT secretary-general, said that he supports the
move to assess the KMT assets from a legal point of view if it is
handled in a just and farsighted manner.</P>
      <P>However, he said that because the KMT and the government relied
on each other in the early years of the party's rule on Taiwan to
provide political stability and economic prosperity to the island, it
cannot be said that the KMT took complete advantage of the government
because the party's assets have also done a lot for the country.</P>
      <P>Soong added that because of the ongoing election campaign season,
he hopes that all sides can handle the issue with a fair-minded
attitude and without becoming emotional.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BUSINESSPEOPLE INVESTING IN INTERNET CAFE PLAZA IN KAOHSIUNG</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  13  (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>While the customers at the some 4,000
Internet cafes around the island are mostly teenagers, businesspeople
in Kaohsiung in southern Taiwan are planning to develop an Internet
cafe plaza aimed at the whole family.</P>
      <P>The Internet cafe plaza under planning will have gardens,
multimedia centers and restaurants. The investors plan to invest some
NT$80 million in the project.</P>
      <P>Internet cafes have become a new line of business with tremendous
potential in Taiwan. However, authorities have found the business
involving high technology and entertainment very difficult to
regulate.</P>
      <P>A survey conducted by the Shiang-yang Foundation earlier this
year indicated that an estimated 120,000 high school and junior high
school students indulge in visiting Internet cafes.</P>
      <P>The survey of 9,935 students from 129 schools around the island
showed that 51 percent of the respondents said that they have visited
Internet cafes, while 45.5 percent said they are regular customers
who visit an Internet cafe at least once a week.</P>
      <P>The teenagers said they spend most of their time in Internet
cafes playing computer games and visiting online chat rooms. Less
than one out of ten said they access the Internet to visit adult
entertainment or gambling Web sites.</P>
      <P>Students' distraction from their studies and Internet access to
pornography and gambling have raised concerns among many parents and
education authorities. Internet cafes in Taiwan have been unable to
help bearing a bad name, especially when the cafes are linked to
reports such as gang fighting and the negatives effects of Internet
cafes on health.</P>
      <P>Many parents answering the survey questionnaire of the
Shiang-yang Foundation said that they would try to keep their
youngsters from visiting Internet cafes.</P>
      <P>The Kaohsiung businesspeople investing in the planned Internet
cafe plaza said they hope that the plaza will present a healthy image
of Internet cafes to the public.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs in April of this year put the
Internet cafe business under the category of "information-related
recreational businesses." However, a supervision mechanism has yet to
be established. Since the business involves Internet services,
computer business, data processing, and food and beverage services,
good coordination is needed among all the authorities concerned in
order to regulate the mushrooming business.</P>
      <P>A recently released research report by Capital Securities House
estimated that the Internet cafe sector's total revenue might reach
NT$13.6 billion next year. The booming sector is expected to help
stimulate growth in the broadband communications market as well as in
e-commerce.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  13  (CNA)
(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Academia Sinica President Lee Yuan-tseh
said Saturday that he has not promised any candidates that he will
stump for them during their campaigns for the Dec. 1 elections for
legislators, county magistrates and city mayors.</P>
      <P>The 1986 Nobel Prize winner for chemistry is regarded as a
powerful campaign stumper because of his prestigious reputation.</P>
      <P>During the presidential campaign in 2000, he openly threw his
support behind the Democratic Progressive Party's Chen Shui-bian,
helping Chen win the election by a slim margin.</P>
      <P>When asked by the media whether he will stump for any candidates
in the upcoming elections, Lee replied that "I have not promised to
stump for any candidates."</P>
      <P>As no single party is expected to win an outright majority in the
next Legislature, the ruling DPP and the opposition Kuomintang have
been struggling to become the party with the most seats in the
225-seat Legislative Yuan after the elections.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ECONOMIC GLOOM AFFECTS CAMPAIGN FUNDING (I)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  13 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The lingering economic gloom has affected
campaign funding for the upcoming elections for legislators and local
government chiefs.</P>
      <P>The pivotal Dec. 1 elections are just 49 days away, but campaign
activities have yet to heat up partly because of funding shortages.
In the past, major Taipei streets were dotted with campaign banners
and posters of candidates from different political camps long before
official campaign periods started.</P>
      <P>This year, few campaign banners, billboards, leaflets or posters
have so far been seen on streets or mailboxes of private homes as
cash-strapped candidates have cut spending on campaign literature.</P>
      <P>A candidate in a legislative race in metropolitan Taipei said
campaign literature is expensive and its effectiveness is dubious.
"At this time of economic hardship, I must adopt more effective
strategies, including mass rallies and other innovative methods, to
attract voters and promote my cause," he said.</P>
      <P>The protracted economic slowdown and a string of typhoon
disasters have made it extremely difficult for election hopefuls to
raise campaign funds.</P>
      <P>Apollo Chen, an incumbent opposition Kuomintang (KMT) lawmaker
who is seeking re-election in the Taipei southern precinct, said he
originally expected that the local stock market might stage a
comeback in autumn to help make fund-raising easier.</P>
      <P>"But the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in the United States and the
Typhoon Nari-triggered devastation have dampened any sort of stock
market rally. Now, I don't dare approach any potential donor for
contributions," he said.</P>
      <P>Chen Chi-mai, a ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
legislator who is seeking re-election in the Kaohsiung precinct, said
in the past he used to draw up a campaign plan and then move to raise
funds to finance the project.</P>
      <P>"This year, I have to reverse my work schedule. I must first see
how much money I can raise and then draft my campaign programs," Chen
said, adding that the slumping stock and property markets as well as
electronics industry woes have discouraged him from soliciting
financial support from the business community.</P>
      <P>Unlike the KMT, the DPP has few party assets. As a result, the
party has traditionally relied on organizing luncheons or dinners to
raise funds to finance various campaign activities.</P>
      <P>The DPP's "Mainstream Alliance" faction is scheduled to hold a
large-scale fund raiser Saturday evening. President Chen Shui-bian,
Premier Chang Chun-hsiung and DPP Chairman Frank Hsieh have all been
invited to attend. The alliance has prepared NT$50,000-per-person
dinner tickets with a goal of raising NT$100 million (US$2.9 million)
in cash to help finance its members' campaign programs.</P>
      <P>"Sales of the dinner tickets have fallen far short of our
expectations. Even the presence of our party heavyweights cannot help
boost our fund-raising drive," said Cheng Pao-ching, a legislator who
concurrently serves as the alliance's chief financier.</P>
      <P>According to Cheng, the alliance has so far sold only about NT$30
million worth of dinner tickets. The alliance now has some 50
legislative members. It originally hoped that each member could
distribute 100 tickets. But so far, few of its members have managed
to sell their quota, with some of them even failing to sell a single
ticket, alliance sources said.</P>
      <P>KMT candidates face similar financial restraints. Although the
KMT has been billed as the world's wealthiest party, its party assets
have dwindled substantially over the past year amidst the domestic
economic recession, party sources said.</P>
      <P>Worse yet, the sources said, the loss of its position as the
ruling party has seriously hindered the KMT's fund-raising efforts.
In the past, major local business groups never hesitated to make
generous political contributions to the party.</P>
      <P>As the current DPP government has repeatedly vowed to eradicate
the influence of moneyed interests and organized crime in domestic
politics, KMT sources said, many private companies are now reluctant
to donate funds to the party and its candidates.</P>
      <P>Many KMT candidates have traditionally relied on the party for
campaign funding. The party has so far twice distributed money to its
standard-bearers for the upcoming elections, but the amount
reportedly is only one-tenth that of the previous figure.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  13 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The three other opposition parties -- the People First Party
(PFP), the New Party (NP) and the newly formed Taiwan Solidarity
Union (TSU) -- have also had a hard time soliciting donations from
business groups. Candidates of the three parties have all had to try
to cash in on their respective party leader's personal charisma to
boost their fund-raising drives.</P>
      <P>PFP Legislator Chin Hui-chu, who is seeking re-election in the
Taipei northern precinct, organized an auction last week to raise
campaign funds. Initially, each item put up for auction could only
fetch between NT$10,000 and NT$20,000. But after PFP Chairman James
Soong arrived at the auction hall, items began fetching up to
NT$100,000, and even as much as NT$300,000.</P>
      <P>Encouraged by the marvelous results of the unprecedented campaign
fund-raising method, Chin said she plans to invite Soong, one of the
brightest stars in the local political arena, to attend another one
of her fund-raisers to be held later this month.</P>
      <P>In addition to stumping for PFP candidates, Soong has also been
traveling around the island to attend dinners organized by party
candidates to lend his support for their fund-raising drives.</P>
      <P>In comparison, TSU candidates have relied solely on the party's
spiritual leader -- former President Lee Teng-hui -- to help raise
campaign funds and even to boost awareness of their party.</P>
      <P>Lee's outspokenness and unique personal appeal have often
attracted large crowds to TSU campaign rallies where the party has
been selling a wide range of products, from lunch boxes and backpacks
to T-shirts, bearing Lee's trademark smiling face.</P>
      <P>Sales of these products has helped the new party raise NT$7.5
million so far, TSU sources said, adding that most of the buyers are
elderly voters and that sales are far more brisk in southern Taiwan
than in central and northern parts of the island. The trend fully
reflects Lee's support base, a political observer said.</P>
      <P>At campaign rallies, the TSU has also been selling books
featuring Lee's 12-year stint as the Republic of China's head of
state as well as his political views and life story. Among these
books, "An Account of Lee Teng-hui's Years in Office" has reportedly
been the best-seller.</P>
      <P>As many New Party candidates are political novices from the
academic community or from various professional fields, they have
also been relying heavily on the party's convener, Legislator Hsieh
Chi-ta, or several other party elders for financial support.</P>
      <P>Fund-raising difficulties have made candidates of different
political stripes become more budget-conscious. They have postponed
the opening of their campaign offices or have scaled down their
campaign headquarters. So far, many candidates have yet to open their
campaign headquarters.</P>
      <P>A number of candidates of the same party in the same precinct
have adopted a joint campaigning formula to share campaign spending.
They have shared campaign offices and have presented joint campaign
literature and advertisements.</P>
      <P>An advertising agency specializing in city bus advertising
business said it has lowered ad fees substantially in order to
attract candidates, but so far many city bus advertisement spaces for
campaign posters remain available. In the past, a company executive
said, city bus ad spaces were fully booked three months before the
elections.</P>
      <P>The grim domestic economic situation has also dampened local taxi
drivers' interest in and passion for election campaigning. Unlike
previous years, few taxi cabs have flown campaign banners or flags
for any of the candidates this year.</P>
      <P>Political observers said the effect of Taiwan's current economic
decline and mounting unemployment rate on campaigning for the
upcoming elections deserves further observation.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING BALKS AT TAIWAN'S CHOICE FOR ENVOY TO APEC SUMMIT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Shanghai,  Oct.  14  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Beijing official said Sunday that
Taiwan's departure from the tradition of having an economic leader
attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Corporation (APEC) forum gives
Beijing "difficulties" in deciding whether to accept Taiwan's
representative to the 2001 summit to be held in Shanghai on Oct. 20.</P>
      <P>Beijing's Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao, who doubles as
the news chief for the Shanghai APEC conference, made the comment in
Shanghai in response to questions about Beijing's attitude toward
Taiwan's proposal to have a former vice president, Li Yuan-zu, attend
the summit on behalf of the Republic of China's president, Chen
Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>Zhu said Taiwan had previously sent an economic leader to the
summit and said that Taiwan should follow its own protocol this time.
Taiwan's attempt to "break the pattern" by sending a high-profile
political leader has given Beijing pause before giving its approval
for Li to attend the meeting, Zhu said.</P>
      <P>He refused to say whether Beijing would reject Li, but said that,
"Li himself should know."</P>
      <P>The Liberty Times, a Taipei-based newspaper, said Sunday that
Beijing has reportedly refused to allow Li to attend the summit
because of his higher political status than that of the island's
former representatives at the summit.</P>
      <P>For the previous eight summits, Taiwan had sent an economic
official, such as the chairman of the Cabinet-level Council for
Economic Planning and Development, or a governor of the Central
Bank of China to the gathering to avoid any political backlash from
mainland China.</P>
      <P>Li is a current senior adviser to the president and has served as
education minister and justice minister before being elected vice
president in 1990 and retiring in 1996.</P>
      <P>Chiou I-jen, secretary-general of the Executive Yuan, refused to
comment on the Liberty Times' report Sunday morning, saying that the
Executive Yuan would wait until Beijing's decision on the matter to
make any response.</P>
      <P>Chiou made the remarks in Hualien, while accompanying Premier
Chang Chun-hsiung on an inspection tour in eastern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Kuomintang specialist on mainland Chinese affairs
Chang Jung-kung said if the Liberty Times' report is true, it
indicates that Beijing's policy toward Taiwan has its shortcomings.</P>
      <P>Chang told a symposium in Taipei on Taiwan's ties with mainland
China that Beijing's snub of Li would expose its contempt for the
feelings of the people on Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Denying Li access to the summit because of China's fear that
Taiwan is attempting to break free from past unfavorable practices
would cost Beijing a valuable chance to court the friendship of the
people of Taiwan, Chang said.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan is partly to blame for the current situation --
Taiwan did not seek counsel with mainland China on who it would send
to the summit -- there is a possibility that the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) is deliberately trying to polarize local
people against Beijing with the idea that this could be favorable for
the DPP in the year-end elections, according to the KMT strategist.</P>
      <P>A top DPP analyst of mainland Chinese affairs, Yen Chien-fa, said
that Taiwan, as a member of APEC, should not give up its right to
participate fully in all APEC activities because of the limitations
imposed on it by Beijing.</P>
      <P>Wu Jui-kuo, the People First Party's chief analyst for
international affairs, said the situation was regrettable but not
surprising given that Beijing maintains that the issue of Taiwan is a
domestic one that does not figure on the international stage.</P>
      <P>Although the issue of Taiwan's representative to the summit is
still pending, Minister of Economic Affairs Lin Hsin-yi and Chairman
of the Council for Economic Planning and Development Chen Po-chih
will head for Shanghai Monday as scheduled for an APEC ministerial
meeting between Oct. 17-18.</P>
      <P>They will exchange views with their counterparts from mainland
China and eight other member economies on trade issues and bilateral
free trade agreements and study ways to promote regional trade
liberalization as outlined in the 1994 Bogor Declaration which was
named after the Indonesian city where the APEC leaders met in 1994.</P>
      <P>The conclusions that emerge from the ministerial conference will
be put in a document titled the "Shanghai Accord."</P>

      <P>Lien, without mentioning Lee by name, said, "An old man who is
retired has been going around every day making outrageous remarks."
He said that although this old man stressed that he loves Taiwan, he
criticizes the government created in accordance with the Constitution
of the Republic of China and calls it an "alien regime."</P>
      <P>Lien said that, "Anyone who recognizes the Republic of China and
lives and develops under its system should not be differentiated in
terms of foreign or local."</P>
      <P>Lien stressed that the old man is pandering to the few, which he
said was "splitting the country." He also said that the remarks were
"heart-wrenching."</P>
      <P>With the approach of the year-end elections, Lee's comments about
the KMT and his successor as KMT leader have become more vitriolic,
according to observers.</P>
      <P>Lee told his supporters that the current political chaos is due
to the hindrance of the opposition, and because "someone" still
refuses to accept defeat in the 2000 presidential election. Lien
finished a distant third with just 2.9 million votes, next to
President Chen Shui-bian's 4.9 million votes and former Taiwan
Governor James Soong's 4.6 million votes.</P>
      <P>Lee has also criticized Lien without mentioning him by name by
saying that a person holding a Ph.D. degree in political science
should know better than to try to recall the president. Lee said that
this showed a lack of political common sense.</P>
      <P>The KMT, which originally refrained from commenting on Lee's
remarks, expelled Lee from the party in September and has recently
begun to refute his statements.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a former KMT secretary-general said Sunday that Lee
should feel sorry for calling the KMT an "alien regime."</P>
      <P>John Chang made the remarks at the inauguration of his campaign
headquarters in downtown Taipei for the year-end legislative
election.</P>
      <P>Chang noted that the late KMT Chairman Chiang Ching-kuo had long
promoted the idea of "localization," which aimed at integrating the
ethnic groups in Taiwan, but he said the "localization" promoted by
some has sought to drive a wedge between the peoples, and would
create differences between locals and mainlanders who came to Taiwan
in 1949 with the Nationalist government after it was defeated by the
Communists in the civil war.</P>
      <P>Chang, without mentioning Lee by name, said that someone's idea
of "localization" has twisted the true spirit of late President
Chiang.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT ASSETS OPEN TO PUBLIC SCRUTINY: SPOKESMAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  14  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Kuomintang (KMT) is willing to
compensate the country in compliance with the law should any of its
assets be found to have been acquired illegally, a spokesman for the
leading opposition party said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a news conference, Wang Chih-kang, head of the KMT's
Cultural Communication Committee, stressed that the KMT has acquired
all its assets in accordance with the law and that the party's
property is open for public examination.</P>
      <P>Wang called the news conference to explain the KMT's position
after the government led by the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
revealed its intention to reclaim KMT's assets which it said were
seized through improper means.</P>
      <P>Emphasizing that the government should pay heed to the country's
economic problems by seeking political stability with the opposition,
Wang described the move by the Cabinet as a "nothing but a campaign
trick" for the December's elections for legislative seats and local
government chiefs.</P>
      <P>Wang said that the trick would not help Taiwan's economy or its
political situation and would have a negative impact.</P>
      <P>According to the KMT spokesman, the DPP is fully aware of the
fact that the KMT has obtained all its property and assets through
legal means. If the ruling party wants to reclaim the KMT's assets,
it will need a legal base to do so, Wang noted, adding that it is
impossible for the legislature to enact a law allowing the seizure of
assets in a short time.</P>
      <P>Lawmaker Lai Shyh-bao of the New Party also said that a special
law could not be passed in the near-term.</P>
      <P>Criticizing the DPP for injecting "political strife" at a
sensitive time in the run-up to the year-end elections, Lai proposed
that the government move swiftly to resolve the problems related to
the vast government-owned land that is being illegally occupied or
misused by private individuals or agencies.</P>
      <P>According to Lai, a total of 74,831 hectares of government-owned
land has been illegally occupied as of the end of last year. He
stressed that the government should quickly act to handle the issue
if it is serious about its vow to return national property to the
people.</P>
      <P>DPP lawmaker Shen Fu-hsiung contended that the attitude of the
People First Party (PFP) will be critical following the ruling
party's plan to reclaim the KMT's assets, as the DPP seats at the
legislature for the time being are too few to pass the DPP's bills.</P>
      <P>In other words, Shen explained, the government would tone down
its voice should it decide to cooperate with the KMT to forge a
planned coalition government following the December legislative
elections. Otherwise, the government would remain unaffected and
increase its claim if it chooses another party in the plan to
cooperate with other parties.</P>
      <P>Against such a backdrop, the PFP will play a critical role as to
which extent it would support the KMT in the government's action to
reclaim its assets, he noted.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LEE TENG-HUI CLAIMS TO BE SUCCESSOR OF CHIANG CHING-KUO IN THOUGHT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  14  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former President Lee Teng-hui, who was
expelled from the party he led for 12 years, claimed Sunday that his
concept of "new Taiwanese" originated from the thoughts of late
President and KMT chief Chiang Ching-kuo.</P>
      <P>In a symposium in Taipei, the former KMT chairman said that his
"new Taiwanese," which expands the definition of Taiwanese to anyone
living on the island and intending to make the island their home,
rather than those who immigrated from the mainland before 1949, was
inspired by Chiang.</P>
      <P>He recalled Chiang saying during his later years in the
presidency that after living on the island for 40 years, "I have
already become a Taiwanese."</P>
      <P>Lee said: "That is the central idea of 'new Taiwanese.'"</P>
      <P>After Chiang died on Jan. 13, 1988, Lee said he decided to
harness the idea envisioned by Chiang to his own cause.</P>
      <P>He regretted that Chiang's family members and children were
oblivious to these thoughts of Chiang's.</P>
      <P>A native of Taiwan and educated in agriculture, Lee was recruited
by Chiang as a minister without portfolio in 1972, and then was
assigned in sequence to head the Taipei City Government, the Taiwan
Provincial Government and to be vice president.</P>
      <P>He succeeded Chiang as president and KMT chairman after Chiang's
death in 1988.</P>
      <P>Lee said he had written down every conversation that he had had
with Chiang since Chiang began grooming him as his successor by
naming him as his running mate in the 1984 presidential election, but
dared not publish the details of these meetings. Instead, Lee said
the conversations between Chiang and himself would be published by
his daughter after his death. He gave no reasons for wanting to
release the conversations in this way.</P>
      <P>Lee stepped down from the post of party chairman after his party
lost the presidential election last year and has distanced himself
from the party he led for 12 years for what he called the party's
deviation from its political principles.</P>
      <P>He recently began aggressively campaigning for candidates of the
newly formed Taiwan Solidarity Union and lambasted the KMT as an
"alien regime" colluding with Beijing to betray Taiwan.</P>
      <P>His rhetoric against the KMT forced the party to revoke his party
membership on Sept. 21.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN URGED TO APPROVE LOCAL AIRLINES' USE OF CHINA'S AIRSPACE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  14  (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Republic of China legislator urged the
government Sunday to allow its civilian airlines to fly over mainland
Chinese airspace on their way to European destinations to ensure the
safety of passengers.</P>
      <P>Legislator Elmer Fung from the opposition New Party made the call
in a news conference, saying that he will press the government to
consider the issue in his forthcoming interpellation in the
legislature.</P>
      <P>Fung just returned from a visit to mainland China, heading a
delegation of executives from six of Taiwan's civilian airlines.
After their talks with mainland Chinese aviation officials and
industry representatives, a consensus was reached that Taiwan
carriers could fly over mainland Chinese airspace for the security of
passengers following the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in the United
States, as well as for saving time and money for the airlines.</P>
      <P>He added that proposals by Taipei-based China Airlines and EVA
Airways to fly their European routes over mainland airspace have been
positively received by the mainland. Fung described mainland China's
willingness to release its "first aviation right" as a good will
gesture by Beijing authorities.</P>
      <P>"If the government approves this proposal, the airlines as a
whole can save approximately NT$500 million (US$14.5 million) per
year, and each ticket could be reduced by NT$3,000," Fung noted.</P>
      <P>Fung also urged the government to approve the proposal based on
the consideration of the security of the public and not get mired in
political ideologies.</P>
      <P>The aviation industries in both Taiwan and mainland China have
suffered immense losses in terms of time and money due to the fact
that direct flight services between the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait are still banned.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, ROC's Minister of Transportation and Communications
(MOTC) Yeh Chu-lan stressed Sunday that cross-Taiwan Strait aviation
rights negotiations should be conducted based on the condition of
equality and dignity, and any decision cannot be made unilaterally.</P>
      <P>Yeh pointed out that the government generally does not oppose
transport links with mainland China, however, these negotiations must
be done through authorized agencies.</P>
      <P>She added that the issues related to cross-strait relations are
usually handled by the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council, while
the MOTC takes care of the supporting and technical work.</P>

      <P>Mandarin Chinese has become the second
foreign language that Japanese college students think they should
learn, according to a survey released Saturday by Japan's Cabinet.</P>
      <P>The survey, which was conducted in July, received 3,450 valid

on university education.</P>
      <P>The results indicated that Japanese students prefer to learn a
language that is spoken widely and one that is used in a country
close to Japan.</P>

languages, university students should learn English first, followed
by 59.6 percent for Chinese, 26.5 percent for French and 25.6 percent

    <HEADLINE>MOFA BEHIND APEC ENVOY CHOICE: ECONOMICS MINISTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Shanghai,  Oct.  15  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
will decide who will lead the Republic of China delegation to the
Oct. 20-21 summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)
forum in Shanghai, Economic Affairs Minister Lin Hsin-yi said Monday.</P>
      <P>Lin noted that neither he nor Council for Economic Planning and
Development (CEPD) Chairman Chen Po-chi had participated in the
selection of former Vice President Li Yuan-zu as the original proxy
of President Chen Shui-bian at the coming summit. He added that
although he had no options for a suitable candidate, MOFA is fully in
charge of the issue.</P>
      <P>Lin made the remarks following his arrival in Shanghai for an
APEC ministerial meeting to be held Thursday.</P>
      <P>Mainland Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Zhang Qiyueh said
earlier the same day that she will negotiate with two ministers from
Taiwan on Taipei's representative at the APEC summit, but added that
Beijing insists that Taipei send an official with an economic
background in accordance with past practice.</P>
      <P>At the same time, MOFA spokeswoman Chang Siao-yue reiterated that
Li is Taipei's "sole choice" and called on the Beijing authorities to
respond favorably.</P>
      <P>She said that S.C. Shen, head of MOFA's International
Organizations Department who arrived in Shanghai Sunday for a senior
officials' meeting, was negotiating with the mainland Chinese side
over the issue.</P>
      <P>P.K. Chang, a former CEPD chairman and now a chief at the
opposition Kuomintang-sponsored Policy Research Foundation, said
Taiwan's selection of its representative at the APEC summit should
focus on the actual benefits the selection can bring rather than just
achieving superficial publicity.</P>
      <P>He said it would be best and would represent a breakthrough
should Li be allowed to take part in the summit.</P>
      <P>Commenting on Beijing's rejection of Li, Chang said it is obvious
that there had not been good coordination between the host country
and the Taiwanese side. From the point of view of precedence, he went
on, Taiwan usually sends a government official with an economic
background to the event.</P>
      <P>However, he said that Li, a criminal law expert and a senior
presidential advisor, would be an "adequate" candidate for the APEC
summit, the theme of which will center on anti-terrorism efforts,
according to Chang. However, he reminded relevant government
authorities that Li would need to be provided with sufficient
information on trade and economics to allow him to engage in
bilateral talks with envoys from other member states.</P>
      <P>Chang, who has taken part in several APEC summits on behalf of
the ROC head of state, declined a proposal that he himself could
represent the president at the coming APEC leaders' meeting, on the
grounds that he is no longer a government official or an official
policymaker.</P>

    <DATELINE>Honolulu,  Hawaii,  Oct.  15  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Gen. Chang Hsueh-liang, who
briefly kidnapped Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek in 1936 at the peak
of the Chinese civil war, died Monday in Hawaii at the age of 101,
according to his family.</P>
      <P>He was admitted to the Straub Hospital in Honolulu Sept. 28
suffering from pneumonia and moved to the intensive care ward Oct. 9
after his condition worsened.</P>
      <P>The hospital took him off a life-support system at the request of
his family late last week.</P>
      <P>Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian and Premier Chang
Chun-hsiung conveyed their condolences to Chang's family through
Taiwan's representative office in Honolulu after learning of his
death.</P>
      <P>Born in 1901, Chang graduated from a military academy in
northeastern China. In 1928, he succeeded his father, a warlord who
dominated northeastern China after the Republic of China was founded
in 1911, as leader of his father's militia, called the Northeastern
Army.</P>
      <P>In order to integrate the Northeastern Army into the forces of
the Nationalist government, Chiang, who led the nationalists at the
time, named Chang as the commander-in-chief of the army in
northeastern China in 1929.</P>
      <P>Chang and his followers were expelled from their stronghold when
the Japanese Imperial Army invaded China in 1931 and occupied
northeastern China. Chang, who was eager to drive the Japanese out of
northeastern China and reclaim his former fiefdom, was at odds with
Chiang, who wanted to use Chang's army to fight against the
burgeoning Chinese communists.</P>
      <P>The quarrel turned into a public brawl Dec. 12, 1936, when Chang
took Chiang hostage in Sian in an attempt to force him to join with
the communists to fight Japan.</P>
      <P>Ironically, Chang was persuaded by Chiang to give up his attempt
and submit himself to the Nanking-based Nationalist government for
discipline. Chang escorted Chiang to Nanking Oct. 25 that year,
ending the so-called Sian Incident.</P>
      <P>Chang was put under house arrest thereafter, first in Zhejiang
Province, then in Jiangxi Province and finally in Taiwan in 1946
after the nationalists fled from the communists.</P>
      <P>Chiang died in 1975 in Taiwan, but Chang's ordeal was not over
until 1988, when Chiang's son and successor, President Chiang
Ching-kuo, also died.</P>
      <P>Chang was granted relative freedom of movement within the island
in 1988 by then-President Lee Teng-hui and was allowed to move to
Honolulu in 1993, where he lived quietly.</P>
      <P>He celebrated his 100th birthday May 28, 2000 in Honolulu with
more than a hundred family members and friends from both Taiwan and
mainland China.</P>
      <P>Although he was blamed by the Nationalist government for giving
the Chinese communists a much-needed reprieve when they were on the
run from the nationalist forces, Chang has never returned to his
northeastern China homeland, despite repeated entreaties from
Beijing.</P>
      <P>Chang married twice, divorcing his first wife Yu Feng-chih in
1964 and marrying his longtime female companion Chao Yi-ti while in
captivity in Taiwan. Chao died in Honolulu June 23, 2000.</P>

      <P>Legislators at a meeting of the Legislative Yuan's Interior
Committee approved an amendment to the "Statute Governing the
Development of the Offshore Islands" that would lift a ban on people
from Taiwan proper traveling to and from the mainland by allowing
passage via either of the three Taiwan-controlled groups of islands
lying opposite the mainland.</P>
      <P>The government opened the "mini three direct links" -- trade,
postal and transport exchanges -- between Kinmen and Matsu and the
mainland port cities of Xiamen and Fuzhou at the beginning of this
year as a litmus test for the possible opening of full-scale links
between Taiwan and the mainland.</P>
      <P>Under the existing measures, residents of the two islands or
those who have listed their household registration on the island for
more than six months can sail to and from the mainland directly.</P>
      <P>The revised bill also includes Penghu along with Kinmen and Matsu
as the embarkation points for people from Taiwan traveling between
the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Although there is still a long way to go before the amendment is
signed to law by the president, the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) --
which charts Taiwan's mainland policy -- expressed immediate
reservations about the move. The bill has to pass second and third
legislative readings before it can be sent to the Presidential Office
for approval.</P>
      <P>MAC Vice chairman Teng Chen-chung said that the revision, if
adopted, would produce a total "door-opening" effect for the 23
million people of Taiwan and that his council will seek to have it
adopted step by step in order to minimize the possible negative
impact on the nation.</P>
      <P>In stark contrast to the government stance, several business
leaders hailed the amendment, saying it would greatly cut the cost
and time for cross-strait travelers, especially Taiwanese investors
on the mainland.</P>
      <P>Tai Sheng-tung, chairman of the Association of the Small- and
Medium-Sized Enterprises of the ROC, said that currently, a single
trip via either Hong Kong or Macau takes about seven hours and costs
NT$17,000 (US$480) in flights, while sailing through either Kinmen,
Matsu or Penghu would take only three hours at the most and cost
about NT$4,500.</P>
      <P>Most important, the local travel and transport industries would
also profit greatly from the new move by breaking Hong Kong's and
Macau's grip as embarkation points for Taiwan people traveling in and
out of the mainland. Hong Kong alone earns about NT$10 billion
(US$289 million) by serving mainland-bound Taiwan visitors annually,
Tai said.</P>
      <P>Echoing Tai's view, Hsu Sheng-hsiung, chairman of the Electrical
and Electronic Association, said that the new measures, if finalized,
would benefit most of the nearly 10,000 Taiwan investors in the
southern mainland province of Fujian.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FLIGHT DETOURS OVER MAINLAND  CHINA  NEED DISCUSSION: OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 15 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Any local airlines who wish to fly through
mainland Chinese airspace must seek permission from the Taiwan
authorities, Minister of Transportation and Communications Yeh
Chu-lan said Monday.</P>
      <P>Yeh said current laws forbid Republic of China aircraft, vessels
or other vehicles from flying, sailing, or passing through mainland
Chinese airspace, territory, or waters without ROC permission and the
mandate to waive these prohibitions rests not with the transport
ministry but with the Mainland Affairs Council and the Executive
Yuan, said Yeh.</P>
      <P>Taiwan air carriers' requests to fly through mainland Chinese
airspace on their way to Europe to save costs involve the Taiwan
government's power to regulate aviation rights and cannot be granted
by anyone other than the government.</P>
      <P>The government, meanwhile, will not accede to such requests
unless it can first consult with Beijing, Yeh said.</P>
      <P>She made the remarks after a local newspaper reported Monday that
the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) is set to
recommend its members to fly from East Asia to Europe via mainland
China rather than over India and Afghanistan in light of the U.S.
strikes in Afghanistan.</P>
      <P>The paper quoted sources at the International Air Transport
Association as saying that one-third of the flights between Asia and
Europe are routed via Southeast Asia, the Bay of Bengal, India,
Afghanistan and the Middle East.</P>
      <P>But business on this route was dealt a serious blow after the
U.S. launched strikes on the Taliban regime in Afghanistan on Oct. 8.</P>
      <P>As a result, the ICAO is mulling to divert the route to the four
mainland Chinese flight information zones of Kunming, Chengdu,
Lanzhou and Urumqi before flying over Siberia into Europe.</P>
      <P>About 2,600 km of this route is in mainland Chinese airspace,
over mainly highland, desert and mountain ranges.</P>
      <P>Only flights by Hong Kong-based Cathay Pacific Airways take this
route to Europe thus far, according to the ICAO.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is not a member of the ICAO and is not expected to be
informed of its recommendations for the detour. However, Beijing air
traffic officials promised Oct. 12 to open the route to Taiwan
carriers should they apply to use it.</P>
      <P>Opposition New Party lawmaker Elmer Fung, who brokered the Oct.
12 meeting between Taiwan carriers and Beijing officials, estimated
that the route over mainland China will save NT$500 million (US$14.5
million) per year for each of the two Taiwan air carriers that
provide services between Taiwan and Europe, resulting in a one-way
airfare reduction of NT$3,000.</P>
      <P>Beijing's unilateral gesture, however, was denounced by the
Taiwan authorities, who described the move as a political ploy to
downgrade the island into a mainland province.</P>
      <P>Officials in Taipei also blamed Beijing for trying to drive a
wedge between the Taiwan authorities and Taiwan air carriers.</P>
      <P>Beijing has boycotted any dialogue with the Taiwan authorities
unless it admits Beijing's claims that there is only one China, a
prerequisite Taipei will not accept.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Central Weather Bureau announced
Tuesday that although Typhoon Haiyan is expected to deviate further
away from Taiwan, the public should still remain on guard against
heavy rains and high tides brought on by the typhoon.</P>
      <P>Meteorologists said that Haiyan has been slowing down and has
continued to turn northward, which will cause it to narrowly miss the
island.</P>
      <P>As of 1:15 p.m., Haiyan was located approximately 280 kilometers
east of northern Taiwan, with a storm radius of 250 kilometers. It
was moving at 15 kilometers per hour in a north-northwesterly
direction but was slowing down to nine kilometers per hour and
turning toward a north-northeasterly course.</P>
      <P>Haiyan has been packing winds of about 130 kilometers per hour
near its center, with gusts of up to 165 kilometers per hour.</P>
      <P>Meteorologists said that rain and winds are expected to intensify
in northern and northeastern Taiwan toward Tuesday evening but that
the island is expected to be free of the typhoon's influence by
Wednesday night.</P>
      <P>All flights and some railway services between Hualien in eastern
Taiwan and the capital city of Taipei were canceled. Schools and
businesses were closed for Monday in northeastern Taiwan's Ilan
County.</P>
      <P>In ports around Taiwan, 403 fishing vessels carrying a total of
3,167 mainland Chinese fishermen took up shelter from the typhoon.</P>
      <P>The three-member crew of a Taiwan fishing vessel, the Hsinfusheng
No. 1, was rescued by an Air Force helicopter Tuesday morning after

    <HEADLINE>EPA TO CONDUCT THOROUGH SOIL POLLUTION INVESTIGATION AROUND ISLAND</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 16 (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Environmental Protection Administration
will conduct a thorough soil pollution investigation around the
island following two recent cases of cadmium-contaminated rice
paddies in southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In a previous soil sample investigation, the administration found
that a total of 1,024 hectares of land around the island were
contaminated with one or more of eight kinds of heavy metals --
namely arsenic, mercury, copper, zinc, lead, nickel, cadmium and
chromium. Arable land seriously polluted by heavy metals exceeded 300
hectares, according to the investigation.</P>
      <P>In early September, 1,800 kilograms of cadmium-contaminated rice
were found at warehouses of rice retailers in southern Taiwan. The
Environmental Protection Administration and the Council of
Agriculture traced the origins to a rice paddy in Huwei, Yunlin
County.</P>
      <P>Reports in recent days of a second cadmium-pollution case
involving four areas of rice paddies aroused the concern of
authorities. While tracing the cause of pollution, the Environmental
Protection Administration has decided to conduct intensive studies on
soil samples from polluted areas.</P>
      <P>In the process of industrialization and urbanization, Taiwan's
environment is losing ground to the growing population and to the
mushrooming number of manufacturing plants. Toxic industrial waste
has become the most damaging pollutant to arable land around the
island.</P>
      <P>Regarding the cadmium-contaminated rice paddy in Huwei region,
nearby chemical plants have been suspected by environmental
protection authorities of being responsible for polluting the area's
ground water. Some dye producing factories have been under
investigation, according to police.</P>
      <P>The investigation is expected to be completed within six months,
and the polluted areas will be placed under the strict control of the
authorities, according to Cheng Hsien-jung, director of the Water
Quality Protection Bureau.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC STANDS FIRM ON CHOICE OF APEC SUMMIT ENVOY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  16  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Vice President Li Yuan-zu remains
the Republic of China government's sole choice as its representative
to the annual informal leadership meeting to be held in Shanghai Oct.
20-21, a Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) spokeswoman said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>"Li is our only choice. We do not have any replacement, and all
relevant preparations are proceeding as scheduled," said Chang
Siao-yue, director of the MOFA's Department of Information and
Cultural Affairs.</P>
      <P>Chang said the ROC government decided after careful deliberation
to pick Li as President Chen Shui-bian's special envoy to the APEC
summit meeting.</P>
      <P>"We earnestly hope that mainland China can make a goodwill and
positive response to our decision," Chang said, pointing out that the
MOFA is continuing negotiations with mainland China through proper
APEC channels. "We look forward to seeing a final result as soon as
possible," he added.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, Chang said, relevant government agencies are
briefing Li on APEC-related affairs in preparation for his attendance
at the Shanghai APEC summit.</P>
      <P>Touching on Beijing's decision to exclude Taiwan and Hong Kong
from an anti-terrorism meeting of foreign affairs ministers of APEC
member states, Chang said the ROC is eager to play an active role in
the current global campaign against terrorism.</P>
      <P>Therefore, Chang said, the MOFA will spare no efforts in pushing
for Taiwan's participation in the meeting.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Presidential Office spokeswoman Kuo Yao-chi said
officials of the National Security Council and various financial and
economic agencies gave APEC-related briefings to Li Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Kuo reaffirmed Chang's statement that Li remains the ROC's sole
choice to attend the APEC summit. "Negotiations with mainland China
over the issue have not made any significant progress, but we have
not considered picking any replacement," she noted.</P>
      <P>Kuo said the controversy surrounding Taiwan's representation at
the APEC summit has attracted international media attention in recent
days. "We hope that the international community can pay heed to the
unfair treatment the ROC has endured in the forum," she added.</P>
      <P>APEC is one of the few international organizations that admit
both Taiwan and mainland China. But because of mainland China's
opposition, the ROC head of state has been unable to attend the
annual APEC summit in person and has had to name a proxy in his
stead.</P>
      <P>In the past, Beijing forced Taiwan to limit its representation at
APEC summits to an economics minister or a business leader. Last
year, Central Bank of China Governor Perng Fai-nan led the island's
delegation to the APEC summit in Brunei.</P>
      <P>As anti-terrorism is high on the agenda of the upcoming APEC
summit, Kuo said, President Chen hopes that Li, a criminal law
expert, can represent the ROC at the meeting to contribute his
expertise in the relevant field.</P>
      <P>Li, 78, has a doctoral degree in law from Bonn University in
Germany. He had been minister of justice before serving as the ROC's
vice president between 1990 and 1996. He is now a senior adviser to
the President.</P>
      <P>APEC groups Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, mainland China,
South Korea, the United States, the Philippines, Hong Kong,
Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea,
Peru, Russia, Singapore, Thailand, Taiwan and Vietnam.</P>

      <P>As the government is relaxing restrictions
to allow more agricultural land to be turned into industrial land or
residential areas, an agricultural official said Tuesday that the
regulations requiring a buffer zone between agricultural land and
developed sites must not be changed.</P>
      <P>Chen Hsi-huang, chairman of the Council of Agriculture, said that
industrial pollution has been a serious threat to Taiwan's
agriculture. He said that the government's regulations requiring the

to protect agricultural areas from pollution.</P>
      <P>In a proposal to revise the regulations on land for agricultural
purposes, the Council for Economic Planning and Development and the
Ministry of Economic Affairs have suggested a relaxing of the "buffer
zone" regulations to allow the industry more flexibility in acquiring
land.</P>
      <P>Insisting that arable land and agriculture must not be further
sacrificed in the process of industrialization, Chen said that the
Council of Agriculture will not give in on its position.</P>
      <P>Currently, some 880,000 hectares of land around the island is
used for agricultural purposes, and 750,000 hectares of that land is
privately owned, according to statistics compiled by the Council of
Agriculture.</P>
      <P>Approximately 4,000 hectares of arable land are turned into
industrial land or residential areas every year with the approval of

    <TEXT>
      <P>An Army spokesman said Tuesday that each of
the Army's various types of air defense missiles has achieved a
degree of precision that is compliant with combat-readiness goals.</P>
      <P>Maj. Gen. Wu Szu-huai said at a routine news conference at the
Ministry of National Defense that the Army's Tien Kung, Hawk and
Patriot missile batteries have all undergone a series of live-fire
testings earlier this year.</P>
      <P>Wu, who heads the combat operations department at the Army
General Headquarters, said that the successful test-firing of the
Patriot missile demonstrates that the Army now possesses a certain
degree of anti-missile capability.</P>
      <P>It was the first time that the Patriot was test-fired outside of
the United States.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Wu said that the Army has completed the formation of

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN BUSINESSMEN URGED TO HEED INVESTMENT RISK IN MAINLAND</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  16  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Investment by Taiwan businessmen in
mainland China has continued to grow, totaling US$2.12 billion in the
first nine months of this year, officials of the Investment
Commission under the Ministry of Economic Affairs said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Officials said the figure represents an 18.95 percent increase
from the same period last year.</P>
      <P>They noted Taiwan investment in the mainland totaled US$365
million in September alone, up 177 percent from the previous month,
which they attributed mainly to Formosa Plastic Group's investment
project worth US$48 million in Ningbo, Zejiang province to produce
ABS, a plastic product.</P>
      <P>Though Taiwan investment in the mainland has increased rapidly,
the officials urged businessmen not to overlook investment risk. They
said the mainland relies heavily on exports, though its export growth
is expected to slow down due to the sluggish world economy. They said
Taiwan businessmen had better make risk assessments and not be
overly optimistic.</P>
      <P>The officials also said that since March this year, Taiwan's
investment in the United States has continued to show negative growth
except in July.</P>
      <P>Investment in the United States in September totaled US$39
million, down 64 percent from the previous month.</P>
      <P>A noteworthy phenomenon is the dramatic increase of investment in
Canada, totaling US$243 million in the first nine months of this
year, up 63-fold from the same period last year.</P>
      <P>The top five destinations for Taiwan investment are the British
Virgin Islands and the Cayman Islands, the United States, Latin
America, Canada and Singapore.</P>
      <P>Overall, outbound investment other than to mainland China totaled
US$3.28 billion in the first nine months of this year, up 6.94
percent from the same period last year.</P>
      <P>The officials also reported that overseas and foreign investments
in Taiwan totaled US$4.06 billion in the first nine months this year,
down 28.3 percent from the same period last year.</P>
      <P>The officials said that affected by the global economic recession
and terrorist attacks in the United States, major investor countries
have dramatically cut back on overseas investment.</P>
      <P>The officials said that after the terrorist attacks, world
investors have been investing more conservatively, a trend they said
will delay economic recovery.</P>
      <P>Overseas Chinese and foreign investment in September totaled
US$214.5 million, down 27 percent from the same month last year.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Oct.   16  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The largest opposition party, the
Kuomintang, will launch a "return the money to the people" campaign
to counter the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's recent campaign
to uncover possible illegally acquired KMT assets, a spokesman of the
KMT said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chou Shou-shun noted that since the DPP took office in May 2000,
the national wealth has shrunken by NT$20.28 trillion, or an average
drop of NT$810,000 (US$23,340) per person.</P>
      <P>Chou pointed out that the DPP used the term "return the money to
the people" as its campaign theme last year, but during the past 18
months, it has in fact been "looting money from the people."</P>
      <P>He said the KMT will campaign on the theme through its local
branches, mobilizing the jobless to appeal for "the right to work,"
and for the public to "forsake the incompetent government."</P>
      <P>Chou said that during the one-and-half-year DPP reign, the
national economy has worsened because the government lacks a goal and
a clear sense of direction. Statistics by its think tank showed that
the loss of national wealth in the real estate market, stock market
and foreign exchange market alone reached NT$20.28 trillion, or
roughly the total amount of central government budgets over 15 years.</P>
      <P>Chou said that the these losses have not counted the huge losses
resulting from the suspension of the Fourth Nuclear Power Plant or
the intervention in the local stock market by the government funds.</P>
      <P>The KMT's campaign is seen as a counterattack against the DPP's
campaign on investigating the sources of KMT assets. The KMT has
responded by saying that this is another "campaign trick" by the DPP
in the run-up to the year-end elections.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.S. TO ORGANIZE BRAINSTORMING SESSION FOR SUBMARINE DEAL WITH ROC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Oct.  15  (CNA)
(By Jay Chen and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The U.S. military is scheduled to
discuss in Washington its decision to sell Taiwan eight
diesel-powered submarines with U.S. defense contractors, specialists
from outside the United States and a small group of Republic of China
military personnel, U.S. defense industry sources said Monday.</P>
      <P>It is unclear how many defense industry representatives will take
part in the meeting, slated for Tuesday. Several staff members of the
ROC military procurement mission stationed in the United States are
expected to attend the session.</P>
      <P>This will be the first time that the U.S. military has invited
defense contractors to discuss the plan since the Bush administration
agreed to a robust arms sale package to Taiwan in April, which
included the sale of eight diesel-powered submarines to help upgrade
Taiwan's naval defense capabilities in the face of mainland China's
mounting military threat.</P>
      <P>U.S. sources said the brainstorming session is mainly designed to
provide a forum for exchanges of views between U.S. military
personnel and defense contractors.</P>
      <P>During the session, U.S. military staff will brief defense
industry executives from the United States and other countries on the
ROC's naval defense needs and ask them to offer initiatives to help
Taiwan acquire diesel-powered submarines.</P>
      <P>As the United States itself has stopped producing diesel
submarines, it must seek the help of other countries in delivering
the ROC's submarine order.</P>
      <P>U.S. sources said although mainland China has been pressuring
countries capable of building older-style submarines not to cooperate
with the United States, the U.S. military is confident that it can
realize its plan by pooling its resources with foreign defense
contractors.</P>
      <P>Commenting on a Taiwan newspaper report that Taiwan would be able
to take delivery of the first diesel submarine from the United States
in 2010 at the earliest, U.S. sources said it is only a tentative
schedule jointly worked out by the two sides. The exact date will
depend on the manufacturing capability of the selected contractor,
Taiwan's budget plans and other relevant factors.</P>
      <P>In Taipei, a spokesman for the ROC's Navy General Headquarters
(NGH) has confirmed that a U.S. team familiar with submarine
technology visited Taiwan in late September to look into its naval
defense needs.</P>
      <P>"The two sides have reached a consensus on some procedural
issues," NGH spokesman Maj. Gen. Wang Chueh said, adding that the
U.S. military has posted a notice on its official Web site saying it
will host a presentation for qualified shipbuilders from around the
world Tuesday to introduce key points of its submarine deal with
Taiwan. Taiwan's state-owned China Shipbuilding Corp. (CSBC) has also
received an invitation.</P>
      <P>Wang said the United States will decide which shipbuilding group
will be contracted to build the submarines for Taiwan in six months.
If all goes well, he said, construction on the first submarine will
get under way in 2005 and the ship will be ready for delivery around
2011.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, CSBC executives have on many occasions expressed their
company's interest in landing the order to build the submarines for
the ROC Navy. CSBC officials said the company has experience in
building warships and repairing submarines. "If we can obtain a
blueprint and certain technology, we'll be able to build the eight
diesel submarines," said a CSBC executive.</P>

      <P>The Cabinet-level Environmental Protection

toxic gas attack on the Taipei Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) system.</P>

      <P>It will be Taiwan's first exercise aiming at preparing for
biological and chemical attacks carried out by terrorists, the

      <P>As of 5:30 p.m. Tuesday, Haiyan was located approximately 320

      <P>The weathermen lifted the land warning a half day earlier than
expected, as Typhoon Haiyan changed direction and was regarded as

    <HEADLINE>ROC LIKELY TO EXCHANGE TRADE OFFICES WITH MONGOLIA: PRESIDENT CHEN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 16 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Tuesday that
the Republic of China is likely to exchange commercial offices with
Mongolia to facilitate exchanges and cooperation.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks while meeting with a group of young
Mongolian politicians who are attending a month-long administrative
training class in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Chen said the ROC will also study the feasibility of opening its
job market to Mongolian blue-collar workers. Taiwan has allowed
imports of laborers from several Southeast Asian countries, including
Thailand, the Philippines, Indonesia and Vietnam.</P>
      <P>Because of a combination of complicated reasons, Chen said, the
people of Taiwan have many incorrect and unrealistic perceptions of
Mongolia.</P>
      <P>"After a visit to Mongolia in October 1999, I have come to
understand its true face and picture," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Noting that he has long been eager to forge closer ties with
Mongolia, Chen said he took the initiative to form a sisterly
relationship with Mongolia's capital, Ulan Bator, during his stint as
mayor of Taipei between 1994 and 1998.</P>
      <P>The sister-city ties have helped boost bilateral friendship and
eventually prompted the Mongolian government to grant landing visas
to ROC tourists and business people, Chen said. "Now would-be Taiwan
visitors to Mongolia no longer need to travel to Japan to apply for
visas with the Mongolian Embassy there," he added.</P>
      <P>Chen further said he feels that the current administrative
training workshop provides a good example for Taiwan-Mongolian
exchanges.</P>
      <P>"You are the first group of Mongolian youths to receive
professional training in Taiwan," Chen told his guests, adding that
the program marks the start of bilateral cooperation and that the ROC
will continue to sponsor such programs for Mongolian public
functionaries in the future.</P>
      <P>With a view to boosting bilateral trade and economic cooperation,
Chen said his administration is considering exchanging representative
offices or trade liaison offices with Mongolia.</P>
      <P>All of the participants to the first Mongolian administrator
training workshop, organized by the ROC's Mongolian and Tibetan
Affairs Commission, are secretaries-general of Mongolia's provincial
councils. Fourteen of the 18 Mongolian provinces have sent the top
day-to-day affairs managers of their legislative councils to attend
the training workshop.</P>
      <P>According to the ROC's existing statute on civilian exchanges
across the Taiwan Strait, Mongolians are deemed as mainland Chinese
people.</P>
      <P>Against this background, officials of the Council of Labor
Affairs (CLA) said if the government wants to allow imports of
Mongolian workers, the proposal must receive the consent of the
Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>CLA officials further said the expansion of import sources of
foreign laborers is one of the conclusions reached at the Aug. 24-26
Economic Development Advisory Conference.</P>
      <P>In addition to Mongolia, the officials said, North Korea and
Myanmar may also be added to the list of countries whose people can
be allowed to work in Taiwan legally.</P>

the southwestern Taiwan port of Putai to the mainland Chinese city of
Xiamen via the Republic of China's frontline island of Kinmen Tuesday
for a four-day religious tour.</P>
      <P>It was the third religious group to be allowed to make a direct
voyage to mainland China for religious purposes since the ROC
government opened its offshore defense outposts of Kinmen and Matsu
to direct trade, mail and shipping links with Xiamen and Mawei in the
southeastern mainland province of Fujian -- commonly known as the
"mini three links" -- at the beginning of this year.</P>
      <P>The group, composed of more than 300 pilgrims from the southern
Taiwan county of Chiayi, was jointly organized by three Taoist
temples in the county -- Peitien Temple, Paoan Temple and Huangluan
Temple.</P>
      <P>The group took with it more than 20 icons of folk deities to
their home temples. Most of the icons were taken to Taiwan from

first reading a day earlier of a draft revision bill to the existing
statute on the development of Kinmen, Matsu and Penghu, another
ROC-controlled island group in the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>According to the draft revisions, Taiwan residents would be
allowed to make direct voyages to mainland China via the three
outlying islands. Under the current "mini three links" regulations,
only Kinmen and Matsu residents can do so, while Taiwan residents
must apply for government approval on a case-by-case basis.</P>
      <P>Tsai said he hopes the draft revisions can finally pass the
legislative floor to help would-be Taiwan visitors to the mainland
save time and money, as well as boosting the economic development of
the three outlying islands.</P>

    <HEADLINE>2001 `TAIWAN E-COMMERCE WEEK' OPENS IN TAIPEI</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 16 (CNA)
(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The 2001 "Taiwan E-Commerce Week" opened at
a Taipei hotel Tuesday with about 1,000 experts and representatives
of the information-technology industry participating.</P>
      <P>ROC President Chen Shui-bian delivered a speech at the opening
ceremony in which he called the 21st century a "century of
information" and stressed the importance of the Internet to economic
development.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan's economy relies heavily on exports, Chen said, the
global trend of E-commerce cannot be neglected.</P>
      <P>He said the E-commerce week will demonstrate the results of an
ROC government project to promote E-commerce and help local
enterprises expand their IT know-how with foreign experts.</P>
      <P>The week's activities are being jointly organized by the
Institute for Information Industry (III), the Ministry of Economic
Affairs and RosettaNet.</P>
      <P>III Secretary-General Lin Feng-ching said that application of
E-commerce is a major step that is being taken by all countries to
improve their competitiveness.</P>
      <P>Although the development of E-commerce in Taiwan has been
affected by the dotcom crash since the second half of 2000 and the
slowdown of the U.S. economy, he noted that the role of the Internet
to economic development remains important.</P>
      <P>E-commerce week includes "E-Partners" from Oct. 17-18,
"E-Manufacturing" from Oct. 19-23, and "E-Commerce" from Oct. 24-25.

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT CHEN OPTIMISTIC ABOUT TIES WITH MONGOLIA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  16 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian might see one of
his dreams come true soon, as there is a good possibility that the
Republic of China and Mongolia will exchange trade offices in the
near future.</P>
      <P>Chen said he is very happy about a recent breakthrough in
bilateral relations and attributed the new development to his
profound friendship with former Mongolian Prime Minister Janlaviin
Narantsatsralt.</P>
      <P>Chen, who served as Taipei mayor from 1994-1998, visited Mongolia
in October 1999 for the first time, while Narantsatsralt paid a visit
to Taiwan a year later.</P>
      <P>Chen, who was elected the ROC's 10th president in March 2000,
recounted that he assured Narantsatsralt during a state banquet in
Taipei that the existing Taiwan-Mongolia and Mongolia-Taiwan
associations could serve as a starting point for the exchange of
trade and representative offices between the two countries.</P>
      <P>Claiming that he is not superstitious, the president revealed
nevertheless that everything went smoothly for him after he rode a
"horse of heaven" in Mongolia.</P>
      <P>The president made the remarks during a meeting at the
Presidential Office with 15 Mongolian youths who are taking part in
an administrative personnel workshop sponsored by the Cabinet-level
Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission.</P>
      <P>Chen also told them that the ROC government will study the
possibility of importing Mongolian workers to Taiwan to further
bilateral exchanges and cooperation.</P>
      <P>Lamenting that Taiwan's understanding of Mongolia is limited and
superficial, Chen voiced the hope that there will be a breakthrough
in two-way ties with the establishment of trade offices on either
side.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC PRESIDENT CALLS FOR CREATIVITY IN HANDLING `ONE CHINA' ISSUE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Berlin,  Oct. 16 (CNA)
(By James Kuo and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian
said recently that the leaders on both sides of the Taiwan Strait
should treat the "one China" concept in a creative manner.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks in an interview with Urs Schoettli, a
correspondent in Tokyo for the Swiss daily Neue Zurcher Zeitung.</P>
      <P>Chen said the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, split since the
late 1940s, must start with economic and cultural integration in
order to achieve eventual political integration.</P>
      <P>"And this process must be based on three principles -- democracy,
parity and peace," Chen stressed, adding that every possible solution
to cross-strait disputes must take into account the free will of the
people of Taiwan and that no party can resort to the use of force.</P>
      <P>Chen said that Taiwan has become a mature democracy, with its
people freely electing their head of state and political parties
vying for popular support by serving the general public.</P>
      <P>All these things remain unimaginable in mainland China, Chen
said, adding that Taiwan can serve as the vanguard of mainland
China's democratization.</P>
      <P>Chen lauded the mainland for its economic achievements through
market opening and trade reform under the leadership of its
patriarch, the late Deng Xiaoping, and mainland Chinese President
Jiang Zemin.</P>
      <P>Chen further said he is convinced that mainland China's economic
success will be followed by social and political reforms after its
accession to the World Trade Organization in the near future.</P>
      <P>"I firmly believe that mainland China will pursue freedom and
democracy in the long run," Chen said optimistically.</P>
      <P>The Swiss daily ran an article, titled "Will Taiwan Become the
Vanguard of Mainland China's Democratization?" on the front page of
its Oct. 13-14 weekend issue, and published the full text of
Schoettli's interview with Chen on its international news page.</P>
      <P>In the interview, Chen also mentioned that he has been awarded
Liberal International's 2001 Prize for Freedom, but complained that
Denmark bowed to pressure from the mainland China and refused to
grant him a visa, dashing his hopes of traveling to Denmark next
month to receive the award in person.</P>
      <P>"They awarded me the Prize for Freedom, but they took away my
freedom to travel," he said.</P>
      <P>The Liberal International, an alliance of more than 80 liberal
political parties from more than 60 countries, commended Chen for his
"solid record as a human rights activist" and his contributions to
democracy on the island.</P>
      <P>Chen, a former human rights lawyer, defended an opposition leader
who narrowly escaped the death penalty at a sedition trial in 1980
for organizing a demonstration in defiance of a now-scrapped ban on
street protests.</P>
      <P>Chen went on to become a member of the Legislative Yuan and the
mayor of Taipei. He swept to power in presidential elections in March
2000, ending more than five decades of one-party rule.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  16 (CNA)
(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Four Taiwan automobile manufacturers have
decided to invest a total of NT$38.6 billion to establish research
and development centers under the guidance of the Industrial
Development Bureau (IDB) of the Ministry of Economic Affairs.</P>
      <P>An IDB official said that the plans will greatly improve the
island's international auto manufacturing competitiveness.</P>
      <P>Despite the fact that the number of vehicle transactions in
Taiwan this year is not expected to exceed 350,000, the official said
the IDB has helped Yulon Motor, China Motor, Kuozui Motors and Ford
Lio Ho Motor to establish R&amp;D centers that will go into operation in
2002 and 2003.</P>
      <P>The total investments by the four automakers will amount to
NT$38.6 billion -- with Kuozui Motors putting up the highest amount
of NT$14 billion.</P>
      <P>Ford Motor Co. of the United States will provide an efficient
compact production system to Ford Lio Ho and dispatch specialists to
train local staff with the aim of developing Taiwan as its Asian R&amp;D
center.</P>
      <P>Yulon Motor will match this with a plan drawn up by the Asian
Technological Center to develop an R&amp;D center that will serve as
Nissan Motor's Asia-Pacific design center, while cooperating with
nine yet to be selected satellite plants.</P>
      <P>China Motor will introduce a comprehensive productivity
management system from Japan and Kuozui will adopt Toyota Motor's
management system to set up their R&amp;D centers.</P>
      <P>With the establishment of these centers, the IDB official noted,
Taiwan is likely to become a major automobile R&amp;D center in Asia in
the future.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  16  (CNA)
(By David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The sales volume of automobiles and
motorcycles in Taiwan this year will decrease sharply due to the
sluggish economy, officials of the Industry Development Bureau (IDB)
under the Ministry of Economic Affairs said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The officials estimated that the sales volume of automobiles will
decrease to 350,000 from the 420,000 recorded last year, while the
volume of motorcycle sales will drop to 610,000 from last year's
700,000.</P>
      <P>The IDB also predicted that the impact of Taiwan's admission into
the World Trade Organization (WTO) on its automobile and motorcycle
industry will be minor.</P>
      <P>Local sales of automobiles and motorcycles reached a high in
1996, with automobile sales hitting 560,000, and motorcycle sales
standing at 1.17 million.</P>
      <P>According to an evaluation by the automobile industry, domestic
demand for automobiles should reach an annual average of 500,000. The
figure of 350,000 estimated for this year will probably be the
lowest, according to automobile industry sources, who added that the
volume will bottom out and rally next year.</P>
      <P>Because Taiwan will only cut tariffs on imported cars by 1
percent after it enters the WTO, such imports will not account for a
bigger market share in Taiwan in the future, according to the IDB
officials.</P>

      <P>Taiwan atmospheric scientists Tuesday
successfully obtained vital typhoon data by flying two remote-control
aircraft close to the depression's eyewall, a world first for any
flying object collecting meteorological information.</P>
      <P>The first remote-control aircraft, or "aerosonb I" in atmospheric
science jargon, was launched at 7 a.m. Tuesday to a location only
about 150 kilometers away from the eyewall of Typhoon Haiyan, which
was about 200 kilometers from Ilan, eastern Taiwan. The plane
successfully transmitted meteorological information about the typhoon
to its designers and controllers on the ground.</P>
      <P>After staying aloft for a record 108 kilometers, the drone
crashed at 11:25 a.m. after transmitting the information, the
meteorologists said.</P>
      <P>The second drone -- "aerosonb II" -- was launched at around 2
p.m. Tuesday on a similar mission. It landed safely at 4:30 p.m.
after having also successfully collected vital information about
Typhoon Haiyan, which left the island in the late afternoon.</P>

      <P>A fuel oil trade war is expected to break

      <P>Taiwan is set to increase its sources of
foreign laborers, Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) Chairwoman Chen Chu
said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>About 300,000 foreign laborers, mostly from the Philippines,
Thailand, Indonesia and Vietnam, are employed in Taiwan at present.</P>
      <P>Chen said that CLA has contacted the authorities in Myanmar,
Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Cambodia, North Korea and Mongolia to discuss
the possible import of laborers from those countries.</P>
      <P>Among those countries, Chen said, Myanmar and Cambodia are likely
to be chosen as additional sources of foreign labor simply because of
the advantage of direct flights between Taiwan and these two
countries.</P>
      <P>She said that Taiwan is also likely to list Mongolia as a source
of labor as a result of the warming relations between the two
countries.</P>
      <P>Chen went to on say that the CLA is considering setting a quota

on what extent those foreign governments cooperate with Taiwan with

      <P>The CLA recently adopted a new wage system for foreign workers by

    <HEADLINE>CANADIAN P.M. TO TRY TO SHORE UP APEC'S ANTI-TERRORISM STANCE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  Oct. 16 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien will
meet with the Malaysian and Indonesian heads of state in Shanghai
this coming weekend to try to shore up the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation forum's anti-terrorism stance, Canadian officials said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The APEC leaders plan to issue a strong statement denouncing the
terrorist attacks in the United States at this weekend's informal
APEC leadership summit where the topic of terrorism is expected to
overshadow almost everything else.</P>
      <P>The APEC summit in Shanghai will be the first overseas meeting
for both Chretien and U.S. President George W. Bush since the Sept.
11 attacks.</P>
      <P>The APEC leaders will also discuss the slumping economies of many
member countries, but much of the discussion is expected to be about
shoring up support for Bush's international coalition against
terrorism, according to the officials.</P>
      <P>"This has to be on the agenda, even if it is informal," said one
Canadian official during a background briefing.</P>
      <P>Chretien will do his part, the officials said, by meeting with
representatives of several member countries Sunday to talk about the
coalition. Most notably, he plans to meet with leaders from Indonesia
and Malaysia, both predominantly Muslim countries where there has
been unrest over the U.S.-led bombing of Afghanistan.</P>
      <P>Chretien also plans to meet one-on-one with Bush, Russian
President Vladimir Putin, Mexican President Vicente Fox and others,
they noted.</P>
      <P>One senior Canadian official said that the APEC leaders are
expected to be unanimous regarding the declaration, adding that the
drafting process has been smooth, despite reservations from some
countries about the U.S. approach to handling the terrorism crisis.</P>
      <P>Mainland China has insisted it will not allow the issue of
terrorism to dominate this week's meeting, and discussions will go
ahead on the economy and the future of the APEC organization. A
declaration is expected in favor of a new round of negotiations on
multilateral trade liberalization.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHEN TO CONFER PRESIDENTIAL AWARDS ON FOUR SOCIAL GURUS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 17 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Three individuals and one aboriginal group
have each been selected as recipients of the Presidential Cultural
Award in recognition of their exceptional contributions to Taiwan
society, awards organizers said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian is scheduled to confer the Presidential
Cultural Award in mid-December at a ceremony to be held at the
Presidential Office on Buddhist philanthropist Master Cheng Yen,
Taiwanese linguist Wu Shou-li, physician-turned-sociologist Lin
Tsung-yi and the Shan Mei Community Development Association, said
officials from the National Cultural Association (NCA).</P>
      <P>The prestigious Presidential Cultural Award, the first of its
kind, is a manifestation of one of the commitments Chen made to the
Taiwan public after he took office last year to help reinvigorate
cultural development and raise moral standards in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The four Presidential Cultural Award recipients will serve as
role models for the Taiwan public by allowing their spirit of
contribution to society and the light of their wisdom to inspire
members of Taiwan society, particularly those of the younger
generation, NCA officials said.</P>
      <P>Master Cheng Yen, founder of the Buddhist Compassionate Relief
Tzu Chi Foundation, is a Buddhist nun-turned-philanthropist whose
compassionate and charitable operations reach every corner of the
globe.</P>
      <P>Cheng Yen and her followers started their philanthropic
activities in 1966 with only a tiny amount of funds saved from
handicraft work. In 1973, the Tsu Chi Charity Clinic was established,
offering free medical care to the poor and needy. The clinic became a
general hospital six years later. Tzu Chi volunteer workers were one
of the major factors helping Taiwan stand up again after the
devastating magnitude 7.3 earthquake struck in September 1999.</P>
      <P>Wu Shou-li, 92, is the most senior recipient of the first
President Cultural Award. A Taiwanese scholar who received a Japanese
education in his early life when Taiwan was under the colonial rule
of Japan, Wu taught in National Taiwan University's Department of
Literature for decades while doing research on the southern mainland
Chinese dialect of Fujianese, from which the Taiwanese dialect is
derived.</P>
      <P>Despite his advanced age, Wu managed to publish his double-volume
Madarin-Taiwanese Dictionary last year after decades of painstaking
work. The dictionary is considered an important cornerstone in
dialect studies in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Dr. Lin Tsung-yi, 81, was the first Taiwanese person to receive a
doctorate in philosophy from a university in the United States. Lin
had been an adviser to the World Health Organization for years before
committing himself to working as a sociologist in Taiwan after the
tragic Feb. 28 Incident, in which his father, formerly the director
of the NTU Department of Literature, was killed.</P>
      <P>From that time, Lin became the leader of Taiwan's sociological
activities, particularly in efforts at seeking justice for the
families and offspring of victims of the Feb. 28 Incident.</P>
      <P>The Shan Mei Community, a village of the aboriginal Tsou tribe
located south of Mount Ali in central Taiwan, was also chosen to be a
recipient of the award for its strenuous and painstaking efforts at
saving the Taiwan Ku fish -- an endangered species endemic only to
Taiwan's mountainous regions and a distant relative of the carp.</P>
      <P>The Tsou villagers have spent years working to save the species
by keeping the fish's habitat intact and continuing to promote the
concept of conservation among other groups of people around the
island, according to the award organizers.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN TOURISM GROWS AMID ECONOMIC SLUMP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  16  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Despite the economic sluggishness in the
local and world markets, the local tourism industry still posted
growth in the first half of this year, according to statistics
released Wednesday by the Tourism Bureau.</P>
      <P>Tourist arrivals and departures, as well as domestic travel, all
registered increases during the first six months of the year compared
with the levels posted during the same period of a year ago,
according to the bureau.</P>
      <P>During the January-June period, the people of Taiwan made a total
of 3.7 million visits abroad, while tourist arrivals in Taiwan
totaled 1.38 million, up 3.67 percent and 10.64 percent,
respectively, year-on-year, bureau tallies show. In addition, Taiwan
people made 54.4 million trips at home around the island during the
same time, up 2.8 percent from the year-earlier level.</P>
      <P>Some 80 percent of Taiwan's first-time outbound tourists paid
visits to destinations in Asia. Hong Kong was the most popular choice
in Asia for tourists from Taiwan, absorbing 31.6 percent of Taiwan's
total outbound travel, according to the statistics. Asian visitors
also accounted for the bulk of foreign inbound travel for Taiwan,
with Japanese tourists accounting for 37.5 percent of the total.</P>
      <P>Tourism Bureau officials also said the bureau will launch a major
publicity campaign to create a new image for Taiwan in a bid to draw
a greater number of Japanese tourists. The officials said they hope
to meet the target of 10-percent growth in foreign inbound travel for
the whole of 2001.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SUSPECTED VOTE-BUYING UNDER INVESTIGATION: JUSTICE MINISTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  17  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Justice Minister Chen Ding-nan said
Wednesday that while selling tickets for admission to
election-oriented fundraising banquets is not illegal, the practice
of buying a great number of tickets or of receiving such tickets may
constitute vote-buying.</P>
      <P>Chen declined to speculate on whether Vice President Annette Lu
was involved in such a suspected vote-buying fund-raiser, but said
after people filed a complaint with the Taipei District Prosecutors'
Office that similar cases are currently under investigation.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks after opposition Kuomintang Legislator Chen
Chien-chih asked him during an interpellation session at the
Legislative Yuan whether Lu is involved in vote buying.</P>
      <P>In the complaint to the Taipei prosecutors, Lu was accused of
putting up NT$1.8 million (US$52,173) for three tables at a
fund-raising banquet sponsored by the "Mainstream Alliance" faction,
a sub-group of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party. Each ticket
was priced at NT$50,000.</P>
      <P>Chen has strenuously promoted a "clean election" in the approach
to elections for legislators, city mayors and county chiefs slated
for Dec. 1.</P>
      <P>He defended his justification for a NT$30 maximum standard for
vote-buying violations earlier this month, saying that the decision
will not be altered despite widespread criticism from the candidates.</P>
      <P>Chen said the decision to prosecute candidates caught spending
more than NT$30 on any individual for vote-buying was made by the
State Public Prosecutor General's Office after a consensus was
reached with prosecutors general and leading prosecutors at all
levels.</P>
      <P>He reiterated that the government is determined to ensure that
the year-end elections are not sullied by gifts of money or goods in
exchange for votes -- standard practice in Taiwan politics.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN 3G LICENSES TO BE AUCTIONED AT YEAR-END</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Oct.   17   (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Ministry of Transportation and
Communications officials announced Tuesday that the five licenses to
operate third-generation (3G) mobile phone services will be auctioned
at the end of this year, with the price tag set between NT$4.2
billion and NT$7.6 billion.</P>
      <P>The officials said the ministry will begin to accept applications
Friday, with a Dec. 18 deadline. At least seven local
telecommunications and wireless telecommunications service companies
are known to be interested in bidding -- Chunghwa Telecom, Teco
Electric and Machinery, ET Group, First International Telecom Group,
Far Eastone, Taiwan Cellular Corp. and KG Telecommunications.</P>
      <P>Before the auction, a special committee will conduct preliminary
qualification screening, a ministry spokesman said.</P>
      <P>The communications ministry has set the price tag of two licenses
for 35MHz spectrum at NT$7.6 billion each, with another 35MHz license
priced at NT$6.7 billion due to possible interference. The bidding
price for the 40 MHz license is NT$ 7.5 billion, and for the 25MHz
license, NT$4.2 billion.</P>
      <P>By auctioning the five licenses, the national treasury is
expecting to fetch NT$33.6 billion.</P>
      <P>In setting the bidding prices, the ministry has taken into
consideration long-term telecommunication developments in Taiwan and
the utility rate, in addition to the current international economic
climate, according to Teng Tien-lai, director of the ministry's Posts
and Telecommunications Department.</P>
      <P>Teng said that the bidding prices of Taiwan's licenses were
comparatively lower than those in other countries in the Asia Pacific
region.</P>
      <P>The 3G services -- also known as UTMS (universal mobile
telecommunications system) services -- offer instant wireless network
services for multi-media communications. With 7.2 million Internet
users and a high proportion of 2G mobile phone users, Taiwan is seen
as potentially rich market for 3G mobile telecommunications services.</P>
      <P>A research report conducted by the Ministry of Transportation and
Communications and the Council for Economic Planning and Development
forecast that the production value of the telecommunications sector
by the year 2010 will have reached NT$322.2 billion.</P>
      <P>The 3G mobile telecommunication services will facilitate the
development of e-commerce and related Internet services, according to
the report.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  17 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The majority of local people do not think
that mainland China will take advantage of the current U.S.-led
counter-terrorism campaign to invade Taiwan, according to the results
of an opinion poll released Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The telephone poll of 1,077 randomly selected adult residents was
conducted by Yok Mu-ming, an opposition New Party candidate in the
Dec. 1 legislative elections.</P>
      <P>The survey results show that 64 percent of those interviewed do
not think that mainland China will attack Taiwan amid the ongoing
U.S.-led strikes against the Taliban in Afghanistan in retaliation
for the Islamic country's sheltering of Osama bin Laden, the
suspected mastermind of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on the United
States.</P>
      <P>But if mainland China really were to launch an attack on Taiwan,
45.2 percent said they think that the United States would send troops
to assist Taiwan in repulsing an invasion by communist troops.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, 36.5 percent said they do not think that the United
States would be likely to come to Taiwan's aid.</P>
      <P>More than 70 percent said they support the current U.S. military
action in Afghanistan, according to the survey.</P>
      <P>The poll also found that 50.3 percent approve of President Chen
Shui-bian's response in the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks
that toppled New York City's World Trade Center and damaged the
Pentagon, the U.S. military's nerve center.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 45.3 percent said they are generally satisfied with
the ROC government's overall performance in the wake of the Sept. 11
attacks.</P>
      <P>According to the same poll, 63.9 percent said they do not think
that Taiwan will fall victim to terrorist attacks. Asked what would
happen if Taiwan were to be attacked by international terrorists,
54.6 percent said they think that the government may not be capable
of handling the situation and 64.9 percent said they do not think
that the government has the ability to fight against biowarfare.</P>

    <HEADLINE>REFORM GROUP CALLS ON POLITICAL PARTIES TO SOLICIT SUPPORT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  17 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A non-profit group trying to monitor the
assets of political parties called on the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party and other parties Wednesday to solicit support for
its cause.</P>
      <P>Officials of the National Reform Alliance to Monitor Assets of
Political Parties made the call during a meeting with DPP Deputy
Secretary-General Hsu Yang-ming.</P>
      <P>The alliance seeks to persuade the country's political parties to
support its appeals to "return the money to the people." It also says
that political parties should refrain from holding stocks or real
estate and that their assets should be in the form of cash deposited
in banks.</P>
      <P>Hsu signed the agreement on behalf of the DPP, stressing that
even if the DPP is the subject of such monitoring, it is "positive"
about the appeal for transparency.</P>
      <P>Hsu also said that opposition Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan
stressed before the presidential election in March 2000 that all
political parties must stop profit-seeking activities, starting with
the KMT.</P>
      <P>But Hsu noted that the KMT has refused to work with the Executive
Yuan's decision to investigate questionable KMT assets, which Hsu
said has "completely reneged on Lien's promise."</P>
      <P>Hsu said that because of the incomplete legal basis for such
monitoring, there will be some hurdles to be crossed. He said that
all political parties will have to support the enactment of a
"political party law" and a "political fund management law," as well
as formulating special relevant laws in the interest of the people.</P>
      <P>The DPP was the second political party to receive a visit from
the alliance. The Taiwan Solidarity Union, a political group formed
in August, was visited earlier this month.</P>
      <P>The alliance, comprised of professors, lawyers and accountants
and inaugurated last year, later called on the New Party and the
People First Party to solicit their support.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  17  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei's misery index was gauged at 4.53
percent in the first eight months of this year, the Taipei city
government's Department of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DBAS)
reported Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The figure was higher than Kaohsiung City's 3.89 percent and
Taiwan Area's average of 4.52 percent recorded in the same period,
according to DBAS officials.</P>
      <P>It was also 0.44 percentage points higher than the figure posted
for the same period of last year, the city officials added.</P>
      <P>The misery index is a composite of the unemployment rate and
inflation rate. High unemployment and inflation during the period
pushed the index up, the officials noted.</P>
      <P>The average jobless rate during the eight-month period stood at
3.68 percent, lower than Kaohsiung City's 4.73 percent and Taiwan
Area's average of 4.22 percent, they said. However, the officials
pointed out that the city's consumer prices rose by 0.85 percent
while Kaohsiung City and Taiwan Area's consumer prices declined by
0.84 percent and 0.30 percent, respectively.</P>
      <P>Taipei City's misery index was recorded as 5.58 percent in the
month of August, with inflation growing by 1.03 percent and
unemployment rising to 4.55 percent, the DBAS officials said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan, along with Japan and Singapore, have the lowest misery
ratings in the world, according to the officials.</P>
      <P>A high misery index cuts national income and is considered a
"hidden worry" for the government, they added.</P>

Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS).</P>
      <P>The analysis noted that the number of locally operated financial
institutions has fallen considerably in past years, from 1,952 at the
end of 1996 to 1,778 last year. These institutions include credit
cooperatives of counties or provincial cities and credit departments
of farmer's or fishermen's cooperatives.</P>
      <P>With the liberalization of the financial market, many of these
institutions have sought to upgrade their operations through mergers
or through transforming into commercial banks.</P>
      <P>They have faced increasing competition from newly established
commercial banks and business shrinkage has forced quite a few out of
the market, according to the analysis.</P>
      <P>At the end of last year, deposits at these banking institutions
accounted for 13.9 percent of the total deposits of Taiwan banks,
while the loans extended by them represented only 8.7 percent of
total bank lending in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Non-performing loans have caused serious problems for the locally
operated banking institutions. At the end of last year, the amount of
overdue loans held by these institutions totaled NT$204.2 billion,
with the overdue loan ratio rising from 8.6 percent to 15.7 percent
in four years.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN MARKET SHARE IN U.S., JAPAN DROPPING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 17 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Hit by the recessions in the United States
and Japan, market shares of Taiwan-made products in the two countries
have dropped in the first seven months of this year, according to
government statistics.</P>
      <P>Tallies published recently by the Cabinet-level Directorate
General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) show that the
market shares of locally made products in the United States and Japan
fell by 0.38 percentage points and 0.32 percentage points,
respectively, during the January-July period, compared with the
year-earlier levels.</P>
      <P>During the same seven-month period, the market share of Japanese
goods in the U.S. market fell from 12.05 percent to 11.17 percent,
while South Korea and Singapore also saw shrinkages of 0.27
percentage points and 0.24 percentage points, respectively, according
to the tallies. Taiwan enjoyed only a 2.95 percent market share in
the United States, down by 0.38 percentage points from a year ago.</P>
      <P>In the Japanese market, U.S.-made products grabbed the largest
stake of 15.48 percent, ahead of mainland China, which was in second
place during the same seven-month period. Taiwan seized fourth place
with a 4.37 percent market share in Japan, down from 4.69 percent a
year ago.</P>
      <P>According to DGBAS officials, the economic slump in the United
States since the fourth quarter of last year has noticeably slashed
the country's demand for hi-tech products. East Asian economies,
including Taiwan, all rely heavily on hi-tech exports to the United
States, they noted.</P>

    <HEADLINE>JUSTICE MINISTER VOWS `ZERO TOLERANCE' CAMPAIGN AGAINST VOTE-BUYING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 17 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Justice Chen Ding-nan pledged a
"zero tolerance" campaign against vote-buying Wednesday, with the aim
of eradicating the influence of moneyed interests and organized crime
in politics, more commonly known as "black gold" politics.</P>
      <P>Chen made the vow in a report on the ongoing anti-black gold
campaign at a meeting of the Legislative Yuan's Judicial Affairs
Committee.</P>
      <P>Noting that vote-buying is the root cause of black gold politics,
Chen said law-enforcement authorities will not compromise on the
vote-buying crackdown in the run-up to the pivotal Dec. 1 elections
for legislators, city mayors and county magistrates.</P>
      <P>"We are determined to wage a sustained war on vote-buying as a
first step toward wiping out black gold politics," Chen said, adding
that the Ministry of Justice (MOJ) will not intervene in the
investigation of any vote-buying charges.</P>
      <P>With Taiwan entering a red-hot election campaign season, Chen
said the MOJ has drawn up a comprehensive work plan to eradicate
vote-buying.</P>
      <P>Chen said the action pack includes revisions of the existing
regulations to increase the reward money for those who provide
information regarding suspected vote-buying cases and for law
enforcers who contribute to the cracking of vote-buying cases.</P>
      <P>In addition, Chen said, the ministry has launched an all-out
anti-vote-buying publicity campaign and has deployed personnel for
information gathering.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, he went on, the MOJ has endeavored to forge a
consensus among prosecution, police and investigation agencies on
vote-buying probes.</P>
      <P>Chen further explained that although the MOJ has the power to
oversee the administration of prosecutors' offices around the
country, it is not authorized to exercise administrative supervision
of any specific vote-buying case under investigation.</P>
      <P>"As the MOJ strictly abides by the regulations that permit the
offering of general operational directives to prosecutors' offices as
well as oversight of their operations after the closure of a specific
criminal case, political interference in vote-buying probes are
unlikely to take place," Chen assured lawmakers.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that black gold politics have had a profound and
far-reaching adverse impact on social justice and have even
undermined national strength, Chen said the MOJ will not cease in its
anti-vote-buying crusade.</P>

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Amid a rising unemployment rate, the
Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) reported Wednesday that it has paid a
total of NT$4.7 billion in labor unemployment benefit in the first
nine months of this year.</P>
      <P>According to the Cabinet-level agency, the figure was nearly

year. The figures rose from NT$1.66 billion and 24,018 people,
respectively, in 2000.</P>
      <P>The council predicted that it might have to pay NT$7 billion in

    <HEADLINE>CABINET APPROVES EXTENSION OF INSURANCE GUARANTEE FOR AIRLINES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  17 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet approved a proposal Wednesday
for a two-month extension of the current government guarantees for
the island's airlines on insurance claims for accidents caused by
hijacking or war.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet approved the proposal, which was presented by the
Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC) at its weekly
meeting.</P>
      <P>According to the proposal, the government's war-risk insurance
coverage guarantees for local carriers will remain valid until
midnight of Dec. 25 this year.</P>
      <P>The proposal will soon be referred to the Legislative Yuan for
endorsement, Cabinet sources said.</P>
      <P>MOTC officials said the ministry came up with the proposal mainly
because of the ongoing U.S.-led war on terrorism in retaliation for
the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in New York and Washington.</P>
      <P>With the escalation of the U.S. strikes on the Taliban in
Afghanistan in retaliation for the regime's sheltering of Osama bin
Laden -- the suspected mastermind behind the Sept. 11 attacks -- MOTC
officials said the commercial aviation insurance market is not
expected to return to normal for the time being.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, the officials went on, the government's
war-risk insurance coverage guarantees for local airlines must be
extended for another two months to help domestic carriers weather the
difficulties.</P>
      <P>In the wake of the terrorist attacks on America, international
underwriters have raised aviation insurance premiums across the board
and have slashed the maximum third-party liability compensation to
US$50 million.</P>
      <P>The government's financial guarantee will give the nation's
airlines temporary coverage above that amount in the event of any
claims resulting from hijackings or war, while giving the companies
time to negotiate new contracts with insurance companies.</P>
      <P>The U.S. government and a number of other governments around the
world have already pledged to help their aviation industries through
their difficult times by providing similar financial aid packages.</P>
      <P>The Republic of China government first offered a 30-day war-risk
insurance coverage guarantee to domestic carriers on Sept. 26, which
will end Oct. 25.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 17 (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Independent lawmaker Lo Fu-chu was elected
Wednesday as one of the three conveners of the Legislative Yuan's
finance committee, after weeks of procedural disputes centered around
the frequently controversial lawmaker.</P>
      <P>Only two days after an attempt to elect the conveners -- which
ended in arguments over the validity of certain ballots -- the
committee's members were finally able to complete the voting process
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) lawmaker Lin Wen-lang
received five votes to ensure his election to one of the three seats.</P>
      <P>Although the vote counting was initially stalled by arguments
over another ballot validity issue, Lin -- who served as the
temporary chairman -- cited relevant laws and ruled that a disputed
ballot for opposition Kuomintang (KMT) legislator Gary L.L. Wang was
valid, ensuring that Wang also received five votes to become the
second committee convener.</P>
      <P>After a ballot for Lo was ruled to be invalid, he was forced to
enter a tie-breaker with KMT lawmaker Lee Shang-ren, who, like Lo,
received four valid votes.</P>
      <P>Lee drew the first lot but lost, thereby handing the last
convener seat to Lo.</P>
      <P>After the results were announced, Lee held a news conference in
which KMT caucus whip Lee Cheng-chong said that the caucus was sorry
that the failure of two other KMT lawmakers to show up at the voting
led to only one KMT legislator being voted convener.</P>
      <P>Because Lo received one decisive vote from a KMT lawmaker to
ensure his victory, the KMT whip added that the caucus will look into
the matter and report the lawmaker who did not support the
caucus-appointed candidate for disciplinary measures if the lawmaker
is found to have violated party rules.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, DPP legislative caucus convener Lin Feng-hsi said at a
news conference after the voting that his caucus is "regretful" that
Lo was elected despite his party's attempt to prevent Lo's victory.</P>
      <P>Lin said that the DPP had even backed the failed KMT candidate
with three votes, yet another KMT lawmaker helped Lo become elected.</P>
      <P>He added that the KMT should discipline the lawmaker who did not
vote for his caucus-appointed candidate.</P>
      <P>On Oct. 3, Lo had harangued and intimidated members of the
finance committee because the DPP legislative caucus had questioned
the validity of electing his son, Lo Ming-tsai, as a convener of the
committee.</P>
      <P>The junior Lo, also a legislator, had been elected to the
committee's convener seat earlier this month for a third consecutive
term, breaking an internal rule of the chamber that forbids any
lawmaker serving as a convener of any committee for three straight
sessions.</P>
      <P>The senior Lo's invective halted the committee's plan to conduct
a new run of convener elections on that day.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Premier Chang Chun-hsiung
said Wednesday that the recent preliminary legislative move approving
an amendment allowing people from Taiwan to visit mainland China via
Kinmen and Matsu is "inappropriate."</P>
      <P>He told a Cabinet meeting that the government's policy of
promoting "mini three links" between the two islands and mainland
Chinese ports has been implemented since early this year in
consideration of the need and convenience of Kinmen and Matsu
residents.</P>
      <P>Chang said that if everyone in Taiwan were allowed to visit
mainland China via Kinmen and Matsu, it could adversely affect the
security of the two islands.</P>
      <P>Therefore, the premier asked the leaders of relevant government
organizations to step up communications with the Legislative Yuan to
prevent the amendment from being enacted.</P>
      <P>An amendment allowing the authorities of the offshore islands to
approve the operations of tourist hotels and casinos was also
approved in the preliminary legislative move.</P>
      <P>Regarding this, Chang said that the government has not yet

    <HEADLINE>EX-VICE PRESIDENT REMAINS TAIPEI SOLE OPTION FOR APEC SUMMIT: MOFA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  17  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei is negotiating with Beijing on
Taiwan's representative to the upcoming summit of the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum in Shanghai and a final decision
may come Thursday, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>But MOFA spokeswoman Chang Siao-yue reiterated that former Vice
President Li Yuan-zu remains Taipei's sole option for the coming APEC
summit this weekend and urged Beijing to respond to the offer
favorably.</P>
      <P>According to Chang, Taipei is negotiating with the mainland
Chinese side on the issue in the hope of following the so-called "Koo
Chen-fu model." She added that other details are flexible, such as
Li's title.</P>
      <P>Koo, chairman of the Taipei-based Straits Exchange Foundation
(SEF), participated in APEC summit various times as the ROC top
representative. The SEF is a semiofficial organization authorized by
Taipei to deal with Beijing in the absence of official contacts.</P>
      <P>Beijing has rejected Taipei's offer to send Li as Chen's
representative at the Oct. 20-21 APEC summit on the grounds that
Taiwan's envoy must be an official with an economic background as
stated in the 1991 APEC memorandum of understanding and according to
past practice.</P>
      <P>Responding to Beijing, Chang said the 1991 agreement should not
be applied to APEC economic summits, which started only in 1993.</P>
      <P>As the issue is still being discussed between the two sides, MOFA
officials are reluctant to speculate on possible other candidates to
attend the meeting. Regarding the much-talked about "Koo model," the
officials said there is still much to consider and the model needs
further definition.</P>
      <P>Koo was able to attend the APEC summit in the past as the proxy
of ROC president after being given the additional title of "senior
commissioner of the Council for Economic Planning and Development."</P>
      <P>MOFA officials said there are four options for Taiwan at present
-- push to allow Li to attend the meeting, select another
representative, appoint Council for Economic Planning and Development
(CEPD) Chairman Chen Po-chih or Minister of Economic Affairs Lin
Hsin-yi, who are already in Shanghai as the envoy, or skip the
summit.</P>
      <P>The ROC government should choose wisely who it ultimately sends
to the summit because to miss the meeting would be too high a price
to pay, P. K. Chiang, a former CEPD chairman, said.</P>
      <P>Chiang, who took part in APEC summits in the past on behalf of
ROC presidents, called on the government to act prudently because
Taiwan's insistence on its selection for representative may shut the
door for Taiwan's participation this year.</P>
      <P>Chiang said the government should carefully weight the issue as
there is not much time left. "Actually there are many options worth
considering by the government," he noted.</P>
      <P>Mainland Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Wang Guangya said earlier
the same day that Taiwan can take part in this year's APEC summit as
long as it dispatches an envoy in agreement with the 1991 memorandum
of understanding and past practice.</P>
      <P>Wang also said the example set by Koo, cannot be viewed as a
precedence.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the CEPD said the Executive Yuan may assign Li as its
"senior commissioner" to help push for his representation as Chen's
proxy at the summit.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN EXPERT SAYS LARGE-ENOUGH WAR WILL HELP ECONOMIC REVIVAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 17 (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An expert said Wednesday that if the scope
of the U.S.-led military strikes against Afghanistan is large enough,
the global economy would have an opportunity for revival.</P>
      <P>Wei Duan, former government director-general of Budget,
Accounting and Statistics, said in an interview that mankind
currently lacks the experience and ability to resolve the problem of
another great depression through peaceful means.</P>
      <P>From a historical point of view, he said, a huge economic bubble
emerged in the 10 years before the Great Depression that hit the
United States in 1929, when U.S. stocks crashed by 90 percent.</P>
      <P>It was only after seven years of depression that the onset of
World War II finally single-handedly shortened the gap between
production and sales that grew over the years, he added.</P>
      <P>Wei said that the current situation is very similar, with Japan's
stock index losing three-quarters of its value after starting the
previous wave of global economic bubbles.</P>
      <P>When the U.S. economy was likewise slipping, the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks came, becoming what Wei said could be called "the
straw that broke the back of the world economy."</P>
      <P>Prior to 1960, he continued, the world economy would switch from
bull to bear every three to five years. However, he said that between
1960 and 2000, the world economy has been in a continuous upswing
because when the Japanese economic bubble burst, the U.S. dot-com
bubble immediately took over.</P>
      <P>Therefore, he said that the global economy looked good generally,
and that people were barely aware of the misery that usually comes
when the economy hits rock bottom.</P>
      <P>Wei went on to say that although many U.S. financial and economic
experts have predicted that the U.S. economy will see a very quick
V-shaped rebound, others believe that the prospects for the U.S.
economy can only be optimistic if the American consumers have not
lost confidence.</P>
      <P>He said that the U.S. consumer confidence index has already
dropped from the previous high of 140 points to below 100, which is
considered rare in recent years. This is mainly because with the
onset of war, people cut down on spending and started to save.</P>
      <P>Wei predicted that American consumer expenditures could continue
to shrink, which would be very unfavorable to a U.S. economic
recovery.</P>
      <P>For Taiwan, he said, the public should be ready for a protracted
economic slump because the four major sources of domestic income --
salaries, rent, interest and investments -- will continue to drop,
and the economic growth rate will continue to be adjusted downward.</P>
      <P>Wei said that many companies in Taiwan are cutting their
employees' salaries or even downsizing. The unemployment rate
continues to grow and salaries continue to shrink, he added.</P>
      <P>Because the central bank has adjusted downward its interest rates
several times, We said, the interest rates for certificates of
deposit have dropped below 3 percent, affecting interest income.</P>
      <P>With the continued slump in the property market, he went on, rent
has gone down instead of up.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, he added, businesses have been seeing their profits
drop, affecting investment income as well.</P>
      <P>Wei said that Taiwan's exports rely heavily on the electronics
industry, but Taiwan's electronic information products have been
unable to find buyers with the current U.S. economic slump.</P>
      <P>He added that new investments in Taiwan so far this year
registered 30 percent less than the same period last year,
demonstrating a key factor leading to the negative economic growth
rate this year.</P>
      <P>He said that it will be difficult to achieve the government's
estimated 4.16 percent annual economic growth for 2002.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ENVOY TO POSTPONE DEPARTURE FOR SHANGHAI APEC SUMMIT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  17  (CNA)
(By Bear Lee)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs said
Wednesday evening that the nation's envoy for the informal summit
meeting of this year's Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum
will not leave for Shanghai as scheduled on Thursday.</P>
      <P>The ministry said in a news release that as Taipei has yet to
receive a formal invitation from Beijing, the sponsor of the summit,
the envoy, Senior Presidential Adviser and former Vice President Li
Yuan-zu, and his entourage will postpone their departure.</P>
      <P>Beijing has objected to Taiwan's offer of Li as its top envoy at
the summit, scheduled to open at the weekend, on the grounds that Li
lacks an economic or financial background.</P>
      <P>Due to Beijing's past threats of boycott, Taiwan has been
represented at past APEC summits by senior economics officials,
rather than its presidents.</P>
      <P>The ministry said that it is still negotiating with Beijing
regarding the nation's envoy at the summit.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a CNA dispatch from Shanghai quoted Taiwan officials
attending the APEC-related meetings as saying that the Taiwan envoy
and the entourage will arrive in Shanghai Friday afternoon.</P>
      <P>However, the officials did not elaborate whether Li will remain
as the top Taipei envoy, or if there will be someone else in his

    <TEXT>
      <P>After nine months of clean-up work
following an oil spill near the Lungkeng Ecological Preserve in
southern Taiwan's Kenting National Park, the preserve will be
reopened to tourists starting Oct. 20, although only 200 visitors
will be allowed to enter per day.</P>
      <P>Back on Jan. 14, the Greek-registered bulk carrier Amorgos ran
aground off the coast near Kenting National Park, spilling roughly
1,150 tons of fuel oil into the water.</P>
      <P>Three kilometers of coastline, from the Lungkeng Ecological
Preserve to the rocky cliffs at Oulanbi, was seriously polluted. The
ensuing clean-up work among the coral reefs was extremely difficult
to carry out.</P>
      <P>In addition to residents in the neighboring area, 1,600 soldiers
were mobilized to help in the clean-up effort.</P>
      <P>A spokesman of the Kenting National Park administration said
Thursday that although marine life in the area has been showing signs
of revival, it would take time for a total rehabilitation.</P>
      <P>Located on Hengchuen Peninsula at Taiwan's southernmost tip,
Kenting National Park, with its coral reefs and coastal tropical
rainforests, is renown for its natural beauty.</P>
      <P>The 60-hectare Lungkeng nature preserve was set aside for the
purpose of academic research and environmental education activities,
and only a limited number of visitors are allowed to enter the area
each day.</P>
      <P>Those who wish to apply for permission to enter the nature
preserve for environmental education activities must submit an
official application at least two weeks in advance.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING'S BREACH OF APEC PROTOCOL REGRETTABLE: PRESIDENT CHEN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 18 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Thursday that
mainland China's gross breach of the well-established protocol of the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum is extremely
regrettable.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks in telephone conversations with
Chinese-American Congressman David Wu (D-Ore.)</P>
      <P>The president said mainland China has so far not sent any special
envoy to Taipei to forward him an invitation to this year's APEC
informal leadership meeting, scheduled to be held in Shanghai Oct.
20-21.</P>
      <P>Worse yet, Chen said, mainland China has not even sent any formal
invitation to him. "Its breaking of the established APEC protocol is
very regrettable," Chen told Wu.</P>
      <P>Because of Beijing's complete disregard of the APEC protocol,
Chen said, the Republic of China delegation to the annual gathering
of the top leaders of the 21 APEC member states has had to postpone
its departure for Shanghai.</P>
      <P>Chen recalled that last year's APEC summit host, Brunei, twice
sent its special envoy to Taipei to present him with an invitation
letter.</P>
      <P>The president placed phone calls at his office Thursday morning
to three Democratic members of the U.S. House of Representatives --
Nancy Pelosi, who was recently elected the Democratic Party whip in
the House, as well as Rep. Howard Berman and Rep. Wu.</P>
      <P>During the conversations, Chen reiterated the ROC government and
people's condemnation of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks that brought
down the twin towers of New York City's World Trade Center and
partially damaged the Pentagon in Washington, D.C.</P>
      <P>Chen also reaffirmed the ROC's adamant support for the current
U.S.-led anti-terrorism campaign.</P>
      <P>He congratulated Pelosi for her election as the House minority
leader and invited her to visit Taiwan again to help boost bilateral
exchanges.</P>
      <P>For his part, Rep. Wu told Chen that he had originally planned to
go to Shanghai together with U.S. President George W. Bush to attend
the annual APEC events. "But I had to give up the plan as the Bush
delegation didn't include any members of Congress," he said.</P>
      <P>President Chen told Wu that he also hoped to attend the annual
APEC summit in person. But Chen said he had to shelve the plan simply
because of political reasons.</P>
      <P>Both Taiwan and mainland China joined APEC in 1991, and mainland
China has used its larger political muscles to block the ROC
president from attending the group's annual summit meeting. As a
result, the ROC president has traditionally had to designate a
stand-in, usually an economics official, to represent him at the
occasion.</P>
      <P>This year, Chen picked former ROC Vice President Li Yuan-zu to
attend the APEC summit on his behalf. Chen said he believes that Li,
a criminal law expert, would best be able to contribute to the
meeting because counter-terrorism will be a main topic of discussion
in APEC summit in Shanghai.</P>
      <P>Although mainland China has not publicly described its specific
objections to Li's attendance, it appears that his background in
politics is the main problem. If Li attends the APEC summit, it will
set a precedent of Taiwan sending a representative who has held a
high-ranking political position.</P>
      <P>Taiwan hopes to solve the problem by saying that Li will
represent Taiwan as a consultant to the Cabinet-level Council for
Economic Planning and Development.</P>
      <P>The ROC used this title before when tycoon and elder statesman
Koo Chen-fu attended three APEC summits from 1995-97 on behalf of
then-President Lee Teng-hui, and Taipei is asking Beijing to agree to
the "Koo Chen-fu model" again.</P>
      <P>The octogenarian Koo is also the chairman of the Straits Exchange
Foundation, a quasi-official body that handles relations with
mainland China in the absence of official ties. But Koo did not use
this title when he attended APEC.</P>
      <P>The two sides were still discussing the issue Thursday morning,
and it was not immediately known whether mainland China would accept
Li's new title.</P>
      <P>Since ending his six-year stint as vice president in 1996, Li,
78, has stayed out of the public eye, and during his career, he was
known for keeping a low profile.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC BELIEVES U.S WILL NOT COMPROMISE TAIWAN FOR CHINA'S SUPPORT: MOFA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  18 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China government believes
in the U.S. commitment to separating its anti-terrorism campaign from
the Taiwan Strait issue, a senior Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Stanley Kao, director of MOFA's North American Affairs
Department, made the remarks amid mounting concerns about the
possibility that the United States could compromise Taiwan's
interests in exchange for mainland China's cooperation in the current
U.S.-led war on global terrorism.</P>
      <P>Kao said U.S. President George W. Bush's trip to Shanghai is
mainly to attend the annual informal leadership meeting of the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum to seek expansion of
the anti-terrorism coalition.</P>
      <P>Prior to his departure for Shanghai, Bush said during his meeting
with mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin, he will reaffirm to
Jiang the U.S. support for the "one China" policy as well as its
desire to see a peaceful solution to all disputes between the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Kao said several senior Bush administration officials, including
Secretary of State Colin Powell, has also made reassurances that the
United States would not seek mainland China's support for the
anti-terrorism campaign at the expense of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"We believe in the sincerity of the United States in promising
not to mix up its counter-terrorism drive with the Taiwan Strait
issue," Kao said, adding that relevant U.S. officials have on many
occasions reaffirmed similar commitments to the ROC.</P>
      <P>Commenting on a Washington Post report that the Bush
administration was considering waiving sanctions that bar sales of
military-related equipment to mainland China, Kao said MOFA is trying
to obtain more information about the report.</P>
      <P>In his view, Kao said the cross-strait balance of military power
is critical to the ROC's national security. Noting that the United
States has consistently attached great importance to Asia-Pacific
regional stability and security, Kao said the robust U.S. arms sales
package to Taiwan struck in April this year signifies that the United
States is serious about security in the region.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, Kao said, the ROC government is optimistic
about defense cooperation with the United States.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a foreign wire service report from Shanghai quoted a
senior U.S. Department of State official as saying Wednesday that the
Bush administration has no plans to ease sanctions against mainland
China.</P>
      <P>The U.S. official told reporters traveling with Powell en route
to Shanghai for an APEC meeting that he unequivocally denied the
Washington Post report that said the Bush administration was
considering such a move, specifically to allow sales of spare parts
for mainland Chinese-owned helicopters as another weapon in the U.S.
war on terrorism.</P>
      <P>"There's no such sale or waiver contemplated," he said.</P>
      <P>The Post quoted U.S. officials as saying the White House was
considering a waiver of sanctions imposed after the 1989 Tiananmen
Square crackdown in Beijing to allow the sale of parts for Black
Hawks that Washington sold to mainland China in the 1980s.</P>
      <P>It said the helicopters were designed for high altitudes typical
of much of mainland China, including its Afghan border. Afghanistan
is now under U.S. bombardment for refusing to hand over the chief
suspect in the Sept. 11 attacks on New York and Washington,
Saudi-born dissident Osama bin Laden.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China has not acted in line with
the obligations of a host country of the informal leadership meeting
of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, a spokeswoman
of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Chang Siao-yue said that as Beijing has reservations about the
government's choice of former Vice President Li Yuan-zu to head the
delegation, it has yet to send a formal invitation.</P>
      <P>The ROC delegation, which was scheduled to leave for Shanghai for
the Oct. 20-21 meeting Thursday, will have to delay their departure,
Chang said, adding that the government is now consulting with
mainland authorities on the matter, but so far no headway has been
made.</P>
      <P>She stressed that Li was chosen after careful consideration, and
that his background as a criminal law expert would contribute to
discussions on anti-terrorism, which will be on the agenda at the
summit meeting. The government is still hoping that Li will represent
President Chen Shui-bian at the meeting, she added.</P>
      <P>On Beijing's insistence that Taiwan must act in accordance with
past practices and a memorandum of understanding in 1991 to send
officials with economic or financial backgrounds to the regional
meeting, Chang said that the informal leadership meetings were not
convened until 1993, and the memo of understanding in 1991 should not
govern in this situation.</P>
      <P>Both Taiwan and mainland China joined APEC in 1991, but Beijing
has used its political clout to block ROC presidents from attending
the group's annual summit meeting. As a result, ROC presidents have
traditionally had to designate a stand-in, usually an economic
official, to represent the president.</P>

(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>This year's production at the Tainan
Science-based Industrial Park is expected to reach NT$48 billion,
showing a 100 percent increase over that of last year, an official
with the park said Thursday.</P>
      <P>As the plants of some major manufacturers, including Taiwan
Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and United Microelectronics Corp.,
have been completed, the official noted that the industrial park's
output next year may rise to NT$80 billion.</P>
      <P>If the global economic recovery comes earlier than expected, he
went on, the 2002 output might even reach NT$100 billion.</P>
      <P>The Tainan industrial park is the largest such facility in
Taiwan, covering 1,600 hectares. Construction projects for the first
phase started in July 1996 and will be completed in 2005, or five
years ahead of the original schedule.</P>
      <P>The projects for the second phase will be completed in 2011 and
the projects for the Luchu development will be completed in 2010.</P>
      <P>At present 62 plants have been established at the Tainan
industrial park -- 20 of them being the expanded plants of the
semiconductor manufacturing companies located at the Hsinchu
Science-based Industrial Park.</P>
      <P>Of the 62 plants, 25 have started full operations. Their revenues
in the first eight months of this year were NT$28.6 billion, up 195
percent over the same period last year. The output for the whole of
2001 is estimated at NT$48 billion.</P>
      <P>The official said the effects of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks
on New York and Washington on the Tainan industrial park were not so
severe as those on the Hsinchu industrial park.</P>
      <P>He estimated that the revenues of the Tainan industrial park in
the September-October period alone would amount to NT$10 billion.</P>

      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) announced
Thursday that 66.5 percent of the 12-year-olds examined in a
DOH-sponsored study on teenager oral hygiene last year have tooth
decay or missing teeth, an improvement over 20 years ago.</P>
      <P>Of the 5,700 elementary and middle school students examined, the
average number of decayed or missing teeth among 12-year-olds is
3.31, with 54.3 percent of those teeth already treated.</P>
      <P>According to the DOH, 85.1 percent of 12-year-olds in 1981 had
tooth decay or missing teeth. The average number of tooth decay or
missing teeth was 3.76, with only 10.4 percent of those teeth
treated.</P>
      <P>The World Health Organization standard goal for oral hygiene is
achieving a nationwide average figure of less than three decayed or

      <P>An eastern Taiwan hospital extracted bone
marrow from two donors Thursday and found a number of interesting
coincidences among the donors and the recipients on the mainland.</P>
      <P>Hualien Tzu Chi Hospital completed the 316th and 317th bone
marrow surgeries Thursday. The first bone marrow donor was a
21-year-old male college student, and his recipient will be a
39-year-old male in the mainland with leukemia. The second donor was
a 28-year-old female, and her recipient a 27-year-old female in the
mainland.</P>
      <P>Tzu Chi said that both donors were born on Oct. 28, while the two
recipients both sought donors on March 28 this year. They also had
other interesting similarities.</P>
      <P>Both donors traveled to Hualien Tzu Chi on August 14 to have
physical examinations, and they took the same flight to the hospital

      <P>The extracted bone marrow will be sent to a university
hospital in Zhejiang. The same doctor is treating the two patients on

      <P>The majority of local people are
pessimistic about the prospects for a government campaign to
eradicate the influence of organized crime in domestic politics,
according to the results of a public opinion poll released Thursday.</P>
      <P>The telephone poll of 1,012 adult residents randomly chosen from
throughout the island, conducted by Open magazine from Oct. 8-11,
found that 85 percent of the respondents said they do not think that
organized crime's influence in local politics could be completely
rooted out.</P>
      <P>Although President Chen Shui-bian campaigned on a policy platform
against the influence of moneyed interests and organized crime in
politics, commonly known as "black gold," survey results showed that
58 percent said they had not seen any improvement in containing
organized crime's influence in domestic politics.</P>
      <P>Only 38.77 percent said they had seen some progress in preventing
organized crime from interfering with local political affairs since
President Chen assumed office in May 2000.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 38.08 percent said they think that organized crime's

serious in the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>About 50 percent said they think that many candidates for the

49.31 percent said they believe that candidates with backgrounds in

      <P>Both inbound and outbound tourists have
declined significantly since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in the
United States, the Tourism Bureau reported Thursday.</P>
      <P>According to bureau tallies, the number of tourist arrivals
between July 12 and Sept. 30 fell 19.4 percent from the same period
of last year.</P>
      <P>In September alone, the total number of inbound passengers
dropped 12.8 percent from the year-earlier level. By areas, the
number of tourists from the United States registered a 26.9 percent
annual decrease in September; the number of Japanese tourists slid
9.4 percent; and the number of Hong Kong visitors also fell 8 percent
in September.</P>
      <P>The total tourist arrivals for the first nine months of this year
posted a moderate 5.8 percent gain as compared with the same period
of last year, tourist officials said.</P>
      <P>The Tourism Bureau originally projected this year's growth in
inbound tourists at 10 percent. But now the bureau said it has to
adjust downward the growth target to a marginal 0.15 percent.</P>
      <P>Although tourist arrivals did increase slightly more than
10 percent in the first half of this year, the trend reversed
itself since July. In the first 10 days of October, the number of
inbound visitors recorded a 17.5 percent decline from the like
period of 2000.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in New York and
Washington have also dampened local people's interest in making
overseas pleasure trips as outbound travelers plunged 18.34 percent

      <P>In the first nine months of this year, outbound passengers
dwindled 3.67 percent as compared with the like period of last year.
Tourist officials said the total number of outbound travelers would
registered a 5 percent negative growth this year.</P>

have seen their room occupancy rates drop by more than 20
percent, travel sources said.</P>
      <P>Tourist officials said they will step up promotional efforts to

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 18 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Trade and economic ties between Taiwan and
mainland China will become closer after both sides join the World
Trade Organization (WTO) and bilateral trade disputes can be settled
under the WTO framework, an economic affairs official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a seminar sponsored by the National Policy Foundation
on the impact of WTO membership, Vice Minister of Economic Affairs
Lin Yi-fu said mutual benefits will far exceed competition following
the two sides' entry into the world trade regulatory body.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, increased trade and economic exchanges will
bring the two sides closer, but mainland-based export-oriented small
Taiwan businesses will be hit hard.</P>
      <P>In terms of industries, Lin pointed out that Taiwan's
agricultural industry will be much more affected by its WTO
membership than the service and industrial sectors due to the
expected lowering of high import duties on agricultural imports. The
service and industrial sectors will be less affected in turn as a
result of their wider opening to foreign competition.</P>
      <P>Kao Koong-lian, former vice chairman of the Mainland Affairs
Council and now a panel director of the foundation, urged the
government to pay attention to future inflows of foreign imports and
investment from mainland China.</P>
      <P>Lin Chu-chia, a professor of economic science at National
Chengchi University, said current cross-strait activities are already
complementary in nature and that is the reason why two-way trade and
economic exchanges are increasingly growing.</P>
      <P>WTO membership will create an international stage and a good
communication channel for both Taiwan and mainland China, he said.
Lin called on the governments on both sides of the Strait to forswear
their ideological struggle and devote their energy to economic issues
of mutual concern.</P>

      <P>An online newspaper published by the
Presidential Office was formally launched Thursday, according to
officials of the Department of Public Affairs under the Presidential
Office.</P>
      <P>The officials said "President A-bian's Electronic Paper" seeks to
use an informal approach to explain the president's administrative
ideals and ways to implement them, as well as a more delicate
approach to depict the inner world of President Chen Shui-bian,
nicknamed A-bian.</P>
      <P>Officials said they hope the paper will build a channel of
"direct communication between the president and the people" so that
they can share the president's thoughts and some of the titbits of
his daily life.</P>
      <P>Officials said the inaugural publication includes a column on
Chen's recent observations in which the president lauds the Taiwan
people's "great ability to adapt to their environment" and says that
this spirit should be upheld to overcome difficulties and "create
miracles."</P>
      <P>The inaugural edition also includes video excerpts of the
president's appeal to the nation made on the Double Ten National Day
rally, in which he exhorted the people to stand up to challenges and
realize their dreams.</P>
      <P>There is also an "information zone" that reveals for the first
time that the president will publish a new book at the end of the
month. The book will describe how the president has faced problems,
met challenges and thought about the future since assuming the
presidency May 20, 2000.</P>
      <P>There is also a readers' hotline column in which the first
article is a letter to the president from a couple that have devoted
themselves to post-Sept. 21 earthquake reconstruction work, together
with the president's response.</P>
      <P>The paper also carries previously unpublished pictures of the
president.</P>
      <P>Officials said that since the paper began to accept subscriptions
Oct. 8., the response has been so enthusiastic that the number of
subscribers had surpassed 20,000 by Wednesday. The subscribers will
receive the paper via e-mail.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's arms procurement spending in 2000
fell to US$1.2 billion, while mainland China took deliveries worth
US$1.6 billion, according to a report released Thursday by the
International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS).</P>
      <P>The IISS "Military Balance 2001-2002" report notes that the value
of Taiwan's arms deliveries in 2000 reached its lowest point since
1995 even as the value of mainland China's arms deliveries shot up
from 1999's US$510 million.</P>
      <P>The London-based IISS pointed out that the international arms
trade fell significantly, with the total value of deliveries falling
from US$37.2 billion in 1999 to US$29.3 billion in 2000.</P>
      <P>The Middle East continued to spend more on arms imports than any
other region, accounting for at least 40 percent of the world market.
Saudi Arabia, the largest Middle Eastern customer, took deliveries
worth US$7.3 billion, a slight increase over 1999.</P>
      <P>The United States once again accounted for nearly 50 percent of
global arms deliveries, while the United Kingdom remained the
second-largest exporter, with 17.4 percent of deliveries, the IISS
report notes.</P>
      <P>The IISS predicts that delivery of eight diesel-electric
submarines that the U.S. administration has agreed to sell Taiwan
will be delayed even under the best of circumstances, because the
United States no longer produces diesel submarines and other
countries that can still manufacture the vessels have already
expressed their unwillingness to cooperate.</P>
      <P>The report also notes that Taiwan's impending acquisition of four
U.S. Kidd-class destroyers should serve as an effective
counter-balance to a number of destroyers that mainland China has
acquired from Russia.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's acquisition of more advanced Patriot missiles will also
improve its ability to counter short-range ballistic missiles and
cruise missiles, the IISS report adds.</P>

      <P>The fear of anthrax is increasing in
Taiwan, with people eager to obtain antibiotics against anthracis
bacillus, sources with the Center for Disease Control (CDC) under the
Department of Health said Thursday.</P>
      <P>CDC officials said the center has received 44 phone calls from
around the island in the past few days inquiring where they can buy
Ciprofloxacin -- the antibiotic used to treat anthrax -- and what
they can do if they receive mail containing an unknown white powder.</P>
      <P>Some of those making the phone calls said they have felt worried
after receiving mail with an unknown return address, with some even
suspecting that they had contracted anthrax.</P>
      <P>CDC Deputy Director Chiang Ying-lung noted that no human anthrax
cases have been reported in Taiwan since 1969 and added that
presently there are eight local hospitals that have Ciprofloxacin
supplies.</P>
      <P>He asked doctors to heighten their alert regarding the disease
and urged the public to see a doctor if they suspect that they have
contracted the disease.</P>
      <P>He said that because Ciprofloxacin has strong side effects, the
public should not buy the antibiotic over the counter.</P>
      <P>The CDC urged the public not to open mail of unknown origin but
to seal it in plastic bags and let the police and the CDC deal with
it.</P>
      <P>Chiang also advised anyone receiving mail containing an unknown
white powder to wash their hands and avoid touching their face,
because anthrax spores are easily killed with soap and water.</P>

of China and Paraguay when he received visiting National Asuncion
University President Paul Battilana.</P>
      <P>The president noted the close exchanges between the two
countries, saying Paraguay is the only ally of the ROC in South
America and an important gateway to the South American market.</P>
      <P>The president said that he attaches great importance to relations
between the two countries and that the ROC government looks forward
to a visit to Taiwan from Paraguayan President Luis Angel Gonzalez
Macchi in the first half of next year.</P>
      <P>The president, who received an honorary doctoral degree from the
National Asuncion University when he visited Paraguay in May this
year, said that he welcomes Battilana on his first visit to the ROC,
both as ROC president and an alumni.</P>
      <P>The president said that the bestowing of the honorary degree
on him was not just his personal honor but also a recognition of the
political and economic achievements realized by the ROC and the 23
million people of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The president said that he cherished his first honorary doctoral
degree from a Spanish-language country.</P>
      <P>The president noted that Asuncion University, created in 1887, is
a prestigious university with 12 colleges and 55 departments and
graduate schools. If it can forge sisterhood relations with Taiwan
universities and increase exchanges, this would further enhance the
understanding between the two peoples, he went on.</P>
      <P>Battilana for his part expressed the hope that the ROC Ministry
of Education will send more Chinese language teachers to Paraguay,
whereupon Chen promised to provide assistance so that Asuncion
University can establish a department and graduate school of Chinese
language soon.</P>
      <P>Battilana also said that it was a great honor of his university
to bestow the honorary doctorate on Chen and expressed the hope to
have more exchanges and cooperation between his university and its
Taiwan counterparts to help develop Paraguay's technology.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EX-VICE PRESIDENT REMAINS TAIPEI'S CHOICE OF APEC ENVOY: ROC OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Shanghai,  Oct.  18  (CNA)
(By Peng Szu-chou and Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China's economics
minister said Thursday that former Vice President Li Yuan-zu remains
Taipei's sole choice to represent the ROC president at the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum's informal leadership
meeting slated for Oct. 20-21.</P>
      <P>Lin Hsin-yi said at a news conference in Shanghai following an
APEC ministerial level meeting that he hopes Beijing will
"demonstrate its wisdom," because Taipei will insist on its choice
"to the last moment."</P>
      <P>Beijing has insisted that Taiwan must act in accordance with past
practice by sending officials with economic or financial backgrounds
to the regional meeting, but Taipei has been adamant in its wish to
send Li, justifying the decision by saying that his background as a
criminal law expert would be better suited to contributing to
discussions on anti-terrorism, which will be on the agenda at the
summit meeting.</P>
      <P>At another news conference held immediately after Thursday's
ministerial meeting, mainland Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan
insinuated that there might be "some kind of obscure political
scheme" behind Taipei's choice of Li.</P>
      <P>When Lin rose to his feet and raised his hand to request the
floor to hear Taipei's explanation, Tang cut him off, saying that it
was unnecessary to "waste further time" on explanations.</P>
      <P>Tang also referred to the Taipei delegation as "China Taipei"
instead of the APEC-designated "Chinese Taipei."</P>
      <P>Responding to Tang's accusation, Taipei's visiting Council for
Economic Planning and Development Chairman Chen Po-chih said that it
is "a kind of misunderstanding."</P>
      <P>Chen added that on the basis of promoting benign bilateral
interaction, Taipei hopes Beijing will not dwell on such
misunderstandings.</P>
      <P>With Beijing's acceptance of Li still up in the air, National
Chengchi University foreign relations professor Lin Bih-jaw said in
Taipei that out of consideration of the national interest, the ROC
government should not speak of boycotting the APEC summit in protest,
as some observers have conjectured it might.</P>
      <P>Lin suggested that if Beijing really cannot accept Li as envoy,
Taipei should try to find another candidate in the limited time
available and try not to absent itself from the summit.</P>
      <P>Both Taiwan and mainland China joined APEC in 1991, but Beijing
has used its political clout to block ROC presidents from attending
the group's annual summit meeting. As a result, ROC presidents have
traditionally had to designate a stand-in, usually an economics
official, to represent the president.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN STRONG ON INVENTION AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT: REPORT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  18 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's strong invention capability will
have the country enjoy the world's seventh most competitive economy
for the next five years, according to a report published Thursday by
the Geneva-based World Economic Forum (WEF).</P>
      <P>The forum reported in its Global Competitiveness Report 2001 that
Taiwan will have the world's seventh-most promising economic growth
prospects over the next five years due to its technical progress,
especially in the field of invention. Taiwan has the world's
fourth-highest number of patents and that is a sound foundation for
its economic development, the report said.</P>
      <P>According to the report, Taiwan leads 75 other countries in the
field of invention, lagging behind only Canada. However, according to
the results of a survey of 1,000 international businesses around the
world, Taiwan ranks only in a relatively low 18th place in the same
category.</P>
      <P>Statistics compiled by the Cabinet-level Directorate General of
Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) indicate that the number of
patents grew noticeably last year in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In 2000, a total of 61,000 new patents applied for government
registration, up 17.9 percent from the 1999 level. Some 42,241 of
them were approved by the government, up 44.9 percent from a year
ago. About 17,503 of the approved new patents were new inventions, up
55.2 percent over the year-earlier level.</P>
      <P>In terms of the number of new inventions approved by the U.S.
government, 5,806 cases raised by Taiwan were recognized by the U.S.
authorities, behind only patents from the United States, Japan and
Germany.</P>
      <P>In addition, a total of 9,203 articles of scientific research and
study were published in major local scientific publications, an
increase of 259 over 1999, according to the DGBAS tallies.</P>

      <P>Republic of China Minister of Foreign

attend the Oct. 20-21 informal leadership conference of the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian has appointed former Vice President Li
Yuan-zu as his representative at the Shanghai leadership conference,
but because of Beijing's opposition, Li has been unable to leave for
Shanghai.</P>
      <P>The foreign ministry held a meeting to discuss the issue Thursday

dignity.</P>
      <P>Tien said at a press conference that Beijing should commit the
obligations of a host country and send an invitation to Taipei as
soon as possible.</P>
      <P>He criticized Beijing for failing to follow the past
APEC practice of dispatching an official to deliver the invitation
in person, and expressed Taipei's serious protest over the
"unreasonable treatment" accorded Taipei by mainland China.</P>
      <P>Earlier that day, ROC Minister of Economic Affairs Lin Hsin-yi
said in Shanghai that Li "remains the sole choice of Taipei for the

suppression of the movement.</P>
      <P>Huang Chun-mei, a Falun Gong practitioner from Taiwan, said that

Falun Gong practitioners and help rescue practitioners persecuted in
mainland China.</P>
      <P>Fifteen EU heads of state were scheduled to meet Friday in nearby
Ghent, Belgium, for an unofficial summit.</P>

      <P>They also sent a letter to Beijing, urging the authorities there
to release Falun Gong practitioner Zhao Ming, presently incarcerated
in a labor camp in mainland China.</P>
      <P>According to the spokesman, European Parliament members Olivier
Durpuis and Lennart Sacredios, as well as Marcel Colla, chairman of

    <HEADLINE>CABINET VOICES SUPPORT FOR TAIWAN'S APEC MINISTERIAL DELEGATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 20 (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet announced Saturday that it has
extended the government's regards to Minister of Economic Affairs Lin
Hsin-yi for his delegation's hard work in the just-concluded
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum ministerial meetings.</P>
      <P>Lin's delegation, which includes Council for Economic Planning
and Development Chairman Chen Po-chih and other Republic of China
economic officials, was slated to return from Shanghai to Taipei
Saturday.</P>
      <P>On behalf of Premier Chang Chun-hsiung, Cabinet Secretary-General
Chiou I-jen had cabled Lin's delegation the previous day to express
the government's moral support, despite some outside criticism of the
delegation's performance in the face of Beijing's repeated attempts
to put down Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan was unable to participate in the ongoing APEC
informal leadership summit because of Beijing's refusal to accept a
former ROC vice president who had been selected to attend in place of
ROC President Chen Shui-bian, Lin's delegation managed to contribute
in various ways to the APEC mechanism before leaving Shanghai, an
official said.</P>
      <P>The official added that the delegation has lodged a letter of
protest to Beijing -- the host of this year's APEC summit -- while
copies were delivered to the other 19 APEC members.</P>
      <P>Lin has conveyed to the United States Taiwan's willingness to
cooperate with America's anti-terrorist operations despite being
barred from attending a breakfast meeting Thursday for APEC members
to discuss the subject.</P>
      <P>He has also suggested to his mainland Chinese counterpart that a
bilateral economic and trade advisory channel can be established
under the World Trade Organization (WTO) framework in order to
resolve bilateral economic and trade issues.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, his delegation has helped promote the process
of further liberalization of trade and investment in the Asia Pacific
region and has voiced support for starting a new round of
negotiations at the fourth ministerial meeting of the WTO.</P>
      <P>It has also shared Taiwan's successful experience in developing
small- and medium-sized businesses with other APEC members, including
Brunei, New Zealand, Singapore and Thailand.</P>
      <P>APEC comprises Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, mainland China,
South Korea, the United States, the Philippines, Hong Kong,
Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea,
Peru, Russia, Singapore, Thailand, Taiwan and Vietnam.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NO COMPROMISE ON CROSS-STRAIT TRADE POLICY: ROC PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 20 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Saturday that
no incidents will be allowed to compromise Taiwan's business and
trade policy toward mainland China, which was reshaped during the
Economic Development Advisory Conference (EDAC) held late August.</P>
      <P>Chen reassured the nation that all the conclusions reached at the
EDAC, including business and trade policy toward mainland China, will
be carried out one after another without interruption by any incident
across the Taiwan Strait, such as Taiwan's forced absence from the
Oct. 20-21 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) leadership summit
meeting in Shanghai.</P>
      <P>The president made the remarks during a speech to a gala marking
the 45th founding anniversary of TECO Electric and Machinery Co. in
Taipei.</P>
      <P>Chen said the government is currently preparing for Taiwan's
accession into the World Trade Organization (WTO) in the hope that
accession will help bolster the country's strength while expanding
its arena of international activities.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chen stressed, the administration will also strive to
carry out the EDAC conclusions and implement a new list of economic
development guidelines to accelerate the upgrading of Taiwan's
industrial structure, improve the investment climate and sharpen the
domestic business and industrial sector's international
competitiveness.</P>
      <P>Chen also gave a thumbs-up to TECO's performance during its
long-term presence in Taiwan's electrical and machinery manufacturing
development.</P>
      <P>With its persistence and entrepreneurship, TECO has become a
household name in Taiwan over the past several decades, Chen said,
adding that because the electrical motors produced by TECO are so
commendable, the word "TECO" is now tantamount in Taiwan to "motor."</P>
      <P>Chen also exhorted TECO's management and workforce to "plow
deeper in Taiwan while seeding globally" and turn the company into
Taiwan's "motor" of economic progress.</P>

    <HEADLINE>APEC BOYCOTT `INEVITABLE:' DPP CHAIR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  20  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Given mainland China's recalcitrant and
bullying mentality, Taiwan's absence from this year's informal
leadership meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)
forum was "inevitable," a ruling party heavyweight said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairman Frank Hsieh was
commenting on the Republic of China government's announcement Friday
that in protest over Beijing's refusal to send an official invitation
to Taiwan, the country would not be represented in the Oct. 20-21
APEC summit meeting in Shanghai.</P>
      <P>"It was a forced choice to protect our national dignity," Hsieh
said, adding he is convinced that no matter which domestic political
party was in power, its administration would certainly make a similar
choice.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said that although it is important for Taiwan to join in
international activities, national dignity and sovereignty should not
be disparaged.</P>
      <P>In the first place, Hsieh said, Beijing broke the established
APEC protocol of sending a special envoy to Taipei to deliver a
formal invitation to President Chen Shui-bian to the Shanghai summit
meeting. Instead, it simply faxed an unsigned notice without
specifying the name of the recipient.</P>
      <P>Even after Chen designated former Vice President Li Yuan-zu to
attend the annual APEC summit in his stead, Beijing still declined to
issue an official invitation.</P>
      <P>"Against this backdrop, could we send a delegation to the
Shanghai meeting at the expense of our national dignity?" Hsieh
asked.</P>
      <P>He reminded mainland Chinese leaders that if they opt to
"completely swallow" Taiwan, such a strategy will lead nowhere.</P>
      <P>Hsieh, who concurrently serves as mayor of Kaohsiung, Taiwan's
second-largest city after Taipei, further urged the mainland leaders
to forsake their "zero-sum" game strategy and treat Taiwan with
respect so as to create a win-win scenario for both sides.</P>
      <P>Hsieh also warned that Beijing's sabotage of Taiwan's
participation in the 2001 APEC summit will only increase the feelings
of resentment and result in a negative impact on cross-strait
relations.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Hsieh called on the people of Taiwan to stand united
behind the government in support of its decision to safeguard
national dignity.</P>

(By David Wang, Eric C.Y. Tseng and Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's visiting Dharma Master Hsing Yun
claimed Friday that the United States is waging a "merciful war"
targeting terrorists, not Muslims, because the war is being carried
out even as relief supplies are being airdropped over Afghanistan.</P>
      <P>Hsing Yun, who heads the renowned Fokuangshan monastery in
Taiwan, made the remarks at a news conference before leading 30 of
his followers in a blessing and cleansing ritual at the site of the
former World Trade Center.</P>
      <P>At the conference, he expressed his opinion that the U.S.-led war
is "not a war of hatred." The United States, he said, is using
"mercy" and "wisdom" to subjugate the enemy.</P>
      <P>He also said that while he does not agree with war, the current
conflict is a "necessary" conflict "for peace."</P>
      <P>Hsing Yun also urged the American public not to panic in the face
of reported cases of anthrax attacks, adding that he is confident in
the survival of mankind.</P>
      <P>On another occasion in midtown Manhattan later in the evening,
Hsing Yun urged the various religions, economies and nations of the
world to respect and accept each other and to seek out other ways of
resolving differences other than through war.</P>
      <P>He said that wealth cannot be measured merely in material or
monetary terms. Security, health and wisdom are other kinds of
wealth, he added.</P>
      <P>During his visit, Hsing Yun donated US$200,000 to the American
Red Cross on behalf of Fokuangshan for distribution to the families
of the victims in the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on America.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER REAFFIRMS `NO CHANGE' IN CROSS-STRAIT TRADE POLICY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  20  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung said Saturday
that although Taiwan is dismayed by Beijing's rudeness in barring its
envoy at the current Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit,
it will not change its cross-Taiwan Strait trade policy.</P>
      <P>Chang made the remarks while attending a ceremony to mark the
45th founding anniversary of TECO Electric and Machinery Co., one of
Taiwan's largest electric appliances and electronics manufacturing
groups.</P>
      <P>Chang said he feels regret over mainland China's failure to abide
by the APEC protocol of sending a special envoy to deliver an
official invitation to President Chen Shui-bian to the regional
economic forum's Oct. 20-21 informal leadership meeting in Shanghai.</P>
      <P>In order to safeguard the Republic of China's national dignity
and status, Chang said the ROC government was forced to call off its
plan to send a delegation to the meeting in protest over Beijing's
discrimination.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Chang said the incident will not dampen the
government's preparations for easing restrictions on mainland
China-bound investment, expanding the functions of the offshore
cross-strait transshipping center or the opening of direct
cross-strait trade, mail and transportation links.</P>
      <P>Noting that "active opening, effective management" is the
government's basic policy toward commercial and civilian exchanges
across the Taiwan Strait, Chang said the government will not back off
from this stance simply because of any single incident.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, TECO Chairman Huang Mao-hsiung
said mainland China's suppression of Taiwan's participation in APEC
activities is very regrettable.</P>
      <P>"Perhaps cross-strait economic exchanges will be affected by the
latest APEC disputes. In the long run, I think cross-strait trade
ties will continue to move ahead and will not suffer any serious
setback," Huang said optimistically, adding that he hopes the two
sides will continue to strengthen dialogue and communication.</P>
      <P>In his view, Huang said, cross-strait political disputes should
not overly hinder bilateral commercial exchanges for the sake of
mutual benefits. Like many other Taiwan companies, he went on, TECO
has set up production facilities on the mainland.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 20 (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Bone fractures are more prevalent in Taiwan
than anywhere else in Asia because of local people's aversion to
exercise and the sun, according to the president of the Republic of
China Osteoporosis Association.</P>
      <P>Yang Tsai-hsing said Saturday at a seminar on osteoporosis on
World Osteoporosis Day that according to a study conducted by
National Taiwan University, as many as one out of every 200 people in
Taiwan has had a bone fracture.</P>
      <P>Most of the victims are senior citizens, with only a small
percentage being younger people who sustain fractures through
accidents, he said, adding that the death rate among senior citizens
a year after bone fracture is as high as 15 percent.</P>
      <P>Yang said that drinking milk and taking calcium supplements can
be helpful in making bones stronger for young people, and that people
older than 35 or women after menopause should also take an
appropriate amount of calcium supplement if they are unable to
achieve a balanced diet.</P>
      <P>However, he continued, bone tissue that is lost in old age cannot
be replaced through calcium pills or milk. Only prescription drugs
can truly control the loss of bone tissue, he added.</P>
      <P>Osteoporosis, a hormonal condition also known as brittle bone
disease, is most common among post-menopausal women.</P>

    <DATELINE>Chiayi,   Oct.   20  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>After five months of waiting and
struggling, a local transsexual woman was allowed Friday by the
Chiayi District Court to become an adoptive parent to a six-month-old
baby boy, marking a precedent in Taiwan legal history.</P>
      <P>Gorgeous Chang Chia-ling, also known as "Chung Ling," was allowed
to adopt the baby, whose parents have been unable to look after him
since birth, on the grounds that she has sufficient family support to
raise the child, according to sources from the Chiayi District Court.</P>
      <P>Chang filed a request with the Chiayi District Court in May to
adopt the baby, but the court did not respond favorably for the first
several months, as court officials doubted her ability to take care
of a child as she is a "show girl" with what the officials thought is
an "odd" sexual history.</P>
      <P>Chang makes her living as a drag show actress in southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>At an Aug. 24 hearing, the judges said they would make a final
decision only after Chang could provide more background information
on her adoption agreement.</P>
      <P>After reviewing all relevant papers and carrying out fact-finding
visits to the child's biological mother's home, as well as to Chang's
home, the judges gave the green light Friday to Chang's adoption
petition.</P>
      <P>In addition, the judges said, there is no mention in the Republic
of China's Civil Codes whether or not a transsexual can become an
adoptive parent.</P>
      <P>The child's birth mother is currently serving a jail sentence for
drug abuse, while the father has been declared "unknown." The child
had been looked after by his grandfather since the mother went to
prison.</P>
      <P>Chang is the neighbor of the child's grandfather and she
developed a special fondness for the child as soon as she saw him.
She then asked to take care of the child and the child's grandfather
happily agreed.</P>
      <P>Chang was thrilled by the judges final approval for the adoption.</P>
      <P>"Now I'm the baby's mother and I am going to name him Chang
Tah-wen," she said shortly after hearing of the court's decision.</P>
      <P>She noted that ever since she was a child, she believed herself
to be a female in a male's body and had always liked to wear his
mother's dresses and play with dolls.</P>
      <P>At the age of 24 after completing military conscription, Chang
went to Thailand to receive a sex change operation at a cost of
NT$240,000.</P>
      <P>Since than, she has lived happily, gaining local fame in the drag
show business and a better-than-average living.</P>
      <P>"A child like this will make my life fuller and more complete,"
she noted.</P>

      <P>Taiwanese officials in Canada kicked off a
letter-to-the-editors campaign Friday after host China violated APEC
protocol by neglecting to send an envoy to deliver Taiwan's
invitation to the forum's informal leaders' meeting.</P>
      <P>"In calculating to obstruct Taiwan's participation in the
meeting, the People's Republic of China has shown its true face to
the world and has neglected its responsibility as APEC's host
country," said a letter from the Taiwan representative office in
Canada to the Ottawa Citizen newspaper.</P>
      <P>The letter was signed by Kuan Ching-cheng, director of the
Information Division of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office,
Canada. It also accused Beijing of rejecting a Taiwanese presidential
representative nominated to attend the APEC meeting in Shanghai.</P>
      <P>"The PRC acts have made it impossible for Taiwan to attend the

of APEC, has every right to participate and be accorded the same
respect and dignity as any other contributing nation.</P>

for Taiwan's efforts and concerns for peace and security in the Asia

      <P>Taiwan will not be discouraged from its role in APEC, he said,
adding that Taiwan will support any measures adopted at the meeting,
in the knowledge that only cooperation will see the end to terrorism

    <HEADLINE>U.S. LAMENTS TAIWAN'S ABSENCE FROM APEC LEADER'S SUMMIT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Oct.  19  (CNA)
(By Jay Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Praising Taiwan for the role it has
played in the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, the
United States said Friday that Taiwan's absence from the group's
leaders' meeting this year "will be a loss for all participants."</P>
      <P>The State Department expressed disappointment that Taiwan was
unable to attend the leaders' meeting, which opens Saturday in
Shanghai, but said that Washington does not see this "as a precedent
for future APEC meetings."</P>
      <P>It also said that the United States "expects Taiwan will attend
next year's leaders' meeting," which will be held in Mexico.</P>
      <P>The statement came after Beijing failed to respond to Taiwan's
proposal to send former Vice President Li Yuan-zu as its
representative to the informal gathering of heads of state or
government.</P>
      <P>Since the first leaders' meeting was held in 1993, Taiwan has
been the only member of the now 21-member organization not
represented by its political leader, thanks to objections from
Beijing.</P>
      <P>In the statement read to reporters, the State Department also
expressed Washington's gratitude for the way ROC President Chen
Shui-bian has handled the incident and for his support of the
U.S.-led campaign against terrorism.</P>
      <P>"We appreciate President Chen's statement of support of the
global counter-terrorism program and his affirmation of Taiwan's
willingness to implement the decisions that APEC leaders will reach
October 21," said the State Department.</P>
      <P>It said that the United States has supported Taiwan's "membership
and valued participation in APEC" since the island joined the
organization in 1992.</P>
      <P>Without commenting specifically on Taiwan's choice or its
rejection by Beijing, the State Department said that the United
States has "supported, as in the past, Taiwan's participation in APEC
meetings at appropriately senior levels."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Private cars can pick up or unload
airline passengers at Los Angeles International Airport terminals as
from Saturday, the Airport Authority said Friday.
 "Starting 5 a.m. tomorrow," an Airport Authority spokesman
said, "private cars will be allowed to stop near terminal
entrances to pick up or unload passengers."</P>
      <P>The multifloor car parks near the terminals are also open to
private cars, the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>The Airport Authority has banned all private cars from driving 
near the terminal entrances since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on
the World Trade Center in New York and the Pentagon to prevent car
bomb assaults. Two temporary parking lots set up miles away from the
airport terminals have accommodated private cars, whose riders are
ferried to and back from the terminals through free shuttle bus
service.</P>
      <P>Car drivers are not allowed to park on the shoulders of the
driveway to load or unload baggage, the spokesman said. Nor can
they pick up or unload passengers there.</P>
      <P>Police will continue spot-checking vehicles in and out of
the airport to prevent terrorist sabotage, the sokesman said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIPEI NOT TO BACKPEDAL ON PLANNED CROSS-STRAIT TRADE OPENING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  20  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Economic Affairs Lin Hsin-yi
said Saturday that Taiwan will not backpedal on its planned trade
liberalization with mainland China despite what happened at Shanghai.</P>
      <P>Lin told a news conference in Taipei after his return from
Shanghai that Taiwan would continue liberalizing trade with
mainland China "according to schedule." He attended this year's
ministerial meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)
forum as Taiwan's chief delegate.</P>
      <P>Taipei's decision to boycott the informal APEC leadership meeting
will not curtail its plan to ease restrictions under the existing "no
haste, be patient" policy on investment in mainland China, Lin said.</P>
      <P>Noting that the decision to ease such investment restrictions was
one of the conclusions reached at the high-profile Economic
Development Advisory Conference (ADEC) in late August, Lin said the
demarche is on course in spite of Taiwan's boycott of the Oct. 20-21
APEC summit in protest against Beijing's breach of the forum's
well-established protocol.</P>
      <P>"We must conduct cross-strait relations with vision and should
not be daunted by any setback in carrying out our basic economic
development policy of 'developing Taiwan with global perspective,'"
Lin said.</P>
      <P>Lin arrived in Shanghai Oct. 15 at the head of the Republic of
China delegation to the Oct. 17-18 APEC ministerial meeting.</P>
      <P>During a news conference Thursday, mainland Chinese Foreign
Minister Tang Jiaxuan rudely brushed aside Lin's complaint that
Chinese Taipei, the ROC's official designation in APEC, had not
received the formal invitation from the host country to attend the
leadership meeting in Shanghai.</P>
      <P>Tang's rudeness, Lin said, "manifestly exposed the true nature of
Beijing's policy" toward Taiwan.</P>
      <P>As Taipei and Beijing were still negotiating Taiwan's
"representation" issue, Lin said, he had to refrain from making any
"strong" protest lest it should abort the negotiations. He did not
file any verbal protest with Tang at the press meeting.</P>
      <P>"We were determined not to give up hopes until the last minute
as we believed that former Vice President Li Yuan-zu was the
best stand-in to represent President Chen Shui-bian at the APEC
summit," Lin pointed out.</P>
      <P>Taipei announced its decision not to attend the Shanghai summit
Friday morning. "As soon as we had learned of the decision," Lin
said, "we lodged a strong protest with the mainland Chinese
authorities over their failure to observe the APEC convention to
extend Li an official invitation. We have also circulated our letter
of protest among the 19 other APEC members."</P>
      <P>Later on Friday, Lin said, he followed his prearranged schedule
to visit Taiwan companies in Suzhou and Kushan, both near Shanghai.
Taiwan investors there, he added, are generally well aware of
cultural and political differences between the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The cross-strait wrangling over Taiwan's representation at the
APEC summit did not hamper the Taipei delegation's dialogue with all
other APEC member states to improve bilatera and multilateral trade
and economic cooperation, Lin added.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Lin said, he has received assurances of their support
for Taiwan's early accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO), a
Geneva-based world trade regulatory body.</P>
      <P>"A joint statement issued at the end of the ministerial meeting
also reaffirmed the forum's full support for Taiwan's and
mainland China's WTO accession," Lin said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>APEC LEADERS URGED TO JOINTLY CONDEMN BEIJING'S RUDENESS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Shanghai,   Oct.  20  (CNA)
(By Peng Si-chou and Bear Lee)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China President Chen
Shui-bian Saturday urged the member economies of the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum to jointly condemn China's
discrimination against Taiwan at the ongoing APEC meeting.</P>
      <P>In a letter to the other APEC leaders, Chen expressed his
"profound disappointment and great rage of not being invited by the
People's Republic of China, the host economy, to attend this very
important meeting."</P>
      <P>Citing a 1991 APEC memorandum of understanding on Taiwan's
accession to the organization and past practices, China had rejected
Taiwan's proposal to have it represented by Li Yuan-zu, former vice
president, at the informal leadership meeting of the 21-member trade
bloc on the grounds that Li has no economic background. The summit
began in Shanghai on Saturday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan announced its withdrawal from the summit on Friday and put
its blame on China for its "irrational" obstruction of Taiwan's
participation in the gathering and other international events.</P>
      <P>Taiwan, which joined APEC in 1992, had since 1993 sent top
economic affairs officials, in stead of its president, to attend the
annual gathering of heads of state or government of APEC members.</P>
      <P>Chen said that as a member of APEC, Taiwan has in the past 10
years fully supported and taken part in the APEC-sponsored programs,
including the liberalization of trade and investment as well as
economic and technical cooperation.</P>
      <P>He added that Taiwan had been looking forward to cooperating
closely with all other members at the Shanghai meeting to fight
terrorism and work out ways for a speedy recovery of the sluggish
global economy.</P>
      <P>However, Chen said, Taiwan was unable to attend this year's
gathering due to China's violation of the APEC practices by not
sending an envoy to Taipei to deliver the invitation to the meeting.</P>
      <P>"China's intentional discrimination against Taiwan's
participation in APEC has severely hurt APEC's spirit of
cooperation," Chen said in the letter circulated by Taipei's
delegates before they departed for home.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Economic Affairs Minister Lin Hsin-yi and Council of
Economic Planning and Development Chairman Chen Po-chih, who attended
the pre-summit ministerial meeting, returned to Taipei earlier in the
day, leaving Taiwan unrepresented at the summit for the first time.</P>
      <P>"I therefore call on the member economies to jointly condemn
China's behavior and prevent such an occurrence from happening
again," Chen said.</P>
      <P>In spite of its absence in the summit this year, Chen said,
Taiwan is more than willing to throw its full support behind the
U.S.-led anti-terrorism campaign and, within the APEC framework,
increase cooperation with all other members in the prevention of
money laundry and tax evasion.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DEC. 1 ELECTIONS CRITICAL TO POLITICAL REFORM: PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  Taiwan,  Oct.  20 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said
Saturday that the upcoming parliamentary elections are the most
critical part of Taiwan's political reform.</P>
      <P>The elections are scheduled for December 1. Top administrative
officials of Taiwan's 21 counties and cities will be elected
on the same day.</P>
      <P>Chen spoke on what he called the second phase political
reform in Taiwan at a national congress of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) here. "The elections," he pointed out, "are
vitally important to our ongoing political reform."</P>
      <P>Lee Teng-hui completed Taiwan's first phase political reform by
getting himself popularly elected president. The political
reform is now in its second stage following Chen's election
as president on March 18 last year.</P>
      <P>Since his inauguration on May 20, Chen said he has spared no
efforts to minimize the "transitional syndrome" or the
impact of the end of the Kuomintang's 55-year one-party rule.</P>
      <P>"Thanks to our concerted efforts, there has been no upheaval or
panic in society over the past one and half years," Chen said.</P>
      <P>As the DPP controls barely one-third of the seats of the
Legislative Yuan, Chen said, his administration has met boycott
after boycott in the opposition-dominated legislature nearly
every time it presented bills on reform or policy initiatives.</P>
      <P>As a result, Chen said, his administration has so far failed to
live up to Taiwan's "public expectations."</P>
      <P>To facilitate the administration's sweeping reform programs,
Chen said, he hopes that the DPP can emerge as the largest party in
the new legislature.</P>
      <P>"If the DPP wins the largest number of legislative seats, it will be
able to form a majority ruling alliance and a stable coalition government
to carry out various reform programs and rev up our sluggish economy," Chen
pointed out.</P>
      <P>The DPP success or failure in the year-end legislative elections
is crucial to Taiwan's continuing political reform, Chen said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP DISCARDS 'NO HASTE, BE PATIENT' POLICY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  20  (CNA)
(By Bear Lee)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) said Saturday that the "no haste, be patient" policy on
investment in the mainland is outdated and vowed to replace it with a
more aggressive approach.</P>
      <P>In a resolution passed at its national congress held in the
southern Taiwan city of Kaohsiung, the DPP vowed to adopt an "active
opening and efficient management" strategy with regard to Taiwan's
economic development in the face of the new century.</P>
      <P>The "no haste, be patient" policy, adopted by the previous
Kuomintang-led administration, bans any single Taiwan investment case
worth more than NT$50 million (about US$1.44 million) on the
mainland.</P>
      <P>The party said in the resolution that now is a turning point for
Taiwan to readjust its economic structure since a new world
economic order is in the making.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan must accelerate its economic reforms in the face of the
formation of new economic blocs and its imminent entry to the World
Trade Organization (WTO)," it said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan, which applied to join the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade (GATT), the predecessor of the WTO, in 1991, is expected to
become a full WTO member at the beginning of next year.</P>
      <P>The resolution puts its emphases on knowledge-based economy,
economic liberation, principle of social justice and improved
government efficiency.</P>
      <P>With the principle of "Taiwan first" and national security
ensured, the DPP said it hopes that the new approach will give a shot
in the arm of Taiwan, enabling it to create another economic miracle.</P>
      <P>Delegates to the congress also resolved to upgrade the status of
any resolution approved by party congress to "an equivalent of policy
guidelines."</P>
      <P>DPP Chairman Frank Hsieh, while responding to questions raised by
the press after the congress, denied that the move to heighten the
status of resolutions is a veil attempt to allow the "Resolution on
the Future of Taiwan" adopted in May, 1999 to take precedence of its
"Policy Guideline on the Independence of Taiwan" of 1991 which has
since caused controversy among the general public.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said that 1999 resolution aims to give a new interpretation
to the 1991 guidelines and that the DPP's stance on safeguarding the
sovereignty of Taiwan will not change.</P>
      <P>On which one of the two important documents DPP members should
follow, Hsieh, a lawyer-turned politician, said that "it's natural
for the new law (the 1999 resolution) to overtake the old one (the
1991 policy guidelines)."</P>
      <P>The 1991 Policy Guidelines on the Independence of Taiwan declares
clearly that the DPP aims to establish a Taiwan republic with an
independent sovereignty, while the 1999 "Resolution on the Future of
Taiwan" advocates that Taiwan is an independent state and that any
change in its status quo should be made possible only by means of a
referendum of all the people of the island.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BUSH IS FIRM ON COMMITMENT TO TAIWAN: US SPECIALIST</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>San  Francisco,  Oct.  20 (CNA)
(By Neil Lu and Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Although U.S. President George W.
Bush didn't dwell on the issue of Taiwan in his talks with Chinese
leader Jiang Zemin Thursday in Shanghai, he and his administration
is firm on the U.S. commitment to Taiwan's security, according to a
U.S specialist on Chinese affairs.</P>
      <P>Douglas Paal, president of the Asia Pacific Policy Center in
Washington D.C., told a local television station that Bush didn't
discuss the issue of Taiwan at length with Jiang because the Shanghai
summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum is not
the appropriate place or time to discuss the matter, but Bush's
concern for Taiwan's security is strong none the less.</P>
      <P>Paal, who is reported to be a candidate considered by President
Bush to head the Taipei office of the American Institute in Taiwan,
said that Bush has tried to coerce Beijing to mend its way by getting
tough with it since he took office eight months ago, and the policy
has thus far worked.</P>
      <P>Taiwan was afraid that the United States might back away from its
commitment to Taiwan's security during discussions with the Chinese
leadership while the United States tried to drum up support for its
anti-terrorist campaign.</P>
      <P>Bush said earlier this year that his administration will "do
whatever it takes" to defend Taiwan against possible attacks from
Beijing.</P>
      <P>In a joint news conference after their talks in Shanghai, Bush
said his government wanted to develop constructive ties with Beijing,
while Jiang urged Washington to abide by the three communiques
between the two sides in shaping its policy toward Beijing, and
handle its tie with Taiwan appropriately.</P>
      <P>Paal said mainland China has operated many intelligence gathering
stations along its border with Afghan and may possess information
valuable to Washington's campaign against terrorism in Afghanistan.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian will bring the
country to a new level during his four-year term, so long as the
people rally behind the government, Yu Shyi-kun, secretary-general of
the Presidential Office, said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Yu made the remarks while attending the inauguration of the
campaign headquarters of Perng Shaw-jin of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) for Taoyuan magistrate in the year-end
election.</P>
      <P>Yu said that after President Chen assumed the presidency in May
2000, he has actively promoted improving the conscience of politics
and was instrumental in withdrawing political influence from the
military, made headway against "black gold," and introduced financial
reforms -- all of which will strengthen the political and economic
fundamentals of the nation.</P>
      <P>He, who served as Ilan county magistrate for two terms, also
cited his own experience in Ilan County as an example, saying that
the eastern county, under the helm of the DPP for the past two
decades, has won recognition from all sides, adding that it is too
soon to see the full fruits of Chen's work as the president has only
been in office 17 months.</P>
      <P>Saying the government can accept criticism from the opposition
with humility, Yu also pointed out that the world economic slowdown
is a factor that must be considered when judging the performance of
the president.</P>
      <P>In addition, the president also inherited some of the
deficiencies from the previous administration, such as overdue loans
of more than NT$900 billion from financial institutions, and the fact
that the legislature has not undergone the same reshuffle as the
political changeover of the new government, he said, so that the new
government has faced an uphill battle in implementing many of his
policies.</P>
      <P>Yu also recommended Perng, saying that with his background as a
prosecutor and legislator, he has the vision, ideals as well as rich
experience, which he said would contribute to the building of Taoyuan
County.</P>

      <P>If the government wants to stimulate the
sluggish economy, it should not exclude mainland markets from its
global perspective, officials from the opposition New Party said
Sunday.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lai Shyi-bao, Taipei City Councilman Fei Hung-tai and
Pacific Broadband CEO Joanna Lei made the remarks at a seminar to
discuss Taiwan's investment environment in the wake of the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks in the United States.</P>
      <P>Lai noted that Taiwan's annual increase of industrial production
was negative 7.1 percent in the first eight months this year; annual
increase in the manufacturing industry was a negative 7.9 percent
during the period, showing Taiwan's domestic industry is in bad
shape. In addition, both private investment and export orders showed
negative growth.</P>
      <P>Lai suggested that the government vigorously implement the
consensus reached in the Economic Development Advisory Conference in
August, saying that among the 322 agreements reached during the
conference, the government has put less than 10 percent of them into
place.</P>
      <P>In addition, Lai said Taiwan and the mainland should complement
each other and establish a mechanism of division of labor. Taiwan
should not exclude mainland China markets from its global
perspective, Lai said.</P>
      <P>Lei, who will represent the New Party in the year-end legislative
election, said the government should not stop businesses from going
to the mainland, but should bail out infrastructure and industries
that employ a large number of workers. It should also keep the root
of such industries as personal computer industry in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Taipei City Councilman Fei noted that President Chen Shui-bian
had said that only with a stable cross-strait relationship and a
solid political and economic situation could it is possible to engage
in domestic reforms and develop the economy, adding that the
president should maintain good cross-strait relations and not
continue to strain the relationship.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT CHIEF CRITICIZES DPP FOR DEMEANING VOTERS BY SMEARING KMT</HEADLINE>

(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan
criticized the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Sunday for
looking down on voters by mimicking Chinese Communist tricks in
smearing the opposition parties.</P>
      <P>While stumping for party candidates in Chiayi City, KMT Lien said
the DPP is belittling the public if it thinks that lambasting the
opposition with communist jargon will win over the public in the
year-end elections.</P>
      <P>Lien was referring to DPP Chairman Frank Hsieh's criticism of the
KMT the previous day when he said that the opposition is the
country's "anti-reaction forces and public enemy," a term commonly
used by the Chinese Communists in the Cultural Revolution between
1966 and 1969.</P>
      <P>Noting that the DPP's attempts to use the communists' gambit in
Taiwan's elections is doomed to fail, Lien said, the ruling party has
betrayed its contempt for the voters by thinking naively that they
will buy its claims.</P>
      <P>Given the DPP's twisted perception of democracy, the KMT chief
said, if the DPP controls the legislature, it will be a disaster for
the country.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's absence from the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation (APEC) leadership meeting has set no
precedent for its future participation, Vice Foreign Minister Wu
Tzu-dan said Sunday.</P>
      <P>In an interview with the United Evening News, Wu said Taiwan
will continue to take part in next year's APEC summit in Mexico
City.</P>
      <P>"What transpired (in Shanghai) this time," Wu pointed out,
"should not be considered a precedent for the future APEC meetings."</P>
      <P>Taipei withdrew from this year's APEC summit at Shanghai
Friday over a dispute about who should represent Taiwan. Beijing
vetoed Former Vice President Li Yuan-zu, President Chen Shui-bian's
proxy at the meeting, which closed Sunday.</P>
      <P>In choosing Chen's personal representative to the Mexico City
summit, Wu said, Taipei will "take into account the international
situation and our ties with mainland China."</P>
      <P>Wu welcomed a statement from Washington on Saturday that Taiwan's
absence from the meeting is a loss to all participants. The U.S.
Department of State also said in the statement that the absence
should not be a precedent for the future APEC meetings.</P>
      <P>"We fully shared Washington's views," Wu said. "And we will
consider our choice for the next summit carefully," he added.</P>
      <P>The informal leadership meeting, initiated by U.S.President Bill
Clinton in 1993, was designed as a forum for leaders of the APEC
member economies, but Taiwan's chief of state has been excluded
from the gathering because of Beijing's opposition. Taipei used to
send an senior economic official to the meeting in place of its
president.</P>
      <P>Li, an erstwhile political heavyweight, was appointed President
Chen's representative at Shanghai. Beijing,however, extended no
formal invitation to Li.</P>
      <P>His absence left Taiwan unrepresented at the APEC summit
meeting for the first time since 1993.</P>

    <HEADLINE>APEC LEADERS VOW TO PREVENT 'ALL FORMS OF TERRORIST ACTS'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Shanghai, Oct. 21 (CNA)
(By Herman Pan &amp; Ed Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Asia-Pacific leaders Sunday pledged
to prevent "all forms of terrorist acts" and to strengthen
cooperation to catch those who carry out such crimes in a
joint statement after ending a two-day informal leadership summit
here.</P>
      <P>They unequivocally condemned "in the strongest terms" the
terrorist attacks in the United States on Sept. 11 and are
determined to enhance counter-terrorism cooperation in line with
"specific circumstances in their respective economies."</P>
      <P>In the anti-terrorism statement, the leaders at the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit pointed out
they consider the murderous deeds as well as other terrorist acts in
all forms and manifestations, committed wherever, whenever and by
whomsoever as a "profound threat to the peace, prosperity, and
security of all people, of all faiths, of all nations."</P>
      <P>"Leaders commit to prevent and suppress all forms of terrorist
acts in the future in accordance with the Charter of the United
Nations and other international law, pledge to implement the U.N.
Security Council Resolutions 1368 and 1373 faithfully and
immediately, strongly support all efforts to strengthen the
international anti-terrorism regime, call for increased cooperation
to bring perpetrators to justice, and also call for early signing and
ratification of all basic universal anti-terrorist
conventions, including the International Convention for the
Suppression for the Financing of Terrorism," the statement said.</P>
      <P>Terrorism is also a direct challenge to APEC's vision of free,
open and prosperous economies, and to the fundamental values that its
members hold, the statement said.</P>
      <P>The APEC leaders, the statement continued, " reaffirm that it is
more important than ever for every economy to forge ahead in its
commitment in achieving Bogor's goal of free, open trade and
investment."</P>
      <P>It is deemed imperative to strengthen international
cooperation at all levels in combating terrorism in a comprehensive
manner and affirm that the United Nations should play a major role
in this regard, the statement added.</P>
      <P>The leaders also pledged to fully cooperate to ensure that
international terrorism does not disrupt economies and markets,
through close communication and cooperation among economic policy and
financial authorities.</P>
      <P>The APEC groups Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, mainland
China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand,

    <HEADLINE>DPP SOFTENS STANCE ON TAIWAN'S INDEPENDENCE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,   Oct.   21  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) no longer insists on the hasty founding of an independent
republic of Taiwan, its chairman Frank Hsieh said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said the DPP virtually gave up its 1991 platform,
which calls for the establishment of a republic of Taiwan and
enforce a new constitution.</P>
      <P>He sponsored a motion, which was adopted at a DPP national
congress in this southern port city Saturday, to let the 1999
"Resolution on Taiwan's Future" take precedence over the party
platform. The resolution stipulates that any change in Taiwan's
status-quo must be determined by the 23 million people on this island
through a referendum.</P>
      <P>"As a new law supersedes an old one," Hsieh said, "the
Resolution on Taiwan's Future (instead of the party platform) now
serves as the basis for the DPP's fundamental policy vis-a-vis
cross-Taiwan Strait issues."</P>
      <P>With the change in policy, the DPP stops short of openly calling
for Taiwan's independence, for the resolution affirms that the island
as it is now is a de facto independent state.</P>
      <P>"The change," Hsieh pointed out, "reflects Taiwan's public opinion
and is in line with political realities. We are more flexible."</P>
      <P>Tsai Huang-lang, DPP whip at the Legislative Yuan, went
along with Hsieh halfway. He said that the ruling party was "pragmatic"
in upgrading the resolution.</P>
      <P>The party stalwart, however, insisted that the DPP has not
deviated from its Taiwan independence course. "There is no such
problem as to whether the DPP was attempting to play down its
independence platform," he said.</P>
      <P>"We have just adopted a pragmatic, or more flexible attitude on
the issue," Tsai added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN EXPORTS PLUMMET IN WAKE OF TYPHOONS, TERRORIST ATTACKS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  22  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The total value of Taiwan's September
export orders received plummeted by an unprecedented scale as a
result of a spate of typhoons and the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in
the United States, the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) reported
Monday.</P>
      <P>Export orders received by Taiwan exporters and manufacturers in
September totaled US$10.48 billion, down 26.81 percent from the level
for the previous September, marking the largest year-on-year monthly
drop in this category and the first time in Taiwan's foreign trade
history that such a decline exceeded 20 percent, MOEA officials said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the annual growth of Taiwan's industrial production
index showed a decline of 7.85 percent in the January-September
period, also marking the largest drop ever in any nine-month period
in this category, the officials noted.</P>
      <P>Electronics and related high-technology industries were the
hardest hit by the prominent downturn, according to MOEA statistics.</P>
      <P>Export orders received by Taiwan electronics companies totaled
US$2.11 billion in September, down an alarming 40.19 percent over the
previous September's level, while export orders for other information
technology and telecommunications products and equipment amounted to
US$1.74 billion, down a staggering 36.35 percent.</P>
      <P>Chang Yao-tsung, director general of the MOEA Statistics
Department, said the fallout from the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks has
knocked at least US$1.5-2 billion off Taiwan exporters and
manufacturers' export orders.</P>
      <P>Typhoon Nari, which caused heavy human casualties as well as
extensive property damage when it battered Taiwan in mid-September
with record levels of precipitation, was another major factor in the
unprecedented decline in September export orders, Chang noted.</P>
      <P>Nari and Lekima, another "autumn typhoon," forced an industrial
zone in northern Taiwan and the headquarters of several important
export-oriented enterprises to shut down their operations for at
least one week in September, indirectly contributing to a 15-percent
year-on-year decline in overall manufacturing output for September,
Chang continued.</P>
      <P>According to the MOEA tallies, Taiwan's industrial production
index stood at 112.87 in September, down 7.30 percent from the level
for August and down 14.11 percent from the level for the previous
September.</P>
      <P>On economic prospects in the remaining months of this year, Chang
said the United States' retaliatory actions against terrorists has
added more elements of uncertainty to the global economic outlook.</P>
      <P>Taiwan, with export trade as the backbone of its economic growth,
is expected to continue to be affected by the ongoing U.S.-led
military actions, he said, adding that it will be difficult for
export orders growth to pick up in the fourth quarter and that
industrial production will also remain at a low ebb.</P>
      <P>A recent Department of Statistics survey found that 22.99 percent
of domestic manufacturing companies think export orders will turn for
the better in October, while 40.19 percent think they will remain
unchanged and 36.82 percent believe export orders will decline in
October.</P>

Taipei's representative to this year's informal leadership meeting of
the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum was very
regrettable, the Republic of China government will not backpedal on
its long-term policy of promoting constructive cross-strait
engagements.</P>
      <P>Basically, the official said, the MAC hopes that Taiwan's forced
absence from this year's APEC summit in Shanghai can be regarded as
an isolated case.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, the official admitted that it's still premature to
predict at this moment whether the dispute over the issue of Taiwan's
APEC summit "representation" will affect the future development in
cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan cannot alone dictate cross-strait interaction,
the official said the MAC will keep tabs on the development in
cross-strait interchanges in the wake of the Shanghai APEC summit
over the weekend.</P>
      <P>In reality, the official said, the development in cross-strait
relations hinges on many major factors, including mainland China's
attitude and the general opinions of the people of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In his view, the official said, future cross-strait detente will
hinge on goodwill shown by Beijing.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Minister of Economic Affairs Lin Hsin-yi, who
represented Taiwan at the pre-summit APEC ministerial meeting,
reiterated Monday that Taiwan's absence from the just-concluded APEC
summit will not be a precedent regarding its future participation.</P>
      <P>"Nor will the incident affect Taiwan's imminent entry into the
World Trade Organization (WTO) as a full member," Lin pointed out,
adding that a joint declaration issued at the end of the APEC summit
Sunday reaffirmed the 21-member regional forum's support for Taipei's
and Beijing's WTO accession.</P>
      <P>Both Taipei and Beijing have received official clearance
regarding the terms of their WTO accessions, and the Geneva-based
world trade regulatory body is expected to formally endorse their
memberships at its ministerial meeting scheduled for November in
Qatar.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the APEC fracas will prompt the government to
backtrack on its planned relaxation of restrictions on mainland
China-bound investment, Lin quoted President Chen Shui-bian as having
assured the domestic business community that his administration will
continue preparatory work for carrying out the conclusions reached at
the Economic Development Advisory Conference (EDAC) held in late
August.</P>
      <P>Noting that easing cross-strait investment restrictions under the
"no haste, be patient" policy adopted by the previous Kuomintang
government was one of the major EDAC conclusions, Lin said the
government will not backpedal on its planned trade liberalization
with mainland China.</P>
      <P>Taipei withdrew from this year's APEC summit in Shanghai Friday
over a dispute about who should represent Taiwan. Beijing breached
APEC protocol by not sending a special envoy to deliver an official
invitation to President Chen, and then it refused to accept former
Vice President Li Yuan-zu, Chen's hand-picked proxy, as the ROC
president's representative to the informal leadership summit, which
closed Sunday.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  22  (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>After years of preparations, a group of
scholars, social workers and medical specialists have formed the
"Taiwan Health Reform Foundation" Sunday to monitor the operations of
the nation's medical system.</P>
      <P>Liu Mei-chun, executive officer of the foundation, said that the
quality of medical services in Taiwan is very often questioned. Most
of the unsatisfied patients complained that doctors and hospitals
failed to provide sufficient information about their health
conditions.</P>
      <P>According to results of an Internet survey conducted by the
foundation recently, the public is interested in knowing about
individual medical histories. They also expect that hospitals will
make public such information as the cost of various medical
treatments, irregularities by hospitals or medical personnel, the
financial status of private hospitals and evaluation reports of
hospitals.</P>
      <P>Liu said that many patients and their families found themselves
left in the dark when te doctors wouldn't even bother to explain the
health issues of the patients, except writing quick prescriptions.</P>
      <P>In an earlier survey on the quality of medical services, nearly
half of those responding complained that doctors usually write a
prescription after having spoken to the patient for only five
minutes. Sixty percent said that they had no more than three minutes
to explain their problems to the doctors.</P>
      <P>Many of those polled expressed discontent with the large
expenditures of the National Health Insurance Program.</P>
      <P>The foundation hopes to play an active role in promoting health
reform by coordinating efforts of those in the health field and
social welfare organizations.</P>
      <P>In view of the numerous disputes between patients or their family
members and medical personnel and hospitals, the foundation hopes to
develop a settlement mechanism with a legal basis.</P>
      <P>Liu said that the foundation would conduct surveys on the quality
of medical services every quarter. Every two to three months, the
foundation, together with the media, will sponsor discussions on
health reform.</P>

      <P>Lien Chan, chairman of the largest
opposition party, the Kuomintang (KMT), urged the public on Monday to
put their love of Taiwan into action by joining volunteer services.</P>
      <P>Lien made the remarks during a video shoot for an ad announcing a
program to publicize the awareness of volunteer service called,
"volunteer a day for society."</P>
      <P>Lien and a score of KMT volunteers, armed with brooms, swept an
area of Hsimenting in downtown Taipei Monday. Lien said that
individuals should be lifelong volunteers in the service of society.</P>
      <P>Saying that the original script for the TV ad was somewhat
stilted, Lien improvised some of the lines to make the commercial
sound more natural.</P>
      <P>Lien said that keeping in steps with global efforts in
volunteerism this year, the KMT will set up volunteer teams around
Taiwan, setting disaster relief as their number one goal, with
environmental protection as a priority. The groups will also working
closely to improve society and the environment in general.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  22  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The production value of the Taiwan-based
information technology sector abroad was US$24.8 billion in 2000,
surpassing for the first time its domestic output value of US$23.2
billion, according to the Institute for Information Industry (III).</P>
      <P>During the 1994-2000 period, the overseas output of Taiwan-based
IT firms rose from US$3 billion to US$24.8 billion, while the
sector's domestic production value increased from US$11.5 billion to
US$23.2 billion, III tallies showed. The growth rate of domestic
output between 1994 and 1996 averaged 20 percent, but the percentage
posted noticeable falls over the past four years.</P>
      <P>Officials of the Cabinet-level Council for Economic Planning and
Development (CEPD) said that the increased overseas IT production is
a reflection of the local sector's failure to upgrade its industrial
level. They warned that a continued exodus by local IT firms will
deteriorate the local unemployment situation and lead to a
hollowing-out of the industry.</P>
      <P>According to the CEPD officials, mainland China is the major
production base abroad for Taiwan-based IT companies, which pulled
out 38.6 percent of the total value worth of their orders in the
mainland last year.</P>
      <P>At present, the production value of Taiwan's IT industry was the
world's fourth-largest, lagging behind mainland China in third place,
the CEPD officials said, pointing out that 72 percent of mainland
China's IT output was contributed to by Taiwan-funded companies.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CEPD HEAD DEFENDS IMPLEMENTATION PROGRESS OF EDAC CONCLUSIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  22  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's top economic planner Monday
defended the implementation progress of the 322 conclusions reached
by consensus at the Economic Development Advisory Conference (EDAC)
held in August that was designed to help invigorate the island's
floundering economy.</P>
      <P>Chen Po-chih, chairman of the Cabinet-level Council for Economic
Planning and Development, discounted local media reports that have
said that only 11.8 percent of the EDAC conclusions have been carried
out since the conference was concluded.</P>
      <P>The actual figure, Chen said at a news conference, is 91 percent.</P>
      <P>Chen said he had to listen to his conscience and called the news
conference "to right the wrongs" that were produced by "distorted
reports" by some media.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian initiated the EDAC to chart a path for
the island through the present economic slump. More than 100 economic
and trade officials, scholars and specialists, and business leaders
took part in the three-day conference. Participants agreed by
consensus on 322 recommendations to tackle pressing national issues
including the rising unemployment rate, Taiwan's worsening investment
environment, the amelioration of cross-Taiwan Strait economic and
trade relations, the declining competition of local industries and
the increasing seriousness of the local financial situation.</P>
      <P>Chen said most of the EDAC conclusions have been taken care of in
accordance with the special demands of each.</P>
      <P>For example, he noted, 34 conclusions have been written as draft
bills and forwarded to the Legislative Yuan for screening in hopes
that they will be promulgated during the current legislative session.</P>
      <P>Eighty others have technically been turned into administrative
orders for implementation, he said, adding that it was agreed by EDAC
participants that consensuses reached in the cross-strait affairs
group would not be restricted to a fixed timetable for
implementation.</P>
      <P>Instead, according to Chen, the participants decided to keep the
cross-strait business and trade policies flexible and readjust them
in accordance with the timing of both sides' accession into the World
Trade Organization and actual interactions between the two sides'
business and trade sectors.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, former premier and chairman of the Cross-Strait Common
Market Foundation, Vincent Siew said the 322 conclusions are critical
to Taiwan's economic development and their implementation should not
be put off because of political factors, such as the year-end
elections of legislators, city mayors and county chiefs.</P>
      <P>Chi Schive, president of the Taiwan Academy of Banking and
Finance, said the 322 EDAC conclusions are actually a hodgepodge of
ideas involving too many areas.</P>
      <P>He said that not all of the conclusions are applicable and the
government should screen those conclusions before putting them on a
timetable for implementation.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROSTER OF GOVERNMENT RESTRUCTURING COMMITTEE RELEASED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  22  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The roster of a long-planned government
restructuring committee was unveiled Monday, with President Chen
Shui-bian serving as its chairman.</P>
      <P>Yu Shyi-kun, secretary-general to the president, said President
Chen has also appointed Premier Chang Chun-hsiung and Examination
Yuan President Hsu Shui-teh as vice chairmen of the new body.</P>
      <P>Yu himself has been named the chief executive of the committee,
while Vice Premier Lai Ing-jaw will be the deputy chief executive.</P>
      <P>"President Chen has also approved a list of 23 other members of
the committee," Yu said, adding that the president hand-picked the
members from government, academic and business circles.</P>
      <P>Yu chaired a preparatory meeting earlier in the day to set the
agenda for the committee's first conference to be held Thursday as
well as its ultimate goals.</P>
      <P>Participants to the preparatory meeting, mainly senior staff
members of relevant government agencies, also discussed the
committee's organic rules which are expected to be formalized at the
body's inaugural meeting, Yu said.</P>
      <P>According to the organic rules, the committee's primary missions
are drafting a comprehensive blueprint for government restructuring,
division of labor and resources between central and local governments
as well as relevant personnel system reform.</P>
      <P>The committee will be authorized to set up seven divisions to
conduct project research and administrative affairs, including
planning and research, secretariat, conference affairs, general
affairs, news releases, personnel and accounting divisions.</P>
      <P>The new committee comprises 10 government officials, 11 academics
and four senior industry and business executives. The government
officials in the committee include Yu, Vice Premier Lai, Cabinet
Secretary-General Chiou I-jen, Examination Yuan Secretary-General Hsu
Ching-fu and Lin Chuan, director-general of Budget, Accounting and
Statistics.</P>
      <P>The four members from the business community are Nita Ing,
chairwoman of the Taiwan High-Speed Railway Corp.; Acer Group
Chairman Stan Shih; Chi-Mei Group Chairman Hsu Wen-lung; and Wei
Chi-lin, chairman of Land Bank of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Noting that the formation of a government restructuring committee
is one of the major conclusions reached at the high-profile Economic
Development Advisory Conference in late August, Yu said the
committee's first meeting scheduled for Thursday will mark the
beginning of the Republic of China government's largest-ever
downsizing plan since the implementation of the Organization Law of
the Executive Yuan (or Cabinet) in March 1947.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Research, Development and Evaluation Commission
came up with a draft executive branch restructuring plan earlier this
year. Under the plan, the number of the Executive Yuan's current 36
ministries and commissions will be trimmed to 25.</P>
      <P>The draft package will be submitted to the newly formed
restructuring committee for discussion and a final version is
scheduled to be referred to the Legislative Yuan for deliberation and
approval next February.</P>
      <P>"We hope that the new legislature to be elected Dec. 1 can pass
all proposed revisions to the existing Executive Yuan Organization
Law by next April to pave the way for a sweeping overhaul of the
executive branch," Yu said.</P>
      <P>Then President Chen hopes to carry out structural reforms of the
Judicial Yuan, the Examination Yuan and the Control Yuan, Yu said,
adding that the overall government restructuring plan in scheduled to
be completed in two years.</P>
      <P>Political analysts said Taiwan has lagged far behind the United
States, Japan, many European countries and even mainland China in
government restructuring. In their view, political factors have been
the biggest obstacles to the long-talked-about and much-needed
government downsizing.</P>
      <P>Government sources said Presdient Chen has done his utmost to
exclude political considerations in selecting members of the
restructuring committee to ensure the success of the ambitious reform
plan.</P>
      <P>"The committee roster is composed of members with expertise or
backgrounds in constitutional affairs, public administration,
organizational management, self-government, sociology and business
management," said a government official who preferred anonymity.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  22  (CNA)
(By David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Nearly 15,000 workers have been hired as
temporary workers under a government emergency employment plan aimed
at reconstructing areas damaged by recent typhoons, sources with the
Employment and Vocational Training Administration (EVTA) said Monday.</P>
      <P>The EVTA, which is responsible for carrying out the plan, said
that as of Oct. 19, more than 19,000 people were recommended by all
local employment service centers and 14,979 were employed and have
begun working since the EVTA publicized the plan Oct. 1, the sources
said.</P>
      <P>A task force for promoting domestic employment under the
Executive Yuan originally earmarked NT$400 million (about US$11.59
million) for the plan with the number of workers employed set at
10,000, EVTA sources said.</P>
      <P>However, the employment promoting task force decided later to
raise the fund to NT$600 million because the number of workers
recommended by all local employment service centers far exceeded that
set by the task force.</P>
      <P>The more-than-expected number of workers applying for one-month
temporary jobs indicates that times are indeed tough, the sources
said.</P>
      <P>The workers hired under the emergency employment plan are to be
engaged mainly in the clearing up of street drains and repairs in
towns hit by the typhoons. They will end their work at the end of
this month.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT CALLS FOR UPGRADING OF PUBLIC AWARENESS OF ANTHRAX</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  22  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian urged relevant
government agencies to heighten alert on all possible forms of
terrorist biowarfare and take effective steps to help enhance public
awareness of anthrax risk.</P>
      <P>Chen gave the directives after presiding over the fourth
high-level national security meeting regarding the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks in the United States.</P>
      <P>Noting that the current U.S.-led war on global terrorism is an
unprecedented new type of warfare, Chen said international
terrorist organizations have not only threatened the U.S. domestic
security but has also posed great threat to global stability and
values.</P>
      <P>A U.S.-proposed anti-terrorism statement issued at the end of
this year's informal leadership meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) forum in Shanghai Sunday indicates that
counter-terrorism has become a prevailing international stance, Chen
said.</P>
      <P>"Although Taiwan was forced to absent itself from the Shanghai
APEC summit in protest against Beijing's rude discrimination," Chen
pointed out, "the government has pledged its adamant support for the
ongoing global anti-terrorism campaign."</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, Chen said, all relevant government
agencies should remember this promise and come up with concrete work
plans in follow-up APEC working meetings.</P>
      <P>"We should actively take part in various action plans in
intelligence and information exchanges, security inspections,
anti-money laundering and strengthening of energy security," Chen
explained.</P>
      <P>He further said although the Republic of China is not a U.N.
member, the executive and legislative branches should work together
to substantiate the various U.N.-initiated anti-terrorism
conventions and resolutions in domestic laws and statutes.</P>
      <P>"As the ROC-U.S. judicial assistance agreement, initialed by the
two sides earlier this year, forms an integral part of bilateral
cooperation in crackdown on cross-border organized crime and acts of
terror," Chen said, "I hope the executive branch can lobby the
legislature to ratify the accord during its current session."</P>
      <P>In view of gradual spread of anthrax infections, Chen said,
relevant government agencies should step up precautions. In addition
to staging anti-anthrax drills and intensifying publicity campaign,
he said, the government should start evaluation and planning of
vaccine purchases and supply sources.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT REBUTS FORMER PARTY CHAIRMAN'S CRITICISM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  22  (CNA)
(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) issued a
statement Monday to rebut former party chairman Lee Teng-hui's
criticism of the party and the party's leaders.</P>
      <P>Lee stepped down from the KMT chairmanship following the party's
defeat in the March 18, 2000 presidential election. His party
membership was revoked in September mainly because he decided to
stump for candidates of the newly formed Taiwan Solidarity Union
(TSU).</P>
      <P>Over the past few weeks, Lee has openly criticized the KMT,
accusing it of "joining hands with communist China to oppose Taiwan."
He has also described KMT leaders as "bad people."</P>
      <P>With the approach of elections for legislators, county
magistrates and city mayors Dec. 1, and Lee's continued criticism of
the KMT while stumping for TSU candidates, the KMT issued a statement
to clarify the party's position.</P>
      <P>The statement claimed that as the "spiritual leader" of the TSU,
Lee has distorted facts to hurt the KMT.</P>
      <P>It noted that the KMT took steps to revoke Lee's party membership
in line with past practice adopted to revoke the party memberships of
former Premier Hau Pei-tsun and former Judicial Yuan President Lin
Yang-kang at a time when Lee was serving as KMT chairman and ROC
president.</P>
      <P>Lee has described the KMT administration as a "foreign
administration" and noted that he worked with the "KMT bad fellows"
for many long years.</P>
      <P>The statement asked: "Why did the KMT administration -- which Lee
once headed -- become a foreign administration and why did the KMT
leaders become bad follows soon after Lee quit?"</P>
      <P>It also stressed that the KMT's policy toward mainland China is
against the communist system, not against the mainland people, and
added that the party is against Taiwan independence because it might
cause a military showdown across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The statement said that the KMT's mainland policy, adopted when
Lee was party chairman, remains unchanged, and added that "the one
who has changed is Lee, not the party."</P>
      <P>"The KMT is striving to protect Taiwan and oppose the
communists," it pointed out, denying Lee's claim that the KMT was
"uniting with communist China to oppose Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Regarding Lee's criticism that the KMT was "dragging at the legs"
of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) government because the KMT
could not endure losing power to the DPP, the statement said that if
Lee's remarks were true, the KMT would not have presented advice on
economic development to the new government and would not have
participated in the Economic Development Advisory Conference.</P>
      <P>The statement said that although Lee has quit the KMT, the KMT
has not denied Lee's contributions to the party and the country.</P>
      <P>It said that the party has learned from its defeat in last year's
presidential election and is striving to promote democratization with
a hope of regaining voter confidence in the year-end elections.</P>
      <P>As no single party is expected to win a simple majority in the
225-seat Legislative Yuan in the elections, the KMT and the DPP are
struggling to become the biggest party.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian has stated that he will form a coalition
government after the elections, regardless of the results of the
elections.</P>

(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian
has asked Minister of Foreign Affairs Tien Hung-mao to attend the
Nov. 23 memorial service in Hawaii for Chang Hsueh-liang, who
kidnapped Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek in 1936 in the so-called Xian
Incident.</P>
      <P>Tien, who left for Hawaii Monday, said President Chen asked him
to attend Chang's memorial service and bestow Chang a citation in
order to convey his deepest condolence.</P>
      <P>Cecilia Yen, wife of Koo Chen-fu, chairman of the Strait Exchange
Foundation, will represent Madame Chiang to convey her condolence to
Chang's family in the service. She said she thinks Chang was a great
Chinese and one of the most influential figures in modern Chinese
history, who changed the history of China.</P>
      <P>Chang, born in 1901, succeeded his father, a warlord who
dominated northeastern China after the ROC was founded in 1911, as
leader of his father's militia, called the Northeastern Army.</P>
      <P>In order to integrate the Northeastern Army into the forces of
the Nationalist government, Chiang, who led the nationalists at the
time, named Chang as the commander-in-chief of the army in
northeastern China in 1926.</P>
      <P>However, Chang and his followers were expelled from their
stronghold when the Japanese Imperial Army invaded China in 1931 and
occupied northeastern China. Chang, who was eager to drive the
Japanese out of northeastern China, was at odds with Chiang, who
wanted to use Chang's army to fight against the burgeoning Chinese
Communists.</P>
      <P>Chang took Chiang hostage in Xian Dec. 12, 1936 in an attempt to
force him to join with the communists to fight the Japanese.</P>
      <P>Chang was persuaded by Chiang to give up his attempt and submit
himself to the Nanking-based Nationalist government for discipline.
Chang escorted Chiang to Nanking two weeks later, ending the
so-called Xian Incident.</P>
      <P>Chang was then put under house arrest for nearly half a century
after moving to Taiwan along with the ROC government in 1949.</P>
      <P>Chang was granted relative freedom of movement on the island in
1988 by then-President Lee Teng-hui and was allowed to move to
Honolulu in 1993.</P>
      <P>The citation bestowed by President Chen hails Chang as a
patriotic figure, who pledged allegiance to the Central Government
despite the Japanese threat and contributed significantly to the
unification of the country.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Premier Chang Chun-hsiung
Monday expressed hope that the Legislative Yuan will convene an
extraordinary session in mid-November to approve documents required
for Taiwan's accession into the World Trade Organization (WTO).</P>
      <P>The WTO ministerial meeting will be held in Qatar Nov. 9-13, and
if everything goes smoothly, the documents for Taiwan's entry into
the global trade regulatory body will be formally recognized at the
meeting.</P>
      <P>As the Legislative Yuan will go into a one-month recess Nov. 1 in
preparation for the Dec. 1 elections for legislators, county
magistrates and city mayors, Chang said he hopes the extraordinary
session will be called after the Qatar meeting so as to approve the
relevant WTO documents.</P>
      <P>Once approved by the Legislative Yuan, the documents will be
submitted by the Executive Yuan to the Presidential Office and to the
WTO secretariat. One month later, Taiwan will become a formal WTO
member.</P>
      <P>Chang also said that he and President Chen Shui-bian had
exchanged views with Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng on the
WTO issue and that the Legislative Yuan should be able to enact all
bills required for Taiwan's WTO membership in the coming days.</P>
      <P>In this connection, Democratic Progressive Party legislative
caucus leader Tsai Huang-lang said Monday that the legislative
caucuses from the ruling and opposition parties had agreed to call a
plenary session Oct. 31 to handle WTO-related bills.</P>
      <P>Because of the lack of time, he said, the legislative caucuses

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT'S WORDS ON '1992 CONSENSUS' MAY AFFECT STABILITY: KMT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  22  (CNA)
(By Edward Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian's denial of the
"1992 consensus" will have a serious impact on cross-strait
stability, said the former chairman of the Cabinet-level Mainland
Affair Council (MAC) under the Kuomintang-led administration Monday.</P>
      <P>Su Chi, convener of the national security section under the
National Policy Foundation, a think tank for the KMT, said he was
worried about the remarks that Chen made at a ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) election campaign rally for Hualien
magistrate candidate Yu Ying-lung Sunday.</P>
      <P>Chen said that opposition parties have forced him to accept "one
country, two systems," the 1992 consensus, and the "one China"
principle. Their purpose, he said, is to eliminate the Republic of
China and sell out Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Su further pointed out that if President Chen and former
President Lee Teng-hui form an alliance after the year-end elections,
the cross-strait situation will undoubtedly further deteriorate. The
KMT will keep a close eye on developments, Su said.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan independence and a ban on nuclear power are
two of the basic tenets of the DPP, Su said he wondered what could be
next from the ruling party.</P>
      <P>Su said that the Fourth Nuclear Power Plant was the foundation of
the island's economic development and that the "1992 consensus" was
the bedrock on which cross-strait stabilization rested, adding that
he thinks President Chen's expression was purely to attract votes.</P>
      <P>The former KMT-led administration developed cross-strait
relations based on the principle of "one China with different
interpretations" and the "1992 consensus," Su said. Former President
Lee, Chairman of the Strait Exchange Foundation Koo Chen-fu and
former Premier Vincent Siew used these terms during their terms in
office and no one claimed that by using them, the KMT was selling out
Taiwan, Su said.</P>
      <P>Su also believed that Chen's remarks on the "1992 consensus" was
going "far beyond the course" and said that President Chen could not
put "one country, two systems" and the "one China with different
interpretations" on an equal footing.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chairman of the People First Party (PFP) James Soong
criticized President Chen's remarks on the "1992 consensus" saying
that his comments ran encounter to the majority opinions of the
ruling and opposition parties.</P>
      <P>PFP spokesman Hsieh Kung-ping said that even DPP Chairman Frank
Hsieh has said that only by returning to the "one China" principle
under the Republic of China Constitution framework could the
cross-strait dispute be resolved. This was advocated by both the
ruling and opposition parties, Hsieh quoted Soong as saying.</P>
      <P>The PFP strongly opposes "one country, two systems, " or "one
country, three systems" since they will downgrade Taiwan's status and
could be construed to eliminate the ROC, Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>Referring to the "1992 consensus," Hsieh said that the issue was
under discussion by the ruling and opposition parties but President
Chen came out and said that was to sell out Taiwan. President Chen
was intentionally trying to provoke reaction from both sides of the
independence/renunciation issue, Hsieh quoted Soong as saying.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENTIAL OFFICE DENIES PLAYING `ELECTION TRICKS' WITH APEC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  22  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Presidential Office spokesman denied
accusations by lawmakers Monday that the government had "played a
trick" by skipping this year's Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
(APEC) forum summit in an attempt to solicit public support for the
coming elections.</P>
      <P>Kuo Yao-chi, director-general of the Presidential Office, was
reponding to accusations by main opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
legislators Kwan Yuk-noan, Fan Yang-sheng and Yang Tzou-chow, who
claimed that the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)-led government
made up its mind not to attend the APEC summit last weekend as a
means of winning votes for the ruling party in the year-end
legislative and county chief elections.</P>
      <P>According to the lawmakers, the government acted in the hope that
Beijing's snub to Taiwan would create an anti-mainland China backlash
at home, which could translate into extra votes for the
pro-independence DPP.</P>
      <P>The three KMT lawmakers were members of the Taiwan delegation at
the APEC ministerial-level meetings, which was led by Council for
Economic Planing and Development Chairman Chen Po-chih and Minister
of Economic Affairs Lin Hsin-yi.</P>
      <P>Saying it is a pity that Taiwan did not take part in the
gathering and thereby lost the chance to boost its international
presence, they said that the government's insistence on sending
former Vice President Li Yuan-zu as President Chen Shui-bian's sole
proxy at the summit had prevented Taipei officials from negotiating
with flexibility on the issue.</P>
      <P>They also criticized Lin's performance, blaming the minister for
having been "too scared" to speak out for Taiwan on public occasions.</P>
      <P>Calling the KMT lawmakers' speculation "totally incorrect," Kuo
said the government had done its best to prepare for the APEC summit
from the very beginning. She added that the government was forced to
make the withdrawal announcement at the last minute because it had
not received a formal invitation from host mainland China.</P>
      <P>Kuo noted that the APEC summit is an important international
event for Taiwan and stressed that the government would never have
thought of seeking to court public backing for elections by choosing
to skip the gathering.</P>

      <P>Republic of China Economics Minister Lin
Hsin-yi said Monday that any change to the date or venue of a World
Trade Organization (WTO) minister's meeting is not expected to affect
Taiwan's entry into the organization.</P>
      <P>Lin made the remarks in the fourth high-level national security
meeting, presided over by President Chen Shui-bian, following the
Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on the United States.</P>
      <P>Due to the security concerns following the attacks and the U.S.
military retaliation against the Taliban regime in Afghanistan, there
have been suggestions that the WTO should change the venue of a WTO
ministerial meeting scheduled for November in Qatar.</P>
      <P>The meeting is expected to approve the admission of both Taiwan
and mainland China to the world trade regulatory body.</P>
      <P>Asked whether Taiwan -- which withdrew from the just-concluded
informal summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum
-- would have its WTO admission affected, Lin said he sees no such
implication.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, a statement from the APEC informal summit
reaffirmed its support for WTO entry for both sides of the Taiwan
Strait.</P>
      <P>Lin also presented a report regarding ROC economic strategy
following the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</P>
      <P>According to the report, the Ministry of Economic Affairs will
keep a close eye on the situation in Afghanistan, help local
enterprises to explore markets that are less affected by the U.S.
military action, such as Japan, South Korea, Southeast Asia and
mainland China, and assist them to take advantage of trade
opportunities related to survival equipment, computers and
telecommunications.</P>
      <P>However, Lin refused to comment on the 26.81 percent drop in

    <TEXT>
      <P>A Taipei official said Monday that Taiwan's
absence from the 2001 informal leadership conference of the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum in Shanghai will not
affect Taiwan's bid to join the World Trade Organization (WTO).</P>
      <P>Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) Chairman
Chen Po-chih, who led the Taiwan mission to the APEC ministerial
meeting, told reporters that the incident will also not affect the
government's policy of "cultivating Taiwan with a global
perspective."</P>
      <P>Because Beijing's failure to follow the APEC protocol of sending
an official to Taipei to deliver an invitation to the leadership
conference, Taiwan was forced to withdraw from the gathering at the
last minute.</P>
      <P>Chen said that the APEC incident and WTO accession are two
independent cases and added that the United States has stated that
Taiwan's APEC participation and WTO activities in the future will not
be affected by the incident.</P>
      <P>A WTO ministerial meeting in Qatar next month is expected to
admit the entry bids from both mainland China and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Regarding the future development of cross-Taiwan Strait economic
and trade relations, the CEPD chief said that the direction will
change to "cultivating Taiwan with a mainland perspective."</P>
      <P>In the past, he said, Taiwan worked to open its market to foreign
investment, whereas the new direction is to place more emphasis on
expanding to foreign lands.</P>
      <P>Chen said that the government's policy toward mainland China will
become more positive than before and added that the mainland will be
included as one of the bases for "cultivating Taiwan with a global
perspective."</P>
      <P>Chen admitted that the mainland is the best place for investment
for many industries, but added that it is not the only possible base
for Taiwan's development and that its importance should not be
exaggerated.</P>
      <P>The recent Economic Development Advisory Conference proposed that
the government replace its "go slow, be patient" policy with "active
opening, effective management" in dealing with investment relations
with the mainland, a proposal that the government decided to accept.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NUMBER OF FOREIGN LABORERS IN TAIWAN FALLS TO 319,000</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  22  (CNA)
(By David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The number of foreign laborers in Taiwan
fell to 319,240 in September, a decrease of 1,587 from the previous
month, according to statistics released Monday by the Council of
Labor Affairs (CLA).</P>
      <P>It was the third consecutive monthly drop in the number of
foreign laborers in Taiwan, the CLA said. The September figure was
nearly 10,000 less than that of the peak month, it added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the number of foreign household caregivers in
September totaled 105,873, an increase of 362 from the August figure.
Foreign household caregivers still comprised the majority of foreign
laborers in September, according to the CLA statistics.</P>
      <P>The number of foreign household caregivers in August had
registered a negative growth from the previous month and CLA
officials attributed the September increase to revisions of
regulations governing the hiring of foreign household caretakers.</P>
      <P>When the government opened its doors to foreign laborers in the
early 1990's, only the families of patients with a level of 60 or
lower on Barthel's score -- a measurement used to evaluate the
physical and mental condition of patients -- were allowed to hire
foreign caregivers.</P>
      <P>In July 2000, the CLA revised its regulations to require a
Barthel's score of less than 20, a much more stringent requirement.</P>
      <P>A Barthel's level of 20 or lower means that a physically disabled
or mentally ill patient is "totally dependent," while a level of 40
or below on the score means that the patient is "heavily dependent."</P>
      <P>The CLA amended the regulation again in July 2001 to loosen the
standard to a Barthel's score of 40 or lower.</P>
      <P>The same CLA statistics show that the number of foreign
housemaids in September amounted to 9,112, a month-on-month growth of
104.</P>
      <P>The number of foreign laborers working in the low-tech
manufacturing sector in September stood at 10,002, an increase of 161
over the previous month, while the number of foreign laborers working
in the high-tech manufacturing sector totaled 245, a growth of eight,
according to the statistics.</P>
      <P>The number of foreign laborers working in the government's major
construction projects in September reached 32,621, a month-on-month
increase of 544, according to the statistics.</P>

extending the TAIEX's trading hours is inevitable.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FOREIGN MINISTER ATTENDS CHIANG KAI-SHEK KIDNAPPER'S MEMORIAL SERVICE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>San  Francisco,  Oct.  22  (CNA)
(By Neil Lu and Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China's foreign
minister arrived in Hawaii Monday to attend the memorial service for
Chang Hsueh-liang, a key figure in ROC history who kidnapped
Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek in 1936 in the so-called Xian Incident.</P>
      <P>Arriving a day before his scheduled attendance at the service on
behalf of ROC President Chen Shui-bian, Minister of Foreign Affairs
Tien Hung-mao met with Chang's family to convey Chen's condolences
and to bestow a posthumous citation on Chang for his contributions to
the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>Cecilia Yen, wife of Koo Chen-fu, chairman of Taiwan's Straits
Exchange Foundation, will represent Madame Chiang at the service to
convey Chiang's condolences.</P>
      <P>Chang was born in 1901 and succeeded his father -- a warlord who
dominated northeastern China after the Republic of China was founded
in 1911 -- as leader of his father's militia, called the Northeastern
Army.</P>
      <P>In order to integrate the Northeastern Army into the forces of
the Nationalist government, Chiang, who led the Nationalists at the
time, named Chang as the commander in chief of the Nationalist army
in northeastern China in 1926.</P>
      <P>However, Chang and his followers were expelled from their
stronghold when Japanese Imperial forces invaded China in 1931 and
occupied northeastern China. Chang, who was eager to drive the
Japanese out of the region, was at odds with Chiang, who wanted to
use Chang's army to fight against the burgeoning Chinese Communists.</P>
      <P>Chang took Chiang hostage in Xian Dec. 12, 1936 in an attempt to
force him to join forces with the Communists to fight the Japanese.</P>
      <P>Chang was persuaded by Chiang to give up his attempt and submit
himself to the Nanking-based Nationalist government for discipline.
Chang escorted Chiang to Nanking two weeks later, ending the
so-called Xian Incident.</P>
      <P>Chang was then put under house arrest for nearly half a century
after moving to Taiwan along with the ROC government in 1949.</P>
      <P>He was granted relative freedom of movement on the island in 1988
by then-President Lee Teng-hui and was allowed to move to Honolulu in
1993.</P>
      <P>The citation bestowed by President Chen hails Chang as a
patriotic figure who pledged allegiance to the Nationalist government
despite the Japanese threat and contributed significantly to the
unification of the country.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Canada welcomes the democratic reforms and
transformations in Taiwan, Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister John
Manley said in a letter to the Taiwanese-Canadian Association dated
Oct. 16.</P>
      <P>In the letter, Manley said the positive changes brought about by
Taiwan's "young and dynamic democracy" will continue to create
greater opportunities for the development and expansion of contacts
between the people of Taiwan and Canada.</P>
      <P>The letter was addressed to Ms. Mireille Lin, the association's
president, who presented a petition to the Canadian government Sept.
5 on behalf of association members across Canada calling on Canada
and other major democracies to welcome Taiwan to become a member of
the United Nations and other international organizations.</P>
      <P>"As you noted in your letter, Canada recognizes the People's
Republic of China as the sole legitimate government of China. Canada
does not have diplomatic relations with Taiwan, but encourages
economic, cultural and people-to-people contacts," the minister said.</P>
      <P>Without mentioning Taiwan's official name -- the Republic of
China -- Manley said that "Canada will continue to work
constructively with Chinese Taipei within the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) forum."</P>
      <P>The Republic of China on Taiwan is a member of APEC, the

    <TEXT>
      <P>A senior Republic of China Army official
said Tuesday that the military will participate in an upcoming
cross-ministerial drill to demonstrate its preparedness for a
biochemical terrorist attack.</P>
      <P>Maj. Gen. Chang Chin-teh, who heads the chemical warfare
department at the ROC Army General Headquarters, said at a routine
news conference at the Ministry of National Defense (MND) that the
chemical warfare group of the Sixth Field Army will take part in the
exercise scheduled for Saturday.</P>
      <P>Chang said that the Army has teams in northern, central, southern
and eastern Taiwan that can quickly identify and neutralize chemical
agents on the spot.</P>
      <P>He added that the military has a comprehensive protective
mechanism in place against chemical attacks and conducts frequent
drills to rehearse related procedures.</P>
      <P>The Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) is in charge of
organizing the upcoming exercise, which will simulate a biochemical
attack on a crowded Taipei Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) station.</P>
      <P>The MND, the Ministry of Transportation and Communications, the
Department of Health, the National Police Administration, the
National Fire Administration and the Coast Patrol Administration are
jointly participating in the event.</P>
      <P>The same government agencies staged a similar drill last Friday
at the same location. In that exercise, a mock terrorist released
noxious gases in the MRT's Hsiaonanmen Station, and the government
mobilized police, medical, EPA and chemical warfare personnel to
handle the ensuing crisis.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian on Monday urged relevant government
agencies to heighten their alert against all possible forms of
terrorist biowarfare and to take effective steps to help enhance
public awareness of the anthrax threat.</P>
      <P>Chen gave the directives after presiding over the fourth
high-level national security meeting regarding the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks in the United States.</P>
      <P>In addition to staging anti-anthrax drills and intensifying the
campaign to inform the public, he said, the government should start

    <HEADLINE>ITRI INTRODUCING GERMAN EXPERIENCE IN PHYTOMEDICINAL RESEARCH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Oct.   23  (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Industrial Technology Research
Institute (ITRI) will sponsor a seminar at the Grand Hotel in Taipei
Wednesday, introducing German experience in research and development
in herbal medicine and international marketing of phytomedicines.</P>
      <P>A spokesman of the research institute said Tuesday that experts
from the renown German drug manufacturer Dr. Willmar Schwabe
Pharmaceuticals as well as university professors have been invited to
speak at the seminar.</P>
      <P>Dr. Willmar Schwabe Pharmaceuticals specializes in the field of
plant-derived pharmaceuticals. One of the company's most renown
products is ensaculin, a neuronal activator for the treatment of
Alzheimer's disease. Derived from naturally occurring coumarins,
ensaculin has been proven in clinical trials to be able to stimulate
interaction with several transmitter/receptor systems, which are
known to be diminished by Alzheimer's disease.</P>
      <P>The spokesman said that the Chinese have used herbs in medical
treatment for thousands of years, adding that the government has
instructed the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the ITRI to advance
the herbal medicine research and development as well as its
commercialization.</P>
      <P>He also pointed out that in terms of clinical studies, regulatory
status and international marketing, the Chinese have much to learn
from the West.</P>

to be delivered at the seminar, including one titled "Industrial
Research and Clinical Studies," by Dr. Karl-Heinz Stumpf, managing
director and head of the Research and Development Division of Dr.

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN CAN BECOME WTO MEMBER DEC. 10 AT EARLIEST</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  23  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan will become a full member of the
World Trade Organization (WTO) 30 days after Nov. 10 if the
Legislative Yuan convenes a special session to give its stamp of
approval, a Ministry of Economic Affairs official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Quoting WTO Director-General Mike Moore, the official said the
fourth WTO ministerial meeting will be held in the Gulf state of
Qatar from Nov. 9-13 as originally scheduled.</P>
      <P>Earlier this month, the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post
reported that the WTO is expected to formally endorse mainalnd
China's accession terms Nov. 10 and that mainland China's National
People's Congress will convene an extraordinary session on the same
day to ratify the mainland entry protocol for immediate delivery to
the WTO Secretariat.</P>
      <P>Under current WTO regulations, an applicant's membership bid will
take effect 30 days after its accession protocol is sent to the
Secretariat of the Geneva-based world trade regulatory body.</P>
      <P>The WTO has agreed in principle to simultaneously approve the
accession protocols of the two sides of the Taiwan Strait. Taiwan's
legislature, however, will be in recess when the WTO passes the
island's accession protocol Nov. 10.</P>
      <P>"We hope the legislature can convene a special session that day
to ratify the protocol lest Taiwan lag behind mainland China," the
official said, adding that if mainland China enters the WTO before
Taiwan, it may try to bar Taiwan's accession using the excuse of
Taiwan's restrictions on direct cross-strait trade and transportation
links.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, the official said, the executive and
legislative branches of the government should work hand in hand to
complete all formalities in time to ensure simultaneous WTO entry
with mainland China.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Legislative Yuan approved a proposal earlier in
the day to screen all WTO-related bills Oct. 30-31, the chamber's
last two working days before the Dec. 1 legislative elections.</P>
      <P>In view of the legislature's hectic work schedule in the run-up
to the upcoming elections, legislative caucuses of ruling and
opposition parties also agreed Tuesday that the 20-plus WTO-related
bills can be put up for second readings directly.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FORMER ROC PRESIDENT DEFENDS `SPECIAL STATE-TO-STATE' THEORY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  23  (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Republic of China President Lee
Teng-hui said Tuesday that the "special state-to-state" model he
proposed in 1999 to characterize Taipei-Beijing relations has already
become the "bottom line" in bilateral negotiations.</P>
      <P>Lee said at the opening of an Academia Historica seminar on 20th
century Taiwanese history and notable figures that there is no longer
a question of the so-called "1992 consensus" or the "one China"
principle in cross-Taiwan Strait relations.</P>
      <P>His concept was the result of two years' study based on the works
of domestic and foreign legal experts, he added.</P>
      <P>Lee said that at the time in July 1999 when he first brought up
the concept in an interview with a German reporter, Beijing had been
preparing to announce to the world on its national day in October
that its top cross-strait envoy was scheduled to visit Taiwan to
discuss its "one country, two systems" formula.</P>
      <P>That was the reason that Wan Daohan, the head of Beijing's
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait, had been forced
by Beijing to delay his scheduled visit, Lee said.</P>
      <P>Lee went on to say that he believed the situation was very
serious because the world would have been given the message that "the
Republic of China has been destroyed" if Beijing had been able to
make its announcement.</P>
      <P>He said that "one country, two systems" is obviously not a good
system because Hong Kong has only been governed under that formula
for less than four years, yet "things have already become this bad."</P>
      <P>Lee stressed that Taiwan must maintain its sovereignty in order
to ensure its national security and dignity.</P>
      <P>After Lee presented his "two states" model -- which was seen to
be a departure from the ROC government's previous stance that
characterized cross-strait relations as "one China, with each side
free to interpret that term individually" -- tension in the Taiwan
Strait increased noticeably and Beijing froze all dialogue and
negotiations with Taipei.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN'S JOBLESS RATE HITS RECORD HIGH OF 5.26 PERCENT IN SEPTEMBER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 23 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's jobless rate hit a record high of
5.26 percent in September and is expected to continue to rise in the
next three months, the Directorate General of the Budget, Accounting
and Statistics (DGBAS) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>DGBAS officials said the number of people who lost their job due
to plant closures or scaledowns in September stood at a new high of
245,000, or an increase of 14,000 from the previous month. Most of
the jobless are middle-aged or a little older -- people who are
traditionally the family breadwinners.</P>
      <P>The officials, therefore, estimated as many as 1.18 million
individuals may be affected by the jobless situation.</P>
      <P>The officials noted that the jobless rate this September had not
decreased as in the past, indicating that the job market is still
sluggish, although first-time job seekers decreased by 4,000 from the
previous month.</P>
      <P>The number employed in September stood at 9.35 million, down
28,000 from the previous month.</P>
      <P>The officials said that due to the terrorist attacks in the
United States and the sluggish world economy, the jobless rate in the
next three months is expected to stay high, with the average rate
hovering around 5 percent in the fourth quarter and the year's
average estimated to be above 4.5 percent.</P>
      <P>The officials said that sluggish demand in the high-tech industry
was responsible for the jobless rate in Hsinchu, the home of
hundreds of hi-tech companies, to rise dramatically. The jobless
problem has spread from the central and southern parts of the island
to the north.</P>
      <P>The officials said that the jobless rate gap between southern and
northern Taiwan shrank dramatically in September. Sixteen out of 23
counties and cities reported a jobless rate of over 5 percent and
only the offshore island of Penghu reported a jobless rate of under 4
percent.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a labor union in Kaohsiung, southern Taiwan, appealed
to Kaohsiung Mayor Frank Hsieh, asking him to make good on a promise
to create 10,000 new jobs after the mass rapid transit system starts
construction.</P>
      <P>The 60 laborers, representing those out of work and those who are
worried about losing their jobs, shouted, "We want work, and give us
10,000 jobs."</P>
      <P>Labor representative Yeh Kao-ping said that during the past 17
months of the current government, the political situation has been
unstable, the economy has been sluggish, and the jobless rate has
continued to rise, adding that the jobless rate in Kaohsiung City
reached 5.56 percent in August, or the second-highest in Taiwan,
which he said was not because the opposition was not cooperating with
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) as the DPP has claimed.</P>
      <P>Yeh asked Hsieh, who serves concurrently as DPP chairman, to make
good of his promise to create jobs, and that the employment of
Kaohsiung laborers will be given preference.</P>

Central Deposits Corp. on Aug. 10 put under supervision 36 local
financial institutions, of which 27 were credit departments of
farmers' associations.</P>
      <P>In early September, the finance ministry announced that 35 local
financial institutions, mostly credit departments of farmers'
associations, would be taken over by public banks in mid-September.
Employees of these associations, being laid off without proper
compensation, took to the street to protest against the indifference
of the authorities.</P>
      <P>Agricultural officials said that the tension between the
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) administration and the local
farmers' associations was obvious, and the forthcoming elections of
legislators as well as mayors and county magistrates have complicated
the confrontation.</P>
      <P>Farmers' associations were traditionally strongholds of political
parties in terms of votes. Well aware of the associations' role in
the December elections, Minister of Finance Yen Ching-chang and
Chairman Chen Hsi-huang of the Council of Agriculture in the past
weeks have visited executives of several farmers' associations in
Pingtung, Kaohsiung, and Tainan, hoping to resolve the differences
and to smooth over simmering resentment.</P>
      <P>The opposition parties, on the other hand, have sought to secure
votes through their old connections. Former agricultural officials of
the Kuomintang (KMT)-ruling era also increased contacts with their
old acquaintances at the farmers' associations.</P>
      <P>Wang Chih-wen, director of the Training Department of the
Republic of China Agricultural Training Association, said that the
farmers' associations would not make public their political
inclinations so that they will not offend the Council of Agriculture.
But they have shown strong resentment towards the finance ministry.</P>
      <P>Lin Cheng-huei, secretary-general of the Hsiulin Farmers'
Association in Changhwa County, said that they were most humiliated
when the authorities treated the farmers' associations as "thieves."</P>
      <P>Only a few weeks before the elections, the Council of Agriculture
is trying hard to win favor from the farmers' associations. Chairman
Chen has given his personal guarantee that the authorities will not
make another round of clean-up reforms on credit departments of the
farmers' association as had been rumored.</P>

      <P>The suspicious white powder found on a

      <P>The plane, flight No.605 carrying 359 passengers, took off from

powder on the carpeting of the floor of business class and alerted
Hong Kong police.</P>

checked every passenger. Experts were sent to check the suspicious
white powder to see if it was related to the anthrax which has caused

may be creamer for coffee, but will need further tests to confirm

    <HEADLINE>LEGISLATURE ENDORSES EXTENSION OF INSURANCE GUARANTEE FOR AIRLINES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  23  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan endorsed a Cabinet
proposal Tuesday to extend for two months the current government
guarantees for the island's airlines on insurance claims for
accidents caused by hijacking or war.</P>
      <P>According to the proposal, initiated by the Ministry of
Transportation and Communications (MOTC), the government's war-risk
insurance coverage guarantees for domestic carriers will remain valid
until midnight of Dec. 25 this year.</P>
      <P>MOTC officials said the ministry came up with the proposal mainly
because of the ongoing U.S.-led war on terrorism in retaliation for
the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in New York and Washington.</P>
      <P>With the escalation of the U.S. strikes on the Taliban in the
Central Asian state of Afghanistan -- MOTC officials said the
commercial aviation insurance market is not expected to return to
normal in the short term.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, the officials went on, the government's
war-risk insurance coverage guarantees for local airlines must be
extended for another two months to help domestic carriers weather the
difficulties.</P>
      <P>In the wake of the terrorist attacks on America, international
underwriters have raised aviation insurance premiums across the board
and have slashed the maximum third-party liability compensation to
US$50 million.</P>
      <P>The government's financial guarantee will give the nation's
airlines temporary coverage above that amount in the event of any
claims resulting from hijackings or war, while giving the companies
time to negotiate new contracts with insurance companies.</P>
      <P>The U.S. government and a number of other governments around the
world have already pledged to help their aviation industries through
their difficult times by providing similar financial aid packages.</P>
      <P>The Republic of China government first offered a 30-day war-risk
insurance coverage guarantee to domestic carriers on Sept. 26, which
will end Oct. 25.</P>
      <P>In addition to approving the two-month insurance guarantee
extension, the legislature also passed a proposal demanding that the
government allow airlines, particularly those which operate flight
services to European destinations, to apply to use mainland China's
airspace to avoid the Middle East war zone and save time and fuel
costs.</P>
      <P>The proposal was initiated by opposition New Party legislator
Elmer Feng, who headed a delegation of senior executives of six
Taiwan carriers to meet with mainland Chinese civil aviation
officials and industry executives earlier this month to explore the
possibility of Taiwan carriers flying over mainland airspace for
safety and cost-saving purposes amid the current U.S. strikes on
Afghanistan. According to Feng, mainland authorities would approve if
Taiwan carriers file applications.</P>
      <P>Officials with the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) said
flying over a country's airspace does not need negotiations. With the
host country's consent, a foreign commercial aircraft can fly over
its airspace.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, the ROC's existing regulations governing civilian
exchanges across the Taiwan Strait bans domestic carriers from flying
to mainland China.</P>
      <P>CAA officials said it's up to the Mainland Affairs Council, which
charts Taiwan's policy toward mainland China, to decide whether
Taiwan's commercial aircraft would be allowed to fly over mainland
China en route to Europe.</P>
      <P>Under pressure from the legislature, MOTC Minister Yeh Chu-lan
said domestic carriers can file applications for flying over mainland
airspace. "The Cabinet will decide the fate of those applications,"
she noted.</P>
      <P>Legislator Feng also admitted that although the legislature has
passed his proposal, he is not sure whether the proposal can be
implemented smoothly in the future.</P>
      <P>Both China Airlines (CAL) and EVA Airways, the two Taiwan
carriers that operate flight services to major European cities, said
even though they hope to fly to Europe via mainland China to save
time and fuel, they would not do so without the government's
approval.</P>
      <P>Since the U.S.-led forces began strikes on Afghanistan, CAL and
EVA have made detours to southern India, Saudi Arabia and the Red Sea
on the way to Europe. As a result, flights from Taipei to Europe will
take an additional 30 minutes, while the detour will cause a one-hour
increase in flight time on their way back.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  23  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Independent Legislator Lo Fu-chu took a
flight to Hong Kong Tuesday on a one-way ticket purchased at the
airport shortly before departure, according to sources at Chiang
Kai-shek International Airport.</P>
      <P>Lo's unexpected departure caused widespread allegations and
speculation in the Taipei political arena as the Taipei City Police
Headquarters was making a final decision on whether Lo should be
listed as a hooligan as had been requested by the Taipei Prosecutors'
Office earlier this month.</P>
      <P>Staff at Lo's office said his departure had nothing to do with
the police meeting, that Lo was going for a private business meeting
and that he would return to Taiwan in a couple of days.</P>
      <P>The Taipei Prosecutors' Office indicted Lo Oct. 8 for physically
assaulting Diane Lee, a legislator of the opposition People First
Party (PFP). The prosecutors also requested that Taipei City Police
Headquarters list Lo as a gangster, based on 14 charges.</P>
      <P>The Taipei City Police Headquarters convened a meeting last week
in which it excluded three of the 14 charges and resolved that an
eight-member ad hoc meeting would make a final decision on whether Lo
-- widely recognized as a thug because of his frequent assaults on
his colleagues at the Legislative Yuan -- should be listed as a
hooligan.</P>
      <P>Lo, who buckled under the pressure of public censure after the
Lee assault in March and gave himself a six-month suspension from
legislative activities, stirred up a new storm at the Legislative
Yuan in early October when he ranted and raved at members of the
Legislative Yuan Finance Committee who were discussing the rule
banning any lawmaker from chairing any committee for three sessions
in a row.</P>
      <P>The rule prevented Lo's son, Kuomintang Legislator Lo Ming-tsai,
from chairing the committee, as it would have been his third
consecutive session as convenor -- even though he was elected to the
position.</P>
      <P>Lo Ming-tsai filed for a constitutional interpretation Oct. 9 on
the justification of the Taipei Prosecutors' Office requesting his
father's listing as a hooligan.</P>
      <P>The junior Lo lambasted the prosecutors for "violating the
Republic of China Constitution." He called the move an act of
"judiciary white terror" and claimed the judicial system was
illegally intervening in the legislative system.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Oct.   23   (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>European countries should ease
"unreasonable" visa restrictions on high-ranking Republic of China
officials, a Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) official said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>MOFA spokeswoman Chang Siao-yue made the remark after Denmark and
France declined to issue visas to President Chen Shui-bian that would
have allowed him to receive in person a human rights award from the
Liberal International (LI).</P>
      <P>"European countries should drop all `unreasonable' constraints on
visa applications by our senior officials in line with the principles
of humanitarianism and justice," Chang said, adding that the ROC
deserves fair treatment in the international community.</P>
      <P>Chang said the MOFA is still endeavoring to pave the way for Chen
to somehow travel to Europe to receive the LI's 2001 Prize for
Freedom in person.</P>
      <P>"We hope that European countries will refrain from self-imposed
restrictions on senior ROC officials simply for fear of offending
mainland China," Chang said.</P>
      <P>She further said MOFA has no plans at the moment to send an envoy
to Europe to collect the award on Chen's behalf.</P>
      <P>In a recent interview with a Swiss newspaper, Chen complained
that Denmark had bowed to pressure from mainland China by refusing to
grant him a visa.</P>
      <P>"They awarded me the Prize for Freedom, but they took away my
freedom to travel," he said.</P>
      <P>Foreign wire service reports quoted LI Secretary-General Jan
Weijers as having said that the organization's attempts to arrange
another venue for Chen to receive the award had been thwarted by what
he claimed is a European Union policy under which Taiwan's top five
leaders are denied visas -- even for private visits.</P>
      <P>However, Chang pointed out that former Hong Kong Governor Chris
Patten, who is now a member of the European Commission, the executive
arm of the 15-member European Union, said in May this year that there
is no official EU policy of denying entry permits to senior Taiwan
officials.</P>
      <P>"That a democratically elected president cannot travel to Europe
to receive a human rights award -- our view is that this is totally
cynical," Weijers said from LI's headquarters in London.</P>
      <P>LI, an alliance of more than 80 liberal political parties from
more than 60 countries, commended Chen for his "solid record as a
human rights activist" and his contributions to democracy on the
island.</P>
      <P>Chen, a former human rights lawyer, defended an opposition leader
who narrowly escaped the death penalty at a sedition trial in 1980
for organizing a demonstration in defiance of a now-scrapped ban on
street protests.</P>
      <P>Chen went on to become a member of the Legislative Yuan and the
mayor of Taipei. He swept to power in presidential elections in March
2000, ending more than five decades of one-party rule.</P>
      <P>Previous winners of the LI's Prize for Freedom include Burmese
opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi, Algerian women's rights

    <HEADLINE>CABINET OPPOSES PROPOSED DIRECT TRAVEL TO MAINLAND CHINA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  23  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Government officials expressed concern
Tuesday about a proposal to allow direct travel from Taiwan proper to
mainland China via the offshore islands of Kinmen and Matsu, saying
it would strain the defense and social order of the offshore islands.</P>
      <P>They were responding to questions raised by opposition
legislators Chao Erh-chung and Lin Ping-kun during a general
interpellation session in the Legislative Yuan. Both asked the
officials to express their views on the revised bills governing
construction on the offshore islands, which recently passed its first
reading.</P>
      <P>The revised bill also makes provisions for the establishment of
casinos on the offshore island of Penghu and tax exemptions for the
offshore islands to help stimulate the economy and aid development.</P>
      <P>Chao, who hails from Kinmen and Lin, who is from Penghu are both
opposition Kuomintang lawmakers and have promoted the revision of the
bills in the belief that the opening of direct trade, postal and
transport links between Kinmen and Matsu and mainland China should be
wider.</P>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung said the Cabinet hopes the opening of
links between the two sides of the Taiwan strait will be conducted in
a "safe, orderly and gradual way," but if Beijing is unwilling to
consult with Taipei on related matters, it will be hard to expect
"orderly and massive cross-strait exchanges."</P>
      <P>Chang said that if Taiwan people were to be allowed to travel to
mainland China directly through Kinmen and Matsu, it would put a
strain on defense and social order on the islands.</P>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen also said that if Taiwan
people could travel to the mainland freely through Kinmen and Matsu,
it would have a tremendous impact on national security.</P>
      <P>As Beijing would not consult with Taipei on related matters, and
as wharf facilities are lacking in Kinmen and Matsu, Tsai said she
was opposed to such an opening, adding that Kinmen and Matsu also
have no capacity to check on the inflow and outflow of visitors.</P>
      <P>Tsai also said that the MAC will review a further opening of the
"three mini links" -- which were started on a trial basis this year
-- by the end of the year.</P>
      <P>The MAC will review whether to let Taiwan businessmen and
executives based in the mainland's Fujian Province travel to Taiwan
via Kinmen and Matsu, according to legislator Lin Chung-cheng, who
first made the proposal.</P>
      <P>Ministry of Justice Chen Ding-nan also stated categorically that
the ministry is opposed to the establishment of casinos on the
offshore islands.</P>
      <P>Chen Po-chih, chairman of the Council for Economic Planning and
Development, echoed Chen's words, saying that one has to consider the
negative effect of casinos, claiming that there are cases in other
countries where the opening of casinos has turned the casino areas
into drug trafficking centers.</P>
      <P>On the subject of tax breaks, Finance Minister Yen Ching-chang
said that he has reservations about proposed duty-free and tax
exemption measures for the offshore islands, while Economic Affairs
Minister Lin Hsin-yi also said that if the offshore islands are
allowed to import goods duty free and the goods are brought back to
Taiwan proper, it will affect Taiwan's industrial development.</P>

      <P>Formosan macaques have caused heavy

    <HEADLINE>FORMER MAC CHIEF DEFENDS SO-CALLED `1992 CROSS-STRAIT CONSENSUS'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  23  (CNA)
(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Mainland Affairs Council (MAC)
Chairman Su Chi said Tuesday that the so-called "1992 consensus" said
by some to have been reached by Taiwan and mainland China has formed
an "important political basis" for the development of cross-Taiwan
Strait relations in the past decade.</P>
      <P>Without the consensus, he claimed, there would have been no
cross-strait reconciliation between 1992-1995, including the 1993
Singapore talks between Straits Exchange Foundation Chairman Koo
Chen-fu and Chairman Wang Daohan of Beijing's Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Su, who was in charge of Taiwan's relations with mainland China
under former President Lee Teng-hui, said that the consensus
prevented direct collision between Taipei and Beijing and brought a
win-win result for both sides.</P>
      <P>Regarding remarks by Lee that day that there never was any "1992
consensus," Su said that today's Lee is different from the Lee of the
past.</P>
      <P>According to Su, the existence of the "1992 consensus" and the
"one China with respective interpretations" are "facts" which have
been admitted by Koo, former Premier Vincent Siew and Lee himself.</P>
      <P>Su speculated that the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
and the newly formed Taiwan Solidarity Union, which regards Lee as
its spiritual leader, dislike "one China with respective
interpretations" because they think "one China" implies that Taiwan
is part of China.</P>
      <P>Chen and the DPP have recently described "one country, two
systems," "one China with respective interpretations" and the "one
China principle" as schemes designed to "destroy the Republic of
China and sell out Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Su said that such a view destroys the basis for the development
of cross-strait relations and further hinders the resumption of
bilateral dialogue which has been stalled since the second half of
1999.</P>
      <P>He said that he hopes the remarks were only "election campaign
language" or an unintentional slip of the tongue on Chen's part and
that Chen will not insist on such a view after the Dec. 1 elections.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC PLANS TO IMPORT INDIAN SOFTWARE TALENT, TRAINING MECHANISM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  23 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan plans to open its door to computer
software programmers from India to help ease a manpower shortage in
the local information-technology (IT) industry, a senior official
said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Minister-without-Portfolio Tsai Ching-yen, also a joint convener
of the Science and Technology Advisory Group (STAG) under the
Executive Yuan, said Taiwan should also consider importing software
educational and training mechanism from India to help boost the
domestic software industry development.</P>
      <P>Tsai said the STAG invited software industry representatives,
senior executives of IT industry associations and scholars to discuss
feasible measures to resolve the software manpower shortage problem.</P>
      <P>"All the participants reached a consensus that we should
introduce software talent and training system from India," Tsai
said.</P>
      <P>Noting that India is known for its software technology, Tsai
said the South Asian country accounts for 20 percent of the world's
software OED (original equipment designing) market. Indian software
firms offer services to 200 of the world's top 1,000 corporations,
according to Tsai.</P>
      <P>"Among the world's 23 software companies which receive the
top-grade certification in terms of the U.S.-developed Level Software
Engineer Institute Capability Maturity Model," Tsai said, "15 are
Indian firms."</P>
      <P>As India can cultivate 75,000 outstanding software engineers,
Tsai said, many countries around the world have actively recruited
talent from that countries.</P>
      <P>"The United States and Germany have even revised their domestic
laws to facilitate imports of Indian software talent," Tsai said,
adding that Japan, Belgium, Singapore and Ireland have also adopted
various measures to recruit qualified Indian software engineers or
programmers.</P>
      <P>Noting that India is also known for its software educational and
training mechanism, Tsai said Japan and mainland China have
forged cooperative ties with India's largest software training
institution.</P>
      <P>In comparison, Tsai said, Taiwan has lagged behind in
introducing India software talent and training system.</P>
      <P>"The STAG will invite officials of relevant government agencies
in the near future to discuss a comprehensive plan to introduce
Indian software engineers and training mechanism into Taiwan," Tsai
added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC LEGISLATURE OK'S TAIWAN FLIGHT DETOURS OVER MAINLAND CHINA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 23 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China legislature resolved
Tuesday to allow Taiwan air carriers to fly through mainland Chinese
airspace rather than over India and Afghanistan on their way to
Europe, in light of the U.S. military action in Afghanistan.</P>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan passed a non-binding resolution requesting
the Cabinet to permit Taiwan airlines to negotiate with mainland
Chinese authorities over the possibility of Taiwan aircraft flying to
Europe via mainland China rather than over India and Afghanistan.</P>
      <P>However, Minister of Transportation and Communications Yeh
Chu-lan said local carriers will remain prohibited from using
mainland Chinese airspace unless Beijing agrees to discuss the issue
with ROC government officials.</P>
      <P>Officials from the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC)
said the council will give all possible and pragmatic routes
considerations on the premise that the ROC's national interests are
fully secured.</P>
      <P>In a written statement, the MAC said the agency will pay close
attention to the development of related situations and would like to
assess different possible routes for the domestic airlines to choose
from under the consideration of national interests.</P>
      <P>Yeh said current ROC laws forbid Taiwan aircraft, vessels or
other vehicles from flying, sailing, or passing through mainland
Chinese airspace, territory, or waters without ROC permission and the
mandate to waive these prohibitions rests not with his ministry but
with the MAC and the Executive Yuan.</P>
      <P>Taiwan air carriers' requests to fly through mainland Chinese
airspace on their way to Europe to save costs involve the Taiwan
government's power to regulate aviation rights and cannot be granted
by anyone other than the government, Yen added.</P>
      <P>She also continued that the government will not accede to such
requests unless it can first consult with Beijing. Beijing has
consistently refused to consult with the Democratic Progressive
Party-led government.</P>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan made the non-binding resolution as the
International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) was set to recommend
to its members that they fly from East Asia to Europe via mainland
China rather than over India and Afghanistan in light of the U.S.
military actions against the Taliban in Afghanistan.</P>
      <P>ICAO authorities were quoted as saying last week that one-third
of the flights between Asia and Europe are routed via Southeast Asia,
the Bay of Bengal, India, Afghanistan and the Middle East.</P>
      <P>But business on this route was dealt a serious blow after the
United States launched strikes on the Taliban regime Oct. 8.</P>
      <P>As a result, the ICAO began mulling whether to divert the route
to the four mainland Chinese flight information zones of Kunming,
Chengdu, Lanzhou and Urumqi before flying over Siberia into Europe.</P>
      <P>About 2,600 km of this route is in mainland Chinese airspace,
over mainly highland, desert and mountain ranges.</P>
      <P>Only flights by Hong Kong-based Cathay Pacific Airways take this
route to Europe thus far, according to the ICAO.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is not a member of the ICAO and was not informed of its
recommendations for the detour plan. However, Beijing air traffic
authorities promised Oct. 12 to open the route to Taiwan carriers
should they apply to use it.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Scholars at a symposium
Tuesday that Taiwan's withdrawal from the informal summit of the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum over the weekend is
unfavorable for the island.</P>
      <P>The symposium was sponsored by the International Research
Institute of Tamkang University to o analyze the post-APEC forum
summit U.S.-Taiwan relations and cross-Taiwan Strait relations.</P>
      <P>The participants agreed that Taiwan's absence from the APEC
informal leadership summit meant that Taiwan walked off the
international and economic stage and will only have an advantage for
those politicians who place their personal gain above public
interest, while representing a disadvantage for Taiwan's future.</P>
      <P>The symposium was jointly presided over by Wei Eh, dean of the
International Research Institute and Yu Chuan-tao, ex-president of
the Central Police University, and more than 30 local scholars
participated.</P>
      <P>According to Wei, the relationship between Washington and Beijing
has become closer since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on Washington
and New York, while Washington-Taipei ties are shrinking daily.
Taiwan, he claimed, has "lost important bargaining chips" and this
situation is very unfavorable for the island.</P>
      <P>Prof. Lee Peng-ching of Tamkang University claimed that many
people in Taiwan have failed to identify themselves as Chinese and
that "indigenization" is on the rise in Taiwan. Under such
circumstances, he went on, dialogue may not be able to resolve the
cross-strait problem and Beijing may eventually resort to force to
resolve the Taiwan issue.</P>

arms purchase scandal 10 years ago.

    <HEADLINE>LEGENDARY GENERAL CHANG HSUEH-LIANG LAID TO REST</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>San  Francisco,  Oct.  23  (CNA)
(By Neil Lu and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Chang Hsueh-liang, a legendary
former warlord who played a historic role in the turbulent China of
the 1930s, was laid to rest Tuesday in Hawaii.</P>
      <P>A Christian memorial service was held at a funeral parlor in
Honolulu early in the morning, with the participation of Republic of
China Foreign Minister Tien Hung-mao as well as Chang's family and
friends.</P>
      <P>Tien attended the ceremony on behalf of the ROC
government and President Chen Shui-bian who also asked Tien to bestow
a posthumous citation on Chang in recognition of his contributions to
the country.</P>
      <P>Chen and many other senior ROC officials and prominent political
figures, including Vice President Annette Lu, Premier Chang
Chun-hsiung, opposition Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan and former
Premier Hau Pei-tsun, sent wreaths to express their respect for
Chang.</P>
      <P>Former ROC first lady Madame Chiang Kai-shek, who has led a
reclusive life in New York since her husband died in 1975, named
Cecilia Yen, secretary-general of the National Women's League of the
ROC, to represent her at Chang's funeral. Moreover, Madame Chiang
sent a cross of flowers to express her condolences.</P>
      <P>Mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin and a number of other
elder mainland politicians also sent flower baskets to pay tribute to
Chang. He Yafei, minister of the mainland Chinese embassy in the
United States, made a brief appearance at the funeral parlor to pay
his respects to Chang, but he left before the memorial service began.</P>
      <P>The presence of representatives and the messages of condolence
from both sides of the Taiwan Strait indicated Chang's special status
in modern Chinese history.</P>
      <P>Chang, also known as "young marshal," died Oct. 15 at a hospital
in Honolulu at the age of 101.</P>
      <P>The "young marshal" succeeded his father -- a warlord who
dominated northeastern China after the Republic of China was founded
in 1911 -- as leader of his father's militia, called the Northeastern
army, in his early 20s.</P>
      <P>In order to integrate the Northeastern army into the forces of
the Nationalist government, Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, who led
the Nationalists at the time, named Chang as the commander in chief
of the Nationalist army in northeastern China in 1926.</P>
      <P>However, Chang and his followers were expelled from their
stronghold when Japanese Imperial forces invaded China in 1931 and
occupied northeastern China. Chang, who was eager to drive the
Japanese out of the region, was at odds with Chiang, who wanted to
use Chang's army to fight against the burgeoning Chinese Communists.</P>
      <P>Chang took Chiang hostage in Xian Dec. 12, 1936 in an attempt to
force him to join forces with the Communists to fight the Japanese.</P>
      <P>Chang was persuaded by Chiang to give up his attempt and submit
himself to the Nanking-based Nationalist government for discipline.
Chang escorted Chiang to Nanking two weeks later, ending the
so-called Xian Incident.</P>
      <P>Chang was then put under house arrest for nearly half a century
after moving to Taiwan along with the ROC government in 1949.</P>
      <P>He was granted relative freedom of movement on the island in 1988
by then-President Lee Teng-hui and was allowed to move to Honolulu in
1993.</P>
      <P>The citation bestowed by President Chen hails Chang as a
patriotic figure who pledged allegiance to the Nationalist government
despite the Japanese threat and contributed significantly to the
unification of the country.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN TO LOWER TARIFFS ON OVER 3,400 INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  24 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>With its impending accession to the World
Trade Organization (TWO), Taiwan decided to slash tariffs on
industrial products to the trade-weighted average of 5.78 percent in
the first year of accession, the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA)
reported Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Officials from the MOEA's Industrial Development Bureau (IDB)
said industrial tariffs, affecting 3,470 categories of products, will
be lowered from the current 6.03 percent to 5.78 percent in the first
year of Taiwan's WTO membership and eventually down to 4.15 percent
in 2004 when the tariff-cut move is completed.</P>
      <P>Over the three-year period, tariffs on Taiwan's industrial
products are expected to be slashed by 31.18 percent on a
year-on-year basis, IDB officials noted.</P>
      <P>The officials said the cross-the-board industrial tariff cut is
not expected to have a major impact on most areas of Taiwan's
industrial sector, except for on those relying heavily on the
domestic market to survive, including the household electrical
appliance manufacturing, automobile and tire manufacturing, heavy
electrical machinery manufacturing and paper making industry.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the officials said, the Republic of China government
has been soliciting support from various WTO member countries for
Taiwan's proposal to allow for the continued imposition of quota
restrictions after Taiwan enters the WTO in order to protect the
island's fragile compact car manufacturing sector.</P>
      <P>Compact car imports which meet the quota will have a tariff rate
of 30 percent in the first year, with the rate being gradually
lowered to 17.5 percent by the ninth year of Taiwan's WTO membership,
the officials continued.</P>
      <P>Taiwan will become a full member of the WTO 30 days after Nov. 10
if the Legislative Yuan convenes a special session to give its stamp
of approval, a ranking MOEA official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Quoting WTO Director-General Mike Moore, the official said the
fourth WTO ministerial meeting will be held in the Gulf state of
Qatar from Nov. 9-13 as originally scheduled, during which the WTO is
expected to formally endorse mainland China and Taiwan's accession
terms.</P>
      <P>Mainland China's accession terms are expected to be endorsed Nov.
10, and Beijing's National People's Congress will convene an
extraordinary session on the same day to ratify the mainland entry
protocol for immediate delivery to the WTO secretariat.</P>
      <P>Under current WTO regulations, an applicant's membership bid will
take effect 30 days after its accession protocol is sent to the
Secretariat of the Geneva-based world trade regulatory body.</P>
      <P>The WTO has agreed in principle to simultaneously approve the
accession protocols of the two sides of the Taiwan Strait. The ROC's
Legislature, however, will be in recess when the WTO passes the
island's accession protocol Nov. 10.</P>
      <P>"We hope the Legislative Yuan can convene a special session that
day to ratify the protocol lest Taiwan lag behind mainland China,"
the official said, adding that if mainland China enters the WTO
before Taiwan, it may try to bar Taiwan's accession using the excuse
of Taiwan's restrictions on direct cross-strait trade and
transportation links.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP LAUNCHES NEW MAGAZINE ON INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  24 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China's ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) launched a new magazine Wednesday to signify
its concern about international affairs and implementation of the
island's diplomatic policy.</P>
      <P>DPP Secretary-General Wu Nai-jen told a news conference that the
new International Affairs Quarterly will focus on policy research,
particularly on subjects closely related to Taiwan's foreign policy.</P>
      <P>"General international relations, the global economy, the current
international situation and strategic security will be the major
topics to be addressed," Wu explained, adding that the new magazine
is expected to offer feasible initiatives for the formation and
implementation of Taiwan's foreign policy.</P>
      <P>In the face of mainland China's perennial squeeze on Taiwan's
presence in the international arena, Wu said Taiwan cannot afford to
make any mistakes in its diplomatic work.</P>
      <P>"Our policymakers must keep abreast of the latest international
situation and prudently evaluate every possible impact of various
policy proposals before formulating a strategy to cope with major
diplomatic events and defend Taiwan's interests," Wu said.</P>
      <P>He added that the government must make an overall review of two
recent incidents -- Beijing's refusal of Taiwan's representative to
attend this year's informal leadership summit of the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation forum in Shanghai over the weekend, and
President Chen Shui-bian's inability to obtain visas to travel to
Europe to receive the 2001 Prize for Freedom awarded by the Liberal
International, a London-based alliance of more than 80 liberal
political parties in 60 countries around the world.</P>
      <P>Noting that the wave of globalization has diminished national
boundaries, Wu said the DPP has made active, pragmatic adjustments of
its policy platform to enable Taiwan to better adapt itself to the
new international climate characterized by emphasis on democracy,
human rights and freedom.</P>
      <P>Wu was referring to a decision made at the DPP's party congress
Saturday that elevates a 1999 resolution on Taiwan's future to the
same level as the "Taiwan independence clause" of the DPP's charter.
It was an important step in the DPP's history and a new
interpretation of the party's pro-independence platform. From now on,
whenever the two come into conflict, the 1999 resolution, which
recognizes the existence of the Republic of China, will take
precedence over the party charter's independence clause.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Wu pointed out that all the adjustments will not
weaken the DPP's insistence on its basic value -- "Taiwan first," or
"Taiwan's national interests take precedence over anything else."</P>
      <P>"In the new century," Wu said, "Taiwan should play the role of an
active participant in international affairs to defend the mainstream
values of the global society."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, DPP Chairman Frank Hsieh said in the inaugural issue
of the International Affairs Quarterly that the new publication
pools resources of the academic community, think tanks,
political parties, news media and government agencies to
provide a forum for foreign policy discussion and encourage
research in international affairs for government reference.</P>
      <P>In view of increasing commercial and civilian exchanges acros
the Taiwan Strait, Hsieh said Taiwan must cash in on the
opportunities provided by imminent simultaneous entry of Taipei and
Beijing to the World Trade Orgnization (WTO) to integrate
resources of both sides and develop itself into a major base for
multinational companies to tap the vast mainland Chinese market.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHEN URGES TAIWAN INDUSTRIES TO EVOLVE TO SURVIVE NEW CHALLENGES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Pingtung,  Oct.  24  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian on Wednesday
exhorted Taiwan industries to evolve and change qualitatively in
order to survive the challenges posed by an increasingly competitive
world market.</P>
      <P>Chen said that the question of how Taiwan will succeed in the
transitional struggle in the 21st century depends on how well the
country will face the new international situation, adding that the
industrial sector, the backbone of Taiwan's economic growth, should
strive to readjust itself to meet the new challenges.</P>
      <P>Addressing a ceremony marking the ground-breaking of a
second-generation export processing zone (EPZ) in Taiwan's
southernmost county of Pingtung, Chen said Taiwan is presently facing
at least three major challenges with the beginning of the era of the
globalized economy.</P>
      <P>First, he said, Taiwan is facing a challenge posed by mainland
China, which is undertaking an unprecedented transition from an
economic backwater to a key player in global economic development.</P>
      <P>The president noted that Taiwan must find its direction soon in
this turbulent current of transition, as well as utilize its
geographical, cultural, and technological advantages in seeking
further and sustainable development.</P>
      <P>Second, Chen said, with Taiwan's and mainland China's impending
WTO accession, Taiwan faces the challenge of how to adjust its
economy in order to allow itself to be placed in an advantageous
position for competition in the global economy.</P>
      <P>Third, Taiwan faces the challenge of how to make biotech-led high
technology development the basis of its economic development in the
following decade, he continued.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chen highly credited the contributions of EPZs to
Taiwan's economic progress over the past decades, pointing out that
the new-generation EPZs, like the one which is going to be developed
in Pingtung County, will be new global operations centers for the
industrial and business sectors, and not simply manufacturing
complexes for exports.</P>
      <P>The planned Pingtung Export Processing Zone, which will include
the high-added-value electronics and information technology, biotech,
aeronautics, agricultural machinery and automobile industries, is
expected to attract some NT$60 billion (US$1.74 billion) worth of
investment to the area, Chen said.</P>
      <P>In addition, he noted, the Pingtung Export Processing Zone will
be a multipurpose operational center combining manufacturing as well
as sea, land and air transport operations, and providing swift and
convenient services to domestic and international manufacturers and
dealers.</P>
      <P>The 124-hectare export processing zone is expected to create some
45,000 job opportunities when it is completed, making Pingtung County
a new industrial and business hub in southern Taiwan, Chen said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GROUP OF ABORIGINAL ELDERS QUESTIONED OVER VOTE-BUYING SUSPICIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Nantou,  central  Taiwan,  Oct.  24  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of elderly
aboriginal tourists aboard a bus home after taking a leisure trip to
Japan's Okinawa Prefecture were taken to a Nantou County
investigation station Tuesday night for questioning, local sources
reported Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The members of the group, all from the aboriginal village of
Chunyang in Nantou County's Jenai Township, were "intercepted" by an
army of prosecutors and police officers near Tsaotun Township around
12 p.m. Tuesday during their trip home.</P>
      <P>The group, including 33 tribal elders and their travel leader Lin
Hsiao-ying, were brought to the station for questioning, mainly on
suspicions of their being "treated" by legislative candidates in the
Dec. 1 island-wide elections.</P>
      <P>The elderly men and women were not allowed to go home until 5
a.m. Wednesday after each of them had been questioned about the
alleged vote-buying and bribery.</P>
      <P>Nantou prosecutors said they made the move to take the group in
for questioning after they were tipped off that the elders may have
been involved in a suspected vote-buying deal by joining the tour
group to Okinawa several days ago.</P>
      <P>The seniors were provided with interpreters and a medical doctor
during the questioning session, the prosecutors said.</P>
      <P>All 33 elders were let go after 5 a.m. without any conditions,
while the group leader Lin Hsiao-ying was released on NT$10,000 bail.</P>
      <P>While the elders denied receiving any gifts from any election
candidates, the presiding Nantou prosecutor, Hsu Sung-kuei, argued
that the prosecutors possess some evidence that indicates vote-buying
laws were violated which will necessitate further investigation
before any alleged violators are indicted.</P>
      <P>Both Premier Chang Chun-hsiung and Justice Minister Chen Ding-nan
have vowed to eradicate vote-buying from the year-end elections for
legislators, county chiefs and city mayors, thereby directly
accelerating the sweeping actions of law enforcement authorities at
all levels islandwide as the day of the elections approaches.</P>
      <P>Justice Minister Chen Ding-nan earlier this month defended the
NT$30 (US$0.87) standard for vote-buying violations, saying that the
decision will not be altered despite widespread criticism.</P>
      <P>Chen stressed that the decision, which has been ridiculed by some
politicians and elected representatives as unrealistic, will not be
changed as the government is determined to stamp out in this year's
elections that which has become commonplace in Taiwan politics --
gifts of money or goods in exchange for votes.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GOV'T WORKING TO MAKE TAIWAN FREE OF FOOT AND MOUTH DISEASE BY 2007</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  24  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A legislator of the opposition New Party
said Wednesday that the government hopes to make Taiwan free from the
threat of foot and mouth disease (FMD) by 2007.</P>
      <P>Legislator Chang Shih-liang said that the Executive Yuan has set
up a task force to eradicate FMD in three stages, with the
implementation of nationwide vaccinations by the end of 2005
occurring during the first stage.</P>
      <P>During the second stage, the government will be on high alert in
order to prevent even a single case of FMD from occurring in 2006.</P>
      <P>In the third stage, the government will declare Taiwan an
FMD-free zone and ask international authorities to confirm the
results.</P>
      <P>Chang noted that in recent years, domestic hog, cattle and sheep
farmers and their meat exporters have lost billions of NT dollars
every year due to FMD.</P>
      <P>He said that although the Executive Yuan plans to achieve the
goal of an FMD-free Taiwan by 2007, the goal can be achieved two
years earlier if the Executive Yuan can rigorously implement the
vaccination and prevention measures and if farmers cooperate with the
government.</P>
      <P>The FMD epidemic, which ravaged hog farms islandwide in March
1997, caused losses estimated at NT$43.9 billion (1.26 billion) for
Taiwan's hog-raising industry. After the FMD outbreak among hogs,
cases of cattle being infected with FMD were also reported.</P>
      <P>The annual production value of Taiwan's hog-raising industry
dropped from NT$88.6 billion in 1996 to NT$44.7 billion in 1997.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BLOCKING OF TAIWAN'S PRESENCE AT APEC SUMMIT HARMFUL: ROC OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 24 (CNA)
(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Vice Foreign Minister Wu
Tzu-dan said in a report Wednesday that Beijing's "blocking" of
Taiwan's participation in the leadership conference of the Asia
Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum was harmful to the
development of cross-Taiwan Strait relations.</P>
      <P>In the report presented to the Legislative Yuan, Wu said that
because of the incident, cross-strait tensions will not be relaxed in
the short term.</P>
      <P>He continued: "It will not only worsen the situation across the
Taiwan Strait, but has also hurt the feelings of the Taiwan people
and has affected any possibility of a resumption of cross-strait
dialogue."</P>
      <P>Commenting on the summit talks between U.S. President George Bush
and mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin, Wu said that their talks
have not caused any negative effects on Taiwan's interests.</P>
      <P>He noted that Bush only reiterated that the U.S. government would
continue to observe the "one China" policy, would like to see a
peaceful solution to the Taiwan Strait issue, would honor the Taiwan
Relations Act and the three joint statements signed between the
United States and mainland China.</P>
      <P>Therefore, Wu went on, mainland China made no gains in terms of
the Taiwan Strait issue during the talks and he added that it also
reflected a U.S. promise made to Taipei before the talks that Taiwan
interests would not be sacrificed.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Wu told legislators that mainland Chinese Foreign
Minister Tang Jiaxuan's actions were "incredible" when he stopped a
Taiwan reporter from using the term "Chung Kung" (communist China) to
refer to mainland China at a recent APEC news conference in Shanghai.</P>
      <P>According to Tang, the term has not been used for a long time,
but Wu pointed out that "Chung Kung" is a common abbreviated term for
"the Chinese Communist Party" or "the People's Republic of China."</P>
      <P>On Taiwan's absence from the APEC informal leadership conference
this year, Wu said that "it was a special case, not a precedent."</P>
      <P>Taiwan was forced to abstain from attending the leadership
meeting because Beijing rejected ROC President Chen Shui-bian's
appointment of former Vice President Li Yuan-zu to represent him at
the conference.</P>
      <P>Taipei also criticized Beijing for failing to follow APEC
protocol by refusing to send an official to Taipei to deliver the
invitation for the leadership conference.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei, Oct. 24 (CAN) In light of sharp falls in Taiwan's exports
and imports this year, the Economic Affairs Ministry (MOEA) will take
measures to help boost exports to various key markets less affected
by the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in the United States.</P>
      <P>In cooperation with the Board of Foreign Trade and the
semi-official China External Trade Development Council (CETRA), the
MOEA has set its sights on Japan, Southeast Asia, South Korea and
Europe, as well as Central and South America, for Taiwan's outbound
shipments to offset the decline in demand from the U.S. market in the
wake of the terror attack.</P>
      <P>A CETRA official said that from November, a total of 156
delegations will take part in trade fairs or will sponsor investment
seminars in countries in the targeted regions, while CETRA will also
dispatch 34 trade-promotion missions to the United States -- Taiwan's

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei needs to negotiate with Beijing on
the issue about flights by Taiwan-based aviation companies through
the airspace of mainland China, Transportation and Communications
Minister Yeh Chu-lan was quoted as saying Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Government Information Office Director-General Su Tzen-ping
quoted Yeh as saying at a news conference following a Cabinet meeting
that the issue needs to be discussed by the governments or official
authorities on the two sides, as Taiwan has not inked any aviation
agreement with mainland China.</P>
      <P>The legislature approved a non-binding resolution a day earlier
demanding that the government permit applications by Taiwan-based
carriers to fly over the airspace of mainland China en route to
Europe in the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks against the
United States.</P>
      <P>Following the attacks last month, the International Civil
Aviation Organization proposed that aviation companies use the "L888"
route through the airspace of mainalnd China for their flights to
Europe, rather than the usual route that overflys South Asia.</P>
      <P>Vice Transportation and Communications Minister Chang Chia-chu
said national carriers can apply for the L888 route if they think it
is necessary.</P>
      <P>But he pointed out that his ministry will be able to handle
relevant matters only after the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) agrees
that such flights will not violate the Statute Governing the
Relations Between the People of the Taiwan Area and the Mainland
Area.</P>
      <P>According to the law, airplanes of Taiwan-based aviation
companies are not allowed to fly over the mainland, Chang said,
adding, however, that it is up to the MAC to decide whether such
flights are illegal under the current circumstances.</P>
      <P>Chang noted that his ministry will help local carriers resolve
technical problems regarding the issue after the MAC -- the top
government agency in charge of charting Taiwan's policy toward
mainland China -- gives the nod and clarifies whether negotiations
with Beijing are mandatory.</P>

(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The chairman of the Cabinet-level Research,
Development and Evaluation Commission (RDEC) said Wednesday that an
ad hoc task force on government reform to be headed by the president
will focus initially on the slimming down of government agencies.</P>
      <P>Lin Chia-cheng said while reporting to the Legislative Yuan's
Organic Laws Committee that the RDEC has already established the goal
of cutting one-third of the existing government ministries and
agencies so that only 21 will remain after the first phase of the
massive government streamlining project is completed.</P>
      <P>Lin said that four other special organs, including the Central
Bank of China and the National Palace Museum, will remain intact, but
he added that it is too early to tell how many government employees
will be downsized in the restructuring.</P>
      <P>A draft amendment to the Organic Law of the Executive Yuan will
be completed by the RDEC in March, with a Cabinet-approved version to
be delivered to the Legislative Yuan for deliberation and
ratification by the end of April 2002, he added.</P>
      <P>Lin said that the provisional Government Restructuring Committee
will be formally established Wednesday with President Chen Shui-bian
at its head because "only the president has the authority to
coordinate the five yuans."</P>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung, who heads the Executive Yuan, and
Examination Yuan President Hsu Shui-teh will serve on the committee

    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  Oct.  24  (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Kaohsiung city government held a
ground-breaking ceremony attended by President Chen Shui-bian
Wednesday for the southern Taiwan city's first mass rapid transit
(MRT) system.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung City Mayor Frank Hsieh noted at the ceremony that while
the MRT system for Kaohsiung has been in the planning stages since
1990, construction has never been started, which has negatively
affected the development and employment rates of Kaohsiung and
southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Fortunately, he added, the Kaohsiung City Council passed the
budget for the MRT system two years ago, so that together with the
big support provided by the central government, Kaohsiung City
finally will have its own MRT system.</P>
      <P>Also speaking at the ceremony, Chen said that the Kaohsiung MRT
system should be attributed to Hsieh's efforts and Kaohsiung city
council's passing of the budget.</P>
      <P>He added that he envisages a bright future for Kaohsiung after
the completion of the MRT system.</P>
      <P>The system is designed to integrate high-speed and regular
railway and city bus systems, providing a comprehensive mass
transportation network, according to Hsieh.</P>
      <P>Wednesday's ceremony was to mark the start of construction of the
system's red and orange lines, which are estimated to cost NT$170
billion (US$5 billion), while other lines are also being planned.</P>
      <P>Construction of the red and orange lines, to be conducted by a
Taiwanese engineering company and a Japanese engineering company, is
expected to be completed in three years and four months.</P>
      <P>The red line will span a length of 28.3 kilometers with 23
stations, while the orange line will have a length of 14.4 kilometers
with 14 stations.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER CALLS FOR INTER-PARTY COOPERATION AT RETROCESSION DAY RALLY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Nantou,  Taiwan,  Oct.  25  (CNA)
(By  Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung on
Thursday urged all the major domestic political parties to promote
inter-party cooperation instead of confrontation in order to upgrade
Taiwan's national competitiveness.</P>
      <P>Chang made the appeal at a rally in Chunghsing Village in the
central Taiwan county of Nantou in celebration of the 56th
anniversary of the island's Retrocession Day.</P>
      <P>"Today marks the first Taiwan Retrocession Day in the 21st
century," Chang said, adding that he hopes major domestic political
parties refrain from partisan wrangling and work together to sustain
Taiwan's economic growth.</P>
      <P>Chang said although Taiwan has made admirable achievements in
economic development and political democratization in the past half
century, it has yet to forge a viable or mature mechanism for
constructive inter-party engagements due to more than five decades of
one-party rule.</P>
      <P>Noting that the island's first-ever transition of power between
different political parties in May 2000 ushered in a new era in
Taiwan's political history, Chang said political parties can compete
for taking the helm of the nation.</P>
      <P>"Nevertheless, all parties should cooperate in addressing issues
related to economic development, foreign relations and other subjects
that concern overall national interests," Chang said, adding that all
domestic parties should "feather nests" instead of "erect walls"
among them in order to enhance communication and mutual trust.</P>
      <P>Chang went on to say that Taiwan used to be known as "Ilha
Formosa," or a "beautiful island," but over exploitation of land and
water resources over the past five decades has damaged its ecological
system and natural environment.</P>
      <P>"A spate of disasters caused by landslides or mudslides signal a
`protest' by Mother Nature," Chang said, adding that "we must do some
soul searching while working on various post-disaster rehabilitation
programs, and we should devote more energy to reforestation work."</P>
      <P>On the economic front, Chang admitted that Taiwan's economy is
not in good shape. "Amid a lingering global economic slowdown," the
premier said, "our economy has taken a serious downturn and the
unemployment rate has continued to rise."</P>
      <P>In this time of economic hardship, Chang said, the people of
Taiwan should not lose confidence in the government's determination
to rev up the sluggish economy. "The government will continue to
increase public investment to create new job openings and make every
possible effort to improve the investment climate," he pledged.</P>
      <P>Touching on the upcoming elections for legislators, city mayors
and county magistrates, Chang said the Dec. 1 elections are critical
to Taiwan's political reform.</P>
      <P>"Law enforcement authorities will step up their crackdown on
vote-buying and organized crime in the run-up to the elections,"
Chang said, adding that the government will spare no efforts in
ensuring that the first elections following last year's transfer of
power from the Kuomintang to the Democratic Progressive Party are
clean, fair, just and violence-free.</P>
      <P>Retrocession Day marks the restoration of Taiwan to Chinese rule
on Oct. 25, 1945, after half a century of Japanese occupation.</P>

    <HEADLINE>"HONG KONG'S DREAM IS DYING" SAYS ASIAWEEK</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Hong  Kong,  Oct.  25(CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Hong Kong dream is dying, Asiaweek
executive editor Richard Hornik and correspondent Crystyl Mo wrote in
the latest issue of the weekly magazine.</P>
      <P>In an article on the latest woes that Hong Kong is facing, Hornik
and Mo said the negative equity scandal in the city is currently
eating away at the heart of its middle class, adding that the scandal
serves as yet another example of the constant parade of mini-crises
to hit Hong Kong since its reunification with mainland China in 1997.</P>
      <P>As many as 200,000 Hong Kong families now owe more on their
properties than they are presently worth, they wrote, adding that the
problem is more pervasive than a lousy real estate market. It also
involves a continuing perception that the government thinks that
what's good for Hong Kong's business tycoons is good for the city.</P>
      <P>"While this paradigm worked during the time of the British and
even up to the last decade, economic shifts favoring cheaper South
China cities in Guangdong Province are changing all the rules," they
wrote.</P>
      <P>However, they added, economists point to the city's proximity to
southern China as Hong Kong's number one asset, along with its
sophisticated mass of human capital. Moreover, the city remains
Asia's financial capital and maintains the leading container port. If
one adds the city's generally independent legal system, then Hong
Kong is poised to reinvent itself as mainland China enters the WTO
era, they wrote.</P>
      <P>"The final wrinkle, however, may be one of identity", they
pointed out, adding that a recent opinion poll found that less than
20 percent of high school students think of themselves as Chinese,
leading Hong Kong observers to question how well the city can
integrate itself with the mainland.</P>
      <P>"But as one Hong Kong expert explains, Hong Kong's salvation may
be its unsentimental willingness to change," they concluded.

    <HEADLINE>MAJORITY OF PEOPLE SUPPORT PROBE INTO SOURCES OF KMT ASSETS: POLL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  25  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The majority of respondents to a recent
poll support a Cabinet proposal to pass a special law that would
allow a probe into the main opposition Kuomintang's (KMT's) huge
party assets, according to the results of the poll released Thursday.</P>
      <P>The telephone survey of 1,065 randomly chosen adult residents was
conducted by the weekly magazine Open from Oct. 15-17 with the aim of
exploring public opinion on the Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP)-led government's recent decision to draft a special bill to
pave the way for a probe into the sources of the KMT's wealth.</P>
      <P>The poll results show that 61.5 percent of the respondents gave a
thumbs-up to the Cabinet proposal.</P>
      <P>Moreover, 68.86 percent said they believe that at least some of
the KMT assets were acquired by illegal means, while 44.68 percent of
those interviewed said they think that more than half of the KMT's
fortune was snatched illegally.</P>
      <P>In addition, 41.58 percent said they believe that investigating
the sources of the party's assets would benefit all of the people of
Taiwan, although 29.63 percent said they think that such a move would
most benefit the ruling DPP.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, 60.66 percent also agreed with the view that the
Cabinet's plan to look into sources of the KMT's assets is mainly a
campaign strategy in the run-up to the Dec. 1 elections for
legislators, city mayors and county magistrates.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 47.93 percent of the survey respondents said they do
not think any of the country's political parties are especially clean
or non-corrupt.</P>
      <P>In comparison, 58.24 percent said they think that the KMT, which
ruled Taiwan for 55 years until May 2000, is most corrupt; followed
by the DPP (16.95 percent), the People First Party (4.6 percent), the
newly formed Taiwan Solidarity Union (1.82 percent) and the New Party
(0.77 percent).</P>
      <P>The KMT is considered to be the world's wealthiest political
party, with assets estimated at anything between US$6.7 billion and
US$16 billion.</P>
      <P>Analyzing the survey results, DPP Legislative Whip Tsai
Huang-lang urged the KMT to respond to public opinion and voluntarily
return its "illegally" acquired party assets to the national coffers.</P>
      <P>Tsai said that as the KMT still controls the majority of the
seats in the legislature, it will not be an easy task to pass a
special law to provide a legal framework for a probe into the KMT's
assets.</P>
      <P>Quoting the survey results, Wang Tan-ping, chief executive of the
KMT's policy research department, pointed out that more than 60
percent of the survey respondents regard the proposal to probe the
KMT's assets as "yet another of the DPP's campaign tricks."</P>
      <P>In response, DPP legislators Parris Chang and Yeh Yi-chin said
that is irrelevant and that "most important point is that the
majority of the people back the proposal to probe the legality of the
KMT assets."</P>

      <P>A visiting Indian trade mission made up of
40-plus members met with Taiwan trade officials and traders Thursday
for business talks at the China External Trade Development Council
(CETRA) building.</P>
      <P>The Indian trade mission arrived in Taipei Wednesday for trade
talks under the co-sponsorship of the CETRA Office in Bombay and the
India-Taipei Association in Taipei.</P>
      <P>S.K. Verma, director of the India-Taipei Association (ITA) in
Taipei, and Chang Shih-chang, director of the CETRA Office in Bombay,
attended the talks. More than 100 local traders also took part in the
meeting.</P>
      <P>Chang said that the Indian traders in the mission mostly come
from Bombay's Maharashtra district, the financial center of the city,
adding that they are interested in purchasing machine tools,
agricultural machines, semi-manufactured chemicals and electronics.</P>
      <P>Chang pointed out that the there is potential for Taiwan
manufacturers and business firms to increase their sales in the
Indian market, noting that India's gross domestic product growth for
this year is expected to hit 6 percent despite the global economic
slowdown.</P>
      <P>Taiwan exported US$474 million worth of goods to India and
imported US$382 million of goods in the first nine months of this
year, representing a 14.3 percent drop in exports but a 0.9 percent
increase in imports over the same period in the previous year. S.K.
Verma said that although two-way trade between Taiwan and India has
decreased slightly, it has remained stable compared with trade with
other regions.</P>
      <P>The Indian official also called on local traders to grab the
opportunity to tap the Indian market in the wake of the United States

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN ECONOMY COULD REBOUND IN 2ND QUARTER NEXT YEAR: THINK TANK</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 25 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's economy could start to rebound in
the second quarter of next year and see an obvious recovery in the
second half of next year, the head of a local think tank said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Wu Rong-i, president of the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research
(TIER), said that in the wake of the terrorist attacks in the United
States, there are uncertain factors in the world economy and added
that the length of the military campaign in Afghanistan will be
crucial to the global economic recovery.</P>
      <P>Wu predicted that the war will not last too long and that it will
not expand further. He also pointed out that the key to Taiwan's
recovery hinges on when the U.S. economy will rebound.</P>
      <P>Wu also said that as the military campaign against terrorism
continues, the U.S. dollar could soften and he did not rule out the
possibility that the Taiwan dollar will appreciate against the
greenback, although such a rise would be modest. However, he added
that the local currency could depreciate in the short term.</P>
      <P>On interest rates, Wu also said that although short term interest
rates have dropped to a historic low, the domestic economy is still
poor and he predicted that Taiwan's interest rate will continue to be
low.</P>
      <P>He said that with the sluggish economy and high unemployment, the
government can only expand public expenditure to help stimulate
private investment.</P>
      <P>Wu also said that as people tend to deal with pay cuts by not
spending, the government should distribute "purchasing coupons" to
the public to increase consumption.</P>
      <P>He said that after the Economic Development Advisory Conference,
the nation reached a consensus on domestic economic issues and
confidence in the nation returned. However, he expressed regret that
the terrorist attacks on the United States have had a negative impact
on good economic prospects.</P>
      <P>TIER officials also unveiled the results of a survey on domestic
manufacturers, which show that the number of respondents who
predicted that the economy will improve in the next six months
decreased to 14.9 percent from 18.7 percent in the previous month,
while those who think the economy will worsen increased to 38 percent
from 22.9 percent in the previous month.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Government agencies mobilized over 1,000
military, medical, police and environmental protection personnel
Thursday in their second joint exercise staged at a Taipei subway
station to simulate possible responses against a chemical attack.</P>
      <P>Hau Lung-bin, who heads the Environmental Protection
Administration (EPA), oversaw the 90-minute drill.</P>
      <P>He said that the primary objective was to familiarize the public
with the necessary measures to take, while government agencies were
given the opportunity to rehearse their coordination with each other
in the event of such an emergency.</P>
      <P>The exercise began when a mock terrorist released an unknown
toxic gas in the passenger compartment of a subway train at the
Hsiaonanmen Station of the Taipei Mass Rapid Transit system.</P>
      <P>When mock commuters began suffering from signs of gas poisoning,
police and medical personnel were called in to conduct first-aid and
carry out an evacuation.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, emergency teams from the EPA, the Department of Health
and the chemical warfare branch of the military determined the type
of gas used in the attack, raced to neutralize the threat and
sanitized the station.</P>
      <P>A similar exercise was conducted last Friday, but on a smaller
scale. About 500 people took part in that drill.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian urged relevant government agencies
Monday to heighten their level of alertness to all possible forms of
terrorist biochemical warfare and to take effective steps to help
enhance public awareness of the anthrax threat.</P>
      <P>Chen gave the directives after presiding over a fourth high-level
national security meeting regarding the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in
the United States.</P>
      <P>In addition to staging drills and intensifying the campaign to
inform the public, he said, the government should start evaluating

      <P>An official of the Cabinet-level Overseas

year by year.</P>
      <P>Statistics compiled by OCAC show that 9,357 overseas Chinese

academic year. The number increased to 10,566 in the 1999 academic
year and again to 11,033 in 2000.</P>

      <P>Meanwhile, in order to promote international academic exchanges

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT CHEN HAILS TSMC NEW INVESTMENT PLANS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Tainan,  Taiwan,  Oct.  25  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said
Thursday he is very pleased to learn that Taiwan Semiconductor
Manufacturing Corp. (TSMC) has decided to launch new investment
plans at two of the island's high-tech industrial parks.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks during a visit to the TSMC's newest
manufacturing facility in the Tainan Science-based Industrial Park
in southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"The TSMC's new investment plans manifest its support for the
government's ambitious bid to develop Taiwan into a regional
operation hub," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan still enjoys competitive edges in the
high-tech industry development, Chen said local businesses and
individual people should remain confident in the island's
developmental potential, despite current domestic woes.</P>
      <P>Chen said his administration will make every possible effort to
improve the domestic investment climate and drop all unnecessary
restrictions and improper interferences in economic activities.</P>
      <P>"By so doing," Chen said, "we hope to create an environment where
all enterprises can exercise their vitality and creativity freely and
fully to enhance their competitiveness in the global market."</P>
      <P>Based on Taiwan's current high-tech basis, Chen said, the
government intends to nurture even more creative and productive new
enterprises.</P>
      <P>Touching on the government's policy toward trade and economic
ties with mainland China, Chen said his administration has replaced
the "no haste, be patient" policy with a more positive approach --
"active opening and effective management."</P>
      <P>"The policy adjustment was based on the principles of 'Taiwan
first,' 'economy first' and the demand of domestic enterprises,"
Chen explained, adding that mainland China would be part of Taiwan's
global development plan.</P>
      <P>Chen also lauded the TSMC for its completion of a professional
study which confirms that, through engineering technology, the
effects of vibrations from a high-speed railway project near the
Tainan science park on microchip fabrication can be eliminated.</P>
      <P>TSMC is the world's leading microchip foundry service. Chen
said he hopes that the TSMC's study would help lure investors back to
the southern Taiwan high-tech industrial stronghold.</P>
      <P>Several local semiconductor manufacturing firms have shelved
their investment plans in the Tainan industrial park over concerns
regarding possible vibrations from the high-speed railway project.</P>
      <P>TSMC was among the first group of local enterprises to build
production facilities in the Tainan park. Its first chip factory in
the park began volume production in January 1999. Construction of its
second plant in the Tainan park for 8-inch wafer fabrication was
suspended earlier this year over vibration concerns.</P>
      <P>TSMC Chairman Morris Chang announced in a speech welcoming
Chen's visit that construction on the new plant has resumed after
the study confirmed the viability of its investment plan in the
park.</P>
      <P>In the past, Chang said, TSMC focused its investments in the
Hsinchu Science-based Industrial Park in northern Taiwan. As the park
has reached its capacity, he said, the company has decided to make
the Tainan park its most important site for its future semiconductor
production in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chang further said Taiwan has proven itself to be a suitable
location for semiconductor manufacturing. "As long as corporate
enterprises and the government continue to work together, Taiwan
will maintain its competitive edge in the world market."</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, TSMC Deputy Chief Executive
Officer F. C. Tseng said TAMC will invest up to NT$700 billion
(US$20.29 billion) over the next 10 to 15 years in building five
12-inch wafer plants in the Tainan parks and a new 12-inch wafer
factory in the Hsinchu park.</P>

      <P>Republic of China envoy to the
Vatican Raymond Tai said Wednesday that the government hopes that the
Roman Catholic Church in Taiwan can serve as a bridge between the
Vatican and Beijing to jointly help Catholics in mainland China
regain religious freedom.</P>
      <P>Tai was in Vatican City to take part in a congress to commemorate
the fourth centenary of the arrival in Beijing of Jesuit missionary
Matteo Ricci. The congress was sponsored by the Italian-Sino
Association.</P>
      <P>Tai made the remarks after Pope John Paul II asked Beijing in a
historic statement to forgive "errors" committed by the Roman
Catholic Church.</P>
      <P>The pontiff's statement continued: "The failings of the church
may have given the impression of a lack of respect and esteem for the
Chinese people on the part of the catholic church, making them feel
that the church was motivated by feelings of hostility toward China."</P>
      <P>Tai expressed his gratitude to the pontiff for his sincerity in
attempting to resolve the historic and cultural conflicts existing
between the Roman Catholic Church and the Chinese people and
expressed hope that Chinese around the world will regard the
pontiff's statement as an act of goodwill.</P>
      <P>He added that the ROC government and people would be happy to see
the Vatican and Beijing resume dialogue, as it would help to promote
religious freedom in the mainland.</P>

Strasbourg to receive a human rights award.</P>
      <P>The French government declined to grant Chen a visa that would

Liberal International (LI), which has aroused the attention of some
European democratic parties.</P>
      <P>Ulrich Irmer, speaker of the FDP caucus on foreign policy in

Taiwan, after a tremendous change in political and social aspects
during the last 18 months, can serve as a model for dictatorships in
some developing countries.</P>
      <P>He noted that Chen, who assumed his post in May last year, has
been active in promoting human rights and striving to ease the
tension between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, which is why he
won the LI Prize for Freedom.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has transformed from a one-party authoritarian political

acceptable definition for the so-called "one China" issue.</P>
      <P>The freedom of choice of the 23 million people in Taiwan must be
respected and both sides should be accorded equal status and must not
threaten the other through force or violence, he went on.</P>
      <P>Chen said that an improvement in bilateral ties must start with
the establishment of stable cross-Taiwan Strait relations. In the
short term, he continued, there might not be a breakthrough. However,
he added that stabilizing the current relationship so that it does
not continue to deteriorate would be a "good beginning."</P>
      <P>He said that Taiwan's accomplishments, such as its
democratization and the first peaceful transfer of political power to
an opposition party, will "undoubtedly" become a beacon that will
guide mainland China toward democratization and modernization.</P>
      <P>In regard to bilateral trade, Chen said that the mainland Chinese
market must be viewed as a part of the global market. Therefore, he
said, the "no haste, be patient" regulatory policy for Taiwanese
investment in the mainland must be replaced by an "active opening,
effective management" policy based on the principles of "Taiwan
first, global perspective, common interests and crisis management."</P>

    <HEADLINE>SOCIAL WELFARE SPENDING ON TAIWAN WOMEN LESS THAN NT$100 EACH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 25 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Each of Taiwan's adult women received only
an average NT$94.2 in social welfare benefits in cities and counties
across the island in 2000, according to a report released Thursday.</P>
      <P>According to the report compiled by the Civil Social Welfare
Promotion Task Force, which was formed by various social welfare
organizations, Taoyuan County allocated the highest amount of NT$127
million for women's welfare spending last year, accounting for 3.87
percent of the county's total social welfare spending.</P>
      <P>Hsinchu County ranked second with an allocation of NT$85.7
million, which represents in turn the highest ratio of 13.65 percent
as a percentage to the county's total social welfare expenditure.</P>
      <P>Calculating at the standard 5 percent set by the central
government, Hsinchu County is the only local government to have
surpassed the lowest level, the report said, adding that 10 other
counties and cities failed to reach even 1 percent.</P>
      <P>Changhua County sat at the bottom, having earmarked only NT$9.8
-- or 0.14 percent of the total -- for each of its female adult
citizens, ahead of Taichung City's NT$13.4, according to the report.</P>
      <P>The report said the rating was made to demonstrate that Taiwan
women's welfare rights are seriously ignored by the authorities and
it urged the government to improve the situation by increasing
professional personnel and budgets in line with the growth rate of
the female population.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>No foreign organizations in Taiwan have
received letters or packages containing substances bearing any
resemblance to anthrax spores, a spokeswoman for the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Chang Siao-yue said at a regular weekly news conference that her
ministry had checked with foreign organizations reported by local
press to have taken delivery of questionable letters or packages and
was told that no suspicious substances were discovered.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, she went on, the Foreign Ministry, which has kept
close contact with foreign organizations in Taiwan since the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks in New York and Washington, has been working with
police to step up security at local foreign organizations.</P>
      <P>She made the comments to dismiss local media reports that the
trade offices of South Korea, India and German had received letters
containing questionable substances.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a police officer in Taipei said a suspicious package
sent to the German trade office in Taipei the day before yesterday
had proved to be a hoax.</P>
      <P>The package, bearing a Canadian postmark, raised the suspicions
of the staff at the German trade office because it had no return
address and they called in police to investigate.</P>
      <P>The officer, who asked not to be named, refused to reveal the
contents of the package, but admitted that a police explosives team
was sent to the trade office.</P>
      <P>Since the package came from overseas, the police said they could
do nothing but ask the related foreign authorities for help in
tracing its source.</P>
      <P>The local media reported earlier in the day that questionable
white powder had been found in at least nine letters sent to the
South Korean and Indian trade offices in Taipei, respectively.</P>
      <P>The two countries' trade offices are located in the Taipei World
Trade Center and two of the suspicious letters were sent from
Pintung, southern Taiwan, to the presidents of each country.</P>
      <P>All the letters were sent to local health agencies for testing
and health officials said it takes 24 hours to ascertain whether the
white substance is the feared anthrax spores, according to the
reports.</P>
      <P>Local press reports also said that a package delivered to the
Israeli trade office in Taipei, which is also in the trade center,
was sent to police that same day for investigation.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CATHOLIC OFFICIAL URGES NO `POLITICIZATION' OF PONTIFF'S STATEMENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  25 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Catholic official on Thursday urged the
public to be open-minded and not to politicize a recent statement by
Pope John Paul II at a symposium in Rome.</P>
      <P>John B. Wu, secretary-general of the Chinese Regional Bishops'
Conference, said that the pontiff's statement Wednesday in which he
"asked forgiveness" for past "errors" in mainland China should not be
construed as the possible impending establishment of diplomatic
relations between the Vatican and Beijing.</P>
      <P>The pope's statement was read at the Oct. 24-25 symposium, which
was sponsored by Italian-Chinese Institute to commemorate the fourth
centenary of the arrival in Beijing of Jesuit missionary Matteo
Ricci.</P>
      <P>The pontiff said that he feels "deep sadness for the errors of
the past" and regrets that "in many people, this feeling may have
given the impression of lack of respect and esteem for Chinese people
on the part of the Roman Catholic Church, making them feel that the
church was motivated by feelings of hostility toward Chinese."</P>
      <P>"For all of this, I ask the forgiveness and understanding of
those who may have felt hurt in some way by such actions" on the part
of Christians, the pontiff said in his statement.</P>
      <P>Local media immediately asked if the pontiff's statement will
have nay impact on the Republic of China's relations with the
Vatican, the ROC's only ally in Europe.</P>
      <P>Wu said that as there are millions of Catholics in the mainland,
the pontiff's statement was aimed only at expressing goodwill toward
the Beijing authorities for the welfare and rights of Catholics in
the mainland.</P>
      <P>He noted that it was the first time that the pope had spoken
openly of errors and had asked for forgiveness as the leader of the
Catholic Church, adding that his "wise approach," despite the lack of
communication and dialogue channels between the Vatican and Beijing,
should win kudos from the world.</P>
      <P>Addressing concerns as to whether the Vatican and Beijing will
establish diplomatic relations, Wu also said the key lies not in the
Vatican, but in Beijing.</P>
      <P>He said that communism is already bankrupt and that if Beijing
continues to maintain a tough attitude, the pontiff's goodwill or
sincerity will not do any good.</P>

    <HEADLINE>HIGH COURT ACQUITS BROTHER-IN-LAW OF FORMER MOST-WANTED FUGITIVE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  25  (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan High Court Thursday acquitted
the brother-in-law of former most-wanted fugitive Chen Chin-hsing of
charges that he served as Chen's accomplice in the 1997 murder of the
17-year-old daughter of TV celebrity Pai Ping-ping.</P>
      <P>In what was the second retrial for Chang's case, the court
overturned a previous life imprisonment sentence that was handed down
in the Taiwan High Court's second trial in September 1998 and upheld
in the subsequent first retrial.</P>
      <P>On Thursday, the court returned to the original ruling of not
guilty handed down by the Taipei District Court, saying that police
evidence and Chang's confessions -- which he said were extracted
under torture by investigators -- did not corroborate with each
other.</P>
      <P>Chang, who has been detained for over three years, was released
immediately after his acquittal but forbidden to relocate his
residence. He thanked the judge for "carefully investigating" his
case and said that he will go home to help his mother run her
business.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors have the right to file another appeal against the
latest ruling.</P>
      <P>In April 1997, Pai Hsiao-yen was kidnapped and killed after days
of torture by Chen and accomplices Lin Chun-sheng and Kao Tien-min.</P>
      <P>Chang was accused of guarding and torturing the teen and
assisting in disposing of her body after Chen had murdered her.</P>
      <P>Chen was executed in October 1999, while both Lin and Kao killed
themselves during separate shootouts with police in late 1997.</P>
      <P>Chen's wife Chang Su-chen was sentenced to nine months
imprisonment for hiding her husband when he was on the run.</P>
      <P>Chen had also been responsible for the kidnapping of a Taipei
county councilor in June 1997, the abduction of a businessman in
August that same year, the murder of a plastic surgeon, his wife and
a nurse at the surgeon's clinic in October, and the hostage-taking of
the family of South African military attache Col. McGill Alexander in
November, when he finally surrendered after a 24-hour standoff with
the police.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of academics called Thursday for
politicians who have entered the race for the year-end elections to
stop serving as television talk show hosts or hostesses.</P>
      <P>The academics, who described themselves as an independent
watchdog of the local mass media, are mainly members of the Formosa
Professor's Association, which is a group friendly to the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>They unveiled a list of local politicians who are either frequent
guests or who actually host television talk shows, blaming them for
what they called "skewing television broadcasts in their own favor."</P>
      <P>National Taiwan University Professor Lee Yung-chih said those
politicians have turned their TV appearances into free TV campaign
advertisements by pitching their "twisted" political views or
canvassing votes for themselves.</P>
      <P>Under their manipulation, Lee said, the local media has been
debased into the political mouthpieces of a cluster of politicians
rather than an independent "fourth estate."</P>
      <P>This, Lee said, is unfair for other candidates who have little
access to television or broadcasting and represents abuse of the mass
media.</P>
      <P>Besides appealing to media owners to shut these biased
politicians out of their studios, Lee said his group is calling for
the enactment of bills requiring television program hosts or
hostesses to quit their jobs once they register as candidates for
public office.</P>
      <P>Lee said his group also urged the national security agencies to
determine whether Beijing is pulling the strings behind Taiwan's
media.</P>
      <P>Politicians who were accused by the group of airing their
political prejudices on TV are chiefly candidates from opposition
parties, with the exception of two DPP candidates.</P>
      <P>The group also warned the public to exercise great caution when
tuning in to programs hosted by Li Ao and Sisy Chen in particular,
claiming that their programs are "extremely biased." According to the
group, these presenters are "known" for "excoriating the government"
or "pouring political satire on the DPP leaders" in their programs.</P>

    <HEADLINE>INT'L MEDIA EXPRESS CONCERN OVER TAIWAN'S ABSENCE FROM APEC SUMMIT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  25  (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Many foreign newspapers have expressed
concern over Beijing's mistreatment of the Republic of China at the
just-concluded informal summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) forum, the Government Information Office (GIO)
said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan withdrew from this year's APEC summit in Shanghai Oct.
20-21 over a dispute on who should represent ROC President Chen
Shui-bian at the gathering. Host Beijing vetoed the proposal of
Taiwan to send former ROC Vice President Li Yuan-zu on the grounds
that he lacked an economic or financial background.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan authorities also protested that Beijing did not
respect APEC protocol of sending an envoy to deliver a formal
invitation to the annual summit.</P>
      <P>The GIO, which asked ROC overseas representative offices to
explain to the world community the reason why Taiwan was absent from
the summit, said Thursday that many international media had reacted
to the incident.</P>
      <P>GIO officials noted that some newspapers, including the New York
Times, published Taiwan's explanation, while other dailies expressed
their support for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>A Boston Globe editorial said that Beijing should stop bullying
Taiwan, while an editorial in Japan's Mainichi Shimbun noted that
Beijing displayed narrow-mindedness in treating Taiwan the way it
did.</P>
      <P>The French daily Le Monde said: "This is the most serious
situation to have happened since APEC was founded."</P>
      <P>A Belgian paper noted that Beijing's efforts to create a good
image for Shanghai were overshadowed by the row, while an Italian
daily said Taiwan's absence at the summit affected the mood of the
gathering.</P>
      <P>Some European media said that Taiwan has lost its world stage
after the United States readjusted its international affairs
priorities following the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, while others
said that the gap between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait will
widen further after the dispute.</P>
      <P>Britain's Financial Times pointed out that the issue will affect
Taiwan's year-end legislative elections and increase Chen's
reputation.</P>
      <P>In Latin America, Panama's daily La Prensa published the whole
process of Taiwan's withdrawal from the summit under the title "China
Humiliates Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Panamanian diplomats also mentioned Beijing's lashing out at a
motion presented earlier this year by Panama to the United Nations in
support of the ROC's U.N. bid, stressing that Beijing's behavior in
blocking Taiwan's international stage is hegemonic.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SHOPPING MALLS TO IGNITE COMPETITION IN LOCAL RETAIL MARKET</HEADLINE>

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A state-of-the-art multi-function shopping
mall -- Breeze Center -- will open Friday, which is expected to stir
up a new wave of competition between traditional supermarkets and
large shopping malls in Taipei.</P>
      <P>The Breeze Center, a facility designed to create a high-end
shopping mall particularly for women, has set an annual business
target of NT$50 billion.</P>
      <P>By providing customers with a shopping center, recreational
facilities, restaurants, an art gallery and a large-scale retail
market in the complex, center officials said they hope to build a new
consumption pattern for Taipei citizens.</P>
      <P>Dismissing speculation that the center has chosen to join the
battlefield at a time when a severe economic slump has swept all
businesses in Taiwan following the Sept. 11 terror attacks in the
United States, a center executive said he is optimistic about the
purchasing capabilities of Taipei citizens.</P>
      <P>As the mall is located in Taipei's affluent "East District," he
said, he strongly believes that it will gain ground, particularly
among women aged between 25 and 39, despite the current sluggishness.</P>
      <P>"You can eat, drink, play and enjoy yourself within our
facilities," said C.C. Wu, manager of Core Pacific City, a new
shopping mall which is slated to be inaugurated in November.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that shopping malls are set to prevail in the future
retail market, Wu said the emergence of such comprehensive
establishments will create a consumer revolution and help stimulate
the market.</P>
      <P>Sogo Pacific Department Store, which has long enjoyed a
leadership role in Taipei's retail market and is located near the
Breeze Center, said it will be a big task for new-style shopping
malls to change the decades-old consumption habits of Taipei
residents.</P>
      <P>According to a Sogo executive, high-quality products and services
are always the key elements in the face of the fierce competition
from new multi-function facilities. "As long as the department stores
know where their customers are and provide distinctive products, they
will stand firm forever," he said.</P>

(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Ministry of Foreign
Affairs (MOFA) Spokeswoman Chang Siao-yue affirmed Thursday Pope John
Paul II's statement regarding past Catholic "errors" in China.</P>
      <P>In his statement addressed to a congress held Wednesday, the
pontiff asked China to forgive "errors" committed by the Roman
Catholic Church in the past, in the hope of normalizing the Holy
See's relations with mainland China.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the statement, Chang said: "The ROC government
affirms and admires the frankness of the Holy See for its willingness
to face history and ask the Chinese people for forgiveness."</P>
      <P>However, she went on, the government wants to remind the Holy See
that mainland China "remains at present an autocratic government
which neglects religious freedom and democracy."</P>
      <P>Chang said that the ROC and the Holy See have maintained cordial
relations since the normalization of bilateral relations in 1942.</P>
      <P>She noted that the Holy See, based on humanitarian
considerations, has been deeply concerned about the religious freedom
of some 10 million Catholics on the mainland.</P>
      <P>In this regard, Chang said, the ROC government "is willing to
cooperate with and help the Holy See to promote religious freedom in
mainland China."</P>
      <P>However, she pointed out that the Beijing government continues to
deny religious freedom and added that Beijing's stand "is totally
contrary to the Holy See's concept of promoting religious freedom."</P>
      <P>The 81-year-old pope said in his statement that it is no secret
that the Vatican hopes for the opening of some form of dialogue with
Beijing.</P>
      <P>"Once the misunderstandings of the past have been overcome," he
said, "such a dialogue would make it possible for us to work together
for the good of the Chinese people and for peace in the world."</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian vowed Thursday to
continue with his government reforms by first of all cutting the
number of agencies under the Executive Yuan by one-third over a
two-year period.</P>
      <P>Presiding over the first meeting of the government reform
committee, Chen said in the same breath that the incumbent government
employee's interests will be fully protected under the government's
streamlining program.</P>
      <P>At the same time, the government will revamp regulations on
recruiting new staff to ensure that the administration will get
first-class talent into the government in order to offer the public
first class service.</P>
      <P>However, the president went on, government reform cannot succeed
without amending the country's Constitution, which lays down the
mandates of the president and the administration led by the premier,
as well as the powers and liabilities of the Executive Yuan and the
legislature.</P>
      <P>Noting that the vague ties between the popular president and the
legislature under the existing Constitution underlies many disputes

opposition-controlled legislature, Chen said a revision of the
Constitution is necessary to rid the country of its political unrest.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER ORDERS MND TO REVIEW ALLEGED NORTH-SOUTH DEFENSE IMBALANCE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Oct.   26   (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung said
Friday he will direct the Ministry of National Defense (MND) to study
whether a defense imbalance truly exists between the northern and
southern parts of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chang made the promise during a Legislative Yuan
question-and-answer session in response to opposition Kuomintang
Legislator Chiang Chi-wen's criticism that the military has failed to
place equal emphasis on defense measures in northern and southern
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The lawmaker from the southern Taiwan port city of Kaohsiung
claimed that the MND has traditionally given more emphasis on defense
buildup in the densely populated northern part of the island.</P>
      <P>As a result, Chiang said, many of the country's major economic
establishments and military installations in southern Taiwan,
including Chinese Petroleum Corp., Linyuan Oil Refinery, China
Shipbuilding Corp., Kaohsiung Harbor, and Tsoying naval base, have
been exposed to rival mainland China's missile threat.</P>
      <P>Noting that mainland China has deployed more than 300 M-class
missiles in its southeastern province of Fujian, which lies opposite
Taiwan, Chiang said she couldn't understand why the military has
deployed all of the three sets of the "Patriot PAC-2 plus"
anti-missile defense system, purchased from the United States, in
northern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chiang said she hopes that the MND can come up with a
comprehensive plan to improve the imbalance in defense buildup in
northern and southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In response, Premier Chang said he would ask the MND to conduct
an overall review of defense measures and installations around the
island and craft a feasible package to fortify defense buildup in
southern Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAGAZINE ASSOCIATION TO SPONSOR INTERNATIONAL CONFAB IN NOVEMBER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 26 (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Magazine Business Association of Taipei
(MBAT) will sponsor the 2001 International Magazine Conference of
Taipei Nov. 13-14 at the National Central Library in Taipei.</P>
      <P>In addition to local publishers and media members, the
association has invited experts from the magazine business in the
United States, France, Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong and South Korea to
be keynote speakers at the two-day conference.</P>
      <P>James Jin, chairman of the association, said Friday that Taiwan's
magazine business has been affected by the economic slump. It is
expected that through the exchange of opinions among publishers from
different markets, local publishers can learn from the experiences of
their counterparts.</P>
      <P>This will be the second international magazine conference
sponsored by the association. The first International Magazine
Conference of Taipei was held April 12-14, 1999. Executives of
leading international publishing houses and advertising companies
were invited to the conference.</P>
      <P>Topics to be discussed at the conference will include launching a
new magazine, advertising sales, strategies against economic
depression, Asia-Pacific media development and trends, and online
strategies.</P>
      <P>The Magazine Business Association of Taipei was established in
December 1996, with about 200 members running over 400 magazines.</P>
      <P>At the end of 1998, there were over 5,700 magazines registered
with the authorities. Most of the magazines were internal company
periodicals, association or corporate newsletters, religious
publications or academic research journals. Only some 500 magazines
were licensed to be marketed, Jin said.</P>
      <P>As the coming of the Internet era has had a great impact upon the
local magazine industry, the association has tried to work out
editorial as well as marketing strategies to meet the challenge. In
January 1998, the association organized 108 magazine publishing
houses to present a web magazine exhibition which enabled better
interaction among publishers and their readers.</P>
      <P>Jin said that the association is planning to construct a website,
which will have a payment mechanism for the subscription of magazine
articles.</P>
      <P>In recent years, many Taiwan magazines have sought to expand
their business to mainland China, a market with tremendous potential
for Chinese-language publications. Jin said that the discussions at
the conference will provide some ideas to local publishers in mapping
out their marketing strategies in Chinese communities outside Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KINMEN PASSENGER SHIP MAKES BREAKTHROUGH IN `MINI THREE LINKS'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 26 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A passenger ship sailed from a harbor other
than Liaolo directly to mainland China Friday, making a breakthrough
in the "mini three links" implemented by the Republic of China
government at the start of this year on a trial basis.</P>
      <P>The ship, carrying 151 passengers, sailed for Xiamen from
Shueitou Wharf at 9:20 a.m. The passengers had earlier checked in at
the passenger center at Liaolo Harbor, east of Kinmen, and then took
four buses to Shueitou Wharf, located west of Kinmen.</P>
      <P>When the government opened direct trade, postal and
transportation links between Taiwan's two offshore islands of Kinmen
and Matsu and mainland China on Jan.1, 2001, which are commonly
referred to as "the three mini links," it designated Liaolo Harbor as
the departure point in Kinmen for Xiamen, and Fuao Harbor in Matsu as
the departure point for Mawei Port in Fuzhou. The passenger ship
therefore broke the "one place, one harbor" limitation by sailing
from Shueitou Wharf.</P>
      <P>The distance between Liaolo Harbor and Heping Wharf in Xiamen is
about 24 nautical miles, and the sailing time is about two-and-a-half
hours, with the route passing through the turbulent stretch of sea
off Kukang. In comparison, the distance from Shueitou Wharf is only
16 nautical miles, and the sailing time is about an hour less.</P>
      <P>The Kinmen county government and private sector have long been
suggesting that the government turn Shueitou Wharf into a departure
point for the mainland, and the central government finally gave the
green light recently.</P>
      <P>Travel agencies applied to the Ministry of Transportation and
Communications one week ago under the name of the Kinmen County
Association for the Welfare of the Disabled and then obtained
approval to depart from Shueitou Wharf.</P>
      <P>Lee Hsi-shun, head of the association, said that taking the
shorter route will save a lot of time and trouble for passengers,
adding that such measures are very convenient for the people.</P>
      <P>Lee Chu-feng of the opposition New Party and Wu Cheng-tien,
deputy director of the Cross-Strait Association in Kinmen and Matsu
were also on hand for the event. Both of them said that the sailing
from Shueitou Wharf was a breakthrough, expressing the hope that such
travel will become more common in the future and that approval will
not need to be applied for on a case-by-case basis.</P>
      <P>The 151 passengers included a 55-member group from the Kinmen
County Association for the Welfare of the Disabled as well as 96
tourists taking part in five-day tours and exchanges in Xiamen.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  26 (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A research group consisting of staff from
National Taiwan University, Academia Sinica and the Institute of
Biochemical Science has identified a tumor suppresser gene, Collapsin
Response Mediator Protein-1 (CRMP-1), which can be applied in cancer
diagnosis and therapy.</P>
      <P>Yang Pan-chi, medical director of National Taiwan University
Hospital, said Friday that the unveiling of the gene map secret has
advanced medical research in cancer therapy.</P>
      <P>After nearly five years of research work, the biomedical group
found that activation of CRMP-1 can suppress the proliferation of
malignant cells in lung cancer patients.</P>
      <P>Yang said that the fatality ratio of female lung cancer patients
in Taiwan is pretty high, while cancer cell proliferation was found
among 80 percent of the patients within two years after surgery. Less
than 15 percent of the patients diagnosed with lung cancer managed to
survive for more than five years.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 26 (CNA)
(By Edward Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Chang Chung-hsiung Friday rebutted
Vice President Annette Lu's statement on the government's misjudgment
in the recently concluded Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)
forum informal leadership summit.</P>
      <P>Chang made the remarks while answering a question raised by
opposition Kuomintang Legislator Liao Wan-ju at a Legislative Yuan
interpellation session.</P>
      <P>According to Liao, the government's decision to withdraw from the
informal leadership summit was a misjudgment and only Lu had told the
truth. The government's misjudgment of the situation will possibly
lead to Taiwan losing its place on the international stage, Liao
claimed.</P>
      <P>Chang replied that the Chen Shui-bian administration decided to
withdraw from the summit for the sake of upholding the nation's
dignity. Therefore, Chang said, Lu's statement did not correspond to
the facts.</P>
      <P>Economics Minister Lin Hsin-yi backed Chang, saying that the
Ministry of Economic Affairs had prepared for the best and the worst
possible scenarios, the best being that Presidential Senior Adviser
Li Yuan-zu could attend the summit and the worst being that the
government would send an alternate candidate or miss the meeting.</P>
      <P>Liao then asked who had been chosen as an alternate candidate, at
which point Chang appeared to suddenly change his story, replying
that in fact, President Chen was originally scheduled to attend the
meeting and the alternate candidate was actually Li. Liao ridiculed
this policy decision as a "mission impossible."</P>

    <HEADLINE>PFP LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS TO PROPOSE 10% PAY CUT FOR LAWMAKERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  26  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The legislative caucus of the opposition
People First Party (PFP) said Friday that it will come up with a
proposal demanding a 10 percent pay cut for all lawmakers amid the
current domestic woes and rising unemployment rate.</P>
      <P>"We hope that the initiative will inspire highly paid senior
government officials to follow suit," PFP parliamentary whip Chou
Hsi-wei told a news conference.</P>
      <P>In the draft bill, Chou said, the PFP will propose that all
legislators be subject to a 10 percent pay cut, but that their aides
be exempt from any salary reduction.</P>
      <P>Chou said many people have complained that lawmakers are paid
excessively.</P>
      <P>"In view of the nation's financial straits and lingering economic
gloom," Chou said, "legislators should take the initiative to
voluntarily lower their pay to set a model for society."</P>
      <P>Chou added his hope that senior-grade officials (grades 10-14)
will also be subject to the proposed salary reduction.</P>
      <P>The legislative caucuses of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party and two other opposition parties -- the Kuomintang (KMT) and
the New Party -- all threw their support behind the pay cut proposal.</P>
      <P>DPP legislative whip Tsai Hung-lang said he feels that the
current NT$530,000 (US$15,362.32) monthly pay for lawmakers,
particularly those who devote their full energy to legislative work
and public service, is "reasonable."</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, he went on, the DPP caucus is willing to support
the pay cut bill in consideration of the government's financial
difficulties.</P>
      <P>As for a proposed pay cut for high-ranking officials, Tsai said,
the DPP caucus could not make any response at the moment. "There has
been an established pay scale and system for all civil servants,"
Tsai said, adding that any adjustment of the system needs a
comprehensive review.</P>
      <P>In contrast, New Party legislative whip Ying Chih-hung said that
his party caucus supports the 10 percent pay cut for all lawmakers
and hopes that the move can inspire an appropriate salary reduction
for high-ranking civil servants.</P>
      <P>KMT caucus whip Lee Cheng-chung said he basically agrees with the
pay cut proposal. "Nevertheless," he continued, "as lawmakers'
salaries are based on the general pay scale for all civil servants,
any adjustment should be preceded with a systematic review lest it
damage the whole system."</P>
      <P>As the KMT, which ruled Taiwan for 55 years until May 2000, still
controls a majority in the legislature, any pay cut proposal needs
its support to pass to the legislative floor.</P>
      <P>During a parliamentary question-and-answer session held earlier
in the day, Premier Chang Chun-hsiung did not make any direct reply
to a question as to whether he would agree to a proposal to halve his
"special expense account."</P>
      <P>Chang instead said the Cabinet has launched an austerity campaign
demanding that all government agencies and public educational and
research institutes trim their expenditure by at least 7 percent
during the rest of the current fiscal year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN FLASHES BLUE RECESSION LIGHT FOR 10TH CONSECUTIVE MONTH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 26 (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's economy in September again flashed
a blue light, representing a recession in the country's official
rating system, the Cabinet-level Council for Economic Planning and
Development (CEPD) announced Friday.</P>
      <P>It was the 10th consecutive month that the island's economy had
flashed a blue light, the rating system's worst situation.</P>
      <P>In the past two decades, the longest period during which Taiwan
has flashed a blue recession light was from September 1981 to March
1983 -- 19 consecutive months.</P>
      <P>Between March 1995 and November 1995, the same condition lasted
nine straight months.</P>
      <P>The CEPD predicted that the speed of Taiwan's economic recovery
will depend on such factors as the progress of U.S. actions against
terrorism and whether the ruling and opposition parties can work
together to boost the economy.</P>
      <P>In the CEPD-devised five-color system, a red light signifies an
overheated economy; yellow-red indicates that the economy is heating
up; green reflects steady growth; yellow-blue signals economic
sluggishness; and blue represents recession.</P>
      <P>In applying the system, the CEPD measures nine major areas of
economic activity, including exports, industrial production, stock
indices and orders placed in the manufacturing field.</P>
      <P>According to the CEPD, all nine areas registered blue lights in
September, indicating that the prospects of an early economic
recovery remain bleak.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taiwan's index of leading economic indicators for
September -- a key barometer of economic trends over the next three
to six months -- arrested its upswing momentum that had held for the
past three months and instead moderately dropped 0.9 percent from the
preceding month to end at 93.1 points.</P>
      <P>The index of coincident indicators, which looks at the economy's
current condition, plunged 3.4 percent to end at 95.8 points,
registering the sharpest drop since March 1974, when an energy crisis
was to blame.</P>
      <P>According to the CEPD, its most recent survey of local
manufacturers' confidence levels indicates that only 10 percent of
the respondents believe that the economy will take a turn for the
better in the next three months.</P>
      <P>Another 57 percent said that the economy will remain at the same
level, while the remaining 33 percent said that the economy will
deteriorate.</P>
      <P>The 10th cyclical slowdown in Taiwan's economic history began
last November, when the economy was given a yellow-blue light for
economic sluggishness. The blue recession light was officially
registered in December 2000.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHINESE WOMEN WITH DEFECTIVE GENES MORE PRONE TO LUNG CANCER: STUDY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  26  (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An increasing number of women in Taiwan,
Hong Kong and Singapore are getting lung cancer, with some
researchers believing that genetic problems are the root of the
problem, according to recent research.</P>
      <P>Yang Pan-chih, director of the internal medicine department of
National Taiwan University Hospital, who has conducted long-term
research into female lung cancer, said Friday that the latest results
show that Chinese women have between four and 50 defective genes.</P>
      <P>The genes in question are those that neutralize poison or
metabolize medicine, according to Yang.</P>
      <P>If more than three of these gene types are defective in an
individual, the lung cancer rate of these people will be 20 times
that of normal people, he claimed.</P>
      <P>He added that while exposure to kitchen smoke or second-hand
cigarette smoke can act as a catalyst, those who do not smoke or are
not exposed to kitchen smoke still have high a possibility of getting
lung cancer if they have defective genes.</P>
      <P>Department of Health statistics show that there are 6,000 new
cases of female lung cancer in Taiwan per year, with the fatality
rate exceeding that of liver cancer, a major killer in Chinese
society.</P>
      <P>The statistics also show that in Taiwan, death from lung cancer
in women has become the biggest cancer killer among women in the last
10 years and that its occurrence rate is still increasing gradually.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT SEEN MORE POLITICALLY THAN ECONOMICALLY ORIENTED: KMT POLL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  26  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian is generally
perceived as more politically than economically oriented, according
to the results of an opinion poll released Friday by the main
opposition Kuomintang (KMT).</P>
      <P>The telephone survey of 1,067 randomly chosen adult residents,
conducted by the KMT legislative caucus from Oct. 17-18, found that
51.27 percent of the respondents feel that Chen is working mainly for
political purposes -- more specifically, for the sake of his
Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP's) victory in the critical Dec. 1
elections for legislators and local administrative chiefs.</P>
      <P>Only 23.24 percent said they feel that Chen is really working to
rejuvenate the slumping domestic economy, despite his promises to the
contrary.</P>
      <P>The poll results also show that 56.7 percent are dissatisfied
with Chen's performance over the past 18 months, while 34.4 percent
approve of his overall performance.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 48.55 percent said they think that Chen's attribution
of his administration's lackluster achievements to opposition party
scheming is "unreasonable," but 34.02 percent said they agree with
his view.</P>
      <P>According to the poll, 47.14 percent think that Chen's attendance
at a fund-raiser organized by the DPP's largest Mainstream Faction
earlier this month was "inappropriate," while 35.52 percent gave a
thumbs-up to the move.</P>
      <P>About 46 percent said they think this kind of fund-raiser can
spur speculation about the possible influence of moneyed interests in
domestic politics, but 22.21 percent disagreed.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the survey findings, DPP legislative whip Tsai
Huang-lang said the KMT poll was politically motivated to smear
Chen's image.</P>
      <P>As a matter of fact, Tsai said, the survey was yet another of the
KMT's mud-slinging campaign tricks. "For one thing," he said, "the
questionnaire was biased, with the aim of demonizing Chen and
discrediting the government.</P>
      <P>"The truth is that President Chen convened a high-profile
economic development advisory conference in late August to underscore
his determination to rev up the sluggish domestic economy," Tsai
claimed.</P>

    <HEADLINE>VATICAN-TAIPEI TIES WILL REMAIN UNCHANGED: VICE FOREIGN MINISTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  26  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>the Republic of China's diplomatic ties
with the Vatican will remain unchanged as long as Beijing's
dictatorship remains unchanged, Vice Foreign Minister Chiou Jong-nan
predicted Friday.</P>
      <P>Answering questions from legislators about indications that
the Vatican is reaching out to Beijing, Chiou said at the Legislative
Yuan that the sticking point hindering the Vatican's ties with
Beijing is Beijing's reluctance to grant its people religious
freedom.</P>
      <P>The differences cannot be ironed out unless Beijing relaxes its
dictatorial rule and loosens its grip on its people's religious
activities, he said, adding that therefore, the chances of the
Vatican abandoning Taipei in favor of mainland China are slim.</P>
      <P>The Vatican's gesture toward Beijing is aimed at resuming
dialogue with Beijing, which will not be in any way prejudicial to
the ROC, said Chiou.</P>
      <P>His answer is similar to remarks made by a Foreign Ministry
spokeswoman a day earlier, when wire services reported that Pope John
Paul II had begged Chinese forgiveness for "past errors" committed by
the Catholic church in their country.</P>
      <P>The 81-year-old pontiff also said that the Vatican hopes to open
some form of dialogue with mainland China.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for Beijing's Foreign Ministry responded that his
government is ready to improve ties with the Vatican as long as the
Holy See severs its diplomatic ties with the ROC and promises not to
interfere with mainland China's internal affairs. He was referring to
the Holy See's right to choose bishops and cardinals, a right
disputed by Beijing.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile former Italian Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti, who is
widely believed to be an unofficial adviser to the Holy See, said in
Rome Thursday that the "Taiwan issue" could be easily resolved if
Beijing were to offer the prospect of diplomatic ties.</P>
      <P>However, Taipei seemed to take the diplomatic flirtation between
the Vatican and Beijing in its stride. ROC Ambassador to the Holy See
Raymond Tai said Thursday in Rome that he had been informed in
advance of the Vatican's overture toward Beijing and that he would be
happy to see the resumption of dialogue between the Vatican and
Beijing, which might promote religious freedom in mainland China.</P>

the World Trade Organization (WTO) Ministerial Meeting next month in
Qatar approves Beijing's entry.</P>
      <P>Lin also said that Beijing and its allies might possibly

Kuomintang Legislator Liao Wan-ju at a Legislative Yuan's

      <P>According to Liao, Beijing's rude treatment of Taiwan in the
recent Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation forum means that Beijing
may also interfere with Taiwan's WTO entry.</P>

WTO situation is quite different from the APEC issue. But he admitted

      <P>The Tzu Chi Medical Center and Buddhist
Tzu Chi University in Hualien, eastern Taiwan, have recently
established a joint research center for the study of liver disease,
Taiwan's leading cause of death.</P>
      <P>Lin Hsien-hung, leader of the research center, said Friday that
the researchers will try to find relationships between environment
exposure and hepatitis and cirrhosis in order to find ways to help
prevent the disease.</P>
      <P>The center will integrate three blood data banks belonging to the
Buddhist Tzu Chi University -- which include blood data on two of the
main aboriginal tribes in Taiwan -- and information about liver
disease compiled by the Tzu Chi Medical Center and other smaller
medical centers in the region.</P>
      <P>Lin added that after they expand the scale of their blood
databank, the research will focus on the study of hepatitis,
including epidemiology, the history of hepatitis and the effect of
alcohol on the liver.</P>
      <P>According to research statistics compiled over the last few
years, chronic hepatitis has become a major cause of death among
Taiwan people.</P>
      <P>Lin went on to say that hepatitis B and hepatitis C are factors
that predispose toward chronic hepatitis, although not all the
hepatitis B and hepatitis C patients will develop chronic hepatitis.</P>
      <P>Therefore, he said, there must be other factors that should be
studied, especially the effects of cigarettes, alcohol and betel-nut
on Taiwan people.</P>
      <P>According to Department of Health statistics about the top 10
killers in Taiwan last year, chronic hepatitis and hepatitis were the
No. 6 and No. 8 killers, respectively.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the liver disease rate in the Hualien area, which is
home to many of the island's aborigines, is the highest in Taiwan, a
situation that has also puzzled medical researchers and needs to be
further studied, Lin said.</P>

(By David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Various domestic goat's milk products
blended with cow's milk have been found bearing false labeling,
although the figure was roughly 50 percent lower than the previous
year, the Cabinet-level Department of Health (DOH) said Friday.</P>
      <P>Samples of 74 products which did not state on the label that the
product also contained cow's milk were tested by health bureaus
around the island and 12 samples, or 16.2 percent, were found to
contain cow's milk, considerably less than the 30 percent of
mislabeled products found during similar checks last year.</P>
      <P>Chen Shu-kong, director of the DOH's Bureau of Food Sanitation,
said that suppliers of mislabeled goat's milk products are subject to
fines of between NT$30,000 and NT$150,000.</P>
      <P>Goat's milk powder, goat's milk wafers, flavored goat's milk and
fresh goat's milk are all sold in Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC BACKS INCREASED CROSS-STRAIT NEWS MEDIA EXCHANGES: MAC OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  26  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China would like to see
increased exchanges among news media on the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait and is willing to ease restrictions on such exchanges, a
mainland affairs official said Friday.</P>
      <P>Chen Ming-tong, vice chairman of the Cabinet-level Mainland
Affairs Council (MAC), which charts Taiwan's policy toward mainland
China, made the remarks during a seminar on cross-strait relations
from a media perspective.</P>
      <P>Chen said that ever since Taiwan opened its doors to mainland
Chinese news media by allowing mainland journalists to visit Taipei
for up to one month on each visit, mainland media reports on Taiwan
have become more lively and realistic.</P>
      <P>"Even though mainland reporters have given more coverage to
negative than to positive events," Chen said, "the open-door measure
has at least helped prompt them to shed some stereotyped descriptions
of Taiwan and to adopt a more realistic approach in their reporting."</P>
      <P>To his knowledge, Chen said, mainland reporters have come to a
better understanding of the different media cultures and work
environments on the two sides since working here.</P>
      <P>Chen said he is convinced that increasingly realistic reports and
"reference information" dispatched by mainland journalists from
Taipei will also help prevent senior mainland officials from
misjudging Taiwan's situation and cross-strait events.</P>
      <P>"Through talks with mainland reporters stationed here," Chen
said, "I feel that many of them are impressed by Taiwan's press
freedom and its media's aggressiveness in criticizing the
government."</P>
      <P>Touching on a report that Beijing will allow Taiwan news
organizations to open permanent offices on the mainland, Chen said
the report would need to be confirmed.</P>
      <P>He further said that the MAC is more than willing to promote
cross-strait journalist exchanges on the principles of parity and
reciprocity.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PFP LEADER PLEADS FOR CAMPAIGN THAT DOES NOT SPLIT COUNTRY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  26  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>People First Party (PFP) Chairman James
Soong pleaded with local politicians Friday not to try to divide the
people while soliciting votes for the year-end elections.</P>
      <P>Stumping in Taipei for a PFP legislative candidate, the former
Taiwan provincial governor urged politicians of whatever political
parties to avoid using Taiwan's ethnic divide for political purposes.</P>
      <P>"Native Taiwanese" usually refers to people who moved to the
island from the southeastern coast of mainland China before 1949 and
now account for 85 percent of the island's population, while "aliens"
allude to those who fled to the island after 1949 when the
Nationalist Government relocated to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Soong, himself a so-called "alien," urged candidates to refrain
from seeking support by labeling their rivals "aliens" and thereby
free the public from the "spiritual prison" -- a term he borrowed
from Vice President Annette Lu, who has portrayed her 500-odd days in
office as "confinement in a spiritual prison" because, she claims,
she can no long express her opinions as she pleases.</P>
      <P>Soong also urged the Kuomintang -- the PFP's partner in the
opposition alliance at the Legislative Yuan -- to be more tolerant
toward KMT members who are sympathetic toward the PFP.</P>
      <P>Soong noted that the KMT expelled a well-known labor leader after
he was named by the PFP as a candidate for non-elected legislators.</P>
      <P>Instead of dismissing the labor leader, Soong said, the KMT
should have been glad that its member was tapped by its political
ally as a candidate.</P>
      <P>The former KMT secretary-general, who was expelled from the KMT
for running against the party's candidate in last presidential
election, said at the campaign rally that his party is not competing
to be the biggest party in the legislature but is rather struggling
to accomplish KMT founder Sun Yat-sen's political goal of "a country
belonging to the public, with the people as its supreme master."</P>

      <P>The Matsu Defense Command (MDC) confirmed
Friday that an anti-aircraft exercise dubbed "Wanping" had been

    <HEADLINE>KINMEN, NANAN SET GOOD EXAMPLE FOR CROSS-STRAIT COOPERATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kinmen,  Oct.  26 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A 44-member delegation from Nanan City in
mainland China's Fujian Province left Kinmen Friday for home after
concluding a five-day trade-promotion visit to the Taiwan-held
frontline island.</P>
      <P>The delegation's leader, Nanan Mayor Chen Qingchung, said before
the departure that Kinmen and Nanan have set up a good cooperation
model and that he expects private-sector exchanges between the two
sides to further grow, laying a solid foundation for developing
mutually beneficial ties.</P>
      <P>The Nanan delegation inked 28 cooperation accords with the Kinmen
business community during their visit. Importers of stone, gravel and
construction materials from Kinmen, Matsu and Taiwan placed orders
for more than 3 million metric tons -- worth NT$2 billion -- with the
delegation.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, cross-strait exchanges are set to bloom due to
the imminent entry of Taiwan and mainland China into the World Trade
Organization. As Kinmen and Nanan share the same language, blood
links and folk customs, Chen said he believes that two-way contacts
will become more diversified and increasingly frequent.</P>
      <P>The Nanan delegation left for their hometown aboard a ferry
operated by Kinmen County from Liaolo Port.</P>
      <P>Earlier the same day, a privately owned ferry carrying 151 Kinmen
passengers departed from Shuitou Port for Xiamen City in Fujian
Province, marking the first time that a boat from either Kinmen or
Matsu has embarked from Shuitou to the mainland Chinese side since
the establishment of the "mini three links" at the beginning of this
year.</P>
      <P>The local travel agency in charge of the trip applied to leave
from Shuitou on the grounds that some of the passengers were disabled
and the Ministry of Transport and Communications approved the
application.</P>
      <P>Liaolo Port, a trial embarkation point for the "mini three links"
between the two sides, is some 24 nautical miles away from Xiamen's
Hoping Port, while Shuitou Port is only 16 nautical miles away, a
difference of an hour's travel time.</P>
      <P>Local public opinion leaders, including New Party lawmaker Lee
Chu-feng and cross-strait trade promoters who witnessed the departure
in Shuitou, agreed unanimously that Shuitou is a good starting point
for direct shipping, trade and transport links between the two
offshore islands and Fujian Province.</P>
      <P>The Kinmen county government stressed that it strongly believes
that future approval of Liaolo Port as a departure point for the
"mini three links" will help strengthen bilateral shipping ties.</P>
      <P>Since the implementation of the "mini three links," ferries have
made a total of 96 trips between the two sides, carrying 8,130 people
from the Taiwan side to the mainland side and 520 mainland people to
Taiwan-controlled territory.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC PRESIDENT REITERATES RESOLVE TO PROMOTE CROSS-STRAIT TIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 26 (CNA)
(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian
said Friday that his determination to promote cross-Taiwan Strait
relations will not be affected by any factors.</P>
      <P>In an interview with Associated Press Television News, Chen said
that as president, he has "the duty and obligation to bring peace to
the Taiwan Strait as well as promote and complete the normalization
of cross-strait relations."</P>
      <P>Chen said that the ROC government fully supported the
incorporation of anti-terrorism into the agenda of the informal
leadership conference of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)
forum in Shanghai, but he expressed deep regret that owing to
Beijing's political interference, Taiwan was unable to participate in
the Oct. 20-21 summit.</P>
      <P>He stated that he affirms and admires U.S. President George
Bush's remarks in Shanghai to remind the Beijing authorities that
they should not take advantage of the global anti-terror campaign to
oppress the minority peoples in mainland China.</P>
      <P>He also noted that U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell and
National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice have repeatedly stressed
that the United States will not sacrifice Taiwan's interests in the
process of cooperating with Beijing to fight international terrorism.</P>
      <P>Chen criticized mainland China for failing to follow APEC
protocol by refusing to send an official to deliver a formal
invitation to Taiwan's delegate to the APEC leadership conference.</P>
      <P>Initially, Chen said, he had intended to attend the informal
summit himself, but about 10 days before the opening of the summit,
he appointed former Vice President Li Yuan-zu to represent him.
Beijing refused to accept Li's appointment and Taiwan was forced to
abstain from the informal summit for the first time.</P>
      <P>Asked what he would like to discuss with mainland Chinese
President Jiang Zemin if were allowed to visit Beijing, Chen said he
would hope to "exchange with him on the experiences and views over
the universal values of democracy, freedom and human rights."</P>
      <P>He noted that "we hope to negotiate and engage in dialogue with
them to promote cross-strait relations on the principles of
democracy, equality and peace."</P>
      <P>The president also said that the problems that have stalled the
development of bilateral relations are "not on the Taiwan side."</P>
      <P>He said that under Jiang's leadership, the Beijing government has
harbored "many misunderstandings" about Taiwan and does not
understand him and the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in
many areas.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Chen reiterated his determination to improve
cross-strait relations with "sincerity and goodwill."</P>
      <P>For instance, he said, that despite the APEC incident, the ROC
government's policy to implement the 322 resolutions reached by the
recent Economic Development Advisory Conference, including relaxing
control on Taiwan's trade and investment ties with the mainland, will
continue.</P>
      <P>Regarding the Dec. 1 local elections, Chen said that DPP
candidates might be able to win in 13-14 counties and cities of the
23 county magistrate and city mayor posts up for grabs.</P>
      <P>He went on to say that the ruling party might also be able to
replace the opposition Kuomintang as the biggest party in the
225-seat Legislative Yuan after simultaneous year-end legislative
elections, although no single party is expected to win a simple
majority.</P>
      <P>Therefore, he said, he is optimistic of forming a coalition
government under the control of the DPP after the elections.</P>
      <P>Chen also said that both Taiwan and mainland China are expected
to be admitted into the World Trade Organization at the WTO
ministerial meeting to be held in Qatar next month.</P>
      <P>He expressed hope that both sides will in future engage in
constructive interaction on the international economic and trade
stages under the framework of the global trade regulatory body.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 26 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian describes in a new
book to be published next week the scenario of Taiwan's first-ever
transition of power between different political parties in May 2000
as "a boat sailing in rough sea."</P>
      <P>According to excerpts of the new book released by the
Presidential Office Friday, Chen said he feels that the historic
transfer of power 18 months ago marked only a "symbolic" transfer of
power, rather than a total change of administration.</P>
      <P>Chen recalled that the National Security Council failed to
transfer its full archives and files and that the Presidential Office
staff and other administrative agencies were not very cooperative in
the transitional process.</P>
      <P>"At that monumental moment, I felt that I was like walking on a
tight rope and could afford any misstep," Chen said in the book
which recounts how he faced problems, met challenges and thought
about the future since taking the presidency.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT LEADER DISMISSES DPP ADMINISTRATION AS `INCOMPETENT'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 26 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian's perception of a
coalition proves the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
administration's "incompetence," "arrogance" and "ignorance of the
public well-being," opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Secretary-General Lin
Fong-cheng said Friday.</P>
      <P>He made the comment after Chen told the Associated Press earlier
in the day that his DPP party will not give up the leadership of the
coalition government he has promised to form after the Dec. 1
elections.</P>
      <P>The president said that his party will "share power with the
people" and consult with other parties in assembling the
administration, but the coalition will still be controlled by the
DPP.</P>
      <P>Noting that while political sleight of hand might work in
elections, it will not work in running the government, the KMT leader
said the problem with the DPP is its lack of administrators, and that
it cannot run the government without talent from other parties.</P>
      <P>But a coalition cannot be formed between parties without mutual
trust and Chen's interview, according to Lin, has exposed the
president's oblivion to the root problems within his current
government. Chen is condemned to repeating his errors in his next
administration, whether it is a coalition or not, Lin claimed.</P>
      <P>In light of his administration being blocked at every turn in the
opposition-controlled legislature, and because much of his agenda is
mired in political wangling between the ruling and opposition
parties, Chen has promised to change tack after the election by
putting together a coalition.</P>
      <P>The opposition, especially the KMT, which is the leading party in
the current legislature, has demanded that the president ask
whichever party controls the most seats in the legislature after the
election to form a coalition.</P>

(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
Secretary-General Lin Fong-cheng said Friday that the party's support
rate has increased following the recent move to revoke the party
membership of former Chairman Lee Teng-hui.</P>
      <P>Lin told reporters that Lee is "obviously" inclined toward
supporting Taiwan independence, a stance totally contrary to that of
the KMT.</P>
      <P>Therefore, he said, after his expulsion from the party, some
former party members have returned to the party. He added that the
results of various public opinion surveys also indicate that the
party's support rate is on the rise.</P>
      <P>Lee was expelled mainly because he stumped for the candidates of
the newly formed Taiwan Solidarity Union and criticized the KMT.</P>
      <P>Regarding the Dec. 1 legislative and county chief elections, Lin
said that the KMT has "absolute confidence" in its ability to
continue to be the biggest party in the 225-seat Legislative Yuan
after the elections.</P>
      <P>He said that the party's target is to win 90 seats, with a
possibility of reaching 100 seats.</P>
      <P>In the elections for the 23 county magistrates and city mayors,
he said the KMT might have a chance of winning in eight to 12
counties and cities.</P>
      <P>The KMT leader expressed the hope that the "pan-blue alliance" --
referring to the KMT, the People First Party and the New Party --
will cooperate in the elections.</P>
      <P>"Our country will have a bright hope only when the pan-blue
alliance cooperates to win in the elections and it will be a disaster
for the country if the DPP makes a gain," Lin claimed.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The consensus reached in an August economic
conference in Taiwan will bring positive effect in normalizing
relations between Taiwan and mainland China, Republic of China
government spokesman Su Tzen-ping said Friday.</P>
      <P>In an interview by Asiamedia, which belongs to the University of
California in Los Angeles, Su said that in the Economic Development
Advisory Conference (EDAC) held in August and initiated by President
Chen Shui-bian to boost Taiwan's flagging economy, a consensus was
made to adopt an "active opening, effective management" strategy
toward local investment in mainland China, instead of the present "no
haste, be patient" policy.</P>
      <P>Su said economic integration between Taiwan and mainland China
will "inevitably" turn into political integration, which is in
accordance with Chen's idea of "seeking a permanent peace between the
two sides of the Taiwan Strait starting with economic, trade, and
cultural integration between both sides."</P>
      <P>Su also noted that to prevent the frequent economic exchanges
between the two sides from affecting Taiwan's security and to further
protect Taiwan investment in mainland China, the ROC government will
establish a "national security net" to stabilize the mechanism of the
free market, allow for political democratization and advance the
national defenses.</P>
      <P>Referring to the imminent entry of both Taiwan and mainland China
into the World Trade Organization, Su said local industry will
benefit in production and trade, although he admitted that certain
sectors, such as agriculture and low-tech industry, will bear the
brunt of the impact.</P>
      <P>However, Su added, Taiwan's industries have been readjusting
toward WTO regulations for a long time, and he predicted that they
will be able to withstand the impact.</P>

      <P>Domestic airlines can "apply" to the
Cabinet to fly through mainland Chinese airspace on flights that
originally crossed Afghanistan, Premier Chang Chun-hsiung said
Friday.</P>
      <P>Chang made the remark at the Legislative Yuan while fielding
questions by opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator Lee Hsien-jung as
to why the government was still refusing to allow local carriers to
take advantage of an offer by Beijing to allow mainland overflights
in order to avoid the dangerous skies over Afghanistan.</P>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan recently passed a resolution asking the
government to allow domestic airlines to use mainland airspace after
Beijing offered to allow local carriers into its territory, but the
Cabinet has refused to comply, saying such a move would have to be
discussed by government officials of both sides.</P>
      <P>Lee blasted the two government departments concerned -- the
Mainland Affairs Council and the Ministry of Transportation and
Communications -- for their failure to decide on the issue.</P>
      <P>Chang said only that airlines can "apply" to fly over the

promulgated in September 1992.</P>
      <P>He added that Taiwan and mainland China have not signed any air

    <HEADLINE>ROC PRESIDENT DECRIES BEIJING'S REJECTION OF TAIWAN'S APEC PROXY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 27 (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Friday night
that Beijing's refusal to welcome his appointed proxy to attend last
weekend's Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) leadership summit
in Shanghai was tantamount to "a rejection of the people of Taiwan."</P>
      <P>While in northern Taiwan's Miaoli County to stump for ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) candidates in the Dec. 1
legislative, county chief and city mayor elections, Chen said that
Taiwan's choice of a presidential representative to the annual APEC
summit "is not a decision for the Communist Chinese to make."</P>
      <P>He said that it was also not a decision that mainland Chinese
President Jiang Zemin could make on behalf of Taiwan and that
refusing to let former Republic of China Vice President Li Yuan-zu
participate in the regional forum was the same as brushing aside a
decision made by the 23 million people of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, to expound on the president's comments Friday in an
interview with Associated Press Television News that his
determination to promote Taipei-Beijing relations will not be
affected by any factors, Mainland Affairs Council Vice Chairman Chen
Ming-tong said Saturday that the government's policy toward mainland
China is flexible, dynamic and in pace with the times.</P>
      <P>Chen said in a speech to the public that although some people
criticize the DPP administration for not having clear mainland policy
guidelines like the previous administration's Guidelines for National
Unification, the government in fact follows the practice of having
the president deliver policy speeches or of having a representative
group reach consensus on relevant issues at various important
junctures.</P>
      <P>He reiterated that Taiwan has the sincerity and good will to
communicate with mainland China but that Beijing must first accept
the existence of the Republic of China.</P>

    <HEADLINE>RETIRED AGENT ANALYZES DECLINE IN INTELLIGENCE FROM MAINLAND</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  27  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A retired Taiwan intelligence agent said
Saturday that the issue of ideology is one of the major reasons
behind a decline in intelligence from mainland China.</P>
      <P>The former official with the Military Intelligence Bureau (MIB),
who preferred to remain anonymous, was commenting on remarks by
President Chen Shui-bian in his soon-to-be-published book that
intelligence from mainland China has decreased significantly since he
assumed office in the Republic of China's first-ever transition of
power between different political parties in May 2000.</P>
      <P>In the past, the former MIB agent said, the most effective way to
recruit mainland Chinese people to work for the bureau was to
persuade them to "provide intelligence and information for the sake
of eventual reunification of the two sides of the Taiwan Strait."</P>
      <P>"As Chen's Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) used to espouse
Taiwan independence," he said, "some mainland intelligence agents
have become reluctant to risk their lives to work for Taiwan after
the inauguration of the DPP government."</P>
      <P>The ex-official, who was in charge of mainland intelligence
during his 30-plus years of service with the MIB before his
retirement last year, recalled that some senior MIB agents also
applied for retirement after the DPP took the helm of the nation.</P>
      <P>"They intended to leave the MIB because they were unused to
working for a non-Kuomintang government made up of what had been an
outlawed group -- the pro-independence DPP," he said. To his
knowledge, he added, high-ranking MIB officials had made strenuous
efforts to convince them to remain in their posts.</P>
      <P>The ex-military agent said President Chen's complaint about the
dwindling amount of mainland intelligence is really an alarm.
According to him, it has truly become more difficult to develop an
intelligence network in mainland China since Chen assumed the ROC
presidency.</P>
      <P>The former MIB official further said another reason for the
decline in mainland intelligence is that mainland China has stepped
up its anti-espionage campaign and has refrained from publishing or
circulating sensitive documents in order to better protect their
military secrets.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The United States will continue to be
supportive of Taiwan's representation in Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) meetings in accordance with past practices, a U.S.
State Department official said Friday.</P>
      <P>C. Lawrence Greenwood, a senior official for APEC, said at a
morning briefing hosted by the Asia Society that Taiwan's absence at
this year's APEC informal leadership summit in Shanghai was
"regrettable".</P>
      <P>He termed it regrettable because Taiwan in the past has played "a
very valuable and positive role" at APEC summits, adding that he
believes Taiwan will continue to play such a role in the future.</P>
      <P>Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian announced Oct. 19 that
because of the mainland Chinese government's failure to follow the
established APEC protocol of sending a special envoy to present an
invitation to the ROC president to attend the informal leadership
summit, Taiwan would not attend the summit in Shanghai.</P>
      <P>In response to a question concerning the issue of Taiwan
representation at APEC summits in the future, Greenwood said that "we
look forward to working very closely with all APEC members."</P>
      <P>He pointed out that the United States has always been very
supportive of Taiwan's representation in accordance with past
practices, adding that "we will continue to be supportive in this
way."</P>

      <P>The U.S. Department of Defense
announced Friday the proposed sale of 40 JAVELIN anti-tank missile
systems to Taiwan at an estimated cost of $51 million.</P>
      <P>If the U.S. Congress approves the sale as expected, this will

China's anti-armor arsenal.</P>
      <P>In a press release, the Defense Security Cooperation Agency said
the sale would consist of 40 JAVELIN command launch units, 360
missile rounds, as well as simulators, and support equipment and
services.</P>
      <P>The agency said the systems would enhance Taiwan's medium-range
anti-tank capability, adding that the transfer would also provide
Taiwan with "a strong anti-landing capability and would increase
inter-operability with U.S. forces".</P>
      <P>With a range of approximately 2,500 meters, JAVELIN is equipped

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government demonstrated its full
preparedness for a biochemical terrorist attack by staging an
exercise at a Taipei subway station Saturday, mobilizing over 1,000
military, police, medical and environmental protection personnel.</P>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung said after overseeing the 90-minute
drill that the primary objectives were to test the government's
emergency response capability, to sensitize the public to biochemical
terrorist threats and to familiarize them with the necessary measures
to take in the event of such an emergency in order to minimize
injuries.</P>
      <P>He instructed all government agencies that took part in the
exercise to immediately evaluate any problems that arose during the
drill in order to rectify such oversights in the future.</P>
      <P>Saturday's drill was the culmination of two previous rehearsals
held Thursday and last Friday that were designed to work out the
kinks in advance of the official exercise.</P>
      <P>All three exercises began with a mock terrorist releasing an
unknown toxic gas in the passenger compartment of a subway train at
the Hsiaonanmen Station of the Taipei Mass Rapid Transit system.</P>
      <P>In charge of organizing the exercise, Environmental Protection
Administration (EPA) head Hau Lung-bin said that the government
selected the location out of concern that terrorists might choose to
carry out biochemical attacks in transportation hubs and public
places with high concentrations of people.</P>
      <P>During the exercise, while mock commuters frothing at the mouth
dropped to the ground and noxious gases continued to spread, alarmed
station personnel called in the cavalry.</P>
      <P>Immediately, police arrived and cordoned off the area, and EPA
personnel sealed the air ducts to the subway.</P>
      <P>An evacuation was carried out, and medical personnel promptly
began attending to the victims.</P>
      <P>Emergency teams from the Department of Health and soldiers from
the chemical warfare branch of the military's Sixth Field Army also
rushed to the scene and began identifying and neutralizing chemical
agents, sterilizing the entire station and the subway train.</P>
      <P>On Monday, President Chen Shui-bian had urged relevant government
agencies to heighten their level of alertness against all possible
forms of terrorist biochemical warfare and to take effective steps to
help enhance public awareness of the anthrax threat.</P>
      <P>Chen gave the directives after presiding over a fourth high-level
national security meeting regarding the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in
the United States.</P>
      <P>In addition to staging drills and intensifying the campaign to
inform the public, he said, the government should start evaluating
and planning vaccine purchases and supply sources.</P>

    <HEADLINE>HIGH SCHOOL GRADS TO HAVE MULTIPLE CHANNELS TO ENTER UNIVERSITY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  27  (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Starting in the 2002 academic year, high
school students in Taiwan will have more channels to enter the
university or college department of their own choice as the Education
Ministry puts into force a reform multiple university entrance
program.</P>
      <P>A spokesman of the Education Ministry announced Friday that in
the 2002 academic year, 12 percent of freshmen will be selected from
high schools' recommendation lists, 13 percent will be chosen from
among individual applications, and 75 percent will be selected from
among those choosing the conventional method of attending the
university joint entrance examination.</P>
      <P>The spokesman said that while all departments of the 143
universities and colleges will select their students mainly from the
joint entrance examination, 347 departments will accept school
recommendations as well as individual applicants, seven will only
accept individual applicants, and five only school recommendations.</P>
      <P>The multiple-channel approach has been in practice on a trial
basis for the past few years, with the participating departments
usually accepting only a limited number of students from
recommendation lists or individual applications. In addition to the
qualification requirements, these departments have conducted separate
tests or interviews, with applicants having to prove their special
qualities, language abilities or unique academic working plans in
order to be accepted by the departments.</P>
      <P>Those who plan to enter a university for the academic year
beginning in 2002 via the school recommendation list or individual
application channels are required to take a high school graduate
examination in February, with their performance on the exam to be an
important reference for the screening committees.</P>
      <P>As most university departments will use the conventional method
to select the majority of their new students, most high school
graduates are expected to attend the university joint entrance
examination next July.</P>
      <P>The multiple-channel program is considered by those in education
circles to be a great breakthrough in terms of Taiwan's education
reform, with universities and colleges being able to attract students
interested in specific subjects that they offer on the one hand, and
high school graduates being offered more opportunities and choices on
the other, the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>The new mechanism will also provide advantages to students with
special talents or qualifications, he added.</P>

      <P>The chairman of Taiwan Semiconductor
Manufacturing Corp. (TSMC) said Friday that it is still too early for

small over the next two to three years and that it would not be easy

the third quarter of 2001 reached NT$26.9 billion, down 43.3 percent
from the same period the previous year, while the company's
third-quarter net income totaled NT$1.2 billion, down 93.8 percent.</P>
      <P>Chang said that the prospects for the semiconductor sector will

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  27  (CNA)
(By David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The issue of Taiwan jetliners flying
through mainland Chinese airspace is still a "hot potato" for the
government, despite Premier Chang Chung-hsiung expressing Friday that
domestic carriers can apply to the Cabinet for mainland overflights.</P>
      <P>Chang said Friday at the Legislative Yuan that domestic airlines
can apply to the Executive Yuan for permission to fly through
mainland airspace on their routes that had passed through Afghan
airspace.</P>
      <P>He made the remark while fielding a question by opposition
Kuomintang Legislator Lee Hsien-jung as to why the government is
still refusing to allow domestic carriers to take advantage of an
offer by Beijing to allow mainland overflights in order to avoid the
dangerous skies over Afghanistan.</P>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan recently passed a resolution asking the
government to allow domestic airlines to use mainland Chinese
airspace after Beijing offered to allow Taiwan carriers to do so, but
the Cabinet has refused to comply, saying that such a move would have
to be discussed by government officials from both sides of the Taiwan
Strait.</P>
      <P>Deng Chen-chung, vice chairman of the Cabinet-level Mainland
Affairs Council (MAC), said Saturday that Beijing has until now only
verbally consented to allowing Taiwan carriers to fly through its
airspace without further expression of an intent to negotiate with
Taipei on the issue.</P>
      <P>He said now that both Beijing and Taipei claim that "the ball is
in the other's court," it is impossible for domestic carriers to fly
through mainland Chinese airspace at present.</P>

feasibility of Taiwan carriers' using mainland airspace, adding that

    <HEADLINE>U.S. THINK TANK FORESEES POSSIBILITY OF WAR IN TAIWAN STRAIT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Oct.  26  (CNA)
(By Jay Chen and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China is likely to attack
Taiwan in the next five to 10 years because it is worried about the
"de-Sinonization" trend in Taiwan in recent years, according to a
report released by a U.S. think tank Friday.</P>
      <P>The report, issued by the National Bureau of Asian Research, said
mainland China's fretting over Taiwan-U.S. relations, Japan-U.S.
relations and new U.S. defense strategy would also enhance the
possibility of mainland China using force against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Noting that the issue regarding reunification of the two sides of
the Taiwan Strait is critical to the Communist Chinese regime's
survival, the report said this reality has made it even more
difficult to deter mainland China from invading Taiwan.</P>
      <P>For the Chinese Communists, the report said, their regime's
survival is far more important than national economic prosperity.</P>
      <P>The report also pointed out that two other factors have made
mainland China more likely to resort to the use of force against
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>First, the report said, mainland China's goal is mainly to
intimidate Taiwan not to move toward de jure independence rather than
to control the island. As a result, the report said, it would be
relatively easier for mainland China to achieve its military aims.</P>
      <P>Second, the report said if Beijing were to think that political
and military developments in Taiwan, the United States and in other
U.S. allies in the Asia-Pacific region were making the so-called
Taiwan issue more difficult to resolve, mainland China would be more
likely to resort to military intimidation.</P>
      <P>The report further said three factors would enhance the
possibility of mainland China using force against Taiwan -- namely
Beijing underestimating Taiwan's and the United States' determination
to defend the island; Beijing believing that if the United States
were involved in a conflict in another part of the world, it would be
less likely to involve itself in a Taiwan Strait conflict; and

alienate the United States from its regional allies.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the report said Beijing would like to see incumbent

    <HEADLINE>GOV'T OFFICIAL ADVOCATES INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  27 (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's traffic-related problems such as
congestion, accidents and air pollution can be alleviated only
through the adoption of an intelligent transportation system (ITS), a
Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC) researcher said
Saturday.</P>
      <P>Chen Yi-chang, combined technology planner at the Transportation
Research Institute, said at an ITS development seminar that the new
system makes better use of technological advances in information
gathering, telecommunication networks, traffic control and vehicle
design to maximize the efficiency of the existing resources.</P>
      <P>It is not feasible to try to solve traffic problems by building
more roads, Chen said. The number of vehicles vying for space on the
island's saturated roads has grown by 60 percent in the past nine
years to a whopping 16.99 million against 51 percent for the total
surface area available for automotive transportation, he added.
Taiwan's surface area totals 36,000 square kilometers.</P>
      <P>Those figures work out to about 472 vehicles per square
kilometer. "And that number is rising," Chen said, "and all this
contributes to excessive fuel waste and the mounting problem of air
pollution."</P>
      <P>Traffic accident casualties including deaths and injuries number
more than 6,000 persons a year, according to police statistics. The
top cause of the mishaps was "improper driving."</P>
      <P>Through a systematic collection and analysis of traffic data,
Chen said, useful and timely information can be provided for
motorists as well as the operators and supervisors of public
transportation systems.</P>
      <P>The system would give operators an up-to-date picture of traffic
conditions so that they could effectively adjust the scheduling and
route assignment of their fleet of vehicles, while regulating the use
of roads by encouraging drivers to avoid congested sections and
traffic hours, Chen pointed out.</P>
      <P>Chen said that his institute is working together with the MOTC
Technology Advisory Department to develop a national ITS that is
expected to reach demonstration stage in 2002. The ITS is scheduled
for completion by 2005, he added.</P>
      <P>The Transportation Research Insititute is in charge of developing
the following ITS systems:</P>
      <P>- Advanced transportation management.</P>
      <P>- Electronic toll collection system for the freeways.</P>
      <P>- Advanced travel information.</P>
      <P>- Emergency response.</P>
      <P>- Advanced mass transportation.</P>
      <P>- Commercial vehicle operations.</P>
      <P>- Advanced vehicle control and safety.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER URGES PUBLIC FUNCTIONARIES TO REMAIN 'NEUTRAL'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Oct.   27  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung Saturday
cautioned government employees against getting involved in any form
of election campaigning.</P>
      <P>Chang told a "National Development Seminar" in Taipei the public
functionaries should remain "neutral," while candidates are stumping
across Taiwan in the run-up to the year-end elections.</P>
      <P>Legislators, county magistrates and city mayors will be elected
on the first day of December.</P>
      <P>"All 600,000 public servants," Chang said, "should refrain
from compromising their strictly neutral stance vis-a-vis the
elections." Only by doing do so, he added, can they serve as a
"clean stabilizing force of the nation."</P>
      <P>The premier said the government employees sometimes have to "go
out of" their way to help victims of natural disasters. "Don't stick
to red tape all the time," he warned.</P>
      <P>He compared the red tape-induced official lethargy with the
whole-hearted assistance the military and charity organizations, the
Buddhist Tzu Chi Compassionate Relief Association in particular, gave
the victims of such natural disasters as the Great Earthquake of
September 21, 1999.</P>
      <P>"The public has been greatly impressed by the good work they
did," he said.</P>
      <P>Compared with the good reputation enjoyed by the military and
Tzu Chi, Chang said, the public servants are considered "cold
and conservative." "The people expect their officials to do just as
well," he pointed out.</P>
      <P>Chang said the public functionaries have made "efforts" to
live up to that expectation. However, he added, whatever progress
has been made is still not enough. He stressed the public servants
must act to change the image that the government is incompetent.

    <HEADLINE>TRANSFER OF POWER TO DPP PROCEEDED SMOOTHLY: LIN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Oct.   27  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The transition of power from the
Kuomintang to the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) proceeded
smoothly, a top aide to former President Lee Teng-hui said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Lin Pi-chao, deputy secretary-general to the Kuomintang
President, denied that the power transition in May last year was
"turbulent."</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian describes the historic shift of power as
"turbulent" in his new book, which will come off the press next week.
Excerpts of the book were made available Friday in a Presidential
Office release.
 "I was surprised by Chen's characterization," said Lin, a key
member of the Kuomintang government's transition team. "As a matter
of fact," he pointed out, "it proceeded very smoothly."</P>
      <P>Lee Teng-hui wanted a smooth transition, Lin said.</P>
      <P>"Lee ordered Ding Mou-shih, then secretary-general of the
National Security Council, to organize a special team to ensure a
smooth transfer of power," Lin said.</P>
      <P>"In preparation for the monumental shift of power," Lin recalled,
"Ding held many rounds of talks with Chang Chun-hsiung, head of
Chen's transition team, on relevant work and arrangements."</P>
      <P>Chang, the incumbent premier, did not express any dissatisfaction
over the conduct of the transition, Lin said. "To the best of my
understanding," he pointed out, "Chang was not dissatisfied."</P>
      <P>The Chen book is titled: "The First Voyage of the Century."</P>
      <P>According to the book, the transition of power was fraught with
danger. It is compared to a voyage in "turbulent seas."</P>
      <P>In particular, President Chen accuses the National Security
Council (NSC) of failing to hand over its dossier. He claims he is
in total darkness about the NSC's work and problems.</P>
      <P>Worse still, Chen charges in the book, his inherited staff was
not cooperative in the early days of his Presidency. Cabiet agencies
have faced the same problem, he adds.</P>
      <P>The President recalls he was convinced that the transition would
be full of uncertainty. He doubted if the power would be turned over
peacefully and if he could be sworn in at all.</P>
      <P>Neither the DPP nor the Kuomintang had any experience in power
transfer, Chen writes.</P>

    <HEADLINE>POLL FINDS BEIJING'S RUDENESS AT APEC WILL AFFECT CROSS-STRAIT TIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  27  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Many local people think that mainland
China's rudeness toward Taiwan at a recent regional meeting would
adversely affect relations across the Taiwan Strait, according to the
results of an opinion poll released Saturday.</P>
      <P>The telephone survey of 1,120 randomly chosen adult residents
was conducted from Oct. 24-26 by Gallup public opinion research
center at the request Sanlih Entertainment Television.</P>
      <P>Nearly 70 percent of survey respondents said they thought that
mainland Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan's rudeness toward the
Republic of China representative at a news conference held after a
ministerial meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)
forum would have a negative impact on future cross-strait relations.
But 17 percent thought otherwise.</P>
      <P>Poll results also showed that 48 percent of those interviewed
were dissatisfied with the ROC government's handling of the APEC
event, while 30 percent approved of the government's performance.</P>
      <P>Despite Beijing's refusal to allow President Chen Shui-bian's
proxy, former Vice President Li Yuan-zu, to attend this year's APEC
summit in Shanghai, 45.8 percent of the respondents still said they
support the proposal to ease restrictions on mainland China-bound
investment. In contrast, 30 percent said they oppose the proposal.</P>
      <P>Asked about future cross-strait relations, 28 percent said they
agree to the Beijing-proposed "one country, two systems" unification
scheme, but 35 percent gave a thumbs-down to the overture.</P>
      <P>According to survey findings, the APEC fiasco is not expected to
have a significant impact on the Dec. 1 elections for legislators,
city mayors and county magistrates.</P>
      <P>Only 25.4 percent said they think that Beijing's bullying of
Taiwan at the APEC meeting would help the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) draw "sympathy votes" in the upcoming polls.</P>
      <P>In comparison, 26.5 percent said they think that the APEC
incident would help benefit the main opposition Kuomintang in the
year-end polls.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 17 percent said they believe that the opposition
People First Party would also benefit from the DPP government's APEC
fiasco. And 12.9 percent said they don't think that any political
party would benefit from the APEC incident.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taoyuan, Oct. 27 (CNA)
(By David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Vice President Lien Chan said Saturday
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) is to blame for
Taiwan's economic slump.</P>
      <P>Lien, chairman of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT), told an
election campaign rally here the current economic downturn
started with the suspension of a nuclear power station project
in October last year. The stock market turned bearish at the same
time, he added.</P>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung announced the suspension a year ago
today, Lien said. The former vice president appeared at the
rally to stump for Chu Lih-lun, who is running for magistrate of
Taoyuan County, and KMT Parliamentary nominees.</P>
      <P>Legislators, county magistrates and city mayors will be elected
on December 1.</P>
      <P>"October 27," Lien said, "should be designated as Day of
Suffering for the Taiwan Economy." The people had to pay for a
NT$3.1 billion loss caused by the suspension of the Fourth Nuclear
Power Plant project, he charged, adding that investors have lost NT$6
trillion in the past 12 months.</P>
      <P>"For all this the DPP is to blame," Lien pointed out.</P>
      <P>He blasted the DPP for failure to make the economy grow by more
than five percent a year as it had promised at the beginning of
President Chen Shui-bian's administration. "The economy is expected
to register a negative growth this year," he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CROSS-STRAIT SEA-AIR TRANSSHIPMENT  RESULTS  LOWER  THAN  EXPECTED: AIRLINES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  28 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>More than two months after direct sea and
air transshipment services across the Taiwan Strait were formally
implemented, two major Taiwan airlines reported that increases in
their cargo delivery volumes have been lower than expected.</P>
      <P>EVA Airways had originally expected that its volume of cargo
deliveries would increase by 1,000 tons per month in the short term
following the start of direct cross-strait sea and air transshipment
services before reaching as high as 4,000 tons per month in the
middle- to long-term.</P>
      <P>EVA didn't give the exact figure but admitted that the volume of
cargo deliveries has been lower than expected, especially after the
Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in the United States. It is understood
that the figure for the two-month-plus period is around 200 tons.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, China Airlines reported that the volume of its cargo
deliveries via cross-strait sea and air transshipment services
totaled only around 70 tons for the same period. The maximum carrying
capacity of a single Boeing 747-400 cargo plane is 120 tons.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Transportation and Communications had said, based
on airline operator estimates, that the implementation of direct
cross-strait transshipment services could create around NT$12 billion
(US$345.82 million) in business opportunities.</P>
      <P>Although the airline operators said that results have been less
than ideal so far, they expressed enthusiasm for the government's
policy.</P>
      <P>The Republic of China decided to expand the functions of its
Kaohsiung offshore cross-strait transshipment center to cover
airborne transshipment services, thereby dramatically cutting the
time for cargo deliveries from the mainland.</P>
      <P>The first shipment of cargo directly from mainland China to be
transshipped via Taiwan came from Xiamen, Fujian Province, on board a
Taiwan-based vessel of Uniglory Marine Corp. on Aug. 15 before being
transported by air to Europe from Kaohsiung's offshore transshipment
center.</P>
      <P>Both Uniglory Marine and EVA Airways are affiliates of Taiwan's
Evergreen Group, which operates the world's largest container
shipping fleet.</P>
      <P>Under the direct cross-strait air and sea transshipment services
mechanism, cargo arriving at Kaohsiung from Fuzhou or Xiamen in
mainland China is transported to Kaohsiung Airport or CKS
International Airport in northern Taiwan to be transported by air to
a third country.</P>
      <P>Currently, mainland Chinese goods to be transshipped to a third
country via Kaohsiung can neither clear customs nor enter Taiwan
proper.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NEW SPAT ERUPTS BETWEEN PRESIDENT AND VICE PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Oct.   28  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The smoldering differences between
President Chen Shui-bien and Vice President Annette Lu again came
into the open this weekend with Chen insinuating that Lu had
overstepped her role as his lieutenant and Lu denying the charge.</P>
      <P>In an advanced copy of the new book about Chen's first 500 days
in office, President Chen says that according to the ROC
Constitution, the vice president, instead of sharing the powers of
the head of state, has a different and separate job from that of the
president. Chen was quoted by anonymous academics as having said that
Lu has acted more like a "semi-president" rather than as a vice
president.</P>
      <P>In the new book, scheduled to hit newsstands Wednesday, Chen
supported his view by quoting former President Lee Teng-hui as
warning him against letting his vice president in on offical
memorandumns, calling the practice "governmental protocol."</P>
      <P>Furthermore, Chen said he had consulted former Vice President Li
Yuan-zu about the proper role of vice president and was told by Li
that "a vice president is nothing more than a vice president" and
that this view was the secret for his amicable ties with then
President Lee Teng-hui during Li's six-year stint as vice president.</P>
      <P>Li was billed as "a person with no voice" in Taipei political
circles because of his refraining from airing personal views in
public and therefore staying clear of controversy.</P>
      <P>Military leaders expressed their displeasure with President Chen
when he let Lu join him in overseeing military exercises and in
inspecting military units, saying that "there is a commander in chief
of armed forces but no deputy commander in chief" under the
constitution, according to Chen.</P>
      <P>Chen said that he believes that Lu will gradually come to know
what her role is under the Constitution and play it accordingly in
the future.</P>
      <P>The president said he has expressed his views in support of both
men and women running the state, adding that he chose Lu as his
running mate in the 2000 presidential election on the strong
recommendation of his wife Wu Shu-chen despite warnings by others
that Lu is an abrasive person and hard to get along with.</P>
      <P>Hours after the contents of Chen's book were made public, Lu
issued a statement through her office late Saturday arguing that she
had never overstepped her authority.</P>
      <P>The vice president, who studied law at National Taiwan University
and Harvard University, said she has "a considerable grasp of the
constitution" and is confident that she has never acted beyond her
authority and has always given Chen her utmost respect.</P>
      <P>If she has ever appeared to have upstaged the president in
public, she said, it has been for a good and proper reason, pointing
to the example of her inspection of disaster areas in the wake of the
recent typhoons that ravaged the island and the necessity of coming
to the aid of victims who have suffered from repeated natural
disasters.</P>
      <P>Noting that the year-end elections are drawing near, Lu said she
prefers to reserve her opinions about the new book's other
controversial parts concerning her lest a public spat between herself
and Chen jeopardize the election chances of the Democratic
Progressive Party candidates.</P>
      <P>Lu in her statement praised Chen's ideas concerning both men and
women running the country but seemed to disagree with Chen's views
about the role of the vice president.</P>
      <P>Sunday's China Times quoted the Republic of China's first female
vice president as saying that Li Yuan-zu was branded a voiceless man
by Lee Teng-hui when Lee explained to the country his choice of Li as
his running mate.</P>
      <P>Lu told the paper that Li never called himself a voiceless man
except for once in public, although he did do many things for the
country while in office, not to mention Li's successor who doubled as
premier for two years.</P>
      <P>The outspoken vice president is often at odds with Chen, with the
Latest example being Lu's criticism of Chen's choice of envoy to
represent him at the recent Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
informal leadership summit in Shanghai.</P>
      <P>Lu said in an interview with a local magazine Wednesday that
Chen's misunderstandings of the international situation led to
Beijing's rejection of Li Yuan-zu as Chen's personal envoy to the
summit, an allegation immediately denied by Chen's office.</P>
      <P>Calling Lu's remarks "misleading and regrettable," the
President's Office said in a statement that the APEC informal
leadership summit fiasco was caused by Beijing's attempts to
undermine the island's status in the international arena rather than
by miscalculations by the ROC government.</P>

      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party's

Taiwan's WTO entry before its goes into a one-month recess beginning
Nov. 1.</P>
      <P>The Legislature will go into recess because of the scheduled Dec.

the bills related to Taiwan's WTO accession before the next session
commences Dec. 2.</P>
      <P>Tsai said he hopes that despite the time pressures, the 14
WTO-related bills, 9 of which still have to undergo deliberation by
the legislature, will be passed before the end of this month.</P>

    <HEADLINE>OVER HALF OF TAIPEI RESIDENTS APPROVE OF RECRUITING SYSTEM: POLL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  28  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Slightly over half of Taipei residents
approve a military recruiting system, although most think the system
may result in insufficient numbers of military personnel, according
to the results of a survey released Sunday.</P>
      <P>The results of the poll, conducted between Oct. 17-19 on Taipei
residents over the age of 18, were announced by Yok Mu-ming, a New
Party (NP) candidate in the Dec. 1 legislative elections.</P>
      <P>The survey showed that 50.1 percent of respondents said they
approve of the recruitment system, while 42.1 said they are against
it.</P>
      <P>Those who said they favor the idea of military personnel
streamlining in order to reduce national defense expenditures and put
the resulting savings toward economic construction and social welfare
was 58.3 percent, while those who said they are against the idea was
31.9 percent.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT CHEN TOUTS TAIWAN'S ADVANTAGE OVER MAINLAND CHINA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  27  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China is no match for Taiwan in
both democracy and economic competitiveness, President Chen Shui-bian
said in Kaohsiung Friday.</P>
      <P>In an attempt to stem the exodus of Taiwan's enterprises to
mainland China, President Chen urged his countrymen not to buy claims
that mainland China is better than Taiwan in terms of doing business.</P>
      <P>Quoting a Financial Times survey, Chen said mainland China lagged
far behind Taiwan in overall competitiveness, personnel quality, the
number of skilled workers and resources, not to mention the island's
sound democracy which has seen the first peaceful power transition in
the country's history.</P>
      <P>Chen cited another survey, "Global Competitiveness Report
2000-2001," as ranking Taiwan fifth on the list of the world's best
areas in terms of economic prospects and competitiveness, ahead of
Hong Kong, South Korea, Japan and the United Kingdom. In the survey
by the Geneva-based World Economic Forum, the People's Republic of
China came in 39th place and was expected to remain on the spot in
the next five years.</P>
      <P>In respect of scientific development, Taiwan ranked fourth
against 52nd for mainland China, Chen told an annual conference of
the Tainan Association.</P>
      <P>"All these surveys debunk widespread claims that mainland China
is a place better than Taiwan for doing business," Chen pointed out.</P>
      <P>Although there is always room for improvement in Taiwan's
investment climate, Chen said, "our people should never lose faith in
our own country."</P>
      <P>President Chen said he told the Associated Press in an interview
Friday he would ask President Jiang Zemin of the People's Republic of
China two questions, if and when they ever meet.</P>
      <P>One of the questions, Chen said, was why followers of the Falun
Gong spiritual movement can preach their belief freely in Taiwan but
are forbidden to do so on the Chinese mainland. The other question
was: Will China follow in Taiwan's footsteps in democracy, allowing
different political parties to govern in turn?</P>
      <P>Chen said he posed the latter question to stress that Taiwan is a
full-fledged democracy. Democracy is Taiwan's proudest achievement,
he told the Associated Press.</P>
      <P>"In democracy as well as economic potentiality," Chen pointed
out, "China isn't our match at all."</P>
      <P>He repeated his call for a higher government efficiency by
halving the seats of the Legislative Yuan. The Executive Yuan
(Cabinet) agencies should be reduced by a third, he said.</P>

citizen; when he regards them as dirt and grass.</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>EXPERT WARNS OF INCREASED COMPETITION, DISPUTES FOLLOWING WTO ENTRY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  29   (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Although both Taiwan and mainland China
hope for new trade and investment links following their imminent
World Trade Organization (WTO) accession, a local expert warned
Sunday of fiercer competition and increased trade friction between
the two sides.</P>
      <P>Tien Chun-mei, head of the Mainland Chinese Economic Affairs
Department under the Chung-Hua Institution for Economic Research,
told CNA that two-way relations will be "cooperative and competitive"
in the future and that Taiwan must take measures to tackle the
challenge amid a brand-new trade and commerce relationship between
the two sides.</P>
      <P>As the government decided to adopt the "active opening, efficient
management" policy to replace the "no haste, be patient" policy
governing mainland-bound investment by Taiwan business after the
Economic Development Advisory Conference in August, Tien said Taiwan
is set to further open up its market while its WTO accession
approaches.</P>
      <P>According to Tien, Taiwan will face stronger pressure from
mainland China's agricultural imports, an influx of mainland Chinese
capital and growing Taiwan investment in mainland China after the
island joins the WTO.</P>
      <P>In view of the delicate situation between the two sides, Tien
urged the government to take precautions especially against the
expected inflows of investment from mainland China as he said it is
very possible Beijing will use its investment in Taiwan as a tool to
manipulate the island's economy and financial market.</P>
      <P>To effectively regulate the movements of mainland Chinese capital
in the Taiwan market, Tien said the government must start with
reforming the local financial system and improving its monitoring
mechanisms.</P>
      <P>At a time when political hostilities still exist between the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait, Tien proposed that the government
prohibit mainland capital from being invested in Taiwan's
infrastructure, media, hi-tech and financial sectors.</P>
      <P>Tien said that the government must have the ability to react
swiftly to market developments and that an official mechanism to
monitor capital movements should be set up immediately.</P>
      <P>At the same time, trade friction between Taiwan and mainland
China will also increase after the two sides enter the WTO, the
economist warned. He said he was also skeptical about whether
bilateral trade disputes can be resolved through normal procedures
set by the WTO.</P>
      <P>From Taiwan's point of view, future cross-strait trade, commerce
and investment disputes should be settled through WTO channels, Tien
said. But he pointed out that mainland China may not be willing to do
so out of fear that a "country-to-country relationship" would be
established between Taiwan and the mainland under the WTO framework.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, some Taiwan companies may be forced to move out of
Taiwan in search of lower production costs, fueling a fresh wave of
exodus by local businesses to mainland China and creating a
"clustering phenomenon of Taiwan investors" there, he said.</P>
      <P>According to Tien, Taiwan must efficiently upgrade its industrial
levels with an international outlook to fend off the "economic
magnetism" of mainland China, which he said is sparing no efforts to
lure greater Taiwan investment.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC NOT YET DECIDED ON USING WTO EXCLUSION PRINCIPLE AGAINST M'LAND</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  29  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan has not yet decided whether to
employ the "exclusion provision" against mainland China after its
impending accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO), sources
from the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) reported Monday.</P>
      <P>According to WTO regulations, a member is allowed to exclude
another member from open market treatment under special conditions.</P>
      <P>Since both mainland China and Taiwan have not yet been formally
admitted to the WTO, the MOEA said it sees no rush in declaring
Taiwan's stance on the matter at the moment, ministry officials said.</P>
      <P>Economic Affairs Minister Lin Hsin-yi said Taiwan will wait until
the last minute to make known its decision on the "exclusion
provision" issue on the grounds that there is the possibility that
Beijing might use its political clout to interfere with Taiwan's WTO
entry.</P>
      <P>Vice Economic Affairs Minister Chen Ruey-long noted that the
issue of whether Taiwan would employ the WTO's "exclusion provision"
to deal with its post-WTO accession trade and economic ties with
mainland China is currently under intensive assessment by high-level
officials, adding that the government will make a decision based on
the best interests of the nation at the most "appropriate time."</P>
      <P>According to WTO regulations, Chen said, if Taiwan decides to
employ the "exclusion provision" against mainland China, it must put
forth the proposal to the WTO Secretariat before the fourth WTO
ministerial meeting is held in Qatar Nov. 9-13, during which mainland
China's and Taiwan's WTO accession will be the centerpiece of
discussions.</P>
      <P>Chen added that Taipei will make the final decision on the
"exclusion provision" issue before Nov. 9.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, in response to a local daily newspaper report Monday
that Taiwan will not employ the "exclusion provision" against
mainland China after the island is admitted into the WTO, officials
from the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) said related
government agencies have not yet made any decision on the matter.</P>
      <P>MAC officials said the Republic of China government is more than
willing to engage in any form of goodwill interactions with mainland
China under the WTO framework and attaches great expectations to the
conducting of bilateral economic and trade exchanges based on the
principles of reciprocity and equality.</P>
      <P>Taiwan should have no need to use the "exclusion provision"
against mainland China if the two sides can engage in benign
interactions, MAC officials added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Wu Rong-I, president of the private think-tank Taiwan
Institute of Economic Research, called for the government Monday to
handle carefully strategies related to Taiwan's WTO accession.</P>
      <P>Wu said if Taiwan refrains from employing the "exclusion
provision" against mainland China, the island should open its entire
market to all mainland China-originating agricultural products,
adding that it is a big question mark whether Taiwan's agricultural
sector could stand the impact.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Wu pointed out, mainland China promised to endorse a
"defending provision" when it began to conduct WTO bilateral talks,
indicating that within the first 12 years of its formal WTO
membership, mainland China would agree to the employing of the
"defending provision" by any member of the WTO if that member country
found that imports of mainland Chinese products had exerted too great
an impact on its domestic industries and consequently caused great
losses to its people.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SPAT ERUPTS OVER ISSUE OF CABINET-FORMING RIGHT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  29 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian and Frank Hsieh,
chairman of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party, on Sunday and
Monday, respectively, stressed that it is the president's right to
form the Cabinet after the year-end legislative elections.</P>
      <P>Both were responding to Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou's remark Sunday
in Tainan, southern Taiwan, that if the opposition camp wins over
half of the legislative seats in the Dec. 1 elections, the president
should hand over the right to form the Cabinet. The popular mayor
made the comment while stumping for candidates of the Kuomintang
(KMT), the opposition party with the most seats in the present
Legislature.</P>
      <P>President Chen said that the fact that the right to form the
Cabinet is the president's "is a matter of common sense," adding that
"you don't have to have a doctoral degree to understand this," in an
apparent indirect reference to Ma, who holds a doctoral degree in law
from Harvard University.</P>
      <P>The president pointed out that just as the Taipei mayor appoints
major officials and just as the U.S. president forms his cabinet
instead of the majority party in Congress forming it, he "certainly
will form the Cabinet" after the elections.</P>
      <P>Chen pointed out that if one were to act according to the
rhetoric of the opposition camp, then this would mean that they
would end up ruling the country regardless of whether they had won
the presidency, asking rhetorically what the point of holding a
presidential election would be.</P>
      <P>DPP Chairman Hsieh on Monday also criticized Ma's remark, saying
it will not win the support of the people.</P>
      <P>On the opposition camp's demand that the ruling party turn over
the right to form a Cabinet or else chaos in the political situation
will result, Hsieh said that this is tantamount to "political
blackmail."</P>
      <P>He stressed that the people are most concerned about whether
there will be growth in the economy and stability in politics and
that they are less concerned about who holds political power.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said that in the past, the Republic of China constitution
had stipulated that the president's choice for the post of premier
had to gain the approval of the Legislative Yuan, but that under the
revised constitution, the Legislative Yuan no longer has this right
of approval and the forming of the Cabinet is a presidential power.</P>
      <P>Ma for his part said Monday that he would not speak again on the
issue of the right to form a Cabinet, mentioning only that he would
elaborate on his view in due time following the elections if it
became necessary.</P>
      <P>While in Tainan on Sunday, the popular mayor urged voters to rally
behind the "pan-blue alliance" before making his comment that if the
alliance wins more than half the seats in the Legislature, the
president should hand over the right to form the Cabinet to the
alliance so as to facilitate the operations between the executive and
legislative branches of government.</P>
      <P>Ma said that Taiwan could not afford more political chaos and
that the people could not wait any longer, adding that the president
should respect the will of the public as manifest in the results of
the elections. Chen's Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) currently
controls less than one third of the seats in the Legislative Yuan and
is hoping to increase this number in the elections.</P>
      <P>The "pan-blue alliance" refers to an alliance between the KMT and
its two splinter groups -- the New Party and the People First Party.
The three parties share a roughly common pro-unification stance on
relations with mainland China in contrast with the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party's pro-independence position.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TRADE WITH MAINLAND AS PROPORTION OF ROC'S TOTAL TRADE INCREASES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 29 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>While Taiwan's foreign trade has continued
to decline due to the global and domestic economic sluggishness, the
island's two-way trade with mainland China as a proportion of its
total trade has surged to a new high, the Board of Foreign Trade
(BOFT) reported Monday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's exports to mainland China as a proportion of its total
exports soared to 21.5 percent in August, while the island's imports
from mainland China as a proportion of its total imports increased to
6.2 percent, both representing record highs, BOFT officials noted.</P>
      <P>Taiwan exported US$2.029 billion worth of products to mainland
China in August, down 12.2 percent from the same month in the
previous year, while it imported US$475 million worth of products
from the mainland, down 2.9 percent, according to BOFT tallies.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's exports to and imports from mainland China began to
decline from the beginning of the second quarter of this year as part
of the consequences of the island's floundering economy. The scale of
this decline, however, has been much smaller than the decline in the
island's exports to and imports from other parts of the globe, BOFT
officials said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's two-way trade with mainland China amounted to US$19.29
billion for the first eight months of this year, marking a
year-on-year decline of 8.9 percent. The figure, meanwhile,
represented 12.4 percent of the island's entire foreign trade in the
period, up from the 11.1 percent for the same period in the previous
year, the officials quoted BOFT statistics as indicating.</P>
      <P>Electric machinery, machine tools, plastics, iron and steel,
synthetic fibers, and industrial textiles made up the bulk of
Taiwan's exports to mainland China in the January-August period, with
electric machinery and related equipment constituting 50 percent of
the island's total exports to the mainland, the officials said.</P>
      <P>In comparison, the top five categories of products that Taiwan
imported from mainland China during the eight-month period were
electric machinery and related equipment, machine tools, mineral fuel
and related products, iron and steel, and toys and sporting goods, in
that order.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER DEFENDS PRESIDENT CHEN'S COMPLAINT ABOUT DOSSIER TRANSFER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  29  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The controversy stirred up by President
Chen Shui-bian's allegation in his new book that last year's transfer
of power was completed through a "verbal transition" without dossier
handover continued to rage in the political community Monday.</P>
      <P>Several candidates running for legislative seats in the Dec. 1
elections as well as a civic group filed charges against former
President Lee Teng-hui over dossier law violations.</P>
      <P>In an effort to diffuse the controversy, Premier Chang
Chun-hsiung told the local press that President Chen's mentioning of
certain "facts" in his soon-to-be-published book was mainly aimed at
pushing for the establishment of a sound system regarding the
transition of power between different political parties, and not at
blaming any individual persons or government agencies.</P>
      <P>In his book, titled "The First Voyage of the Century," President
Chen particularly accused the National Security Council (NSC) of
failing to hand over its files. He claimed that he was in total
darkness about the NSC's work and problems. Excerpts of the book,
which will come off the press Wednesday, were made available over the
weekend in a Presidential Office release.</P>
      <P>Premier Chang, who was head of Chen's transition team, said he is
convinced that Chen mentioned the issue mainly because the president
intends to set up a system to govern transitions of power. Last
year's peaceful transition of power from the Kuomintang (KMT) to the
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) was the first ever in the Republic
of China's history.</P>
      <P>Chang cited two events -- the ROC's representation at the annual
summit meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum
and the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in the United States -- to
underscore the importance of the establishment of a wholesome system.</P>
      <P>In his view, Chang said, relevant government agencies should
leave detailed records on how the Presidential Office had decided on
the choice of a proxy to represent the president at the APEC summits
and how the Cabinet had responded to the Sept. 11 incident. "Such
records could be useful reference materials in the government's
future decision-making procedures," he noted.</P>
      <P>In reaction to Chen's allegation, several key members of a
pro-unification association filed a charge with the Taipei
Prosecutor's Office against former President Lee accusing him of
failing to hand over the NSC dossier to his successor. The
association has been critical of Lee over his alleged
pro-independence stance.</P>
      <P>Several candidates for the upcoming legislative elections,
including Ko Su-hai, Taipei City Councilor Wei Yi-lung and opposition
People First Party Legislator Lee Ching-hua, also filed similar
charges against the former president separately.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lee said the former president had handled many major
national incidents and issues -- including the 1996 Taiwan Strait
crisis and the choosing of Taiwan's representatives to the annual
APEC summits -- through the NSC during his 12-year stint as the head
of state.</P>
      <P>"If no official records concerning those events were left in the
Presidential Office, the former president might have offended our
country's dossier law and might even have committed such crimes as
damaging official documents and concealing national secrets," Lee
alleged.</P>
      <P>In response to Chen's allegation, former NSC Secretary-General
Yin Chung-wen issued a statement Sunday stressing that he had
personally handed over the complete NSC dossier to his successor
Chuang Ming-yao when the DPP administration was inaugurated May 20,
2000.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the KMT's Legislative Yuan caucus issued a statement
Monday demanding that the Presidential Office look into whether any
officials should be held accountable for failing to handling over the
NSC dossier during last year's transition of power.</P>
      <P>The statement said if the dossier had been properly transferred
as former NSC Secretary-General Yin claimed, President Chen should
issue a public apology for his "slip of the tongue."</P>

      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung on Monday
expressed his appreciation to outgoing Chadian Ambassador to the
Republic of China Salim Abderaman Taha for his contributions toward
enhancing relations between the two countries during his four-year
term.</P>
      <P>Premier Chang noted that since the resumption of diplomatic ties

cooperation between the two nations, adding that Taha played a
crucial role in the upgrading of bilateral relations and in the
promotion of bilateral exchanges.</P>
      <P>Taha noted that since the resumption of formal diplomatic ties,
bilateral cooperation has covered many major areas, citing as an
example the fact that the ROC has helped in the building of
hospitals, roads and bridges in Chad.</P>
      <P>He said that in the area of drinking-water improvements alone,
statistics show that infectious diseases in some parts of the African
nation have been eradicated, adding that the people of Chad are
appreciative of the ROC's assistance.</P>
      <P>Taha also expressed his heartfelt thanks for the assistance
rendered to him during his four-year term, stressing that bilateral
relations will be further cemented in the future.</P>
      <P>He added that after his return to Chad, there will be two ROC

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  29 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Monday that
Taiwan's economic fundamentals are good and expressed the hope that
the public will continue to have confidence in the country.</P>
      <P>President Chen made the remarks while receiving the winners of
awards in the stocks and futures field of business at the
presidential office.</P>
      <P>The president cited the Geneva-based World Economic Forum's
recently released "Global Competitiveness Report 2000-2001" which
rated Taiwan as the seventh most competitive economy over the next
five years, up from 11th place last year.</P>
      <P>Chen said that the report shows that Taiwan's economic
fundamentals are sound and that the island's potential cannot be
underestimated, adding the people of Taiwan should have faith in
themselves.</P>
      <P>On the fluctuations in the domestic stock market, the president
attributed them mainly to the effects of the global economic slump
and to several domestic factors.</P>
      <P>The president also pointed to Taiwan's fourth-place ranking in
terms of scientific development in the World Economic Forum's report,
saying this high ranking is the result of the Taiwan people's strong
abilities in terms of innovation and invention.</P>
      <P>The president said that all these points indicate that Taiwan has
sound economic fundamentals and good prospects.</P>
      <P>He also pointed to a report by the Financial Times that noted
Taiwan faces serious challenges in the global economy but that its
economy will not continue to be sluggish as the island enjoys certain
advantages, saying that the public should rally behind the
government.</P>
      <P>On the "go slow, be patient" policy toward investment in mainland
China, the president stressed that the policy had made significant
contributions in the past, but he added that with the changing times,
the government will now follow a policy of "active opening, effective
management."</P>
      <P>He urged domestic businesses to maintain their roots in Taiwan by
keeping their headquarters as well as research and development
departments in Taiwan, saying that mainland China will only be a part
of Taiwan's economic policy with a "global perspective."</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  29  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The number of arson cases in Taiwan has
continued to rise over the last three years, reaching a record high
of 1,004 in 2000, sources from the Ministry of the Interior (MOI)
reported Monday.</P>
      <P>The number of reported arson cases in 1999 climbed to 792 from
670 in 1998 before jumping to 1,004 in 2000,
officials from the MOI's National Fire Administration quoted ministry
tallies as indicating.</P>
      <P>National Fire Administration officials noted that while the
number of arson cases has been on the rise over the past several
years, the number of accidental fires has continued to decline, from
18,254 in 1999 to 15,560 in 2000.</P>
      <P>The officials warned of the ever-increasing increasing
seriousness of the implications of the rising number of arson cases,
particularly when the number of accidental fires declined by 2,694
over the last two years while the number of arson cases increased by
212.</P>
      <P>In the first eight months of this year, according to the tallies,
the number of accidental fires was 9,106, compared with 797 reported
cases of arson.</P>
      <P>Similar records disclosed in August by the National Fire
Administration showed that the number of arson cases in the first six
months of this year increased by 33.9 percent over the figure for the

(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>At least 13 combinations of banking,
insurance, and securities operations have been formed and will apply
for licenses to become financial holding companies, presaging
unprecedented fierce competition in Taiwan's financial services
market.</P>
      <P>An analysis by President Securities Corp. indicated that several
domestic financial groups have readied themselves to provide
full-fledged services when the government puts the Financial Holding
Company Law into force Nov. 1.</P>
      <P>In addition to Fubon Group and Lin Yuan Group, China Development
Industrial Bank, United World Chinese Commercial Bank and the
International Commercial Bank of China have expressed interest in the
corporate structure which will allow banks, insurers and brokerages
to operate in a cluster.</P>
      <P>The analysis said that the financial holding companies will have
the advantages of attracting more customers with their full-fledged
services. For fear of being edged out of the market by the leading
financial conglomerates, some banks, insurance companies and
securities houses are seeking to maintain their competitiveness
through mergers.</P>
      <P>The analysis pointed out that mergers are not necessarily the
answer for improving competitiveness and that the mushrooming number
of financial holding companies engaged with one another in price wars
will only damage the financial services market.</P>
      <P>The Financial Holding Company Law was passed by the Legislature
in early July as part of the government's financial reform programs.
With the opening of Taiwan's financial sector to international
competition when the island is admitted into the World Trade
Organization, Taiwan is embracing opportunities as well as
challenges, the analysis said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A small utility plane developed by a
Taiwan-U.S. joint-venture aircraft manufacturing firm, will take off
at a grand ceremony to be held in West Virginia in November, industry
sources said over the weekend.</P>
      <P>Lo Cheng-kuo, vice chairman of the joint-venture firm -- Tiger
Aircraft Co. -- said that prominent politicians and senior business
executives from the Republic of China and the United States,
including U.S. senators John D. Rockefeller and Robert C. Byrd, as
well as ROC Vice Minister of Economic Affairs Yin Chi-ming, will
attend the ceremony.</P>
      <P>"After more than two years of strenuous efforts, Tiger will be
able to receive certification from the U.S. Federal Aviation
Administration in the next few days for volume production of our new
AG5B small utility airplane," said Lo, who was in the San Francisco
area to promote the new plane.</P>
      <P>The four-seater, single-engine AG5B can fly for up to 500 miles
without refueling and will sell for only US$219,500, Lo continued.</P>
      <P>He noted that the United States now has 6,000 similar small
aircraft. "Tiger has received orders for 48 AG5Bs," Lo went on,
adding that eight of them will be delivered before the end of this
year.</P>
      <P>Lo said the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in New York and Washington
have sent the U.S. civil aviation industry into a tailspin.
"Nevertheless, the terrorist assaults have brought new business
opportunities to small plane manufacturers, as many globe-trotting
lawyers, doctors, engineers and business executives now prefer to
purchase or lease small aircraft for short- and medium-range travel,"
he noted.</P>
      <P>Tiger's plant in West Virginia can produce 180 to 200 AG5Bs per
year, Lo said, adding that the company plans to increase the number
of its marketing centers in the United States from the current four
to 15 over the next few years. Tiger will also construct a
maintenance and repair workshop in mid-2002 to enhance its after-sale
service.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EXCESSIVE EXPANSION CAUSES LOSSES FOR TAIWAN TFT-LCD MANUFACTURERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  29  (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Excessive expansion of their production
capacities had caused heavy losses for Taiwan's TFT-LCD (thin film
transistors -- liquid crystal display) manufacturers due to drastic
price drops, according to a report published Monday.</P>
      <P>The Industrial Technology Information Services (ITIS) forecast
that the production value of Taiwan's TFT-LCD manufacturers will
reach NT$89.9 billion in 2001, up 77 percent from the previous year's
level.</P>
      <P>The rapid expansion has enabled Taiwan's TFT-LCD manufacturers to
increase their international market share from last year's 11.6
percent to 22.9 percent.</P>
      <P>However, as the supply has far exceeded demand in the past few
months, TFT-LCD prices have dropped by 50 percent to 60 percent since
early this year. Sources in the local opto-electronics sector said
that heavy inventories and price drop might cause the four leading
TFT-LCD manufacturers to suffer losses as high as NT$25 billion this
year.</P>
      <P>The four leading manufacturers -- Au Optronics, Chi Mei
Optoelectronics Corp., Chunghwa Picture Tubes, and HannStar Display
Corp. -- are all planning to cut production costs by moving their
low-end assembly lines to mainland China.</P>
      <P>An ITIS report suggests that Taiwan's TFT-LCD manufacturers can
also lower their production costs by sourcing more components and
parts supplies domestically. At present, manufacturers rely heavily
on imports of key components.</P>
      <P>Although Monday's report predicts that TFT-LCD prices will remain
low and that no rebound is foreseen before the end of next year, many
Taiwan manufacturers are more optimistic about the prospects for next
year.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for Au Optronics said he expects that a gradual
recovery of the international demand for PCs in the second half of
next year will stimulate demand for TFT-LCDs.</P>
      <P>Au Optronics, a merger of Unipac Optoelectronics and Acer Display
Technologies, is the third-largest TFT-LCD manufacturer in the world,
next only to Samsung and LG Philips of South Korea. In the first half
of this year, Au Optronics's supplies accounted for 8 percent of the
world demand for TFT-LCDs.</P>
      <P>According to the ITIS report, Taiwan may catch up with South
Korea and Japan to become the world's No. 1 TFT-LCD supplier within
the next few years. In addition to Au Optronics, Chi Mei
Optoelectronics has been playing a dominating role in the
international market. The company took over DTI -- a joint venture of
IBM Japan and Toshiba -- in July and boosted its TFT-LCD production
capacity considerably.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SCHOLARS OPPOSE MERGER OF BUDGET OFFICE AND FINANCE MINISTRY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 28 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Three scholars have voiced opposition to a
government proposal to incorporate the Finance Ministry and the
Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS),
part of the government's reform package.</P>
      <P>Su Tsai-chu, a political science professor at the National Taiwan
University said last week that the merger of the two agencies --
whose functions do not overlap -- would neither achieve the reform's
goals of cutting down the number of employees nor improve government
efficiency.</P>
      <P>The Finance Ministry is charged with finding means for the
government, while the DGBAS is tasked with preventing the government
from wasting funds. According to Su, the two jobs cannot be mixed and
therefore the incorporation of the two agencies will not serve the
purpose of the government reform.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chu Che-min professor of finance at National Cheng Chi
University warned that the merger of the two agencies could damage
the independence of the budget planners and accountants.</P>
      <P>Staff responsible for the distribution of government financial
resources are more tools for elected government chiefs to carry out
their political agenda than ordinary government employees and should
be granted special protection to ensure that they "remain detached"
when performing their jobs.</P>
      <P>But, Chu said, their incorporation into the Finance Ministry will
compromise their independence and hamper the government's ability to
implement policy.</P>
      <P>Wei Duan, a former DGBAS chief and presently a researcher at
Taiwan Research Institute, a local think tank, said the merger will
rob government accountants of their ability to blow the whistle on
financial irregularities in various government agencies.</P>
      <P>The current system under which budget planners and government
accountants are appointed and supervised by the DGBAS rather than
chiefs of the government agencies for which they work will be
scrapped after the merger, and budget planners as well as government
accountants will lose their independence once they are appointed and
controlled by the heads of the government units in which they work.</P>
      <P>Wei credited the current system, which has operated for more
than 70 years, with "eliminating" the once-prevailing corruption of
book-tampering and payroll-padding. According to Wei, it has also
minimized other financial irregularities.</P>
      <P>Unless a better system of checks and balances is put in place,
Wei said, the current system of an independent DGBAS should remain.</P>

      <P>Yan said in his speech to nearly 100 members of AACS -- the only
academic society in America devoted exclusively to the general area
of Chinese studies -- that although cross-Taiwan Strait exchanges are
unavoidable, they should be conducted at a gradual pace in keeping
with "reality."</P>
      <P>Taiwan faces the challenge of trying to strike a balance between
maintaining national dignity and acquiring realistic advantages, he
added.</P>
      <P>During the process of globalization, he continued, Taiwan can be
a springboard for foreign companies venturing into mainland China
because of the island's geographic and cultural advantages as well as
its abundant international trading experience.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, he warned that Taiwan must not accept Beijing's "one
China" principle because it would allow Beijing to rule over and
destroy the Republic of China.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER URGES AUSTRALIA TO EASE VISA RESTRICTIONS ON ROC OFFICIALS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  29 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung urged Australia
Monday to ease visa restrictions on Republic of China officials
with a view to facilitating bilateral exchanges and cooperation.</P>
      <P>Chang made the appeal during a farewell meeting with outgoing
Australian Representative to the ROC Sam Gerovich, who has been
assigned to a new post in Shanghai.</P>
      <P>"I felt regret over the Australian government's recent denial of
a visa to the ROC's Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission
(OCAC) Chairwoman Chang Fu-mei," Chang said, adding that he hopes
similar events would never happen again.</P>
      <P>Noting that Australia's move has hindered the OCAC chief's plan
to visit ROC expatriates in Australia, Premier Chang said he looks
forward to seeing a breakthrough in high-level ROC-Australian
exchanges in the future.</P>
      <P>Chang went on to express his appreciation of Gerovich's efforts
to promote substantive relations between the two countries during
Gerovich's four-year services in Taipei.</P>
      <P>For his part, Gerovich said he was grateful for the ROC
government's support and assistance for his work during his stint in
Taipei. "I take great pleasure in seeing remarkable progress in
trade, immigration, travel and student exchanges between our two
countries over the past four years," he added.</P>
      <P>Gerovich said he will study the feasibility of promoting
commercial and civilian exchanges among Taiwan, mainland
China and Australia after assuming his new post in
Shanghai.</P>
      <P>For instance, Gerovich said he will look into whether there is
room for Taiwan and Australian firms to cooperate in investing
in Shanghai and other mainland areas.</P>
      <P>In response, Chang said he admires Gerovich's ambition.
Nevertheless, he said, further development of trade and economic ties
across the Taiwan Strait relies on peace in the Taiwan Strait. "We
hope that the long-stalled cross-strait dialogue can resume as early
as possible to ensure a peaceful environment for bilateral
exchanges," he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DEPRESSED STOCK MARKET MAY BE AN OPPORTUNITY: ENTREPRENEUR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  30 (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The sluggishness of Taiwan's stock market
may be an opportunity, in the eyes of a leading entrepreneur, for the
Taiwan business sector to reduce its zealousness for the securities
market and to refocus on economic fundamentals.</P>
      <P>Day Sheng-tong, president of the National Association of Small-
and Medium-Size Enterprises, ROC, said Tuesday that Taiwan's stock
market experienced its heyday early last year when the dot-com myth
drove the stocks of related companies to unrealistic highs.</P>
      <P>The entrepreneur said that at that time, the electronics
manufacturing sector, which created no more than 20 percent of the
job opportunities around island, was able to attract 80 percent of
all the capital invested in the stock market.</P>
      <P>Many businesspeople lost track and began neglecting their own
trade when they started focusing on making easy money on the stock
market, according to Day.</P>
      <P>The collapse of the "bubble economy" and the ensuing drastic
decline in share prices since late last year have seriously shaken
the public's confidence in Taiwan's economy.</P>
      <P>Day said that a depressed stock market, negative economic growth
and a decline in foreign trade have worsened the confidence crisis.
However, he pointed out that Taiwan's economic prospects are not as
bad as they seem judging by the sound fundamentals of the
manufacturing industry.</P>
      <P>When businesses dedicate their efforts and invest money in
upgrading their operations and improving their products, more job
opportunities can be created, he said, adding that laying off
employees or moving businesses overseas might not be the best
solution to meet the new challenges.</P>
      <P>Companies that have built sound operational structures will be
able to weather the storm, and Taiwan industry will be healthier when
companies that don't make the grade are weeded out of the market,
according to Day.</P>
      <P>Remaining optimistic about Taiwan's economic prospects in the
coming year, Day however said that politicians should avoid engaging
in further verbal squabbling as this may cause an exodus of
disillusioned businesspeople.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 30 (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition New Party lawmakers said Tuesday
in response to President Chen Shui-bian's call for the media to
report more good news that the obligation of being supervised by the
media comes with being in power.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lai Shyh-bao reminded the president that his election
to the nation's highest office can also be said to have been aided by
the media which reported both good and bad news.</P>
      <P>Chen said in his soon-to-be-published book titled "The First
Voyage of the Century" that the media should be "magpies" that bring
good tidings in addition to being "crows" that report on the "pains."</P>
      <P>In the book, which goes on sale Wednesday to mark his first 500
days in office, the president also called on the media to be
impartial and self-disciplined and to keep national security matters
in mind when reporting on sensitive issues.</P>
      <P>However, New Party lawmaker Elmer Fung said that "only dictators
would suppress journalistic freedom by using the pretext of national
security."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, ruling Democratic Progressive Party legislator Tsai
Ming-shian said that the media should defend freedom of the press,
but he added that he hopes it can report in a balanced and
responsible manner.</P>
      <P>Tsai urged members of the media to firmly maintain their role as
the fourth estate and avoid becoming the propaganda tools of any of
the political parties or candidates in the year-end elections.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EXPERTS WARN ABOUT TAIWAN'S GROWING TRADE DEPENDENCE ON M'LAND MARKET</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 30 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Following the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in
the United States, mainland China has emerged as a relatively stable
market that looks even more attractive to Taiwan business, but
experts warn about the risks of Taiwan's growing trade reliance on
the mainland Chinese market.</P>
      <P>Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) tallies show that in 2000,
the United States and Japan absorbed 20.8 percent and 19.1 percent,
respectively, of Taiwan's total exports worth US$148.32 billion,
while Europe took in 14.8 percent, the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations 13.3 percent, and Hong Kong 11.6 percent of the total.</P>
      <P>However, it is worth noting that the same statistics show that
mainland China and Hong Kong together absorbed 22.8 percent of
Taiwan's overall outbound shipments last year, surpassing the United
States as Taiwan's largest export outlet.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's exports to the mainland Chinese market as a ratio of its
overall exports rose from 11.1 percent in 1999 to 11.2 percent in
2000, and the percentage climbed to 12.1 percent for the first seven
months of this year, according to the MOEA statistics.</P>
      <P>The figures show that Taiwan's export sector has become
increasingly dependent on the mainland Chinese market, experts said,
warning that under such circumstances, any drastic changes in the
mainland Chinese market will have a serious impact on Taiwan's
foreign trade businesses.</P>
      <P>Since the beginning of this year, the global political and
economic situation has undergone dramatic changes. The Sept. 11
terrorist attacks against the United States have cast a cloud of
uncertainty and anxiety over the world's economic situation.</P>
      <P>With mainland China's imminent entry into the World Trade
Organization (WTO) and its successful bid to host the 2008 Olympic
Games, mainland China has in turn become a more stable market,
further attracting Taiwan businesspeople to invest there.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan is also to join the WTO in the near future, it is
expected that trade across the Taiwan Strait will grow even faster, a
situation which experts say may stir up another wave of "landing by
Taiwan businesspeople on the mainland."</P>
      <P>According to assessments by the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC),
Taiwan outbound shipments have primly focused on the mainland Chinese
market, while 50 percent of Taiwan investment overseas is directed to
mainland China.</P>
      <P>C. S. Chou, director of the MAC's Department of Economic Affairs,
questioned what the point is in promoting cross-strait trade if this
will eventually hurt Taiwan's economy and its independence.</P>
      <P>Chou said that as the private sector is eager to edge into the
mainland Chinese market, the government's trade and financial
authorities should provide Taiwan businesses with sufficient and
accurate information about the mainland market.</P>
      <P>He contended that relevant government authorities should hammer
out a detailed program on exploring the mainland Chinese market and
set up a risk-monitoring system amid growing economic exchanges
between the two sides.</P>
      <P>The MAC official warned government trade policy makers not to
dance to the tune of Taiwan businesspeople, adding that it is
extremely important for the policy makers to gain a deeper
understanding of the dangers hidden in the mainland market.</P>
      <P>Taipei Import-Export Association Chairman Lee Tung-liang said
external trade is Taiwan's sole weapon for maintaining its economic
development, but he called attention to the fact that mainland China
is not the only outlet in the world for Taiwan businesses.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LEGISLATURE PASSES NEW BILLS TO UPGRADE LEGISLATIVE EFFICIENCY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  30  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan passed two bills
amending parts of its existing Organic Law as well as its Operational
Statutes Tuesday with a view to upgrading parliamentary efficiency.</P>
      <P>Under the new rules, the minimum number of legislators needed to
form a caucus in the Legislature will be raised from five to eight.</P>
      <P>The revision is mainly aimed at restricting the number of
legislative caucuses in order to facilitate the formation of
parliamentary consensus on major policy issues, legislative sources
said.</P>
      <P>Under the Legislature's revised Organic Law, any political party
which manages to garner at least 5 percent of the vote in the
legislative elections will be qualified to form a caucus, and
legislators should join party caucuses based on their party
affiliation.</P>
      <P>Independent legislators and those whose party fails to win 5
percent of the vote in the legislative elections can either join
other party caucuses or associate with a minimum of seven other
colleagues to form a new caucus.</P>
      <P>According to the Organic Law, a caucus can propose a legislative
bill for deliberation.</P>
      <P>Also passed Tuesday was an amendment to the Legislative Yuan's
Operational Statues that frees a new Legislature from screening bills
left over by the previous Legislature, except for budget bills and
petitions filed by ordinary citizens.</P>
      <P>Under the present statutes, the Legislature is required to screen
bills that had been approved by the preceding chamber's standing
committees. Many lawmakers have complained that the requirement has
prevented them from working on new bills to reflect the latest public
opinion. The new rule will ease lawmakers' workload and allow them to
have more time to deliberate newer bills to meet the demands of the
public, parliamentary sources said.</P>
      <P>The newly amended laws are effective as of the inaugural day of
the new Legislature to be elected Dec. 1. According to the Republic
of China constitution, the new Legislative Yuan will open Feb. 1,
2002.</P>

      <P>Taiwan does not produce, possess nor deploy
nuclear, biological or chemical weapons, a military spokesman said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Col. Chu Chih-hung, deputy director of the National Defense
Medical Bureau's medical and health-care department, said at a
routine news conference at the Ministry of National Defense that the
military has no choice but to prepare against possible biological
attacks and that it will grow germ cultures if necessary.</P>
      <P>However, Chu stressed that producing germ cultures is different
from producing biological warfare agents. All hospitals are able to
grow germ cultures from patients, but the military does not conduct
research on how to apply them to war, he added.</P>
      <P>As to mainland China's capabilities in developing biological
warfare agents, Chu said that the information is too sensitive to
divulge.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, military spokesman Maj. Gen. Huang Suey-sheng said at
the same news conference that the military has been working with the
Department of Health to strengthen the nation's capabilities in terms
of countering diseases and has established emergency response teams
with the power to rapidly and accurately determine biological warfare
agents.</P>
      <P>Huang said that the military has completed the compilation of a
soldier's handbook on defending against biological warfare.</P>
      <P>The handbook, which will be distributed to all echelons of the
armed forces, lists basic measures of protection that can be taken in
the event of encountering biological warfare agents, Huang added.</P>
      <P>Chu said that such attacks are most likely to be carried out in
cities, industrial zones and transportation hubs with higher
population densities.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT HEAD BLASTS PRESIDENT CHEN'S NEW BOOK</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taitung   County,   eastern  Taiwan,  Oct.  30  (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan charged Tuesday that President
Chen Shui-bian's new book has been causing damage to different people
"one chapter at a time."</P>
      <P>Lien said that he did not "play (Chen) for a fool" by first
agreeing to scrap an 84-hour bi-weekly labor work hour bill and then
writing a letter ordering KMT legislators to support the bill as Chen
said in the latest excerpt from the book, which will go on sale later
this week to mark the president's first 500 days in office.</P>
      <P>Lien urged Chen to give up his election promise of cutting down
labor working hours to 40 hours per week -- a move that opponents
have said could lead to serious industry-wide repercussions resulting
from lost productivity.</P>
      <P>Lien went on to say that when he met with Chen on Oct. 27 last
year, he had recommended that the president actively serve as a
coordinator between the management and labor forces that had been
arguing over the bill.</P>
      <P>He even recommended to the president at the time that the
implementation of the new working hour scheme be delayed, Lien added.</P>
      <P>Lien criticized Chen's soon-to-be-published book titled "The
First Voyage of the Century" for attacking former President Lee
Teng-hui in the first excerpt that was released, Vice President
Annette Lu in the second excerpt, members of the media in the third
and Lien himself in the fourth.</P>
      <P>The KMT chairman said a more appropriate title for the book would
be "The Lost Voyage of the Century."</P>
      <P>Lien's criticisms coincided with those of opposition People First
Party Chairman James Soong, who called the series of excerpts "soap
opera episodes" meant to affect the outcome of the Dec. 1 elections.</P>
      <P>In the first book excerpt, Chen charged that the National
Security Council of the former Lee administration had failed to hand
over certain dossiers when the new administration came to power last
May.</P>
      <P>In the second excerpt, Chen said that although the vice president
has always been only a nominal head, he has allowed her to
participate in many activities. However, he said that the post of the
vice president is not the same as being "half a president," pointing
to controversial moves such as Lu's organizing and hosting of an
international event that is usually the job of the president.</P>
      <P>In the third excerpt, the president said that the media should be
"magpies" that bring good tidings in addition to being "crows" that
report on the "pains," should strive for more balanced reporting and
should keep national security matters in mind when handling sensitive
issues.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOFA PLANNING TO OFFER HUMANITARIAN AID TO AFGHAN REFUGEES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  30  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China government has
drafted a package of measures to extend humanitarian aid to Afghan
refugees amid continued U.S. strikes on Afghanistan in retaliation
for its sheltering of terrorists, an official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Francis T. N. Chang, director of the West Asian Affairs
Department under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA), made the
remarks at a routine news conference.</P>
      <P>Chang said the ministry has called several rounds of meetings of
relevant government agencies and civic groups to discuss measures for
assisting Afghans displaced by the ongoing U.S. attacks.</P>
      <P>"We have come up with an initial plan," Chang said, adding that
the MOFA has asked the ROC's embassies and representative offices
abroad to seek appropriate channels for delivering cash and relief
goods donated by individual ROC nationals and organizations to needy
Afghan refugees.</P>
      <P>U.S. forces began to attack the Taliban regime in Afghanistan
early this month after the Islamic regime declined to hand over
Osama bin Laden, the key suspect of the Sept. 11 terrorist assaults
that toppled New York City's World Trade Center and partially
damaged the Pentagon in Washington.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chang said the MOFA will offer necessary assistance
to foreign celebrities who are scheduled to visit Taiwan in early
November to attend the inauguration of a museum of religions in
Taipei County.</P>
      <P>"The ministry will grant courtesy treatment and technical
assistance to prominent international figures who will come to Taipei
for the inauguration of the Museum of World Religions Nov. 8," Chang
said.</P>
      <P>Former U.S. Vice President Al Gore and world-renowned religious
leaders and religion experts from Russia, Saudi Arabia, Israel,
Jordan and many other countries will take part in the museum's
opening ceremony and a seminar on preservation of religious
relics. Gore is expected to deliver a keynote speech at the seminar.</P>
      <P>The museum, the brainchild of a local Buddhist master, will be
dedicated to promoting reconciliation among different religions.
After more than a decade of construction and preparations, the
museum's founders have managed to collect numerous religious
scriptures, artifacts, instruments, objets d'art, more than 7,000
books various religions as well as 2,000-plus video and audio
recordings on religious subjects.</P>
      <P>Its founders said they want to make the museum, the first of its
kind in Taiwan, "a temple without boundaries" and "a retreat for
everyone from the unrest in the world."</P>

    <HEADLINE>OPPOSITION UPSET OVER CEC'S DECISION ON LISTING OF PARTY AFFILIATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  30  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislators from the "pan-blue alliance"
voiced strong discontent Tuesday over the Central Election
Commission's decision to disallow Wang Chien-shien from listing a
recommendation for him by three parties under the party affiliation
column in an election bulletin.</P>
      <P>The "pan-blue alliance" refers to an alliance between the
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and two of its splinter groups -- the New
Party (NP) and the People First Party (PFP). The three parties share
a roughly common stance of pro-unification regarding relations with
mainland China in contrast to the more pro-independence position of
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>Legislators Ting Shou-chung and Hung Hsiu-chu of the KMT, which
has the most seats in the Legislature, as well as the NP's Cheng
Long-shui and the PFP's Lin Yu-fang called a press conference at the
Legislative Yuan to strongly protest the CEC's decision that Wang can
only list one party under the party affiliation column, saying the
CEC is trying to "interfere with the integration of political
parties."</P>
      <P>They pointed out that the CEC's decision seriously violates the
spirit of the Election and Recall Law and is an attempt to splinter
the alliance, adding that they will ask the Council of Grand Justices
for an interpretation of the decision.</P>
      <P>Wang, a former finance minister known for his integrity, will run
for Taipei county magistrate in the Dec. 1 elections. He is the only
candidate so far who has been endorsed by the "pan-blue alliance" in
its integration efforts aimed at winning the elections.</P>
      <P>Ting also said the DPP's spreading of news that cooperation
between the PFP and DPP after the election would cost it the least
was an attempt by the party to drive a wedge between the "pan-blue
alliance."</P>
      <P>Legislator Hung stressed that President Chen, whether in the
Taipei mayoral race or in the presidential race, has been successful
by playing rivals off against each other.</P>
      <P>Realizing that cooperation among the three parties of the
"pan-blue alliance" will seriously undermine the election prospects
of incumbent Taipei County Magistrate Su Tseng-chang of the DPP, Hung
said the DPP has resorted to the tactic of trying to cause rifts in
the alliance.</P>
      <P>Referring to the CEC decision, Hung said that there are many
cases in other democratic countries of a candidate listing
recommendations by more than one political party, adding that the CEC
should use these cases as a reference.</P>
      <P>PFP Legislator Lin also said because Wang has an excellent chance
of winning the Taipei County magistrate election, the DPP has used
its resources to interfere with his chances. He suggested that Wang,
who is of the New Party, not fill in the party affiliation column to
indicate that he represents a party outside the DPP.</P>
      <P>NP Legislator Cheng also suggested that he incorporate the colors
of the three "pan-blue alliance" parties into his campaign logo and
that he run as an independent candidate as a last resort.</P>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) is
aiming at completing its planned reforms to the Legislative Yuan in
the next Legislature, Wu Nan-jen, secretary-general of the ruling
party, said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Wu said that the reforms will include halving the number of seats
in the Legislature and implementing a single-seat, two-votes system
-- referring to one vote for a candidate and one vote for a party.</P>
      <P>Wu noted that the public can no longer put up with the chaos at
the legislative branch and that carrying out the reforms will be the
most important political task of the DPP, adding that all political
parties have their own views on reform but that they lack substantial
plans.</P>
      <P>Wu said that the DPP has completed the paper work on the reforms
and that the plan will be turned over to its Central Standing
Committee for approval over the next few days before the party seeks
the consensus of the other political parties.</P>
      <P>On the question of whether to lengthen the term of legislators
to four years to coincide with that of the president, he said this
will require consultations with the other political parties.</P>
      <P>Noting that passing amendments to the constitution requires the
attendance of at least three-fourths of all legislators and the
consent of three-fourths of those present, Wu said that the DPP will
have to gain the consent of all the major political parties in order
to successfully pass its parliamentary reforms.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that the DPP will complete work on the amendment
of the organization law of the National Assembly by next May and will
finish work on the constitutional amendment and the amendment to
the Election And Recall Law by next June.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PFP CHAIRMAN WORRIED ABOUT POLITICAL CHAOS IN WAKE OF DEC. 1 POLLS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  30  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition People First Party (PFP)
Chairman James Soong expressed worry Tuesday about possible domestic
political chaos in the wake of the Dec. 1 elections for legislators
and local government chiefs.</P>
      <P>Soong told a group of local reporters on his way to the
northeastern county of Ilan to stump for PFP candidates for the
upcoming legislative elections that the period between the end of the
critical polls and the inauguration of the fifth Legislative Yuan
Feb. 1, 2002 could be a "turbulent period" in Taiwan's political
development.</P>
      <P>"If the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and the main
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) fail to restrict their incumbent
legislators who lose their re-election bids in the upcoming polls
from exercising their legislative power between the election and
their ouster from the legislature," Soong said, "I cannot imagine
what kinds of bills or actions they might engineer."</P>
      <P>Should that be the case, Soong said, the domestic political arena
will be "rough and turbulent."</P>
      <P>In his view, Soong said, the present domestic political problems
do not lie in "chaos in the parliament" as the ruling party claims,
but rather in the DPP's incompetence, inexperience and frequent
policy flip-flops.</P>
      <P>Worse still, Soong claimed, the DPP leadership's "disrespect for
the Republic of China's constitutional system" has aggravated the
current domestic political plight.</P>
      <P>Touching on DPP Secretary-General Wu Nai-jen's idea that the cost
of a DPP-PFP tie-up after the December polls would be minimal, Soong
said it is premature to talk about how a coalition government will be
formed.</P>
      <P>"We must respect public opinion and the legislative electoral
outcome," Soong noted, adding that the ongoing DPP-KMT spat over
which party should lead the formation of a new Cabinet in the wake of
the elections indicates their disrespect for public opinion.</P>
      <P>In addition, Soong went on, the DPP-KMT squabble is aimed at
containing and squeezing the PFP's chances of victory in the year-end
polls. He did not elaborate.</P>
      <P>Soong also questioned the propriety of President Chen Shui-bian's
decision to publish memoirs on his first 500 days in office. "Few
heads of state in the world have ever published their memoirs while
still in office," he said.</P>
      <P>Chen's new book, titled the First Voyage of the Century, will
come off the presses this week. Excerpts of the book have been made
available in the past few days, stirring up heated discussions on
Chen's allegations about the lack of dossier transfer in last year's
transition of power from the KMT to the DPP, as well as on his views
about Vice President Annette Lu and the role of domestic news media.</P>

      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung presided Tuesday
over a ceremony to mark the issue of the 2001 World Cup Baseball
Taipei Commemoration stamp series issued by the Directorate General
of Post (DGP).</P>
      <P>Minister of Transportation and Communications Yeh Chu-lan also

      <P>The 34th World Cup Baseball Championships will open
simultaneously at the Tienmu Diamond, the Hsinchuang Stadium, the
Chiayi Stadium and the Chengching Stadium in Kaohsiung County on Nov.
6. A total of 16 national teams from five continents will vie for the
champion during the 12-day competition.</P>
      <P>The DGP issued the set of four stamps featuring a pitcher, a
batter, a catcher and a batter sliding into a base as backgrounds and
one stamp featuring the Republic of China team to commemorate the
first time the world cup has been held in Taipei.</P>
      <P>In related news, Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou called on Taipei
citizens to attend the Chinese Taipei-Italy game at the Tienmu

      <P>He said that this will be the second time that the world baseball
tournament will be held in Asia. The powerful Cuban nine has
dominated the competitions in past years and as of 1998, Cuba had
captured 22 championship cups since 1939, the first year in which the

    <HEADLINE>CHILDREN OF FOREIGN BRIDES PRONE TO SLOW DEVELOPMENT, DOCTOR CLAIMS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  Oct.  30  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Children of mothers who are foreign
brides in Taiwan are prone to slowness or retardation in their mental
and linguistic development due to their mothers' difficulties in
adapting to new environments, a local medical source claimed Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Foreign nationals who settle in Taiwan after marrying Republic of
China citizens are often found to have trouble learning local
languages and adapting to their new lives, as well as "insufficient
relationship support," which eventually affects their children's
physical and psychological development, according to a pediatrician
at Kaohsiung Chang Kung Memorial Hospital.</P>
      <P>In a three-month survey of 13 mother-child groups, Dr. Chou
Wen-chun found that 63 percent of the children whose mothers are
foreign brides suffer certain levels of development retardation, with
slowness in language development topping the list of problems,
followed by "mixed development retardation."</P>
      <P>From clinical observation, Chou said, mental and psychological
factors exert great impact on the learning ability of the children of
foreign brides, while the mothers themselves encounter difficulties
raising their children.</P>
      <P>In the survey, Chou claimed, mothers from mainland China have
greater self-confidence than those from Southeast Asian countries,
probably because most of the mainland wives come from big cities and
have higher levels of education.</P>
      <P>By comparison, wives from Southeast Asian countries are
relatively quieter and "evidently" have more adaptation problems,
according to Chou.</P>
      <P>However, Chou admitted that her results need longer periods of
observation and that individual cases need to be followed to examine
how the "psychological problems" of foreign brides affect their
children's mental and physical development.</P>
      <P>Chou added that foreign bride mothers need greater assistance and
support than their local counterparts to allow them to live and raise
normal and healthy children in Taiwan.</P>

foreign laborers. All alien workers, including housemaids and
caretakers, as well as those working in the manufacturing and
construction industries, will be subject to the new regulation.</P>
      <P>The new wage calculating formula will help local employers save
an estimated NT$10 billion per year in salaries for foreign laborers
amid the current domestic economic downturn, according to industry
sources.</P>
      <P>To help offset the decrease in wages for foreign laborers, local
manpower agencies will be prohibited from collecting brokerage fees
-- NT$30,000 per person at present -- from legal foreign workers
after the new package becomes effective.</P>
      <P>Additionally, brokerage fees for overseas manpower agencies --
NT$26,000 per head -- will be lowered to the level of the present
NT$15,840 minimum monthly wage for foreign laborers.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, foreign laborers will have to pay NT$1,500 to
NT$1,800 in "monthly service charges" to local manpower brokerage
houses under the new rules, up from the current amount of NT$1,000.
The measure was designed to defuse a backlash from local manpower
agents over the cancellation of their brokerage fees.</P>
      <P>In line with the new policy, local employers will still have to
pay brokerage fees to local agents if they want to employ foreign
laborers.</P>
      <P>To ensure smooth implementation of the new package, Kuo said, the
CLA has conducted extensive negotiations with major labor supply
countries. "All of them have agreed to our new policy," he noted.</P>
      <P>Under the new policy, Kuo said, the ROC will diversify its
foreign manpower sources, with Myanmar topping the list of possible
new sources. Mongolia and Sri Lanka might also be included on the
list.</P>
      <P>At present, Thailand, the Philippines, Indonesia and Vietnam are
the main sources of legal foreign workers in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Kuo said the CLA has compiled an "alarming index" on the total
number of foreign laborers based on the domestic unemployment rate,
the labor shortage rate and the present number of foreign workers.</P>
      <P>In terms of this index, Kuo said, the government must continue to
implement its current retrenchment policy, at least in the
foreseeable future, as the total number of foreign workers in Taiwan
during the first nine months of this year has reached an alarming
level.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Kuo went on, the CLA will adjust its policy on
employment of foreign housemaids and caregivers.</P>
      <P>As the number of foreign housemaids and caregivers reached 9,112
at the end of September and the number has shown signs of a steady
rise, Kuo said the CLA will tighten restrictions on local families
intending to hire foreign family helpers from Nov. 9.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, he continued, restrictions on hiring foreign
housemaids by foreign expatriates in Taiwan will be largely eased in
order to attract foreign investors, high-tech engineers and senior
managerial executives.</P>
      <P>All foreign expatriates who have obtained legal residency in
Taiwan and have an annual income of NT$3 million or over can apply to
employ foreign family helpers and housemaids.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Two former Ministry of Education officials
were among 33 people charged with serious offenses Tuesday after the
Taipei District Prosecutors' Office announced the close of the
notorious Jin Wen scandal following an 11-month investigation.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors said they were seeking a 15-year sentence for former
Education Minister Yung Chaur-shin and a life sentence for former
Vice Education Minister Lin Chao-hsien, on charges ranging from
graft, fraud, taking bribes and document forgery to embezzlement for
helping the Jin Wen Group illegally expand its business operations.</P>
      <P>Yung was accused of illegal influence peddling to allow the Jin
Wen Group buy land, while Lin was charged with illegally approving
the group to set up a junior high school.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors were also seeking a 12-year term for Chang
Yu-huei, a former minister without portfolio who was in charge of
illegally granting a bank loan of NT$1 billion, while he was
chairman of the state-run Central Trust of China.</P>
      <P>Both Yung, Lin and Chang pleaded not guilty and denied that they
had taken bribes from the Jin Wen Group to buy villas built by the
group at prices much lower than normal market prices.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors also asked for a 12-year term for Chang Wan-li,
chairman of the Jin Wen Group who has remained at large overseas
after the case was uncovered earlier this year.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Minister of Education Ovid Tzeng said he was unable to
comment on the indictments, but he lamented that some ministry
officials and former ministry officials were allegedly involved in
the scandal, the worst case of its kind in Taiwan's education

      <P>Ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) Chairman Frank Hsieh said Tuesday that his party would not rule
out the possibility of cooperating with any other political party to
form a coalition government after the Dec. 1 legislative and local
elections.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks to quell controversy caused by DPP
Secretary-Secretary Wu Nai-jen's statement a day earlier that
"cooperating with the People First Party (PFP) would be the least
costly."</P>
      <P>Wu's statement was rejected immediately by PFP officials who said
that the PFP does not want to cooperate with the DPP.</P>
      <P>Hsieh told reporters at the Kaohsiung City Council that the DPP
will form a coalition government after the year-end elections, but
added that any other party could be a coalition partner.</P>
      <P>He said that the DPP has already evaluated the advantages and
disadvantages of cooperating with the various parties and added that
his party will not announce its conclusions before the elections, as
it might affect the results.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ILLEGAL COMMISSIONS SUSPECTED IN FRENCH JET FIGHTER SALES TO TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Paris,  Oct. 29 (CNA)
(By Tzou ming-jhie &amp; Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Part of the huge sum found in bank accounts
of an arms broker at the center of a multinational scandal might be
illegal commissions from the French sale of 60 Mirage-2000 jet
fighters to Taiwan in 1992, according to Monday newspaper report.</P>
      <P>Le Monde said French investigators suspect the 250 million Swiss
francs (about 5 billion French francs) in two Swiss bank accounts
owned by Andrew Wang may come from not only the French sale of six
Lafayette-class frigates in 1991, but also from the Mirage sale.</P>
      <P>The funds were frozen in April by the Swiss authorities and a
Paris court has assigned two magistrates -- Renaud Van Vuymbeke and
Dominique de Talance -- to look into Wang's role in the Lafayette
sale.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Swiss magistrate Paul Perraudin was charged by Bern
authorities with investigating Wang's bank accounts in that country
to see if illegal gains were stashed there.</P>
      <P>Le Monde quoted sources familiar with the case as saying that the
last cash deposits in Wang's Swiss bank accounts were in 1999,
coincident with Taiwan's payment for the Mirages rather than for the
Lafayettes.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's armed forces paid for the frigates and the jet fighters
according to deliveries made by the French builders -- Thomson-CSF
for the frigates and Dassault Aviation Concern for the jets. The
whole payment for the frigates was completed in 1999 but the payment
for the Mirages is not yet finished, although Taiwan took delivery of
the 60 planes in 1997.</P>
      <P>Le Monde said Wang got a commission of 3 billion French francs
from the sale of the Lafayettes and 2.4 billion francs from the sale
of the Mirages and missiles they carry.</P>
      <P>Former French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas, who was charged in
Paris by prosecutors with taking bribes in approving the sale of the
six frigates to Taiwan in 1991, claimed in a June 18 interview with
Le Figaro daily that 70 percent of Wang's commission went into the
coffers of French political parties or was used to line the pockets
of politicians in France and other countries.</P>
      <P>Dumas, however, failed to support his allegations and van
Ruymbeke and de Talance had thus far to find any evidence to verify
Dumas' claims.</P>
      <P>Wang's Swiss funds came to light in April when he tried to
transfer 1.7 billion French francs from his accounts to accounts
opened in another Swiss bank in the names of his son and wife. The
authorities, alerted by the unusual movement of huge funds, ordered
the accounts blocked pending its owner's explanation.</P>
      <P>It was at that time the Swiss authorities found that Wang is a
arms broker wanted in Taiwan for his role in the sale of French arms
to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Wang, who served as Thomson's agent in Taiwan, fled the island in
1993 before the Taiwan authorities could question him in connection
with the death of a navy captain in 1993. The captain was in charge
of the navy's weapons acquirement programs.</P>
      <P>Wang lives in Oakland, California and has never been
investigated, despite the fact that there is a warrant for his arrest
on murder charges in Taiwan, partly because of the lack of an
extradition accord between the United States and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The disclosure of Wang's Swiss bank accounts prompted the
Republic of China Navy to ask Thomson Aug. 22 for 4.39 billion French
francs in compensation -- the alleged commission in the sale of the
frigates.</P>
      <P>Naval authorities claim that Thomson promised in its contract
that the 16 billion French franc price tag for the frigates did not
include any commission. The case is still pending in Paris.</P>

      <P>Officials of the Control Yuan, the highest
watchdog body of the Republic of China, said Tuesday that they may
take steps to investigate an alleged payoff scandal involving
Taiwan's purchase of 60 French-made Mirage jet fighters.</P>
      <P>According to a report a day earlier in the French daily Le Monde,
part of a huge sum deposited in Swiss banks by Taiwan arms broker
Andrew Wang might be illegal commissions on the Mirage deal.</P>
      <P>The Control Yuan's task force on a similar scandal involving the
French sale to Taiwan of six Lafayette-class frigates in 1991 held a
meeting Tuesday to review the progress of its investigation into
under-the-table kickbacks originating from the sale of the frigates.</P>
      <P>Two members of the task force visited Switzerland and other
European countries recently to collect data related to the scandal.</P>
      <P>Wang, who is wanted in Taiwan, is a key person in the scandal.
Some 250 million Swiss francs in two Swiss bank accounts belonging to
him have been frozen by the Swiss authorities since last April.</P>
      <P>The Le Monde report implies that Wang's money at the two banks
might have come from commissions not only from the frigate sale, but
also from the Mirage deal.</P>
      <P>Under the contracts signed by Taiwan and the dealers, no
commissions were allowed to be paid in the two deals and should
commissions have been paid, Taiwan would be entitled to seek
compensation from the dealers.</P>
      <P>The task force plans to publish the conclusions of its
investigation on the Lafayette payoff scandal, probably before the
Dec. 1 legislative and local elections.</P>
      <P>A member of the task force said that he is also planning to get

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  30 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The former chief of the National Security
Council denied Tuesday that the council or any other units under the
Presidential Office withheld secret files from the new administration
during Taiwan's 2000 power transition.</P>
      <P>Ding Mou-shih, who served as secretary-general of the National
Security Council between 1994 and 1999 under then-President Lee
Teng-hui and in 2000 as secretary-general of the Presidential Office,
also under Lee, issued a statement Tuesday claiming that all files of
the two agencies were handed over to the administration of President
Chen Shui-bian, who succeeded Lee.</P>
      <P>Ding said in the statement that he left his job at the National
Security Council in 1999 after -- handing over all files, memos and
official seals to his successor -- to take his new job at the
Presidential Office when President Lee was still chairman of the
council.</P>
      <P>When Chen swept to power in the 2000 elections, Ding said he had
already been named the staff chief of Lee's office, and had listed
and transferred all office items to the transition team of Chen after
his inauguration on May 20 that year. He said he also asked the
National Security Council, as well as the Executive Yuan -- both of
which are under the Presidential Office to follow suit.</P>
      <P>He said that all the transfers were done smoothly.</P>
      <P>As for Chen's claims that files concerning Lee's decision to
float his controversial claims for Taiwan's statehood against
mainland China are missing from the council's archives, Ding said Lee
aired the so-called "speical state-to-state claim" in July,
1999, six months after Ding started his new job at the Presidential
Office.</P>
      <P>Ding said his secret contacts with U.S. officials on behalf of
the island were carried out on the orders of Lee and that he was
joined by officials from other government agencies on these missions.
Ding said he reported back to Lee after each of these contacts.</P>
      <P>Ding's statement was a response to Chen's claims Sunday in his
new book that when he took the helm of the National Security Council
on May 20 last year, he was surprised to find that the council did
not even have any complete minutes of its previous meetings.</P>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung reinforced the president's suggestion
that the previous Kuomintang administration withheld secret security
files from the new government by complaining to the legislature
Monday that the National Security Council did not have any record of
the impact of Lee's "special state-to- state claim" on the country.</P>
      <P>Although he did not dispute Chen's claims head-on, Ding's
statement was seen as a veiled denial of his claims, similar to a
response made by Yin Tsung-wen, who succeeded Ding as
secretary-general of the National Security Council.</P>
      <P>Refusing to answer questions from journalists, Yin said a day
earlier only that "the answer is evident so long as you bother to
retrieve the files according to the rules."</P>

    <HEADLINE>INNOVATION CAN HELP TAIWAN APPAREL INDUSTRY REVITALIZE ITSELF: CHEN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  31  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's traditional textile and garment
industry is recasting itself as a high technology manufacturing
industry, which requires innovation to allow it to create a "second
spring" of development, President Chen Shui-bian said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The president made the remarks while addressing the opening
ceremony of the annual conference of the International Apparel
Federation (IAF) held in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Chen said the textile and apparel industry has traditionally been
Taiwan's "golden-egg-laying hen," which has not only created a
commendable number of job opportunities, but has also been a driving
force behind Taiwan's go-go economic development over the last two
decades.</P>
      <P>Nowadays, Chen noted, Taiwan's textile and apparel industry has
begun to take off its "traditional overcoat" and put on a new "outfit
of high technology."</P>
      <P>Chen said there is no so-called "sunset industry" in Taiwan,
although there are "sunset products" and "sunset management
concepts," adding that all traditional industries that seem to be
out-dated can create a new era of prosperity for themselves so long
as they embrace the spirit of innovation, speed and endeavor.</P>
      <P>The president noted that all Asian countries' textile and garment
industries are facing transition challenges and the task of
repositioning themselves on the world stage. He said that although
their counterparts in Europe and North America are leading the
trends, the Asian manufacturers, from a continent with richly diverse
cultures and styles, still have great potential for further
development and bright business prospects.</P>
      <P>The IAF is holding its three-day annual conference in Taipei
under the auspices of the Taiwan Textile Federation with the
participation of representatives from 25 member countries, most of
which are from Europe and America.</P>
      <P>This represents the second time that the IAF has held its annual
meeting in Taiwan since 1991.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  31  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Despite the fact that the civil aviation
industry has since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in the United
States been facing its biggest challenges in recent history, a
non-profit group has continued to push for a plan to nurture domestic
pilots.</P>
      <P>China Aviation Development Foundation (CADF) said Taiwan's first
civilian flight training center, which was inaugurated Sept. 1, will
start to recruit trainees next January and will begin its training
courses April 1.</P>
      <P>After receiving 18 months of intensive training, the trainees
will be helped by the CADF to find work with domestic airlines, and
it is expected that more than 100 pilots will be added to domestic
airlines every year, according to the CADF.</P>
      <P>Statistics compiled by the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA)
show that there are currently 1,511 domestic pilots and 526 foreign
pilots working for domestic airlines. To cut over-reliance on foreign
pilots, the CAA has in recent years been cooperating with a
foundation at National Taiwan University on a project nurturing local
pilots.</P>
      <P>This year, the CADF has decided to start its own training
program, hoping to diminish reliance on foreign pilots in a shorter
period of time.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CONTROL YUAN HEAD TO PRESENT TAIWAN DONATION TO NEW YORK CITY</HEADLINE>

(By Eric Tseng and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Control Yuan President
Fredrick Chien is scheduled to arrive in New York City Saturday with
a cash donation of nearly US$1 million that Taiwan is offering to the
Big Apple in the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</P>
      <P>Chien, a veteran diplomat and ROC representative in the United
States before becoming head of the Control Yuan, Taiwan's top
watchdog agency, is expected to present the donation on behalf of the
ROC government to New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani in person on
Sunday.</P>
      <P>The cash donation represents the concerns and sympathy of the ROC
government toward the people of New York City who suffered the trauma
of the terrorist attacks, in which nearly 6,000 people were killed
and the city's landmark twin towers of the World Trade Center were
brought down.</P>
      <P>Chien, who was the ROC's foreign affairs minister between 1990
and 1996, will be accompanied by staff members of the Buddhist
Compassionate Relief Tzu Chin Foundation, Taiwan's largest charity
organization, and World Vision Taiwan, another influential charity
group on the island, during the trip.</P>
      <P>In addition to presenting the Taiwan donation to the New York
City mayor, Chien is also expected to meet with representatives from
New York's Chinatown, conveying the ROC government's concerns and
greetings to members of the Chinese and Taiwan communities there.</P>
      <P>Chien is the latest in a string of high-level ROC officials to
recently visit New York City, with visits made by President Chen
Shui-bian and Premier Chang Chun-hsiung within the past year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MND PLAYS DOWN LATEST PLANNED U.S. ARMS SALES TO TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  31 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of National Defense (MND) on
Wednesday played down the planned U.S. sales of spare parts to Taiwan
for various types of military aircraft, saying that the deal is
mainly for logistics supply purposes.</P>
      <P>The ministry has traditionally refrained from making any comments
on arms dealings with the United States.</P>
      <P>An MND official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, explained
that the items in the sales package unveiled by American authorities
Tuesday are all spare parts for U.S.-made military aircraft now in
service in the Republic of China's Air Force.</P>
      <P>"This is a normal `cooperative logistics supply support
arrangement' and does not have any sensitive significance," the
official noted.</P>
      <P>According to the official, the United States will provide spare
parts for various types of military aircraft, including the F-5E/F
and F-16 A/B jet fighters, and the C-130H transport planes, as well
as for the U.S. systems and subsystems installed on the
Taiwan-developed Indigenous Defense Fighter (IDF).</P>
      <P>The U.S. Defense Security Cooperation Agency said Tuesday it had
notified Congress of a possible agreement to provide Taiwan with
spare parts and logistical support for the F-5E/F and F-16 fighter
jets, the C-130H transport plane, and for the U.S. systems of the IDF
aircraft.</P>
      <P>The agency under the U.S. Department of Defense said the sale
would not affect the basic military balance in the Taiwan Strait
area, adding that it would also not have an adverse impact on U.S.
defense readiness.</P>
      <P>"These spare parts are required to assure that aircraft and
aircraft systems previously procured from the United States are
maintained in a mission ready status," the agency said in a news
release.</P>
      <P>The price tag for the new sales package is estimated at US$288
million.</P>
      <P>Last Friday, the U.S. defense cooperation agency also announced a
proposed sale of 40 JAVELIN anti-tank missile systems to Taiwan at an
estimated cost of US$51 million.</P>
      <P>If the U.S. Congress approves the sale as expected, this will
represent the first addition of JAVELIN missiles to the ROC's
anti-armor arsenal.</P>
      <P>Military sources said the systems would enhance Taiwan's
medium-range anti-tank capability, provide Taiwan with a strong
anti-landing capability and increase its inter-operability with U.S.
forces. With a range of approximately 2,500 meters, JAVELIN is
equipped with an imaging infrared system and a fire-and-forget guided
missile.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NUMBER OF PRIMARY, JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL DROPOUTS IN TAIWAN TOPS 8,600</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 31 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A total of 8,666 students in Taiwan dropped
out of elementary or junior high school last year, representing a
dropout rate of 0.3 percent, according to recently released Ministry
of Education statistics.</P>
      <P>The statistics showed that the figure was up by 328 from the 1999
level, and the ministry estimated that some 3,000 of the dropouts
might have gone missing based on an the average missing rate of 35.6
percent registered among dropouts during the 1996-1998 period.</P>
      <P>The so-called dropouts refer to those primary and junior high
school students who stop attending school and receiving their
compulsory education for a long period of time.</P>
      <P>Investigations showed that dropouts are three times to five times
more likely to commit crimes than youths who remain in school and
that they are likely to create many problems for society should they
be unable to go back to school.</P>
      <P>Experts and specialists have therefore called on the Ministry of
Education and school authorities to take effective measures to help
dropouts return to school.</P>
      <P>In addition, the drug addiction rate among dropouts is 10 times
that of youths who remain in school, experts said, adding that as
many as 60 percent to 70 percent of the juvenile delinquents and
young female prostitutes are dropouts.</P>
      <P>They warned that the large pool of dropouts may have become the
main source for illegal criminal rings in recruiting new blood.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ASSETS MANAGEMENT COMPANIES MAY FURTHER DEPRESS REAL ESTATE MARKET</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 31 (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Central Bank of China Deputy Governor Chen
Shih-meng said Tuesday that Taiwan's sluggish real estate market
might be further depressed if assets management companies (AMCs)
suppress the purchasing prices too much.</P>
      <P>Chen made the comments while addressing the opening ceremony of
the seminar in Taipei Oct. 30-Nov. 1 on non-performing loans (NPLs)
resolution mechanisms and their impact on the financial systems,
sponsored by the Southeast Asian Central Banks Research and Training
Center (SEACEN).</P>
      <P>AMCs have functioned effectively in many countries in resuming
lending and in recovering fair value of distressed assets, especially
when the financial systems were in trouble.</P>
      <P>Chen said that the establishment of AMCs is one of the mechanisms
that has been applied by Taiwan's financial authorities to help solve
the problem of the existence of a large number of ailing financial
institutions.</P>
      <P>The Bankers Association of the ROC set up the first AMC in
Taiwan, namely the Taiwan Asset Management Co., early this year after
the government gave the green light at the end of last year. Several
domestic banks and international financial institutions also plan to
apply for licenses.</P>
      <P>At the SEACEN seminar, representatives from SEACEN member states
are examining the causes of NPLs and their effects on banking
systems. Since the Asian financial crisis, many Southeast Asian
countries have adopted mechanisms to resolve the problem of NPLs and
to reduce their devastating impacts on the real economy.</P>
      <P>Since the mechanisms may have brought certain side effects, the
bank executives are using the opportunity of the three-day seminar in
Taiwan to review the effectiveness of the mechanisms and to share
their experiences.</P>
      <P>SEACEN was set up in 1982 with eight member central banks (Bank
Indonesia, Bank Negara Malaysia, the Central Bank of Myanmar, Nepal
Rastra Bank, Bangko Sentral ng Philipinas, the Monetary Authority of
Singapore, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, and the Bank of Thailand.
With the addition of the Bank of Korea in 1990, the Central Bank of
China, Taipei, in 1992, and the Bank of Mongolia in 1999, the
regional organization has now 11 members.</P>
      <P>The organization has conducted research studies on financial,
banking and economic developments in member countries and in the
region as a whole, in addition to sponsoring training programs and
seminars.</P>

plan, adding that the AEC has also instructed the state-owned Taiwan
Power Co. to step up related safety measures at the island's existing
nuclear power plants.</P>
      <P>Shen said that if Taiwan can obtain the U.S. plan, it will
benefit Taiwan's safety measures regarding nuclear power plants. But
he also said that the plan has to be kept secret so as not to allow
terrorists to use it as a reference in planning attacks on nuclear
power plants.</P>
      <P>Both sides decided that they would not go into details regarding
substantive security measures and that they would act cautiously by
leaving the matter for future face-to-face meetings.</P>
      <P>As there have been several incidents of control rod cracks at
Taiwan's nuclear power plants, both sides also agreed to cooperate on
research into the causes of nuclear rod cracks as well as repair and
maintenance work.</P>
      <P>On emergency responses outside nuclear power plants, both sides
agreed that the AIC and the Federal Emergency Management Agency of
the United States will conduct exchanges on drills, mobilization and
response measures.</P>
      <P>In response to Taiwan's "nuclear-free homeland" policy, the
participants also agreed to cooperate on the decommissioning of
nuclear power plants, with Taipower and the U.S. Energy Department to
establish bilateral communication channels.</P>
      <P>The AIC's Fuel Cycle and Materials Administration will also send
officials to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission to receive
six-month training on the disposal of highly radioactive waste.</P>
      <P>Alex Burkart, deputy director of the Office of Nuclear Energy
Affairs under the State Department's Nonproliferation Bureau, led a
20-member delegation made up of U.S. officials responsible for
nuclear affairs, environmental protection and laboratory heads to the
meeting in Hualien.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, participants also discussed the issues of
nuclear energy safety, protection against radiation, nuclear power
for consumers and nuclear waste disposal, as well as reviewed
existing cooperation projects.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FOLK SNACK INGREDIENT PROMISING TO BECOME IMPORTANT CASH CROP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 31 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A creeper herb which can be processed into
a black jelly dessert traditionally called the "Divine Grass" in
Taiwan, is promising to become one of the island's most lucrative
cash crops, sources from the Council of Agriculture (COA) reported
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The "Divine Grass," whose botanical name is mesona, has recently
been designated by the Cabinet-level COA as a "star" cash crop to be
aggressively promoted in northern Taiwan after COA researchers found
that mesona has an average cost efficiency of NT$280,000 (US$8,116)
per hectare of plantation, compared with NT$80,000 (US$2,319) per
hectare of paddy for rice.</P>
      <P>Mesona, a creeper herbaceous plant, has been casually planted by
farmers islandwide at the foot of orchard plants or beside vegetable
fields and has until now been considered only an insignificant
by-product of farming.</P>
      <P>After conducting research for 10 years, the COA Agricultural
Improvement Station in Taoyuan, northern Taiwan, successfully
developed a new, revised species of Taiwanese mesona, naming it the
"Taoyuan No. 1."</P>
      <P>According to the COA researchers, "Taoyuan No. 1" is best suited
for cultivation in the northern Taiwan counties of Taoyuan, Hsinchu
and Miaoli, and the herb's unique properties make it suitable for
processing into a high-added-value instant nutritious dessert food
which can be mass-produced for commercial sale.</P>
      <P>"Taoyuan No. 1" mesona is scientifically-proven to contain a high
percentage of ursolic acid and oleanolic acid -- good anti-oxidant
agents which are also effective at combating tumors and lowering
blood sugar levels, the researchers said.</P>
      <P>"Taoyuan No. 1" mesona requires a much smaller amount of starch
when it is processed into "Divine Grass Jelly" as it has much
stronger gelatin-forming characteristics than do other dried mesona
varieties which used to be imported from mainland China and Indonesia
to be sold to Taiwan snack dealers at lower prices, the researchers
pointed out.</P>
      <P>Recently, Japanese researchers confirmed that mesona indeed has
certain properties that have medical value and are planning to use
the herb to produce a bottled anti-cancer "functional drink,"
according to the Taoyuan researchers.</P>
      <P>Since mesona has never been planted in Japan, the "Taoyuan No. 1"
mesona is commercially promising in terms of becoming a lucrative
export to Japan for the production of the health drink, they noted.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, COA officials in Taoyuan are planning to promote
"Taoyuan No. 1" mesona, aiming to make the herb into instant mesona
packs for quiche desserts, mesona tea bags, and mesona pudding and
ready-to-serve mesona dishes for sale in supermarkets.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.S. NOT SUPPORTIVE OF TAIWAN USING WTO `EXCLUSION PROVISION'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Oct.  30  (CNA)
(By Herman Pan and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The U.S. government does not support
either side of the Taiwan Strait employing the "exclusion provision"
against the other after the two are admitted to the World Trade
Organization (WTO), a senior U.S. trade official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>In a speech delivered at the Foreign Press Club, U.S. Assistant
Trade Representative Jeffrey Bader said there is so far no sign
showing that either Taiwan or mainland China will employ the
"exclusion provision" against the other after their WTO accession.</P>
      <P>According to WTO regulations, a member is allowed to exclude
another member from open market treatment under certain conditions.</P>
      <P>Bader said he would be surprised if the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait employ the "exclusion provision" against each other under the
WTO framework.</P>
      <P>In his view, Bader said, such a practice is not in the interests
of either side.</P>
      <P>It was the first time that a senior U.S. official has explicitly
expressed the U.S. government's stance on this politically sensitive
issue.</P>
      <P>Sources said U.S. officials have often inquired in private
whether Taiwan would employ the "exclusion provision" against
mainland China after WTO entry. But this was the first time that U.S.
authorities have publicly expressed their attitude of not supporting
the idea of Taiwan employing that provision against the mainland.</P>
      <P>Bader, a China hand who once served as the State Department's
China desk chief under the Clinton administration, said if Taiwan and
mainland China employ the "exclusion provision" against each other,
their benefits from WTO accession would be restricted.</P>
      <P>Should that be the case, he said, they would be unable to use the
WTO's arbitration mechanism to resolve their bilateral trade
disputes. They would also face difficulties enjoying normal trade
treatment or status, he added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Zoellick said Tuesday
that the WTO would formally admit Taiwan and mainland China as its
full members at its ministerial meeting scheduled for Nov. 9-13 in
Qatar.</P>
      <P>Zoellick said he doesn't think that mainland China has any tricks
up its sleeve to block Taiwan's WTO entry at the upcoming meeting.</P>
      <P>In Taipei, senior officials have on many occasions said the
Republic of China government has yet to make a final decision on
whether to employ the "exclusive provision" against mainland China.</P>
      <P>Minister of Economic Affairs Lin Hsin-yi said Monday Taiwan will
wait until the last minute to make known its decision on the
"exclusion provision" issue on the grounds that there is the
possibility that Beijing might use its political clout to interfere
with Taiwan's WTO entry.</P>
      <P>According to Vice Minister of Economic Affairs Chen Ruey-long,
the issue regarding whether Taiwan will employ the "exclusion
provision" is still under intensive assessment.</P>
      <P>"The ROC government will make a decision based on the best
interests of the nation at the most `opportune time,'" Chen said.</P>
      <P>Under WTO regulations, if Taiwan finally decides to employ the
"exclusion provision" against mainland China, it must put forth the
proposal to the WTO Secretariat before the world trade regulatory
body approves its membership bid.</P>

(By Edward Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former U.S. Secretary of Defense William
Cohen on Wednesday called on Republic of China Foreign Affairs
Minister Tien Hung-mao and other high ranking officials.</P>
      <P>Cohen, accompanied by a two-member entourage, arrived in Taipei
Tuesday for a three-day visit.</P>
      <P>On Wednesday morning, Cohen called on Lin Chong-pin, vice
chairman of the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC), and
then met with Foreign Minister Tien Hung-mao in the afternoon.</P>
      <P>Cohen was originally scheduled to call on the commander-in-chief
of the ROC Navy, Adm. Lee Chieh, on Wednesday afternoon. However,
Adm. Lee left for Tzoying Naval Port in southern Taiwan early
Wednesday morning.</P>
      <P>Unconfirmed reports said that Cohen visited Taiwan's naval
fleet in Tsoying and was briefed by Adm. Lee there earlier in the
morning.</P>
      <P>Although Cohen has stepped down from the post of defense
secretary, he has comprehensive knowledge of the Asian-Pacific
situation. It is generally believed that Cohen's current trip to Asia
is aimed at winning the right for the company he now represents to
help the ROC Navy acquire the submarines it is looking to add to its
fleet.</P>
      <P>Cohen was very friendly toward Taiwan when he was a member of the
Senate and of the House of Representatives in the past. He supported
the U.S. policy of engagement with Beijing but felt that an
improvement in U.S.-mainland Chinese relations should not come at the
expense of Taiwan's security.</P>
      <P>During his stay in Taipei, Cohen will be received by ROC
President Chen Shui-bian and call on Premier Chang Chun-hsiung and
Defense Minister Wu Shih-wen.</P>
      <P>Cohen is expected to leave Thursday for Japan to continue his
Asian trip, which will also take him to South Korea and Singapore.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN STUDENTS SAID TO BE AFFECTED BY U.S. TIGHTENING OF VISA POLICY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>San Francisco, Oct. 30 (CNA)
(By Neil Lun and Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan students planning on studying
in the United States will be at least indirectly affected by U.S.
President George W. Bush's move to tighten restrictions regarding
foreign student visas, a Republic of China official in San Francisco
said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Huang Mei-chu, cultural section chief of the Taipei Economic and
Cultural Office in San Francisco, said that the U.S. move targets
mainly those countries that are related to terrorist activities, but
he added that Taiwan students will inevitably face more restrictions,
such as more rigorous screening, when they apply for student visas.</P>
      <P>Huang said the American Institute in Taiwan, which represents
U.S. interests in Taiwan in the absence of formal diplomatic ties,
will also rigorously require those students applying to study in the
United States to actually attend school when they issue the visas.</P>
      <P>President Bush said Monday that the United States will tighten
its visa policy, adding that the United States' generous policy in
this area has been taken advantage of in the past. One of the 19
hijackers who crashed one of the planes in the Sept. 11 attacks
entered the United States legally with the kind of visas routinely
granted each year to foreign students, according to the U.S.
Department of Justice.</P>
      <P>But Huang also said that the real factors affecting Taiwan
students' willingness to study in the United States may be on the
Taiwan side, with many students choosing not to go to the United
States out of safety concerns in the wake of the terrorist attacks.</P>
      <P>In fact, even before the terrorist attacks, she said that the
number of Taiwan students studying in the United States had recently
been decreasing each year. The number of Taiwan students studying in
America last year totaled 29,234, ranking the island as the fifth
largest source of foreign students in the United States as compared
with its first-place ranking in the past.</P>
      <P>Huang noted that rising tuition fees at U.S. colleges and
universities as well as Australia's and New Zealand's active
solicitation of Taiwan students by promoting their lower school fees
have contributed to the decline in the number of Taiwan students
studying in America.</P>

    <HEADLINE>UMC EXPECTS BUSINESS REVENUE TO INCREASE IN FOURTH QUARTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  31  (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>United Microelectronics Corp.'s business
revenue might bottom out in the fourth quarter as prospects for the
wireless market are improving and customers are sending in new
orders, according to UMC Vice Chairman John Hsuan.</P>
      <P>Hsuan said at an investors conference Tuesday that the company's
third-quarter revenue amounted to NT$11.9 billion, down 20.3 percent
from the second quarter level.</P>
      <P>In the July-September period, UMC suffered after-tax losses
amounting to NT$4 billion, as the production facility utility rate
was lower than 40 percent.</P>
      <P>The sluggish wireless market has had a great effect upon UMC, as
the chip manufacturer targets mainly the market for communication
products. Hsuan said that better prospects can be expected for the
coming months as the wireless market is showing signs of recovery and
many customers have succeeded in reducing their heavy inventories.</P>
      <P>Although the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on the United States may
have cast uncertainty on the market, UMC is confident that business
revenue will go up next year, according to Hsuan.</P>
      <P>The market climate has affected UMC's imminent capital investment
plans. Company Vice Chairman Peter Chang said that UMC reduced its
capital investment from the projected NT$1.5 billion to NT$1.1
billion for the year. Judging from this year's business environment,
the company may also reduce the amount of its capital investment set
for next year, he added.</P>
      <P>Most of UMC's capital investment was used to build a 12-inch
wafer foundry at the Tainan Science-based Industrial Park this year
and Chang emphasized that 12-inch wafers will definitely become a
trend.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EXECUTIVE YUAN ASKED TO REVISE BUDGET PROPOSAL FOR FISCAL 2002</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 31 (CNA)
(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The legislative caucuses of the opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) and New Party (NP) warned Wednesday that if the
Executive Yuan fails to revise the budget proposal for fiscal 2002,
they will boycott budget deliberations.</P>
      <P>The opposition parties had complained that the current budget
proposal does not reflect the actual situation and is not in line
with a resolution adopted by the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>As a result, the Legislative Yuan resolved a day earlier that the
Cabinet must revise the budget proposal by the end of November.</P>
      <P>Responding to the demand, Directorate General of Budget,
Accounting and Statistics chief Lin Chuan said that it is very hard
to accept the demand as it would be a time-consuming task which
cannot be finished in just one or two months.</P>
      <P>The leaders of the KMT and NP legislative caucuses criticized
Lin's attitude and warned that if he fails to present a revised
version of the budget proposal to the Legislative Yuan by the
stipulated time, the two parties will refuse to deliberate the
budget.</P>
      <P>The legislative caucus of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) described the move as "going too far."</P>
      <P>A DPP leader said that there is "no need" to make such a
"trouble-causing" demand because the content of the budget proposal
can be altered during the legislative deliberation.</P>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan will go into a one-month recess Thursday to
allow lawmakers to campaign for re-election in the Dec. 1 elections.</P>
      <P>The KMT now controls a slim majority in the Legislative Yuan, but
no single party is expected to win a simple majority in the upcoming
elections.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian has stated that he will form a coalition

    <HEADLINE>DPP HEAD VOWS TO PROMOTE CUTTING LEGISLATIVE SEATS BY HALF</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  Oct.  31  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Frank Hsieh, chairman of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), said Wednesday that he will do
his best to promote the aim of cutting the number of legislative
seats by half.</P>
      <P>Promising that he will demand that DPP candidates in the Dec. 1
legislative elections issue a joint declaration on the matter and
make it a plank in their campaign platforms, Hsieh said that he will
also ask candidates from other political parties to sign a pledge in
an effort to jointly promote the aim of reforming the Legislative
Yuan through constitutional amendments.</P>
      <P>Hsieh told the local press that all candidates taking part in the
coming legislative race should publicly express their support for the
pledge and jointly work out a timetable for the reduction by half of
the 225-seat parliament.</P>
      <P>"Only by doing so can a national consensus be forged which will
be essential to launch constitutional amendments to achieve this
goal," he stressed.</P>
      <P>After the transition of power in May last year, many forms of
corruption and defects have gradually emerged, Hsieh pointed out,
adding that the DPP-led government is determined to probe all these
cases, despite a backlash from vested interest groups.</P>
      <P>Commenting on a question raised by Kaohsiung city councilors that
the annual salaries of Kaohsiung municipal hospital presidents are
too high and that their pay should be adjusted to reduce the
financial burden on the city government, Hsieh said that it is unfair
to compare their salaries with his own and that high pay for such
experts is "necessary to protect the benefits of all citizens."</P>
      <P>According to an income list made public by a Kaohsiung city
councilor, a vice president of a Kaohsiung municipal hospital can
earn NT$7.58 million per year, including an annual salary and all
fringe benefits, far ahead of Hsieh's annual income of NT$2 million.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Trade and economic relations across the
Taiwan Strait will see a breakthrough with the Cabinet approval
Wednesday of a package of guidelines for expanding the scope and
functions of the "offshore transshipping center."</P>
      <P>The Cabinet approved the package at its weekly meeting, which was
chaired by Premier Chang Chun-hsiung.</P>
      <P>Chang said the passage of the package signifies the government's
determination to improve cross-strait relations and to substantiate
consensus reached at the Economic Development Advisory Conference
held in August.</P>
      <P>To ensure the smooth implementation of the new "open door" trade
policy, Chang said the Cabinet will expand the scope and functions of
the "offshore transshipping center" in a gradual manner.</P>
      <P>In the initial stage, he said, mainland China-originating goods
will be allowed to enter Taiwan for processing for export to third
destinations.</P>
      <P>"We hope mainland China can reciprocate our goodwill measures by
opening more mainland ports for direct offshore cross-strait
transshipping services and lifting restrictions on cross-strait cargo
transportation," Chang said, adding that the two sides should resume
dialogue as soon as possible to further boost bilateral trade and
economic exchanges.</P>
      <P>Government spokesman Su Tzeng-ping said that once the new package
is put into force, raw materials from mainland China can be processed
into semi-finished or finished products for delivery to other
countries or areas.</P>
      <P>"This will mark a big step forward in cross-strait commercial
exchanges and will also help upgrade Taiwan's competitiveness in
becoming a major global transshipment center," Su explained.</P>
      <P>The package of guidelines was jointly thrashed out by the
Mainland Affairs Council, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the
Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Transportation and
Communications.</P>
      <P>The package will be formally implemented after all those relevant
government agencies have drawn up various enforcement rules, Su said.</P>
      <P>According to the package, Kaohsiung Harbor in southern Taiwan
will remain the only domestic port allowed to operate offshore
cross-strait transshipping services, although its scope and functions
will be expanded.</P>
      <P>At present, mainland China-originating goods cannot enter Taiwan
through the transshipping center.</P>
      <P>Under the new package, raw materials and semi-finished mainland
goods can be processed at Taiwan's export processing zones, bonded
factories, science-based industrial parks and bonded warehouses for
eventual delivery to other countries and areas.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the government will no longer impose a cap on the ratio
of added value after processing in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In addition to the existing maritime and sea-air cross-strait
transshipping services, the new package will also allow the opening
of cross-strait air-sea transshipping services in the future.</P>
