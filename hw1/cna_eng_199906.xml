    <HEADLINE>ROC MINISTER LEAVES FOR SEOUL FOR APEC INVESTMENT FAIR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  1 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>ROC Economics Minister Wang Chih-kang left
for Seoul on Tuesday to attend the first investment fair sponsored
by the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum.</P>
      <P>Wang is the first ROC ministerial-level official to visit South
Korea since the two countries severed formal diplomatic relations in
August 1992.</P>
      <P>Wang said prior to his departure that he is going to Seoul to
attend an APEC event. "Therefore my itinerary there will mostly
belong to group activities, including meeting with South Korean
President Kim Dae Jung," he noted.</P>
      <P>President Kim broached the idea of holding an investment fair
under the APEC framework at the 1998 APEC informal leadership
meeting. Kim said the fair would stimulate investment activities in
APEC countries and thus help boost their economic development and
overcome regional financial woes.</P>
      <P>Kim's proposal won unanimous support of the top leaders of all
APEC member economies and South Korea was granted the right to
organize the first-ever APEC investment fair from June 1 through June
5.</P>
      <P>Wang is accompanied by a large delegation of economics officials
and senior executives of private business groups on his Korean
visit.</P>
      <P>Wang said the ROC's exhibition booth at the fair will introduce
the country's ambitious plan to develop Taiwan into an Asia-Pacific
business operation hub.</P>
      <P>Another theme is to introduce Taiwan's 10 star industries --
aerospace, biotechnology/pharmaceuticals, communications,
information, consumer electronics, semiconductors, precision
machinery/automated technology, high-end materials, medical equipment
and environmental protection, Wang said.</P>
      <P>By 2002, Wang said, the total production of the 10 star
industries will reach US$94.2 billion.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taipei-based Core Pacific Group will introduce
several large investment projects with a view to attracting
European, American and Japanese investors.</P>
      <P>All of the 21 APEC member economies, including Taiwan, mainland
China and Hong Kong, have sent delegations to attend the gala. More
than 2,000 companies from the APEC countries have presented dazzling
exhibits and lucrative investment proposals in the fair.</P>
      <P>In connection with the show, South Korean organizers have planed
a series of speeches and workshops on new investment trends, the
role of foreign capital in economic development and many other
related topics.</P>
      <P>Wang is scheduled to return to Taipei on June 5.</P>

calendar. Following is a list of important events that have occurred
on this date in the past:

1815: Napoleon Bonaparte, emperor of the French from 1804 to
1814, swears fidelity to the French constitution. His military and
political might gripped Continental Europe but failed to encompass
Great Britain.

1868: James Buchanan, the 15th president of the United States
dies at the age of 77. The first bachelor to be elected president, he
tried to maintain a balance between pro-slavery and anti-slavery

South, and he was unable to forestall the secession of South Carolina
on Dec. 20, 1860.

life and became an icon after her death, is born. She appeared in
several motion pictures, including "Some like It Hot" and "The
Misfits."

1929: A state funeral for China's Dr. Sun Yat-sen is held in
Nanking at the Dr. Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum on Mount Tzuchinshan.

China, dies at the age of 65. Yu formerly had served as governor of
Taiwan and premier of the ROC.

1968: Helen Keller, the blind and deaf American author and
teacher, dies at home in Easton, Connecticut, at the age of 87,
ending a life of outstanding courage that has brought hope and
inspiration to thousands.

1968: The Joint Service Committee for Overseas Chinese and
Foreign Investor is established in Taipei.

1973: British Honduras changes its name to Belize.

1978: The ROC Executive Yuan approves the appointments of Lin
Yang-kang as governor of Taiwan Province, and Lee Teng-hui as mayor
of Taipei City.

1979: Rhodesia takes the name Zimbabwe, with Bishop Abel Muzorewa
as its first black prime minister, ending 89 years of white rule.

1979: The Taiwan Provincial Government decides to raise NT$28.82
billion before 1980 for the construction of the South Link Railroad
which is planned for completion in December 1990. Upon completion of
the project, a trip around the island will take only a day.

1989: Lee Huan is sworn in as premier of the Republic of China.

1990: US President George Bush and Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev sign a bilateral agreement to stop producing chemical arms
and to start destroying existing stocks by the end of 1992.

Confucius' lesson of the day: "Pleasure derived from the study
and criticism of the polite arts, pleasure in admiring and speaking
of the excellent qualities of men, and pleasure in having many
friends of virtue and talent: these pleasures are beneficial."

AIR RAID DRILL SCHEDULED FOR WEDNESDAY

Taipei, June 1 (CNA) A pre-dawn air raid drill is scheduled to be
held in seven cities and counties in northern Taiwan on Wednesday, a
Ministry of National Defense (MND) spokesman said.

The spokesman said that the drill, dubbed Wan An No. 22, will
cover the areas of Taipei City, Taipei County, Ilan County, Keelung
City, Taoyuan County, Hsinchu City and Hsinchu County.

The 40-minute drill is set to begin at 5 a.m., featuring
contingency exercises by nuclear power plants and civil groups
conducting rescue and recovery operations.

The MND reminded the public to take note that those who are at
home are required to turn off all lights and electricity and then
quickly proceed to a basement or other shelter.

Pedestrians should follow the instructions of military or civil
defense personnel in moving to appropriate shelters.

Train travel will proceed normally, as well as vehicles on the
highway. However, vehicles are barred from leaving or entering a
highway during the drill. Ships docked in harbors will remain there
while ships that have not yet entered a harbor will not be allowed to
do so during the drill.

The Sungshan Airport in Taipei, CKS International Airport in
Taoyuan, and Hsiaokang Airport in Kaohsiung will operate normally.
Other flights at other airports will be subject to control, meaning
flights may land but not take off. Disembarking passengers will be
moved to the shelters immediately.</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>CANADIAN MINISTER WEEPS WHILE MARKING TIANANMEN MASSACRE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  May  31 (CNA)
(By S.C. CHANG)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Canadian minister broke down and wept as
he denounced the Communist Chinese government at a weekend ceremony
commemorating the 10th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square Massacre,
The Globe and Mail reported Monday.</P>
      <P>The Canadian newspaper quoted Raymond Chan, secretary of state
for Asia-Pacific, as telling a gathering in Vancouver, "Human dignity
and human lives are the most valuable things a nation has. No
government can justify killing its own people."</P>
      <P>With Tiananmen Square student leaders sitting nearby on Saturday,
Chan attacked Beijing's excuse that the crackdown was necessary to
maintain order, according to the Mail.</P>
      <P>Chan pointed out Deng Xiaoping had argued that it was worth
killing 200,000 people over 20 years if that was necessary to
maintain stability in the country, the daily reported.</P>
      <P>"That kind of barbaric statement is nonsense, and that's why it's
still important, 10 years later, to continue to have these kinds of
ceremonies to remember those who died and send a message that human
rights is important," Chan was quoted.</P>
      <P>At that point, Chan was overwhelmed by emotion and returned to
his seat, the Mail reported.</P>
      <P>Earlier, he said the Chinese government is changing in some areas
but "dissidents and human rights activists are still being
persecuted, rounded up and silenced, and we need to speak out for
them."</P>
      <P>Chan spoke at the University of British Columbia in front of a
replica of the Goddess of Democracy statue erected at Beijing's
Tiananmen Square in the spring of 1989 that came to symbolize the
Chinese citizens' pro-democracy movement.</P>

(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia's trade deficit in April hit a
record high of A$1.9 (US$1.27) billion due to less exports to
Asian countries and the devaluing of the local currency as financial
investors worried about the current account deficit.</P>
      <P>Federal Treasurer Peter Costello told parliament on Monday that
Australian exports are still affected by the Asian financial crisis
because its major trading partners, Japan and South Korea, imported
less.</P>
      <P>Figures released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics show
Australia's exports in April fell 6 percent from its March level
mainly due to the decline in its exports of commodity and transport

      <P>Former Taiwan Provincial Governor
James Soong on Monday declined to comment on whether he would run in
Taiwan's 2000 presidential election, saying only that he is mindful
of his supporters' encouragement and would never let them down.</P>
      <P>Soong flew to San Francisco on Monday at the invitation of the
US-based Asian Foundation and the University of California at
Berkeley. He was expected to deliver a speech on Tuesday at the
university on democracy in Taiwan in the 21st century.</P>
      <P>Dozens of Soong's supporters from the "Friends of Soong
Association" in the San Francisco Bay area came to the airport to
greet him and urged him to run for president.</P>
      <P>Soong thanked them for their support but did not say whether he
would run.</P>
      <P>Soong told members of the media at the airport that he would
announce his decision after fully considering the question once he
returns to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>His touring of various parts of Taiwan over the past three
months, though, suggests he is genuinely considering the possibility.</P>
      <P>Soong said that people hoping for social and political change
strongly support him and have expectations of him.</P>
      <P>He said he would work hard to meet their expectations for a
stable, prosperous, democratic and progressive Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Soong had a full schedule Tuesday. He was to meet with the Asian
Foundation and the mayor of San Francisco in the morning, and then
deliver a speech at the University of California at Berkeley. A
banquet was to be held in his honor in the evening.</P>
      <P>Although he is not currently a government official, Soong has
attracted a great deal of US attention and is considered a political
heavyweight.</P>
      <P>According to informed sources, the American Institute in Taiwan
requested that US authorities treat Soong with special courtesy

    <DATELINE>Washington,  May  31  (CNA)
(By Herman Pan and David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's economic growth rate in the
first nine years of this decade ranked ninth worldwide, while
mainland China ranked first in growth, according to data released
Monday by the World Bank (WB).</P>
      <P>The data showed that in the first nine years of the 1990s,
Taiwan's annual economic growth rate was 6.2 percent, while that of
mainland China was 11.2 percent.</P>
      <P>Worldwide the average annual economic growth rate from 1990 to
1998 was only 2.4 percent, lower than the preceding decade's average
annual growth rate of 3.2 percent. The main reason for the decrease
was Asia's financial turmoil in the second half of 1997, which
affected economic development worldwide, according to the bank.</P>
      <P>Bank data revealed that in the first nine years of the 1990s,
only six countries with a population of more than 3 million
registered annual economic growth of more than 6 percent.</P>
      <P>Mainland China, with an annual growth rate of 11.2 percent ranked
first, followed by Vietnam at 8 percent and Chile at 7.8 percent.</P>
      <P>Singapore was fourth at 7.5 percent, followed by Sudan at 7.4
percent, Ireland and Uganda both at 7.2 percent, and Malaysia at 6.9
percent.</P>
      <P>South Korea ranked 10th with an annual growth rate of 5.8
percent.</P>
      <P>The report also showed that the average annual economic growth
rate of the G7 countries from 1990 to 1998 period was about 2.2
percent. During that period the United States achieved annual growth
of 3.1 percent, while Japan's economy grew by only 1.2 percent
annually, as the country experienced its worst recession since World
War II.</P>
      <P>WB statistics also revealed that Taiwan's average annual
inflation rate in the first nine years of the 1990s stood at 3.2
percent. Among countries whose economies grew more than 5 percent
annually, Singapore registered the lowest average annual inflation
rate at 2.2 percent.</P>

    <DATELINE>Kinmen,  June  1  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei-based President Chain Store Corp.
opened its first 7-Eleven convenience store on the frontline island
of Kinmen on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The opening of the 24-hour store caused a stir in
the usually quiet offshore defense outpost, which lies closer to the
southeastern mainland Chinese coast than to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>A large crowd of young and adult consumers, including military
servicemen stationed on the island swarmed to the store to witness
its opening ceremony. A number of police officers were mobilized to
help maintain law and order.</P>
      <P>Hsu Chung-jen, the company's president, said President Chain
Store has opened the store mainly to serve garrison troops and
civilian residents on the remote offshore island.</P>
      <P>Despite higher transport costs, Hsu said, the company will not
raise retail prices for its products.</P>
      <P>Much to the surprise of President executives, the demand
for the company's brand-named foods, including rice balls,
sandwiches and shaved ice, was so high as all of them were sold out
in a few minutes.</P>
      <P>Some teenage consumers said they were excited by the opening of
the 7-Eleven store. A young conscript soldier said in the past he
often asked his parents in Taiwan to send him his favorite
7-Eleven trademark foods via express mail. "From now on, I need not
do so," he said with a radiant smile.</P>
      <P>To attract customers and celebrate the grand opening, the new
7-Eleven store has planned a series of promotional programs,
including a soft drinks drinking contest and offering give-away toys.</P>
      <P>Observers said the arrival of the round-the-clock convenience
store may herald a significant change in retail business on the
offshore frontline island.</P>

than 100 naval officers and enlisted men serving on the ship and
their families attended the ceremony.</P>
      <P>The "Cheng Hai" had served in the ROC Navy for 22 years, during
which time the ship had taken part in numerous transport and military
training missions.</P>
      <P>The dock landing ship, which could transport small vessels,
tanks, troops and cargoes, was originally christened "Fort Marion"
when it was serving in the US navy.</P>
      <P>Launched in 1945, the ship once took part in the Korean War in
the early 1950s. It also assisted in transporting goods between
Taiwan and its offshore frontline islands during the 1958 Battle of
the Taiwan Strait in which the Chinese communists fired on the
Taiwan-held Kinmen Islands.</P>
      <P>In 1977, the United States sold the ship to Taiwan. The ship had
since been christened "Cheng Hai." Over the past 22 years, the ship
had navigated more than 21,800 hours, with a total voyage of 159,100
nautical miles. A total of 15 captains once served on the ship.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC REPRESENTATIVE TO PHILIPPINES RETURNS TO TAIWAN</HEADLINE>

(By Wendy Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China (ROC) Representative to
the Philippines Chan Hsien-ching returned to Taiwan Tuesday afternoon
to report on Taiwan-Philippine relations at a Legislative Yuan
foreign relations committee meeting to be held Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan invited Chan to report on relations between
the two countries in light of Philippine Foreign Minister Domingo
Siazon's one-sided statement on April 18 regarding the denial of an
entry visa to ROC President Lee Teng-hui. The statement was issued
before Lee had decided whether to visit the country.</P>
      <P>Foreign wire services have reported that Filipino alumni of
Cornell University were planning to invite Lee to a private gathering
in late April. Taipei, however, has denied these reports.</P>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan considered the Philippine government's hasty
response gave a blow to the ROC government and its people, as well as
to relations between the two countries.</P>
      <P>The Philippine Presidential Office issued a second statement on
April 20 indicating that it had ruled out the possibility of granting
Lee a visa because of its "one China" policy and that the trip would
not be helpful to maintaining regional stability.</P>
      <P>In regard to the ROC's strong objections to the Philippine
Foreign Ministry's statement, the Philippine Presidential Office
issued another official statement on May 25 that pointed out that Lee
had not been denied a visa, since he had not applied for one or even
decided whether to attempt a visit to the country.</P>
      <P>The statement expressed Manila's hope that inaccurate reports
would not affect the Republic of China's relationship with the
Philippines. The statement also included calls for continued
developments and increased economic relations between the two
countries.</P>
      <P>Chan received an instruction from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
last Thursday asking him to attend the June 2 foreign relations
committee meeting.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN MACHINERY FOR PLASTIC PRODUCTS POPULAR AT PARIS EXPO</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Paris,  May  31  (CNA)
(By Tzou Ming-jhie and Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A total of 48 manufacturing companies from
Taiwan participated in an annual plastics-producing machinery
exposition that opened Monday in a northern suburb of Paris.</P>
      <P>Among more than 800 manufacturing companies from over 40
countries taking part in the exhibition, Taiwan's machinery makers
attracted much attention and interest from the French machinery
industry.</P>
      <P>The show, which is sponsored in turns by France, Germany and
Italy, is the largest of its kind in Europe and one of the most
important global exhibitions of machinery for the production of
plastics.</P>
      <P>Most machinery displayed by Taiwan companies fell into one of two
categories: machines with the capacity to project plastics products,
and those with the capacity to make products through the vacuum mold
production method.</P>
      <P>European plastics manufacturers expressed strong interest in the
Taiwan products on display, and it is expected that after the
five-day exposition, Taiwan-made machinery for the production of
plastics will be renowned in Europe.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is the world's fourth-largest producer of machinery to
make plastics, following the United States, Italy and Germany. In
terms of export volumes, Taiwan is the world's third-largest
producer, behind only Italy and Japan, said Tuan Enlei, director of
Taiwan Trade Service Inc. in Paris.</P>
      <P>The plastics industry has been a very prosperous business in
Taiwan. From the production of materials and machinery to
raw-materials processing, plastic mold research and development, and
commodity processing, Taiwan businesses are involved in all aspects
of plastics production. Tuan said that is rare among major
plastics-producing countries.</P>
      <P>Wang Cheng-chin, deputy director of the Taiwan Association of
Machinery Industry, is to attend a seminar held by the host of the
show. He will be interviewed by a magazine that covers the plastics
industry in France. Wang is expected to introduce Taiwan's success
story in the field of plastics-producing machinery production to
French readers.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFULS URGED TO PRESENT NATIONAL SECURITY POLICIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 1 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Several scholars and experts said on Tuesday
that presidential candidates should present substantial policy
statements on national security.</P>
      <P>They made the remarks when they attended a seminar sponsored by
Lung-chu Chen New Century Foundation on the upcoming presidential
election and national security strategies.</P>
      <P>Professor Chang Wu-chang of Tamkang University said that a
presidential candidate's national security policy should be
convincing, tested, workable and as well as open to debate.</P>
      <P>Chang also stressed that there should not be too much debate on
abstract ideas in regard to national security policies. The nation
should learn from the past and avoid during the presidential race
issues of ethnic rivalry and debates on unification.</P>
      <P>Professor Su Chin-chiang of Nanhua Management College described
the qualities of an ideal presidential candidate in regard to
national security.</P>
      <P>Su said that the ideal candidate should have the ability to deal
with emergencies, to lead the armed forces and to present a clear
policy on the nation's military buildup.</P>
      <P>He said that candidates should, without going into details, be
clear in the direction of their national security policies and offer
voters explanations in a plain language to win their trust.</P>
      <P>Of the four presidential hopefuls, only former Taipei Mayor Chen
Shui-bian has presented some of his opinions, he said. The others,
Vice President Lien Chan, former Taiwan Provincial Governor James
Soong and former Democratic Progressive Party Chairman Hsu
Hsin-liang, have yet to express their views.</P>
      <P>Lien has the most experience in dealing with defense matters and
that gives him an edge over other candidates, he said. But it remains
to be seen whether he has substantial policies to offer, he added.</P>
      <P>Legislator Chang Chun-hsiung of the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party said that presidential candidates should present
ideas on new national defense and security measures, conduct reforms
on military institutions and establish friendly relations with
mainland China so as to avoid confrontations resulting from
misjudgment.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MANDARIN DOMINANT LANGUAGE FOR MOST CHINESE STUDENTS IN SINGAPORE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  June  1  (CNA)
(By Sherman Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mandarin is the dominant language for
most Chinese students, with over six in 10 saying they spoke mainly
Mandarin in school and at home in Singapore, according to a survey
commissioned by The Straits Times on students' attitudes toward the
language.</P>
      <P>In contrast, English was used by only about one-third of students
when speaking to their classmates. At home, English was the main
language for about a quarter of pupils.</P>
      <P>Many of the students polled in the survey also said they watched
Chinese television programs and read Chinese magazines and
newspapers.</P>
      <P>They also scored better in Chinese than in English. Fifty-five
percent of primary school students polled and 64 percent of those in
secondary school said they managed better grades in their mother
tongue than in English.</P>
      <P>Six in 10 secondary school students spend more time on Chinese
than English. But for primary school students, just over half spend
more time on English than Chinese.</P>
      <P>The survey, conducted by telephone during the first week of May,
covered 725 Chinese pupils.</P>
      <P>Half of the students from English-speaking homes find learning
Chinese "difficult or very difficult," the survey said.</P>
      <P>In contrast, the majority of the student population find the
subject "easy or very easy" to cope with in school, the survey noted.</P>
      <P>The findings suggest that more students could have problems
coping with the Chinese language as the proportion of
English-speaking homes rises in the future.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC PREMIER MEETS SALVADORAN PRESIDENT-ELECT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>San  Salvador,  May  31  (CNA)
(By C. P. Huang and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>ROC Premier Vincent Siew met with
Salvadoran President-elect Francisco Flores on Monday for
wide-ranging talks.</P>
      <P>Siew forwarded to Flores a personal letter from ROC President Lee
Teng-hui. In his letter, Lee congratulated Flores on his election as
new Salvadoran president.</P>
      <P>Flores will be sworn in as new Salvadoran head of state on
Tuesday. And Siew will attend Flores' inauguration ceremony on
behalf of President Lee.</P>
      <P>During their talks, Flores, a former speaker of the Salvadoran
parliament, said he has fond memory of his meeting with Lee when Lee
made a state visit to El Salvador two years ago.</P>
      <P>Flores assured Siew that he will continue promoting cooperation
with the Republic of China after assuming office. He promised to
travel to Taipei in September to attend a summit meeting between the
ROC and six Central American countries, including El Salvador.</P>
      <P>Flores also expressed keen interest in signing a proposed free
trade agreement between the ROC and its five Central American
allies. The proposed pact is a major topic to be discussed in the
September summit meeting.</P>
      <P>Siew is accompanied by a large delegation of government
officials and senior business executives on his current 10-day,
three-nation Central American visit.</P>
      <P>During talks with senior Taiwan business executives, Siew said
he earnestly hopes Taiwan companies will be more active and
aggressive in launching investment projects in El Salvador and other
Central American countries that maintain longstanding diplomatic
ties with the ROC.</P>
      <P>Siew said he has ordered the Ministry of Economic Affairs to set
up a special task force to seek investment and joint-venture
opportunities in Central America to facilitate Taiwan entrepreneurs'
penetration of the Central American market.</P>
      <P>Noting that the North and South Americas will certainly
become a single market in the next century, Siew said Taiwan
companies should set up footholds in Central America as early as
possible in order to gain access into the vast North and Latin
American markets.</P>
      <P>Siew said he has spared no effort to encourage Taiwan banks to
open branches in Central America to help resolve financing problems
for Taiwan investors.</P>
      <P>According to Siew, El Salvador has granted the green light to
Taiwan's First Commercial Bank to set up a branch in San Salvador.
If all goes smoothly, the branch will begin operations in
October.</P>
      <P>First Commercial Bank Chairman Huang Tien-lin, who accompanies
Siew on his Central American visit, said the bank is also
considering opening a branch in Guatemala.</P>
      <P>Central America is one of the ROC's diplomatic stronghold as
many of its diplomatic allies are located in the region. As part
of its efforts to cement ties with these countries, the ROC
government has been encouraging Taiwan business people to invest
more in the region.</P>
      <P>With the assistance of the ROC government, major Taiwan
business groups have pooled resources to set up a Latin America
investment holding company.</P>
      <P>After extensive market research, the joint-venture holding
company will launch its first investment project in Central
America on Wednesday -- a garment plant in Nicaragua.</P>
      <P>An agreement on the new investment project will be signed in
Nicaragua's capital on Wednesday, said Ho Yu, president of the
joint-venture holding company. The new garment plant will have a
paid-in capital of US$8.5 million.</P>
      <P>Ho said the company's next plan is to seek the opportunity to
open a food processing plant in El Salvador. Meanwhile, the company
also plans to invest in tourist and recreational industries in Costa
Rica.</P>
      <P>El Salvador is the second leg of Siew's current Central American
visit, which will also take him to Saint Christopher and Nevis in
the Caribbean. Siew already visited Guatemala before coming to San
Salvador.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  1  (CNA)
(By David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The emerging field of gene engineering
technology can reduce the time needed for the research and
development (R&amp;D) of new drugs and associated R&amp;D risks, said Hsu
Li-chih, a member of Academia Sinica, the nation's highest academic
research institution, on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Hsu, one of the organizers of the Canadian Gene Disease Net
(CGDN), arrived in Taipei with CGDN's executive general, Ron Woznow,
on Monday to raise funds for the net in a bid to promote the
diagnosis and treatment of gene diseases.</P>
      <P>Hsu said he and Woznow plan to raise US$5 million to US$10
million in Taiwan to invest in the development of gene engineering
technology. The gene disease net needs at least US$25 million, he
said.</P>
      <P>Hsu has called on some government officials and businessmen to
provide monetary assistance.</P>
      <P>Major pharmaceutical-producing plants in the United States and
Canada generally need to spend eight years on R&amp;D testing of new
drugs before releasing them onto the market, he said, adding that R&amp;D
costs are often as high as US$500 million, which leads to a sharp
decline in profits.</P>
      <P>Emerging gene engineering technology can shorten R&amp;D time and
lower associated risks, he said. If R&amp;D times could be shortened by
even one day, drug manufacturers could save US$5 million to US$10
million in R&amp;D expenditures.</P>
      <P>Hsu said Taiwan manufacturers can develop bio-technology through
investing in CGDN and joining in the development of gene engineering
technology. A tremendous income can be generated by participating in
this field, he said.</P>

      <P>The Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) on
Tuesday confirmed reports that its mainland Chinese counterpart has
invited SEF officials to visit mainland China in late June for talks
to arrange a Taiwan trip by mainland China's top envoy to the
Republic of China.</P>
      <P>But SEF Secretary-General Shi Huei-yow said the date chosen by
the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) --
June 22-24 -- is inconvenient, because the SEF is already scheduled
to sponsor a large-scale Dragon Boat Festival activity in Taipei for
mainland-based Taiwan businessmen at that time.</P>
      <P>Shi said he has discussed the matter with the Mainland Affairs
Council, which oversees SEF operations, and added that SEF officials
are willing to travel to mainland China at any time except June 22.</P>
      <P>Shi proposed that ARATS suggest another time to continue their
talks if the organization is sincere in wishing to promote bilateral
exchanges.</P>
      <P>In response to an ice-breaking visit by SEF Chairman Koo Chen-fu
to mainland China last October, ARATS Chairman Wang Daohan has
promised to visit Taiwan this autumn. SEF and ARATS officials have
held several rounds of preparatory talks since the beginning of this

    <HEADLINE>KOO OPTIMISTIC ABOUT MAINLAND ENVOY'S VISIT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 1 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's top negotiator with mainland China
on Tuesday expressed optimism about his mainland counterpart's
planned visit to Taiwan later this year.</P>
      <P>"I believe Wang Daohan, president of the Beijing-based
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS), will
certainly visit Taiwan this autumn," said Koo Chen-fu, chairman of
Taipei's Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF).</P>
      <P>Koo, a veteran business tycoon and a senior adviser to President
Lee Teng-hui, made the optimistic forecast during a meeting with
a Legislative Yuan subgroup, which is mainly composed of
legislators from the ruling Kuomintang.</P>
      <P>Wang promised to make a reciprocal visit to Taiwan this
spring when he met Koo in Shanghai last October. However, Wang later
changed his schedule and agreed to visit Taiwan this autumn.</P>
      <P>Some lawmakers said they were worried that Wang, a former
Shanghai mayor and mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin's mentor,
may once again break his promise.</P>
      <P>Koo said he doesn't think so. "I'm confident that Wang will come
to Taiwan this fall," he added.</P>
      <P>As to the agenda for the Taipei round of Koo-Wang talks, Koo
said he hopes Wang will not confine the agenda to certain sensitive
or controversial topics.</P>
      <P>"Such a practice would only narrow the scope of our discussions
and will do no good to relations across the Taiwan Strait," Koo
said, adding that he is willing to frankly exchange views with Wang
on any matters of mutual concern.</P>
      <P>Koo also urged mainland China to face up to the political and
historical reality that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait are now
ruled by two separate governments.</P>
      <P>"Cross-strait talks and relations can make significant progress
only when Beijing treats Taipei on an equal footing," Koo said,
adding that Beijing's attempts to downgrade the ROC government as a
local government are the biggest obstacle to cross-strait
rapprochement.</P>
      <P>Turning to the US proposal that the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait sign interim agreements on certain thorny issues before they
can finally resolve their disputes, Koo said he does not oppose the
idea.</P>
      <P>Koo said he thinks "interim agreements" can be signed to address
practical issues related to the rights and interests of the people on
both sides of the Taiwan Strait. Nevertheless, Koo said it hinges on
mainland China's attitude whether the proposed "interim agreements"
can be signed or implemented.</P>
      <P>Koo said the most important thing at the moment is that the two
sides forge mutual trust. Therefore, Koo said Beijing should abide
by the agreements reached in the first Koo-Wang meeting held in
Singapore in April in 1993. "Otherwise, it will be to no avail to
discuss any interim or permanent agreements," he added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The results of a recent government
investigation show that there are more male than female drug addicts
in Taiwan, and that amphetamine is the narcotic of choice for most of
them.</P>
      <P>Quoting reports from hospitals islandwide, the investigation
carried out by the Narcotics Bureau under the cabinet-level
Department of Health (DOH) shows that a total of 1,471 drug users
received treatment for drug abuse during the second half of 1998, 80
percent of whom were male.</P>
      <P>Amphetamine and heroin were the most-abused narcotics, with 38.5
percent and 34.4 percent, respectively, of the drug users addicted
to them. Some 11.8 percent favored sleeping pills such as hypnotics
and soporifics, while 7 percent addicted to glue-sniffing.</P>
      <P>Youths aged between 20 and 35 accounted for the largest group of
abusers -- 67.8 percent -- and as many as 45.2 percent cited friends
as their most frequent providers of narcotics. About 15.5 percent
said they obtained drugs through "other means," ahead of 13 percent
who purchased narcotics from pushers.</P>
      <P>Injection was the most frequent method of administration used by
30.9 percent of the total drug users, with 5.6 percent of them saying
they shared needles with other users. Some 28.2 percent said they
sniffed the fumes given off by heating the drugs, while 18 percent
said they smoked their drugs.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the DOH announced that it is planning to establish a
comprehensive monitoring system for drug abuse by joining forces with
communities and schools islandwide.</P>
      <P>The DOH said in an annual anti-drug report that it plans to work
with regional hospitals and communities to strengthen its monitoring
of drug addicts released from hospitals, and will also cooperate with
the Ministry of Education to set up monitoring systems in schools
islandwide to crack down on drug abuse among the nation's youth.</P>
      <P>The DOH also plans to work with the Ministry of Justice to
establish rehabilitation centers at 145 hospitals across the island,
and to train more personnel to help drug addicts shake their habits,
according to the report. Since 1994, 4,451 people have received such
training, 1,533 of whom are practicing physicians.</P>

      <P>Anti-smoking experts from the Asia-Pacific
region agreed unanimously on Tuesday that a smoke-free environment
should be created for teenagers to help them say "No" to cigarettes.</P>
      <P>The agreement came at the close of a two-day conference of the
Asia Pacific Association for the Control of Tobacco (APACT) which was
held in Taipei. Attendees from countries in the region meet every
three years to discuss issues related to tobacco taxation and
building a smoke-free environment for the younger generation.</P>
      <P>Surveys show that 55 percent of Taiwan's male adult population
smoke, as well as over 30 percent of males over the age of 19. Most
of them started smoking during their teenage years.</P>
      <P>A Department of Health (DOH) official said the government is
gradually creating a smoke-free environment through law enactment,
counseling and anti-smoking education; teenagers under 18 are not
allowed to smoke, nor are stores allowed to sell them cigarettes.</P>
      <P>Professor Chen Chien-jen from National Taiwan University's school
of epidemiology pointed out that teenagers become habitual smokers
after smoking for just one year, making it more difficult for them to
quit when they are adults.</P>
      <P>Chen said it is the responsibility of the government and society
to prevent teenagers from taking up the habit, and that prevention
measures should be carried out in all aspects of teenagers' lives.</P>
      <P>Scott Baldwin, one of the first attorneys in the United States to
win lawsuits against tobacco companies, said Taiwan should seek
compensation from American tobacco companies, and not let the fear of
US trade retaliation sacrifice the health of its people.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A French resident of Taiwan has suggested to
the Taipei Rapid Transit Corporation (TRTC) that balloons be
prohibited on the city's mass rapid transport system after being
startled by a child bursting balloons on one of the trains.</P>
      <P>TRTC officials pointed out that since many of the mass transit
lines have their destinations at the popular scenic spots frequented
by souvenir vendors, families often travel on the trains, and it is
not unusual for children to bring balloons aboard.</P>
      <P>The officials admitted that the sound of balloons popping might
shock other passengers, and could even cause accidents, with stray
balloons posing an added hidden danger to mass transit facilities.</P>
      <P>However, despite the dangers involved, the TRTC said, banning the
balloons might cause "a negative reaction," although it added that
instructions have been issued to station managers to "persuade"
passengers not to bring balloons on board.</P>
      <P>The incident has sparked enthusiastic debate on the Internet,
with some people agreeing that balloons should be banned, and others
saying that such a move would restrict peoples' freedom, and that the
next step would be a ban on the rubber menaces in places such as
amusement parks.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT HAS BODY OF 60-YEAR-OLD: DOCTOR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  1  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Lee Teng-hui, now 77 years old,
has the body of a 60-year-old, and is in extremely good health, his
chief physician at National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH) said on
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Lee and his wife had just undergone a routine physical, the
results of which indicate that both the Republic of China's president
and his wife are very healthy, said Dr. Lien Wen-pin.</P>
      <P>The president is actually in better shape than he was in 1997
when he received his last physical, said Lien, citing the facts that
Lee's spinal bone matrix is more solid than that of a much younger
man, his blood sugar level is normal, and even a stone on his left
kidney has disappeared.</P>
      <P>The Lees checked into NTUH at 8 a.m. and were discharged from the
medical center at 5:50 p.m.</P>
      <P>According to the examination results, Lee now stands 179 cm tall,
one centimeter shorter than in 1997, but he has gained six kilograms
over the last two years, bringing his weight to 76 kg.</P>
      <P>He has a blood pressure reading of 136-70 -- quite healthy for a
man of his age, and although he has slow degeneration of his right
shoulder, Lee is still full of energy, Lien said, adding that the
president apparently has no problem with his golf game, and can play
27 holes in a single outing.</P>
      <P>As Lee's doctor, Lien suggested that the president slow his
public life down a bit, take more rest, do more exercise and get more
sunshine.</P>
      <P>As for Mrs. Lee, Lien said the first lady is also in better shape
than most women her age, apart from two tiny seeds in her thyroid
gland, a condition which requires no treatment.</P>
      <P>A small gallstone has dissolved, and her bone matrix is also more
solid than average, Lien noted.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN INVESTMENT CORP. INVESTS US$30 MILLION IN THAILAND</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Bangkok,  June  1  (CNA)
(By Kuo Fang-chih and Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's Southeast Asia Investment Corp.
(SAIC) Chairman Liu Tai-ying on Tuesday signed an agreement with Thai
Finance Ministry Permanent Secretary Supachai Pisitvanich to invest
US$30 million in Thailand's TISCO Finance Public Company Ltd.</P>
      <P>The investment is a part of TISCO's increasing capitalization
program. The leading finance management company of Thailand plans to
issue 600 million more shares to collect additional capital of 6
billion baht (US$162.12 million).</P>
      <P>The Thai government will buy half of the new stocks, with private
enterprises sharing the rest, according to TISCO, whose business
covers commercial banking, securities brokerage, and leasing
services.</P>
      <P>During Tuesday's signing ceremony, Liu, who also chairs the China
Development Industrial Bank (CDIB), said that with the signing of the
agreement, both the SAIC and CDIB will enhance cooperation with their
new Thai partner to expand their financial and business operations in
the Southeast Asian country.</P>
      <P>Asked why they have chosen to dump money in a country battered by
the Asian financial storm, Liu explained that the Thai economy is
recovering under the government's efficient financial reforms.
Bangkok's measures to deal with the financial crisis are in the right
direction, and this has helped foreign investors to regain confidence
in the country, he added.</P>
      <P>Since the outbreak of the regional financial crisis two years
ago, the SAIC and CDIB have invested US$120 million in Thailand by
merging with local companies, especially banks and financial
businesses, Liu said, revealing that their total investment in
Thailand will grow to US$200 million by the end of this year.</P>
      <P>Liu is scheduled to return to Taiwan on Wednesday after his
two-day stay in Bangkok.</P>

(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Canberra, June 1 (CNA): Kingstream Steel Co. of western Australia
is working to buy back almost 331 million shares from its Taiwanese
former partner -- An Feng Steel Co. -- following the abortive joint
venture between the two sides due to financial trouble of the
Kaohsiung-based firm.</P>
      <P>Kingstream Chairman Ken Court on Monday told his shareholders at
an annual general that the buyback of An Feng's shares in the
abortive venture would clear a big hurdle for the Australian company
and eventually pave the way for a 100 percent control of the US$1
billion Midwest Iron and Steel (MIS) project, according to a report
by the Australian Associated Press (AAP).</P>
      <P>He said Kingstream planned to cancell all the shares held by the
financially stricken An Feng as it attempts to revive development of
the MIS project, east of Geraldton in western Australia, according to
the AAP.</P>
      <P>However, a further 104.9 million shares would remain off limits
because they are still on the hand of An Feng's creditors in Taiwan,
Court told his shareholders.</P>
      <P>But the buyback of the An Feng's shares would pave the way for
future acquisition of other shares now being held by Taiwanese
creditors, he said.</P>
      <P>The buyback of An Feng's shares will be made in "a few months,"
he said.</P>
      <P>"This is a very positive move, because ... now we can move ahead
to finalise the funding package," Court said, adding that Kingstream
was negotiating with its financiers now.</P>
      <P>Court was not available for comment on Tuesday.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Premier Vincent Siew
on Tuesday attended the inauguration of Salvadoran President
Francisco Flores on behalf of ROC President Lee Teng-hui.</P>
      <P>The ROC was one of 54 nations to send a delegation to celebrate
Flores' inauguration as president of the Central American nation.</P>
      <P>Foreign heads of state attending the ceremony included Costa
Rican President Miguel Angel Rodriguez, Nicaraguan President Arnoldo
Aleman, Guatemalan President Alvaro Arzu, Honduran President Carlos
Flores and Panamanian President Ernesto Perez Balladarez.</P>
      <P>On Monday, Siew met with Flores for wide-ranging talks, during
the course of which Siew passed on a personal letter from the ROC
president to Flores.</P>
      <P>Flores assured Siew that he will continue promoting cooperation
with the ROC after assuming office. He promised to travel to Taipei
in September to attend a summit meeting between the ROC, El Salvador,
and several other Central American countries.</P>
      <P>Flores also expressed keen interest in signing a proposed free
trade agreement between the ROC and its five Central American allies.
The proposed pact will be a major topic of the September summit
meeting.</P>
      <P>Siew is accompanied by a large delegation of government officials
and senior business executives on his current 10-day, three-nation
Central American visit.</P>
      <P>During talks with senior Taiwan business executives, Siew said he
earnestly hopes Taiwan companies will be more active and aggressive
in launching investment projects in El Salvador and other Central
American countries that maintain longstanding diplomatic ties with
the ROC.</P>
      <P>Siew said he has ordered the Ministry of Economic Affairs to set
up a special task force to seek investment and joint-venture
opportunities in Central America to facilitate Taiwan entrepreneurs'
penetration of the Central American market.</P>
      <P>Central America is one of the ROC's diplomatic stronghold as many
of its diplomatic allies are located in the region. As part of its
efforts to cement ties with these countries, the ROC government has
been encouraging Taiwan business people to invest more in the region.</P>
      <P>El Salvador is the second leg of Siew's current Central American
visit, which will also take him to Saint Christopher and Nevis in the
Caribbean. Siew already visited Guatemala before coming to San
Salvador.</P>
      <P>Siew later in the day also met with the heads of state from
Nicaragua, Panama and Costa Rica, which are also the ROC's diplomatic
allies in the Latin American region</P>

      <P>Taiwan Mayor Ma Ying-jeou will personally
lead a group of Taiwan artists to the 48th Esposizione Internazionale
d'Arte La Biennale di Venezia, a biennial art exhibition that will
open in the Italian city of Venice on June 12, sources from the
Taipei Fine Arts Museum said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Three Taiwan artists, Buh-ching Hwang, Chieh-jen Chen and Tung-lu
Hung, will jointly exhibit their contemporary art under a theme of
"Toward An Openness" at the Palace of Prigioni in downtown Venice.</P>
      <P>It will be the third time that Taiwan artists have taken part in
the illustrious biennial art show since 1995.</P>
      <P>This year's show, with a general theme of "APERTO overALL," will
be a showcase of contemporary art masterpieces from around the world
under the direction of world-renowned curator Harald Szeeman.</P>
      <P>Hundreds of artists from 59 nations and areas will be taking part
in the exhibition, the most expensive biennial art show ever staged.
Compared with previous shows and other exhibitions, this year's one
is expected to be more global, though there will be no work from
African artists on display, and there will be more video pieces and
fewer traditional paintings and sculptures.</P>
      <P>According to the Taipei Fine Arts Museum, the artistic works of
Hwang, mostly paintings, reflect the shift of Taiwanese society from
conservative, inhibited and dull to liberal, open and vibrant.</P>
      <P>Chen meanwhile is a determined outsider who uses computer and
image-processing software to create his works, and he will show off
pieces that neatly integrate traditional methods of drawing and
photographic collages using computer technology.</P>
      <P>As for Hung, the artist will put out "installations" using the
"simple formula of iconographic language," according to a statement.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC GOVERNMENT TO CONTINUE WITH `GO SOUTH' POLICY: CEPD HEAD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>San  Salvador,  June  1  (CNA)
(By C.P. Huang and Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ROC government will continue
promoting its "go south" policy, despite its call for Taiwan
businesses to invest in Central America, a top ROC economic planning
official said here on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>P.K. Chiang, chairman of the Cabinet-level Council for Economic
Planning and Development (CEPD), said the government policy of urging
Taiwan firms to invest in Southeast Asian countries does not
contradict its call for Taiwan enterprises to invest in Central
America, and that there is no need to adjust the southward investment
policy.</P>
      <P>Chiang claimed that the "go south" policy will not lose its
importance, although the ROC government is pushing for a greater
number of Taiwan companies to set up strongholds in Central America.</P>
      <P>Currently, Taiwan investment in Southeast Asia totals more than
US$40 billion, and the "go south" policy will help further strengthen
Taiwan's substantive ties with countries in that region, Chiang
noted.</P>
      <P>In addition to Southeast Asia and mainland China, the ROC
government is also actively encouraging Taiwan businesses to tap the
Central American market, and is providing them with handsome
incentives, said the CEPD head, who is currently accompanying ROC
Premier Vincent Siew on a Central American tour.</P>
      <P>Because of the region's proximity to North and South America,
Chiang said Taiwan companies should consider breaking into the
Central American market, which is rife with business opportunities,
as soon as possible. This would not only help create more job
opportunities in the host countries, it would also help Taiwan to
cement ties with those countries, he added.</P>
      <P>Speaking of a move by the First Commercial Bank and the
International Commercial Bank of China to open branches in the
region, Chiang expressed the belief that Taiwan businesses with
operations in Central America will be able to enjoy credit at
favorable interest rates.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LOWER EXPORTS PUSH UP AUSTRALIA'S CURRENT ACCOUNT DEFICIT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  June 2 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia's current account deficit (CAD)
surged to a record high of A$8.9 billion (US$5.93 billion) in the
first quarter of 1999, pushing the country's net foreign debt to an
all-time high of A$241.6 billion (US$161.1 billion), and some
economists have predicted the figures could swell further in the
coming months.</P>
      <P>The first-quarter CAD reached about 5.9 percent of Australia's
gross domestic product, the highest level since fiscal 1994-95, when
it reached 6.6 percent, according to figures released Tuesday by the
Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS).</P>
      <P>Australia's first-quarter net foreign debt represents a rise of
A$2.6 billion (US$1.73 billion) from the fourth quarter of 1998. But
the servicing ratio was steady at a 15-year low of 9.6 percent,
according to the ABS.</P>
      <P>Federal Treasurer Peter Costello attributed the surging CAD and
foreign debt to lower exports due to the lingering impact of the
Asian financial crisis. But he said the CAD figure was consistent
with government forecasts of 5.5 percent in fiscal 1998-99, which
ends June 30.</P>

Democracy China-Ottawa will hold a candle vigil and wreath ceremony
outside the mainland Chinese Embassy in Ottawa on the evening of June
4 to mark the 10th anniversary of the Tiananmen Massacre.</P>
      <P>Paula Kelsall, a spokeswoman for AI Canada, said Tuesday that 10
years after hundreds of unarmed civilians were killed by the People's
Liberation Army, the mainland Chinese government still has not
accounted for those killed, injured or arrested, and it still
maintains that the peaceful protests were a "counter-revolutionary
riot."</P>
      <P>Amnesty International has records of 241 prisoners who are still
in jail or on medical parole and serving long sentences in connection
with the events, she added.</P>
      <P>She said members of AI Canada and Democracy China-Ottawa will
honor those who died with a special wreath of white chrysanthemums,
the color of mourning in mainland China, and will call for the
release of those still being held.</P>
      <P>Last week Amnesty International stated that "the time is ripe for
the Chinese authorities to give a final and complete account of all
those killed and injured during the crackdown, to compensate the
victims and their relatives, and to release those still imprisoned
for their role in the 1989 pro-democracy protests."</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC ENVOY REPORTS ON TIES WITH PHILIPPINES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  2 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>ROC Representative to the Philippines Chan
Hsien-ching on Wednesday urged the Philippine government to respect
the Republic of China's stance while handling relations with the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Chan, who returned to Taipei on Tuesday for home consultations,
made the call in a report to the Legislative Yuan's Foreign Affairs
Committee.</P>
      <P>Noting that the Philippine government's recent handling of a
proposed visit to the Philippines by President Lee Teng-hui has hurt
the ROC's national dignity, Chan said he hopes a similar situation
will not occur again.</P>
      <P>Chan said Filipino alumni of Cornell University originally
planned to invite Lee to a private gathering in the Philippines in
late April. Lee has a doctoral degree in agricultural economy from
the prestigious American university.</P>
      <P>Chan said the Philippine government first approved the
invitation. At that point, Chan said, the ROC government was still
mulling whether to accept the invitation. However, as soon as it
heard about the planned invitation, Beijing began to pressure the
Philippine government to deny Lee an entry visa.</P>
      <P>On April 20, the Philippine Presidential Office issued a
statement saying Lee's Philippines visit would not be helpful to
maintaining regional stability. The statement apparently ruled out
the possibility of Lee being issued a visa.</P>
      <P>The following day, ROC Foreign Minister Jason Hu expressed his
strong dissatisfaction with the Philippine government's unfriendly
move, saying its premature announcement "was unnecessary and
inappropriate."</P>
      <P>Chan said he had unequivocally conveyed the ROC's stance on the
issue to the Philippine government. As a result, the Philippine
Presidential Office issued another statement on May 25 that pointed
out that Lee had not been denied a visa, since he had not applied for
one, and nor had he even decided whether to visit the Philippines.</P>
      <P>Chan said the latest statement signified Manila's hope that the
incident will not affect the bilateral relationship.</P>
      <P>In fact, Chan said, the incident had caused concern among many
Philippine congressmen, and the foreign relations committee of the
Philippine House of Representatives convened a hearing to discuss the
event.</P>
      <P>Chan said a number of Philippine congressmen have criticized
their government for its sloppy handling of the issue. They said the
Philippines has benefited greatly from its engagements with the ROC,
particularly in trade, investment, bank loans, tourism and labor
policy. They also demanded that the Philippine government review its
"one China" policy and adopt effective measures to reinforce
substantive ties with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chan said Philippine authorities appreciate the treatment Taiwan
extends to the large number of Filipino workers on the island.</P>
      <P>"The Philippine government also intends to expand mutually
beneficial economic relations with Taiwan," Chan said, adding that
Philippine officials hope to attract more Taiwan entrepreneurs to
invest in hog raising and aquaculture in northern Luzon, the largest
of the Philippine Islands.</P>
      <P>Chan further said the Philippines intends to cooperate with
Taiwan in developing its northern seaports to shorten Taiwan-bound
navigation time.</P>
      <P>The Philippines diplomatically recognizes Beijing while
maintaining close substantive ties with the ROC.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN FUELING REVIVAL IN SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New   York,   June   1   (CNA)
(By J.J. Huang and Amanda Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>After a three-year slump, the
semiconductor industry is experiencing a revival, largely as a result
of Taiwan companies serving as original equipment manufacturers
(OEMs), according to a report Tuesday in The Wall Street Journal.</P>
      <P>OEM production accounted for just 8 percent of total production
in the industry last year, though the figure is expected to rise
within one or two years to 13 percent. And this growth will
ultimately reflect growth in the industry, according to the paper.</P>
      <P>The sale of semiconductor products is expected to grow 9 percent
in 1999, slightly lower than last year's 11-percent growth, the paper
said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the sale of equipment used to manufacture
semiconductors is experiencing single-digit growth, compared to last
year's decline of 24 percent as Taiwan companies have placed
significant orders for new equipment.</P>
      <P>US-based General Instrument Co., the biggest producer of
semiconductor manufacturing equipment, told the paper that Taiwan
companies accounted for 20 percent of its total sales last year, and
are expected to account for 25 percent this year.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's largest two semiconductor manufacturers, Taiwan
Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and United Micro Electronics, have
each invested US$1.3 billion in new projects. This contrasts sharply
with the picture last year, when the market was suffering from a
slump in demand.</P>
      <P>The paper attributed the two Taiwan companies' improved
performance to constant technological innovation, which has enabled
them to compete against Intel and to weather the recent global
economic downturn.</P>
      <P>Although dynamic random access memory (DRAM) modules used to be
what fueled the industry's growth, the industry is now focusing on
producing chips for Internet-related products and consumer devices,
as well as for personal computers, the paper noted.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN'S F-16S GROUNDED IN WAKE OF RECENT CRASHES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 2 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China Air Force on Wednesday
grounded all of its newly acquired F-16 jet fighters for safety
checks in the wake of another accident of the advanced warplane on
Tuesday evening.</P>
      <P>The single-seater F-16, piloted by Squadron Leader Major Hsu
Chun-wei, went missing during a night training mission about 35
kilometers southwest of Green Island off the coast of southeastern
Taiwan at around 8:12 p.m.</P>
      <P>Marine police rescue units from nearby Taitung City reported by
Wednesday noon that pink oil residue suspected to be from a military
plane had been spotted on the ocean surface near Green Island.</P>
      <P>Air force personnel speculated that the F-16 fighter's ECS
control system malfunctioned when the cockpit's pressurization system
broke down, causing the pilot to black out and lose control of the
fighter. Similar accidents have been reported by the United States
Air Force, according to air force sources.</P>
      <P>This is the third accident involving the high-performance jet
fighters since 150 F-16 MLU (midlife upgrade) fighters began to be
delivered from the United States to Taiwan one year and three months
ago.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of National Defense announced on Tuesday that
initial rescue efforts will continue for 72 hours, and that the
search will go on for three months if there is no immediate success.</P>
      <P>After two air force night surveillance rescue helicopters were
deployed throughout Tuesday night without finding anything, navy
frigates and other vessels also joined the rescue mission on
Wednesday morning. As of press time, no sign of the fighter or the
pilot has been found.</P>
      <P>An ROC Air Force statement said the 34-year-old Hsu is a member
of Squadron 41 of Chiayi Air Force Base in southern Taiwan, and was
engaged on a night training mission in eastern Taiwan. The fighter
took off from Hualien's Chiashan Base at about 7:44 p.m. on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>At 8:29 p.m., the air force confirmed that the fighter was
missing, and launched a rescue operation at around 8:40 p.m.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Kuomintang Legislator Ting Shou-chung urged the US
manufacturer of the aircraft to provide Taiwan with complete
literature and reports about the jet fighters to see whether the
plane's functions are well-developed or not.</P>
      <P>Ting also called for the air force to increase F-16 pilots'
simulation training time and expand simulation training categories
before they are actually allowed to fly the planes. "Taiwan's air
force and personnel resources cannot afford any more losses like
this," Ting stressed.</P>
      <P>A two-seater F-16 with its crew of two disappeared in the
vicinity of the offshore island of Penghu in March last year, and on
Jan. 25 this year, another two-seater F-16 crashed in a mountainous
area of Taitung, eastern Taiwan, killing the two crewmen.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CPC WILL NOT ADJUST OIL PRICES IN NEAR FUTURE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  2 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's state-run Chinese Petroleum Corp.
(CPC) said on Wednesday that although its crude oil import costs in
May had increased to US$14.95 per barrel from US$12.3 the previous
month, the company does not intend to adjust its oil prices.</P>
      <P>The state monopoly has raised prices for its various oil-derived
products twice -- on April 7 and on May 12 -- since the beginning of
this year due to an upward spiral in international crude oil prices
because of the conflict in Yugoslavia.</P>
      <P>So far this year, the CPC has raised prices by a total of 5.49
percent.</P>
      <P>A CPC spokesman explained that the current domestic oil prices
are calculated on the criteria that imported crude oil costs US$12.5
per barrel on a new Taiwan dollar exchange rate of NT$32.74.</P>
      <P>However, the spokesman said, the CPC has decided to absorb the
additional costs itself in the near future, in order to maintain a
stable oil market.</P>
      <P>He also said that crude prices are expected to fall again soon.</P>
      <P>The current local retail price of premium gasoline is NT$16.8
(US$0.5) per liter, while the price of 95-unleaded gasoline is
NT$16.6 per liter; 92-unleaded gasoline is NT$15.6 per liter;
high-grade diesel is NT$12.1 per liter; and normal-grade diesel is
NT$10.9 per liter.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, CPC statistics show that on June 1, the first day on
the local market for 98-unleaded gasoline, 337 kiloliters were sold.
The fuel is more efficient and cleaner than other fuels on the
market, but can only be used in high-end cars.</P>
      <P>Sales accounted for 2 percent of that day's total CPC sales, the
statistics show. There are now 302 gas stations around the island
selling the new fuel.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FOREIGN POLICY ANALYST URGES CLINTON TO HEED COX REPORT SUGGESTIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington, June 1 (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Bill Clinton should follow the
Cox report's recommendations and improve US counterintelligence and
national security so as to head off potential conflict with mainland
China in the future, according to a senior American policy analyst.</P>
      <P>Richard D. Fisher Jr., director of the Asian Studies Center at
the Heritage Foundation, wrote Tuesday in an analysis that the
Clinton administration's failure to warn Congress and the American
people of the danger that Beijing's efforts to obtain military
technology to build modern nuclear missiles and other weapons could
threaten US security and challenge US interests in Asia "constitutes
a stunning lapse of leadership."</P>
      <P>Critics who downplay the seriousness of mainland China's actions
by saying "everyone does it" miss the point: US taxpayers will have
to bear the cost of new weapons to defend the United States against
new mainland Chinese missiles based on US technology already paid for
by Americans, noted Fisher.</P>
      <P>The policy analyst said the Cox report is a long-overdue wake-up
call for the Clinton administration and US allies to reassess
Beijing's intentions, to undertake a serious counterintelligence
campaign to protect the United States from mainland Chinese
espionage, and to develop effective missile defenses to blunt
mainland China's emerging missile capabilities.</P>
      <P>The most important impact of mainland China's espionage is its
ability to threaten the United States both directly and indirectly,
wrote Fisher. The Cox report warns that Beijing could use US
thermonuclear weapons and missile guidance technology to build new
modern intercontinental-range ballistic missiles with multiple
warheads that could cover the United States.</P>
      <P>Stolen US technology could also be used to endanger US satellites
and ballistic missile submarines that are critical to the United
States' nuclear deterrence efforts, he said.</P>
      <P>Indirect threats will come as a result of mainland China's
providing ballistic or cruise missiles or satellites based on US
technology to rogue states like Iran and North Korea, which are
trying to build nuclear missiles capable of reaching the United
States. The Cox report, moreover, states that Beijing is stealing
military technology on a vast scale to advance its goal: to retake
Taiwan and to replace the United States as the primary power in Asia.</P>
      <P>Fisher concluded that although mainland China does not pose a
threat like that of the former Soviet Union, the Cox committee
provides an essential warning of Beijing's potential future hostile
intent toward the United States and its friends in Asia.</P>
      <P>The Cox report recommendations include abandoning the notion that
mainland China is a "strategic partner" of the United States, a crash
program to improve counterintelligence, reviving multilateral
high-technology export controls, and accelerating the development of
missile defenses.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>NATO has given mainland China's leadership a
helping hand, just as it was facing demands for accountability in the
Tiananmen Square Massacre of 10 years ago, leading pro-democracy
activists said.</P>
      <P>Michael To, Frank Woo and Xu Shuiliang jointly issued a long
statement Tuesday to commemorate the tragic and bloody events in
Beijing of June 1989. To and Woo are spokesmen for the World Council
of Chinese Pro-democracy Organizations, and Xu is a renowned Chinese
dissident now exiled in the United States. Xu maintains close ties
with the Democratic Party of Zhejiang Province.</P>
      <P>"By using the pretext of the NATO bombs, the Chinese government
has effectively removed any possibility of pro-democracy demands on
the eve of the 10th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square Massacre,"
they said.</P>
      <P>Western values such as human rights and democracy -- values
championed by students and civilians 10 years ago -- "have no chance
at all in the current anti-West climate" in mainland China, they
noted.</P>
      <P>But they said they do not think the cultural gap between mainland
China and the West is as wide as that between the Christian and
Muslim worlds because the Confucian culture, deeply rooted in
mainland China, is a secular and practical culture that "simply
cannot remain antagonistic toward the West for long."</P>
      <P>The mainland Chinese are more fortunate than others if they want
to join the new world order, in that they have "living proof in
Taiwan and Hong Kong that Chinese culture is adaptable to full
democracy and the rule of law," the overseas democracy leaders said.</P>
      <P>Mainland China must come to grips with the fact that its real
challenge is internal rather than external. "NATO is simply not the
issue," they said.</P>

      <P>Hsu Wen-lung, founder and chairman of
Taiwan's ABS and acrylic giant Chi Mei Corp., on Wednesday donated to
Asian environmental protection efforts a prize of 3 million Japanese
yen he received from a Japanese media group.</P>
      <P>Hsu is one of the few regional leaders to be awarded with the
Asian Award sponsored by the Nihon Keizai Shimbun in recognition of
outstanding contributions to the people of Asia.</P>
      <P>Hsu received the award plus a cash prize of 3 million yen on
Wednesday, making him the first private entrepreneur from Asia to
receive the prestigious citation since its inception five years ago.
Previous recipients of the award have been statesmen or leaders in
fields other than industry and commerce.</P>
      <P>During the award presentation ceremony, Hsu was lauded by the
award panel as being not only a successful entrepreneur, but also an
art connoisseur and philanthropist.</P>
      <P>In a speech delivered in the Taiwanese dialect upon receiving the
award, Hsu said that what concerns him most as a businessman is when
society becomes complacent over industrial or business growth, and
disregards the harm done to the environment as a result of this
growth.</P>
      <P>Hsu said he would like to keep the citation, but give the cash
prize to environmental protection efforts, in the hope that his
"trivial contribution" will help conserve the environment across
Asia.</P>
      <P>Chi Mei Corp. is one of the top 50 enterprises in Taiwan, with
corporate assets totaling NT$12 billion (US$366 million).</P>
      <P>An avid art collector and connoisseur, Hsu established the Chi

      <P>Afterward, there would be four kings who would rule the country,
with the first ruling from jail. Sukarno, the founder of modern
Indonesia, was jailed before he became Indonesia's leader.</P>
      <P>The next king, according to the prophecy, would be a person with
extraordinary wealth and charisma that inspired obedience. This,
according to the report, is a reference to Suharto, who resigned last
year after more than 30 years in power.</P>
      <P>The third king would have a short and violent reign, Jayabaya
predicted, and this could be taken as a reference to current
President B.J. Habibie.</P>
      <P>Finally, the fourth king would be little-known figure who would
unexpectedly unite the country and usher in a golden age.</P>
      <P>Many of Jayabaya's adherents see the fourth king as Megawati, who
while hardly being "little known" was not seen as a possible leader
until Suharto made her a martyr in 1996 by expelling her from one of
his two officially sanctioned opposition parties.</P>
      <P>In other news about Indonesia, The Australian reported recently
that opinion polls show that among the country's 4 million
Indonesian-Chinese, 56.7 percent support Megawati as the country's
next president.</P>
      <P>One of the polls by Sinergi Magazine -- a new publication for the
Chinese community -- said that what is important is the new
willingness of the Chinese to get involved in politics.</P>
      <P>"That's a very significant phenomenon; that differs with the last
five or six elections," said Sinergi's commercial director, Martinin
Wiranata.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHINESE DISSIDENT CALLS FOR INTERNATIONAL PRESSURE ON BEIJING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  June  1  (CNA)
(By Jay Chen and Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Wei Jingsheng, mainland China's top
dissident, on Tuesday urged the international community to continue
its pressure on Beijing over human rights.</P>
      <P>Wei made his appeal at a seminar in Washington, D.C. in
commemoration of the 10th anniversary of the June 4, 1989 massacre by
the Beijing authorities of pro-democracy protesters in Tiananmen
Square.</P>
      <P>Even in a democracy, Wei said, politicians will change the course
of national policy only in the face of domestic or foreign pressure.
The difference between a totalitarian and a democratic country is
that the politicians of the former are unlikely to respond to
pressure from their own people, making pressure from the
international community especially important, such as is the case in
mainland China, Wei added.</P>
      <P>The noted dissident said he does not agree with the view that
Beijing is willing to resolve issues concerning human rights, nuclear
arms proliferation and environmental protection.</P>
      <P>The Beijing authorities may or may not be willing to resolve
these problems, Wei said, but the fact that they are a communist
regime makes them unable in essence to deal with the situation in an
internationally acceptable manner, he added.</P>
      <P>In view of the wave of nationalistic fervor instigated by the
Beijing authorities in the wake of NATO's accidental bombing of the
mainland Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, the mainland's
human rights record has become even worse than it was 10 years ago,
noted Wei.</P>
      <P>He explained that this move by Beijing meant that not only are
the mainland's pro-democracy dissidents facing a stronger crackdown
than before, even foreign businessmen in mainland China have been
experiencing hardship at the hands of the authorities.</P>
      <P>Wei went on to say that pressure from the international community
will affect mainland China's future development, and the effect of
the pressure will depend on its scale, noting that Beijing's
intransigence is inversely proportional to pressure from outside.</P>
      <P>Wei pointed out that without international pressure, Beijing will
commit to reforms only in the face of heavy domestic economic
pressure.</P>
      <P>The seminar titled "The 10th Anniversary of Tiananmen: The US,
China, and Human Rights" was held at the Brookings Institute, one of
the most highly respected independent research organizations in the
United States.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  2  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Chiang Kai-shek (CKS) International
Airport Police Bureau announced on Wednesday the seizure of 60 heroin
bricks hidden in three machinery molds imported from Thailand.</P>
      <P>The bureau said the high-grade heroin, weighing more than 21
kilograms and worth an estimated NT$1 billion (US$30.49 million) in
market value, is the largest narcotics seizure in Taiwan's civil
aviation history.</P>
      <P>Two suspects involved in the drug trafficking, identified as Liu
Li-tseng and Fang Ping-nan, were caught red-handed as Liu was handing
the contraband consignment to Fang.</P>
      <P>The duo told police that they were only responsible for
transporting the shipment, and did not know the products were
contraband narcotics.</P>
      <P>Police said they have obtained information about the mastermind
behind the shipment. "We will launch a large-scale manhunt to bring
to justice the alleged mastermind and other accomplices who are still
at large," said a senior official at the CKS Airport Police Bureau.</P>
      <P>Acting on a tip-off, police had been closely monitoring the three
molds ever since they were brought to CKS Airport, Taiwan's main
gateway, on a May 27 flight from Bangkok.</P>
      <P>Liu claimed the cargo on May 31 and immediately sent them to an
address in a back ally in Jenwu in the southern Taiwan county of
Kaohsiung. Liu was about to pass the cargo on to Fang when police
officers arrested them.</P>
      <P>Initial investigations show that Liu, who has a long criminal
record, once worked at a blue-chip company in Luchu, Taoyuan County.
He used the company's name to import the three molds from Thailand,
but senior company executives were unaware of the import of the goods
until the police informed them of Liu's actions.</P>
      <P>The police said this is the first time they have uncovered
contraband narcotics hidden in machinery molds.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SOONG OUTLINES QUALIFICATIONS FOR FUTURE ROC LEADER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>San  Francisco,  June 1 (CNA)
(By Neil Lu and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan needs strong leadership, but
does not need a "strongman" as head of state, former Taiwan Governor
James Soong said at the University of California at Berkeley on
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Soong also outlined the qualifications for a future Taiwan
leader in his speech, titled "Public Service with TLC: A Vision for
Taiwan's Democracy in the 21st Century." TLC refers to tender, love
and care, is now a buzzword widely used in US society.</P>
      <P>Soong, who ended his stint as Taiwan's first and last popularly
elected governor late last year, is widely believed to break ranks
with Taiwan's ruling Kuomintang to run in the island's 2000
presidential election as an independent.</P>
      <P>Tuesday's speech at Berkeley marked the first time that Soong, a
Berkeley alumnus, has spelt out his political concepts to foreign
nationals. The speech drew the attendance of more than 100 Berkeley
faculty members and graduate students.</P>
      <P>In his speech, Soong said a future Taiwan leader must have a
loving heart, efficiency, capability, direction, eloquence,
sincerity, diligence, integrity and ability to resist pressure.</P>
      <P>Soong said the future Republic of China government must provide
a stable environment for sustained economic development. To reach
this goal, Soong said, the ROC govenrment must meet three
requirements in policy-making process -- the govenrment must have
the support of all people; the govenrment must be responsive to
popular demand; all government agencies must abide by law and keep
their operations transparent.</P>
      <P>"These three indispensable factors will constitute tough
challenges to Taiwan's future leader and its people," Soong said.</P>
      <P>During the question-and-answer session that followed the speech,
Soong was tight-lipped over the possibility of his running in next
year's presidential election. Soong also declined to answer the
question whether he has the qualities or qualifications to be
Taiwan's next president.</P>
      <P>Soong arrived in San Francisco on Monday for a brief visit.
Soong said he is scheduled to visit Japan next week to exchange
views with Japanese scholars and politicians on the new Japan-US
defense cooperation guidelines, the current situation in Northeast
Asia and other topics related to regional stability and prosperity.</P>
      <P>Before coming to San Francisco, Soong also made a high-profile
four-day visit to the Philippines in lat May, where he met with many

    <TEXT>
      <P>Beijing should forswear its repressive
mandate in mainland China or it will face a serious challenge to its
one-party rule, an ROC official in charge of mainland China affairs
said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Wu An-chia, vice chairman of the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs
Council, said the quest for freedom and democracy is already an
irreversible trend among the people of mainland China, and described
as "very normal" the fact that the families of the unarmed victims of
the June 4, 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre have asked the Beijing
authorities to vindicate the pro-democracy movement for which they
gave their lives.</P>
      <P>Wu said he is not optimistic that Beijing will heed the calls,
because such a move would mean that certain incumbent Beijing leaders
would have to step down to take the responsibility for the killings.</P>
      <P>Wu made the remarks while answering questions from reporters at a
seminar in Taipei on cross-Taiwan Strait agricultural development.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that mainland China's sweeping economic reforms of
recent years have led to greater demands for change in the political
system, Wu said he hopes that the Chinese communist regime will
handle the vindication request without resorting to repressive means.</P>
      <P>Democracy is an irresistible historical trend in the current
post-Cold War era, and mainland China cannot isolate itself from this
wave, he noted, adding that mainland China's democratization is also
the key to improved ties with Taiwan.</P>

      <P>Pierre said that AIDC will be in charge of detail design,
manufacturing, and integration of the planned airplane's rear-section
and tail wings. The Bombardier Group has also invited Japan's
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and other international aircraft
manufacturers to participate in the project.</P>
      <P>Pierre said the aircraft with a full capacity of eight persons
can cover 5,741 kilometers without refueling. The plane can fly from
one coast of the United States to the other within five hours.</P>
      <P>With its long-distance capability, Pierre predicted that by 2012

Foreign Affairs (MOFA) on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The officials said that Oviedo, who is currently in exile in

      <P>A recent report by Argentinean newspaper El Clarin said that

flight-guidance instrument error might have led to the crash of an
F16 jetfighter in Taitung County last January.</P>
      <P>Two pilots, 43-year-old Chang Chia-kun and 30-year-old Dai

mountain in Taimali on the afternoon of Jan. 25.</P>
      <P>After the accident, the air force general headquarters formed a
task force to investigate the cause of the crash. A press conference
was called on Wednesday to announce the results.</P>
      <P>The most probable cause of the crash is an error in the reading
of the flight deviation indicator, said an air force officer.</P>
      <P>He said that because most of the aircraft's equipment and
instruments had been destroyed in the crash, investigators were
unable to determine the exact cause of the crash.</P>
      <P>He noted that prior to the crash, the pilots could not see the
 ground as the jetfighter was in clouds. The officer speculated
that the pilots might have continued relying on their
flight instruments, not knowing their instruments were in error.</P>
      <P>A navigation error, the officer said, might have caused the
jetfighter to deviate from its regular decent route and crash into
the mountain.</P>
      <P>In the wake of the crash, the air force has taken steps to
prevent the reoccurrence of a similar accident, including a broad
review of all flight training involving the reading of instruments.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  2  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan is moving toward the third wave of
democratization, and everyone is entitled to a chance to fair
competition, former Taiwan Provincial Governor James Soong said in a
speech at the University of California at Berkeley on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Soong was speaking on "Public Service with TLC: A Vision for
Taiwan's Democracy in the 21st Century" as a distinguished visiting
scholar and alumnus of the school. TLC stands for tender, love and
care, a buzzword widely in US society.</P>
      <P>Part of Soong's 40-minute speech, in which he shared his views on
Taiwan's democratic development, reviewed its present plights and
looked ahead to its challenges, was made available through his office
in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Soong noted that Taiwan has undergone two waves of
democratization. The first was led by late President Chiang
Chin-kuo in 1980s, with a main focus of expanding the participation
of multi-level governments so that the central government's policy
reflects the state of Taiwan's situation.</P>
      <P>The second wave of democratization, led by President Lee
Teng-hui, featured institutionalization and identification, so that
"traditional gaps among ethnic groups and religions were gradually
bridged," and a consensus was formed to fight for the future of
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He noted that as the next millennium approaches, Taiwan must
upgrade and continue to improve its quality of democracy during a
third wave of democratization. During this stage, no one has the
right to enjoy prerogatives but all have a chance to engage in fair
competition.</P>
      <P>Soong then touched on three indispensable elements for government
policies. He said policies should be supported by the public, a
government should have kindred feelings towards its people, and that
the process of making decisions should be apparent.</P>
      <P>Soong also reaffirmed his idea of the three R's which he
broached during his stint as the first and last popularly elected
Taiwan provincial governor; a modern government should be responsible
to the people, responsive to its needs and be reasonable in policy
formation and resource distribution.</P>
      <P>He then presented a fourth "R" - that a modern government should
be representative, meaning that when it formulates and executes
policy, it should always take into account the people's will, and that
a policy should be just toward all persons.</P>
      <P>Soong also touched on cross-strait relations, saying that since
the missile crisis in 1996, Beijing and Taiwan have made little
headway in establishing a constructive dialogue.</P>
      <P>He said that Taiwan has no "expediency" in handling cross-strait
relations, and that the official "go slow, be patient" policy has led
to worry in the private sector that Taiwan is gradually losing its
competitive edge to the mainland.</P>
      <P>But he reaffirmed that from his grass-roots talks, he has learned
that no person living in Taiwan would like to live under a communist
rule, and that no one on the island wants war between the two sides
of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>He said that most people in Taiwan believe that the best defense
will be to deter the war so that the way of freedom and democratic
system on the island can be protected.</P>
      <P>He also urged the world community to note that the row across the
Taiwan Strait is not about "sovereignty," but about "human rights",
adding that the world should respect the rights of 22 million people
living in Taiwan to have a free life.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan is the 14th largest trade nation in the
world, Soong noted that Taiwan's voice and participation should not
be absent from international forums. He added that allowing Taiwan
to rejoin the world community achieves the double goals of free
trade and fair competition.</P>
      <P>On Tuesday evening, Soong met with figures from high-tech
industries in the Bay Area in a dinner Tuesday night. He met
with George Shultz, former US Secretary of State, Wednesday morning
at Stanford University.</P>
      <P>Soong and Shultz were old friends, and the meeting in San
Francisco was arranged about two weeks ago. The presidential hopeful
is scheduled to visit Japan next week and exchange views with
Japanese scholars and politicians on the new Japan-US defense
cooperation guidelines, the current situation in Northeast Asia and
other topics related to regional stability and prosperity.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BAUER CRITICIZES CLINTON'S CHINA POLICY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  June  2  (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>US Republican presidential nomination
candidate Gary Bauer said Wednesday that President Bill Clinton's
plan to formally ask for most-favored-nation (MFN, now normal trade
relations) trading status for Communist China on the 10th anniversary
of the Tiananmen Square massacre "illustrates the shallowness and
utter bankruptcy of the tin-ear foreign policy this administration
has towards China."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) noted that not only is
Clinton's timing bad, so too is his policy, saying the Clinton
administration's China policy, like that of the Bush administration,
"has not succeeded in making trade fairer, people freer, or the world
safer."</P>
      <P>The California congresswoman said that for the past ten years,
the Republican leadership has opposed the efforts of a bipartisan
coalition Congressmen who have opposed the Bush-Clinton China policy.
This year, with a highly charged partisan atmosphere, Republicans may
want to exploit politically the failures of the Clinton China policy,
while appeasing the business community by voting to give Beijing MFN
(or NTR).</P>
      <P>"The human rights situation in China and Tibet challenges the
conscience of our country, and we respond with business as usual,"
criticized Pelosi.</P>
      <P>Bauer, a conservative Republican, said it borders on
the unbelievable that "on the very day America should be condemning
the Communist Chinese government for its shameful, brutal killing of
hundreds of its own people -- cold-blooded murders for which that
government still refuses to take responsibility, President Clinton
offers not a policy of punishment but instead of a policy of reward."</P>
      <P>June 4 is an important day in the march for freedom, stressed
Bauer, adding that "we should honor those women and men who gave
their lives, some of them even walking up to tanks in a historic and
memorable show of courage in pursuit of freedom.....President Clinton
darkens their memory by rewarding their killers on the day of the
murders. The president should at least have the dignity to choose
another day."</P>
      <P>Bauer, who has called for a new China policy, opposes both MFN
and Beijing's entry into the World Trade Organization. He has
challenged some of his republican rivals to change their positions
favoring MFN and the PRC's entry into the WTO.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AMERICA NEEDS MISSILE DEFENSE POLICY: ANALYST</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  June  2  (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China's expanding nuclear
capabilities and its role in proliferating military technology
highlight the need for the United States to deploy a national missile
defense, and Congress now must make a policy declaration that brings
an effective national missile defense into reality, according to an
American defense policy analyst.</P>
      <P>James H. Anderson, of the Heritage Foundation's International
Studies Center, wrote Wednesday that despite the Cox report's
startling revelations of Beijing's efforts to obtain, through legal
and illegal means, a wide range of US military technology secrets and
clear evidence that a missile threat from the Third World is growing,
President Bill Clinton refuses to make a decision on the deployment
of a national missile defense until June 2000.</P>
      <P>The People's Republic of China's relentless efforts to acquire
sophisticated US nuclear weapons designs is part of a larger strategy
to promote its position as Asia's hegemonic power. And a key element
of this strategy is Beijing's determination to threaten other
countries with ballistic missiles, as the PRC did in 1996 during
Taiwan's first direct presidential elections, noted Anderson.</P>
      <P>Since then, the analyst said, the PRC has positioned more than
100 short-range missiles within striking range of Taiwan. "Unless the
United States and its Asian allies move quickly to deploy credible
missile defense systems, China will continue to flex its 'missile
muscle' to intimidate its neighbors," added Anderson.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that to counter the growing Chinese missile
threat, the United States should develop sea- and space-based
defenses that can identify, track and shoot down hostile missiles
shortly after liftoff and before they can release multiple warheads
or decoys.</P>
      <P>This "boost-phase" intercept capability will offset the PRC's
ability to threaten the United States and its allies with ballistic
missiles, and also will make Third World tyrants think twice before
attempting to attack the United States, said Anderson.</P>
      <P>However, Anderson added, it is not enough for Congress to profess
its commitment to deploy a national missile defense. It must provide
requisite funding, oversight and programmatic direction to make this
a reality. And it must not allow the defunct 1972 Anti-Ballistic
Missile Treaty to crimp the testing and development of technologies
that hold near- and long-term promise for defending the United States
against missile attack.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOFA CONCERNED ABOUT MAINLAND ENVOY'S VISIT TO COSTA RICA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 3 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said
on Thursday it is concerned about a recent visit to Costa Rica by
mainland Chinese Ambassador to the United Nations Qin Huasun.</P>
      <P>Chen Ming-cheng, deputy director of the MOFA's Information and
Cultural Affairs Department, said the ministry was informed of Qin's
travel plan before his departure from New York to Costa Rica.</P>
      <P>"ROC Ambassador to Costa Rica Mao Kao-wen had expressed our
stance on the issue to Costa Rican authorities," Chen said, adding
that Costa Rican President Miguel Angel Rodriguez, in response to
Taiwan's concern, had ordered all ministerial-level officials not to
meet Qin during his visit.</P>
      <P>According to press reports, Qin arrived in Costa Rica, which
maintains formal diplomatic ties with the Republic of China, on May
30 and ended his visit on June 2. During his stay, Qin reportedly
had met with Costa Rican Foreign Minister Roberto Rojas Lopez and a
senior adviser to the Costa Rican president.</P>
      <P>This was Qin's second visit to Costa Rica. He first visit the
Central American country in March 1997 in an attempt to lure Cost
Rica to switch its diplomatic allegiance from Taipei to Beijing. His
bid, however, failed.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, Qin's latest trip to Costa Rica had
attracted wide attention.</P>
      <P>Noting that Qin's latest trip was organized by a Costa Rican
think tank -- the International Law Research Institute, Chen said
President Rodriguez had told ROC Ambassador Mao that Qin applied for
an entry visa in the name of trade promotion. "Therefore, Qin's
visit was private in nature," Rodriguez was quoted as having
stressed.</P>
      <P>In addition to banning senior Costa Rican officials from meeting
Qin, Rodriguez also assured Mao that the longstanding ROC-Costa
Rican relationship will not be affected by Qin's visit.</P>
      <P>Over the past few years, mainland China has made strenuous
efforts to lobby Cost Rica for switching its diplomatic recognition.
Mainland China has even purchased a large quantity of bananas from
Cost Rica as a bait.</P>
      <P>Chen said the MOFA will continue keeping close watch on
developments after Qin's just-concluded visit to Costa Rica.</P>
      <P>In fact, Chen said, mainland China has spared no efforts to
squeeze the ROC's diplomatic frontiers. "We must work even harder to
counter Beijing's attempt to isolate our country from the
international community," he added.</P>

(By Ben Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>Today is Thursday, June 3, or the 20th day
of the fourth month of the Year of the Rabbit according to the lunar
calendar. Following is a list of important events that have occurred
on this date in the past:

1808: Jefferson Davis, the American soldier and president of the
Confederate states, is born. He was captured by Union soldiers in
1865 and imprisoned for two years, and although he was indicted for
treason in 1866, he was never prosecuted.

1839: China's Ching Commissioner Lin Tse-hsu orders the burning
of the more than 20,000 chests of opium handed in by foreign
merchants in Kwangtung, sparking the Opium War between China and the
British. Since 1930, June 3 has been observed in China as Opium
Suppression Movement Day.

1864: More than 6,000 Unionists in the American Civil War are
killed or wounded in less than an hour at Cold Harbor, near Richmond,
Virginia.

1899: Johann Strauss the Younger, Austrian conductor and composer
of waltzes, dies at the age of 74. He is sometimes called "the Waltz
King," and is best remembered for his numerous waltzes such as "The
Blue Danube."

1924: Austrian writer Franz Kafka dies in a sanitarium at
Kierling, near Vienna, at the age of only 40 after losing a
seven-year battle with tuberculosis. The writer, whose stories and
novels, including "The Trial" and "Metamorphosis," exerted a huge
influence on modern writers.

1925: American actor Tony Curtis is born as Bernard Schwartz. His
many films include "Some Like It Hot, "The Boston Strangler,"
"Spartacus," and "The Vikings."

1937: The Central Standing Committee of the ruling Kuomintang
approves the adoption of the KMT's party song as the national anthem
of the Republic of China. The words of the ROC national anthem were
first issued by Dr. Sun Yat-sen as his opening instruction to the
students of Whampoa Military Academy on June 16, 1924.

1937: The Duke of Windsor, formerly King Edward VIII of Great
Britain, marries his American bride, Wallis Warfield Simpson, in
Paris.

1942: The Battle of Midway, a turning point for the Allies in the
war in the Pacific, begins. The US Navy launches offensive against
the Japanese fleet, sinking four Japanese aircraft carriers and
battleships, as well as six transport ships.

1946: Chen Kung-po, former acting president of the Nanking
government, a puppet regime established in China by breakaway former
government official Wang Ching-wei on March 29, 1940, which was
reorganized by Japan on Nov. 19, 1940, is executed for being a
traitor to China.

1946: The first bikini goes on show in Paris.

1959: Singapore gains internal self-government under a new
constitution with Lee Kuan Yew, leader of the People's Action Party,
as prime minister.

1965: Astronaut Edward H. White becomes the first American
astronaut to take a walk in space when he steps outside his Gemini 4
spacecraft.

1984: The British government admits there is a higher than
average level of leukemia cases around the Sellafield nuclear power
station.

1989: ROC nationals Chen Chi-le and Wu Tun are sentenced to life
in prison by the Taiwan High Court for the murder of outspoken writer
Liu Yi-liang, also known as Chiang Nan, in the United States.

1987: The Central Standing Committee of the ruling Kuomintang
approves a revised draft of the ROC National Security Law.

1989: Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, spiritual leader and head of
state of Iran, dies at the age of 86. Arrested and exiled for his
opposition to Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi's regime, he returned to
Iran on the shah's downfall in 1979 and established a new
constitution giving himself supreme power.

Confucius' lesson of the day: "There are three kinds of errors to
which men are liable when in the presence of their superiors. First,
to speak out when one is not called upon to speak: that is called
being froward. Second, to keep silent when called upon to speak: that
is called being disingenuous. Third, to speak out without taking into
consideration the expression in the eyes of the person spoken to:
that is called blindness."</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>CETRA ENCOURAGES TAIWAN TO TAP CENTRAL AND EAST EUROPE MARKET</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Paris,  June 2 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwanese businessmen could use distribution
centers and warehouses located in west Europe as based to open
central and east European markets, said Kao Yi-hsin,
secretary-general of the China External Trade Development Council
(CETRA) on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Kao recently led a delegation of some 60 Taiwanese companies to
Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania and Macedonia
to express Taiwan's interest in expanding economic coorperation with
those countries and to promote Taiwan-made products.</P>
      <P>After the visit, Kao said the countries were receptive to the
idea of business cooperation.</P>
      <P>According to Kao, Taiwanese businessmen can make use of the
distribution system used in the Netherlands to approach the targeted
European markets.</P>
      <P>Because Macedonia's economic activities have become almost
paralyzed due to the bombing in Yugoslavia, Kao suggested Taiwan
provide Macedonia with management skill to improve business
operations so that the country can struggle through its present
difficulties.</P>
      <P>Taiwan could help Macedonia to revive its industries of scale by
attracting foreign capital and offering job opportunities. In the
meantime, Taiwan can tap into Macedonian textile, foodstuff and
plastic product industries with local raw materials, Kao added.</P>
      <P>In order to facilitate the new trade and investment opportunities
in central and east Europe, Kao will urge Taiwan banks to provide
local businessmen with sufficient capital.</P>
      <P>In line with the Ministry of Economic Affairs' plan of promoting
external trade, CETRA will sponsor a trade fair in Taiwan for
countries in central and east Europe in the near future.

    <HEADLINE>HUMAN RIGHTS IN MAINLAND CHINA SAID LITTLE CHANGED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  June 3 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>On the eve of the 10th anniversary of the
Tiananmen Square Massacre, the president of Amnesty International in
Queensland said little progress has been made in mainland China in
regard to human rights, as trade, financial and commercial interests
have taken precedence.</P>
      <P>In a speech at Queensland University of Technology in Brisbane on
Wednesday, Ross Daniels said that in the current "economics first"
climate, it is not fashionable to remind governments of the horrors
of Tiananmen.</P>
      <P>"Despite this, human rights activists will continue their demands
on behalf of those who were killed, injured and imprisoned," he said
in an article published in The Australian Financial Review on
Thursday.</P>
      <P>"Governments, including the present Australian government, should
understand that justice for the victims of Tiananmen will remain
illusory while good governance principles of transparency and
accountability are sacrificed on the altar of short-term economic
expediency," he said.</P>
      <P>Despite its signing of the International Covenant on Economic,
Social and Cultural Rights in 1997 and of the International Covenant
on Civil and Political Rights in 1998, mainland China has continued
to violate the rights of free association, free speech and freedom of
assembly, Daniels said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a report Thursday in The Australian indicates mainland
China has moved to close Internet chat rooms, prohibit access to
Cable News Network satellite broadcasts and ban transmissions of
sensitive television footage in the run-up to Friday, the 10th
anniversary of the Tiananmen Square Massacre.</P>

    <DATELINE>San  Francisco,  June  2  (CNA)
(By Neil Lu and Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Taiwan Provincial Governor
James Soong on Wednesday revealed that he will fly to Japan from San
Francisco, as he prepares for his third visit to a foreign country in
a month.</P>
      <P>Besides his current US visit, Soong visited the Philippines late
last month.</P>
      <P>Soong called on former US Secretary of State George Shultz at
Stanford University's Hoover Institute Wednesday. During his visit to
the institute, the Taiwan political celebrity disclosed his plans to
visit Japan.</P>
      <P>Soong will discuss with Japanese politicians regional security
issues and the Japan-US security treaty, which affects Taiwan's
security and cross-strait relations, Soong said.</P>
      <P>In his meeting with Shultz, Soong was praised as a good man who
is endowed with a great deal of wisdom. Shultz, however, refused to
comment on Taiwan's 2000 presidential election or whether Soong is
qualified to run for the position.</P>
      <P>Shultz was in charge of US foreign policy during the Bush
administration, and he encouraged Taiwan and mainland China to
promote exchanges, and to deal with disputes through communication.
He has a reputation as an expert in the Asian-Pacific region and
cross-strait affairs.</P>
      <P>After the one-hour meeting, Shultz said he understands Soong's
opinions on Taiwan's political and economic development, as well as
on the island's relations with foreign countries.</P>
      <P>Soong, who ended his stint as Taiwan's first and last popularly
elected governor late last year, is the front-runner in next year's
presidential election, even though he has not yet announced his
candidacy.</P>
      <P>Soong arrived in San Francisco on Monday, where he gave a speech
on Taiwan's democracy a day later. He is scheduled to head for Japan
on Saturday.</P>
      <P>During Soong's May 21-24 Philippine visit, he met with incumbent
Philippine President Joseph Estrada and former Presidents Corazon
Aquino and Fidel Ramos.</P>

    <HEADLINE>1,400 ILLEGAL MAINLAND IMMIGRANTS LURKING IN TAIWAN: MINISTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 3 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An estimated 1,400 illegal mainland Chinese
immigrants are hiding themselves in Taiwan, posing a threat to
Taiwan's public order and national security, Interior Minister Huang
Chu-wen said on Thursday.</P>
      <P>The minister made the remarks at a meeting of the Legislative
Yuan's interior affairs committee.</P>
      <P>Huang said the undiscovered illegal mainland immigrants include
Chinese Communist Party and youth corps members as well as criminal
ring members.</P>
      <P>"The presence of these people is a threat to our national
security and public order," Huang noted.</P>
      <P>Quoting official tallies, Huang said 26 percent of uncovered
mainland stowaways were seized at airports, sea ports, coastal areas
or fishing boats off the Taiwan coasts. And the remaining 74 percent
were discovered at various places on the island.</P>
      <P>Huang said some of the uncovered mainland stowaways were Chinese
communists or youth corps members, while a few others were
underworld figures.</P>
      <P>"Some of those seized mainland gangsters had colluded with their
local counterparts in embarking on drug trafficking, firearm
smuggling, gambling, robbery, extortion and murder," Huang said,
adding that all those mainland suspects have been transferred to
law enforcement authorities for prosecution.</P>
      <P>Huang said the National Police Administration under the Ministry
of the Interior was authorized to investigate illegal mainland
immigrants and other related affairs in July 1991.</P>
      <P>In 1992, 3,709 mainland stowaways were seized and the number
reached a peak in 1993 when 5,643 mainland stowaways were uncovered.
By 1998, the number had declined to 1,126. In all, Huang said, 35,491
illegal mainland immigrants were seized or intercepted between 1992
and 1998.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, independent legislator Huang
Yi-chiao said he believes that the decline in the number of seized
mainland stowaways could be attributed to mainland China's fast
economic growth in recent years which he said has encouraged
mainland people to work in their own hometowns.</P>
      <P>Against this background, Huang said he thinks economic factors
are no longer a core reason behind the influx of illegal mainland
immigrants into Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"I'm convinced that nowadays the main purposes for mainland
people to smuggle themselves into Taiwan are intelligence
gathering or engaging in criminal activities," the lawmaker
said.</P>
      <P>In reply, Minister Huang said the ministry has intensified
investigations of illegal mainland immigrants and has carefully
analyzed backgrounds of all seized mainland immigrants to facilitate
probes.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the minister said he will study the feasibility of
imposing harsher punishment on local employers who hire illegal
mainland immigrants.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOEA SAYS MFN RENEWAL FOR MAINLAND CHINA WILL BENEFIT TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  3  (CNA)
(By David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>US President Bill Clinton's decision to
renew most favored nation (MFN) trading status for mainland China
will benefit Taiwan businessmen in mainland China and Taiwan's
re-exports to mainland China through Hong Kong, the Ministry of
Economic Affairs (MOEA) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Some congressmen have reportedly objected to the decision, but it
is expected that Congress will not be able to muster enough "no"
votes to override Clinton's decision.</P>
      <P>MOEA officials said NATO's accidental bombing of mainland China's
embassy in Belgrade and a recent US report on mainland Chinese
espionage in the United States have strained US-mainland Chinese
relations. This has resulted in a moratorium on bilateral talks on
mainland China's entry to the World Trade Organization (WTO). Faced
with these problems, Clinton should take a low-key approach to
promoting MFN renewal for mainland China, they said.</P>
      <P>The officials said Clinton's decision to extend mainland China's
MFN status will help mainland China's exports to grow, and that will
be good news for Taiwan businessmen on the mainland. Clinton's
decision will also benefit Taiwan goods re-exported to mainland China
through Hong Kong, they said.</P>
      <P>It has been estimated that 70 percent of Taiwan goods exported to
Hong Kong are re-exported to mainland China through Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>The US Congress must decide whether to approve Clinton's decision
within 30 days of its submission to Congress.</P>
      <P>According to US law, a two-thirds majority is needed to override
President Clinton's decision.</P>
      <P>Mainland China has enjoyed MFN status since 1980, the year after
it established diplomatic ties with the United States.</P>
      <P>Over the past 19 years, MFN status for mainland China has always
been renewed, even after the Tiananmen incident in 1989.</P>
      <P>Mainland China's status, however, is still subject to annual
review, though once the mainland enters the WTO, both countries will
automatically extend permanent MFN status to the other.</P>

      <P>Typhoon Lee, a researcher with Academia
Sinica, Taiwan's highest academic body, has been named a "foreign
honorary member" of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.</P>
      <P>Lee, a researcher jointly employed by Academia Sinica's Institute
of Earth Sciences and the Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics, is
the first local researcher to receive the honor.</P>
      <P>The 219-year-old American Academy said it has selected Lee as its
"foreign honorary member" because he is one of the discoverers who
proved that aluminum-26 was alive in the solar system 4.56 billion
years ago.</P>
      <P>The academy, founded by the second US president, John Adams, in
1780, also cited Lee's other research achievements, including
helping to create a theory for the formation of chondritic
meteorites; investigating the relationship of their oxygen,
magnesium, calcium, and lanthanum isotopic anomalties to Galactic
nucleosynthetic events; and using isotopic methods to deduce the
hisotry of Asian land masses and the past climate.</P>
      <P>Lee said titles or awards are not the ultimate goal of a
researcher. "The msot important thing for me is to explore the
secrets of the universe and natural phenomena," Lee said, adding that
the honor from the American Academy marks a recognition of Taiwan's
efforts in scientific research.</P>
      <P>Academia Sinica President Yuan T. Lee, a co-winner of the 1986
Nobel Prize in chemistry, said the American Academy's recognition of
Typhoon Lee's achievement also marks Taiwan's progress in
some scientific research fields.</P>
      <P>The Nobel laureate said some Academia Sinica academicians have
been named members of several prestigious foreign research
institutions. But all of them reside abroad. "Typhoon Lee is the

    <HEADLINE>THSRC HOPING FOR GOVERNMENT INVESTMENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  3 (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The head of the Ministry of Transportation
and Communications (MOTC) stressed on Thursday that every aspect of
the construction of a domestic high-speed railway should proceed
according to the railway's construction contract.</P>
      <P>MOTC Minister Lin Fong-cheng made the remark in response to
reports that the head of the Taiwan High-Speed Rail Corp. (THSRC)
wants the government to act as an investor to aid in the railway's
construction.</P>
      <P>The railway system's construction is being carried out under a
build-operate-transfer (BOT) formula -- a private consortium builds
and operates the system for a specified period of time, and after
that period control of the system is transferred to the government.</P>
      <P>THSRC Chair Nita Ing paid a visit to Premier Vincent Siew earlier
this year, and during that meeting she expressed her hope that the
government would invest in, as well as supervise, the THSRC.</P>
      <P>To date, however, the government has not directly replied to
Ing's request.</P>
      <P>Government investment is totally different from government
financing, according to the THSRC. And according to the Industrial
Upgrading Promotion Statute, government investments can amount to up
to 20 percent of the cost of a project, said the THSRC officials,
adding that they hope the government will become a partner of the
THSRC.</P>
      <P>Lin said he was not aware of the meeting between Ing and Siew. He
noted that the BOT formula has been adopted in the construction of
the high-speed railway. The contract signed last July between the
MOTC and the THSRC has complied with all the rules of the BOT
agreement. The contract indicates that the government does not need
to finance its construction, Lin said.</P>
      <P>As to the 28 project-related tasks that have to be completed by
the government by June 30, Lin promised to have them all completed
before the deadline.</P>
      <P>The government has completed 22 tasks, though the six most
difficult remain unfulfilled, according to Ing. The six unfulfilled
items include land acquisition and the tearing down of factories. The
railway project will be at a standstill until all tasks are
completed, said Ing earlier this week.</P>
      <P>Ing said she doubted that the government could complete the six
remaining tasks in one month.</P>
      <P>The high-speed railway project is valued at NT$400 billion. Ing
acknowledged that the THSRC has had fund-raising difficulties. Under
its current financing plan, the THSRC will reportedly ask for an
NT$280 billion loan from the government, and NT$120 billion in
syndicated loans from banks.</P>
      <P>Lin stressed that the MOTC will do its best to assist the THRSC
in getting the bank loans.</P>
      <P>The high-speed railway project is the first of its kind in
Taiwan. Ground was broken in late March, and it is scheduled to be
completed in 2003.</P>
      <P>Chung Hwa High-Speed Rail Consortium (CHHSRC) was edged out by
the THSRC in bidding for the contract last year. The most important
factor behind THSRC's winning the contract was that the THSRC did not
request government funding while the CHHSRC insisted on government
financing of up to NT$100 billion.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC CALLS FOR INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION IN FIGHTING NARCOTICS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  3  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A senior official with the Ministry of
Justice Investigation Bureau (MJIB) on Thursday called for closer
international cooperation in fighting contraband drugs.</P>
      <P>Chang Hsiang-shan, a division chief with the MJIB's
anti-narcotics center, made the appeal at a national anti-drug
meeting held in connection with the June 3 Opium Suppression Movement
Day, which has been observed since 1930 the Republic of China in
commemoration of the burning of imported opium in 1839 during the
Opium War against the British.</P>
      <P>Chang said the ROC has devoted much effort to curb drug
trafficking and abuse. However, the United States has continued
listing Taiwan as one of the world's 28 main drug transshipment
centers.</P>
      <P>Chang said the greatest obstacle to drug investigations is
changes in smuggling channels and modes. "With changes in social
environment and communications tools, drug dealers now have often
traveled abroad to negotiate trade deals, making it more difficult
to eradicate such illegal trade."</P>
      <P>Chang said cross-border drug trafficking has made it more
important to strengthen international cooperation in fighting such
operations.</P>
      <P>Chang said container shipment remains the most common way for
drug trafficking, and amphetamine and heroin form the bulk of seized
contraband drugs.</P>
      <P>According to MJIB tallies, mainland China is the top source of
amphetamine seized in Taiwan, with fishing boats as the main
smuggling tool. Meanwhile, Chiang Kai-shek International Port,
Taiwan's main gateway, accounts for the largest share of
heroin seized in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chang said all relevant government agencies should cooperate
even more closely to fight drug trafficking and abuse in order to
protect public health and national image.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  3 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's largest hog raiser, the state-run
Taiwan Sugar Corporation (Taisugar), is branching out overseas in
order to protect itself from the impact of Taiwan's market-opening to
foreign products.</P>
      <P>Because of this market opening, Taisugar has had to cut its
domestic hog-raising operation by one-third according to company
officials.</P>
      <P>The officials said on Thursday that the company plans to invest
NT$800 million (US$24.46 million) to establish a series of hog farms
in Canada, each of which will have a 130,000-head capacity.</P>
      <P>The three-stage investment is planned for a 2000 launch, which
will allow market sales by 2002, the officials said, pointing out
that the produce can be shipped to a number of markets including the
United States and Japan, or even back to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Taisugar pork is popular in Japan because of a "special
sweetness" the product is said to have. Although Japanese orders have
declined over the past few years due to a two-year export ban
following an epidemic of foot-and-mouth disease in Taiwan, Taisugar
executives said the company believes it can regain its market share
with its Canadian pork.</P>
      <P>In addition, Taisugar is also negotiating to invest in two hog
farms in Australia with a total capacity of 450,000 head.</P>
      <P>Last year, Taiwan opened its market to US-produced chicken, pork
and offal, as part of its bid for membership of the World Trade
Organization (WTO). However, the opening triggered a wave of demands
from other WTO members for equivalent treatment.</P>
      <P>During WTO multilateral working meetings which took place in
Geneva earlier this year, Taipei representatives promised a global
quota for imports of agricultural products, and that the quotas can
be raised gradually from as early as July 1.</P>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan tea, especially the Paochong and
Oolong varieties, have become popular in mainland China because of
their "special fragrance," the Taiwan Tea Manufacturers' Association
(TTMA) said on Thursday.</P>
      <P>TTMA Chairman Hsu Fa-cheng noted that although mainland China is
one of the world's major tea producers, while Taiwan produces less
than one percent of the world's tea, Taiwan tea has nevertheless made
inroads into the mainland market.</P>
      <P>Hsu made the remarks while announcing that a delegation
comprising around 70 Taiwan tea producers and representatives of
Taiwan's farmers associations will attend an international tea
exhibition which opens on June 18 in Beijing.</P>
      <P>He said that despite the fact that mainland China's Puer and
Dragon Well teas are world famous, and very popular in Taiwan, it is
the special fragrances of Taiwan's Oolong and Paochong teas which
have won the hearts of the mainland Chinese.</P>
      <P>Prize-winning tea from Taiwan has become a hot gift item among
Taiwan businessmen hoping to impress their mainland counterparts, so
much so that some reports claim that most of this championship tea is
purchased by Taiwan businessmen to be used as business deal
sweeteners.</P>
      <P>Hsu said that with mainland China's economic growth, consumer
spending power has substantially increased, and many tea shops in the
mainland are eager to stock Taiwan tea. At the same time, Taiwan
businessmen who open tea houses in the mainland also prefer to
feature tea from the island.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan government bans the import of tea from the mainland,
but it is still easily obtained due to the frequency with which it is
smuggled into the country.</P>
      <P>Hsu said that the government should accept this fact, and open
Taiwan's markets to legally imported mainland tea, as he said this
would deter smuggling and provide revenue from import tariffs.</P>

      <P>Wu Li-fen, executive director of the Humanistic Education
Foundation, pointed out that previous sexual education offered only
an adult's point of view toward the world of children, which meant
teenagers were in the dark as to how their sexual development ought
to occur.</P>
      <P>She said these incidents should teach adults a lesson, namely
that adults need further sexual education as well.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SEMINAR HIGHLIGHTS PLIGHT OF TAIWAN'S GROWING NUMBER OF SINGLE MOMS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 3 (CNA)
(By Wendy Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The number of single mothers is on the rise
in Taiwan, and the government should pay more attention to this
issue, said a sociology professor at National Taiwan University
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Professor Wang Li-jung, who is also a member of the Women's
Rights Promotion Committee (WRPC) under the Executive Yuan, spoke at
the "Women's Policy Blueprint Over the Millennium" seminar joinly
sponsored by the WRPC and the Women's Rights Promotion Foundation.</P>
      <P>Wang pointed out that the number of instances of divorce,
separation, abandonment, spousal loss and illegitimate children have
risen due to social changes. The number of single mothers has risen
particularly sharply.</P>
      <P>In 1996 single mothers accounted for some 60 percent of Taiwan's
390,300 one-parent families, about 6.7 percent of the total number of
families in Taiwan, according to official statistics.</P>
      <P>Wang said women have traditionally received less respect in
Taiwan society, which adds to their burdens as single mothers. Their
main problems are economic, and these problems have a negative
influence on the upbringing of children.</P>
      <P>Single mothers face more psychological pressure as well, having
to cope with family pressures, social stigmas and gossip, all of
which add to their emotional burden, Wang said.</P>
      <P>In addition, Wang said, present custody laws and visitation
rights tend to favor fathers.</P>
      <P>Wang suggested the government provide more help to single parents
through social welfare systems, the aim of which would be to
establish the well-rounded social welfare facilities needed by single
mothers.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING TRYING TO POSTPONE TOP ENVOY'S TAIWAN TRIP: EXPERTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  3  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Beijing is seeking to postpone a planned
trip to Taiwan by its top envoy with the island as a way of pushing
Taiwan to the negotiation table for political talks, experts
attending a seminar said on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Beijing will use the "technical" approach to postpone the visit
by Wang Daohan, chairman of the Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Strait (ARATS), from the slated autumn date to a date at the
end of the year, according to the academics and professors.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the symposium sponsored by the Foundation for
National Development Research to mark the 10th anniversary of the
June 4 Tiananmen Square massacre, Pan Hsi-tang, a mainland China
affairs professor at Tamkang University, said Beijing will
undoubtedly allow Wang to visit Taiwan this year, as it is one of the
major events in the mainland's dealings with Taiwan on its 1999-2000
agenda.</P>
      <P>Referring to comments by mainland China-based think tanks, Pan
said Beijing will use "technical" means to delay Wang's trip to
Taiwan to November or December in a bid to force Taiwan to accept its
terms that Wang will only discuss political issues with Koo Chen-fu,
his Taiwan counterpart and chairman of the Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF), during his Taiwan trip.</P>
      <P>As an example of these "technical" moves, Pan cited Beijing's
postponement of trips to the mainland by SEF Secretary-General Shi
Hwei-yow and his deputy Jan Jih-horng until late June. Jan was
originally supposed to head for the mainland earlier than Shi for
talks to pave the way for Wang's Taiwan visit.</P>
      <P>While repeatedly declaring that Wang's visit to Taiwan will be
more than just a sightseeing tour, and that he cannot return to the
mainland empty-handed, Beijing has been airing its view to the
international community that cross-Taiwan Strait political talks will
focus on three issues -- the end of hostilities under the framework
of "one China," the establishment of direct trade, postal, and
shipping links, and Taiwan's international presence, according to
Pan.</P>
      <P>Aware of Beijing's tactics, Taipei has insisted that the topics
of the upcoming Koo-Wang talks will not be limited to just political
issues, Pan added.</P>
      <P>As to the question of whether cross-strait relations have been
affected by the deteriorating Washington-Beijing ties following
NATO's bombing of Beijing's embassy in Belgrade, the mainland affairs
expert said that the setback in US-mainland links is temporary, and
that the two sides will continue with their engagement after
resolving their current disputes.</P>
      <P>Y.K. Ko, a professor from National Taiwan University, said Taiwan
should continue its dealings with mainland China in order to help the
mainland undergo peaceful transformation into a democracy, while
seeking to join the Theater Missile Defense (TMD) shield proposed by
the US for its allies in East Asia.</P>
      <P>However, Ko warned that while joining the TMD would certainly
provide Taiwan with greater security, it would also block the
development of cross-strait ties, and he suggested that the
government should play the TMD proposal close to its chest.</P>
      <P>He predicted that there will be no substantial breakthrough in
Taipei-Beijing links before the island's presidential elections
slated for March 2000, but echoed Pan's view that Wang will
definitely visit Taiwan as it is already set in Beijing's agenda.</P>
      <P>The future of cross-strait relations will mainly depend on the
policy of Taiwan's next president, Ko added.</P>
      <P>Y.S. Liao, a member of the National Security Council, called on
the government to be on high alert in its dealings with mainland
China at present, because of what he called the many "unseen
obstacles" in Beijing-Washington ties.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lin Cho-shui, a lawmaker of the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party, said that cross-strait relations will not undergo
any major changes, as basic differences between the two sides have
yet to be resolved. Future bilateral exchanges will be more
ceremonial rather than substantive, he added.</P>
      <P>After years of carrot-or-stick dealings with Taiwan, the Beijing
regime has now realized that it must adopt a firm but non-violent
approach to its dealings with Taiwan, since it is impossible for
Beijing to achieve its goals regarding Taiwan overnight, he asserted.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EPA MAY GIVE FPG 60 MORE DAYS TO DISPOSE OF TOXIC WASTE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 3 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Environmental Protection Administration
(EPA) is considering granting a 60-day extension for Formosa Plastics
Group (FPG) to handle a shipment of toxic waste temporarily stored in
an offshore warehouse at Kaohsiung Harbor in southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>EPA received a letter from FPG last week in which it asked that
it be given a 90-day grace period to help facilitate the handling of
the mercury-laced waste. It also expressed the hope that the waste
could be allowed into Taiwan for handling, but this request was
rejected.</P>
      <P>FPG officials said that they have applied for permission to ship
the waste to the United States, but information from the
Environmental Protection Agency there shows that three environmental
groups have expressed concern about the possibility of the waste
being allowed into the United States.</P>
      <P>The officials noted that it usually takes a month for a US agency
to process an application for entry in cases such as this, and added
that while the application process has yet to come to a conclusion,
if it is approved, the waste will be allowed into the country in
stages.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's EPA allowed the waste to be stored at Kaohsiung Harbor
for 45 days after it was shipped back from its original disposal site
in Cambodia in early April. The temporary storage period will expire
on June 6, and if the FPG has not made arrangements by then, it will
be punished according to the law.</P>
      <P>But the EPA officials said that in view of FPG's efforts to
comply with the transshipment, the EPA is considering granting a
60-day grace period, but will also ask the group to complete plans to
transship the waste to an alternative location within the 60 days in
case the United States does not approve the application. If FPG fails
to do so, it will face daily fines for each day the waste remains at
Kaohsiung Harbor.</P>
      <P>The controversial waste was first shipped from an FPG plant in
southern Taiwan late last year to the southern coastal town of
Sihanoukville in Cambodia, where it was improperly stored, causing
panic and chaos among the town's residents.</P>
      <P>FPG apologized to Cambodia for causing unrest among its
residents, and shipped the waste in 30 containers back to Taiwan in
early April.</P>

(By Y.C. Chiang and Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>South Korean President Kim Dae Jung on
Thursday expressed the hope that Asia can recreate its economic
miracle through regional economic cooperation.</P>
      <P>Kim made the remarks at a reception for ROC Economics Minister
Wang Chih-kang, mainland China's Assistant Minister of Foreign Trade
and Economic Cooperation Ma Xiuhong and eight other officials
attending an investment fair which took place in Seoul from June 1-5
under the sponsorship of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)
forum.</P>
      <P>During the 40-minute meeting, they discussed regional economic
cooperation under the APEC framework.</P>
      <P>Wang, the first ROC ministerial-level official to visit South
Korea since the two countries severed formal diplomatic relations in
August 1992, said he received a warm welcome from Kim.</P>
      <P>The South Korean president also said that as his country is
struggling to overcome its financial crisis, he has come to realize
the importance of free trade and foreign investment, but added that
South Korea has a traditional aversion toward the introduction of
foreign capital.</P>
      <P>However, Kim said he never misses an opportunity to advocate the
benefits of the introduction of foreign capital, including
transparency in business management, promotion of overseas markets,
and the subsequent increased job opportunities for local people.</P>
      <P>He stressed that one lesson South Korea has drawn from the
financial crisis which has swept through the region since mid-1997 is
that one country cannot insulate itself from crises in other
countries, and he urged Wang and his other guests to dedicate
themselves to regional economic cooperation in order to create a new

(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Although it failed in its bid to build the
island's first high-speed railway, the Chung Hwa High-Speed Rail
Consortium (CHHSRC) is willing to help its business rival to complete
the project, CHHSRC head Liu Tai-ying said on Thursday.</P>
      <P>In a five-point statement, the head of the Kuomintang-owned China
Development Industrial Bank (CDIB) which is the backbone of the
CHHSRC, said that contrary to reports that he had been told to block
the Taiwan High-Speed Rail Corp. (THSRC) from carrying out the
project, he was instructed by KMT leaders to help THSRC finish the
construction.</P>
      <P>However, Liu said he believed all along that the THSRC was too
optimistic in its estimation of the project's cost, which led it to
win the contract by offering to construct the railway at an
unrealistically low price.</P>
      <P>He said his bank would be more than willing to help THSRC out of
its fund-raising difficulties if the THSRC would allow CDIB staff to
examine the basis of its calculation of the cost.</P>
      <P>The CDIB has so far balked at investing money in the island's
largest-ever infrastructure project because of the THSRC's reluctance
to reveal its cost estimate, said Liu.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, he offered to lend THSRC the NT$280 billion
(US$8.75 billion) it needs to finish the project, providing the loan
is guaranteed by the government, and providing the CDIB is given the
exclusive right to raise any further funds for the project.</P>

THSRC's franchise to operate the railway after construction.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAINLAND SCHOLAR DOES NOT RECOMMEND QUICK REUNIFICATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  4  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Before mainland China really begins the
process of democratization, the reunification of Taiwan and the
mainland is not recommended, said Yen Jiaqi, a dissident Chinese
scholar and a visiting professor at Columbia University.</P>
      <P>Yen said a federation formula is more viable for Taiwan and
mainland China when they talk of possible unification.</P>
      <P>Yen and several other renowned mainland Chinese scholars are here
to take part in a June 4 roundtable meeting on mainland China's
democracy and on the country's reforms. The meeting will be held
Friday evening at the Grand Hotel.</P>
      <P>The meeting is being sponsored by the Central Broadcasting System
of the Republic of China in commemoration of the 10th anniversary of
the Tiananmen Square incident in 1989.</P>
      <P>Three other Chinese scholars are Yang Jianli, founder of the San
Francisco-based 21st Century China Foundation; Ruan Ming, a former
senior Chinese Communist Party public official; and Kuan Weiyen,
former director of the Institute of Physics under the prestigious
Chinese Academy of Sciences.</P>
      <P>Yen, who has shunned media contact in recent years, came to
Taipei at the invitation of Central Broadcasting "because he
accidentally heard of radio broadcasting from the Taipei-based
company right after he was wanted by the Chinese authorities in the
wake of the 1989 massacre." He then became an avid and regular
listener to its broadcasts.</P>
      <P>Formerly president of China's Political Restructuring Research
Society, Yen said he chose to come to Taipei to take part in
activities commemorating the June 4 incident because he considers
Taipei the greatest place where Chinese people are living. Taiwan's
democratization will have a profound influence on mainland China's
social and political evolution, he said.</P>
      <P>Yen, who in 1989 fled to France, where he lived for several years
before going to the United States, said that even New York and
London's Chinatowns cannot compete with Taipei's Chunghsiao East Road
in terms of economic development.</P>
      <P>Citing Taiwan and Hong Kong as the only hope of bringing about
mainland China's democratization, Yen said Taiwan today is mainland
China tomorrow.</P>
      <P>Citing President Lee Teng-hui's recent proposal of dividing China
into seven regions, Yen said the idea is impressive. Actually, China
can be divided into eight or nine regions to more rationally make the
nation a federation of separate states, he said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Yang, who obtained Ph.D. from both Harvard University
and the University of California, Berkeley, said the "seven-region"
proposal provides a window for all Chinese people to think about
China's future. He recommended the federation concept, saying that a
Chinese federation looks like a group of separated states, but
actually they are united as one country.</P>
      <P>Yang also said he does not think the time is ripe for Taiwan and
mainland China to reunify, since it will take a very long time for
mainland China to evolve into a democracy with the rule of order.</P>
      <P>Kuan, who renounced his Chinese Communist Party membership during
the democracy movement in 1989 and is now a visiting professor at
National Tsinghua University in Hsinchu, said rehabilitating
disgraced or imprisoned student activists and other democracy
campaigners in the 1989 democracy movement is the most important
thing that the mainland Chinese authorities should do now.</P>
      <P>A renowned superconductivity expert, Kuan was the first mainland
Chinese scholar to be invited by an educational institute in Taiwan
to teach here after 1989. He was president of Hefei University of
Science and Technology in Anhui before leaving the mainland.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Central Broadcasting is also conducting call-out and
call-in programs to allow a number of the Tiananmen Square student
leaders who are now residing overseas to take part in the roundtable
meeting through long-distance calls, further increasing the
discussion's significance.</P>
      <P>The former student leaders who will be joining the discussion
Friday will include Feng Cungdeh from France, and Li Lu, Wang Dan,
and Sheng Tung from the United States.</P>
      <P>The roundtable meeting will be simultaneously broadcast at home
and abroad, covering areas throughout mainland China and North
America. The program will also be transmitted through the Internet
radio, allowing on-line viewers to see the discussion, according to
Central Broadcasting officials.</P>

    <DATELINE>Washington, June 3 (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>US President Bill Clinton urged Congress
Thursday to support his decision to renew Normal Trade Relations
(NTR) status for mainland China, claiming that maintaining NTR with
Beijing will promote America's economic and security interests.</P>
      <P>Clinton said in a statement that NTR with mainland China is good
for Americans, because US exports to mainland China have quadrupled
over the past decade and support some 400,000 American jobs. Revoking
NTR would derail ongoing negotiations to increase US access to the
mainland Chinese market and to promote economic reforms there, he
added.</P>
      <P>The president noted that trade also remains a force for social
change in mainland China, "spreading the tools, contacts and ideas
that promote freedom."</P>
      <P>"We continue to speak and work strongly for human rights in
China. A continued policy of principled, purposeful engagement
reinforces these efforts to move China toward greater openness and
broader freedom. This is the path to lasting stability and prosperity
for China, to a future that will benefit the Chinese people -- and
the American people," explained Clinton.</P>
      <P>"We pursue engagement with our eyes wide open, without illusions.
We continue to speak frankly about our differences and to firmly
protect our national interests. A policy of disengagement and
confrontation would only strengthen those in China who oppose greater
openness and freedom," he said.</P>
      <P>Therefore, Clinton said, he is committed to bringing mainland
China into global structures and to promote Beijing's adherence to
global norms on human rights; weapons of mass destruction; crime and
drugs; immigration; the environment; and trade. And he is determined
to pursue an agreement for mainland China to join the World Trade
Organization (WTO) on viable commercial terms.</P>
      <P>"This is not a favor to China but a means of opening and
reforming China's markets and holding China to the rules of the
global trading system -- developments that will benefit America.
Accordingly, I am prepared to work closely with Congress to secure
permanent NTR status for China in the context of a commercially
strong WTO agreement," he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAC MARKS JUNE 4 TRAGEDY, URGES BEIJING TO BOOST DEMOCRATIC REFORMS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  4 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC), which charts Taiwan's policy toward mainland China, on Friday
urged the Beijing leadership to accelerate democratic reforms for the
well-being of all mainland people.</P>
      <P>The council made the appeal in connection with the commemoration
of the 10th anniversary of the bloody end of the 1989 student-led
pro-democracy demonstrations on the Tiananmen Square in Beijing.</P>
      <P>"We mourn all those who died 10 years ago for pursuing freedom
and democracy on the mainland," said MAC Vice Chairman Sheu Ke-sheng
at a news conference.</P>
      <P>Hundreds or possibly thousands of pro-democracy demonstrators
were killed when mainland Chinese troops and tanks shot their way
into the Tiananmen Square on June3-4, 1989.</P>
      <P>Sheu criticized Beijing authorities for brutally crushing the
student-led pro-democracy movement, saying the military crackdown
contradicted the implication of communist China's national title
"the People's Republic of China (PRC)."</P>
      <P>Noting that democracy was the goal of the Chinese communists
when they established the PRC 50 years ago, Sheu said it is regretful
that the Beijing leadership now thinks democracy would disrupt
mainland China's stability.</P>
      <P>Sheu said the Republic of China on Taiwan has consistently
believed that only when mainland China launches sweeping reforms and
establishes a democratic political system can it enjoy long-term
social and political stability.</P>
      <P>Sheu pointed out that democracy is a universal value and common
goal of all mankind. Although mainland China has continually promoted
economic reforms over the past decade, it has been reluctant to carry
out necessary political reforms and has even harshly suppressed calls
for democracy.</P>
      <P>"As a result, improvement in material life in mainland China in
recent years has not offered increased political participation for
mainland people," Sheu said, adding that such unbalanced
development has made mainland China's future prospects full of
uncertainties.</P>
      <P>Sheu reiterated that mainland China's democratization is
crucial to the development of relations across the Taiwan Strait.
"We believe that only when democracy prevails in mainland China, the
Beijing government will not become a negative factor affecting peace
and stability in the Taiwan Strait and prosperity in the entire
Asia-Pacific region," Sheu explained, adding that cross-strait
relations cannot see a major breakthrough until that day.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CANADIAN DAILY ON MAINLAND CHINA'S 'MEMORY HOLE'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  June  3  (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland Chinese attempts to use George
Orwell's "Newspeak" technique in rewriting Tiananmen history may not
succeed, thanks to another modern technology called the Internet, a
Canadian newspaper commented Thursday.</P>
      <P>The Ottawa Citizen warned Beijing that in the age of the
Internet, things thrown down the "memory hole," to use Orwell's
phrase, have a disconcerting habit of bouncing back.</P>
      <P>The influential newspaper carried an editorial, plus long feature
stories, columns and letters to the editor, to mark the 10th
anniversary of the Tiananmen Square Massacre, memories of which
mainland China's aging oligarchs have spent the past decade trying to
suppress.</P>
      <P>Many mainland Chinese seem prepared to accept the government's
view that it was fighting a "counter-revolutionary rebellion," the
editorial said. Many others, it added, seem prepared to forget it
entirely, which is the government's long-term goal.</P>
      <P>But "reality control," to use another Orwellian term, is a
difficult business, and it is doubtful mainland China's rulers will
be able to make their version of reality stick permanently, the
Citizen pointed out.</P>
      <P>It said the lengths to which Beijing has gone to suppress the
truth is "not only a tacit admission of culpability but also a
betrayal of their uneasiness about the future."</P>
      <P>"The Communist regime knows it is reaching the end of its
tether," it noted. /</P>
      <P>For now, the mainland Chinese government's legitimacy is bound up
with continued prosperity, which requires changes in the political
and legal system that would weaken the regime's control, the daily
observed.</P>
      <P>The quandary in which mainland China's leadership finds itself is
that without contact with the West, prosperity -- and therefore
political survival -- will be threatened. But with contact with the
West comes freer information, including e-mail and the Internet, the
daily said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>COLUMNIST DECRIES TIANANMEN AND THE WEST'S RESPONSE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  June  3  (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The 1989 Tiananmen Square carnage was an
atrocity, an obscenity, by any standard, and the fact the regime that
ordered the massacre is "still in power, still enjoys our diplomatic
respect and the investments of almost all our leading companies" is
itself, proportionately, atrocious and obscene, said a Canadian
columnist.</P>
      <P>David Warren made the remarks in "Ten years after Tiananmen
Square," which appeared Thursday in The Ottawa Citizen.</P>
      <P>He stressed that the mainland Chinese politburo under Deng
Xiaoping "were not psychopaths" who may not be held fully responsible
for their behavior. They made a cool calculation of the likely
consequences before ordering the butchery, he wrote.</P>
      <P>"They would have to accept the temporary outrage of the rest of
the world -- that was not a problem. They would have to endure
certain short-term trade sanctions. ... But so what? Compared to the
risk of losing power?" he wrote.</P>
      <P>Their calculation worked, Warren said. The pro-democracy protests
were snuffed in a single day; the subsequent arrests and clampdown
only increased the regime's commodity in trade with the West.
"Whenever a trade or other concession is wanted from the West, they
just dig out" one of the leading dissidents and put him on a plane
for the United States, he noted.</P>
      <P>No one pays attention to them once they are out of mainland
China. As Wang Dan, once mainland China's "most wanted man," said
last week in Toronto, "No one wants to listen to me here," Warren
wrote.</P>
      <P>Like the Soviets before them, mainland China's leadership has
found the West to be consistently "open for business," he observed.
So they have bought their way back to political equality with the
West, he added.</P>

percent tariffs on Australian exports, including lamb, seafood,
cheese and horticultural products.</P>
      <P>The Australian Financial Review reported the threat made by

list of nearly 25 product lines -- worth more than US$40 million in
Australian exports to Canada -- which may be included in a World
Trade Organization-authorized retaliation package if Australia fails
to lift the ban by July 6.</P>
      <P>"To date, Australia has shown no sign of lifting the (salmon

interests and why we are consulting with the public on building a
list of imported products that could be taxed," the daily quoted

    <TEXT>
      <P>The fifth Taiwan-Poland Economic Cooperation
Conference is scheduled to be held in Taipei on June 14 with
government officials and business leaders from both countries taking
part.</P>
      <P>The conference will be jointly presided over by Lin Chen-kuo,
chairman of the Taipei-based China External Trade Development Council
(CETRA), and Adrz Arendarski, president of the Polish Chamber of
Commerce (PCC), said officials from the Euro-Asia Trade Organization
(EATO), which is sponsoring the event.</P>
      <P>P.K. Chiang, chairman of the Cabinet-level Council for Economic
Planning and Development, and Adam Pawlowicz, director of the Foreign
Investment Bureau of Poland, will also attend the conference.</P>
      <P>EATO and the PCC decided to hold this year's meeting on June 14
to coincide with Eurogate '99, an Eastern and Central European trade
exposition in Taipei jointly sponsored by CETRA and the ROC
ministries of foreign affairs and economic affairs, slated to kick
off on June 15, said EATO officials.</P>
      <P>Delegates from Hungary and the Czech Republic who will be in
Taipei to attend Eurogate '99 will also be invited to the
Taiwan-Poland Economic Cooperation Conference, so as to allow Taiwan
businesses greater opportunity to gain an understanding of trade
prospects and the economic climate in Eastern and Central Europe, the
officials added.</P>
      <P>Top of the conference agenda will be discussions on a Taiwan
industrial processing zone to be developed in Poland by the
Taipei-based Acelon Chemicals and Fiber Corp.</P>
      <P>Acelon will finance the development of the zone, which is a
133-hectare tract located in a now defunct state-run textile plant
compound some 100 kilometers from the Polish capital of Warsaw.</P>
      <P>EATO and PCC began to take turns hosting the Taiwan-Poland
Economic Cooperation Conference in 1994 after the Polish market
became increasingly opened by the wave of democracy which swept
Eastern Europe in 1989.</P>
      <P>In addition to organizing large-scale Taiwan trade missions to
Poland over the last three years, CETRA, Taiwan's top foreign trade
arm, also chose Warsaw last year as the location of Taiwan's first
trade center in Eastern Europe.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KAOHSIUNG MAYOR ENVISIONS PRATAS AS `MALDIVES OF THE EAST'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  4  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Kaohsiung City Mayor Frank Hsieh said on
Thursday that he plans to develop the Tungsha, or Pratas Island group
lying 444 kilometers southwest of Taiwan's southern port of
Kaohsiung, into "the Maldives of the East."</P>
      <P>Hsieh made the remarks during an appearance before a committee of
the Legislative Yuan. The committee had invited officials of the
Ministry of the Interior to report on issues concerning the
development of the Pratas Islands, and Hsieh was also invited to give
his views.</P>
      <P>Vice Interior Minister Yang Pao-fa pointed out that the
government pays close attention to the Pratas, and noted that
military personnel are stationed there.</P>
      <P>Yang also said the ministry has agreed to let Kaohsiung city
government name the streets on the island, register the people who
relocate there, and study the possibility of developing the
islands into a tourist destination.</P>
      <P>Responding to legislators' questions on recent remarks by Liu
Tai-ying, chairman of the KMT Business Management Committee, on the
development of the Pratas, Yang denied that the ministry has
discussed the development with Liu, and stressed that if Liu is
indeed interested, he must proceed through the proper channels.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said that the city will basically adopt the BOT
(build-operate-transfer) model to develop the Pratas, meaning that
Kaohsiung will invite private businesses to develop the island group
under its guidance, and that those businesses will then operate the
project for a certain period before transferring the operation to the
city government.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, Kaohsiung city government will help the private
sector to acquire land and meet the requirements of environmental
assessments, as well as coordinate with the navy on the security
aspects of the project.</P>
      <P>He also said that he is planning transportation links between the
Pratas and two famous scenic spots -- Little Ryukyus and Kenting --
to form a "beautiful blue highway in the sea."</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung will work with international development firms to
develop the Pratas into what Hsieh described as "the Maldives of the
East." The city government will also follow the example set by
Australia with the Great Barrier Reef, and turn the Pratas into a
wildlife preservation area as well as a resort for local and
international tourists, Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said that to preserve the natural resources of the Pratas,
he will adopt a "low development" principle, keeping man-made
facilities to a minimum.</P>

to Venezuela, where assembly lines will be built. Some of the
products assembled there would remain in the country, while others
would be shipped to markets in North America.</P>
      <P>They would then try to encourage the companies that produce the
components they use to shift their production base to labor-intensive
Venezuela.</P>
      <P>Ultimately they intend to mull over the feasibility of inviting
technology-intensive companies to set up factories there.</P>
      <P>Officials of the two companies said they would phase in their
plan, which aims to help Taiwanese companies open up new markets, as
well as strengthen their competitiveness through joint efforts.</P>
      <P>Under the North American Free Trade Agreement, all goods
circulated in the Americas and the Caribbean will be free of tariffs
and quotas by the year 2005. This is seen as a further incentive for
the establishment of the assembly lines in Venezuela.</P>
      <P>This is also said to be why Premier Siew and P.K. Chiang,
chairman of the Council for Economic Planning and Development, have
been actively promoting investment opportunities there.</P>

beware of strife. In old age, when the physical powers are in decay,

      <P>The Tiananmen uprising will continue to
haunt the Chinese Communist Party leaders as long as there is no
genuine desire to learn its lessons, and in the end, the communist
leadership will become Beijing's own worst enemy, a Thai English
daily predicted on Friday.</P>
      <P>On the 10th anniversary of the June 4 Tiananmen Square massacre
in Beijing, The Nation carried an editorial titled "China Cannot
Erase 1989 Beijing Spring."</P>
      <P>"China's status in the world, not the chauvinistic version of the
Middle Kingdom, will not be judged by the height of its skyscrapers
and the number of department stores it has, but rather by how its
citizens are being treated and respected," the editorial said.</P>
      <P>Indicating that economic reform in mainland China has moved
forward rapidly, The Nation reminded its readers that political
reforms remain at a snail's pace.</P>
      <P>The paper urged Beijing to allow the parents and relatives of
those killed in the June 4 massacre to go into the streets to express
their tragic losses.</P>

(By Belle Chou and Amanda Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China's leading dissident Wang
Dan was refused a seat on a Taiwan-based airline's flight to Macau,
preventing him from attending a memorial activity on the 10th
anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre, sources said on Friday.</P>
      <P>Wang had already been refused a visa by the Hong Kong authorities
to enter for a similar activity in the former British colony.</P>
      <P>The only excuse EVA Air's Macau branch could offer was that they
canceled Wang's booking "because he did not reconfirm his reservation
14 days ahead of his trip."</P>
      <P>However, Wang Ming, chief editor of the magazine "China Spring,"
and the sponsor of Macau's Tiananmen Square memorial, said he was
booked on the same flight, and had no problem with his seat, leading
him to the conclusion that EVA had succumbed to pressure from the
Beijing leaders regarding Wang Dan.</P>
      <P>Since Wang was unable to enter Hong Kong, he had no choice but to
fly with EVA, which offers the only direct flight from the United
States to Macau without transiting through Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>EVA Airways belongs to Taiwan's Evergreen Group, and the group
has lucrative transportation businesses in mainland China's port

    <HEADLINE>`PACKET MODE' INTERNET USERS TO REACH 3 MILLION BY END OF 2000: NII</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  4  (CNA)
(By Wendy Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The National Information Infrastructure
(NII) special committee under the Executive Yuan announced on Friday
a goal of having a "packet mode" on-line population of 3 million by
the end of 2000.</P>
      <P>The "packet mode" of Internet access allows users to log on
directly after turning on the computer, bypassing the traditional
dial-up method, thus drastically reducing Internet fees and improving
overall Internet quality.</P>
      <P>The convener of the 28th special committee, Minister without
Portfolio Yang Shih-chien, said at a press conference after the
meeting that the NII originally planned to reach its goal by the end
of September.</P>
      <P>Yang said Taiwan's on-line population using traditional dial-up
mode will have exceeded 5 million by the end of next year.</P>
      <P>The NII decided to promote the new "packet mode" in the hope that
it will reach 3 million by the end of 2000, representing 60 percent
of Taiwan's Internet users with access to on-line quality surpassing
most of the rest of the world.</P>
      <P>Telecommunication construction will be carried out by Chunghwa
Telecom, and upon completion will guarantee each PC's on-line speed
to reach 64K or 128K, instead of the present dial-up speed of 56K,
Yang said.</P>
      <P>However, he went on, the biggest advantage of "packet mode" is
that it can drastically reduce Internet users' fees.</P>
      <P>According to Yang, dial-up users incur average monthly fees of
NT$3,000, but logging on through "packet mode" can reduce monthly
fees to NT$1,000 or lower.</P>

    <HEADLINE>THSRC MUST CONDUCT RISK ASSESSMENT BEFORE LOANS FORTHCOMING: MOF</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 4 (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Finance Paul Chiu said on Friday
that his ministry is willing to assist the Taiwan High-Speed Rail
Corp. (THSRC) to obtain syndicated loans to build the island's first
high-speed rail system.</P>
      <P>However, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) must first get access to
the THSRC's financial records and its risk assessment report, he
added.</P>
      <P>Chiu made the remarks in response to reports that the THSRC has
encountered snags in getting syndicated loans from banks to fund the
railway's construction, Taiwan's biggest-ever infrastructure project.</P>
      <P>Chiu also declined to comment on a proposal by Liu Tai-ying,
chairman of the China Development Industrial Bank (CDIB), that the
government can invest NT$100 billion in the THSRC in the form of
ordinary stocks and special shares, saying only that the proposal
should be weighed by the Ministry of Transportation and
Communications.</P>
      <P>Premier Vincent Siew said last year that as part of plans to
stimulate domestic demand, the MOF would assist the THSRC with
syndicated loans if it became necessary.</P>
      <P>As it now indeed appears necessary, much public attention is
being paid as to whether the MOF will live up to Siew's promise.</P>
      <P>THSRC Chairwoman Nita Ing noted that her biggest worry is that
the THSRC will not get the syndicated loans in time, and that the
project will fail.</P>
      <P>Liu's written statement released on Thursday said that if the
THSRC's financing projections are correct, the CDIB will be more than
willing to invest in the project, and will lead other banks in
providing loans.</P>
      <P>Ing noted that as Liu's statement is a suggestion to the
government, she is in no position to respond, but she remarked that
the THSRC totally accepts the rules of the government. She also
pointed out that while the THSRC project is already on track, Liu's
proposal represents another track altogether.</P>
      <P>Construction of the railway system is being carried out under a
build-operate-transfer (BOT) formula, whereby a private consortium
builds and operates the system for a specified period of time, after
which control is transferred to the government.</P>
      <P>The majority of previous BOT projects worldwide have failed, but
Ing said she intends to make the Taiwan high-speed railway project a
success.</P>
      <P>However, as it the first of its kind in Taiwan, the THSRC's BOT
project has no precedent to follow in terms of how to best carry out
the task.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's EVA Airways denied on Friday that
they prevented mainland Chinese dissident Wang Dan from taking an EVA
flight from San Francisco to Macau, saying that in fact he never
showed up at the airport.</P>
      <P>Wang's reservation on the flight to Macau, where he was to attend
a memorial on the 10th anniversary of the June 4, 1989 Tiananmen
Square massacre, had earlier been reportedly canceled by EVA Airways
without explanation.</P>
      <P>However, Evergreen Group, which owns the airline, said on Friday
afternoon that the reports were erroneous.</P>
      <P>A statement from the group said that Wang booked a seat in San
Francisco on May 15, and that the airline issued his ticket on May
25. As long as Wang's travel documents were complete, there would
have been no reason for EVA to prevent Wang from boarding the plane.</P>
      <P>According to Wang's reservation data, he was supposed to take
EVA's 1:30 a.m. (0830 GMT) flight on June 4 from San Francisco to
Taipei, which is scheduled to arrive at Chang Kai-shek International

    <TEXT>
      <P>Formosa Plastics Group (FPG) has been
urged to ship a consignment of mercury-laced industrial waste out of
Kaohsiung Harbor, as the deadline of a two-month temporary storage
period approaches.</P>
      <P>The Kaohsiung Harbor authority said on Friday it has sent formal
notification to FPG demanding that it transport the more than 4,000
metric tons of toxic waste out of the harbor before the June 8
deadline.</P>
      <P>Commenting on recent foreign wire service reports that a request
by FPG to ship the waste to the port of Xiamen in mainland China's
Fujian province has been turned down, the Kaohsiung Harbor authority
said it knew nothing about any such request, and had not received any
application from FPG to ship the waste out of its jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>The harbor authority stressed that it has demanded that FPG ship
the more-than 300 containers of waste out of the port as required by
the regulations.</P>
      <P>The Taipei-based petrochemical giant was given permission on
April 9 to temporarily store the industrial waste in Kaohsiung Harbor
for two months on condition it is transshipped elsewhere at the end
of the period.</P>
      <P>FPG originally tried to dispose of the shipment in a southern
coastal town in Cambodia, but were forced to remove it again after
local residents discovered the toxic nature of the waste. Since then,
the company has been desperately trying to find a suitable dumping
ground, to little avail.</P>

in authority, and condemns the words of wisdom of holy men."</TEXT>

Philippines and the United States.</P>
      <P>On Taiwan's political development, Soong reiterated his
supra-party and supra-ethnic stance, and said he believes that
Taiwan's political figures should have regional and global vision,
should promote the interests of Taiwan and speak out on the country's
behalf.</P>
      <P>They should also make the international community realize that
Taiwan is an important member of that community, that it has valuable
contributions to make, and that it is well able to shoulder its
international responsibilities.</P>
      <P>The presidential hopeful said that in addition to its own
interests, Taiwan should stress its positive significance to Asia and
the Pacific and the world community. If Taiwan can play a
constructive role, it will be a great help to the situation in East
Asia, he said.</P>
      <P>Soong said that political leaders in Taiwan should help the
international community to learn the value of Taiwan's democracy, and
should for their parts learn about the world's views about Taiwan so
that a positive interchange can be established.</P>
      <P>Soong, who has just completed a grueling round of engagements, is
expected to leave here for Taiwan on Saturday, where he rest for a few
days before traveling to Japan.</P>
      <P>Soong would not divulge his schedule in Japan, and declined to
respond to reports that he might meet incumbent ministers, former
prime ministers, and the executives of major political parties in
Japan.</P>
      <P>In the past month alone, he has visited the Philippines and the
United States, and although he has yet to formally announce his bid
to run in Taiwan's 2000 presidential election, he is obviously trying
to raise his international stature.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOE URGED TO STREAMLINE MANAGEMENT OF OVERSEAS SCHOOLS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  5 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A ruling Kuomintang legislator on Saturday
urged the Ministry of Education (MOE) to streamline the management
and supervision of Republic of China-funded schools abroad.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lee Ching-an made the call at a news conference held
at the Legislative Yuan, after alleging that Chao Yen-wei, president
of the Taipei School in Ho Chi Minh City, southern Vietnam, had an
affair with Shao Mei-ling, a former teacher at the school.</P>
      <P>Shao's former husband Chen Wen-su, who was also present at the
news conference, accused Shao of having Chao's baby while they were
still married.</P>
      <P>Lee said the adultery charge signifies management problems in
overseas schools. The journalist-turned-lawmaker demanded that the
MOE launch an immediate probe into the allegation.</P>
      <P>The lawmaker said she basically supports the opening of
Chinese-language schools in foreign cities which have populations of
ROC expatriates.</P>
      <P>Such schools can not only facilitate the younger generation's
study of Chinese language, but can also help narrow the academic gap
between overseas schoolchildren and their local counterparts, Lee
noted.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Lee said the MOE and Overseas Chinese Affairs
Commission should tighten the supervision and evaluation of the
schools to prevent scandals and other irregularities.</P>
      <P>"The MOE should send officials to all ROC-funded overseas schools
to evaluate their teaching qualities and interview their students,"
Lee said, adding that in recruiting teachers, the MOE should place
more emphasis on integrity, character and moral stature.</P>
      <P>In response to Lee's demand, Kao Chung-yun, a senior MOE
official, said the ministry had already asked Chou Yen, chairman of
the Ho Chi Minh City Taipei School, to investigate the allegation
after it received Chen's petition earlier this year.</P>
      <P>Kao said that if Chao is found guilty of misconduct, the MOE will
ask the school's board of directors to punish him.</P>
      <P>The ROC has set up Chinese-language schools in Vietnam, Thailand,
Malaysia and Indonesia. The MOE sets aside a budget of NT$60 million
(US$1.83 million) annually to help finance the schools.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The opening of a privately funded
organization to boost Taiwan-Macau trade and tourism relations has
had to be delayed as a result of interference by Beijing,
organization officials said on Saturday.</P>
      <P>The officials of the Taiwan-Macau Tourism, Trade and Cultural
Promotion Association said they decided to postpone the opening
ceremony and that they will choose an "appropriate time" to announce
the new date, after failing to resolve a dispute between attending
dignitaries from Taiwan and mainland China.</P>
      <P>The opening ceremony was originally slated for Saturday morning,
and representatives of the two sides of the Taiwan Strait had been
invited to take part. However, the event was blocked by Xinhua News
Agency's Macau bureau chief, who protested that W. L. Lee,
representative of the Taipei Trade and Tourism Office in Macau,
was to have attended the ceremony under his official title.</P>
      <P>Xinhua New Agency, Beijing's official mouthpiece, is the de facto
representative office of mainland China in the Portuguese enclave on
mainland China's southern coast.</P>
      <P>The association is said to have its principal backing from an
influential "casino king" in Macau who is seeking to play a greater
role in bilateral Taiwan-Macau relations after the Portuguese enclave
returns to Beijing rule on Dec. 24 this year.</P>

      <P>More than 90 percent of Taiwan's residents
are satisfied with their relations with their spouses, parents and
children, according to the results of a survey released on Saturday
by the Ministry of the Interior (MOI).</P>
      <P>The survey, conducted by Fu Jen Catholic University, also found
that 79 percent of the respondents said the government should
maintain social order, while 44 percent suggested that it curb
corruption.</P>
      <P>MOI officials said 92.4 percent of the respondents are satisfied
with their spouses, and 91.3 percent are satisfied with their
parent-children relations. They are most concerned about the safety
and health of their family members.</P>

their old age, and that they support the government's measures to
step up social and medical welfare, especially for the elderly.</P>
      <P>Some 71.8 percent said they are satisfied with their home

    <HEADLINE>GROUP URGES MORE EMPHASIS ON ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 5 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>With its fast economic development, Taiwan's
living conditions are on a par with those of industrialized nations,
but damage to the environment has reached an unprecedented level, an
environmental group said on Saturday.</P>
      <P>Hsieh Chih-cheng, secretary-general of the Taiwan Environmental 
Protection Union, unveiled statistics showing how Taiwan's
environment has been affected between 1985 and 1997 by economic
development. He urged the public not to ignore the problem.</P>
      <P>One of the most significant features of Taiwan is its high
population density, Hsieh said. Although population growth dropped
from 12.91 percent in 1985 to 8.65 percent in 1998, the island's
population density is still too high, he said.</P>
      <P>He noted that the population density was 602 people per square
kilometer in 1997. In urban areas, the figure was much higher, as the
cities of Taipei and Kaohsiung had about 9,000 people per square
kilometer.</P>
      <P>There are also far more motor vehicles in Taiwan now than before.
Between 1985 and 1997, the number of motor vehicles grew by 93
percent, and as of 1997 there were 15.31 million, most of which were
motorcycles.</P>
      <P>But the number of roads in Taiwan increased by only 70 percent
during that same period, and now each 100 square meters of road must
support 4.56 vehicles.</P>
      <P>Another area of concern is garbage and industrial waste. Although
the government has built more incinerators to handle regular garbage,
the production of industrial wastes has increased each year. Proper
handling of industrial waste is not occurring often enough, he said,
adding that the likelihood of toxic waste being dumped is especially
worrisome.</P>
      <P>The union said that the soil, air and water in Taiwan have been
affected by unprecedented pollution.</P>
      <P>The union said that the energy and industrial structure of Taiwan
is also cause for concern, noting that some industries waste too much
energy and produce too much pollution, namely the petrochemical,
steel refinement and cement industries. Taiwan does not need these
types of energy-consuming industries, they said.</P>
      <P>As for the island's water quality, Hsieh said that the pollution
of rivers and drinking water has cast into doubt the government's
handling capacity. A particularly serious problem is the
eutrophication of Taiwan's reservoirs, the main source of Taiwan's
drinking water. The problem has reached a serious level, the union
said.</P>
      <P>Hsieh expressed his hope that the government and private sector
will pay attention to the environment so that there will be better
living conditions for the public.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,   June   5   (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Macedonian Prime Minister Ljubco
Georgievski, leading a 59-member delegation, is scheduled to arrive
in Taipei on Sunday for a six-day official visit.</P>
      <P>This will be Georgievski's first visit to the Republic of China
since the two countries forged formal diplomatic ties in January
this year.</P>
      <P>Georgievski originally planned to visit Taiwan in February or
March. But his travel plan was postponed several times because of the
Kosovo crisis, which triggered the influx into Macedonia of a large
number of ethnic Albanian refugees from the neighboring Yugoslav
province of Kosovo.</P>
      <P>With the outlook in the Balkans brightening following Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic's consent to accept an international
peace plan for Kosovo, Georgievski has finally managed to realize his
long-planned Taiwan visit.</P>
      <P>During his stay, Georgievski will meet with President Lee
Teng-hui, Vice President Lien Chan, Premier Vincent Siew and other
senior ROC officials to discuss concrete measures to boost bilateral
relations and cooperation.</P>
      <P>Georgievski will chair a seminar to introduce Macedonia's
general investment climate, related regulations and development
potential to attract Taiwan entrepreneurs to invest in his nation.</P>
      <P>To facilitate bilateral trade, investment and economic
cooperation, Georgievski will sign an investment guarantee
agreement, a tax exemption accord and a free trade agreement with
ROC Premier Vincent Siew.</P>
      <P>On June 9, Georgievski will preside over the inauguration of the
Macedonian Embassy in Taipei.</P>
      <P>The 33-year-old Macedonian prime minister is still on a visit to
the United States. He will travel directly from there to Taipei.</P>
      <P>Georgievski told a news conference in Washington, D.C. on
Friday that Macedonia's upcoming presidential election will affect
his country's relations with the ROC.</P>
      <P>Even though the incumbent Macedonian president once opposed the
establishment of diplomatic ties with the ROC, Georgievski said that
problem has been resolved.</P>
      <P>By now, Georgievski said he does not see any problems in
bilateral relations between Macedonia and the ROC.</P>
      <P>He went on to say he believes that ROC-Macedonian economic
cooperation will be further strengthened following his visit to
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Georgievski complained that major countries around the world
have been reluctant to honor their promises of giving financial aid
to Macedonia whose economy has been seriously affected by the Kosovo
crisis. "The large number of Kosovar refugees is a heavy financial
burden for us," he complained.</P>
      <P>The ROC has donated US$2 million in cash to Macedonia to help
the former Yugoslav state cope with the refugee problems. In
addition, the ROC donated many relief goods, including
pharmaceuticals, medical equipment, and daily necessities, to
Kosovar refugees in Macedonia. It also sent a medical team to
Macedonia to offer free medical services to Kosovar refugees.</P>
      <P>The ROC attaches great importance to its relations with
Macedonia because the Balkan state is one of its only two diplomatic
allies in Europe.</P>

      <P>A man sprayed a department store in downtown
Taichung City with gunfire Saturday, injuring a pregnant woman, police
said.</P>
      <P>The hit-and-run attack took place at noon at the Kung-San Sogo
Department Store.</P>
      <P>The unidentified woman, who was 20 weeks' pregnant, was shot in
the neck. She was rushed to a nearby hospital, where doctors
characterized her condition as serious and said they are concerned
she may lose her baby.</P>
      <P>The gunman and an accomplice arrived at the department store in a
car at noon, according to a witness. A man wearing a ski mask got out
of the car and fired randomly at the store's front windows with a
Uzi-style machine gun.</P>
      <P>After about 40 rounds were fired, the pair drove off. The car
they arrived in was found later on a nearby street, and the car's
owner said it had been hijacked by two gunmen earlier in the day.</P>
      <P>This is the second such attack on a department store in Taichung,
and the first to take place in the daytime.</P>
      <P>Taichung police have launched a large-scale search for the men,
but no arrests have been made so far.</P>
      <P>Police said the attack may have been intended as a warning, but
store officials said the store was not involved in any dispute that
could have resulted in the attack.</P>
      <P>The store attracted nationwide attention earlier this year after
its owners became embroiled in a high-profile financial scandal. A
trial resulting from the scandal is still pending in Taichung
District Court.</P>

Corp. (THSRC), the project's main contractor, has relied on a
too-optimistic and unsound financial assessment, which has inevitably
resulted in fund-raising problems.</P>
      <P>Liu proposed government investments totaling NT$100 billion in
the form of ordinary stocks and special shares, which the THSRC can
purchase back whenever it has enough funds.</P>
      <P>Liu, dubbed by outsiders as a "wicked mother-in-law" in the
project -- even though he is a man -- praised the head of the THSRC,
Nita Ing, as a "good daughter-in-law." He said Ing's father was one
of his intimate friends, and Ing is a dedicated worker, clever and
competent. But he said there is too much pressure in trying to
complete the island's most ambitious infrastructure project.</P>
      <P>The CDIB chairman stressed that he has never criticized the
financing plan of the THSRC as unfeasible. He said he just meant that
the group might encounter snags in getting syndicated loans from
banks to fund the railway's construction. The difficulties could come
from the fact that the THSRC has assets worth only NT$60 billion, but
its bid for the high-speed railway project is valued at NT$400
billion.</P>
      <P>Ing acknowledged that the THSRC has been plagued by fund-raising
difficulties since winning the bid for the contract last July.</P>
      <P>Under the current financing plan, the THSRC will reportedly ask
for an NT$280 billion loan from the government and NT$120 billion in
syndicated loans from banks.</P>
      <P>Construction of the railway system is being carried out under a
build-operate-transfer (BOT) formula, whereby a private consortium
builds and operates the system for a specified period of time, after
which control is transferred to the government. It is the first of
its kind in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Liu re-emphasized that the CDIB is sincerely willing to assist
the THSRC, adding that the CDIB would be willing to invest
substantially in the project if the THSRC developed a sound financing
plan.</P>
      <P>In regard to the system's design, Liu suggested that the THSRC
adopt a Japanese design instead of a European one. If the THSRC
cannot complete the project, Chung Hua High-Speed Railway Corp.,
which bid against TSHRC for the construction contract, might be given
a chance to take over the project.</P>
      <P>Although the group, which was chaired by Liu, disbanded after it
lost the contract to TSHRC, the consortium might be regrouped and
step in to complete the railway, provided it were able to construct a
Japanese-style system, Liu said. Otherwise, he added, it would be
impossible for the task to be continued.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PARTY UNITY IS THE PRIORITY: KMT VICE PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFUL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  5  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Unity within the ruling Kuomintang is the
party's main priority, said Wu Poh-hsing, the only known vice
presidential hopeful within the Kuomintang, on Saturday.</P>
      <P>Answering questions from reporters at the end of a seminar on
religion and national development, the current senior adviser to the
president said division within the KMT before the 2000 presidential
election could end the party's rule of the island.</P>
      <P>Although he has made no secret of his vice presidential
aspirations, Wu said party unity takes precedence over his personal
desires, and that he would put the party's solidarity before his
personal interests.</P>
      <P>Wu's statement was interpreted as a suggestion that he might
abandon his attempts to become the party's vice presidential candidate
if it were to boost the KMT's chances of winning the election.</P>
      <P>Although the KMT is almost certain of selecting current Vice
President Lien Chan as its candidate for president, there has been
talk of nominating party heavyweight and former Taiwan Provincial
Governor James Soong as the party's vice presidential candidate.</P>
      <P>Soong is believed to be thinking of a presidential run, even if
it means running as an independent.</P>
      <P>Although popular among the party's grassroots supporters, Soong
had a falling out with the party's leadership because of his
opposition to the KMT's plan to downsize the Taiwan Provincial
Government.</P>
      <P>Political analysts have suggested that the party recruit Soong as
Lien's running mate to avoid party division and to ensure a KMT
victory in next year's presidential election.</P>

    <HEADLINE>JAPANESE WOMAN PAYS TRIBUTE TO HER FATHER'S TAIWAN SAVIORS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ilan,   eastern   Taiwan,  June  5  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Japanese woman on
Saturday finally relaized her wish of paying tribute to a Taiwan
family which rescued her father from rough seas off northeastern
Taiwan coast 54 years ago.</P>
      <P>Kuniko Inatomi, 54, was moved into tears when she met Chang
A-shuang, the only surviving member of the family, in Wuchieh, a
coastal town in the northeastern county of Ilan.</P>
      <P>An emotional Inatomi grabbed Chang's hands tightly to express
her gratitude for the family's resuce of her father and four of his
colleagues aboard a Japanese military supply ship.</P>
      <P>Chang A-shuang is the wife of Chang Tsao-yang who, together with
his father Chang Wu and elder brother Chang Tsao-chih, rescued
Inatomi's father and four other Japanese men near the Wuchieh beach
in September 1945.</P>
      <P>The Changs carried home the five Japanese men on their back
after spotting them on the beach. The family provided the Japanese
men with foods and clothing, in addition to curing their wounds.</P>
      <P>After five to six days of attentive care from the Chang family,
the five Japanese men regained strength. The Chang family reported
the case to local authorities which then sent the Japanese back to
their country.</P>
      <P>Inatomi said her father was the captain of the Japanese
military supply ship which capsized in a storm on its way from
Taiwan's Keelung port to Japan's Ishigaki. All the 16 crew members
aboard the ill-fated ship fell into rough seas. Only five of the
crew, including Captain Inatomi, were rescued by the Chang family,
while the 11 others all disappeared.</P>
      <P>Inatomi said she was only nine months old when the incident took
place. "I heard of the episode from my parents when I was young,"
Inatomi said, adding that her parents had asked her to convey their
thanks to the Taiwan family on their behalf.</P>
      <P>Inatomi's father already died and her 92-year-old mother has
repeatedly reminded Inatomi to travel to Taiwan to find her father's
rescuers.</P>
      <P>With the assistance of the Suao Junior Chamber of Commerce and
several Japanese and Taiwan politicians, Inatomia finally managed to
locate the Chang family.</P>
      <P>Inatomi gave a gift to Chang A-shuang to express her gratitude.
She said from now on she will travel to Taiwan every year to
meet the Chang family and see for herself Taiwan's progress.</P>
      <P>On Saturday, Inatomi also held a memorial service at the Wuchieh
beach in memory of the 11 Japanese sailors who died in the
incident.</P>
      <P>According to Inatomi, only one of the five rescued Japanese crew
members is still alive. "Because of his poor health, he could not
travel with me to Taiwan," Inatomi said.

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN TO SHUN BELGIAN MEAT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 6 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan will shut the door to meat, poultry,
and other agricultural products from Belgium in the wake of a dioxin
contamination scandal in that European country.</P>
      <P>The Board of Foreign Trade under the Ministry of Economic Affairs
is expected to make a formal announcement on the ban on Monday,
sources from the Council of Agriculture (COA) said on Sunday.</P>
      <P>The ban will be imposed on frozen animal meat and poultry, eggs,
milk and dairy products imported from Belgium, COA officials said.</P>
      <P>Processed meat products from Belgium may also be included in the
ban, and if necessary, related products which are already on
supermarket shelves may be retrieved, COA officials noted.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, officials from the Bureau of Commodity Inspection and
Quarantine are looking into facts and reports to see whether meats
from European countries other than Belgium have also been
contaminated.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has never imported poultry, pork and beef products and
eggs from Belgium, although the island has purchased a considerable
quantity of milk and dairy products from Europe's "dairy kingdom."</P>
      <P>Taiwan imported 89,452 kilograms of cream butter, 370,000
kilograms of yogurt drinks, 107,400 kilograms of cheese, 133,600
kilograms of dried dairy fat, and an unknown amount of yolk from
Belgium in the first four months of this year, according to tallies
from the Board of Foreign Trade.</P>
      <P>Although the Belgian dioxin contamination scandal has so far
mainly affected poultry, pork and beef, COA officials noted that yolk
and cheese from Belgium have also reportedly been tainted with the
cancer-causing dioxin chemical.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is paying close attention to the dioxin contamination
scandal as it occurs at a time when Taipei is poised to increase the
importation of foreign agricultural products in its bid to join the
World Trade Organization, before the end of this year.</P>
      <P>The contamination, Europe's worst food scandal since Britain's
"mad cow" crisis, has led to stricter European Union restrictions on
Belgian poultry, pork, beef, and related products.</P>
      <P>The scare came to light last Friday after it was acknowledged
that some 1,000 Belgian farms have used feed from a contaminated
storage tank. How the chemical got into the tank remains unclear, and
the scale of the contamination is still being investigated.</P>
      <P>The United States, Singapore and Hong Kong have also banned the
importation of Belgian meat products.</P>

    <HEADLINE>JAPANESE WOMAN PAYS RESPECTS TO TAIWAN SAVIORS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ilan,  eastern  Taiwan,  June  6  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Japanese woman is here
fulfilling her parents' wishes to pay respect to an Ilan family for
saving her father's life some 54 years ago.</P>
      <P>Kuniko Inafuku, a 55-year-old duty-free shop owner in Ishigaki
Port near Okinawa, flew to the eastern coastal city of Ilan Saturday
to meet with Chang Ah-shuang, 73.</P>
      <P>Chang is the only "savior" still alive from a family who cared
for Inafuku's father and several other Japanese after they nearly
drowned in an ocean mishap in 1945.</P>
      <P>Inafuku's father, the captain of the "Masafuku-Maru", was on
board the Japanese transport ship on Sept. 1, 1945 with 15 military
and civilian passengers en route from the northern Taiwanese port of
Keelung to Ishigaki Port when a typhoon ravaged the ocean and
overturned the vessel.</P>
      <P>While most of the passengers were swallowed by the sea, Captain
Inafuku and four passengers of the "Masafuku-Maru" were swept by
strong winds and currents to near Ilan's Wuchieh Hsiang beach. The
five Japanese washed ashore on a salt land forest near Wuchieh's
Litze Village.</P>
      <P>The five were discovered lying on the beach by Chang Wu, a
Litze-based fisherman, and his two adult sons. The Changs then
carried the Japanese back to their home.</P>
      <P>Chang Ah-shuang, at the time was the 18 year-old daughter-in-law
of Chang Wu. She remembered that the Japanese were carried home one
at a time and that all of them were barely alive.</P>
      <P>Under her father-in-law's instructions, the Chang's made a hot
bath for the Japanese and prepared meals, although food was scarce.</P>
      <P>The five Japanese men rehabilitated in the Chang's narrow and
ragged home, sleeping on the living room floor for about one week.
Chang Wu then reported the incident to the relevant agencies and the
Japanese were returned to Japan.</P>
      <P>Kuniko Inafuku said her father died in Ishigaki two years later,
but it has been the long-cherished desire of her mother, now 92 years
old, to find the Taiwanese saviors and thank them for their kindness.
Kuniko said her mother always told her that it was father's wish that
a member of the Inafuku family visit Taiwan and express respect to
the Chang family.</P>
      <P>One of the rescued is still alive, said Kuniko. The 83-year-old
former soldier, however, could not make the trip due to poor health,
she added.</P>
      <P>Chang Ah-shuang is also the only surviving member of the Chang
family.</P>
      <P>On Saturday, Kuniko Inafuku, on behalf of her elder mother,
visited Chang Ah-shuang and visited the home where Captain Inafuku
and his four passengers rehabilitated 54 years ago.</P>
      <P>The "Masafuku-Maru" was one of the last Japanese ships to return
to Japan from Taiwan after Japan formally surrendered after World War
II.</P>

      <P>Republic of China (ROC) Foreign Minister
Jason Hu said on Sunday that it is undesirable for the country's
diplomacy to be affected by prospective presidential candidates.</P>
      <P>Hu made the remarks upon his return from a visit to Guatemala, El
Salvador and Saint Christopher and Nevis with Premier Vincent Siew.</P>
      <P>Hu came back to Taipei one day ahead of Siew to greet Macedonian
Prime Minister Ljubco Georgievski who arrived in Taiwan on Sunday for
a six-day visit at the invitation of the ROC government.</P>
      <P>The foreign minister's remarks were apparently referring to
former Taiwan Governor James Soong's recent trips to the Philippines
and the United States.</P>
      <P>During his trip to Manila, Soong held talks with the incumbent and
former Philippine presidents through private arrangements -- talks
which caused some controversy in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Hu told the media that he would not like to see domestic
"internal strife" stretch to the diplomatic front.</P>
      <P>He denied reports that the Foreign Ministry gave discriminative
treatment to Soong and another presidential candidate, former Taipei
Mayor Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>Hu said that Chen had asked the Foreign Ministry to provide
assistance before his recent trips to the US and Japan. Through
arrangements of the ROC representative offices, Chen had dined with
the ROC Representative to Washington Stephen Chen, and was able to
meet with Japanese political leaders.</P>
      <P>He went on to say that Soong did not inform the Foreign Ministry
prior to going to the Philippines and the United States.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, in responding to Hu's remarks that political leaders
should not harm the country's interests by making statements when
abroad, Soong told the media in San Francisco on Saturday that he
hopes Hu "will remember what he has said."</P>
      <P>Soong said that he believed his recent meetings with the
Philippine presidents were in the interest of the country.</P>
      <P>Soong added that in consideration of the country's interest, he
has turned down several foreign invitations.</P>
      <P>For instance, he said, Georgetown University, his alma mater, had
invited him to give a public speech, but he did not accept because
the university is located in the politically-sensitive Washington
area.</P>
      <P>He said that he had also turned down an invitation from former
US President Gerald Ford to take part in an international forum
in the US.</P>

      <P>Typhoon Maggie, a medium-strength typhoon,
is blowing across the southern part of Taiwan with heavy rain soaking
the mountainous areas in the south and east.</P>
      <P>According to a report released by Taiwan's Central Weather Bureau
Sunday morning, the cyclone was located near Kaohsiung, southern
Taiwan, and moving in west-northwest direction at 26 kms per hour.</P>
      <P>Maggie is passing through the southern Taiwan Strait, with rains

      <P>The weather bureau predicted Maggie will move out to sea by 7:00
a.m. Monday.</P>
      <P>CWB weathermen estimated that the typhoon would next land on
mainland China's Guangdong province. The CWB will not call off land
warnings until Sunday night, at the earliest, they said.</P>
      <P>The southern and eastern parts of Taiwan are being soaked by
Maggie's relentless rain. As of Sunday morning the two areas had
received 200 millimeters of rain.</P>
      <P>Forecasters warned people living in mountainous regions to take
precautions against flooding. They also warned that high seas may
inundate the southern coasts.</P>
      <P>Rainfall and winds grounded most domestic flights Sunday morning
, including all flights between Taiwan and the offshore islands of
Lanyu, Green Island and Penghu. The Fengnien airport of Taitung, as
well as the airports in Kaohsiung and Tainan, were also closed.</P>
      <P>It is expected that airports will remain closed until after
Maggie has moved away, according to officials at a typhoon
monitoring center in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Officials said that roads in Taitung and Hualien have been
severely damaged and there have been mudslides. The South Link

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN BOND MARKET TURNOVER EXPECTED TO EXCEED NT$60 TRILLION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 6 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Turnover on Taiwan's bond market is expected
to hit a new high this year, topping the NT$54.95 trillion
(US$1.68 trillion) registered last year, the Central Bank of China
(CBC) said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The island's bond market turnover in the first four months of
this year totaled NT$17.13 trillion, an increase of NT$2.50 trillion
over the same period last year, according to CBC statistics.</P>
      <P>Bond market turnover stood only at NT$21.25 billion in 1984. It
surpassed NT$100 billion to reach NT$141.62 billion in 1986, and
exceeded NT$1 trillion on its way to NT$1.59 trillion in 1990.</P>
      <P>The figure reached NT$10.73 trillion in 1992 and climbed to
NT$20.80 trillion in 1995.</P>
      <P>Encouraged by government efforts to expand the bond market,
turnover of the island's bond market reached NT$40.39 trillion in
1997. The figure jumped to NT$54.95 trillion in 1998, an historic new
high.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TWO-DAY WEEKENDS WILL LOWER ECONOMIC GROWTH BY 2 PERCENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  6  (CNA)
(By Wendy Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's economic growth will fall 2.07
percent if two-day weekends are implemented across the country next
year, according to the newest evaluation by the cabinet-level Council
for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD).</P>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan has decided that starting next year, the
two-day weekends, now occurring every other week, will be extended to
every week. The lost eight hours from the two Saturday workdays will
be replaced by additional half-hour work periods from Monday to
Thursday.</P>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan asked the CEPD to submit an evaluation report
on the socio-economical effects of two-day weekends in the year 2000.</P>
      <P>According to the evaluation, each additional day off will lower
the gross domestic product (GDP) by 0.084 percent, and add 0.36
percent to labor costs.</P>
      <P>If two-day weekends are implemented nation-wide next year,
workers will receive 24.7 more holidays compared to 1998, the GDP
will be lowered by 2.07 percent and labor costs will increase 8.89
percent, which are detrimental to Taiwan's economic growth and
national competitiveness.</P>
      <P>The report pointed out that the government's weekend system will
influence the private business sector. If the private sector does not
follow the government's lead, two-day weekends will have a smaller
impact on overall economic growth.</P>
      <P>However, the report noted, a discrepancy between government and
private workers' working days will increase tension and disputes
between employers and employees. The tensions will negatively impact
Taiwan's national competitiveness, employment opportunities and
economic growth.</P>
      <P>The report concluded that since national holiday adjustments have
not been clarified, rash decisions to implement five-day workweek
could leave Taiwan with more holidays than any other country in the
world.</P>
      <P>At the same time, while public servants' working days have
decreased, total working hours have not changed, which is detrimental
to government efficiency and public service.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAGGIE CAUSES US$31,000 WORTH OF AGRICULTURAL LOSSES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 6 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Typhoon Maggie's strong winds and torrential
rains caused about NT$10.17 million (US$31,000) worth of agricultural
damage to Taiwan as of Sunday morning, the Council of Agriculture
(COA) reported.</P>
      <P>The island received some NT$3.37 million worth of crop losses and
NT$6.8 million of damage to agricultural fields, the report said.</P>
      <P>Most of the losses occurred in Taitung and Hualien counties,
where the middle-sized typhoon struck the hardest, an agricultural
official said, noting that seven hectares of agricultural fields in
Hulien county have been flooded.</P>
      <P>However, the official said that Maggie had caused minor damage to
Taiwan compared with other typhoons. He said it was fortunate that
rice farmers around the island had already harvested their crops
prior to Maggie's approach.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, islandwide anti-typhoon centers reported no casualties
as of Sunday noon. However, 100,000 households in Pingtung's Hengchun
area, and 3,700 in Taitung suffered electric power blackouts, the
reports said.</P>
      <P>Maggie's strong winds damaged two major electric lines of the
Third Nuclear Power Plant in Hengchun, triggering the shutdown of two
generators, according to the Taiwan Power Company (Taipower).</P>
      <P>Taipower said the generators cannot be reset quickly, though,
their failure will not affect daily power supply. The damaged power
lines will be repaired as soon as the wind weakens, Taipower said.</P>
      <P>Maggie was the first typhoon affecting Taiwan this year.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Russia and mainland China plan to step up
their cooperation in the military and other fields, the national
radio station of Russia said in a recent Mandarin broadcast.</P>
      <P>In a commentary on Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov's visit
to Beijing on June 1-3, the broadcast said that the United States and
NATO have taken actions of military aggression against Iraq and
Yugoslavia, and that they may also make countries in the Asian
Pacific region victims of their aggression in the future.</P>
      <P>Ivanov's visit to Beijing attested that Russia and mainland China
need to enhance their cooperation in the military and other fields,
it added.</P>
      <P>The broadcast also said that Russian President Boris Yeltsin
will visit Beijing in late October or early November, and that he
and his mainland Chinese counterpart Jiang Zemin "will sign
important documents, including a joint statement on the world
situation" during the visit.</P>
      <P>It added that the two countries are "quite uneasy about the
general strategy of NATO and the United States," and that the joint
statement will enable the two countries to cooperate more closely
than before "in preventing this trend of threat from developing."</P>
      <P>The broadcast said however that Russia and mainland China do not
want to enter into a military alliance, because this will usher the
world into a new cold war. "But, to oppose hegemony is another
matter," it said, adding that the drive to oppose hegemony will be
more effective, if India and other Asian Pacific countries join in
the efforts.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MJIB UP-LINKS WITH 48 NATIONS IN ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING EFFORT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 7 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau
(MJIB) is now up-linked to an international anti-money laundering
network that covers the monetary trading activities of 48 countries.</P>
      <P>The Internet uplink gives a shot to the arm to the MJIB's efforts
to crack down on Taiwan-based companies that engage in insider
trading or illegal transactions of assets through their overseas
holding affiliates, MJIB officials said on Monday.</P>
      <P>The MJIB formally joined the Egmont Group, also known as the
International Money Laundering Prevention Center (IMLPC), last year
to strengthen Taiwan's efforts to prevent cross-border money
laundering.</P>
      <P>Through the assistance of the Egmont Group, the MJIB has recently
joined up with Egmont's anti-money laundering network, gaining access
to financial activities and related information from 48 IMLPC member
nations from Europe, North America, Latin America and the Caribbean.</P>
      <P>MJIB officials took part in an annual Egmont conference in Slovak
from May 26 to 28, during which member countries agreed to form a
network to allow quicker and more efficient crackdowns on money
laundering.</P>
      <P>It was also agreed in the conference that member countries will
exchange bank account records and related information to allow law
enforcement agencies to trace bank deposits suspected of being
illegal.</P>
      <P>A number of Taiwan firms have been found to have conducted
insider trading or illegal transactions of their assets through
overseas affiliate companies registered in Bermuda, the Virgin
Islands, Panama and other nations in the Caribbean or Latin America.</P>
      <P>Most of those countries are members of the Egmont Group, and
since the MJIB is included in the anti-money laundering network, it
will be easier for the bureau to look into instances of suspected
fraud or illegal financial transactions involving Taiwan companies,
MJIB officials said.</P>
      <P>The Egmont Group was formally established in Egmont-Arenberg
Palace in Brussels, Belgium, in 1995 with 28 founding members. Ten
economies, including Taiwan, formally joined the group in its 1998
conference.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is now the only Asian member of the group. Japan took part
in the 1999 conference in its capacity as an observer and is expected
to become a full member next year.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Money Laundering Prevention Center formally began
operations under the MJIB in April 1997, one year after the
Legislative Yuan passed a law to outlaw money laundering.</P>
      <P>The law obliges banks to report to law enforcement authorities
any transaction involving a sum of more than NT$1.5 million
(US$30,580).</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN FOREX RESERVES AT NEARLY FOUR-YEAR HIGH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 7 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves continued
to surge in May to US$95.7 billion, a nearly four-year high, the
Central Bank of China (CBC) reported on Monday.</P>
      <P>The May forex reserves were the highest since August 1995 when
the reserves amounted to US$98.96 billion.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's forex reserves passed the US$100 billion mark for the
first time in May 1995, when they reached US$100.32 billion. They
continued to swell to US$100.41 billion in the next month, which was
their highest level in the country's exchange reserve history,
officials from the CBC's Economic Research Department said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves have increased every month
since last June, and the total at the end of May was US$11.26 billion
higher than the year-earlier level.</P>
      <P>CBC officials attributed the remarkable growth mainly to the
appreciation of the Taiwan currency against the US dollar since late
1998. Greenbacks account for more than 50 percent of Taiwan's foreign
exchange reserves.</P>
      <P>Other factors contributing to the increased foreign exchange
reserves include a better export performance and greater inflows of
foreign capital, CBC officials said.</P>
      <P>The pace of the reserves' growth, however, slowed in May over
April, though officials attributed the decline to the depreciation of
the New Taiwan dollar, which was NT$0.04 lower in May than in April.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TYPHOON MAGGIE CAUSES US$18.17 MILLION IN AGRICULTURAL LOSSES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  7  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Typhoon Maggie caused NT$596 million
(US$18.17 million) in losses to agricultural production in one city
and five counties in Taiwan, according to the Department of
Agriculture and Forestry under the Taiwan Provincial Government.</P>
      <P>Department officials said agricultural losses were reported in
the city of Tainan and in Ilan, Pingtung, Taitung, Kaohsiung and
Hualien counties. Losses were heaviest in Pingtung County, which lost
NT$422.96 million (US$12.89 million).</P>
      <P>Officials said losses in Pingtung County were heavy enough that
it is eligible for relief loans and cash assistance.</P>
      <P>Crop losses are expected to exceed NT$554 million, while damage
to agricultural fields has been estimated at NT$6.8 million and
damage to fisheries and fishing equipment has been estimated at NT$30
million and NT$4.8 million, respectively.</P>
      <P>In all, 3,606 hectares of agricultural fields, including 1,800
hectares of submerged rice paddies, were affected by Maggie.</P>
      <P>Typhoon Maggie also caused substantial damage to mango, banana,
lichee and water melon farms, mainly in Pingtung County.</P>
      <P>Although land and sea warnings for Maggie are no longer in
effect, the Central Weather Bureau said more rainfall is expected
islandwide Monday. Residents in eastern, southern and southeastern
Taiwan are being warned about possible heavy rains and flooding.</P>
      <P>Bureau officials also said that Maggie has brought ample rainfall
to the island in the past few days. Tienhsiang in Hualien County
received the most at 425 millimeters, while Taitung County's Chihpen
received 375 millimeters, Kaohsiung received 283 millimeters and
Pingtung received 269 millimeters.</P>
      <P>State-owned Taiwan Power Co. said on Monday that Maggie has
caused power disruptions in 250,000 households in southeastern
Taiwan. As of Monday morning, only about 300 households in the
mountainous areas of Fengkang and Manchou in Pingtung County were
still without electricity after emergency repair work was done.</P>
      <P>Taipower said they expected power to be restored islandwide by
the end of the day.</P>
      <P>Two units of the third nuclear power plant in Hengchun, at the
southernmost tip of Taiwan, tripped after Maggie hit, though it has
not affected the power supply, the officials said.</P>
      <P>The Council of Agriculture (COA) said that major vegetable and
fruit production areas escaped the typhoon unscathed.</P>
      <P>COA officials said that the supply of vegetable and fruits
remains ample and that the public should not expect prices to rise,
as has happened after past typhoons.</P>
      <P>The officials said that the major agricultural areas in central
Taiwan, namely Changhua, Yunlin and Chiayi, have not been ravaged by
Maggie. Even if there are heavy rains in the next few days, supplies
will remain stable.</P>
      <P>They said that compared with past years, the prices of vegetables
and fruit are comparatively low, noting that the average wholesale
price of vegetables was NT$25 (US$0.76) per kilogram last year, but
only NT$17 (US$0.52) per kilogram this year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GOV'T TO HELP THSRC BUILD HIGH-SPEED RAILWAY: PREMIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  7  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Vincent Siew said on Monday the
government will assist Taiwan High-Speed Railway Corp. (THSRC) in
completing the island's first high-speed rail system as scheduled.</P>
      <P>Siew made the pledge at a news conference held shortly after his
return from a 10-day, three-nation Central American visit, which
took him to Guatemala, El Salvador and the Saint Christopher and
Nevis.</P>
      <P>The premier lauded the Ministry of Transportation and
Communications (MOTC) for its efforts to promote the high-speed
railway project in a responsible manner.</P>
      <P>Siew said the government, the private contractor and the bank
consortium should forge a partnership and cooperate closely to
overcome difficulties and ensure smooth proceeding of the
multibillion-dollar project.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the government is likely to lend the THSRC NT$100
billion (US$3.05 billion) to enable the company to carry out the
project in full swing as early as possible, Siew said the government
must make a thorough evaluation before a decision can be made.</P>
      <P>Noting that the high-speed railway is Taiwan's first BOT
(build-operate-transfer) project, Siew said the government must
consider whether its funding would affect the BOT spirit.</P>
      <P>"If the THSRC files a formal request, the government will
carefully screen the application and make a final decision," Siew
said.</P>
      <P>The THSRC, a private business and industry consortium, won the
contract to build the US$13 billion-worth high-speed railway under a
BOT formula last year. The company's difficulties in raising enough
funds, including a delay in reaching a loan agreement with a bank
consortium, have recently sparked speculation and doubt about the
firm's ability to complete the project as scheduled in June 2003.</P>
      <P>Siew said if necessary, the Cabinet-level Council for Economic
Planning and Development will pool wisdom and resources of all
relevant government agencies to help the THSRC fulfill the project.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Siew described his just-concluded Central American
visit as very fruitful and inspiring.</P>
      <P>The main purpose of Siew's visit was to attend the inauguration
of new Salvadoran President Francisco Flores. During his stay in El
Salvador, Siew said he managed to meet with top leaders from many
countries, including those with which the ROC does not maintain
formal diplomatic ties.</P>
      <P>"Many foreign politicians have expressed admiration for our
progress in economic and political reforms," Siew said, adding that
many foreign officials have also shown keen interest in developing
closer ties with the ROC.</P>
      <P>Siew said he has come to understand through the visit that
despite Beijing's constant attempts to isolate Taiwan from the
international community, the ROC will still be able to forge close
ties with other countries through its own efforts.</P>
      <P>"Diplomacy is critical to our country's future development. All
relevant government agencies must redouble efforts to help expand
our diplomatic frontiers," Siew said, adding that Taiwan can use its
economic clout to help foster friendship and substantive relations
with other countries.</P>
      <P>Commenting on a plan by five southern Taiwan cities and counties
controlled by the opposition Democratic Progressive Party to
jointly issue welfare lottery, Siew said he hopes the issue
will not be politicized.</P>
      <P>"The issue should be considered from technical and functional
perspectives. The central government has handled the issue in
accordance with the law. Earnings from the lottery will all be used
for social welfare projects," Siew said.</P>
      <P>Turning to relations with Macedonia, Siew said he will take
advantage of Macedonian Prime Minister Ljubco Georgievski's current
visit to discuss concrete measures to boost bilateral ties.</P>
      <P>Siew said the ROC will assist Macedonia in economic
rehabilitation and in resolving its unemployment problems.
Georgievski, heading a 59-member delegation, arrived in Taipei on
Sunday for a six-day official visit. If necessary, Siew said, he
will make a reciprocal visit to the Balkan state later this year.</P>

      <P>Australia has told Canada to back away

    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China is in the spotlight again,
as Australia is waging an uphill battle to stem a rising tide of
illegal immigrants, while its detention centers are already fully
packed.</P>
      <P>Immigration Minister Philip Ruddock on Monday told the House of
Representatives that in the first five months of this year, up to
13,000 illegal migrants arrived in Australia by sea and by air, up
sharply from the same period last year. In all 33 boats were seized
during the period.</P>
      <P>In the past few years, about 12,000 illegals were detected in
Australia each year. "It is a significant increase in the number of
illegal immigrants to Australia this year," he said.</P>
      <P>The new arrivals came from mainland China, Vietnam, Thailand,
Pakistan, Bangladesh, Afghanistan, Iraq and areas in Eastern Europe.</P>
      <P>He said international smuggling syndicates, including those from
southern mainland China, are continuing to target Australia. The

in Australia because Canberra will offer them amnesty after the 2000

      <P>Ruddock and Deputy Prime Minister Tim Fischer said rumors are
being spread throughout mainland China that people can stay in
Australia after successfully landing here illegally.</P>
      <P>Ruddock said he had discussed the problems with mainland China's

human smuggling.</P>
      <P>"We intend to protect our territory not only in sea, but also by

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Lee Teng-hui announced on Monday
that the Republic of China will donate US$300 million to help Kosovar
refugees rebuild their homes.</P>
      <P>Lee made the announcement at a news conference held after
chairing a meeting on the Kosovo problems. The meeting was attended
by Vice President Lien Chan, Premier Vincent Siew, Foreign Minister
Jason Hu, and Ying Chung-wen, secretary-general of the National
Security Council.</P>
      <P>Lee said the ROC, as a member of the international community, has
consistently been concerned about world affairs and problems. "We
want to play an active role in the world arena and work together
with other members of the world society in maintaining world peace,"
Lee said, adding that the aid to displaced Kosovar refugees is
purely based on humanitarianism.</P>
      <P>Asked about his view on possible backlash from mainland
China, Lee said humanitarian aid to Kosovar refugees is a common
goal of all civilized countries.</P>
      <P>"Since the two sides of the Taiwan Strait co-exist in the

international peace and stability," Lee said.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,   June  7  (CNA)
(By Wendy Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The schedule for an improvement of
cross-strait relations and eventual reunification during the next
century depends on whether mainland China decides to walk down the
path of democracy, said Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman Su
Chi Monday.</P>
      <P>Su made the remarks in a speech entitled "Cross-Strait Relations
During the Next Century" on a local television program Monday
morning.</P>
      <P>Su said there are three obstacles to reunification: an imbalance
in mainland China's internal structure; the backward access to
information on the mainland; and less importance the mainland has
attached to cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>Su said mainland China is riding a bicycle supported only by the
two wheels of economic growth and nationalism; once economic growth
slows down, social unrest will follow.</P>
      <P>Su said if mainland authorities rely on economic development,
cross-strait relations will benefit, if they lean on nationalism
Taipei-Beijing relations will suffer.</P>
      <P>Secondly, Su said, because of its backward access to information
and ideology, mainland China frequently points a finger at others but
seldom reviews its own policies, this is especially true in terms of
China's policy toward Taiwan. It puts most of the blame on Taiwan,
and often misinterprets Taiwan's good intentions, he said.</P>
      <P>The third aspect impacting cross-strait relations is that
mainland places less emphasis on the issue, Su said, adding that
while cross-strait relationship is of national interest in Taiwan, it
is not a priority in mainland China.</P>
      <P>Su emphasized that in the long run, reunification depends on
mainland China's democratization while improvement of relations in
the near future will depend on the mainland's willingness to walk
down the path of democracy, he added.</P>
      <P>Su concluded that it is the government's hope that Taiwan and the
mainland can achieve mutual economic benefits, increase cultural
exchanges and strengthen political communication to achieve a
"win-win" situation.</P>

(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The final dumping site for Taiwan's nuclear
waste has yet to be determined, noted the head of the Taiwan Power
Company (Taipower) on Monday.</P>
      <P>Board Chairman of Taipower S.C. Hsi made the remark while
answering interpolations at the Legislature. Lawmakers were
concerned whether a decision had already been reached to dump nuclear
waste on the offshore islets of Wu Chiu or Hsiao Chiu near Matsu.</P>
      <P>Hsi, in denying a final site had been selected, said potential
dumping sites include North Korea and Russia. He admitted that
Taipower has also contacted the Chinese mainland about the
possibility of storing the waste.</P>
      <P>Government enterprises under the Ministry of Economic Affairs
made administrative reports Monday at the Economic and Energy
Resources Committee of the Legislative Yuan. The two main issues
of concern to the legislatures were the privatization of government
enterprises and if a storage site for nuclear waste had been
selected.</P>
      <P>The Taipower head said that intervention from outsiders had made
the storage problem much more complicated. He added that news that
the waste might be stored at foreign sites has resulted in pressure
from the international community.</P>
      <P>Taipower will do its best to provide local residents at the
potential dump sites with services according to the law as a way to
win their support, stressed Hsi.</P>
      <P>A foundation established to pay for the handling of nuclear waste
has accumulated NT$90 billion to date, and should increase by NT$10
billion every year, disclosed Hsi. The use of the fund will be
operated according to law, Hsi added.</P>

has also successfully diversified into other areas such as
telecommunications, the information industry, and petrochemicals.</P>
      <P>Although he hailed Taiwan Cement as a "model company" for all
Taiwan enterprises, Siew nevertheless urged the company to pay
greater heed to environmental protection, in light of the fact that
it is pushing for several investment projects in eastern Taiwan,
including the building of a cement plant, a power plant and a port.</P>
      <P>The premier, who had just returned from a tour of Central America

attention to environmental protection while making greater
contributions to Taiwan's sustained economic development.</P>
      <P>For his part, Taiwan Cement Chairman Koo Chen-fu, also a senior
advisor to President Lee Teng-hui, attributed his company's success

role in transforming Taiwan from an agrarian society to an advanced

Macedonia.</P>
      <P>"We hope the deal will help boost ROC-Macedonian exchanges and
friendship," Chao told Georgievski.</P>
      <P>For his part, Georgievski said Macedonia looks forward to
forging closer economic ties with the ROC and welcomes Taiwan
investment in his country.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, Georgievski toured a government-run
central Taiwan vocational training center. Georgievski said he was
impressed by the institution's facilities and its functions.</P>
      <P>Ting Wen-sheng, director of the vocational training center, said
Macedonia intends to commission the ROC to help train 2,000
Macedonians in machinery and woodworking skills. "Details concerning
the cooperative program will be worked out later," Ting said.</P>
      <P>In the company of ROC Ambassador-at-large Loh I-cheng
and ROC envoy to Macedonia Cheng Po-jeou, Georgievski and
his entourage also toured the Taichung Export Processing Zone and
visited several blue-chip companies, including Leadwell Computer Co.
and Hiwin Technology Corp.</P>
      <P>Ten-plus Macedonian business executives in Georgievski's
delegation visited major auto parts, machine tool and footwear
manufacturing companies in central Taiwan, which is the island's
machinery industry stronghold.</P>
      <P>This is Georgievski's first visit to the ROC since the
two countries forged formal diplomatic ties in January this
year, and Taichung was the first stop of his current visit. He and
his entourage flew to Taipei in the evening.</P>
      <P>In Taipei, the 33-year-old Macedonian prime minister first
met with ROC Premier Vincent Siew for wide-ranging talks. The
exchanged views on feasible measures to promote bilateral
exchanges and cooperation. Siew later hosted a dinner in honor of
Georgievski and his entourage.</P>
      <P>During his stay, Georgievski will also meet with President Lee
Teng-hui and other senior ROC officials on matters of mutual
concern.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Georgievski will sign an investment guarantee
agreement, a tax exemption accord and a free trade agreement with
Premier Siew to facilitate bilateral trade, investment and economic
cooperation.</P>
      <P>On Wednesday, Georgievski will preside over a ceremony marking
the inauguration of the Macedonian Embassy in Taipei.</P>

      <P>The 10th paragraph of CEP ITEM 0016 dispatched on June 5 Saturday
should read: "Georgievski told a news conference ... that
Macedonia's upcoming presidential election will not affect his
country's ties with the ROC." (Adding 'not' into the sentence.)</P>
      <P>A corrected repetition follows.
MACEDONIAN PM TO ARRIVE SUNDAY FOR 1ST OFFICIAL VISIT</P>
      <P>Taipei, June 5 (CNA) Macedonian Prime Minister Ljubco
Georgievski, leading a 59-member delegation, is scheduled to arrive
in Taipei on Sunday for a six-day official visit.</P>
      <P>This will be Georgievski's first visit to the Republic of China
since the two countries forged formal diplomatic ties in January
this year.</P>
      <P>Georgievski originally planned to visit Taiwan in February or
March. But his travel plan was postponed several times because of the
Kosovo crisis, which triggered the influx into Macedonia of a large
number of ethnic Albanian refugees from the neighboring Yugoslav
province of Kosovo.</P>
      <P>With the outlook in the Balkans brightening following Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic's consent to accept an international
peace plan for Kosovo, Georgievski has finally managed to realize his
long-planned Taiwan visit.</P>
      <P>During his stay, Georgievski will meet with President Lee
Teng-hui, Vice President Lien Chan, Premier Vincent Siew and other
senior ROC officials to discuss concrete measures to boost bilateral
relations and cooperation.</P>
      <P>Georgievski will chair a seminar to introduce Macedonia's
general investment climate, related regulations and development
potential to attract Taiwan entrepreneurs to invest in his nation.</P>
      <P>To facilitate bilateral trade, investment and economic
cooperation, Georgievski will sign an investment guarantee
agreement, a tax exemption accord and a free trade agreement with
ROC Premier Vincent Siew.</P>
      <P>On June 9, Georgievski will preside over a ceremony marking the
inauguration of the Macedonian Embassy in Taipei.</P>
      <P>The 33-year-old Macedonian prime minister is still on a visit to
the United States. He will travel directly from there to Taipei.</P>
      <P>Georgievski told a news conference in Washington, D.C. on
Friday that Macedonia's upcoming presidential election will not
affect his country's relations with the ROC.</P>
      <P>Even though the incumbent Macedonian president once opposed the
establishment of diplomatic ties with the ROC, Georgievski said that
problem has been resolved.</P>
      <P>By now, Georgievski said he does not see any problems in
bilateral relations between Macedonia and the ROC.</P>
      <P>He went on to say he believes that ROC-Macedonian economic
cooperation will be further strengthened following his visit to
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Georgievski complained that major countries around the world
have been reluctant to honor their promises of giving financial aid
to Macedonia whose economy has been seriously affected by the Kosovo
crisis. "The large number of Kosovar refugees is a heavy financial
burden for us," he complained.</P>
      <P>The ROC has donated US$2 million in cash to Macedonia to help
the former Yugoslav state cope with the refugee problems. In
addition, the ROC donated many relief goods, including
pharmaceuticals, medical equipment, and daily necessities, to
Kosovar refugees in Macedonia. It also sent a medical team to
Macedonia to offer free medical services to Kosovar refugees.</P>
      <P>The ROC attaches great importance to its relations with
Macedonia because the Balkan state is one of its only two diplomatic
allies in Europe.</P>

    <HEADLINE>COA TO STEP UP INSPECTION OF IMPORTED ANIMAL FEED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 7 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council of Agriculture (COA) and private
groups on Monday sought to allay public fears about
dioxin-contaminated animal feed making its way to Taiwan from
Belgium, saying that most of the island's feed comes from the United
States.</P>
      <P>However, the COA has decided for safety reasons to carry out
increased inspections of imported feed so as to ensure the safety of
the island's poultry.</P>
      <P>COA officials noted that because of the scare in Belgium over
livestock contaminated by cancer-causing dioxin, which has caused
European nations, the United States, and South Korea to ban livestock
products from Belgium, public concern about animal feed has also
risen.</P>
      <P>The officials said that Taiwan imports about 5 million tons of
corn and 3 million tons of soybeans from the United States every year
for animal feed, and added that most of the produce comes from the
central plains of the United States, far away from industrial areas.</P>
      <P>The US also has strict requirements regarding environmental
protection, and animal feed imported from there can be expected to be
safe, the officials said.</P>
      <P>The Poultry Association of the Republic of China said that the
feed imported by Taiwan's poultry industry has to be tested and
notarized on its levels of pesticide residue and humidity, and should
be considered safe.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the ROC Swine Industry Development Association said
that 95 percent of the feed for Taiwan's swine also comes from the
United States, while the remaining 5 percent comes from South Africa
and Thailand.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Former chairman of the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) Hsu Hsin-liang on Monday had high praise for
President Lee Teng-hui's announcement of an aid plan for Kosovo,
saying the move will win him international respect.</P>
      <P>Hsu made the remarks at a press conference following Lee's
announcement that the Republic of China will donate US$300 million to
help Kosovar refugees rebuild their homes.</P>
      <P>Hsu said Lee's aid plan is the best diplomatic move the
government has made in recent years, and added that it was a skilled
move on Lee's part to announce the plan through a press conference.</P>
      <P>Hsu said the ROC government has in the past placed too much
emphasis on how many allies it has, which not only incurs the wrath
of mainland China but also leads to smearing of Taiwan's
international image with allegations of "money diplomacy."</P>
      <P>Only the universal value of respect for human rights will win
global respect, Hsu said, adding that this is precisely the stand of
his own "new politics."</P>
      <P>Hsu also announced that he plans to visit Macedonia and Kosovo in
July to gain a first-hand understanding of the refugee problem there.
He said his "journey of history" will take him to the refugee camps
via Greece, together with a group of history scholars.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC BANS IMPORTS OF BELGIAN DAIRY, LIVESTOCK PRODUCTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  7 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan announced on Monday a temporary ban
on the import of dairy and livestock products from Belgium amid
fears that a toxic chemical had contaminated animal feed.</P>
      <P>The Board of Foreign Trade (BOFT) said the ban, effective from
Tuesday, covers milk, eggs, dairy and egg-based products, animal
feed, animal fat, poultry and livestock products originating from
Belgium.</P>
      <P>BOFT Director-General Chen Ryey-long said the government
initially will only ban imports of Belgian dairy and livestock
products.</P>
      <P>"We'll decide whether to ban similar products from Belgium's
neighboring countries and other European countries based on future
developments," Chen said.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan ban came after a decision by European leaders to
destroy chicken- and egg-based foodstuffs from Belgium. The
crackdown was spurred by the discovery that 400 poultry farms in
Belgium may have used animal feed contaminated with cancer-causing
dioxin. In addition, the Belgian government said the feed may have
gone to 500 pig breeders. And Belgian cattle are also being tested
for the highly toxic chemical. It is Europe's worst food safety
scare since the mad cow disease outbreak in Britain.</P>
      <P>The United States, Canada and many other countries have
announced import bans on Belgian livestock products.</P>
      <P>As Belgium is a foot-and-mouth disease- and New Castle
disease-infected area, Taiwan has long banned imports of poultry,
pork and beef from Belgium.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Taiwan has imported dairy products from Belgium.
According to BOFT tallies, Taiwan imported 89,452 kilograms of cream
butter, 370,165 kilograms of yoghurt, 107,475 kilograms of cheese
and 133,668 kilograms of dehydrated dairy fat from Belgium in the
first four months of this year.</P>
      <P>BOFT officials said local importers should divert Belgian dairy
products to other areas if those products are en route to Taiwan. If
the products have been loaded at Taiwan ports, they will be allowed
to enter the island only after they have been confirmed
to be free of contamination.</P>
      <P>As there are reports that fairy and livestock products in France
may have been contaminated with dioxin, the Bureau of Commodity
Inspection and Quarantine (BCIQ) said on Monday that dairy products
from France will also be subject to strict examination.</P>
      <P>BCIQ Director-General Chen Tso-chen said bureau staff already
started inspection of suspicious dairy products from Belgium and
France over the weekend.</P>
      <P>"We have collected samples from products on supermarket shelves
and sent them to the medical college of National Cheng Kung
University and the graduate institute of chemical engineering of
National Tsinghua University for examination," Chen said, adding
that final examination reports will be available in a week.</P>

      <P>Economic Minister Wang Chih-kang said on
Monday that he was received with courtesy on a recent trip to South
Korea, and that both sides have agreed to hold a ministerial-level
trade conference on fruit imports.</P>
      <P>Wang, who visited South Korea to attend the Asia Pacific Economic

President Kim Dae Jung to ask for South Korea's support for Taiwan's
bid for World Trade Organization (WTO) entry.</P>
      <P>In return, Taiwan would resume imports of South Korean fruit,
according to unnamed sources.</P>
      <P>There have been no formal ministerial-level channels of
communication between the two countries since the severing of
diplomatic ties in 1992.</P>
      <P>Regarding the resumption of bilateral ministerial-level meetings,
Wang said South Korea agreed to meetings on specific economic and
trade issues "when necessary," but sees no need for regular
conferences at present.</P>
      <P>Council of Agriculture Chairman Peng Tso-kui confirmed that South
Korea has formally demanded a resumption of fruit imports by Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In response to the South Korean demand of resumed fruit imports
in return for support for Taiwan's WTO entry, Peng said the imports
should be discussed on a "barter trade" basis, and not through WTO
multilateral trade talks.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC PLAN TO AID KOSOVAR REFUGEES TO BE IMPLEMENTED IN 2-5 YEARS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 7 (CNA)
(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Foreign Minister Jason Hu
said on Monday that Taiwan's US$300 million aid plan for Kosovar
refugees will be implemented in two to five years.</P>
      <P>He said that the decision to provide the assistance was made by
President Lee Teng-hui personally, and that it indicates Taiwan's
ability and willingness to contribute to the international community.</P>
      <P>Hu made the remarks following a press conference called by Lee
earlier on Monday in which he announced his humanitarian aid plan.</P>
      <P>The plan is focused on providing emergency refugee aid in the
form of clothing, food, commodities, housing and medical treatment,
as well as inviting refugees to receive professional training in
Taiwan, and supporting international rehabilitation projects in
Kosovo.</P>
      <P>Hu said that the ROC government has not yet worked out details of
the plan, but stressed that the Foreign Ministry will discuss
concrete contents with related government units "soon."</P>
      <P>He said that there will be no problem raising the money, but
added that it may take as long as two to five years to implement the
plan.</P>
      <P>With regard to the professional training plan, Hu said that
Taiwan has often considered offering such training courses, and
envisions groups of several hundred refugees coming to Taiwan for
six-month training programs focusing on television, computer and
automobile repair.</P>
      <P>Lee announced the aid plan to coincide with the visit to Taiwan
by Macedonian Prime Minister Ljubco Georgievski, but Hu declined to
say whether the recipients of the aid will be Taiwan's diplomatic
allies.</P>
      <P>"We have no political motivation. We hope to carry out the aid
plan through charity organizations, and we hope they will not reject
our offer," Hu said.</P>
      <P>So far, Taiwan has provided US$7 million for Kosovar refugees in
Macedonia, including US$2 million in cash and US$5 million in medical
treatment, food and clothing.</P>
      <P>Hu said that the aid plan was announced before the Yugoslav peace
resolution is concluded because Lee hopes to indicate Taiwan's
willingness to help as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>Taiwan paid a cash advance to Malaysia
for a purchase of liquefied natural gas (LNG) out of what Taiwan's
representative to Kuala Lumpur described on Sunday as "a spirit of
good-neighborliness."</P>
      <P>Speaking at a gathering of ethnic Chinese in Malaysia, Paul J.K.
Tso said that Taiwan has entered into a deal with Malaysia to
purchase LNG, and has made a down payment of US$250 million to
cash-strapped Kuala Lumpur in order to help the Southeast Asian
country ravaged by the Asian financial crisis.</P>
      <P>As the third-largest foreign investors in Malaysia, Tso said
Taiwan has funneled an accumulated US$8.6 billion into the country,
and has not been scared away by the financial crisis.</P>
      <P>As proof of its commitment to helping its Southeast Asian
neighbors out of their financial difficulties, Taipei has set up the
Southeast Asian Investment Co., with capital of US$300 million, to
boost its business investment in the region, said Tso.</P>
      <P>Lin Yien-wen, secretary-general of Taiwan's Overseas Chinese
Affairs Commission (OCAC), said at the meeting that OCAC's budget has
increased by 23 percent last year in defiance of Taiwan's own
economic crisis, a movement which vindicates the importance Taipei
attaches to its fellow Chinese overseas.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  7 (CNA)
(By David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The main opposition Democratic Progressive
Parry (DPP) has vowed to boycott the sending on Tuesday of a draft
amendment to the act governing the issuance of the national lottery
to the legislature's finance committee for screening.</P>
      <P>The DPP move is in protest against the ruling Kuomintang's
insistence that the central government should be in control of
issuing the lottery.</P>
      <P>The draft amendment is scheduled to be the subject of a floor
discussion, and it is expected that the KMT will mobilize its
legislative members to vote to send the draft to the Legislative
Yuan's finance committee for screening, much to the anger of the DPP
legislators.</P>
      <P>Chang Chun-hsiung, the DPP's general convenor at the Legislative
Yuan, described the KMT move as "illicitly helping its policy to pass
through the legislature."</P>
      <P>He also urged legislators elected from counties and cities in
southern Taiwan to take concerted action to oppose the draft
amendment, which would take the right of issuance away from local
governments.</P>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan passed the act governing the issuance of a
national lottery in 1995, stipulating that the issuance right belongs
to Taiwan Province and the two cities under the direct jurisdiction
of the Executive Yuan -- Taipei and Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>Chang pointed out that since the promulgation of the act, Taiwan
Province and Taipei and Kaohsiung cities have not yet formally issued
lottery tickets, and he questioned how the central government can now
withdraw the issuance right.</P>
      <P>He said the central government's claim that the revenue from the
national lottery under its control will be used to pay for a national
pension scheme is only an excuse, and added that the real reason for
the central government wanting to gain the issuance right is to
"steal money."</P>
      <P>In response, KMT said the draft amendment has been scheduled for
a floor discussion at the Legislative Yuan in accordance with a
resolution passed by the legislature's procedure committee last week,
and that the dispute between the two parties should be resolved at
that time.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  7 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's first steam train, which has just
received an elaborate face-lift, will go on public display once again
on Wednesday, the Taiwan Railway Administration (TRA) announced on
Monday.</P>
      <P>The announcement came at a ceremony marking the completion of the
refurbishment of the 112-year-old train, known as "Teng Yun (Flying
Cloud)."</P>
      <P>TRA officials said the refurbished antique train will make its
debut on Wednesday as part of celebrations of the anniversary of the
TRA's founding.</P>
      <P>The German-made train was built during the imperial Ching
dynasty. It was decommissioned in 1923 and has since been kept in a
courtyard adjacent to the Taiwan Museum in downtown Taipei.</P>
      <P>As the train was badly corroded through years of exposure to the
elements, the TRA decided to renovate it, and moved the train to the
TRA's Taipei workshop in March so that work could begin by a team
which included retired TRA engineers and craftsmen. After three
months of painstaking effort, the Teng Yun has now regained its past
glory.</P>
      <P>TRA officials said Germany and Holland also each have a steam
train of the same type, and added that the TRA plans to build five
or six replica steam trains patterned on the Teng Yun which will
run on various branch lines in order to attract more customers.</P>
      <P>The new steam trains will burn either natural gas or diesel, and
if the government approves the plan, the new trains can be completed
and start commercial operation by as early as next year.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the TRA will be selling 1,000 miniature versions of
the Teng Yun, which it commissioned from noted Japanese train model
manufacturing company KTM, at the Taipei Railway Station on
Wednesday. The trains will cost NT$35,000 each, and all proceeds will
be donated to welfare institutions around the island.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ACER AND IBM FORGE STRATEGIC ALLIANCE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  7  (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Acer Group on Monday forged an US$8
billion cooperation relationship with US-based computer giant IBM,
the most significant strategic alliance to date in Taiwan's
information sector.</P>
      <P>Acer Chairman Stan Shih and IBM Vice Chairman David Ernsberger
jointly announced the agreement at a Taipei news conference.</P>
      <P>The sum involved is expected to surge to more than US$20 billion
when Acer signs to become IBM's Asia-Pacific manufacturing center as
part of IBM's attempts to expand its personal computer (PC) division.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the seven-year contract, Taiwan's leading
computer maker will buy IBM hard disks and semiconductor chips, as
well as IBM products and technology relating to network and video.
Acer will sell computer parts and components, including monitors and
TFT-LCD panels, to its new partner.</P>
      <P>In addition, the two sides plan to jointly develop the so-called
"system on a chip" based on the IBM "Power PC" computer architecture,
in an effort to integrate computer peripheral devices like VGA and
sound cards, modems, and network cards, on a single chip, a product
that can also facilitate the computerization of household electrical
applicants.</P>
      <P>Shih described the new tie-up as Acer spending "a great deal of
money on the purchase of a small amount of IBM gold. Naturally, the
gold itself is valuable; but Acer is also keen to learn IBM's gold
refining know-how," Shih said, noting that Acer can sell IBM "gold"
as soon as it has the technology.</P>
      <P>The computer tycoon said that he believes IBM still owns
"diamonds," referring to the potential of the Acer-IBM cooperation
agreement. Shih added that Acer's goal is to equip every computer
with Acer parts and components made using key IBM techniques.</P>
      <P>However, he declined to comment on how much profit the Acer Group
will get from the deal. Acer is Taiwan's leading computer maker, with
1998 net profits of NT$2.49 billion (US$76.15 million).</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, it was announced that Taiwan's leading semiconductor
maker, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp. (TSMC), will on
Tuesday sign to buy a 30-percent share of Acer affiliate Acer-Texas
Instruments to manufacture silicon wafers.</P>
      <P>Local market observers described the upcoming deal as a three-way
profit arrangement, as Acer will see more on its net profit, TSMC
will obtain relief from its increasing demand, while Acer-Texas
Instrument will get rid of its huge deficit by turning itself from an
independent semiconductor maker into an order-processor for TSMC.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that with Acer-Texas Instrument's current
capacity of 300,000 eight-inch silicon chips per year, the company
can earn net profits of over NT$3 billion if it uses its production
lines to service process orders, a far better situation than its NT$5
billion deficit of last year.</P>

      <P>Legislators from the ruling Kuomintang on
Monday expressed their full support for President Lee Teng-hui's plan
to provide US$300 million as aid for Kosovar refugees, but New Party
legislators voiced their opposition to the idea.</P>
      <P>Tseng Yung-chuan, director of the KMT Department of
Party-government Coordination of the Legislative Yuan, said that the
aid plan is "in line with international justice and the spirit of
universal brotherhood."</P>
      <P>Chen Hung-chi (KMT, Taipei City) said the plan will improve
Taiwan's international image, and will help Taiwan's diplomatic ally,
Macedonia, to solve its pressing economic problems.</P>
      <P>But Feng Ting-kuo (New Party, Taichung County) said that such a
decision should have been announced by the premier rather than by the
president. He added that the government's financial situation is
tight at the moment, and that Lee should retract his announcement.</P>
      <P>Two other New Party legislators, Lai Shih-pao (Taipei City) and
Feng Hu-hsiang (Taipei City), pointed out that matters relating to
foreign aid are normally handled by the Foreign Ministry or the
Legislative Yuan, and they also criticized Lee for disregarding the
due process of government.</P>
      <P>The aid plan was initiated and announced by Lee at a hastily
convened press conference, but not before he called a high-level
meeting to discuss the plan.</P>
      <P>The officials present at the meeting included Premier Vincent
Siew, Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng, Presidential
Secretary-General Huang Kun-huei, National Security Council
Secretary-General Yin Tseng-wen and KMT Secretary-General John Chang.</P>
      <P>Foreign Minister Jason Hu said that he was told of the aid plan
by Lee when he returned to Taipei from an official visit to three
Latin American countries on Sunday night.</P>
      <P>He said that he gave a briefing on the aid plan to members of the
Foreign and Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee of the Legislative
Yuan shortly before Lee's announcement of the aid plan, and added
that most members of the committee supported the aid plan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FORMER KMT OFFICIAL CONVICTED IN RETRIAL OF SPYING FOR BEIJING</HEADLINE>

(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>One of two former Kuomintang officials
charged but acquitted of spying for Beijing was sentenced to one year
and two months imprisonment in a retrial on Monday, while the other
was acquitted again.</P>
      <P>In the first retrial of the case, We Taoming was found guilty by
the Taiwan High Court of leaking classified information concerning
affairs other than national defense.</P>
      <P>His alleged accomplice, Chang Lu-chung, who was also retried, was
again acquitted for lack of evidence, as he was by the same court in
October 1997.</P>
      <P>In throwing out the earlier acquittal for We, the court said that
during the investigation, he had admitted spying for Beijing, and
that his subsequent withdrawal of his confession on the grounds of
alleged coercion used by his interrogators was not convincing.</P>
      <P>We and Chang, who were released on bail after the first trial,
were not in court to hear the sentences. We's wife, however, who was
at court along with his lawyer, said her husband will certainly
appeal against the sentence.</P>
      <P>We, who also went by the name of Ng Wah, was chairman of the
Macau Association of Dr. Sun Yat Sen, the KMT's front-office in
Macau, while Chang was a KMT commissioner posted in Macau.</P>
      <P>They were accused of having been recruited by Beijing as spies
and of handing classified information over to their Beijing contact,
identified as Chang Yi, who is still at large. The information
included the list of delegates to the 14th KMT National Congress.</P>
      <P>In the first trial, the court refused to accept that the list of
KMT delegates was classified information, and threw out the case.</P>
      <P>The prosecutor appealed against the sentence to the Supreme
Court, which threw out the sentence and sent it back to the Taiwan
High Court for a retrial.</P>
      <P>At the retrial, the court decided that while the list did not
concern national defense, it was nevertheless secret infomation which
should not have been divulged to the Beijing regime.</P>

      <P>Republic of China Premier Vincent Siew on
Monday held 30-minute talks with visiting Macedonian Prime Minister
Ljubco Georgievski before hosting a dinner party for his guest.</P>
      <P>According to ROC Foreign Minister Jason Hu who was present at the
meeting, Siew and his Macedonian counterpart spoke of issues related
to the promotion of economic bilateral cooperation between the ROC
and Macedonia, and Georgievski reiterated the solid relations between
the two countries.</P>
      <P>Hu said Siew also explained to Georgievski the ROC's
humanitarian aid program for Kosovar refugees which President Lee
Teng-hui announced at a news conference earlier on Monday.</P>
      <P>The foreign minister said Georgievski "very much supports" Lee's
US$300 million emergency aid proposal, and that he suggested that the
ROC government should think of Macedonia as a "bridge" or an
"intermediary body," in which to purchase relief supplies.</P>
      <P>Lee's plan is focused on providing refugee aid in the form of
clothing, food, commodities, housing and medical treatment, as well
as inviting refugees to receive professional training in Taiwan, and

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 8 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said
on Tuesday it has no knowledge of foreign wire service reports that
the Republic of China will funnel US$10 billion to Central America
over the next seven years under a cooperation and investment plan.</P>
      <P>MOFA officials said the ministry is checking all related reports.</P>
      <P>An AFP report said on Monday that Timothy Tseng, an economic
advisor to the ROC Embassy in Costa Rica has told La Republica, a
Costa Rican daily, that Central America will receive a total of US$10
billion in investment capital or development funds for various
ROC diplomatic allies in line with the particular needs of each one.</P>
      <P>Central America is the ROC's diplomatic stronghold where many of
its allies are located.</P>
      <P>The AFP report said Costa Rican business leaders believe that
the planned aid from Taiwan and the US$9 billion promised by donor
nations at a Stockholm conference in May will help reinvigorate
regional economies devastated by hurricane Mitch last year.</P>
      <P>The ROC has donated funds to help its Mitch-stricken Central
American allies, including Costa Rica, rebuild their
battered economy. Meanwhile, private Taiwan business groups have
also pooled their resources to set up a joint-venture holding company
to facilitate investments in the region. All such moves are part of
the ROC's efforts to shore up its diplomatic relations with Central
American and Caribbean nations.</P>

Confucius' lesson of the day: "Men who, when they see what is
good and honest, try to act up to it, and when they see what is bad
and dishonest try to avoid it as if avoiding scalding water: such men
I have known and the expressions of such principle I have heard.

"But men who live in retirement in order to study their aims and
who practice righteousness in order to carry out their
principles: the expression of such principles I have heard, but I
have not seen such men."</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>LEGISLATORS MIXED OVER US$300 MILLION AID PLAN TO KOSOVAR REFUGEES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  8  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislators were mixed Tuesday in their
reaction to an announcement that the government will provide a huge
aid package to Kosovar refugees.</P>
      <P>Reacting to the announcement by President Lee Teng-hui on Monday
that the Republic of China will offer US$300 million in aid to
Kosovar refugees for humanitarian reasons, most of the legislators
from the ruling Kuomintang threw their support behind the plan.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Yang Chi-hsiung said that if the government can
assist Kosovar refugees, the move would win the respect of and
applause from the international community, especially at a time when
mainland China is squeezing Taiwan diplomatically by every means.</P>
      <P>But KMT Legislator Hung Hsing-jung said that the ethnic Albanian
refugees from the Yugoslavian province of Kosovo are not citizens of
an ROC ally. It is unacceptable to provide aid to them, when
government debt is near its legal ceiling, Hung said.</P>
      <P>Legislators from the opposition camp were unanimous in their
opposition to President Lee's plan, saying that the use of taxpayers'
money for such an aid plan ignores the dire financial situation at
home.</P>
      <P>Peng Shao-chin of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) said
the aid is not pragmatic, saying Taiwan should offer to help only
within its capacity. He said that he is adamant in his opposition,
especially because the government is trying to funnel the aid from
its reserve fund to try to circumvent the legislature.</P>
      <P>DPP legislator Tsong Chai questioned Lee's motive in providing
the aid, saying that the move has triggered speculation that Lee is
trying to boost his personal reputation in the international
community in hopes of winning a Nobel Peace prize.</P>
      <P>Chai urged the government to report clearly to the legislature on
how it reached the decision to provide the aid, as well as on the
government's motives and the purpose of the aid.</P>
      <P>Another DPP Legislator, Parris Chang, also said that if the
government wants to aid Kosovar refugees, the KMT should donate the
money, which he said would boost the KMT's image.</P>
      <P>Feng Hu-hsiang of the opposition New Party said that Lee's plan
to aid Kosovar refugees was a decision made by Lee alone, and his
generosity toward other countries ignores the suffering of his people
at home. Huang Yi-chao, an independent, echoed Feng's words.</P>

angina from suffering a heart attack, according to The Sydney Morning

      <P>The daily reported the drug -- tirofiban -- will be available to

patients who come to the emergency room with unstable angina,

      <P>Until Monday, all heart patients in Australia had been treated
with aspirin, a known blood thinner, and heparin, a coagulant, which
stops one part of the clotting process. But there had not been a drug
that could quickly stop the platelets from clumping together, the

      <P>One Nation, founded by Pauline Hanson in
1997, has been infiltrated by members of the US-based Ku Klux Klan
(KKK), and as a result the party was forced to expel two members
within one week.</P>
      <P>Hanson told reporters on Monday that there was no evidence that
the KKK was in Australia and that publicity about the KKK was a
"smear campaign" to denigrate her party. But her party's national
director, David Ettridge, expelled two party members -- identified as
Peter Coleman and Robert Leys -- within one week.</P>
      <P>The expulsions were made after Coleman and Leys told The Sydney

the United States to set up branches in New South Wales, Victoria and
Queensland.</P>
      <P>David Palmer, a former electrician from Sydney who describes
himself as the imperial wizard of the Australian KKK, said he is an

    <HEADLINE>TOO EARLY TO TELL IF MEGAWATI'S PDI-P WILL HAVE LANDSLIDE WIN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,   June  8  (CNA)
(By Sherman Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Monday's early voting tallies in
Indonesia, which show Megawati Sukarnoputri's party firmly in front,
should not be mistaken for an overall trend and could change
dramatically when results from non-urban centers filter in on
Tuesday, The Business Times reported.</P>
      <P>It is too soon to tell if Megawati's Indonesian Democratic Party
of Struggle (PDI-P) is headed for a landslide victory. Official
tallies will not be known for another two weeks, the sources said.</P>
      <P>The observers noted that the tallies released so far come from
only 42 percent in four provinces, namely East Java, Central Java,
Bali and South Sulawesi.</P>
      <P>These are areas where Golkar was not expected to do well, the
observers said, and where the PDI-P was known to have good support.</P>
      <P>There are more than 320,000 voting centers in 27 provinces. Some
112 million people, or 91 percent of the electorate, registered to
vote for the 462 seats at stake in a new Parliament.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the early tallies, observers said the results are
believed to have come from urban areas where the anti-Golkar mood is
strong.</P>
      <P>The PDI-P is also strong in Java and Bali. At several voting
centers in Jakarta, voters booed down Golkar each time the party's
name was mentioned while loud cheers and applause were reserved for
the PDI-P and other reformist parties.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MACEDONIAN PM WELCOMES ROC'S AID PLAN FOR KOSOVARS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   June   8  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Macedonia welcomes the Republic of
China's plan to offer up to US$300 million in aid to Kosovar
refugees, Macedonian Prime Minister Ljubco Georgievski said here on
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>"The ROC's aid initiative is more than acceptable," said
Georgievski, who arrived in Taipei on Sunday for his first official
visit to Taiwan since the two countries forged formal diplomatic
ties in January this year.</P>
      <P>ROC Minister-Counselor to Macedonia Cheng Po-jeou said it is
understandable that the Balkan state welocmes the ROC's aid plan
because it will help relieve Macedonia's current plight.</P>
      <P>Noting that Macedonia has a population of only about 2.2
million, Cheng said the influx into its territory of more than
280,000 Kosovar refugees in the past few months has had a serious
adverse impact on the Macedonian economy.</P>
      <P>In related news, the visiting Macedonian prime minister
personally chaired an investment seminar Tuesday morning to attract
Taiwan entrepreneurs to invest in his country.</P>
      <P>Georgievski told a packed audience at the Taipei International
Convention Center that now is the right time to invest in Macedonia
as the Kosovo crisis will soon be over with the imminent signing of
a peace agreement for the region.</P>
      <P>The 33-year-old prime minister said there are currently
16,000-plus NATO troops in Macedonia and that the number will
increase to 30,000 in the near future. In addition, more than 50,000
NATO servicemen are stationed in the neighboring Yugoslav province
of Kosovo.</P>
      <P>"The presence of NATO armed forces will help maintain political
and economic stability in Macedonia and its neighboring countries,"
Georgievski said, adding that Macedonia can serve as a gateway for
Taiwan businessmen to tap the vast European market.</P>
      <P>Georgievski cited advantages of the Macedonian investment
climate, including that Macedonia implements a highly liberal
economic system, enjoys a most-favored-nations status in the United
States, and maintains close ties with the 15-member European Union.</P>
      <P>"The Macedonia government is scheduled to negotiate with the EU
Executive Commission concerning its application for EU membership,"
Georgievski said, adding that Macedonia will also join the EU single
currency system. "In the not too distant future, Macedonian products
will be able to enter the EU market without any tariff barriers," he
said.</P>
      <P>In addition, Georgievski said Macedonia also maintains good
relations with non-EU European countries. "We have signed free trade
pacts with Yugoslavia, Croatia and Slovenia, and will soon sign
similar agreements with Turkey, Russia and Bulgaria," he added.</P>
      <P>Premier Vincent Siew, Vice Economics Minister Lin Yi-fu and more
than 100 senior executives from local conglomerates also attended
the seminar.</P>
      <P>Premier Siew said the ROC government has consistently encouraged
local companies to invest in Macedonia to help boost bilateral trade
and economic cooperation.</P>
      <P>Noting that the EU is the world's second largest consumer
market, Siew said he believes that Taiwan firms will benefit from
setting up trading footfolds or production facilities in Macedonia.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's exports to Europe posted a 6.7 percent gain in
1998 and the amount accounted for 17.8 percent of the island's total
outbound shipments, making the continent Taiwan's No. 2 export
market.</P>
      <P>In 1998, Taiwan exported US$1.86 million worth of goods to
Macedonia while imports from that country totaled only US$593,000.</P>
      <P>The ROC and Macedonia will co-sponsor another investment seminar
on Thursday, which will provide a forum for prospective Taiwan
investors to discuss possible joint-venture deals with Macedonian
business executives who are accompanying Georgievski on his six-day
visit here.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  8 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.
(TSMC), on Tuesday signed a letter of intent with the Acer Group to
buy 30 percent of the shares of Acer's semiconductor unit, the Acer
Semiconductor Manufacturing Inc (ASMI) at the cost of NT$ 5.47
billion (US$ 167.6 million).</P>
      <P>The deal between TSMC, Taiwan's largest semiconductor and Acer,
the world's thrid largest PC maker, will be the largest-ever in
Taiwan's information technology industry.</P>
      <P>After taking the shares, TSMC will become ASMI's largest share
holder and thus be entitled to take over ASMI's operations.</P>
      <P>The two groups will also forge a technology alliance, based on
TSMC's technology and expertise in marketing and management, that
aims to transform ASMI from a DRAM maker into a dedicated foundry
company.</P>
      <P>The partnership allows TSMC to further secure its leading
position in the global foundry business by utilizing ASMI's excess
capacity.</P>
      <P>TSMC chairman Morris Chang said in a statement that the deal
allows Acer to increase its global presence and position itself for
long-tern success.</P>
      <P>Acer Group Chairman Stan Shih said negotiations began one and a
half years ago. Acer decided to form a strategic alliance with TSMC
with the expectation that TSMC would lead ASMI toward its target of
becoming a professional wafer maker.</P>
      <P>"After TSMC takes over ASMI's management, Acer can concentrate on
developing its PC, peripheral and key component business as well as
explore opportunities in intellectual property and digital services",
said Shih.</P>
      <P>This cooperation shows that the IC and IT industries complement
each other and guarantees a promising future for both parties, Chang
noted.</P>
      <P>The Acer Group's alliance with International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM) and TSMC facilitates all three in any future
collaboration, Chang said. He also revealed that TSMC is currently
negotiating a strategic partnership with IBM.</P>
      <P>Tseng Fan-cheng, TSMC's general manager, will be formally
appointed as ASMI's president while other board members will be
elected in July, Chang noted.</P>
      <P>There will be only minor adjustments in ASMI's personnel with
most employees retaining their current positions, Tzeng said.</P>
      <P>Currently ASMI has a monthly capacity of 30,000 eight-inch wafers
with hopes to expand to 38,000 by the end of 2000.

(By Jay Chen and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The US Department of State said on
Monday it welcomes Taiwan's plan to offer US$300 million in aid to
Kosovar refugees and for reconstruction of their homeland -- the
Yugoslav province of Kosovo neighboring Macedonia.</P>
      <P>In response to a press inquiry, a State Department official
said: "We welcome assistance from the international community,
including Taiwan, to assist Kosovar refugees and Macedonia."</P>
      <P>As for details of Taiwan's aid initiative, the US official said:
"We refer you to the Taiwan authorities and the government of
Macedonia for details of Taiwan's reported offer of assistance."</P>
      <P>The official would neither confirm nor deny whether the Clinton
administration had asked Taiwan about its willingness to help
finance resettlement of Kosovar refugees or reconstruction of
their battered homeland. He just said the United States has
traditionally not made any comments on such kind of discussion.</P>
      <P>Statistics show that more than 782,000 ethnic Albanians have
been forced to leave Kosovo since Yugoslav troops began ethnic
cleansing in the region. Among them, 443,000 refugees fled to
Albania and some 247,000 swarmed to Macedonia.</P>
      <P>In addition to its previous aid, the US Congress recently
approved an additional US$37 million aid package to help Macedonia
cope with the Kosovar refugee problems.</P>
      <P>Taiwan unveiled a US$300 million aid package on Monday,
which will include emergency supplies for Kosovar refugees and
contributions to long-term reconstruction efforts by the
international community in Kosovo once a peace plan is accepted.
Moreover, it also offers to arrange for Kosovar refugees to receive
short-term technical training in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>ROC President Lee Teng-hui personally announced the aid package
to show Taiwan's sincerity to join the international drive to help
Kosovar refugees.</P>

(By Wendy Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's private business sector Tuesday
declared support for President Lee Teng-hui's US$300 million aid plan
to Kosovar refugees, saying that the public should pay close
attention to the aid's effect.</P>
      <P>Taicom Systems President Liu Kuo-chao, Taiwan Matsushita Electric
Co. President Hung Min-hung along with Paul Hsu, senior partner of
Lee and Li Attorneys-at-Law expressed their unanimous support at a
luncheon banquet given by the Chinese National Association of
Industry and Commerce in honor of Macedonian Prime Minister Ljubco
Georgievski.</P>
      <P>Hsu said domestic public and media should understand the
practical effect the Republic of China's (ROC) aid has on the Kosovar
refugee situation. For example, he said, after World War II the
Marshal Plan aided war-torn European nations.</P>
      <P>The countries that benefited from the Marshall Plan have rebuilt
their economies and now maintain good diplomatic relations with the
countries that provided the capital for the Marshall Plan, Hsu said.</P>
      <P>The public should not focus on the amount of aid Taiwan offers,
but rather on the aid's practical effect, Hsu pointed out, adding
that people should consider aid to other countries as another form of
investment.</P>
      <P>Liu also said the public should not calculate how much aid is
given, since the aid is based on humanitarian principles. He added
that the ROC government should continue to lend a helping hand to
nations in need.</P>
      <P>At the same time, he said, the government's plan to aid Kosovo
will help pave the way for future investments in Europe and help
establish long-term business relationships.</P>
      <P>Hung said if Taiwan aid to Kosovo causes European countries to be
more aware of the ROC, then Taiwan investors will be able to use
Kosovo as a base for expansion into the European market.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's economy will continue to grow in
1999 and 2000, with real growth reaching 5.0 percent and 5.5 percent
respectively, according to the latest Pacific Economic Cooperation
Council (PECC) forecast.</P>
      <P>Most economies of PECC member countries have shown evident
recovery since early this year, and the 19 countries in the group are
expected to post an average growth of 2.6 percent this year, the
1999-2000 PECC Pacific Economic Outlook indicated.</P>
      <P>The outlook indicated that while most member economies have
recovered from last year's doldrums, South Korea will be the only
country in the region to post a phenomenal "V" shaped bottoming out.</P>
      <P>Indonesia and Hong Kong, however, are forecast to continue
experiencing sluggishness this year, with their economies posting
negative growth of 2.5 percent and 0.5 percent respectively. Japan's
economy also is not promising, with zero growth, according to the
outlook.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the PECC report estimated that Taiwan's consumer
product index will rise 2.0 percent in 1999 and 2.5 percent in 2000,
while its export trade, which declined 9.4 percent in 1998, will soar
3.5 percent and 3.7 percent during the respective next two years.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's import trade, which posted negative growth of 8.5
percent in 1998, is forecast to expand by 2.7 percent in 1999 and 4.5
percent in 2000.</P>
      <P>The PECC also forecasts that Taiwan's monetary policy will remain
easy.</P>
      <P>Founded in 1980, PECC is an informal international organization
grouping 19 members. Each member country has a PECC committee
composed of government officials, academics and industrialists.</P>
      <P>Taiwan joined PECC in 1986 under the name of "Chinese Taipei."
Other members of the group include Australia, Canada, Chile, mainland

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  8  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice Foreign Minister David Lee said on
Tuesday that the Republic of China will offer US$10 million in aid
to Macedonia in the next two to three months.</P>
      <P>Lee said the fund is part of a US$300 million aid package for
Kosovar refugees announced by ROC President Lee Teng-hui on Monday.</P>
      <P>The vice minister said the aid package is not targeted at any
single country nor is it drafted at the request of any country.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Lee said the government will certainly give top
priority to assisting Macedonia, one of the ROC's two diplomatic
allies in Europe.</P>
      <P>Lee went on to say that US$300 million is the ceiling of the
newly unveiled aid package and that it has yet to be decided how
long the package will be implemented.</P>
      <P>Lee said the proposed US$10 million aid to Macedonia has been
included in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' budget plan for the
current fiscal year, which ends on June 30.</P>
      <P>"Therefore, the aid can be provided before the end of June.
Nevertheless, we must still discuss with Macedonian authorities
details of the aid program, including how Macedonia will use the
fund," Lee said, adding that the issue will be discussed during
Macedonian Prime Minister Ljubco Georgievski's current visit here.</P>
      <P>Lee further said Foreign Minister Jason Hu had fully taken part
in the planning of the US$300 million aid package.</P>
      <P>Commenting on questions from some legislators about the source
of the needed fund, Lee said the government will raise funds
strictly according to existing budget law and the process will
certainly be subject to parliamentary supervision.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, government spokesman Chen Chien-jen said part of the
aid will be used in purchasing Taiwan-produced products and
equipment. "As a result, domestic industries will also benefit from
the aid package," he added.</P>

      <P>The legislature on Tuesday adopted to send a

lottery to a joint meeting of the finance, health and environmental
protection, social welfare, and judicial committees for screening.</P>
      <P>After voting three times, the legislature passed the draft

      <P>The major opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) strongly
opposed the sending of the draft amendment to be screened by the

      <P>The Legislative Yuan passed the act governing the issuance of
the national lottery in 1995, stipulating that the issuance right
belongs to Taiwan Province and the two cities under the direct
jurisdiction of the Executive Yuan -- Taipei and Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>The draft amendment to the act, sent to the Legislative Yuan by
the Executive Yuan, would take the right of issuance away from local

      <P>Feng Ting-kuo, an opposition legislator from the New Party, said
since the central government wants to gain the issuance right, the

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>In response to a call by President Lee
Teng-hui, Finance Minister Paul Chiu confirmed on Tuesday that his
ministry has started working on a draft plan to establish a "national
stabilization" fund.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the major purpose of the fund is to help stabilize
the local financial market, Chiu said the government will consider
using its revenues from stock transaction taxes, postal savings, land
sales, release of shares by state-run enterprises, and other various
government funds, as a way of raising money for the proposed fund.</P>
      <P>Chiu did not reveal the scale of the planned fund, saying only
that it will be large enough to help stabilize the local stock
market. The fund is expected to be officially established by the end
of next year at the earliest, pending approval from the Legislative
Yuan, he added.</P>
      <P>President Lee proposed the fund on Monday during a meeting with a
group of local small business leaders, saying it would help tackle
the impact of free international capital movement on the domestic
financial market after Taiwan joins the World Trade Organization.</P>
      <P>Although admission to the world trade regulatory body will help
Taiwan achieve greater economic liberalization and globalization, Lee
warned that local small businesses will face greater foreign
competition as a result.</P>
      <P>In light of the increased short-term foreign capital movement in
and out of Taiwan, Lee said it is necessary for the government to do
something to minimize the expected impact.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, speaking at an ROC-Philippines economic forum, Y.P.
Chu, a researcher at Academia Sinica, contended that Lee's proposal
is a feasible way of balancing the advantages and disadvantages
brought about by foreign capital movement.</P>
      <P>Analyzing in terms of supply and demand, Chu said Taiwan is a
capital export country, and that the setting up of such a
stabilization fund will help build public confidence in case of large
amounts of foreign capital withdrawal.</P>
      <P>Wu Rong-i, president of the Taiwan Institute of Economic
Research, a major domestic think tank, also praised Lee's suggestion
as a good idea which he said can help the country establish a

    <TEXT>
      <P>ROC naval authorities denied on Tuesday
that the Chungshan Institute of Science and Technology's (CIST's)
research program on electronic warfare system to be installed on
Lafayette-class frigates has turned out to be a flop.</P>
      <P>Lai Kuang-shu, a department chief at the Navy General
Headquarters, told a news conference at the Ministry of National
Defense that the CIST has delayed in completing testing of the new
electronic warfare system, but the whole project has been proceeding
smoothly.</P>
      <P>"We are confident that the institute will be able to finalize
the whole project within the specified period of time," Lai said.</P>
      <P>Noting that the Navy has commissioned the CIST to develop
electronic warfare system for its six French-made Lafayette-class
frigates in line with the government's defense self-reliance
principle, Lai said the CIST has rich experience in
developing command-control-communications systems for various types
of naval ships.</P>
      <P>"All CIST-development electronic warfare systems have managed to
meet the requirements of different types of our warships," Lai said,
adding that few countries in the world are willing to export their
sophisticated electronics warfare systems.</P>
      <P>Lai, who once served as commander of Navy's Lafayette
fleet, said the French-made frigates have superb air-defense and
anti-submarine capabilities. "Their performance will be further
enhanced after installation of the CIST-development electronic
warfare system," he added.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, Chen Chung-yi, a CIST division
chief, said the CIST has managed to overcome many unexpected
difficulties and problems in developing electronic warfare system
for Lafayette-class frigates, also known as Kangting-class frigates.</P>
      <P>Chen said the electronic warfare system must undergo testing at
depot, in coastal areas and on seas. "The system has already passed
depot tests and will soon undergo coastal testing," Chen said,
adding that he is confident that all the remaining test work can be
fulfill as scheduled by the end of June.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Ministry of National Defense said it has set up a
special task force to handle all unexploded bombs in various

      <P>Taipei is seeking the right to issue visas
directly in Macau for residents of the Portuguese enclave wishing to
go to Taiwan, an ROC official in charge of Macau affairs said on
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>William Li, head of the Taipei Trade and Tourism Office in Macau,
said his office is seeking to obtain permission from the Macau
authorities for that purpose, because "such a development in
bilateral Taiwan-Macau ties would benefit the interests of Macau's
residents."</P>
      <P>Li said he remains optimistic that his office will receive
approval from the Macau government. He said he will find an
"appropriate time" to discuss the issue with relevant Macau
officials.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the question of whether his office -- the Republic

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN EXPORTS IN MAY EXCEEDED US$10 BILLION--HIGHEST IN 18 MONTHS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  8  (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's exports in May totaled US$10.64
billion, the highest since Dec. 1997, according to statistics
released by the Ministry of Finance (MOF) on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>In comparison with the same month last year, exports
in May registered a growth of 13.7 percent to create a trade surplus
of US$1,830 million, the highest figure since Dec. 1996.</P>
      <P>If viewed from the value of average daily customs clearance in
exports, the daily average export value in May was US$443 million, an
increase of 6.3 percent from that of May 1998, an indication that
Taiwan's export prospects are brightening.</P>
      <P>The May performance was a result of an export increase of 13.6
percent to the US and an increase of at least 29 percent to Japan and
to the Association of South East Asian Nations region, pointed out
Hsu Kuo-chung, director of MOF's Department of Statistics, at a press
conference.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's exports to Asian nations in May accounted for 50.32
percent of the island's total exports, the largest since Sept. 1997,
proving the economies in the Asian region have recovered, Hsu noted.</P>
      <P>The total exports to the Asian region in May valued US$5.35
billion, the highest since Dec. 1997. Exports have now scored
positive growth for three consecutive months, Hsu added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taiwan's imports from the US rose 2.5 percent in May,
the first positive growth in 14 months, according to the MOF figures.</P>
      <P>In view of the fact that the shadow of the Asian financial
turmoil has gradually faded away, the Wharton Econometric Forecasting
Association has predicted that global trade will grow by 3.2 percent
in 1999, and that the Asian region, after having bottomed out, will
recover this year.</P>
      <P>If stable economic growth is maintained in Europe and in the US,
Taiwan's exports will benefit, Hsu noted.</P>
      <P>In addition, said Hsu, the construction of Taiwan's multi-billion
dollar high-speed railway, the largest-ever infrastructure project on
the island, will enter into its primary construction stage next year,
which will be an incentive for private investment.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, Taiwan's economic prospects are robust,
stressed Hsu.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 8 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The 1999 Taiwan-Philippines Forum opened in
Taipei on Tuesday to discuss the prospects of economic development
and cooperation between the two countries.</P>
      <P>Jeffrey Koo, chairman of the Taiwan-based Chinatrust Commercial
Bank, opened the one-day forum which was jointly sponsored by the
Taiwan Institute of Economic Research and the Philippines' Center for
Research and Communication.</P>
      <P>In an address at the opening ceremony, Liu Yi-shan, vice chairman
of the Council for Economic Planning and Development, noted that the
Philippines is Taiwan's 12th-largest export market, while Taiwan is
the Philippines' fifth-largest source of foreign investment.</P>
      <P>Despite the financial crisis which swept through Asia from
mid-1997, bilateral trade has shown steady growth, Liu said.</P>
      <P>But he said that Taiwan businessmen in the Philippines have
reported that in Subic Bay, the main investment center for Taiwan
businessmen in the Philippines, water prices are set to increase from
six pesos to 32 pesos per unit from July, a development which is
causing concern among the Taiwan businessmen there.</P>
      <P>Liu also urged the Philippines to sign a free trade agreement
with Taiwan as soon as possible, adding that according to studies by
the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research, this will help upgrade
Taiwan's competitiveness and speed up the economic development of the
Philippines.</P>
      <P>Koo said that although Taiwan businessmen traditionally invest in
mainland China because of similarities in language and customs,
Southeast Asian countries are some of the world's major export
markets, and he predicted that Southeast Asia will increasingly
become the focus of Taiwan investors.</P>
      <P>Koo noted that the Philippines has ample resources and labor and
is Taiwan's 5th-largest source of foreign laborers and 15th-largest
trading partner.</P>
      <P>However, he added, both sides still have room for growth, and
Taiwan is hoping to combine the resources and advantages of both
nations to provide more commodities and services to the rest of the
world.</P>

in Macedonia, including the very liberal economic system, its
most-favored nation status in the United States, and its geographical
and commercial proximity to the 15-member European Union.</P>
      <P>He noted that Macedonian officials will meet with EU authorities
on June 21 for talks on Macedonia's EU accession. Once Macedonia
becomes an EU member using Europe's unified currency, commodities
originating in Macedonia will enjoy duty-free customs clearance in

    <HEADLINE>FORMER TAIWAN GOVERNOR VISITS JAPAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Tokyo, June 8 (CNA)
(By Mike Chang and Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Taiwan Provincial Governor James Soong
arrived in Japan on Tuesday for a five-day private visit aimed at
meeting with friends from Japan's political, trade and industrial
sectors.</P>
      <P>Soong was invited by the Japanese alumni association of the
University of California at Berkeley to deliver a series of speeches.</P>
      <P>Upon his arrival, Soong said that he intends to obtain Japan's
opinions on the Republic of China, to reveal Taiwan's current state,
and to highlight the ROC's attitude toward East Asian affairs.</P>
      <P>He said he hopes Japan can understand that Taiwan pays great
attention to the US-Japan security agreement, from the point of view
of its own security and of the entire Asia-Pacific region.</P>
      <P>He also said he would like to exchange views with Japanese
politicians on Taipei-Tokyo relations in the 21st century.</P>
      <P>Soong will deliver his first speech at the Josui Kaikan building
Wednesday, and will deliver another the following day at a conference
hall of the Upper House members building on ROC-Japan relations in
the new century, according to Soong's entourage.</P>
      <P>Before his departure for Japan, Soong was asked to comment on
President Lee Teng-hui's US$300 million Kosovar refugee aid program,
and responded that while it is "nice" that the Republic of China is
playing a contributory role as a member of the international
community, it should "assess its strength before acting."</P>
      <P>This is the former governor's third foreign visit in a month
following trips to the Philippines and the United States. The trips
are considered as part of Soong's attempts to boost his presidential
bid, despite the fact that he has yet to announce whether or not he
will run in the 2000 election as an independent.</P>
      <P>Soong ended his public service career as Taiwan's first and last
popularly elected governor late last year. Prior to that post, he
served as director-general of the Government Information Office, and
as secretary-general of the ruling Kuomintang.</P>
      <P>A loyal KMT member, Soong's relations with the largest political
party in Taiwan, however, have soured after the KMT-controlled
central government downsized the Taiwan Provincial Government as part
of its efforts to upgrade administrative efficiency.</P>
      <P>Other reports have said that Soong's supporters are arranging for
him to visit Hong Kong in July, with the aim of further expanding his

      <P>A seminar designed to promote strategic
alliances between Taiwan's semiconductor industrialists and their
European counterparts will be held in Paris in November, economics
officials said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>In a move to help Taiwan's semiconductor industry gain a foothold
in Europe, the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the China External
Trade Development Council are encouraging European semiconductor and
electronic companies to take part in the Paris seminar, the officials
said.</P>
      <P>A dozen local firms, running the whole gamut of IC design,
manufacture, packaging and testing, will be selected to take part in
the seminar slated for Nov. 15-16, said the officials.</P>
      <P>The European Union, with a population of 370 million and a gross
net production of US$8.4 trillion in 1998, is the world's biggest
single market in general terms. Its semiconductor industry posted a
growth of 1.4 percent for a total value of US$28.4 billion in 1998 in
defiance of the worldwide recession in the industry.</P>
      <P>The EU semiconductor market is the second-biggest in the world
after the United States, said the officials, and is forecast to grow
by 7.8 percent in 1999 to US$30.7 billion, more than half of which
will depend on imports. This provides a potential opportunity for
Taiwan companies wishing to exploit the market, the officials added.</P>

      <P>Belgian dairy and livestock
products contaminated by the cancer-causing dioxin have sparked panic
in Taiwan, and many stores have taken Belgian food products off their
shelves to ease consumer worries.</P>
      <P>The Bureau of Commodity Inspection and Quarantine (BCIQ) under
the Ministry of Economic Affairs on Tuesday announced that all dairy
and livestock imports from Belgium, France and the Netherlands must
pass inspection before going on the shelves, effective immediately.</P>
      <P>While it is not compulsory for stores to take Belgian food
products off their shelves, the BCIQ has asked supermarkets and chain
stores to cooperate, and urged the public not to buy such products.</P>
      <P>To protect their reputations and set their customers' minds at
rest, many stores have already removed the offending products from
their shelves.</P>
      <P>The 7-11 chain of convenience stores said that while most of
their products come from reputable domestic distributors, they have
still asked suppliers to provide documents showing that Belgian food
products are contamination-free.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, in the southern port city of Kaohsiung, the Health
Department conducted an overall inspection of 52 of the city's
biggest supermarkets on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>No Belgian egg or poultry products were discovered during the
inspection, but inspectors found a "high calcium, iron and fiber"
non-fat powdered milk manufactured by Belgium's Orimex S.A. in one
supermarket, which was immediately taken off the shelves until the

      <P>Defense Minister Gen. Wiranto is seen as
holding the trump card in Indonesia's presidential election later
this year, according to The Sydney Morning Herald on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>In a dispatch from Jakarta, correspondent Raphael Pura reported
that in the contest to select Indonesia's next president, Wiranto
holds a possible trump card, because the military remains a
potentially decisive force in Indonesia following elections on June
7, when 462 members of Parliament were chosen.</P>
      <P>The daily quoted Indria Samego, a military analyst and adviser to
President B.J. Habibie, as saying, "The armed forces will become a
beauty queen. Everybody will want to have a special relationship with
her."</P>
      <P>Wiranto, who was instrumental last year in replacing former
President Suharto with Habibie, could determine whether the incumbent
president keeps his job. It is also possible that he will side with
Megawati Sukarnoputri, the leader of the Indonesian Democratic Party

    <DATELINE>Hualien,  eastern  Taiwan,  June  8  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A baby Risso's dolphin
which was found beached on Chishingtan Beach in eastern Taiwan's
Hualien County on Tuesday morning was shipped to the southern city of
Pingtung later in the day for medical treatment.</P>
      <P>The dolphin, believed to be two or three months old, was first
spotted by a local man who was taking a walk on the beach. He pushed
the dolphin back into the sea hoping it would swim away, but the
young animal soon washed ashore and grounded on the beach a second
time.</P>
      <P>The man then called the police and the Hualien county government
for help, in the meantime using an umbrella to provide shade for the
dolphin and pouring water on it to keep it moist.</P>
      <P>Police arrived, as well as experts from the county government's
Wildlife Conservation Committee, only to find that they lacked the
expertise and equipment to save the animal, which by this time was
close to death.</P>
      <P>Staff from the Hualien Fishermen's Association also joined the
rescue effort, and offered to carry the dolphin to their
headquarters, where there were better facilities to help the stricken
animal.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Taipei-based Taiwan Cetacean Society was called
for help. Society representatives led by veterinarian William Chi
immediately rushed to the fishermen's association to help with the
rescue.</P>
      <P>Chi found that the dolphin needed professional care, and
suggested that the mammal be transported south to Pingtung where the
Ocean Museum there was believed to be capable of taking care of the
animal.</P>
      <P>Since the trip from Hulien to Pingtung takes several hours by
road, Hualien Magistrate Wang Ching-feng telephoned the Cabinet-level
Council of Agriculture and the Ministry of National Defense (MND) to
ask for a transport plane to take the dolphin by air. However, the
MND turned town the plea, saying that the job was beyond the scope of
the air force's capabilities.</P>
      <P>The baby dolphin was at last loaded aboard a specially adapted
truck for the trip to Pingtung. As of press time, the animal was on
the road, heading for an uncertain fate.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SIEW CABINET PARTIALLY RESHUFFLED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 9 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China Cabinet is undergoing
a minor reshuffling, after Education Minister Lin Ching-chiang
resigned over an illness, sources from the Executive Yuan reported on
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Premier Vincent Siew on Tuesday appointed former Vice Education
Minister Yang Chao-hsiang, currently chairman of the Research,
Development and Evaluation Commission, to succeed Lin as education
minister.</P>
      <P>Yang's vacancy, meanwhile, will be filled by Wei Chi-lin,
director-general of the Central Personnel Administration.</P>
      <P>Wei will be succeeded by Chang Che-shen, deputy secretary-general
of the Executive Yuan, according to the sources.</P>
      <P>The partial reshuffle was endorsed by the ruling Kuomintang
Wednesday during a meeting of the Central Standing Committee.</P>
      <P>President Lee Teng-hui, in his capacity as chairman of the
Kuomintang, lauded Lin for making commendable contributions to
Taiwan's educational reforms.</P>
      <P>The new nominations are expected to be formally approved by the
Executive Yuan in a meeting Thursday.</P>
      <P>Premier Siew accepted Education Minister Lin's resignation on
Tuesday when Siew visited Lin at his hospital room.</P>
      <P>The 59-year-old Lin tendered his resignation in late May for
health reasons. In a formal statement on May 31, Lin said that
leaving the ministerial post would allow him to concentrate on
undergoing treatment for a brain tumor. The resignation was necessary
to prevent his health from affecting his duties as education
minister, he said.</P>
      <P>According to doctors at Veterans General Hospital, where Lin is
being treated, Lin was found to have a malignant brain tumor late
last year, and has since received chemotherapy.</P>
      <P>The minister has begun to experience convulsions on the right
side of his body, and doctors said Lin feels that the convulsions and
the difficulty he has walking, for which he is now using a cane,
could adversely affect his public image. That is why he has decided
to resign, they said.</P>
      <P>Doctors said that Lin's illness would not affect his ability to
work, adding that his current condition is good. His right leg,
however, is still weak and will take time to recover.</P>
      <P>As education minister, Lin championed many educational reforms
and was praised for his advocacy of lifelong learning.</P>
      <P>Lin assumed his post in February 1998.</P>
      <P>President Lee, meanwhile, confirmed Yang, Wei and Chang's
nominations.</P>
      <P>Yang Chao-hsiang, the newly appointed education minister, is 52
years old, and has a Ph.D. in industrial education from the
University of Pennsylvania. He has been professor at National Taiwan
Normal University and vice education minister.</P>
      <P>Wei Chi-lin, 52, who has a Ph.D. in humanity sciences from the
University of Paris, France, has been professor at National Taiwan
University's College of Business, and a researcher at the Executive
Yuan's Economic Reform Committee.</P>
      <P>Chang Che-shen, 54, who has a master's degree in accounting from
Central Michigan University in the United States, has been deputy
director-general of the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and
Statistics of the Executive Yuan.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of National Defense (MND)
Wednesday declined comments on reports that the Republic of China
was involved in a corruption charge in Israel.</P>
      <P>The ministry also stressed that the ROC's overseas arms
purchases have been conducted through normal channels and legal
processes.</P>
      <P>Foreign wire service reports said on Tuesday that Taiwan might
have been involved in corruption charges against Shimon Sheves, a
top aide of the late Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin.</P>
      <P>The reports said Sheves, director-general of the Prime Minister's
Office under Rabin, was charged with several counts of fraud, abuse
of confidence and bribe taking.</P>
      <P>Israeli prosecutors charged that Sheves received a bribe of
US$80,000 to help secure an arms contract between an Israeli firm
and a foreign country, and sought a further bribe of US$5 million.</P>
      <P>According to foreign wire service reports, the indictment did
not name the country in question but Israeli media reports said it
was Taiwan.</P>
      <P>MND officials said the ministry is not in a position to make any
comments on foreign judicial cases. Moreover, they said Israeli
judicial authorities did not confirm that the Sheves case is related
to any foreign country.</P>
      <P>MND officials further said it is the ministry's established
policy of refraining from commenting on any reports concerning its
weaponry deals. "We must respect positions of other countries
involved in those deals," said an MND spokesman.</P>

dagger and dies at the age of 31. His early reign was dominated by
his mother, Agrippina the Younger. He had his mother and wife
murdered, and he may have set the Great Fire of Rome in 64. His
cruelty and irresponsibility provoked widespread revolts which led to
his suicide.

1672: Peter I, Russian emperor known as "Peter the Great," is
born. He extended Russian territory around the Baltic and Caspian
shores, reformed the administration of the state, and founded St.
Petersburg as a new capital.

which Hong Kong is leased to Britain from China for a period of 99
years.

1902: West Point graduates celebrate the 100th anniversary of
their alma mater.

1908: King Edward VII of England visits Tsar Nicholas II on
board the royal yacht in the Baltic Sea, the first meeting between a
British monarch and a Russian tsar.

1916: Robert McNamara, American industrialist, is born. He was
defense secretary during the Vietnam War, and president of the World
Bank from 1968 to 1981.

1928: The ROC's Academia Sinica is established with Tsai
Yuan-pei as its first president.

1940: The king and prime minister of Norway order their troops
to stop fighting at midnight, surrendering to the Nazis.

1951: The judgment of the Nuremberg court is fulfilled in the
United States as the noose slips over the head of the last Nazi
condemned to hang for "crimes against humanity. In all, 24 of
Hitler's top men were accused on a number of different counts. Twelve
men, including Nazis Hermann Goering and Joachim von Ribbentrop, were
given the death penalty.

1959: The United States launches the George Washington, the first
nuclear submarine with Polaris missiles.

1967: Israel seizes the Golan Heights on the fifth day of war
with Syria, Egypt, and Jordan.

1975: The Republic of China terminates its diplomatic relations
with the Republic of the Philippines as Manila recognizes the Chinese
communist regime.

1982: ROC President Chiang Ching-kuo praises US President Ronald
Reagan's call for a campaign to promote democracy and consign
communism to the "ash heap of history."

1986: The Ministry of Foreign Affairs agreed to use the name
"Chinese Taipei" when participating in the women's World Cup
basketball championships in Moscow in August.

1989: In mainland China, show trials of the leaders of the
demonstrations in Tienanmen Square begin in Beijing.

1991: Mount Pinatubo, a volcano northwest of Manila that had been
dormant for more than 600 years, erupts and forces the evacuation of
US troops from their airbase nearby.

1995: The ROC President Lee Teng-hui delivers a speech titled
"Always in My Heart," at his alma mater, Cornell University.

1995: The Parliament of Japan passes a controversial resolution
designed to atone for the country's role in World War II.

1996: Thailand celebrates the 50th anniversary of the coronation
of King Bhumibol Adulyadej.

1996: Communist China releases dissident Ren Wanding after seven
years in prison following the 1989 democracy demonstrations.

cannot make yourself agreeable in conversation. If you do not study
the arts, you will lack judgment and taste."</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>MACEDONIAN EMBASSY IN TAIPEI INAUGURATED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  9  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Macedonian Embassy in the Republic of
China was formally inaugurated in Taipei on Wednesday to facilitate
bilateral exchanges.</P>
      <P>It is Macedonia's 29th embassy around the world. Macedonian
Prime Minister Ljubco Georgievski said at the inaugural ceremony
that the embassy opening marks a new beginning for ROC-Macedonian
relations.</P>
      <P>"I believe that cooperation between our two countries will
become ever more cordial and closer following the inauguration of
our embassy here," said Georgievski, who arrived in Taipei on Sunday
for a six-day official visit.</P>
      <P>Verka Modanu, Macedonia's first resident minister-counselor to
Taipei, said the embassy will soon start visa services for
prospective Taiwan visitors to Macedonia.</P>
      <P>Modanu said many Taiwan business executives have expressed
interest in traveling to Macedonia for market surveys and exploring
possible investment or joint-venture opportunities.</P>
      <P>Modanu, who speaks fluent mandarin Chinese, said the embassy
will add a commercial affairs division in the near future to promote
bilateral trade and economic cooperation.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, Macedonian Foreign Minister
Aleksandar Dimitrov said the ROC and Macedonia have forged formal
diplomatic ties for only 133 days.</P>
      <P>During this short period, Dimitrov said, Macedonia's
parliamentary speaker, information minister and prime minister have
led large delegations to visit Taipei, and ROC Foreign Minister Jason
Hu also has made an official visit to Macedonia.</P>
      <P>"All these visits indicate that both sides are active in
spinning a comprehensive framework to facilitate bilateral
cooperation in trade, economic and political fields," Dimitrov said.</P>
      <P>When Macedonia announced its decision to establish diplomatic
ties with the ROC in January this year, Dimitrov said some skeptics
questioned Macedonia's wisdom. "At that time, we said we want to
learn from Taiwan's developmental experience. Our prime minister's
current visit signifies our determination to fulfill our goal,"
Dimitrov said, adding he believes that Georgievski's visit will lay
a solid foundation for future development of ROC-Macedonian
relations.</P>
      <P>ROC Vice Foreign Minister David Lee, who attended the inaugural
ceremony on behalf of Foreign Minister Jason Hu, said the
inauguration of the Macedonian Embassy has opened yet another
"door" for bilateral exchanges. Minister Hu was on a sick leave.</P>
      <P>Lee said he is convinced that the "Taiwan experience" will
flourish in Macedonia through concerted efforts of the embassies of
the two countries. The ROC Embassy in Macedonia began operations
in April.</P>
      <P>To boost bilateral trade and economic cooperation, the ROC and
Macedonia signed an investment guarantee agreement, a tax exemption
accord and an economic cooperation accord.</P>
      <P>The agreements were signed by ROC Economics Minister Wang
Chih-kang and Macedonian Trade Minister Nikola Gruevski on behalf of
their respective governments.</P>
      <P>In addition, the two countries are discussing several other
agreements, including an accord on cooperation in customs services,
a free trade zone pact and a loan agreement, to speed up bilateral
engagements.</P>
      <P>Georgievski is heading a 59-member delegation, composed of
senior Macedonian officials and business executives, on his first
visit to Taiwan with a view to cementing bilateral ties and
attracting Taiwan investment. Macedonian business leaders will meet
with their Taiwan counterparts in a seminar on Thursday to discuss
possible trade deals or joint-venture projects.</P>

    <HEADLINE>HOLLAND TRADE OFFICE ASSURES SAFETY OF DUTCH DAIRY PRODUCTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 9 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Netherlands Trade and Investment Office
in Taipei on Wednesday explained to the Department of Health (DOH)
that all dairy products from the Netherlands are safe and clean from
dioxin contamination.</P>
      <P>The Taipei-based Dutch trade officials said veterinarians from
the Netherlands could issue certificates to any concerned individuals
or organizations throughout the world that prove the safety of Dutch
dairy products.</P>
      <P>The Dutch statement came at a time when Taiwan, as well as other
countries, are on alert against farm products, particularly meat,
eggs and dairy products, from Belgium, which shares a common border
with Europe's "dairy kingdom."</P>
      <P>The Belgian dioxin contamination, Europe's worst food scandal
since Britain's "mad cow" crisis in 1996, has led to worldwide
boycotts of Belgian poultry, pork, beef and related products.</P>
      <P>The scare came to light last Friday after it was acknowledged
that some 1,000 Belgian farms have used feed from a contaminated
storage tank.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taiwan's Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture (COA)
narrowed its focus on Taiwan's imports to Belgian animal feed-quality
milk power, which is considered the product with the greatest
likelihood of being contaminated by the dioxin.</P>
      <P>It was found that there is only one company in Taiwan that
imports Belgian milk powder used for feeding calves.</P>
      <P>The COA on Wednesday demanded the Taichung-based importer, which
imported 800,000 metric tons of feed-quality powdered milk from
Belgium last year, to ask for certificates from the Belgian supplier
to prove that the products that have already arrived in Taiwan are
safe and clean from dioxin contamination.</P>
      <P>The importer has sent samples of the Belgian imports to relevant
quarantine agencies for analysis and, in the meantime, has suspended
distribution of the product islandwide.</P>
      <P>Taiwan on Tuesday announced a ban on imports of 77 egg-based,
dairy, poultry and livestock meat products from Belgium, in the wake
of a panic over the dioxin scare.</P>
      <P>The ban also covers products already en route to Taiwan, while
those products that have already arrived at harbors around the island
must pass inspection before being allowed to clear customs.</P>
      <P>Belgium is Taiwan's fifth-largest source of animal feed-quality
milk powder.</P>
      <P>The United States, Singapore, Malaysia and Egypt have enacted
across-the-board bans on meat, egg and dairy products from Belgium,
while Hong Kong and South Korea announced bans on similar products
from Belgium, France and the Netherlands.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFUL CRITICIZES MOVES TO EASE EXPORT CONTROLS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  June 8 (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>US Republican presidential hopeful Gary
Bauer on Tuesday called on President Bill Clinton and members of
Congress not to ease export controls on supercomputers to mainland
China in the wake of the Cox report findings.</P>
      <P>That committee released on May 25 a declassified version of its
investigation report, and one of its major findings was that Beijing
has used supercomputers it purchased from the United States through
steadily relaxed export controls for nuclear weapons research, design
and testing.</P>
      <P>Bauer was responding to recent reports that the Clinton
administration is preparing to further loosen controls on the sale of
supercomputers to mainland China and more than 100 other countries.</P>
      <P>"After the revelations of the Cox report, the American people
want new policies that will ensure their safety, not further erode
it," said the conservative Republican leader. "The move toward easing
export restrictions on supercomputers is exactly the kind of measure
that has helped create the problems the Cox report outlines, and
which endangers America's national security."</P>
      <P>"The Clinton-Gore administration must rethink this unwise and
imprudent proposal, and reverse its present course toward making
access to American technology easier for our adversaries. After what
we have learned about the role of China's acquisition of
supercomputers in enhancing its nuclear arsenal, easing export
restrictions is the last thing our political leadership in the White
House and on Capitol Hill should be doing," he said.</P>
      <P>On May 5, 79 members of the House of Representatives wrote
President Clinton, requesting that he ease export controls on
supercomputers to mainland China and other countries.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EX-TAIWAN GOVERNOR `YET TO DECIDE' WHETHER TO ENTER PRESIDENTIAL RACE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Tokyo, June 9 (CNA)
(By Mike Chang and Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Taiwan Provincial Governor James Soong
on Wednesday said he has yet to decide whether or not to enter the
2000 race for the Republic of China's presidency, but expressed
concern over the direction the election runup is taking.</P>
      <P>Soong made the remarks to reporters covering his visit to Japan.</P>
      <P>A loyal member of the ruling Kuomintang for more than 20 years,
Soong's links with Taiwan's largest political party have soured in
the wake of the KMT-controlled central government's moves to downsize
the Taiwan Provincial Government.</P>
      <P>Soong is widely believed to be preparing for a presidential bid,
and polls show the ex-governor to be a front-runner among the various
presidential aspirants, including Vice President Lien Chan for the
KMT and former Taipei Mayor Chen Shui-bian for the opposition
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>In an earlier interview with Japan's Sankai Shimbun newspaper,
Soong spoke of his opinions of ROC-Japan relations, and stressed that
Taiwan will never give up its democratic system or its determination
to pursue freedom and play a contributory role as a member of the
international community.</P>
      <P>He said ROC President Lee Teng-hui's long-term efforts to defend
Taiwan's dignity and the Taiwan people's interests can only be secure
when there is no military threat to the island.</P>
      <P>Soong is scheduled to deliver a speech on ROC-Japan cooperation
in the maintenance of the regional security on Wednesday evening, and
will deliver another the following day to members of Japan's Upper
House on relations between the two countries in the 21st century.</P>
      <P>Soong arrived in Japan on Tuesday for a five-day private trip to
visit friends, including President Seiichiro Vjiie of the Nippon

      <P>US Sen. Robert C. Smith (R-N.H.) has
introduced a joint resolution opposing the extension of normal trade
relations with mainland China, as recommended by President Bill
Clinton on June 3.</P>
      <P>The joint resolution was read twice Monday and referred to the
Senate Committee on Finance.</P>
      <P>Smith also introduced a resolution on May 26 asking the Senate to
form a select committee to investigate mainland China's spying
activities in the United States. The resolution was introduced one
day after a House committee released a report on Beijing's theft of
US nuclear weapons secrets.</P>
      <P>In addition, Rep. Duncan L. Hunter (R-Calif.) introduced a House
resolution on May 26 to prohibit the export of high-performance
computers to mainland China and several other countries until certain
applicable provisions of the National Defense Authorization Act for
Fiscal Year 1998 are fulfilled.</P>
      <P>Hunter noted that since the secretary of commerce has reported
that mainland China has not allowed post-shipment verifications to be
conducted as required by the National Defense Authorization Act, the
US government does not know if the computers in question are being
used by mainland China for purposes that benefit the military or
attempted weapons proliferation.</P>
      <P>The resolution also requests that the secretary of defense submit
to both House and Senate committees on the armed forces a report on
the impact on US national security of the export of high-performance
computers to countries that have been identified as countries of
concern for national security or proliferation reasons, such as
mainland China, Russia, India, Pakistan and Israel.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREVENTING SUDDEN CARDIAC DEATH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New  York,  June  8 (CNA)
(By David Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A researcher at Washington University's
School of Medicine in St. Louis has invented the first non-invasive
test that identifies people at risk of sudden death caused by
irregular heartbeat.</P>
      <P>The test is called the alternans test because it measures a tiny
fluctuation in heartbeat called the T-wave alternans.</P>
      <P>Doctor Joseph M. Smith, associate professor of medicine and
biomedical engineering, invented the test while he was at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and he hopes it will be used
widely to identify those at risk of sudden death. Cambridge Heart
Inc. developed the test for commercial use, and the Food and Drug
Administration approved it in April 1999.</P>
      <P>Smith and colleagues described their latest study at a meeting of
the North American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology in
Toronto, Canada, in May. They determined how the heartbeat
fluctuation changes as a person's heart rate changes, which will
allow for improvements in the test's accuracy.</P>
      <P>"Because the consequence of a positive alternans test may be
implantation of a defibrillator in some patients, we want to make the
test as accurate as possible," Smith said in an article distributed
by the Washington University Feature Service.</P>
      <P>Most cardiac patients undergo a stress test to evaluate problems
associated with insufficient blood supply to the heart -- a plumbing
problem. Such tests are of little value in detecting the electrical
problems responsible for sudden death, however. Studying the
electrical system of the heart typically requires an invasive test in
which electrode catheters are placed inside the heart.</P>
      <P>While the majority of sudden deaths occur in patients with
plumbing problems, only a small minority of patients with plumbing
problems who also are suspected of having electrical problems go on
to receive the invasive electrical test, according to the article.</P>
      <P>This is due in part to the test's invasive nature, its cost and
the associated risks. "As a result, some people go about their daily
lives without knowing they might suddenly die. In fact, one in three
people who develop fatal arrhythmias have had no previous arrhythmia
symptoms or known heart problems."</P>

    <DATELINE>Canberra,  June  9  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia's productivity growth nearly
doubled between 1994-95 and 1997-98 from previous years, while its
unemployment rate is expected to fall to 7 percent from the current
7.5 percent by the end of this year.</P>
      <P>The Productivity Commission reported on Tuesday that annual
productivity growth of 2.4 percent had been sustained in the past
four years to 1997-98, compared with the long-term average of 1.4
percent in previous years.</P>
      <P>"The acceleration in productivity growth in the 1990s is
outstripping any earlier results," the commission said in a report
released to the media.</P>
      <P>It said recovery from the recession of the early 1990s,
structural reforms, underlying technology advancements and
organizational and management improvements have driven the improved
productivity performance. The acceleration in general has not come
from a reduction in the size of the labor force in this country, it
added.</P>
      <P>The unemployment outlook is expected to improve as companies are
employing more people as a result of strong economic performance,
according to a survey by the Australian Chamber of Commerce and
Industry and Westpac Banking Corp.</P>
      <P>The survey predicts that the jobless rate in Australia will fall
to 7 percent by the end of this year from the current 7.5 percent,
which is a more optimistic forecast than the official target of 7.5
percent unemployment at the end of the year.</P>
      <P>"For the first time since 1994, we have a majority respondents
expecting to increase their workforce," said Westpac's general
manager of economics, Bill Evans. "A lift in employment growth will
be important for sustaining the economy's current momentum for much
longer than generally expected by most commentators," he added.</P>

      <P>Australia has acknowledged publicly for
the first time that Indonesian armed forces were actively supporting
and encouraging pro-integration militia in East Timor, The Australian
reported on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The daily reported that Hugh White, deputy secretary for strategy
and intelligence at the Defense Department, on Tuesday told a Senate
estimates committee of hearing about the active support of the
Indonesian armed forces in East Timor, brushing aside repeated
denials by the Indonesian government. The admission contrasts sharply
with more cautious previous statements by the Australian government.</P>
      <P>"We believe the Indonesian armed forces have been actively
engaged in support and encouraging the pro-integration movements, and
that has contributed significantly to the security problems in East
Timor," White told the Senate.</P>
      <P>The Australian government has been very cautious and unwilling to
confirm directly the numerous reports of Indonesian military support
for the pro-integration forces in East Timor.</P>
      <P>The daily quoted government sources as saying that White's
comments reflected "more up-to-date information."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Monday's general elections in Indonesia were calm and
orderly, and that helped boost the country's stock market, which
surged 12 percent on Monday. It also strengthened the Indonesian

      <P>Vice Finance Minister Yen Ching-chang on
Wednesday dismissed a previous decision by the Ministry of Finance
(MOF) that residents living on offshore islands would receive a
five-year tax exemption, saying the decision was unfair.</P>
      <P>Yen made the statement in response to a report that the MOF,
under the request of several legislators elected from offshore
islands, had agreed to stop levying personal income taxes, business
taxes and business income taxes on offshore island residents.</P>
      <P>In an attempt to speed up construction on the offshore islands,
the MOF on Tuesday had accepted the legislators' proposal that the
ministry not impose the three types of taxes on offshore island
residents for five years.</P>
      <P>The offshore island areas are the Penghu Islands, Kinmen, Matsu,
Green Island and Orchid Island. If the exemptions had gone forward,
it would have been the first time offshore island residents would
have received preferential treatment.</P>

would never have consented to the proposal in the first place, had it
not been pressured by the legislators.</P>

move will benefit Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has gained a better position on the international stage
because of its remarkable performance in political reform and
economic development, Lee said, adding that to secure this position,
Taiwan should make more effort to safeguard its dignity, and should
provide more humanitarian aid from an international viewpoint.</P>

statement at a regular weekly meeting of the KMT Central Standing
Committee.</P>
      <P>Wang Yu-tzeng, a member of KMT Central Standing Committee, as

pledge, even though it has invited criticism at a time when the
government's financial situation is worsening. He also urged KMT
legislators to support the humanitarian aid program.</P>
      <P>Although the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and
Statistics said it has no idea where the funds for the massive amount
of aid will come from, Lee told reporters after the meeting that he
is confident there will be "no problem" financing the fund.</P>
      <P>President Lee told a news conference on Monday that Taiwan will
give US$300 million for the relief and rehabilitation of displaced
Kosovo refugees.</P>
      <P>The proposal came under fierce fire as the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party and the New Party accused Lee of seeking to further
his own political agenda and his Nobel prize ambitions without
considering Taiwan's financial difficulties.</P>
      <P>The two parties suggested that Lee take NT$10 billion out of the
KMT's own coffers, rather than from the pockets of the nation's
taxpayers, if he wants to boost his party's image.</P>

District Court granted custody of the child to his estranged wife.</P>
      <P>McConnell's ex-wife, Chen Ming-ju, originally only applied for a
separation, but when her husband went into hiding, the court granted
her a divorce. Chen, an ethnic Chinese, accused McConnell of having
often beaten her during their marriage.</P>
      <P>Prior to his arrest, McConnell had been working at a computer
company in the Hsinchu industrial park.</P>
      <P>Following the arrest, Chen managed to claim their daughter, now
almost five years old, from a kindergarten in the industrial park.</P>
      <P>Chen came to Taipei earlier this week in the company of two US
police officers after the CIB informed the US Federal Bureau of
Investigation (FBI) that McConnell was living in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The CIB received a request from the FBI two or three months ago
for assistance in locating McConnell, who was believed to have fled
to Taiwan. After extensive investigations, CIB investigators found
that McConnell had taken up residence here, and was working in the
Hsinchu industrial park.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MODELS OF RESTORED LOCOMOTIVE SELL LIKE HOT CAKES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 9 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Every one of 1,000 miniature-scale models of
the first locomotive to see service in Taiwan was sold on Wednesday,
National Railway Day and the 112th anniversary of the inauguration of
the island's first railway line.</P>
      <P>Yang Peng-fei, a 74-year-old retired Taiwan Railway
Administration (TRA) employee who once served as captain of the
112-year-old locomotive, managed to purchase the hand-made model
bearing the serial number 0001, after waiting at the Taipei Railway
Station for two days and nights.</P>
      <P>The model sale coincided with the opening of an exhibition
featuring the recently restored locomotive at the Taipei Railway
Station.</P>
      <P>The steam engine, named Teng-yun or Cloud Rider, was made in
Germany in 1887, purchased by then-Taiwan Governor Liu Ming-chuan,
and began service on the island's first railway line running between
the northern cities of Taipei and Keelung in 1891.</P>
      <P>After 32 years of service, the Teng-yun was decommissioned in
1923 and put on display in the Taipei New Park, which was
recently renamed the 2-28 Peace Park.</P>
      <P>The Teng-yun suffered serious rust damage through years of
exposure to the elements, so in order to preserve this historic
treasure, the TRA in March this year invited retired craftsmen to
help restore the engine to its former glory. The refurbished
locomotive will be exhibited at the Taipei Railway Station for the
next few weeks.</P>
      <P>Yang said the locomotive is of great personal significance to
him. "It is a symbol of my prime years and a witness to the island's
progress over the past decades," he noted, adding that he is very
happy to have been able to purchase the first model of the antique
locomotive.</P>
      <P>The 1,000 models were custom made by KTM, Japan's largest model
train manufacturing company. Each model was sold for NT$35,000 (about
US$1,067). Despite the high price, they were sold out before sunset.
TRA officials said the profits from the sale will be donated to local
charities.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The ninth annual Taipei International Food
Show opened Wednesday at the Taipei World Trade Center, with 478
local and foreign businesses from more than 30 countries
participating.</P>
      <P>Despite the current panic caused by the dioxin contamination of
Belgian livestock and dairy products, this year's show is the largest
ever with over 1,300 booths and eight divisions featuring foodstuff,
beverage equipment, seasoning, add-on substance and barbecue-related
materials.</P>
      <P>There are also national and foreign product sections that
display foods as well as cultural aspects of such countries as
Australia, France, Spain, Germany, Canada, South Korea, New Zealand
and Austria.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is well-represented by a theme section that promotes
high-grade agricultural and fishery products from more than 70
island-wide farmers' associations and fishing groups.</P>
      <P>Chairman Lin Chen-kuo of the sponsoring China External Trade
Development Council (CETRA), and Peng Tso-kwei, chairman of the
Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture (COA), warmly welcomed the
attendees to the opening of the four-day food fair.</P>
      <P>Many first-day visitors were attracted to the exhibition of
"coffee dancing" hosted by Taiwan's five Latin American allies --
Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua -- to
promote their coffee-related products.</P>
      <P>However, Taiwan's recent ban on the importation of 77 livestock-
and dairy-related products from Belgium and the policy to inspect all
Belgian imports already circulating on the island hampered the
festive atmosphere.</P>
      <P>Business representatives from European countries such as Austria,
France, Spain and Germany expressed their opinion that the threat of
contamination from Belgian products is being exaggerated, adding
that most health authorities, including those in Taiwan, are
over-reacting.</P>
      <P>The Europeans stressed the purity of their food exports, with
Gerard Chesnel of the France Institute releasing a statement by the
French government certifying that French dairy exports are not
contaminated by dioxin. The statement said all French products must
pass a strict examination before being exported.</P>
      <P>The Europeans urged relevant authorities here to be more cautious
in dealing with reports of dioxin contamination.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Despite reports from Hong Kong, no Taiwan
residents were victims of the murder that occurred Monday in mainland
China's Guangdong Province, Deputy Secretary General Wu Hsin-hsing of
the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>A Hong Kong-based newspaper, the Oriental Daily News, reported on
Wednesday that the seven people were killed including Taiwanese, a
Chinese-American and Hong Kong residents.</P>
      <P>The murders occurred Monday on the first and second floors of a
residential building located in Fanyu City, southeast of Guangdong
Province's capital city of Guangzhou.</P>
      <P>The five men and two women were reportedly shot separately.
Because the killer(s) only used one bullet to end each victim's life,
mainland Chinese police suspected a professional carried out the
crime.</P>
      <P>The news has caused much concern for the SEF. After asking the
association of Taiwan businessmen in Fanyu City to check, it was
ascertained that no one from Taiwan was among the dead, Wu said.</P>
      <P>Except for one Chinese-American, all the other victims were from
Hong Kong, Australia or mainland China, Wu quoted personnel of the
association as saying.</P>
      <P>It was learned that because the place where the murder occurred
is used as a residence hall by many Taiwanese, Japanese, Hong Kong
Chinese and overseas Chinese, and the place is under special
protection from the police. Despite the protection, criminal elements
have in the past used the building as an underground casino.</P>
      <P>Mainland police speculated that the cause of the murder was
related to a financial dispute or was a pure robbery.</P>

      <P>Foreign Minister Jason Hu Wednesday met with
legislators who expressed dissatisfaction with the government's
decision-making process in pledging US$300 million to aid Kosovar
refugees and have demanded his resignation.</P>
      <P>Hu, who had taken two days off from work due to a cold, still
managed to call on each of the seven Legislative Yuan Foreign and
Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee (FOCAC) members who were present
on Monday when the Kosovar aid was reported.</P>
      <P>Hu invited the seven legislators as well as three other FOCAC
members to the Foreign Ministry Wednesday afternoon for a closed-door
conference to explain the course the government has taken in deciding
the Kosovar aid.</P>
      <P>President Lee Teng-hui announced at a news conference on Monday
that Taiwan will give US$300 million to relieve the suffering and
help rehabilitate Kosovar refugees.</P>
      <P>Before Lee's announcement, Hu had reported the aid pledge to
Legislative Yuan Vice President Yao Eng-chi, FOCAC conveners Wang
Hsueh-fung and Lee Hsian-jen, committee members Hung Chao-nan, Ying
Chi-hung, Chen Hsueh-sheng and Yang Tso-chou, asking for their
opinions.</P>
      <P>However, during Premier Siew's welcoming banquet for Macedonia
Prime Minister Ljubco Georgievski Monday evening, Wang, who is a
member of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party, said Hu told
them the aid package would not exceed US$10 million.</P>
      <P>The amount of US$300 million was never mentioned in the meeting,
Wang said, adding that even the US$10 million was to be paid from the
budget of the International Cooperation and Development Fund.</P>
      <P>Wang said most of the FOCAC members agreed to aid Kosovar
refugees, believing that it was "in the right direction." As for what
the US$10 million can achieve and the reaction of the public, Wang
said these issues remain to be evaluated.</P>
      <P>The amount of aid has to be what Taiwan can afford, she said. If
it turns out to be US$300 million, she would be personally opposed,

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China and Macedonia signed
six agreemetns on Wednesday to strengthen relations between the two
countries.</P>
      <P>ROC Premier Vincent Siew and Macedonian Prime Minister Ljubco
Georgievski signed the agreements on behalf of their respective
governments. Witnessing the signing ceremony were Macedonian Foreign
Minister Aleksandar Dimitrov, ROC Foreign Minister Jason Hu, National
Defense Minister Tang Fei, Finance Minister Paul Chiu, Economics
Minister Wang Chih-kang, as well as other ranking officials from the
two countries.</P>
      <P>The six agreements covered economic development and cooperation,
the protocol on cooperation between the two foreign ministries, a
US$12 million loan provided by ROC's International Cooperation
Development Fund for Macedonia's private sector, the avoidance of
double taxation, customs cooperation and investment guarantees.</P>
      <P>Siew said the agreement on economic development and cooperation
is only the beginning of ROC-Macedonian cooperation, adding that the
ROC is helping to stabilize the Macedonian economy with the hope its
economy is invigorated soon.</P>
      <P>Siew said that he learned that the Macedonian people are friendly,
diligent and well-educated, which he considered to be one of the
biggest assets of the Balkan country.</P>
      <P>The geographic location of Macedonia also provides a suitable
base for Taiwan businessmen wanting to making inroads into Europe,
Siew said.</P>
      <P>The premier said that the ROC is capable and willing to
reciprocate the international community by shouldering its
responsibility as a member of the global village.</P>
      <P>"The ROC is happy to have the respect and friendship of
Macedonia, and is willing to contribute to the rebuilding of
Macedonia and peace in the Balkans," Siew said.</P>
      <P>Georgievski said that he has felt "pleasant" every day since his
arrival on Sunday. He appreciated the ROC for pledging to help
rebuild his country, adding that ROC President Lee Teng-hui's
announcement of an aid package of US$300 million to Kosovar refugees
was a "very humanistic deed."</P>
      <P>He said that since the two countries established diplomatic
relations in Jan. 27, they have had a "fruitful and positive"
engagement, and he expressed his belief that both sides would fulfill
their part of the agreements to lay a solid foundation of friendship.</P>
      <P>Siew and Georgievski held a working lunch Wednesday, during which
both sides promised to push for a rapid implementation of the
agreements and that in the future, both sides will sign a US$2
million stock option investment agreement that covers investment in
Macedonian enterprises.</P>
      <P>In addition to the signing of the six agreements, ROC National
Defense Minister Tang Fei also donated an UH--IH helicopter and the
necessary accessory equipment to help the Macedonia officers patrol
its border.</P>
      <P>Computer producer Umax Data Systems donated 500 computers and 200

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  9  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The head of a Taipei-based petrochemical
giant said on Wednesday that he is soliciting assistance from the
mainland to help permanently dispose of the toxic waste currently
being stored at Kaohsiung Harbor, southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Y. C. Wang, chairman of the Formosa Plastics Group (FPG), said
the mercury-laced waste had passed the review by the appropriate
authorities in the United States, but due to non-professional
factors, the industrial waste was not allowed to leave Taiwan for
transshipment to the US as was originally planned.</P>
      <P>Under the circumstance, Wang said that FPG has had to solicit
assistance from the mainland through other channels.</P>
      <P>But Wang said that a recent report that FPG would soon ship the
waste to Xiamen, Fujian province on the coast of the mainland was
erroneous. Wang said the deal with Xiamen has not been finalized and
that Xiamen is only one of several destinations solicited by FPG.</P>
      <P>Wang also expressed his disappointment over the government's
failure to lending a helping hand to FPG over the waste disposal
issue.</P>
      <P>The controversial waste was first shipped from a FPG plant in
Kaohsiung late last year to the southern coastal town of
Sihanoukville in Cambodia, where it was improperly stored, causing
panic and chaos among the town's residents.</P>
      <P>In early April, FPG apologized to Cambodia for the unrest among
its residents, and shipped the waste in 30 containers back to Taiwan
for temporary storage.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung Harbor authorities allowed the storage of the waste on
the condition that FPG transship it to another country before June 7.
The date has since been extended 60 days.</P>
      <P>Wang also divulged that Xiamen is actively developing
nickel hydrogen and nickel zinc as well as lithium batteries.
Therefore, FPG is considering introducing related technology so that
the Nan Ya Plastic under FPG will be able to produce the
products in Taiwan for the needs of FPG's electric cars, mobile
phones, and notebook computers.</P>
      <P>Wang also revealed that the FPG's affiliated enterprise Chang
Gung Memorial Hospital is interested in cooperating with mainland
hospitals to transfer technology related to Chinese medicine to aid
research and development of similar products in Taiwan.</P>

      <P>Soong arrived in Tokyo on Tuesday at the invitation of the Japan
alumni association of the University of California-Berkeley. Soong is
also an alumnus of the university.</P>
      <P>In the speech given in English, Soong said that Taiwan and Japan
share many common aspects, and, therefore, the two countries should
cooperate to create mutual benefits, especially economic benefits.</P>
      <P>The former Taiwan governor, who intends to run in next spring's
presidential election, said that during his recent tour around
the nation he discovered that nobody in Taiwan wants to live under
communist rule, and that nobody wants to wage a war against mainland
China.</P>
      <P>He said that he believes Taiwan will maintain the existing status
quo, and is ready to engage in constructive dialogue with Beijing
through a gradual formula.</P>
      <P>Taiwan will also fulfill its international and regional
responsibilities commensurate with its economic power and strategic
importance, he added.</P>
      <P>On Thursday, Soong will confer with Lower House member Ichiro
Ozawa, head of the Japan Liberal Party, and attend a
welcoming dinner. On Friday, he will address a symposium on economic
and security affairs.</P>
      <P>A Taipei news report said that the ruling Kuomintang is
considering Soong as the running mate of Vice President Lien Chan,
the front-running KMT presidential candidate.</P>
      <P>When asked to comment on the report, Soong said that he was not
in a position to comment, being abroad and not having a clear
understanding of the report.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's semi-official China External Trade
Development Council (CETRA) is to dispatch specialists to Macedonia
to engage in short-term market research aimed at exploring bilateral
trade and investment opportunities between the two allies.</P>
      <P>CETRA Secretary-General Kao Yi-hsin revealed the plan at a trade
workshop in Taipei, in which 19 Macedonian businesses were introduced
to representatives of more than 100 local companies. The workshop was
intended to inspire mutual trade and cooperation.</P>
      <P>Kao, who returned from a European tour Monday, said that during
his visit to Macedonia, he had not sensed a war-like atmosphere,
although battles were rampant in neighboring Kosovo. Taiwan
businesses may enter the Macedonian market as soon as a cease fire is
signed, Kao said.</P>
      <P>Kao indicated that the eastern European country is suffering from
high prices due to the conflict in Kosovo, but he said Taiwan
investors can benefit by building commodity stores or small
supermarkets there.</P>
      <P>Kao said that in addition to the short-term market research
program, CETRA is also planning to send a senior executive to
Macedonia as a consultant to aid in efforts to promote Taipei-Skopje
trade and investment.</P>
      <P>During the CETRA workshop, Kao recommended that local companies
import from Macedonia textiles, raw materials, electrical appliances,
and alcohol and tobacco products.</P>

    <HEADLINE>3 MAJOR INDONESIAN PARTIES QUESTION ELECTION RESULTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  June  10 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Three of Indonesia's top political
parties are questioning the early results of June 7's elections after
polling less than they had expected, with one even threatening
to set up an alternative government, according to the Australian
Financial Review on Thursday.</P>
      <P>The Review's Asia-Pacific editor Peter Hartcher reported the
ruling Golkar, the PKB or National Awakening Party and PAN or
National Mandate Party, have questioned the early results of the
election.</P>
      <P>Golkar chairman Akbar Tandjung said the PDI-P's lead seemed
excessive and he would ask the Electoral Commission for clarification.
"Our own vote-counting, too, shows PDI-P has obtained more than
Golkar ... but the gap is simply too far," he said. Golkar has so far
won almost 16 percent of the vote.</P>
      <P>PAN chairman Amien Rais has suggested that his party could be the
victim of a conspiracy as the early results showed the Islamic party
got only 6.1 percent of the vote among the major parties.</P>
      <P>PKB leader Abdurranhman Wahid said he was concerned at reports of
vote-rigging and would consider setting up an alternative emergency
government if the suspicions were confirmed. PKB polled more than 22
percent of the vote.</P>
      <P>Only PDI-P's leader Megawati Sukarnoputri has so far not
questioned the results, as the main opposition party received about
40 percent of all votes in the early tally.</P>
      <P>But only three percent of the vote was counted by Wednesday,
raising serious questions about the success of Indonesia's first free
election and democratic experiment, the daily reported.</P>
      <P>International election observers from the US, Europe and
Australia have also voiced their concerns at the slow pace of the
counting in Indonesia's national elections, saying prolonged delays
could arouse suspicions of irregularities in vote tallying across the
country, according to a report by the Australian on Thursday.</P>

(By S. C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>With a Kosovo peace deal in sight, Canada
said Wednesday it will send a team of forensic experts to the area to
gather war crime evidence.</P>
      <P>The team will be made up of eight Royal Canadian Mounted Police
(RCMP) investigators, all experts in crime scene examination.</P>
      <P>RCMP Chief Superintendent Peter Miller said the team will spend
up to four months looking for evidence of alleged atrocities.</P>
      <P>Miller noted the RCMP has experience working on these types of
investigations in places such as Bosnia and Rwanda.</P>
      <P>He admitted one of the problems investigators might encounter is
an attempt by Yugoslav forces to destroy evidence. "This is something
that has happened in the past in other similar areas. It's something
that we'll have to deal with. It's important that our people get in
there once the area has been secured."</P>
      <P>The RCMP team will give its evidence to the international
tribunal investigating war crimes in Yugoslavia. The tribunal will
try to prosecute the people responsible for any atrocities.</P>

    <DATELINE>Canberra,  June  10  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia's gold exports, the third
largest in the world, are shrinking as a result of the continuing
fall of global bullion prices, mainly due to sales by central banks,
according to the Australian Bureau of Agricultural Resources and
Economics (ABARE).</P>
      <P>The ABARE reported gold export revenue in the first quarter of
this year plunged 36 percent to only A$1.2 billion (US$800 million)
from the same period last year.</P>
      <P>ABARE officials attributed the plunge in exports to a dive in
global gold prices ahead of the planned July 6 sale of the first
25-tonne tranche by the British Treasury of its gold reserves.
Altogether Britain is set to sell more than half of its 715 tons of
stockpiled gold.</P>
      <P>Gold price closed at US$262.50 per ounce on Wednesday and are
expected to further drop to between US$240 and US$250 in the months
ahead, market analysts predicted.</P>
      <P>Australia, the world's third largest gold producer, last year
produced about 310 tons. The figure will drop below 300 tons this
year, analysts estimated.</P>

    <DATELINE>Canberra,  June  10  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An Australian scientist has discovered
that milk can repair early tooth decay, the Australian reported on
Thursday.</P>
      <P>The daily reported Professor Eric Reynolds of the School of
Dental Science at Melbourne University has discovered that a peptide
in milk that coats calcium and phosphate on teeth has led to world's
first food additive that can repair early tooth decay.</P>
      <P>The substance -- patented worldwide under the name "Recaldent"
after 15 years of research -- will be added to everything from
mouthwash to chewing gum.</P>
      <P>The daily quoted Reynolds as saying, "We were very pleasantly
surprised -- we actually got better results from the chewing gum in
clinical trials than we got from mouthwash."</P>
      <P>He said scientists have known for decades that milk carries
calcium and phosphate, but they did not apply it to the prevention of
tooth decay.</P>
      <P>"It has been anecdotal and an old wives' tale, but there's really
been no science to substantiate it up until now," he said.
"(Recaldent) is certainly the first product which (by itself) can be
applied to repair teeth," he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT LEE MEETS MACEDONIAN PRIME MINISTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   June  10  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Lee Teng-hui on Thursday
reaffirmed the Republic of China's determination to substantiate
various exchange and cooperative programs with Macedonia.</P>
      <P>Lee made the reaffirmation while meeting with Macedonian Prime
Minister Ljubco Georgievski, who is currently on a six-day official
visit here.</P>
      <P>Noting that Macedonia has good development potential, Lee said
the ROC is more than willing to share its developmental experience
with Macedonia to help the Balkan state revitalize its economy.</P>
      <P>Lee said the ROC has drafted concrete measures to boost
bilateral trade and economic cooperation with Macedonia since the
two countries forged formal diplomatic ties in January this year.</P>
      <P>"We have been waiting for your arrival to discuss some details
concerning those programs," Lee told the Macedonian prime minister,
adding he believes that many exchange and cooperative programs can
into practice after Georgievski's visit.</P>
      <P>Lee went on to say that many Macedonian agricultural products,
including red wine, cotton and tobacco leaves, have great market
potential in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, Lee said, Taiwan has rich experience in
vocational training. "We have many vocational training centers which
can help train skilled workers for Macedonia," he said.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Lee said the ROC is willing to assist Macedonia in
setting up export processing zone and encourage Taiwan businessmen
to invest in Macedonia.</P>
      <P>Lee further said the ROC, as a member of the international
community, will provide US$300 million in aid to Kosovar refugees
and will help them rebuild their war-torn homeland.</P>
      <P>"We believe that our aid program to Kosovo will also benefit
Macedonia because of their geographical proximity," Lee explained.
Macedonia has been troubled by the influx of more than 200,000
ethnic Albanian refugees from the neighboring Yugoslav province of
Kosovo.</P>
      <P>For his part, Georgievski said he originally planned to visit
Taiwan shortly after the two countries established diplomatic
relations. "However, the outbreak of the Kosovo crisis forced me to
postpone my Taiwan visit."</P>
      <P>Georgievski told President Lee that Yugoslavia already signed
a peace agreement with NATO. "I believe that the Balkan region will
soon regain peace and stability."</P>
      <P>The Macedonian prime minister expressed his gratitude for Lee's
concern about the development of cooperative ties between the ROC
and his country. "I earnestly hope that bilateral exchanges and
cooperation in various fields will soon get started."</P>
      <P>Georgievski further said the ROC's US$300 million humanitarian
aid to Kosovars has won worldwide recognition. "We believe that the
ROC's aid package will contribute much to the Balkan's peace and
stability," he added.</P>
      <P>Georgievski told President Lee that the Macedonian Embassy in
Taipei already became operational on Wednesday to facilitate
bilateral exchanges and cooperation.</P>
      <P>The 33-year-old Macedonian prime minister, heading a 59-member
delegation of senior officials and business executives, arrived in
Taipei on Sunday for his first visit to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Georgievski signed six agreements with ROC Premier Vincent Siew
on Wednesday to reinforce bilateral trade, investment and
cooperation in various fields.</P>
      <P>Georgievski personally chaired a seminar on Tuesday to attract
Taiwan investors. And another trade seminar was held on Thursday,
with the participation of Macedonian entrepreneurs and their Taiwan
counterparts.</P>
      <P>Senior executives from more than 100 Taiwan companies in
banking services, computer, textile, food processing, insurance
and shoemaking industries took part in Thursday's forum to explore
possible trade deals or joint-venture projects.</P>
      <P>As Macedonia can serve as a springboard to tap the vast
European market, many Taiwan entrepreneurs have shown keen interest
in setting up footholds or launching investment projects there.</P>

Tainan, his hometown. He rated higher than other presidential
hopefuls in terms of his resolve to carry out reforms and his
ability.</P>
      <P>But his lead over another presidential hopeful, James Soong, was
not very large, while Vice President Lien Chan received positive
marks for his perceived ability to maintain national security and
stability.</P>
      <P>In a two-way election between the ruling Kuomintang and the
opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), the DPP's Chen would
receive 53.6 percent of the vote, while the KMT's Lien would receive
23.4 percent.</P>
      <P>But if former Taiwan Provincial Governor James Soong breaks ranks
with the KMT and runs independently, Chen would capture only 34.7
percent of the vote, while Soong would receive 30.2 percent and Lien,
12.2 percent.</P>
      <P>If former DPP Chairman Hsu Hsin-liang throws down the gauntlet
and enters the race, the numbers would change considerably.</P>
      <P>Support for Soong would drop to 24.1 percent, while Chen's
support would increase to 39.5 percent, and Lien's would rise to 14.2
percent, suggesting Tainan voters would close ranks behind Chen.</P>
      <P>Some 83.1 percent of the polled said that they would not be
influenced by President Lee Teng-hui's campaigning for Lien. Two
percent said they would be influenced and 6.7 percent said they might
be.</P>
      <P>As for the personal traits of the four presidential hopefuls,
Chen led Soong 29.2 percent to 28.9 percent in terms of worthiness of
the public trust. On that point, 12.7 percent of respondents
supported Lien and 1 percent supported Hsu.</P>
      <P>On the question of who would be most resolute in carrying out
reforms and who is most capable of doing the job, Chen received
support from 48.8 percent of respondents, while support for Soong,
Lien and Hsu was at 12.4 percent, 7.1 percent and 1.2 percent,
respectively.</P>
      <P>On the issue of national stability and security, Tainan voters
are more in favor of Lien, who received support from 24.5 percent of
respondents, while Chen received support from 17 percent; Soong, 16
percent; and Hsu, 0.3 percent.</P>
      <P>Tainan County Magistrate Chen Tang-shan, in assessing the survey,
said that it is not surprising that Chen received a high percentage
of support in his hometown.</P>
      <P>Professor Lin Chia-lung of National Chung Cheng University said
that Tainan County is the fifth city or county that has conducted
such a survey.</P>
      <P>Lin said that in addition to being the hometown candidate, Chen's
strong showing stems from the fact that Tainan county has
traditionally identified with the DPP.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted June 3-4, with 1,031 effective samples,
and it had a margin of error of 3.05 percent.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  10  (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Concerned about the dioxin-contaminated
Belgian dairy products, Premier Vincent Siew on Thursday instructed
authorities to map out efficient measure to protect local consumers.</P>
      <P>Siew issued the order after hearing briefings from Economics
Minister Wang Chih-kang and Deputy Director-General Chang Hung-jen of
the Department of Health.</P>
      <P>Chang's report indicated that the department has confirmed that
Belgian meat, egg-based products and dairy products are suspected of
being contaminated. Of those products, however, Taiwan imports only
dairy items from Belgium, Chang said.</P>
      <P>Stores and supermarkets around the island have been instructed to
remove from their shelves products suspected of being contaminated,
and certification experts at National Tsinghua University have been
mobilized to analyze the products.</P>
      <P>Wang reported that his ministry is convening a supra-governmental
meeting Thursday afternoon, in which farm, trade, health and
quarantine officials will discuss whether to expand bans on Belgian
imports.</P>
      <P>Vice Economics Minister Lin Yi-fu told reporters that the ban may
be expanded to include Belgian chocolates, cakes, cookies, powdered
infant milk formula and other food items, in addition to the 77 food
types -- ranging from egg-based and dairy goods to animal fat and
feed -- already on the list.</P>
      <P>More than 20 types of food from Belgium could be added to the
list, Lin said.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the ban would be expanded to include products from
other European countries, Lin answered that restrictions would be
based only on scientific evidence of signs of toxic contamination.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan ban came soon after a decision by European leaders to
destroy chicken- and egg-based foodstuffs originating from Belgium.
The crackdown was spurred by the discovery that 400 poultry farms
around Belgium may have used dioxin-contaminated feed.</P>
      <P>Belgium has said that the contaminated feed may have gone to 500
pig breeders, while Belgian cattle are now being tested as well.</P>
      <P>So far, the United States has restricted all imports of poultry
products and pork from European countries, while members of the
European Union have banned imports of Belgian chickens, eggs, pork
and beef. Singapore has banned imports of all kinds of poultry and
livestock products from European countries, according to an official

    <HEADLINE>EX-TAIWAN GOVERNOR MEETS FORMER JAPANESE PRIME MINISTERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Tokyo,  June 10 (CNA)
(By Mike Chang and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Two former Japanese prime ministers Tsutomu
Hata and Toshiki Kaifu paid visits to former Taiwan Governor James
Soong at his hotel on Thursday for wide-ranging talks.</P>
      <P>As Soong has consistently topped other presidential hopefuls in
Taiwan's public opinion polls, his current visit has drawn much
attention in the Japanese political and journalistic communities.</P>
      <P>The unprecedented moves by two Japanese former prime ministers
to meet Soong at his hotel indicate that the Japanese political
community is very concerned or curious who will be Taiwan's next
president.</P>
      <P>Soong said after his one-hour talks with Hata that they have
exchanged views on a number of issues concerning relations between
Taiwan and Japan.</P>
      <P>Soong said he has briefed Hata on Taiwan's determination to
continue promoting economic reform and political democratization
as well as further reinforcing exchanges with Japan.</P>
      <P>"For his part, Hata expressed his views on the current
situation and future development directions in Japan and the entire
East Asia," Soong said.</P>
      <P>Soong said he has told Hata that Taiwan and Japan should work
closely to push mainland China to move toward democracy and peaceful
evolution in order to maintain regional stability and prosperity.</P>
      <P>This was the first meeting between Soong and Hata, who is now
secretary-general of Japan's largest opposition Democratic Party.</P>
      <P>Around noon, former Japanese Prime Minister Kaifu arrived at the
Prince Hotel in downtown Tokyo where Soong is staying.</P>
      <P>Kaifu, who is now the top adviser to the Liberal Party, told a
group of Taiwan journalists that he has not had any contact with
Taiwan's political figures since he became Japanese prime minister
in the late 1980s.</P>
      <P>"This is my first encounter with Soong," Kaifu said, adding that
he would exchange views with Soong on matters of mutual concern.</P>
      <P>Soong, Kaifu and several of their friends lunched together at
the hotel.</P>
      <P>In the afternoon, Soong also met with Ichiro Ozawa, chairman
of the Liberal Party, which forms a ruling coalition with the
largest Liberal Democratic Party.</P>
      <P>Soong attended a welcoming party in the evening, which brought
together with some 60 influential figures in four major Japanese
parties and elite members in the business and academic communities.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Sankei Shimbun published an interview with Soong
on Thursday, in which Soong showed an active attitude toward joining
Taiwan's next presidential election, scheduled for March 2000.</P>
      <P>Soong said in the interview, conducted in Tokyo on Wednesday,
that he will make a final decision at an appropriate on whether he
will run in next year's presidential election. "Public expectations
will be my top concern in mulling the issue," he added.</P>
      <P>Asked if he is likely to serve as Vice President Lien Chan's
running mate, Soong said public opinion polls show that it is
already too late to consider the possibility of a Lien-Soong
presidential ticket.</P>
      <P>At the moment, Soong said he has no intention to break ranks
with the ruling Kuomintang to run in the presidential election as an
independent.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Soong said he earnestly hopes that the KMT will
nominate the person most favored by the general public as its
standard bearer.</P>
      <P>Soong told the major Japanese economic daily that the core
purposes of his current Japan visit are to exchange views with
Japanese politicians on the promotion of cooperation between the two
countries and to listen to their opinions about Taiwan-Japan
relations.</P>
      <P>Asked what will be his top priority if he is elected president,
Soong said improving relations with mainland China, revitalizing the
economy, reinforcing the democratic system and reducing the crime
rate will be his priority agenda.</P>
      <P>Touching on speculation about his rift with ROC President and
KMT Chairman Lee Teng-hui, Soong said Lee has made outstanding
contributions to the Republic of China on Taiwan, particularly in
democratic reforms. Soong further said he shares same views with Lee
on many issues related to Taiwan-mainland China relations.</P>
      <P>Soong arrived in Tokyo on Tuesday for a five-day visit,
following his trips to the Philippines and the United States.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN MULLS INTRODUCING CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICAN WORKERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  10  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Chairman Kao Chin-yen of the Chinese
National Federation of Industries said on Wednesday that the Council
of Labor Affairs (CLA) and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) are
pondering the feasibility of introducing labor from Taiwan's Central
and South American allies.</P>
      <P>Kao Chin-yen, who is also the CEO of the President Group, said
during a conference attended by CLA chairman Chan Hou-sheng and the
heads of various industry groups, that the policy would be
implemented for diplomatic reasons.</P>
      <P>Chan confirmed that allied countries' labor might be introduced,
but stressed that the overall number of foreign laborers in Taiwan,
including current workers from Thailand, the Philippines, Indonesia,
Vietnam would out surpass 270,000.</P>
      <P>During the conference, the issue of insufficient domestic labor
was raised again. Industrial leaders requested that workers from the
Central and South America be excluded from the limit of 270,000 in
order to meet current industrial demand.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chan, in facing strong complaints from industrialists
over insufficient workers, said the CLA will not reduce the foreign
labor quota assigned to the "3K industry", if the CLA finds a labor
problem exists.</P>
      <P>Chan's remarks overturned his previous stance calling for a
reduction of the construction and manufacturing industries quota by
10 percent annually.</P>
      <P>The "3K industry" refers to jobs that are exhausted, out of
hardship or danger, with the working environment unpleasant and
dirty.</P>
      <P>Wen the labor shortage problem continues, the unemployment
declines, the CLA, with the support of the general public,
will
distribute foreign labor quota to industries that in the past
were not allowed to hire foreign laborers, Chan added.</P>
      <P>Chan also backed the federation's viewpoint that foreign laborers
should not become the scapegoats of unemployed aboriginal people.</P>
      <P>Foreign labor policy is often a target of politicians who use it
as an excuse to oppose introducing foreign workers, Chan added.

    <HEADLINE>NEW PARTY MARCH IN PROTEST OVER KOSOVAR AID PLEDGE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 10 (CNA)
(By Wendy Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Hundreds of wrought-up opposition New Party
(NP) members and supporters Thursday marched to the Presidential
Office in protest over President Lee Teng-hui's aid pledge to Kosovo,
with the march ending in a slight skirmish with police.</P>
      <P>In protest over President Lee's announcement on Monday of a
US$300 million (approximately NT$100 billion) aid package to Kosovar
refugees, around 400 NP supporters, led by more than 20 NP
legislators, National Assembly (NA) deputies and Taipei City
councilors, marched toward the Presidential Office Thursday morning.</P>
      <P>Protesters chanted "March towards the Presidential Office;
salvage NT$100 billion; redress injustice of small citizens" during
their march.</P>
      <P>NP Legislative Yuan Caucus Convener Lee Ching-hua; Legislators
Cheng Lung-shui, Ying Chi-hung and Lai Shi-pao; NA Convener Chin
Chi-hua; and Taipei City Council Vice Convener Wei Yi-lung said they
were not opposed to aiding Kosovar refugees.</P>
      <P>But they object to the amount of the proposed aid package and the
means by which the decision to offer the aid was made, they said.</P>
      <P>They said that with the worsening of Taiwan's economy, numerous
underprivileged people are in dire need of government help, but Lee
has ignored the legal system and announced the massive aid package to
aid Kosovo, which is not an ally of the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>The NP urged Lee not to conduct "checkbook diplomacy" and asked
Lee to spread his charity among his own people before helping others.</P>
      <P>The military police had set up blockades in front of the
Presidential Office before the protesters arrived. It was decided
that the NP could send one legislator, eight NA deputies and one
Taipei City councilor into the building to hand in their protest
letter.</P>
      <P>But a slight skirmish erupted after military police refused to
remove the blockades and let the representatives enter through the
front entrance.</P>
      <P>In the end, Director-General Fann-Jiang Chun-sheng of the
Department of Public Affairs came out to receive the 10 NP members,
as their demand to see the presidential secretary-general or deputy
secretary-general went unanswered.</P>
      <P>Since the protest group was unable to meet with Lee, the
representatives read aloud their protest letter in the Presidential
Office, asking Lee to understand "what the people wants" and not to
"do whatever he wants."</P>
      <P>The NP also demanded that the amount of the Kosovar aid be
reduced to NT$300 million and that the procedure used to determine
whether the aid should be offered be explained to the public.</P>
      <P>NP National Assembly Vice Convener Huang Hung-chun said that, as
the 10 representatives were all the people's representatives, it was
unacceptable that the military police should prevent the "guests"
from seeing the president.</P>
      <P>The NP has decided that Lee will be given the same treatment when
he attends the National Assembly for his national conditions report,
Huang said.</P>
      <P>In addition to the morning's protest, the NP has made a motion
requesting Premier Vincent Siew report at the Legislative Yuan next
Tuesday. The party has also made a motion to counterbalance the
president's power through constitutional amendment.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of National Defense (MND) said
on Thursday that frequent US military overflights pose no threat to
Taiwan's national security.</P>
      <P>The ministry was responding to criticism by Legislator Chen
Hsueh-sheng (KMT-Taipei) that US military aircraft fly through the
Republic of China's airspace too often.</P>
      <P>Chen said at a news conference that US military aircraft flew
through Taiwan's airspace a total of 112 times between 1998 and April
1999.</P>
      <P>"This is a record rarely seen elsewhere in the world," Chen
claimed, adding he does not think that the frequent US military
overflights are all really "innocent passages."</P>
      <P>Chen demanded that the MND give an immediate explanation of the
issue.</P>
      <P>In response, the MND said US military authorities usually apply
beforehand when their aircraft want to fly through Taiwan's flight
information zone, applying through the Coordination Council for North
American Affairs, a semi-official body founded by the ROC to handle
exchanges with the United States in the absence of official ties.</P>
      <P>After receiving the application, the MND inspects the flight
route and time. "MND inspections show that US military aircraft have
consistently flown through our airspace via international flight
routes," said a ministry official.</P>
      <P>According to international regulations, the official said, the
ROC is obligated to provide necessary flight services and controls.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the official said, US military overflights are mainly
for personnel transport. "Their missions pose no threat to our
national security," the official stressed, adding that in view of
longstanding cordial relations between Taiwan and the United States,
the MND has no reason to reject US overflight applications.</P>

      <P>A private Taiwan firm established to boost
local investment in Central America will funnel US$10 billion into
the region over the next seven years, and not the Republic of China
government, an ROC diplomat said on Thursday.</P>
      <P>In a report to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA), Timothy
Tsen, the economic adviser to the ROC embassy in Costa Rica, said
that Taiwan's media had got their facts wrong when they reported on
his remarks published on June 4 by Costa Rica's La Republica daily.</P>
      <P>Tsen said he told the Costa Rica media at a press briefing at an
ROC trade show in Costa Rica's capital of San Jose that the
Taipei-based Central American Investment Holding Company (CAIHC) had
come up with a plan, dubbed "El Tucan" (toucan), to funnel US$10
billion over the next seven years into the states of the region,

    <HEADLINE>FOOT-AND-MOUTH DISEASE BREAKS OUT AMONG KINMEN CATTLE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  10  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The island of Kinmen was declared a
foot-and-mouth disease (FMD)-infected area after two cattle there
were diagnosed with the disease, the Republic of China Council of
Agriculture (COA) said on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Kinmen, a fortress island 2.3 km from mainland China's Fujian
Province, is weighing the option of slaughtering all of its 3,000
head of cattle, COA officials said.</P>
      <P>The two cases of FMD are the first in five decades on the island,
which has not imported any cattle from abroad since 1945.</P>
      <P>Four veterinarians from the COA immediately set off for the
frontline island carrying 6,000 vials of vaccine, the officials said.</P>
      <P>A ban on exports of the island's livestock produce was imposed on
Thursday evening as soon as the FMD diagnosis was confirmed.</P>
      <P>FMD is an acute contagious disease of cloven-hoofed animals which
is caused by various rhinoviruses. It ravaged Taiwan's swine
population in 1997, crippled the island's booming pig farming
industry and totally wiping out its port exports.</P>
      <P>The disease flared up again among pigs on the offshore island of
Penghu and in southern Taiwan earlier this year, but no cattle were
reported to have been affected.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US REPUBLICAN PARTY WHIP TOUTS TAIWAN SECURITY ENHANCEMENT ACT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  June  9 (CNA)
(By Jay Chen &amp; Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Tom DeLay, the Republican Party's whip
in the US House of Representatives, has sent letters to his
colleagues, seeking their support for the Taiwan Security Enhancement
Act.</P>
      <P>The act was jointly introduced by DeLay, House International
Relations Committee Chairman Ben Gilman, and other House members, in
May this year.</P>
      <P>The bill has three main thrusts:</P>
      <P>-- Ensuring that Taiwan has the necessary equipment to maintain
its self-defense capabilities, as promised under the Taiwan Relations
Act (TRA), by authorizing the sale to Taiwan of a broad array of
equipment and defensive weapons;</P>
      <P>-- Bolstering the process for such defense sales to Taiwan by
prohibiting politically motivated reductions in US arms sales,
requiring an increase in staffing at the American Institute in
Taiwan, and requiring an annual presidential report to Congress on
Taiwan's defense needs; and</P>
      <P>-- Redressing deficiencies in Taiwan's combat readiness by
supporting increased Taiwan enrollment at US military colleges,
expanded military exchanges and joint training, and establishing
direct communications between the two countries' militaries.</P>
      <P>DeLay said in his letter, dated June 7, that "the threat to the
Taiwanese people from the People's Republic of China is on the rise,"
adding that one lever Beijing uses in pursuit of its goal to reunify
Taiwan is "intimidation."</P>
      <P>He quoted a Pentagon report as saying that the PRC is engaged in
a major buildup of ballistic missiles on its coast directly across
the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Other military buildups were also described in the report,
coupled with increased efforts to improve mainland China's logistical
capabilities for a Taiwan invasion scenario, he said.</P>
      <P>In order to maintain a balance of power in the region, DeLay
noted, the US should ignore Beijing's pressure on the US to limit or
cease its arms sales to Taiwan, and should remain steadfast by
continuing to provide Taiwan with the means to maintain a sufficient
self-defense capability.</P>
      <P>According to reliable sources, as of June 8, 17 congressmen have
co-sponsored the Taiwan Security Enhancement Act. A similar bill
introduced in the Senate in March has received support from seven
senators.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Beijing has adopted a two-pronged policy
to ensure that national security is in line with its perception of an
enhanced anti-China containment policy by the West, The South China
Morning Post reported Thursday.</P>
      <P>Mainland authorities are also committed to maintaining the
"multi-polar" nature of the world order -- in other words, putting
limits on the powers of the United States, said the report.</P>
      <P>After the bombing of the mainland Chinese Embassy in Belgrade,
President Jiang Zemin has held marathon sessions with advisers from
areas including diplomacy, defense and foreign trade.</P>
      <P>According to the report, one recommendation is that mainland
China seek to ensure peace and good neighborliness along its borders.</P>
      <P>The past few weeks have seen dozens of meetings between mainland
Chinese officials and their counterparts from neighboring states.
The latter range from regional powers such as Russia and Pakistan to
small countries including North Korea, Nepal, Laos, Burma, as well as
former Soviet countries bordering Xinjiang.</P>
      <P>Several visiting delegations, including those from Russia,
Pakistan and Laos, were led by military officers. People's Liberation
Army generals have been active on foreign trips or meeting civilian
foreign dignitaries in Beijing, the report noted.</P>
      <P>The report quoted diplomatic analysts as saying that the military
component of the talks suggested Beijing particularly wanted to avoid
conflicts close to home.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KINMEN BEEF, CATTLE BARRED FROM ENTERING TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kinmen,  June 11 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Two oxen on a Kinmen range were identified
Friday as being infected with foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), the first
report of the deadly disease on the offshore island in 70 years.</P>
      <P>The identification prompted quarantine officials from Taiwan to
slaughter all 45 head of cattle on the Hsin Yao Chi Range to
eliminate the highly contagious disease.</P>
      <P>Four officials representing the Cabinet-level Council of
Agriculture (COA), the Pig Research Institute in Taipei and the
Taiwan Research Institute for Animal Health, flew to Kinmen Friday
morning to investigate the epidemic on the island, which is located
close to mainland China's coastal Fujian province.</P>
      <P>After analyzing virus samples obtained from the two affected
oxen, the officials were certain that the disease was not identical
to the one found in FMD-stricken hogs in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The finding led the officials to believe that the FMD strain
affecting Kinmen cattle originated in mainland China.</P>
      <P>According to Yang Shui-sen, director of the Kinmen Livestock
Research Institute, the cattle will be anesthetized, then
electrocuted, and their bodies will be buried in Kinmen.</P>
      <P>The FMD report has also led the COA to announce that live cattle
and all fresh, unprocessed meat of cloven-hoofed animals from Kinmen
will be barred from entering Taiwan starting Friday.</P>
      <P>Kinmen air and sea passengers, as well as cargoes bound for
Taiwan, were also strictly scrutinized before boarding transport
carriers.</P>
      <P>Officials from the Kinmen County Government blamed the possible
outbreak on a reduction in the number of armed forces personnel
posted on the former front-line anti-communist bastion. Fewer
personnel has resulted in lagging security around Kinmen and
increased smuggling from mainland China, they noted.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, all 3,000 head of cattle and 2,000 head of goats
around Kinmen that are not affected by the disease will receive FMD
vaccine injections in the coming days to stem the spread of the
deadly disease.</P>
      <P>COA officials said they are not particularly worried about the
possibility that some of the 700,000 head of cattle in Taiwan may
become infected by the Kinmen FMD strain. Some 295 head of Kinmen
cattle were shipped to Taiwan between January and May this year, and
all were delivered to slaughterhouses in Tainan County and Panchiao,
Taipei County.</P>
      <P>Officials said they are concerned, however, that cattle from
mainland China may have been smuggled into Taiwan through Kinmen,
creating a "black hole" that cannot be monitored.</P>
      <P>In the months before May this year, FMD epidemics were widely
reported in mainland China. The disease has reportedly affected not
only pigs but other cloven-hoofed animals, including cattle, sheep,
goats and even camels, said COA officials.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Canada's economy grew by a solid one
percent (1.0%) in the first quarter of this year as consumer spending
boosted the domestic economy and a booming U.S. economy led to a
surge in exports, Statistics Canada (StatsCan) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>At an annualized rate, real gross domestic product (GDP) grew by
a robust 4.2 percent (4.2%) in the first three months of 1999, down
from the fourth quarter's very strong 4.8 percent GDP growth.</P>
      <P>StatsCan said consumer spending, showing renewed strength after
two flat quarters, rose 1.3 percent in the quarter, with gains
throughout a number of categories.</P>
      <P>"Stable interest rates and recent employment gains boosted
consumer confidence in the quarter. Growth picked up speed in
virtually all categories of personal expenditure, with durable goods,
notably new motor vehicles, leading the increase," said the federal
agency in a press release.</P>
      <P>The continuing strength of the U.S. economy continued to benefit
Canada as exports increased by 2.1 percent in the quarter. Advances
in exports of autos, machinery and equipment offset declines in
agricultural and energy exports.</P>
      <P>The housing market also heated up, particularly in Ontario and
the Atlantic region. British Columbia also showed improvement after a
series of quarterly declines.</P>
      <P>Business investment in residential construction, machinery and
equipment was also up, the government tallies show.</P>

      <P>The Republic of China is expected to
continue to have substantial, friendly relations with South Africa
after Thabo Mbeki succeeds Nelson Mandela as the leader of South
Africa, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said on Friday.</P>
      <P>MOFA officials noted that South Africa completed its presidential
election earlier this month, and Mbeki, leader of the African
National Congress (ANC), is expected to become president.</P>
      <P>They noted that South Africa is the largest trade partner of the
Republic of China in Africa and that they expected the ROC to
continue to have substantial, friendly relations with South Africa
under Mbeki.</P>
      <P>The officials said that the ruling ANC garnered 66.35 percent of
the vote to win 266 seats in the Parliament, one seat shy of an
absolute majority.</P>
      <P>Wire reports said that the Minority Front, which won one seat in
Parliament and is popular among the descendants of Indian immigrants,
has allied itself with the ANC.</P>
      <P>They noted that the support rate for the ANC this year is higher
than the 62.5 percent support rate seen in the last election in 1994.
The ANC will direct its efforts toward constitutional reforms, more
jobs, lowering the crime rate and upgrading South Africa's
educational system over the next five years under Mbeki.</P>
      <P>The election is also significant in the sense that it marks the
arrival of the era of Mbeki, who will face daunting challenges in
fighting crime and poverty, as he vowed to do while campaigning.</P>

      <P>The United States, Japan, Korea,
Taiwan, and the European Union signed on Thursday a new,
multilateral Joint Statement on semiconductors designed to ensure
fair and open global trading in the chips industry.</P>
      <P>The Joint Statement follows the 1996 bilateral US-Japan Joint
Statement on Semiconductors which expires July 31, 1999. The new
accord includes the essential elements of the 1996 accord.</P>
      <P>The five largest semiconductor-producing countries have basically
agreed to several competitive provisions, including a commitment to
create barrier-free trade in semiconductors in worldwide markets.</P>
      <P>In the Joint Statement, the parties also recognized that the GATT
Agreement of 1994 condemns injurious dumping, and reaffirmed the need
to avoid the problem of dumping by taking fair and effective
anti-dumping measures consistent with GATT and WTO agreements .</P>
      <P>"Under the new Joint Statement, industry CEOs will continue to
meet at the World Semiconductor Council (WSC) to discuss and engage

      <P>Chip industry sales have declined for the past three years,

    <HEADLINE>AUSTRALIA  PLANS  TO  SUE  JAPAN OVER TUNA FISHING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  June  11 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia plans to sue Japan for over- 
harvesting the dwindling bluefin tuna stocks.</P>
      <P>Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry Minister Mark Vaile told
reporters that the Japanese government had "disregarded" Australia's
earlier protest against its decision, saying several Japanese
long-liners were already in the Southern Ocean, not far from
Australia's fishing zone.</P>
      <P>"The government has decided to act decisively. We are now
examining our legal options to ensure that we pursue the most
effective course," he told reporters.</P>
      <P>The southern bluefin tuna is one of the world's most valuable
fish species, capable of yielding up to US$60,000 each at Tokyo's
fish market.</P>
      <P>Under an agreement signed in 1989, the annual cap on bluefin tuna
is limited to 11,750 tons a year. Japanese fishing fleets are
permitted to catch 52 percent of the total figure with Australian
fleets accounting for 45 percent and New Zealand vessels making up the
rest.</P>
      <P>But Japan flouted the cap last year, harvesting 1,400 tons of
tuna above its quota and this week confirmed it planned to do the
same again this year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EX-TAIWAN GOVERNOR MEETS LDP HEAVYWEIGHT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Tokyo,  June 11 (CNA)
(By Mike Chang and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Taiwan Governor James Soong met with
Koichi Kato, head of the second largest faction in Japan's long
dominating Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), on Friday for
wide-ranging talks.</P>
      <P>The closed-door meeting was held at Kato's office, but neither
of them would divulge the content of their hour-long talks. Kato
once served as the LDP secretary-general and director of the
Self-Defense Agency. He plans to run for the LDP leadership in
September.</P>
      <P>Soong lunched together with several Japanese members of the
House of Representatives from the Liberal Party. And then he
delivered a speech at a House of Councilors conference hall at the
invitation of the Economic Security Research Association.</P>
      <P>Soong said in his speech, titled the Asia-Pacific Security
Strategy and Taiwan's Responsibility, that Taiwan is located at a
critical point on Japan's lifeline.</P>
      <P>Therefore, Soong said, Taiwan's stability, prosperity, freedom
and democracy are crucial to peace in the Asia-Pacific region and
deserve Japan's concern and respect.</P>
      <P>Soong said Taiwan is pleased to see the signing of the new
Japan-US Defense Cooperation Guidelines which he said provides a new
mechanism to maintain regional security in the post-Cold War era.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that there are four "leading players" in the
Asia-Pacific -- the United States, Japan, Taiwan and mainland China.
"Each of them is obligated to help maintain peace and stability in
the region," Soong said, adding that Taiwan should act like a buffer
to reduce the risk of conflicts in the region.</P>
      <P>Soong said Taiwan should avoid taking any irrational actions to
provoke mainland China and thus force the United States and Japan to
make difficult, painful choices.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, Soong called on mainland China not to
underestimate Taiwan people's determination to safeguard their highly
cherished democratic system and liberal lifestyle.</P>
      <P>"Mainland China should also never overlook the general
Taiwan public's strong will-power to resist pressure," Soong said.</P>
      <P>Quoting President Lee Teng-hui's views unveiled in his new book
"With the People Always in My Heart," Soong said the
well-being of all Chinese people must be the priority concern in
mulling China's reunification.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Soong said China can be reunified only under the
principles of freedom, democracy and equitable distribution of
wealth.</P>
      <P>Touching on relations across the Taiwan Strait, Soong said
Taiwan and mainland China should establish a comprehensive framework
for regular dialogue to maintain cross-strait peace.</P>
      <P>Noting that cross-strait political talks are the inevitable,
Soong said Taiwan and mainland China should establish a three-stage
consultation formula which calls for fostering consensus, seeking
agreement and approval of the general Taiwan public.</P>
      <P>About 90 Japanese politicians, media and business executives,
and academics, as well as overseas Chinese community leaders,
including five Japanese councilors, attended Soong's speech.</P>
      <P>Soong arrived in Tokyo on Tuesday for a five-day visit aimed
at upgrading his international profile as he is likely to run in
Taiwan's next presidential election scheduled for 2000. He already
visited the Philippines and the United States before coming to
Japan.</P>

Korea, Taiwan and the European Union (EU) announced on Thursday the
establishment of a new semiconductor organization, the World
Semiconductor Council.</P>
      <P>The council, sponsored by the European Commission, the EU's

as a new member.</P>
      <P>After the conference, a joint statement was issued, saying the
council was designed to ensure fair and open global trade in
semiconductors. It will seek zero tariffs for the industry and will
urge governments to make policies based on World Trade Organization
standards.</P>
      <P>This mechanism, meant to replace the 1996 US-Japan Joint
Statement on Semiconductors, due to expire July 31, 1999, led to an

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Another batch of Taiwan business people
were reportedly fined heavily by mainland Chinese authorities for
traveling in mainland China without having "taipaozheng's" -- the
official travel document for people from Taiwan visiting mainland
China, travel industry sources said on Friday.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan business people were recently found to be visiting the
southern mainland Chinese city of Xiamen. Instead of carrying
taipaozheng's, they had travel documents that were issued by mainland
Chinese authorities for overseas Chinese visiting mainland China.</P>
      <P>Taiwan businessmen and travelers previously found to be traveling
in mainland China with travel documents inappropriate for people from
Taiwan were fined 5,000 renminbi each and had their travel documents
confiscated, said officials from the Taipei Association of Travel
Agents (TATA).</P>
      <P>It was learned that the Taiwan residents obtained their travel
documents from a few overseas Chinese who moonlighted as travel
agency brokers between Taiwan and mainland China and who provided the
documents at a cost of NT$10,000 each. Reports said the travel
documents were sought after by the Taiwanese because it saves them
the trouble of trying to obtain multiple-entry visas for visits to
the mainland for a variety of purposes.</P>
      <P>Mainland Chinese immigration authorities reportedly acknowledged
that the practice of providing inappropriate entry documents has been
occurring and launched a crackdown.</P>
      <P>Although TATA officials said the taipaozheng requirement is
discriminatory against people from Taiwan, they urged all Taiwan
people about to visit mainland China to be realistic and to apply for
a taipaozheng before heading to the mainland.</P>

      <P>Four US legislators on Thursday lauded
Taiwan's decision to financially aid Kosovar refugees, saying that
the move underlines Taiwan's commitment to playing a "helper's role"

      <P>Senator Max Cleland (D-Ga.) and Representatives Solomon Ortiz

Thursday spoke individually on the Senate and House floors to praise
the goodwill shown by the Republic of China in offering the US$300
million aid package.</P>
      <P>The package, unveiled Monday, includes emergency supplies for
Kosovar refugees and contributions to long-term reconstruction
efforts by the international community in Kosovo once a peace plan is
accepted. Moreover, it also offers to provide Kosovar refugees with
short-term technical training in Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING ADVISED TO FORSWEAR USE OF FORCE AGAINST TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra, June 11 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A former foreign policy speech writer for
US President Bill Clinton said mainland China should take note of the
United States' war record and forswear the use of force against
Taiwan, if it wants to reunite the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>In an article published in The Australian Financial Review on
Friday, Joshua Muravchik said it is "vital for Chinese leaders to
absorb one of the key lessons of the war in Kosovo. Alas, it is a
lesson which their conspiracy-minded way of interpreting events will
make it difficult for them to grasp."</P>
      <P>He referred to the recent reaction of mainland Chinese leaders
following the accidental bombing of the mainland Chinese Embassy in
Belgrade.</P>
      <P>"While Beijing cannot bring itself to believe that the targeting
of its embassy was unintentional, the truth is that the entire war
was unintended. Strange though it may seem, that is the way America
usually gets into its wars," he said.</P>
      <P>"This point takes on ominous implications when it is applied to
Taiwan, which is the most likely flash point for a violent conflict
between America and China. Because Beijing regards Taiwan as falling
within its sovereignty, it steadfastly refuses to renounce the use of
force to regain control over the island," he noted.</P>
      <P>He urged mainland China to consider the United States' war record
before deciding future moves against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He said at the outbreak of the World War I in 1914, US President
Woodrow Wilson declared neutrality, but two years later, he
discovered that America needed to enter the fray in order to "make
the world safe for democracy." The United States has also been drawn
into other conflicts that it originally intended to avoid.
"Americans never want to fight, but once mayhem begins, they have a
hard time remaining aloof from it."</P>

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING NOT TO INTERFERE WITH ROC'S NEXT PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION: MAC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   June  11  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China is not expected to
interfere with the Republic of China's next presidential election
nor will it repeat its past mistake of resorting to saber-rattling,
a senior mainland affairs official said on Friday.</P>
      <P>Su Chi, chairman of the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC), made the remarks during a seminar on political and economic
situation on both sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>When the ROC held its first-ever direct presidential election in
March 1996, mainland China conducted live-fire military exercises
and lobbed missiles into waters near Taiwan in addition to
publishing a series of articles criticizing President Lee Teng-hui
in an apparent attempt to prevent Lee from winning the historical
election.</P>
      <P>Su said he does not think that mainland China will again use such
a failed strategy when the ROC holds its second direct presidential
election next year.</P>
      <P>"I also don't think that Beijing authorities will interfere with
our coming presidential election," Su said. "Nevertheless, we'll
stay alert on Beijing's possible attempts to influence the result of
our election, including providing campaign funds for presidential
hopefuls," he stressed.</P>
      <P>Su said if the ROC finds that mainland China tries to interfere
with its presidential election, relations across the Taiwan Strait
will certainly be adversely affected.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the ROC's top mainland policy planner said he hopes
details concerning a planned visit to Taiwan this autumn by Wang
Daohan, head of the Beijing-based Association for Relations Across
the Taiwan Strait (ARATS), can be set in the near future.</P>
      <P>Taipei's Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) proposed on Thursday
that its deputy secretary-general, Jan Jyh-horng, lead a delegation
to visit Beijing from June 27 through June 29 to discuss with ARATS
officials an itinerary for Wang's Taiwan visit.</P>
      <P>"The MAC, which oversees SEF operations, hopes Jan's Beijing
visit can produce definite results, including setting dates and
itinerary for Wang's visit," Su said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Su said he hopes the two sides will also discuss some
non-political practical issues closely related to people's rights and
interests during Jan's Beijing visit. Such issues include
cross-strait fishing disputes and repatriation of mainland Chinese
hijackers and illegal immigrants.</P>
      <P>SEF and ARATS are semi-official bodies authorized by their
respective governments to handle cross-strait exchanges in the
absence of official contacts.</P>
      <P>It remains uncertain whether ARATS will agree to Jan's planned
June 27-29 visit to Beijing as the intermediary body originally
invited Jan to visit the mainland from June 22 through June 24. Jan
cannot accept ARATS invitation because during that period SEF will
sponsor a golf tournament in Taipei for Taiwan investors in mainland
China.</P>
      <P>Wang, a former Shanghai mayor and mentor to mainland Chinese
President Jiang Zemin, promised to make a reciprocal visit to
Taiwan when he met with his Taiwan counterpart SEF Chairman Koo
Chen-fu in Shanghai last October.</P>
      <P>According to a preliminary agreement reached earlier this year
between SEF and ARATS, Wang will visit the island this fall.
However, no definite dates have been set yet.</P>

    <HEADLINE>OVER 100 LEGISLATORS ENDORSE UNICAMERAL PROPOSAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  11  (CNA)
(By Wendy Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Over 100 legislators have given their
endorsement to a unicameral proposal initiated by Legislator Shen
Fu-hsiung of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and
Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator Chen Hung-chi.</P>
      <P>Shen brought up the proposal during a Friday meeting of the
legislature's Procedure Committee, in hopes of getting the proposal
added to the Legislative Yuan's agenda for next week.</P>
      <P>Shen, Chen and KMT Legislator Eugene Jao displayed the
single-chamber parliament proposal, endorsed by over 100 legislators,
during a Friday morning press conference.</P>
      <P>The question of whether to retain or abolish the National
Assembly (NA) has become a popular subject recently, as has the
question of whether Taiwan needs a two-chamber parliament system,
Shen said.</P>
      <P>All jurisdictional conflicts between the NA and the Legislative
Yuan stem from the presence of two separate representative organs,
Shen said.</P>
      <P>The proposal for a single parliamentary office needs more support
from "people of noble aspirations," he said.</P>
      <P>The proposal contains four main points:</P>
      <P>-- The Legislative Yuan believes the presence of two central
civil representative organs, the NA and the Legislative Yuan, causes
conflicts of jurisdiction, which require immediate reformation to
resolve;</P>
      <P>-- The Legislative Yuan believes the present two-chamber
parliament system is not essential for the Republic of China, nor
does it solve the above problem;</P>
      <P>-- The Legislative Yuan advocates the deletion of chapters three
and six of the constitution concerning the NA and the Legislative
Yuan, and the addition of a new chapter on a single parliament as the
Republic of China's sole parliamentary organ. Moreover, the total
number of parliamentary members must not exceed 225; and</P>
      <P>-- The Legislative Yuan proposes, under the premise of
accomplishing the previous resolution, to lengthen the term of
current assembly members to the end of the fourth legislature's term.</P>
      <P>Over a hundred deputies have given their endorsement to the
proposal, including 18 KMT legislators, all 72 DPP legislators, 10
independents and one from another sub-group of the legislature.</P>
      <P>But NA deputies were mixed in their reactions to this proposal on
Friday.</P>
      <P>DPP NA Convener Chen Ching-te pointed out that according to
constitutional amendment procedures, legislators as well as NA
deputies, have the right to propose amendments to the constitution.</P>
      <P>But the proposed amendments must receive legislative approval,
and the NA must receive six months' notice before the amendments are
handed over to the assembly, he said. As the NA is already in
session, it seems too late for the legislators to make the motion, he
said.</P>
      <P>This proposal should have been made a long time ago, Chen said,
adding that the bill is "in the right direction but lacks sincerity."</P>
      <P>Chen said he doubted whether the bill would pass the legislature,
since this type of proposal appears in every session of the NA.</P>
      <P>KMT NA Working Committee Director Chen Ching-jen said the bill
was proposed by legislators, and is not on the NA's agenda for the
current session, which deals mainly with discussing proposed
constitutional amendments.</P>
      <P>The legitimacy of a single-chamber parliament commands careful
consideration, since the ROC government has been a two-chamber
parliament system from the beginning, Chen said, adding that the
Council of Grand Justices has already explained that parliamentary
reform requires national consensus.</P>
      <P>Chen said he does not oppose the unicameral proposal, but he
asked for caution, saying that the legislators were too hasty in
their action and that the NA and the legislature cannot be abolished
rashly.</P>
      <P>New Party NA Vice Convener Wu Cheng-chun pointed out that the
focus of the NA's current session should be reformation of
parliamentary functions and that the NP has already started
considering parliamentary reformation.</P>
      <P>The NP is still in discussions over whether the parliament should
move toward an unicameral system, Wu said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The French Institute in Taipei (FIT)
reassured the Taiwan public on Friday that French-made dairy products
are not dioxin-contaminated.</P>
      <P>The FIT quoted a written statement issued by the French
Agriculture and Fisheries Ministry which confirmed that no French
dairy products have been contaminated by the cancer-causing dioxin.</P>
      <P>A dioxin contamination incident in Belgium involving dairy goods
and animal feed has provoked a wave of public panic here about
imported European food, forcing local shop owners to clear a broad
range of European food products from their shelves.</P>
      <P>The FIT faxed the statement to the Department of Health, the
National Bureau of Standards, and the Board of Foreign Trade, in a
bid to ease public fears arising from the incident.</P>
      <P>According to the statement, the French ministry said it was
informed by Belgian authorities that only a limited number of
allegedly contaminated Belgian meat products have been exported to
France, and added that none of the suspect items have been
transported to a third country.</P>
      <P>After imposing a series of stringent monitoring measures, the
French government is sure that no dioxin-contaminated Belgian pork,
chicken, beef or dairy products are being sold inside France, and
that no such Belgian imports have been re-exported to other
countries, the statement said.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,   June   11   (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Macedonian Prime Minister Ljubco
Georgievski said here on Friday he hopes a large portion of the
Republic of China's promised US$300 million aid to Kosovars can be
used for reconstruction projects in Macedonia.</P>
      <P>Georgievski made the appeal during a tea party with a group of
local diplomatic journalists at the end of his six-day official
visit to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Georgievski said the Macedonian government and people are
grateful for ROC President Lee Teng-hui's generous offer to aid
Kosovar refugees.</P>
      <P>"We also look forward to seeing a part of the fund can be used
to help finance our reconstruction projects," the 33-year-old prime
minister said.</P>
      <P>Georgievski said the Macedonian economy has lost about US$1.5
billion because of the Kosovo crisis. "We need an estimated US$440
million before the end of this year to revitalize our battered
economy," he noted.</P>
      <P>Macedonia has a population of only about 2.2 million. Since
Yugoslavia began its ethnic cleansing in Kosovo early this year,
more than 240,000 ethnic Albanians in the Yugoslav province have fled
to neighboring Macedonia, inflicting a heavy economic burden on
Macedonia.</P>
      <P>Georgievski said the United States, the European Union and
several other major countries have agreed to financially support
Macedonia's economic recovery projects.</P>
      <P>"We hope East Asian countries, including the ROC, will also take
part in our reconstruction projects," Georgievski said.</P>
      <P>Commenting on some Taiwan opposition politicians' criticism of
President Lee's generous aid offer, Georgievski said he hopes major
political parties here and members of the general public can reach
a consensus on the aid program.</P>
      <P>Georgievski, heading a 59-member delegation of senior officials
and business executives, arrived in Taipei last Sunday for his first
official visit to Taiwan since the two countries forged formal
diplomatic ties in January this year.</P>
      <P>During his stay, Georgievski met with President Lee, Vice
President Lien Chan, Premier Vincent Siew and other senior ROC
officials to discuss concrete measures to boost bilateral exchanges
and cooperation.</P>
      <P>He also signed six agreements with Premier Siew to facilitate
trade, investment and economic cooperation between the two
countries.</P>
      <P>Georgievski also chaired the inauguration ceremony for the
Macedonian Embassy in Taipei and an investment seminar to court
Taiwan entrepreneurs to invest in his country for mutual benefits.</P>
      <P>On Friday, Georgievski toured the National Palace Museum in
suburban Taipei to view a large collection of Chinese art treasures.</P>
      <P>Georgievski and his entourage left Taipei for home Friday
evening.

      <P>Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
officials on Friday were stumbling desperately around questions on
President Lee Teng-hui's hotly debated US$300 million Kosovar aid
pledge, saying the amount "will not exceed the amount stipulated by
Foreign Minister Jason Hu."</P>
      <P>The previous evening, Hu had apologized for making "mistaken"
pronouncements regarding the amount of aid pledged for the Kosovar
refugees, but the public was still mystified over several issues,
including whether or not the aid pledge includes a US$7 million sum
already given to Macedonia. MOFA officials remained silent.</P>
      <P>While Hu now acknowledges the Kosovar aid package is indeed
US$300 million, the public is still demanding an explanation for Hu's
"slip of tongue" over the massive difference in the amount compared
with the aid figure of US$10 million he mentioned in a report to the
legislature.</P>
      <P>According to a MOFA press release, Hu said the US$10 million in
his legislative report was "part of the US$300 million aid package,"
but this failed to explain how the foreign minister was not privy to
the aid amount Lee later announced.</P>
      <P>MOFA European Affairs Director Liu Hsiang-pu said during a Friday
press conference only that the Kosovar aid plan is "connected with"
the Macedonian aid package, since many of the Kosovo refugees are
currently in Macedonia.</P>

      <P>Former Taiwan Governor James Soong gave a

Japanese political and economic circles and the local Chinese
community.</P>
      <P>Soong, who might be a candidate in next spring's presidential

the international community, is unable to enjoy the privileges it
deserves, and is therefore unable to do its duty as a member of the
international community.</P>
      <P>He called on the international community to allow Taiwan become a
member of various international organizations, and asked Japan to
throw its "just support" behind Taiwan when the island seeks to take

      <P>In answer to a question from one of the participants, Soong said
that the cross-Taiwan Strait issue is not solely a sovereign problem,

    <TEXT>
      <P>In preparation for the 2000 presidential
election, Taiwan has tightened its security, especially with regard
to mainland Chinese applying to enter Taiwan, a security official
said on Friday.</P>
      <P>Wang Chao-hua, an official from the National Security Bureau
(NSB), told a public hearing convened by Legislator Shen Chih-hui
that the move is to prevent "foreign intervention" in the election.</P>
      <P>At the hearing, Chang Min-teh, an official from the National
Police Administration, said Taiwan people's connivance at their
mainland Chinese counterparts staying and working in Taiwan
illegally poses a threa to national security.</P>
      <P>Citing a number of recent espionage cases involving mainland
Chinese spies as proof of his charges, Chang said many mainland
Chinese who visit Taiwan under the bilateral exchange program
disappear after arriving in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Beijing's insatiable interest in Taiwan's semiconductor industry
also has local security officials worried, Chang said, pointing out
that 17 of the 20 overseas groups which have visited the Hsinchu
Science-based Industrial Park, the heartland of Taiwan's
semi-conductor industry, last year were from mainland China.</P>
      <P>A total of 380,000 mainland Chinese have visited Taiwan since
1987 when the ban on cross-strait family reunions was lifted, said
Chang. The figure does not include the 36,000 mainland Chinese who
were caught as illegal immigrants during the same period.</P>
      <P>A total of 250 mainland Chinese have been caught trying to enter
the island with false documents, along with 120 phony mainland brides
who entered Taiwan via fake marriages with Taiwan residents with the
intention of working as prostitutes. Many of these phony brides
disappear after arriving in Taiwan, and even their Taiwan spouses do
not know their whereabouts, said Chang.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Liu Yun-sen, an official from the Investigation
Bureau, urged the Legislative Yuan to pass a Law on Protection of
National Classified Information which would provide a sound legal
framework to prevent the leakage of national secrets.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SEVEN TAIWAN INFORMATION-RELATED FIRMS RANKED AMONG WORLD'S TOP 100</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New  York,  June  11  (CNA)
(By Huang Kwan-chun &amp; Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Seven Taiwan companies were named by
US-based Business Week magazine as being among the world's 100 best
information-related companies in terms of their performance last
year.</P>
      <P>The seven companies, with their rankings in parentheses, are
Quanta Computer (14), Asustek (29), Hon Hai Precision (33), Arima
(36), Gigabyte (41), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (93) and
Compal Electronics (99).</P>
      <P>This is the second year that Business Week has compiled a list of
the top 100 information companies. In addition to companies that make
computers and related components, producers of software and
networking equipment are included on the list as well.</P>
      <P>They are chosen from a pool of computer and component makers with
annual revenues of more than US$300 million, while software and
networking equipment producers are expected to have annual revenues
of more than US$5 million.</P>
      <P>Their performance was measured according to four criteria:
stockholder profits, earning per share, the growth rate of a
company's revenue and its total revenue.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's highest-ranked firm, Quanta Computer, was named 14th
with an annual revenue of US$1.58 billion, which represents a growth
rate of 48.6 percent, or a yield of 74 percent to its security par
value, and a growth rate of 44.1 percent in stockowners' dividen.</P>
      <P>The Business Week issue with the list, due out next week, will
introduce the 100 firms, and the issue will include a story about
Taiwan semiconductor giant Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.,
which, the weekly said, has reshaped the world's wafer foundry
industry by expanding its business from the manufacture of wafers to
their design.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US LAWMAKERS PRAISE TAIWAN FOR AID OFFER TO KOSOVAR REFUGEES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  June  11 (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Eight members of the US Congress have
applauded the Republic of China on Taiwan for its decision to donate
US$300 million to help Kosovar refugees rebuild their homes, saying
Taiwan should be recognized by the United States and the entire world
for this selfless, charitable action.</P>
      <P>Rep. John Sweeney (R-N.Y.) told the House of Representatives
Thursday that he would like to applaud the ROC for playing an active
role in the "world arena" and working together to maintain world
peace.</P>
      <P>Saying humanitarian aid to Kosovar refugees is a common goal for
all countries, Sweeney also submitted President Lee Teng-hui's
statement regarding assistance to Kosovar refugees in recognition of
the ROC's honorable deed.</P>
      <P>Both his remarks and President Lee's statement were later
printed in the Congressional Record.</P>
      <P>Rep. Philip English (R-Pa.) said President Lee should be highly
commended for his leadership in announcing the aid package for the
refugees in Kosovo, and his generosity should inspire other wealthy
nations of the world to open their hearts and pockets to help the
war-torn region.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan is a geographically small nation, yet its government and
people have large, unselfish hearts. They recognize the need for
generosity toward the Kosovars, and they are always more than willing
to help the less fortunate throughout the world," noted English.</P>
      <P>The congressman added that "President Lee's offer of financial
assistance to Kosovo is very generous, and Taiwan should be
recognized by the United States and the entire world for this
selfless, charitable action."</P>
      <P>Rep. Peter King (R-N.Y.) then noted that despite mainland China's
diplomatic embargo, Taiwan unveiled on June 7 a US$300 million aid
package to assist the ethnic Albanians who have been forced to leave
their homes as a result of Slobodan Milosevic's genocidal campaign.</P>
      <P>The congressman said he rose on the House floor to recognize
Taiwan's continuing commitment to peace and stability in the Balkan
region. He then urged his colleagues to recognize Taiwan's sincerity
and commitment to join the international drive to help the Kosovar
refugees.</P>
      <P>Rep. Tom Bliley (R-Va.), chairman of the House Committee on
Commerce, was the first member of the US Congress to mention Lee's
aid package, commending on Wednesday the ROC president for his
actions.</P>
      <P>Sen. Max Cleland (D-Ga.), as well as congressmen Solomon Ortiz
(D-Texas), Dana Rohrabacher (R-Calif.) and Gary Ackerman (D-N.Y.),
also commended the ROC on Thursday.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN BUSINESS TYCOON INTERVIEWED IN JAPAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Tokyo,  June 12 (CNA)
(By Mike Chang and Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan business tycoon Hsu Wen-lung said in
an interview Saturday that Taiwan has emerged largely unscathed from
the region's financial storm, and he attributed this to the small-
and medium-sized enterprises that form the backbone of Taiwan's
economy.</P>
      <P>In an interview with The Nihon Keizai Shimbun, a major business
newspaper in Japan, Hsu said that Taiwan's small- and medium-sized
enterprises do not benefit from tax incentives. In addition, they do
not have strong financial support and could not possibly engage in
the type of over-investment seen among big enterprises in South
Korea.</P>
      <P>Hsu, founder and chairman of Taiwan's ABS and acrylic giant Chi
Mei Group, predicted that Taiwan's economic growth this year will be
between 4 percent and 5 percent.</P>
      <P>Hsu said that the Asian financial crisis is almost over, and the
big problems now are the political situation in Indonesia and
questions about how much longer mainland China can continue to uphold
its promise not to devalue its currency.</P>
      <P>He urged Japanese enterprises to join hands with their Taiwan
counterparts to make inroads into the mainland Chinese market, adding
that although Taiwan investment in the mainland has declined,
investments are nevertheless continuing, since there is still money
to be made there.</P>
      <P>But he said that as the mainland has encouraged anti-Japanese
sentiments among its people, it is only natural that Japanese
enterprises will not fare well in the mainland. He said that it is
best to cooperate with Taiwan to make inroads into the mainland
market.</P>
      <P>On the possible impact of Taiwan's presidential election next
March and of the return of Macau to mainland China on Taiwan's
economy, Hsu said that Taiwan's democratization, as championed by
President Lee Teng-hui, has made it impossible for Taiwan to go back
to its old ways, adding that the presidential election will have no
effect on the island's economy.</P>
      <P>Hsu said that as long as the United States and Japan are united
on the Taiwan issue, then the mainland will be unable to invade
Taiwan. Calling Japan's attitude crucial, he said Taiwan has high
regard for Japan and, in particular, for Japanese Prime Minister
Keizo Obuchi for refusing to kowtow to mainland Chinese President
Jiang Zemin when the latter visited Japan last year.</P>
      <P>Hsu was the winner of the Asian Award sponsored by the newspaper.
He was presented with the award and a cash award of 3 million yen in
Tokyo June 2, though he donated all the money to an Asian
environmental protection group.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN PLAYS A KEY ROLE IN CHINESE CULTURE: PRESIDENT LEE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 12 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's existence plays a significant role
in Chinese culture, and that is the happiness of being the Taiwan
people, said President Lee Teng-hui on Saturday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a graduation ceremony at the Minghsin Institute of
Technology in Hsinchu, northern Taiwan, President Lee stressed that
Taiwan's culture -- its way of life and thinking -- will play a key
role in Chinese culture, and that the happiness of being the Taiwan
people is that the island's existence will allow mainland China's 1.2
billion people to enjoy the same lifestyle in the future.</P>
      <P>"This happiness does not belong to me alone, but it belongs to
everyone living on this island," he noted, adding that this is
effectively the focal point of what he calls "Taiwan people's
happiness" in his new book -- "With The People Always in My Heart."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Presidential Secretary-General Huang Kun-huei said at
an international seminar on Asian security and cross-strait ties that
President Lee still welcomes mainland China's top envoy Wang Daohan
to visit Taiwan as scheduled, and that Lee remains firm in his plans
to accompany Wang on a tour of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Huang said President Lee has not made any change in his plan to
accompany Wang on a tour of Taiwan when he pays a visit here, and
that officials of the Taipei-based Straits Exchange Foundation and
its mainland Chinese counterpart -- the Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) -- are still seeking to set a date
for ARATS Chairman Wang to travel to Taiwan this autumn.</P>
      <P>Turning to recent rumors that Wang has fallen sick and is
currently in critical condition, Huang said the Mainland Affairs
Council, the highest government agency in charge of Taiwan's policy
toward mainland China, has confirmed that the rumors are groundless
after multilateral verification.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Tokyo Governor Shintaro Ishihara has
politely turned down a proposal to establish a sister-city
relationship with Taipei, with Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou indicating
Saturday that he understood the decision.</P>
      <P>Ishihara told a news conference on Friday that he had received a
letter from Ma, suggesting that Tokyo and Taipei sign a sisterhood
agreement. "I did not make an affirmative reply," he said.</P>
      <P>Tokyo and Beijing are sister cities, and this year marks the 20th
anniversary of their relationship.</P>
      <P>Ma told the media on Saturday that he understood Ishihara's
position, and that Taipei City would continue to strengthen relations
with Tokyo through various channels.</P>
      <P>The mayor said he had asked former Control Yuan member Wang
Ching-feng to take a letter to Ishihara, extending his
congratulations on Ishihara's election as Tokyo governor and
expressing his hopes of entering a sister-city relationship with
Tokyo.</P>
      <P>According to Ma, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government's reaction to
his proposal was mild, while the Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly objected
more strongly, apparently out of concern over possible protests from
Beijing.</P>

Americans (APA) who are not involved in mainland Chinese espionage in
the United States.</P>
      <P>On May 26, at a hearing before the Asia and Pacific Subcommittee
of the House International Relations Committee, Ackerman questioned
some of the wording found in the Cox report. "There is a chill that's
going up and down the spine of every Asian American in the country
right now. This kind of language does a tremendous disservice to that
community," he said.</P>
      <P>At a May 25 press conference regarding the release of the Cox

cast a negative light on honorable Chinese and Asian Americans, who
are the leaders in many cases of our scientific community.</P>
      <P>"Let no one make any mistake that this report is in any way
attempting to reflect negatively on the contribution by hundreds of

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT LEE TOUTS ROC'S STRATEGIC ROLE IN ASIA-PACIFIC SECURITY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  12  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Lee Teng-hui said on Saturday
that the Republic of China on Taiwan has played a critical role in
the Asia-Pacific security mechanism.</P>
      <P>"Peace in the Taiwan Strait is also vital to the safety of
international shipping lanes in the West Pacific and to the prospects
of Asia-Pacific economic development," Lee said in his congratulatory
message to the opening of a seminar on Asian security and
cross-strait relation.</P>
      <P>In his message, Lee for the first time lauded the new Japan-US
Defense Cooperation Guidelines as "having positive contributions to
Asia-Pacific stability."</P>
      <P>Lee pointed out that the Asia-Pacific security framework faces
new challenges following the end of the Cold War and the
restructuring of international order.</P>
      <P>"Mainland China's provocative firing of missiles at Taiwan's
doorsteps, Beijing-Manila disputes over the Spratlys and North
Korea's nuclear and missile development plans have added up to the
uncertainty in the Asia-Pacific region," Lee noted.</P>
      <P>These factors have not only threatened the Asia-Pacific security
but have also affected regional economic development, Lee said,
adding that overcoming these uncertainties and creating a favorable
environment for regional economic development have become an urgent
task for both Asia-Pacific countries and the entire international
community.</P>
      <P>Noting that the future development of US-Japanese relations is a
cornerstone for Asian security, Lee said the newly revised Japan-US
Defense Cooperation Guidelines and the Japanese parliament's recent
passage of three bills to bolster the guidelines are of great
significance to Asia-Pacific security.</P>
      <P>Lee further said the strengthening of Japan-US defense
cooperation not only signifies the necessity of US military
deployment in the Asia Pacific but also reminds Japan that it should
play an even more active role in the regional security system.</P>
      <P>Another crucial factor to Asia-Pacific security is the future
direction of the Chinese community regime, Lee said, adding that
whether mainland China can move toward freedom and democracy,
forsake its pursuit of hegemony, and abide by current international
political and economic regulations will affect Asia-Pacific
stability and development over the next few decades.</P>
      <P>Lee said the US "engagement" policy toward mainland China is
aimed at inspiring it to move toward democracy and accept
general international regulations.</P>
      <P>However, Lee said, recent developments in Beijing-Washington
relations, including human rights issues, negotiations for mainland
China's seat in the World Trade Organization, humanitarian aid
for Kosovars and mainland China's technology theft, all signify
structural conflicts in their relations and the limitation of the US
"engagement" policy.</P>
      <P>Because of mainland China's instinctive resistance to foreign
force or influence, Lee said, mainland China is unlikely to engage
with the United States without imposing any restrictions or
self-protection measures.</P>
      <P>Stressing that Taiwan is located on a strategic point, Lee said
Taiwan has played a pivotal role in the US-Japanese security
cooperation system and the US engagements with mainland China.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Lee said, Taiwan's experience in liberalization and
democratization can serve as a driving force behind mainland China's
peaceful evolution and abandonment of its pursuit of hegemony.</P>
      <P>Therefore, Lee said, the US, Japanese and international
recognition of Taiwan's role in the Taiwan Strait stability
and Asia-Pacific security will help boost constructive
cross-strait interaction and the formation of a new
regional security system.</P>
      <P>The two-day seminar is co-sponsored by the Taipei-based
Liberty Times and the ROC's representative office in Japan.
Scores of Asia and international affairs experts from the
United States, Japan, Taiwan and other Asian-Pacific countries are
attending the seminar, which will close on Sunday.</P>

    <DATELINE>Canberra, June 12 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Benign sun-spots can turn into full-blown
skin cancer in a matter of four weeks, and standard treatments may
not be enough to fully eliminate them, warned an Australian scientist
at Sydney University.</P>
      <P>Professor Ross Barnetson told The Sydney Morning Herald on Friday
that in a survey of 50 patients, he found 10 out of 20 whose
sun-spots had recently turned painful had squamous cell carcinoma --
a form of skin cancer that affects 20,000 Australians a year and can
be fatal if it spreads to other parts of the body.</P>
      <P>He said about 370 Australians die annually from the cancer, the
incidence of which has doubled in the past decade.</P>
      <P>He said his findings suggested that a common treatment for
troublesome sun-spots or solar keratoses -- burning them off with
liquid nitrogen -- may be inadequate and that surgery should be used
more widely.</P>
      <P>He suggested that people with sun-spots seek medical attention
much earlier in the development of a skin lesion. But people tend to
neglect the danger of sun-spots until they feel pain, and that is a
dangerous sign, he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KOSOVO CRISIS INSPIRING TO TAIWAN: FORMER JAPANESE OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  12  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China on Taiwan should
learn from the recent Kosovo crisis, a former Japanese defense
official said here on Saturday.</P>
      <P>Tokuichiro Tamazawa, a former director-general of Japan's
Defense Agency, made the remarks at a seminar on Asian security and
relations across the Taiwan Strait, co-sponsored by the Taipei-based
daily Liberty Times and the ROC's representative office in Japan.</P>
      <P>Tamazawa said in his speech, titled "the new Japan-US Defense
Cooperation Guidelines and relations across the Taiwan Strait," that
military confrontation is the worst scenario in cross-strait
relations.</P>
      <P>"The United States and Japan will do their utmost to prevent
such a scenario from happening," Tamazawa said.</P>
      <P>The former Japanese defense official went on to say he thinks
that the Kosovo incident has a positive meaning to Taiwan. "I hope
Taiwan will learn a lesson from the incident."</P>
      <P>Tamazawa said the United Nations Security Council recently
endorsed NATO attacks on Yugoslavia with a vote of 14-0 on grounds
that Yugoslav ethnic cleansing in Kosovo had violated the UN human
rights declaration.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, Tamazawa said, mainland China will not
have any legitimate reasons to attack Taiwan so long as Taiwan does
not formally declare independence.</P>
      <P>In that case, Tamazawa said, the United Nations will certainly
support Taiwan. "This will also justify the UN and US intervention
in cross-strait disputes," he noted.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Tamazawa said he believes that so long as Taiwan does
not pursue de jure independence, the United States will take
necessary actions in accordance with its Taiwan Relations Act (TRA)
when Taiwan's security is threatened.</P>
      <P>"I'm convinced that Taiwan's security will be better protected
if it does not seek outright independence," Tamazawa said.</P>
      <P>The TRA is the US law regulating relations with Taiwan in the
absence of official ties.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Taiwan Provincial Governor James
Soong expressed interest in running in Taiwan's 2000 presidential
election during an exclusive interview with Asahi Shimbun, sources
said on Saturday.</P>
      <P>Soong said people have strong expectations of him at a time when
Taiwan people are eager for change. Therefore, he said, he will not
allow himself to let the people down. As he has done in the past,
though, Soong refrained from saying explicitly whether he would run.</P>
      <P>Speaking on how should Taiwan's next president should serve the
country, Soong said people look forward to having a strong guide, but
not a dictator. He said they want a practical, righteous and decent
man who always pursues the public's happiness before his own.</P>
      <P>Soong said he believes he has led in several polls because he is
perceived by the people as being such a person.</P>
      <P>Regarding the relationship between Taiwan and Japan, Soong urged
Japan to engage itself more with Taiwan, as the two countries share
the same national defense lines and interests.</P>
      <P>Soong met with the former secretary-general of the ruling Liberal
Democratic Party, Koichi Kato, and Ichiro Ozawa, chief of the Liberal
Party, during his Japan visit.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, they agreed to take as a lesson the collapse
of the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe to prevent mainland
China from falling into chaos, and to regard Taiwan as an example of
a country stepping toward a democratic society.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KINMEN KILLS CATTLE TO ELIMINATE FMD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 12 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Although only two bulls were diagnosed with
foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), an entire herd, totaling 65 head of
cattle, at a ranch in Kinmen County was slaughtered early Saturday as
part of government efforts to ensure Taiwan does not experience
another FMD epidemic.</P>
      <P>Veterinarians sealed off the "New Yao-chih" cattle farm, and took
saliva and blood samples from the cattle before injecting them with
barbiturates.</P>
      <P>The carcasses were buried in a huge pit on the ranch. Health
officials painstakingly lined the pit with a waterproof fabric before
the carcasses were dumped into it.</P>
      <P>They marked the burial site with lines and affixed a sign saying
the pit should not be opened for any reason within three years.</P>
      <P>They also sterilized the ranch where the disease originated and
limited access to it for at least six months. During the six-month
period, veterinarians will conduct regular checks to ensure that the
virus does not resurface, said health officials.</P>
      <P>A chief veterinarian from the Kinmen County Government said that
since no other cattle on the island were found to have FMD, an
earlier plan to vaccinate all cloven-hoofed livestock in Kinmen has
been deemed unnecessary.</P>
      <P>The country government, however, will intensively monitor the
health of the 3,106 head of cattle on the island by recording their
health examination results.</P>
      <P>A ban on the slaughter of other cattle took effect on Saturday,
to prevent the disease from spreading from cattle to the island's
pigs, which share Kinmen's only abattoir with the cattle.</P>
      <P>As a result, beef almost disappeared from the market on Saturday.</P>
      <P>Kinmen cattle were found to have FMD on Thursday. Taiwan
authorities have since imposed a ban on the import of Kinmen
livestock, although health officials refused to declare Kinmen, an
island 150 nautical miles to the west of Kaohsiung, as a FMD-affected
area, because only a few cattle were found to have the disease.</P>

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Haicang project initiated by the
Taiwan-based Formosa Plastics Group (FPG) in mainland China's Fujian
province has not been stopped, but instead will focus on hi-tech
sectors, Xiamen Mayor Hong Yongshi said on Saturday here.</P>
      <P>Hong, who is currently visiting Taiwan at the invitation of FPG
Chairman Y.C. Wang, said the FPG's Haicang project has never been
stopped, despite the fact that it has been temporarily shelved.</P>
      <P>FPG, Taiwan's petrochemical giant, launched a plan to build a
thermo power plant in Haicang in mainland China's southern Fujian
province, but was unable to carry out the plan because the Republic
of China government still bans Taiwan businesses from investing in
mainland Chinese infrastructure projects.</P>
      <P>Against this background, Hong said the Haicang plan will no
longer center on the petrochemical industry. Its focus has been
shifted to hi-tech and sophisticated sectors, he said.</P>
      <P>The FPG's Haicang project was submitted to Hong shortly after he
assumed the Xiamen mayorship in 1992.</P>
      <P>The Xiamen mayor made the remarks during a visit to the Mailiao
Port in central Yunlin County, where FPG is building a sixth naphtha
cracker plant.</P>
      <P>Impressed by the plant's large scale, Hong said he believes that
such an investment will undoubtedly benefit all of Taiwan society.</P>
      <P>As to the question of whether he has reached any concrete
agreement with FPG in regard to bilateral cooperation, Hong was
reluctant to elaborate, saying only that the economies of Taiwan and
mainland China are complementary in nature, and that he would welcome
any cooperative venture between the two sides.</P>
      <P>Hong, the leader of an eight-member delegation composed of Xiamen
City government officials, arrived in Taiwan on Wednesday, and is
slated to depart here on Monday.</P>

      <P>Premier Vincent Siew's Cabinet has a low
credit among local college students, according to the results of an
opinion poll released on Saturday.</P>
      <P>The telephone survey of 1,127 students randomly selected from
local colleges and universities showed that the overall performance
of Siew's Cabinet received a score of only 49.77 points on a
zero-100 measurement scale.</P>
      <P>Premier Siew's performance score was also low at 52.59 points,
according to the poll.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted by the National Taiwan University of
Science and Technology at the request of opposition New Party
Legislator Lai Shih-pao.</P>
      <P>Poll results showed that none of the ministries, councils and
departments under the Executive Yuan managed to receive a "passing"
score of 60 points.</P>
      <P>The Council of Agriculture received the highest score of 57.67
points, while the Ministry of Transportation and Communications
(MOTC) got the lowest rating of 46.93 points.</P>
      <P>A cross-analysis based on gender found that male students were
most dissatisfied with the MOTC, the Environmental Protection
Administration (51.13 points) and the Ministry of the Interior
(51.29 points) in that order.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, female students were most dissatisfied with the MOTC,
the Ministry of Education (50.97 points) and the Ministry of Finance
(52.3 points).</P>
      <P>Lai said the poll results indicate that college students are
very concerned about issues related people's living or livelihood as
they are generally most dissatisfied with the performance of
agencies responsible for traffic, education, environmental
protection, public order and crime.</P>
      <P>Lai said college students will be a major source of votes in
next year's presidential election. "I suggest that all presidential
hopefuls pay more attention to these young opinion leaders," he
said, adding that he believes Taiwan's future top leader should be
concerned about domestic and livelihood issues as well as have

    <TEXT>
      <P>Jesse Helms, chairman of the US Senate
Foreign Relations Committee, and two other senators on Friday sent
letters to their colleagues, calling for their support for the Taiwan
Security Enhancement Act introduced last March.</P>
      <P>The letters, signed by Helms, Frank Murkowski and Robert
Torricelli, stated that the threat to Taiwan from mainland China is
on the rise.</P>
      <P>Therefore, they said the United States should remain steadfast by
continuing to meet its obligations under the Taiwan Relations Act
(TRA), by providing Taiwan with the means to maintain a sufficient
self-defense capability.</P>
      <P>As of June 11, the bill has been co-sponsored by seven senators
from the Democratic and the Republican Parties.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Security Enhancement Act contains three major thrusts:</P>
      <P>-- Ensuring that Taiwan has the necessary equipment to maintain
its self-defense capabilities as promised under the TRA, by
authorizing the sale to Taiwan of a broad array of equipment and
defensive weapons;</P>
      <P>-- Bolstering the process for such sales to Taiwan by prohibiting
politically motivated reductions in US arms sales, requiring an
increase in staffing at the American Institute in Taiwan, and
requiring an annual presidential report to Congress on Taiwan's
defense needs; and</P>
      <P>-- Redressing deficiencies in Taiwan's readiness by supporting
increased Taiwanese participation at US military colleges, expanded
military exchanges and joint training, and establishing direct
communications between the two countries' militaries.</P>
      <P>A similar bill introduced in the House of Representatives last

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  12  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A ruling Kuomintang vice presidential
hopeful on Saturday called for more balanced distribution of
political resources among different ethnic groups.</P>
      <P>Wu Poh-hsiung, a senior adviser to President Lee Teng-hui, made
the appeal at a seminar on balanced development of ethnic groups in
the 21st century.</P>
      <P>Wu, a popular Hakka politician who once served as Taipei mayor,
interior minister and KMT secretary-general, said if political
resources are not distributed in proportion to demographic
structure, minority ethnic groups will become increasingly
disgruntled in the long run.</P>
      <P>In the past, Wu said the government was anxious to promote
mandarin Chinese among local people. As a result, mother tongues of
minority ethnic groups here had been suppressed.</P>
      <P>"Thanks to Taiwan's democratization, the situation has
improved," Wu said, adding that nowadays, Taiwanese dialect and
grassroots folk culture have received much attention and
promotion.</P>
      <P>However, Wu said, mother tongues and folk cultures of Hakka and
aboriginal tribal groups have received far less attention.</P>
      <P>"Today, we see a large number of Taiwanese-language programs on
television, while TV programs featuring Hakka and aboriginal
languages remain few," Wu noted.</P>
      <P>Wu said he is worried that long-term disregard of Hakka and
aboriginal languages and cultures may restrict these groups' access
to political and economic resources.</P>
      <P>"I hope to see more balanced cultural preservation and
allocation of political and economic resources among various ethnic
groups on this island," Wu said.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Wu, a devout Buddhist follower, said he would not
like to see conflicts or rifts among different ethnic groups
simply because of political competition.</P>
      <P>Wu has made no secret his intention to seek the KMT's nomination
as its vice presidential candidate in next year's presidential
election.</P>

      <P>The fifth Taiwan-Poland Economic

trade officials and business leaders from both countries taking part.</P>
      <P>The conference will be jointly presided over by Lin Chen-kuo,
chairman of the Taipei-based China External Trade Development Council
(CETRA), and Miroslaw Kuklinski, a Polish parliamentarian who is
familiar with foreign trade and relations, said officials from the
Euro-Asia Trade Organization (EATO), which is sponsoring the event.</P>
      <P>During the one-day conference, Kuklinski, who is also an
influential member of the Poland-Taiwan Friendship Committee under
the Parliament of Poland, will deliver a keynote speech on how to
accelerate bilateral trade ties between Poland and the Republic of
China (ROC).</P>
      <P>Adam Pawlowicz, director of the Foreign Investment Bureau of
Poland, will also deliver a speech on bilateral business and trade
exchanges between the two countries.</P>
      <P>P.K. Chiang, chairman of the Cabinet-level Council for Economic
Planning and Development, and Cho Shih-chao, deputy director-general
of the ROC Industrial Development and Investment Center, will also
make speeches on behalf of the government of the Republic of China,
which maintains no formal diplomatic relations with Poland.</P>
      <P>EATO and the Polish Chamber of Commerce, the co-sponsor of the
conference, decided to hold this year's meeting on June 14 to
coincide with Eurogate '99, an Eastern and Central European trade
exposition in Taipei that is jointly sponsored by CETRA and the ROC
ministries of foreign affairs and economic affairs, said EATO
officials.</P>
      <P>Delegates from Hungary and the Czech Republic who are now in
Taipei taking part in Eurogate '99 will also be invited to the
Taiwan-Poland Economic Cooperation Conference so as to allow Taiwan
businessmen greater opportunities to gain better understanding of
trade prospects and economic climate in Eastern and Central Europe,
the officials said.</P>
      <P>At the top of the conference agenda is discussions concerning a
proposed Taiwan industrial processing zone to be developed in Poland
by the Taipei-based Acelon Chemicals and Fiber Corp.</P>
      <P>Acelon will finance the development of the zone, which is a
133-hectare tract located in a now defunct state-run textile plant
compound, some 100 kilometers from the Polish capital of Warsaw.</P>
      <P>Two-way trade between Taiwan and Poland amounted to US$321.90
million in 1998, with Taiwan enjoying a surplus of US$152.90 million.</P>
      <P>Poland is currently the second largest trading partner of Taiwan
in Eastern and Central Europe behind Hungary.</P>
      <P>In addition to organizing large-scale Taiwan trade missions to
Poland over the last three years, CETRA, Taiwan's top foreign trade
arm, also chose Warsaw last year as the location of Taiwan's first
trade center in Eastern Europe.</P>

poll found.</P>
      <P>The poll of 3,000 owners and/or executives of private social
groups around Taiwan found that 38 percent would throw their support
behind Soong to be president of the Republic of China. Thirty-three
percent would support Lien, 27 percent would vote for Chen, while
only 2 percent would choose Hsu Hsin-liang, former Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) chairman.</P>
      <P>A high of 70 percent said Wu Poh-hsiung, who has also served as
Taipei mayor and as minister of the interior, would be the best
running mate for either Soong or Lien, if both participate in next
spring's race.</P>
      <P>If it is impossible for Wu to run on a ticket with Soong, the
survey found the next best options for Soong include former Kaohsiung
Mayor Wu Den-yih, Tainan County Magistrate Chen Tang-shan, and lawyer
Wang Ching-feng.</P>
      <P>If it is impossible for Wu to be part of a Lien ticket, Lien
should consider Examination President Hsu Shui-teh, Kuomintang
Secretary-General John Chang, Foreign Affairs Minister Jason Hu, and
former Kaohsiung Mayor Wu Den-yih, in that order.</P>
      <P>The poll showed that Taoyuan County Magistrate Annette Lu is the
most suitable running mate for DPP presidential hopeful Chen
Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>Wu Poh-hsiung, a popular Hakka politician, has made public his
intention to seek the KMT's nomination as its vice presidential
candidate in next year's election. The ruling KMT has apparently
decided to field Vice President Lien Chan as the sole presidential
candidate.</P>
      <P>Former Taiwan Governor James Soong, also a senior KMT member, may
jump into the race as an independent candidate. "The decision (to
run) was made, and there is no turning back," said Soong Saturday
upon returning to Taiwan after a visit to Japan.</P>
      <P>The survey, conducted by telephone between June 4 and 11, totaled
15,37 valid responses.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAINLAND CHINA SHOULD ALLOW PARTIAL DEMOCRATIZATION: MAC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,    June   13   (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China should "allow
democratization for a segment of its people", particularly those who
live in urban areas, before expanding democratization to rural
regions, said Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman Su Chi Sunday.</P>
      <P>Su made the remarks during a cable television interview Sunday
morning.</P>
      <P>The mainland government's so-called "basic-level elections" are
restricted to rural areas only, the people do not possess freedom of
speech or the right to organize political parties. There is still a
long way from true democracy, Su said.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, the economies of coastal cities have developed
rapidly, because the people enjoy more knowledge and wealth, he said,
adding that mainland authorities should allow urban citizens to
democratize before further expanding it to rural parts.</P>
      <P>Once mainland China has achieved overall democratization, Su
said, its politics, economy and society will possess long-term
stability, and only then will cross-strait relations receive new
progress.</P>
      <P>In response to questions on cross-strait dialogue, Su said an end
to mutual hostility, Taiwan's role in the international community and
the three links are the mainland's priority concerns at present, as
well as highly sensitive political issues.</P>
      <P>If the mainland wants to address these issues, Su said, the
Republic of China (ROC) would comply. However, Taiwan's most pressing
concerns are investment protection and cooperative measures against
crime, smuggling, fishing disputes and illegal immigrants, said Su.</P>
      <P>The ROC wishes to resolve these problems first since they are
directly pertinent to Taiwan citizens' interests, Su said.</P>
      <P>In addition, Su said "ending the state of hostility" should not
be the title of cross-strait negotiations, but rather a result . It
must be achieved through concrete step-by-step measures to strengthen
mutual trust in order to reach a real conclusion to hostility.</P>
      <P>Su also pointed out three ways to increase mutual trust across
the strait. The first is to increase communication, especially
between top-level officials of the Strait Exchange Foundation (SEF)
and Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS).</P>
      <P>Second, Taiwan and the mainland should hold official talks on
specific issues, and sign as many agreements as both sides can
achieve, to gradually build trust.</P>
      <P>Finally, both sides must make sure agreements signed in the past
are put into actual practice.</P>
      <P>Su said mainland China has not been scrupulous in fulfilling past
agreements. For example, he said, according to the Kinmen Agreement
signed in 1990, the mainland government is supposed to extradite
mainland stowaways arrested by Taiwan authorities within 20 days.</P>
      <P>But according to Taiwan statistics, mainland China allows an
average of 130 days before extraditing their stowaways, adding a
large burden, financially and otherwise, to the ROC, Su said.</P>
      <P>Mainland China might have difficulties practicing these
agreements, Su said, but its failure to keep its side of the
agreement lowers mutual trust over the long run.</P>
      <P>"It is our belief that anyone who obstructs the practice of
bilateral agreements is the true destroyer of cross-strait
relations," Su said.</P>
      <P>In reply to relations between the SEF and ARATS, Su said the two
organizations used to be on rather amiable terms, but verbal and
actual threats from mainland China have affected the relationship.</P>
      <P>Lately the SEF and ARATS have rebuilt their relationship, this
year's relationship exceeds last year's, and next year will exceed
this year's; making the future outlook "positive," said Su.</P>
      <P>In response to mainland China's possible interference in Taiwan's
2000 presidential election, Su replied firmly that due to Taiwan
voter's high education level, autonomy, participatory will and voting
rate, if the mainland were to repeat past intervention, it would "pay
a price."</P>
      <P>Su said he believed mainland China would not make the same
mistake again.</P>
      <P>Su emphasized that peaceful and stable cross-strait relations
cannot be attained through direct political negotiations or by ending
mutual hostility, but rather through a gradual process.</P>
      <P>He also pointed out that even though there are no war-preventive
measures between the two sides, the ROC has already abolished the
Temporary Provisions Effective During the Period of Communist
Rebellion, restructured its military force and reduced its national
defense budget.</P>
      <P>President Lee Teng-hui and Premier Vincent Siew have brought
forth measures to create cross-strait military trust. Those,
including Lee's "Journey of Peace" proposal, are all in the hope of
cultivating mutual trust.</P>

      <P>While citing factors hindering
sisterhood ties, Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou said on Sunday there is
still ample room for Taipei and Tokyo to cooperate in a wide variety
of fields.</P>
      <P>Ma cited the two factors hampering the two capital cities from
establishing closer ties as the different political climates existing
currently in the Republic of China and Japan and the lack of formal
diplomatic relations between the countries.</P>
      <P>This factors, however, should not be barriers to Taipei and Tokyo
for further bolstering economic and cultural exchanges.</P>
      <P>Ma made the statement when responding to remarks made by
newly-elected Tokyo Governor Shintaro Ishihara, who reportedly said
on Saturday that Tokyo has no intention of establishing sisterhood
ties with Taipei.</P>
      <P>Ma said promoting city diplomacy is the established policy of the

      <P>He said he fully understands that there is no guarantee such
efforts will work out smoothly in every case, particularly between
Taipei and Tokyo. The Japanese capital is especially conservative in

    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China (ROC) President Lee
Teng-hui said on Sunday that influencing mainland China is Taiwan's
present priority as he called upon Taiwan citizens to stand together
in creating a brighter future for the 1.2 billion mainland Chinese.</P>
      <P>Lee was invited to speak at the National Taipei University of
Technology graduation ceremony Sunday morning.</P>
      <P>During his speech, he digressed from his prepared notes to defend
his massive aid pledge to Macedonia.</P>
      <P>Lee said he used to harbor a deep sense of "sorrow for being a
Taiwanese," but "the tragic history of the past has transformed into
a multi-fold of bliss." He urged everyone to understand Taiwan's
history and treasure today's accomplishments.</P>
      <P>Using a love for Taiwan as a starting point, Lee encouraged
everyone to strive to create a "beautiful future" for the country and
it people.</P>
      <P>In the past, education was aimed at teaching students how to "do
things," but now education should be focused on teaching them how to
think, especially about challenging issues, he said.</P>
      <P>In addition, the president said that people should throw away
traditional thinking and behavior. Lee cited large business
corporations that have gone out of business due to their inability to
change, and small companies have been able to change the world
because they know how to think.</P>
      <P>He used America's Microsoft software company to illustrate his
point, saying that while the company is thriving now, it has to
constantly retain a sense of crisis. Without knowing how to handle
challenges, Microsoft would be overtaken by small companies that know
how to deal with emergencies.</P>
      <P>He encouraged the graduating class to realize their

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  13  (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's export competitiveness has been
continually weakening since the outbreak of the Asian financial
crisis in mid-1997, a report of the Taiwan Institute of Economic
Research (TIER) indicated on Sunday.</P>
      <P>The weakness is particularly obvious in Taiwan's market share and
business competitiveness in Japan and the United States, according to
the report. Local exporters are advised to improve product quality
and lower costs, as well as to work harder to increase market share
and collect trade information.</P>
      <P>The TIER report analyzed the exports of 10 eastern Asian countries
to the world's four major import markets -- the United States, Japan,
mainland China, and the European Union as a whole.</P>
      <P>TIER statistics show that in 1998 the total market share of Asian
countries in mainland China reached 56.27 percent. They enjoyed
a 36.47 percent market stake in the US market, 34.89 percent in
Japan, and 5.35 percent in the EU market.</P>
      <P>Eastern Asian economies' market share in both the US and Japan
registered drops after the Asian financial meltdown, the TIER said.</P>
      <P>According to the report, Taiwan's exports to Japan sustained the
largest drop. The drop was mainly a result of Japan's economic
slowdown and the suffering caused by the Asian financial storm, both
of which shrunk Japan's external demands, the report analyzed.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's exports to the American and mainland markets have been
reduced since the start of the regional financial crisis, due to the
fact that Taiwan has faced stronger challenges than other
competitors, the report said.</P>
      <P>The report suggested local export companies move into the EU
market, which represents a new market to be explored and developed.</P>

    <HEADLINE>COA  WILL  INSPECT  ALL CLOVEN-FOOTED ANIMALS THIS WEEK FOR FMD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  13  (CNA)
(By David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council of Agriculture (COA) will
convene an islandwide meeting on Monday to discuss the inspection of
Taiwan's cattle, sheep and goats in a bid to discover if
domestic animals are infected with the deadly food-and-mouth disease
(FMD).</P>
      <P>FMD epidemics occurred throughout mainland China in May. The
disease there reportedly affected not only pigs but other
cloven-hoofed animals, including cattle, sheep, goats and even
camels.</P>
      <P>The new strain of FMD is very troubling for COA officials
as it, unlike the strain two years ago that didn't infect cattle,
sheep and goats, can be spread to all cloven-hoofed animals.</P>
      <P>COA officials said that they are not worried that cattle in
Taiwan have become infected by the Kinmen FMD strain. Instead, they
fear that cattle from mainland China may have been smuggled into
Taiwan through Kinmen.</P>
      <P>Some 295 head of Kinmen cattle were shipped to Taiwan between
January and May of this year. All were delivered to slaughterhouses
in Tainan County and Panchiao, Taipei County.</P>
      <P>On May 25 the COA began an all-out inspection of cattle, sheep
and goats on the offshore Kinmen, Penghu and Matsu islands in an
attempt to prevent the spread of FMD. During that inspection two oxen
on Kinmen's Hsin Yao Chi Range were found to be infected with the
disease.</P>
      <P>The identification of the FMD virus in the two Kinmen oxen
prompted quarantine officials from Taiwan to slaughter and bury on
June 11 all 45 head of cattle on the Hsin Yao Chi Range in an attempt
to eradicate the highly contagious disease.</P>
      <P>COA officials said that prior to this week's inspection of
domestic cattle, sheep and goats, COA officials would not give
vaccine injections in order to prevent the animals from producing
antibodies, causing the inspection results to be inaccurate.</P>
      <P>The COA has adopted a policy of deterrence, that is to say, once
a new case of FMD is found, the infected animal will soon be
isolated.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAO, DENG LISTED AMONG CENTURY'S GREAT POLITICAL LEADERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  June  14  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping have been
listed by a leading Australian newspaper as being among the greatest
political leaders this century.</P>
      <P>The Weekend Australian published a list of the 10 greatest
political leaders this century in terms of their effect on the
largest number of people over the longest period of time. List
members are Franklin Roosevelt, Harry Truman, Ronald Reagan and Teddy
Roosevelt of the United States; Vladimir Lenin, Joseph Stalin and
Mikhail Gorbachev of Russia; Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping of mainland
China; Adolf Hitler and Winston Churchill of Europe; and Mahatma
Gandhi of India.</P>
      <P>The list, compiled by respected columnist and foreign editor of
the Australian Greg Sheridan, contains 12 names instead of 10 because
he said it is impossible to omit any of the 12 and understand the
shape of our century.</P>
      <P>He ranked Roosevelt as the greatest leader of the century because
he restored confidence to the United States with his strong
determination and elan after being confronted with the Depression. He
also overcame US distaste for European wars to commit the United
States to World War II and ensured the defeat of Nazism.</P>
      <P>Mao, meanwhile, gave birth to Asian communism and effective
Chinese independence. But Deng is perhaps a more important figure
because he, much more than Mao, began the vast task of modernizing
mainland China, a process of incalculable consequence, Sheridan said.</P>
      <P>Truman was named to the list because of his decision to use the
atom bomb against Japan and for efforts to reconstruct Europe after
World War II.</P>
      <P>Reagan was credited with ending the Cold War and recasting US
domestic politics, Sheridan said. As for Teddy Roosevelt, he created
the modern United States and was the first president to conceive of
the United States as a great global power.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AUSTRALIAN MINISTER TARGETS LAWYERS HELPING BOAT PEOPLE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra, June 14 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia, alarmed by a growing influx of
boat people, is now attacking Australian lawyers who perform legal
services for them.</P>
      <P>Australian police and Coastwatch on Sunday intercepted two
Indonesian fishing boats carrying 86 suspected illegal immigrants at
a reef off the northwest coast of Australia in the Timor Sea. So far
this year a total of 35 boats carrying more than 1,500 illegal
migrants have been seized and detained.</P>
      <P>Immigration Minister Philip Ruddock said it is the capacity of
Australian law firms to delay the repatriation of refugees that helps
make Australia an attractive destination for illegal immigrants,
according to Glenn Milne, political writer for The Australian.</P>
      <P>The daily reported that Ruddock has now gone on the offensive by
referring the ethics and practices of one legal firm to both the Law
Society and Migration Agents Registration Authority.</P>
      <P>He said many of the illegal mainland Chinese landing on
Australian shores may simply be common criminals. In other words,
they are not duped innocents, the daily reported.</P>
      <P>This makes the behavior of the Australian law firms who then set
about representing these refugees even more suspect because their
arrival means more business for the lawyers, the daily reported.</P>
      <P>The daily reported such law firms seek clients through the ethnic
Australian press -- particularly within communities where it is known
there are a high proportion of illegals.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAINLAND MISSILES CAN HIT US HEARTLAND, SAYS REPORT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Hong  Kong, June 14 (CNA)
(By Stanley Cheung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland Chinese missiles can now reach
the heart of the United States after breakthrough technological
developments, the Hong Kong Standard reported Monday.</P>
      <P>Before the new developments, mainland missiles could reach only
the US West Coast.</P>
      <P>The report quoted mainland sources as saying that the development
has reduced the technology gap with the United States from between
15-20 years to 5-10 years.</P>
      <P>And it is now possible to target hundreds of missiles at once at
the middle portion of the United States, the sources revealed.</P>
      <P>The sources reportedly said the People's Liberation Army (PLA)
had developed technology to use solidified fuel in missiles, enabling
troops to point several hundred missiles at targets in the middle of
the United States with high accuracy.</P>
      <P>According to the report, in the past, mainland China had only 18
to 24 warheads ready for action, despite having the capacity for
more, because of technological and financial constraints.</P>
      <P>In addition, the PLA has evolved the technology to launch
missiles from a moving launching base with high accuracy.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PHILIPPINE COMMUNIST LEADERS AGAIN UNDER THREAT OF ARREST</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Manila  June  13 (CNA)
(By Timothy Sun)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Philippine government is now preparing
warrants for the arrest of communist leaders, who have lost their
immunity from arrest and prosecution due to the termination of peace
talks between the government and the National Democratic Front (NDF).</P>
      <P>Secretary Serafin Cuevas of the Department of Justice said his
office is now working with the Philippine National Police (PNP) and
National Bureau of Investigation to prepare the arrest warrants.</P>
      <P>"This service of warrants of arrest will only be covering those
involved in the peace treaty negotiations. They do not involve other
members of other insurgent groups," Cuevas said.</P>
      <P>He explained the Joint Agreement on Safety and Immunity
Guarantees (JASIG), which had bestowed on these communist leaders
immunity from arrest and prosecution, became void after the end of
peace talks.</P>
      <P>Because of the talks, Cuevas said, NDF leaders with standing
arrest warrants had been extended immunity guarantees during the
peace negotiations. But they will now find themselves again subject
to arrest.</P>
      <P>"Those who have been granted exemptions and have been enjoying
the same, and by virtue of the slashing or cutting of their
privileges, they will be the ones subjected to arrest. Only those who
have standing warrants previously or earlier issued against them,"
would be under threat of arrest, he said.</P>
      <P>The government and the NDF, an umbrella organization of all
left-leaning groups in the country, held talks last month. The NDF
terminated the negotiations in the wake of ratification by the Senate
of the Philippine-US Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA).</P>
      <P>But while it terminated the JASIG along with the peace
negotiations, the government has given NDF leaders a month's grace
period before it serves the warrants of arrest.</P>
      <P>The government is now considering holding peace talks with other
communist leaders at the regional level.</P>
      <P>Also, the government is mulling an order to the PNP to help the
armed forces of the Philippines carry out counter-insurgency
operations.
 Last weekend, President Joseph Ejercito Estrada reiterated that
the government would go after NDF members who have insisted on
violating the constitution.</P>
      <P>Estrada added the government is now asserting its authority over
the NDF, making it clear that there is only one government and one
constitution in the Philippines.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC AIR FORCE TO SLOW COMMISSIONING OF F-16 WINGS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  14 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ROC Air Force has decided to slow the
commissioning of its F-16 jet fighter wings and will prolong F-16
pilot training to enhance their capability to operate the highly
advanced warplanes, a senior official said on Monday.</P>
      <P>The Air Force General Headquarters (AFGH) made the decision
after three of its F-16 fighters crashed during routine training
flights over the past year.</P>
      <P>The AFGH official said Defense Minister Tang Fei, who once
served as air force commander-in-chief, has ordered the air force to
conduct a thorough review of the replacement of its fleet with F-16
fighters and related manpower training programs.
 In response to Tang's directives, the official said, air force
authorities have decided to extend the F-16 pilots' mandatory
training period from the current six months to eight months.
 "The extended training is aimed at helping the trainees get more
familiarized with the US-made fighter and upgrading their ability to
operate the high-performance warplane," noted the official,
who preferred anonymity.</P>
      <P>The ROC Air Force struck a deal with the United States in 1992
for purchasing 150 F-16s as part of its military modernization plan.
the Air Force plans to form two F-16 wings, one stationed in the
Chiayi air base in southern Taiwan and the other in the Hualien
air base in eastern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The Chiayi wing comprises four squadrons and three of them have
so far been commissioned, while the Hualien wing will have three
squadrons and only one has entered services for combat preparedness.</P>
      <P>Noting that F-16 is a multifunctional, all-weather,
high-performance warplane, the AFGH official said it can not only
intercept enemy plane at high altitude but also can conduct
air-to-surface attacks. Its myriad functions, however, have
increased risks in operating the plane, the official said.</P>
      <P>The official conceded that the Air Force has adopted intensive
training courses in cultivating F-16 pilots as it hopes to replace
its aging fleet with the new second-generation warplanes as soon as
possible.</P>
      <P>"However, we have come to understand that it needs accumulation
of practical experiences to operate high-performance warplanes like
F-16s," the official said, adding that the Air Force is determined
to intensify manpower training, including both combat skill and
strategic training.</P>
      <P>In addition, the official said, the Air Force will conduct an
extensive check and review of the F-16 mechanical system and various
components.</P>
      <P>"We hope our twofold efforts will help enhance flight safety and
beef up our air defense capabilities," the official said, adding
that the delay in completing the commissioning of F-16 wings is not
expected to affect the country's combat readiness because the
replacement of two other types of second-generation warplanes -- the
locally developed Ching-kuo Indigenous Defense Fighters (IDFs) and
the French-made Mirage 2000-5s -- has proceeded smoothly.</P>
      <P>"At present, we still can maintain our air supremacy in the
Taiwan Strait," the official said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>COA CONFIRMS 2ND RANCH INFECTED WITH FMD IN KINMAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  14 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council of Agriculture (COA) convened
an emergency meeting on Monday to deal with the FMD situation on the
offshore island of Kinmen as a second ranch there was reported to
have been infected with the foot-and-mouth disease (FMD).</P>
      <P>COA officials after confirming that the Shao Ser Fu ranch has
been infected with FMD, demanded that all 45 cattle on the ranch be
slaughtered following the example after the outbreak on the Hsin Yao
Chih ranch last week.</P>
      <P>The COA has also decided to conduct FMD tests on all 3,000
head of cattle on Kinmen, the officials said.</P>
      <P>Lee Chin-lung, deputy director of COA's Bureau of Animal and
Plant Health Inspection and Quarantine, said that the COA conducted
random FMD checks on four Kinman ranches, including Shao Ser Fu and
Hsin Yao Chih in late May. It is rumored that the four ranches have
frequently smuggled cattle in from mainland China.</P>
      <P>Lee said that according to regulations governing the prevention
of communicable disease among animals, the entire cattle population
of affected ranches will be exterminated and that cattle on nearby
ranches will be closely monitored for movement in order to deter the
spread of FMD.</P>
      <P>He also announced a series of emergency measures to stop FMD
from spreading to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The measures include continued random checking on Kinmen, Matsu
and Penghu islands, the testing of animals along the route from Kinmen
into Taiwan, the testing of cattle and goats on ranches near
slaughter houses and examinations of animals on ranches located near
the coast that may have been have smuggled in from the mainland.</P>
      <P>The COA has asked that virus samples taken from infected cattle
on Kinmen be brought to a FMD laboratory in Britain for analysis so
as to find a suitable vaccine.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a member of an FMD task force under the COA, said that
if the Kinmen strain of FMD has spread onto Taiwan proper, the hog,
cattle and goat industries will be threatened.</P>
      <P>Professor Lai Hsiu-huei of National Taiwan University said that
the FMD strain in Kinmen is different from the FMD strain found in
hog population two years ago.</P>
      <P>The new strain of FMD is a big worry to COA officials as it,
unlike the strain two years ago that didn't infect cattle, sheep and
goats, can be spread to all cloven-hoofed animals.</P>

the Japanese parliament's approval of the new Japan-US Defense

      <P>Lee made the remarks while meeting with Tokuichiro Tamazawa, a

    <HEADLINE>CBC DENIES TAIWAN TO SELL GOLD RESERVES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 14 (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Central Bank of China (CBC) is neither
under necessity, nor will it sell its gold reserves, said an official
of the Issue Dept. of the CBC of the Republic of China on Monday.</P>
      <P>The official refuted reports that the CBC intends to sell its
gold stock in response to world gold prices dropping 10 percent since
early May.</P>
      <P>The recent plunge of the price of gold was triggered by concern
the International Monetary Fund (IMF) intends to sell as much as 10
million ounces of its gold stock to finance debt relief for some of
the world's poorest countries.</P>
      <P>The IMF reportedly holds about 103 million ounces of gold, the
second-largest stockpile in the world, following the US.</P>
      <P>A ranking official at the CBC's Issue Dept. pointed out that in
the wake of the UK's decision to sell 415 tons of its gold stock over
the next several years, the central banks of several other countries
have followed suit. The mass sell-off has resulted in a current price
of less than US$260 per ounce.</P>
      <P>Since Taiwan is not an IMF member, remarked a CBC official, its
gold should be held in reserve in case there are future financial
crises. Thus the CBC has no necessity to sell its gold reserves, the
official added.</P>
      <P>At the end of May, the CBC held about 13.57 million ounces of
gold reserves, according to latest statistics of CBC's Issue Dept.</P>
      <P>Although gold prices have fluctuated heavily in recent years, the
CBC did not purchase or sell any gold reserves during that period,
stressed the official.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOE BLASTED FOR SLOPPY HANDLING OF OVERSEAS SCHOOL SCANDAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  14  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of legislators on Monday blasted
the Ministry of Education (MOE) for alleged sloppy handling of the
resignation of the president of the Taipei School in Ho Chi Minh
City, southern Vietnam.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lee Ching-an (KMT-Taipei City) said at a meeting of
the Legislative Yuan's Foreign and Overseas Chinese Affairs
Commission that the ministry should not have allowed Chao Yen-wei,
president of the Taipei School in Ho Chi Minh City, to resign before
his adultery-related scandal is clarified.</P>
      <P>Chao was accused of having an affair with Shao Mei-ling, a
former teacher at the school. In the company of Legislator Lee,
Shao's former husband called a news conference early this month,
during which time he accused Shao of having Chao's baby while they
were still married.</P>
      <P>In response to Lee's criticism, Education Vice Minister Wu
Ching-chi said upon learning of the adultery charge, the MOE had
asked Chao to return to Taipei within a week to report on the
case. Chao, however, offered to resign on health reasons. The board
of trustees of the school already accepted Chao's resignation.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Kao Chung-yu, chairman of the MOE's Overseas Chinese
Education Committee also resigned from the school's board of trustees
following the report of the scandal.</P>
      <P>Lee said all these incidents indicate that the MOE has not
properly supervised the management of the ROC government-funded
schools abroad.</P>
      <P>Lee went on to say that complaints about sexual harassment and
other scandalous allegations have been rife in the Taipei School in
Ho Chi Minh City.</P>
      <P>In addition to Kao, four officials at the ROC's representative
office in Ho Chi Minh City are also trustees of the Taipei School
there. "I simply couldn't understand why the MOE had failed to
investigate all those scandalous allegations earlier," Lee said.</P>
      <P>Mu Ming-chu, also a KMT legislator, echoed Lee's view, saying
that the MOE should have carefully checked Chao's integrity and
character before appointing him as the Taipei School president. Chao
was a retired MOE employee.</P>
      <P>"The case has highlighted problems in MOE supervision of
overseas Taipei-funded schools," Mu said.</P>
      <P>Both Lee and Mu demanded that the MOE ask Chou Yen, director of
the Taipei representative office in Ho Chi Minh City, to return
within a week to deliver a special report to the legislature on the
scandalous case.</P>

    <HEADLINE>IN DEFIANCE OF CENTRAL GOV'T, KAOHSIUNG TO BEGIN LOTTERY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  14  (CNA)
(By Wendy Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Kaohsiung City government decided to
begin an experimental form of its proposed lottery Monday evening, in
defiance of the ban by the central government.</P>
      <P>Premier Vincent Siew in the morning warned the southern port city
not to rush through the lottery issuance, saying it is a legal issue,
and the city government should not politicize the event.</P>
      <P>The holding of lotteries is currently under the jurisdiction of
the Ministry of Finance (MOF), Siew said, and the MOF would deal with
the situation according to law, Siew said.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung City Mayor Frank Hsieh has decided to inaugurate the
lottery by offering to donate revenues from the first batch of 30,000
lottery tickets to charity. The tickets were available at a dinner
party Monday evening.</P>
      <P>Tuesday morning 240,000 lottery tickets will be on sale for
NT$100 (US$3.08) each.</P>
      <P>Despite beginning the sale of tickets, Hsieh has visibly softened
his original plan to formally begin the lottery on July 1. Hsieh said
the implementation of the formal lottery will depend on public
reception during the trial period.</P>
      <P>While Hsieh pointed out the central government should respect
local government rights, he also revealed that the July 1 issuance
appears uncertain.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung citizens, while interested in the lottery trial sale,
are criticizing the issuing process for being too "rash and
careless." The city government is accused of not announcing where
tickets can be bought or how to collect prizes.</P>
      <P>The 240,000 trial lottery tickets can be purchased from any of
the city's 28 organizations that benefit under-privileged citizens.
The largest cash prize is NT$500,000 (US$15,423), and the smallest
NT$200. Approximately one out of every six tickets is a winner.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN BUSINESS URGED TO TAP EU MARKET FROM POLISH BASE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  14  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan businesses should seek to tap the
European Union (EU) market due to its increasing importance in
international trade, Council for Economic Planning and Development
Chairman P.K. Chiang said on Monday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a one-day ROC-Poland Economic Cooperation Conference
which took place in Taipei, Chiang said that with the partial launch
of the new single European currency -- the Euro -- at the beginning
of this year, the EU is set to play an increasingly important role in
world trade.</P>
      <P>In terms of long-term economic trends, the EU is a potential
market rife with business and investment opportunities, and Taiwan
businesses should seriously consider investing in the region, Chiang
said.</P>
      <P>Pointing to the Evergreen Group as an example, Chiang said that
with its setting up of a branch in Poland, the Taiwan-based world
leading container fleet operator has moved a big step forward in
realizing its ambition of breaking into Europe, providing a major
fillip for many other Taiwan businesses, mainly in the electronics
sector, to follow in its steps.</P>
      <P>Conference Chair Lin Chen-kuo, chairman of the China External
Trade Development Council (CETRA), also said that Poland is an ideal
springboard for Taiwan companies wishing to edge into the EU market.</P>
      <P>Two-way Taiwan-Poland trade totaled more than US$300 million in
1998, with Taiwan enjoying a trade surplus of US$153 million, Lin
added.</P>
      <P>Currently, Poland is Taiwan's second-largest trading partner in
central and eastern Europe behind only Hungary, while Taiwan is
Poland's fourth-largest export market in Asia.</P>
      <P>H.E. Miroslaw Kuklinski, a Polish member of parliament who
co-chaired the conference with Lin, stressed that Taiwan and Poland
should try to strengthen their bilateral trade ties under the
framework of the World Trade Organization in light of Taiwan's
imminent membership of the world trade regulatory body.</P>
      <P>Taiwan businesses can take advantage of Poland's farm and
agricultural resources, while the high quality of Taiwan's hi-tech
products, such as computers and telecommunications equipment, can
provide great benefits to companies and offices all over Poland,
Kuklinski pointed out.</P>
      <P>Poland's cheap labor, good location, and free-trade economic
policy are other advantages which should lure Taiwan investors, he
claimed.</P>
      <P>In addition to more than 40 representatives of Polish firms,
scores of representatives from Hungary and the Czech Republic who
are in Taipei to take part in the 1999 Eurogate trade bazaar were
also present at the conference, according to the Euro-Asia Trade
Organization, organizer of the event.</P>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council of Agriculture (COA) convened
an emergency meeting on Monday to deal with the FMD situation on the
offshore island of Kinmen as a second ranch there was reported to
have been infected with the foot-and-mouth disease (FMD).</P>
      <P>COA officials after confirming that the Shao Ser Fu ranch has
been infected with FMD, demanded that all 45 cattle on the ranch be
slaughtered following the example after the outbreak on the Hsin Yao
Chih ranch last week.</P>
      <P>The COA has also decided to conduct FMD tests on all 3,000
head of cattle on Kinmen, the officials said.</P>
      <P>Lee Chin-lung, director of COA's Bureau of Animal and Plant
Health Inspection and Quarantine, said that the COA conducted random
FMD checks on four Kinman ranches, including Shao Ser Fu and Hsin Yao
Chih in late May. It is rumored that the four ranches have frequently
smuggled cattle in from mainland China.</P>
      <P>Lee said that according to regulations governing the prevention
of communicable disease among animals, the entire cattle population
of affected ranches will be exterminated and that cattle on nearby
ranches will be closely monitored for movement in order to deter the
spread of FMD.</P>
      <P>He also announced a series of emergency measures to stop FMD
from spreading to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The measures include continued random checking on Kinmen, Matsu
and Penghu islands, the testing of animals along the route from Kinmen
into Taiwan, the testing of cattle and goats on ranches near
slaughter houses and examinations of animals on ranches located near
the coast that may have been have smuggled in from the mainland.</P>
      <P>The COA has asked that virus samples taken from infected cattle
on Kinmen be brought to a FMD laboratory in Britain for analysis so
as to find a suitable vaccine.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a member of an FMD task force under the COA, said that
if the Kinmen strain of FMD has spread onto Taiwan proper, the hog,
cattle and goat industries will be threatened.</P>
      <P>Professor Lai Hsiu-huei of National Taiwan University said that
the FMD strain in Kinmen is different from the FMD strain found in
hog population two years ago.</P>
      <P>The new strain of FMD is a big worry to COA officials as it,
unlike the strain two years ago that didn't infect cattle, sheep and
goats, can be spread to all cloven-hoofed animals.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Eslite, which three months ago became the
first bookstore in Taiwan to run a pilot scheme for 24-hour
operations, has decided to continue its round-the-clock business, an
Eslite official said over the weekend.</P>
      <P>Lo Mei-ling, manager of the Eslite chain's flagship bookstore on
upscale Tunhwa South Road, noted that the pilot scheme which began on
March 12 has received an enthusiastic response.</P>
      <P>Lo estimated that nighttime (10 p.m. to 10 a.m.) revenue of the
bookstore in the three-month test period accounted for about 25
percent of the total revenue, which she said is much better than the
average ratio of 20 percent in some 24-hour convenience stores.</P>
      <P>Lo divided the nighttime patrons into several broad categories --
elderly patrons, graduate students seeking reference books, young
people who enjoy being out and about at night, those who regard the
bookstore as their personal library, and tourists from overseas whose
hectic daytime schedule does not permit them to visit the store.</P>
      <P>T.T. Tsui, founder of the Tsui Museum of Art in Hong Kong and a
noted antiques collector, said that he often takes the time to visit
the bookstore when he visits Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Tsui said he enjoyed the peace and serenity of the store at
night, adding that when typhoon Maggie hit Taiwan recently, he
visited the store and bought books worth NT$10,000 (US$308).</P>
      <P>Asked when most nighttime patrons tend to visit the store, Eslite
officials noted that peak time is between 10 p.m. and 1 a.m.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOFA URGES RIVAL KOREAS TO EXERCISE SELF-RESTRAINT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  15  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ROC's Ministry of Foreign Affairs
(MOFA) on Tuesday urged North and South Korea to exercise
self-restraint and resolve their disputes by peaceful means.</P>
      <P>The ministry made the appeal as gunboats from the two rival
Koreas traded fire on Tuesday in their first naval clash in the
Yellow Sea since the 1950-1953 Korean War.</P>
      <P>MOFA acting spokesman Chen Ming-cheng said the ministry has
ordered the Republic of China's representative office in Seoul to
keep a close watch on the developments in the Korean peninsula and
informed it of the latest situation there.</P>
      <P>Chen further said the ROC looks forward to seeing the conflicts
between the two Koreas resolved soon in a peaceful manner.</P>
      <P>Chen also urged local fishermen not to operate in waters near
the Korean peninsula during this period of turbulence in the region.</P>
      <P>In the past, many Taiwan fishermen operate in the Yellow Sea.
But the number has declined steadily in recent years because of
a drain on fishery resources in the region.</P>
      <P>Chen said the MOFA has contacted the Fishery Administration
of the Council of Agriculture for more information about local
fishermen's current operations in the Yellow Sea.</P>
      <P>According to foreign wire service reports, four North Korean
patrol boats and three torpedo ships intruded into South Korean
waters early on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The three torpedo boats fired at a South Korean patrol boat in
South Korean waters and the South retaliated by firing 100 rounds,
the reports said.</P>
      <P>One North Korean patrol boat was sunk and a torpedo boat was
wallowing in South Korean waters, the reports said, adding that
three other North Korean ships were heavily damaged and
retreated to Northern waters.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, seven South Korean soldiers were slightly
injured in the clash and two South Korean boats were
reportedly damaged.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for the South Korean government said it has put its
military on "Defcon three," which the military defined as "a serious
situation ... that could lead to deployment of North Korean military
forces."</P>
      <P>It was the worst incident between the Koreas since the South
Korean navy and air force sank a North Korean spy vessel off the
southern tip of the Korean peninsula last December, killing the
Northern boat's crew.</P>
      <P>But it was the first clash in the Yellow Sea since the 1950-53
Korean War and the first incident involving regular navy vessels from
both sides in recent memory.</P>
      <P>"It's an obvious challenge to our consistent tolerance and
efforts towards North Korea's intrusion which started from June 7,"
South Korean Defense Ministry spokesman Cha Young-koo said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Big spenders from Guangzhou are
increasingly being targeted by Australian casinos in addition to those
from Hong Kong, Thailand, Indonesia and other Asian countries.</P>
      <P>Crown Casino in Melbourne, the biggest gambling den in the
Oceania and its rival Star City in Sydney, are competing fiercely
between themselves and US casinos in Las Vegas, to lure big gamblers
from southern China, Hong Kong and other Asian countries as the
region recovers from the 1997 financial crisis, according to a survey
by the Australian.</P>
      <P>The daily reported Australian casinos are cashing in on the fact
that escalating wars between Triad gangs on Macau have convinced more
and more Chinese to take their money to Australia.</P>
      <P>The daily reported the Australian government has relaxed visa
applications for high-roller betters from southern China, who spend a
minimum of US$50,000 per visit.</P>
      <P>The daily reported wealthy lawyers, entrepreneurs and the
children of People's Liberation Army top brass and Communist Party
officials are among the high rollers.</P>
      <P>Before the Australian casino on Christmas Island closed last
year, among the clients were Thailand's Madam Thong Thip and wealthy
businessmen from Indonesia. That casino was officially owned by a
wealthy Indonesian businessman, while unofficially the owner was,
Tommy Suharto, the son of former president Suharto.

    <HEADLINE>CANADIAN  GROUP  DRAWS  ATTENTION TO UNPAID WORK</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa, June 14 (CNA)
(By S. C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Canadian social group said Monday elderly
women should not face poverty because they cared for sick relatives
or their children instead of joining the paid workforce.</P>
      <P>Mothers Are Women, a national women's group, released a hefty
manual on the scope of unpaid work and the problems faced by
caregivers in Canada.</P>
      <P>The organization has been trying to keep unpaid work on the
political front burner to force the government to do more policy
research on the issue.</P>
      <P>A 1992 Statistics Canada survey calculated the value of unpaid
work each year in the country to be between C$284 and C$318 million.</P>
      <P>Spokeswoman Evelyn Drescher said her group was not suggesting
that stay-at-home mothers or caregivers be paid for their work, but
that politicians take a closer look at the inequalities that
exist for such women in the tax and social system.</P>
      <P>"The issue is not compensation, it's understanding how the
economy functions and then how best social policy and economic policy
can be directed," Drescher added.</P>
      <P>The manual suggests that 53 percent of single female seniors live
below the poverty line because their unpaid work was not recognized.</P>
      <P>Beverley Smith of Calgary, Alberta brought a complaint to the
United Nations in New York about discrimination against unpaid
workers, specifically homemakers.</P>
      <P>The U.N. did not respond specifically to her case, but in a

    <HEADLINE>SEF DELEGATION TO VISIT BEIJING JUNE 27-29</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 15 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Jan Jyh-horng, deputy secretary-general of
the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), will head a delegation to
visit Beijing from June 27 through June 29 to set the stage for
mainland China's top envoy to visit this island later this year.</P>
      <P>SEF made the announcement on Tuesday shortly after it received a
message from its mainland counterpart -- the Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) -- concerning Jan's
travel plan.</P>
      <P>SEF and ARATS are quasi-official intermediary bodies authorized
by their respective governments to handle exchanges across the
Taiwan Strait in the absence of official contacts.</P>
      <P>ARATS said in its message that it welcomes Jan to visit
Beijing June 27-29 as proposed by SEF earlier this month.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, the Beijing-based association didn't respond to the
SEF proposal that the two sides conduct double-track dialogue during
Jan's upcoming Beijing visit.</P>
      <P>According to SEF's proposal, the agenda for Jan's talks with his
ARATS counterpart would include not only ARATS President Wang
Daohan's planned Taiwan visit this fall but also practical issues,
such as repatriation of mainland hijackers and illegal immigrants,
and fishing disputes.</P>
      <P>It seems that ARATS' main interest lies in discussing details
concerning Wang's Taiwan visit and political issues, such as
unification of the two sides.</P>
      <P>ARATS also politely rejected a SEF invitation to send its staff
members to take part in a SEF-sponsored golf tournament for Taiwan
investors in mainland China, to be held in Taipei on June 22.</P>
      <P>Wang, a former Shanghai mayor and mentor to mainland Chinese
President Jiang Zemin, promised to make a reciprocal visit to Taiwan
when he met his Taiwan counterpart, SEF Chairman Koo Chen-fu, in
Shanghai last October.</P>
      <P>According to a preliminary agreement reached between Jan and
ARATS Deputy Secretary-General Li Yafei in Taipei in March this
year, Wang will visit Taiwan this autumn. However, no definite date
has been set.</P>
      <P>On May 26, ARATS invited SEF Vice Chairman and Secretary-General
Shi Hwei-yow and Deputy Secretary-General Jan Jyh-horng to visit
Beijing from June 22 through June 24 to discuss an itinerary and
agenda for Wang's Taiwan visit.</P>
      <P>In a June 10 message to ARATS, SEF told ARATS that both Shi and
Jan cannot travel to the mainland during that period because of
their busy schedule in Taipei. It instead proposed that Jan visit the
mainland from June 27 through June 29.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US URGED TO ADOPT NEW POLICY TOWARD MAINLAND CHINA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  June  14 (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The United States (US) should adopt a
new China policy of limited engagement that firmly clarifies the US
commitment to the defense of Taiwan and the critical US interest in a
peaceful resolution of differences across the Taiwan Straits,
according to an American foreign policy expert.</P>
      <P>Bates Gill, director of the Brookings Center for Northeast Asian
Policy Studies, wrote in the latest issue of "Foreign Affairs"
bimonthly magazine that Taiwan is the most important security issue
dividing Washington and Beijing. Despite President Bill Clinton's
public statement a year ago of Washington's long-standing "Three
Noes" policy toward Taiwan, the People's Republic of China perceives
a gradual strengthening of US-Taiwan ties.</P>
      <P>Indeed, the senior fellow in foreign policy studies
at Washington's Brookings Institute noted, Taiwan's status as one of
the world's largest free-market economies and as an emerging
democracy sharply contrasts with the PRC, encouraging US support for
a fortified relationship with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Beijing thinks that such developments violate US pledges
and obstruct eventual reunification by encouraging Taiwanese
recalcitrance. But the status quo on which US-PRC understandings were
based 25 years ago is eroding, and "Washington and Beijing need to
think in an innovative manner how to reach a more appropriate modus
vivendi," said Gill.</P>
      <P>He stressed that for the United States "this means firmly
clarifying the US commitment to provide for the defense of Taiwan and
the critical US interest in a peaceful resolution of differences
across the Taiwan Straits." This dispute holds the greatest potential
for war between the United States and the PRC, so the two sides must
work patiently to avoid this outcome, added Gill.</P>
      <P>The senior analyst continued that US leaders must speak
realistically and candidly about America's interests and the
strengths and the weaknesses of the US-PRC relationship. At a
minimum, he wrote, " a new China policy should contain more realism
about the future relationship with Beijing: neither a full-fledged
containment strategy nor a whole-hearted embrace, but a clear-headed
mix of engagement and hedging -- a limited engagement."</P>
      <P>President Clinton's recent remarks about mainland China -- that
America has to work for a better future even as it remains prepared
for any outcome -- suggests a step in the right direction, said Gill.</P>
      <P>When US interests are strongly and consistently conveyed and US
policy openly acknowledges not just America's shared concerns with
the PRC but also its strategic differences, confidence in engagement
will increase and more domestic constituencies will get behind it, he
added.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Gill wrote, mainland Chinese leaders will
better understand the US perspective on both the opportunities and
limits of engagement, making the chances of bitter disillusionment
less likely. But this approach should not over-exaggerate the PRC's
power -- an all-too-often tendency that is not only divisive at home
but grants Beijing psychological leverage it can exploit in
diplomatic discourse, he said.</P>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Department of Health (DOH) officials
arrived at a detention center for mainalnd Chinese stowaways on
Tuesday to try to determine the cause of a mysterious disease .</P>
      <P>The DOH said that during the past month three people at the Ching
Lu detention center in Ilan have died and six more have been
hospitalized. On Tuesday another three were rushed to hospital
intensive care units.</P>
      <P>DOH and local health officials checked blood and urine samples of
more than 300 stowaways. After the tests, the officials announced
that preliminary results show the disease is not contagious.</P>
      <P>Officials from DOH's Bureau of Communicable Disease Center said
that the victims of the mysterious disease have complained of
weakness in their lower limbs. Testing found acidosis and an
elevation of muscle enzymes, leading the experts to believe the cause
was rhabdomyolysis, a disease often caused by drugs, trauma, heat
stroke or over exertion.</P>
      <P>The officials said that judging from the symptoms, the disease is
not contagious, and they are tying to learn why the stowaways became
infected en masse. A conclusive result of the blood and urine tests
should be known in one week, they said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the outbreak of the disease has caused some to call
for an investigation into its cause.</P>
      <P>One local newspaper reported that most of the mainalnd illegal
immigrants came from coastal provinces, areas that have poor hygiene
habits and people drinking well water.</P>
      <P>A China Times' report said that when illegal stowaways are
discovered they are sent by police straight to the detention center.
There the stowaways provide detention officials with only a very
brief personal history. The China Times report concluded that the
center has no way of knowing if newly-arrived detainees are disease
carriers.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GOVERNMENT SET TO TRIM CIVIL SERVANTS BY 65,000</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  15  (CNA)
(By Amanda Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The newly appointed chairman of the
Research, Development and Evaluation Commission, Wei Chi-lin, said
Tuesday that the government plans to reduce its number of civil
servants from 240,000 to 175,000 within five years as part of
government efforts to streamline its workforce.</P>
      <P>Wei made the statement in a seminar, sponsored by the Central
Personnel Administration and the Institute for National Policy
Research, on reducing the number of public servants to a suitable
level. The seminar comes amid strong public protests over Taiwan's
large number of civil servants.</P>
      <P>Wei said the central government intends to reduce the number of
civil servants it employs to 120,000 while the provincial government
and local governments will reduce their numbers to 35,000 and 20,000,
respectively.</P>
      <P>In addition, the number of people employed by state-run
businesses is set to be reduced from 140,000 to 70,000 in five years,
while the police and armed forces will undergo streamlining as well,
Wei said.</P>
      <P>In response to public complaints that there are over 600,000
public servants in the administrative sector, resulting in low
efficiency, Wei explained that the legislative, judicial and other
non-administrative sectors, which together employ 360,000 civil
servants, account for more than 60 percent of the total and are
mainly responsible for the large number.</P>
      <P>Wei said that the size of the reduction in Taiwan's civil service
should be based on a variety of considerations rather than a specific
figure. He said the consequences of any reduction need to be taken
into account.</P>
      <P>Wei said factors that should be taken into account include
administrative productivity, the current national development
strategy, the government's financial burden and the country's
employment outlook.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 15 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council of Agriculture (COA) announced
on Tuesday that all cattle raised in the offshore frontline island
of Kinmen will be barred from outbound shipment for one year.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the council said, all Kinmen cattle will be subject to
a three-year intensive monitoring over the foot-and-mouth disease
(FMD) infection.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet-level council made the announcement after cattle
raised in two Kinmen ranches were found to have been infected with
the FMD virus.</P>
      <P>Noting that the FMD virus is viable for up to three years in
cattle, COA Chairman Peng Tso-kwei said cloven-hoofed livestock
ranches in Kinmen must stay high alert over the next three years.</P>
      <P>"Even livestock farms in Taiwan must also be wary of the FMD
infection over the next three years," Peng said.</P>
      <P>To curb the spread of the disease, Peng said Kinmen cattle
should not be sent out of the island for a year.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Kinmen County Government on Tuesday slaughtered
all the 67 cattle raised at the Shao Ser Fu and Chen Cheng Tsai
ranches as some Shao Ser Fu cattle had been infected with the deadly
FMD virus.</P>
      <P>The nine cattle from the Chen Cheng Tasi ranch were also
slaughtered mainly because the farm is located between the Shao
Ser Fu ranch and the Hsin Yao Chi ranch whose cattle were all killed
last week when the farm was hit by an FMD outbreak.</P>
      <P>A 30-member team composed of COA animal quarantine officials and
staff members from the Kinmen Livestock Research Center began
cattle slaughtering and ranch sterilization early in the morning and
the work didn't end until Tuesday evening.</P>
      <P>Some residents in Kucheng and Hsienantsun villages near the
FMD-infected ranches staged a demonstration in front of the Shao Ser
Fu farm, protesting their hometowns from becoming animal graves.</P>
      <P>The protest ended only after COA and Kinmen County Government
officials assured them of taking proper measures to prevent
environmental pollution.</P>
      <P>The COA has also decided to conduct FMD tests on all 3,000 head
of cattle raised in Kinmen, which lies closer to mainland China
than to Taiwan.</P>

Taiwan's stock market by US Pensions 2000 and the Hong Kong branch
Morgan Stanley in April, US investment consultant Merrill Lynch plans
to hold a conference to assess the investment potential in Taiwan's
stock market, sources said on Monday.</P>
      <P>This shows the profitability of the local bourse has been widely
identified by global investment institutions.</P>
      <P>The second Asia-Pacific technology conference to be sponsored by
Merrill Lynch Taiwan Limited will be the first of its kind in Taiwan.
The three-day conference is scheduled to begin June 22, and taking
part will be the company's leading hi-tech analyst, Steve Milunovich,
and other analysts together with 100 heavyweight investors from
around the world.</P>
      <P>Peter Kerz, the general manager of Merrill Lynch Taiwan Limited,

    <HEADLINE>NATIONAL DEFENSE ORGANIZATION TO BE RESTRUCTURED: MND</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  15  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China's national defense
organization will be restructured in line with changes in styles of
warfare, weaponry systems, and management style and tools, Defense
Minister Tang Fei said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>"Following our troop reduction plan, we must now launch a
sweeping organizational restructuring drive," Tang told a routine
news conference held at the Ministry of National Defense (MND).</P>
      <P>In the past, Tang said, the military was responsible for training
manpower in various professional fields for its own use. "With the
expansion of education, our civilian education system now can train
various professional personnel to meet the demand of the MND, except
for some combat-related fields."</P>
      <P>Against this background, Tang said, all national defense-related
organizations should be restructured. For instance, many departments
at military academies can be phased out or scaled down. With the
implementation of the National Health Insurance Program, the number
of military hospitals can be reduced, and production of weaponry and
military equipment can be commissioned to private contractors or
state-owned enterprises.</P>
      <P>In response to a promise offered by Vice President Lien Chan to
shorten the period of compulsory military service, Tang said the MND
will conduct an overall review of the manpower supply and demand
before shortening the service period.</P>
      <P>Noting that weaponry renovation has helped cut the military's
manpower demand, Tang said the number of conscripts has often
exceeded demand in recent years, and wasted time spent waiting for
the MND's draft notice is a common complaint among Taiwan men of
service age.</P>
      <P>To address the issue, Tang said, the MND and the Ministry of the
Interior are working on a system which will allow some conscripts to
engage in specialized social services instead of compulsory military
service.</P>
      <P>He explained that the current two-year mandatory military service
period may be shortened by two to three months, depending on the
number of excess conscripts.</P>
      <P>If all goes smoothly, Tang said, the shortened service period
will be implemented as early as next year, allowing about 20,000
conscripts now on active duty to leave early.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Tang, a former air force commander in chief, said he
has ordered the Air Force General Headquarters to conduct a thorough
investigation of the three F-16 crashes to determine whether there
were common factors behind the incidents.</P>
      <P>"We must find out all possible problems with F-16 fighter jets
and check whether there is a gap in our combat readiness following
the three F-16 crashes," he said.</P>
      <P>The four-star general further said the air force has decided to
slow commissioning of the US-made F-16 fighters and extend the
mandatory training period for F-16 pilots from the current six months
to eight months.</P>
      <P>Taiwan struck a deal with the United States in 1992 to purchase
150 high-performance F-16 jet fighters. The air force has so far
formed four F-16 squadrons which are stationed at Chiayi and Hualien
air bases, respectively.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN'S THIRD ENGLISH-LANGUAGE DAILY LAUNCHED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  15  (CNA)
(By Wendy Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taipei Times, a newly published
newspaper owned by the Chinese-language daily "Liberty Times," and
touted as the first English-language daily launched by "native
Taiwanese," hit newsstands Tuesday.</P>
      <P>A party was held at the Taipei Grand Hyatt Hotel Tuesday
afternoon in celebration of the Taipei Times' inaugural issue.</P>
      <P>Guests of honor included Republic of China President Lee
Teng-hui, Vice President Lien Chan, Premier Vincent Siew, President
of the Examination Yuan Hsu Shui-teh, Kuomintang Secretary-General
John Chang and Democratic Progressive Party Chairman Lin Yi-hsiung.</P>
      <P>Liberty Times founder Lin Rong-san said in his opening speech
that the Taipei Times is a Taiwan-oriented newspaper devoted to
providing accurate information to the local and foreign communities
in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The Liberty Times has been the most widely read newspaper on the
island for three consecutive years, Lin said, adding that it is his
wish that the Taipei Times will also become the most authoritative
and trusted English-language newspaper in the Asia-Pacific region.</P>
      <P>The newborn English-language daily is also aimed at enhancing the
island's profile among international readers, Lin said, adding that
the motto of the Taipei Times is "bringing Taiwan to the world, and
the world to Taiwan."</P>
      <P>The newspaper not only has the most comprehensive local reporting
on the island, but also the most extensive and informative
international coverage, thanks to a team of fine editors, reporters
and production people, he said.</P>
      <P>President Lee lauded the launch of the Taipei Times, saying it
marked a milestone in the development of an international press in
Taiwan. He noted the importance of press freedom, saying that without
it, there would be no true democracy.</P>
      <P>The Taipei Times will help present the Republic of China's
achievements to the international community, and make Taiwan's voice
heard across the world, Lee said.</P>
      <P>Lien pointed out that many international press publications, such
as The Asian Wall Street Journal, The International Herald Tribune
and 10 Japanese newspapers, have established operations in Taiwan
recently, which shows the ROC's growing importance in the world
community.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's production, transportation and financial sectors are
already fully developed and can function as parts of an Asia-Pacific
Regional Operations Center, Lien said, adding that with the
publication of the Taipei Times, the ROC has taken another step
toward becoming a regional media center as well.</P>
      <P>The Taipei Times serves an important role in the transmission of
up-to-date information, as well as cultural exchanges between Taiwan
and the world, Lien said, adding that the daily's stance of "Taiwan
first" will make the island's voice heard throughout the global
community.</P>
      <P>The premier also lauded the Taipei Times for seeking to help the
world understand Taiwan. He said it is natural for people to read The
New York Times in New York City, and now Taiwan finally has an
international-caliber daily to compete with the international press.</P>
      <P>Other attendees of the newspaper's inauguration party included
representatives of all political parties, members of the local and
foreign press, and noted figures in the entertainment business.</P>

    <HEADLINE>JAPANESE, EUROPEAN GROUPS VIE FOR HIGH-SPEED RAILWAY ELECTRIC SYSTEM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  15 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Two foreign consortia, one from Japan and
the other from Europe, will formally vie for the US$2.44 billion
contract to provide the electric engineering system for Taiwan's
high-speed railway.</P>
      <P>Both the European consortium Eurotrain and the Japanese
consortium presented their bids for the contract to Taiwan
High-Speed Railway Corp. (THSRC) on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Eurotrain is composed of Germany's Siemens Group and France's
Alston Group, while the Japanese consortium comprises Mitsui Group,
Mitsubishi Heavy Industry Co., Toshiba and Kawasaki Heavy Industry
Co.</P>
      <P>THSRC Chairwoman Nita Ing said the top principles for selecting
the new railway's electric engineering system are "meeting Taiwan's
demand and the ROC government's requirements."</P>
      <P>THSRC, which is formed by a group of local business and
industrial companies, won the contract in 1998 to build the island's
first high-speed railway under a BOT (build-operate-transfer)
formula.</P>
      <P>The company originally planned to use a French-German (or
TGV-ICE) mixed electric engineering system. As the two European
companies have no intention to invest in construction of Taiwan's
high-speed rail system, THSRC has decided to hold an open tender to
select the most suitable supplier of the electric engineering
system.</P>
      <P>Ing said changes in the electric engineering system is not
expected to have a great impact on the railway's civil construction.</P>
      <P>The Japanese consortium once joined with a group of local
companies to vie for the contract to build the NT$400 billion
high-speed railway. The Taiwan-Japanese consortium was disbanded
after losing the bid to THSRC.</P>
      <P>The newly formed Japanese consortium reportedly has cut the
price by 20 to 30 percent from its previous offer and the Japanese
government has also promised to offer a huge loan for the electric
engineering equipment. All these terms have helped sharpened the
Japanese consortium's competitive edge to win the contract.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the Japanese consortium said its Shinkansen system,
which has been used in Japan for many decades and has never had any
accidents, is the safest high-speed rail system in the world.</P>

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Finance Minister Paul Chiu said on Tuesday
that his ministry has filed a lawsuit with prosecution authorities
against the Kaohsiung City Government for illegally issuing public
lottery tickets.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a Kuomintang legislative caucus meeting, Chiu also
said that some Finance Ministry officials have left for the southern
port city to gather evidence of how the lottery is being run.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the central government will take necessary
measures to stop illegal issuance and marketing of public lotteries
by local government authorities in compliance with the Criminal Code,
Chiu said that the Finance Ministry has already notified the
Kaohsiung City Government and its contractor who printed the tickets
that they face prosecution.</P>
      <P>Ignoring a central government ban, the Kaohsiung City Government
kicked off its test run of a public lottery on Monday, issuing
240,000 scratch-and-win tickets to raise funds for social welfare
programs for underprivileged citizens.</P>
      <P>The move has stirred up opposition from the central government,
which insists that lottery issuance by local authorities must first
obtain central government approval.</P>
      <P>Regarding the allocation of the proceeds of the lotteries, Vice
Finance Minister Wang Rong-jou said that at least 50 percent of the
revenue should be used to carry out social welfare programs for
minorities, but a detailed allocation must be worked out among the
central and local governments, he added.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Finance (MOF) on Tuesday
approved an application from LGT Bank in Liechtenstein
Aktiengesellschaft (LBLA) to set up a representative office in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>An MOF Bureau of Monetary Affairs (BMA) spokesman said that with
the establishment of the bank's Taipei bureau, there will be 27
foreign banks which have set up representative offices in Taiwan, and
16 which have set up branch offices or bureaus.</P>
      <P>The LBLA, the largest bank in the Principality of Liechtenstein,
was established in 1920. According to the 1998 July issue of Bankers'
magazine, the bank's total assets amounted to US$7.17 billion, and
the total amount of its capital was US$670 million, making it the
408th-largest bank in the world.</P>
      <P>The bank is a subsidiary of the Liechtenstein Global Trust
Aktiengesellshaft, which specializes in assets management, investment
consultation and portfolio management. It currently owns over US$1
billion of capital in Asia.</P>
      <P>According to the BMA, several foreign financial institutions have
adjusted or withdrawn their operations from Taiwan due to their
global management policies. However, that does not mean that foreign

      <P>Recent diplomatic events have served to
isolate mainland China and bring Taiwan to the fore, particularly in
Europe, according to a leading Australian newspaper.</P>
      <P>In a dispatch from Hong Kong, Australian Financial Review

were in Taipei last week. That same week Taiwan pledged US$300

    <HEADLINE>NOODLE MERGER FALLS THROUGH IN FAVOR OF JAPANESE COMPANY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  15  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A high-profile merger of Taiwan's food
giant President Enterprises with the Hong Kong-listed Tingyi Holding
Corp. was aborted on Tuesday when Tingyi, producer of the
biggest-selling instant noodles in mainland China, forged a
cooperation accord with a Japanese manufacturer.</P>
      <P>Tingyi, a subsidiary of the Taiwan-based Ting Hsin Co., and
producer of Master Kang instant noodles, better known in the mainland
as Kangshihfu convenient noodles, signed an agreement with Sanyo
Foods, allowing the Japanese company to own 33.14 percent of Tingyi's
shares at a cost of US$143 million.</P>
      <P>Sanyo Foods is a veteran noodle manufacturer whose annual
turnover reached 80 billion Japanese yen in 1998. Sanyo is currently
the second-largest instant noodle maker in Japan, and its noodles,
mainly marketed under the brand name "Sapporo Ichiban," dominate the
Japanese market.</P>
      <P>In addition to making instant noodles, Sanyo also has golf
courses and hotels in Japan.</P>
      <P>Sanyo's buying into Tingyi is viewed as a "win win" development,
giving a shot in the arm for Sanyo in its bid to explore mainland
China's huge instant noodle market with Tingyi's 1,450 distribution
centers across the mainland, while instantly relieving Tingyi of its
financial strain.</P>
      <P>Tingyi currently operates 12 production hubs in mainland China.
Ting Hsin entered the mainland market in 1989 with start-up capital
of just a few million new Taiwan dollars, but has seen its capital
grow to more than NT$32 billion (nearly US$1 billion) over the past
10 years.</P>
      <P>Although its annual sales have reached over NT$20 billion (US$612
million) in previous years, Ting Hsin's turnover has been declining
in recent years due to growing competition and too-rapid
diversification of its business operations.</P>
      <P>After nearly one year of talks, President Enterprises and Ting
Hsin had still failed to seal a merger accord, mainly because the two
companies could not reach a consensus on the price of the 33 percent
stake of shares that Tingyi was to have sold to President.</P>
      <P>President Enterprises Chairman Kao Chin-yen said he felt sorry
about the failure of the merger, but added that the setback will not
adversely affect President Enterprises' determination to further
crack open the food market of mainland China. Currently, President
instant noodles are the second-biggest sellers in the mainland.</P>
      <P>President, which first cut into the mainland Chinese market in
1992, has increased its investment capital there to US$270 million,
with the number of production plants around the country surging to
15.</P>

(By M.J. Tzou and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A French monthly magazine in its latest
issue praised Taiwan for extending cash and humanitarian aid to help
Macedonia in its efforts to resettle refugees from Kosovo.</P>
      <P>The Economic, Labor and Social Chronicle said both sides of the
Taiwan Strait have played a role in the Kosovo conflict -- mainland
China explicitly showed support for Yugoslavian President Slobodan
Milosevic, while Taiwan silently dispatched cash aid, relief goods
and medical teams to help the Kosovar refugees.</P>
      <P>However, it said, Taiwan's aid to the Kosovar refugees is not
well known to the rest of the world.</P>
      <P>The monthly noted that Beijing supported Milosevic's ethnic
cleansing movement which has driven ethnic Albanians into refugee
camps in neighboring countries, which it said is understandable
because the Chinese rulers did the same to the Tibetan people.</P>
      <P>But the people and government of the Republic of China, a
peace-loving full-fledged democracy, offered to provide humanitarian
aid to Macedonia, first by speeding US$2 million-worth of cash, food,
medicine and other relief goods to the Kosovar refugees, and
following this with another commitment of US$300 million in aid to
refugee settlement efforts and reconstruction programs.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, donation drives were launched for the cause of helping
the Kosovar refugees, the monthly continued, while a 30-member
medical team from Taiwan was sent to the Kosovo-Macedonia border
where they built a field hospital to accommodate the refugees, it
added.</P>
      <P>The magazine said Macedonia's decision to establish formal
diplomatic relations with the Republic of China was right, and urged
the Macedonian government and people to treasure the invaluable
friendship that Taiwan has shown to them.</P>

      <P>A list compiled by the department designates all mainland Chinese
women older than 20 and all men between 20 and 39 or over 60 as
likely to overstay their visas, the Australian daily reported.</P>
      <P>The department has devised a system involving locally accredited

agents allowed to organize tours to Australia will lose their

Ecuador, El Salvador, Ethiopia, Laos, Lithuania, the Russian

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's National Security Bureau (NSB)
infuriated local electronic manufacturers on Tuesday by alleging that
Beijing has gained control of a well-known Taiwan computer company
through a Taiwan electronics firm which also operates in mainland
China.</P>
      <P>The NSB said, without mentioning names, that Beijing has pumped
more than NT$1 billion (US$30.76 million) into the Taiwan bourse
through the firm to take a controlling stake in the listed Taiwan
computer company.</P>
      <P>The ploy behind Beijing's venture is to create a collapse of
stock prices before the island's 2000 presidential election, and to
trigger another round of financial crisis on the island, according to
the NSB allegation.</P>
      <P>The NSB instructed the Investigative Bureau to probe the case
after receiving information from the Military Intelligence Bureau
which is charged with collecting information on mainland China.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan company in mainland China, with a capitalization of
NT$100 million, raised the Military Intelligence Bureau's suspicions
when it came up with NT$1 billion to take over a company much bigger
than itself, said the NSB.</P>
      <P>An investigation by the Investigative Bureau revealed that
Beijing is the creditor who financed the deal, said the NSB.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's law enforcement authorities routinely warn of disruptive
ploys by Beijing before elections, but rarely have they gone so far
as to take any espionage case before the court.</P>
      <P>Later in the day, a stunned local electronic industry urged the
(NSB) to take action against the company in question rather than make
unsubstantiated accusations.</P>
      <P>Empty rhetoric without action will only panic the market and lead
to a disaster without Beijing actually having to lift a finger, said
industry representatives.</P>
      <P>Many local electronic firms have shifted their plants to mainland
China, and have been justifiably infuriated by the NSB's
unsubstantiated accusation which casts suspicion on all of them.</P>

Ambeno, for example, to spend much of his 3 billion rupiah allocation
from President B.J. Habibie's Social Safety Net program in support of
the autonomy cause.</P>
      <P>Horta, who has been in exile abroad, including Australia for 23
years, has complained to the United Nations about Indonesia's refusal
to allow him and the pro-independence leader Xanana Gusmao to
campaign in East Timor in July, ahead of the August autonomy ballot.</P>
      <P>The daily quoted diplomats and political analysts as saying that
the documents, if authenticated, indicate a misuse of international
aid from countries such as Australia, which have given substantial
amounts to help ease Indonesia's financial crisis. Australia has
given Indonesia over US$30 million.</P>
      <P>Horta said the UN should immediately send a peacekeeping force
to East Timor so that the Timorese can vote without fear or
intimidation.

    <HEADLINE>ANOTHER 67 HEAD OF CATTLE SLAUGHTERED ON KINMEN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  15  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Another 67 head of cattle suspected of being
affected with foot and mouth disease (FMD), were destroyed on the
island of Kinmen on Tuesday, bringing the number of cattle
slaughtered on the island to 132 since Saturday.</P>
      <P>About 30 veterinarians and health officials arrived at the Shao
She-fu Ranch early on Tuesday, where some of the 58 bulls tested
positive for FMD virus, although none of them were displaying
symptoms.</P>
      <P>The veterinarians took blood and saliva samples before injecting
the animals with lethal doses of barbiturate.</P>
      <P>The carcasses were buried in a waterproof fabric-lined pit on the
ranch, although the process was disrupted briefly by a group of local
residents who protested over the mass grave which they said would
contaminate the environment and pose a health risk.</P>
      <P>They dispersed after being assured by officials that the dead
animals will not contaminate the environment.</P>
      <P>After burying the cattle, the health officials erected a notice
at the site forbidding any opening up of the ground for any reason
within three years.</P>
      <P>They then cordoned off the ranch and sanitized it before leaving
to repeat the process at the Chen Cheng-tsai Ranch, where nine bulls
were put to death.</P>
      <P>The two ranches were a stone's throw from the Hsin Yao-chih Ranch
where 65 head of cattle were slaughtered on Saturday after they were
found to be infected with FMD.</P>
      <P>Health officials will continue testing at other cattle ranches in
the vicinity of the three affected ones, in an attempt to eliminate
the disease.</P>
      <P>Kinmen, a Taiwan-controlled front line island about 150 nautical
miles to the west of southern Taiwan's Kaohsiung City, has not been
declared an FMD-affected area thus far because of the limited number
of cases found, according to officials.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AUSTRALIAN IOC MEMBER FORCED TO RESIGN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,   June  15  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia's senior member of the
International Olympic Committee (IOC) has resigned from the board of
the Sydney Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games (SOCOG) after
being reprimanded by the IOC for "serious negligence" involving a
series of bribery scandals.</P>
      <P>Phil Coles, 67, tendered his resignation from the SOCOG board on
Monday immediately after the IOC reprimanded him for failing to
ensure that revealing dossiers written by himself and his partner --
Patricia Rosenrock -- about IOC members did not go outside the Sydney

      <P>IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch had rejected Coles'
last-minute appeal to remain on the SOCOG job. Samaranch claimed the
charges that Coles accepted travel and jewelry from the Salt Lake

      <P>Coles will be allowed to keep his IOC job, but he will lose a
second salary of nearly US$100,000 a year from the Australian Olympic

In addition, he will be suspended from IOC membership for two years.

    <HEADLINE>MAINLAND STOWAWAYS TAKE ILAN POLICE OFFICERS HOSTAGE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   June  16  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Illegal mainland Chinese immigrants
detained in the eastern city of Ilan were still holding two detention
police officers hostage as of noon Wednesday, demanding early
repatriation and a televised live dialogue with Taiwan officials.</P>
      <P>The mainland stowaways took officers Lu Chuan-fang and Lin
Hu-shih hostage around 10 p.m. Tuesday. The act capped a day of
prisoner unrest amid an outbreak of a mysterious disease that claimed
three lives there and caused nine others to be hospitalized.</P>
      <P>Ilan Magistrate Liu Sho-cheng met with the detainees in the small
hours of Wednesday, though he failed to persuade the 373 mainland
stowaways at the Ilan Detention Center to release the police
officers.</P>
      <P>More than 100 members of a crack police force entered the
detention center around 8:30 Wednesday morning and managed to
disperse more than 100 detainees who were occupying first-floor rooms
at the center.</P>
      <P>As of 1 p.m. Wednesday, 173 detainees were continuing a standoff
with police on the second floor of the center, with the two police
officers still in the detainees' hands.</P>
      <P>Wu An-chia, vice chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC),
the top Taiwan government agency in charge of mainland Chinese
affairs, sped to the eastern coastal city early Wednesday to calm the
uproar and get a better understanding of the situation.</P>
      <P>Wu was told by the detainees that six to 10 detainee
representatives would be selected later in the day to meet with
officials from the quasi-official Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF)
in front of television cameras for talks on their early repatriation
and on their health problems.</P>
      <P>SEF Vice Chairman and Secretary-General Shi Hwei-yow was also
heading from Taipei to Ilan Wednesday to help settle the conflict. He
was expected to arrive at the center around 2 p.m.</P>
      <P>Shi, one of the most seasoned Taiwan negotiators with mainland
authorities, urged Beijing to establish a detention center in Xiamen,
Fujian province, to accommodate the stowaways so as to help
accelerate the repatriation of the illegal mainland immigrants.</P>
      <P>He asked the mainland authorities to share the costs of the
repatriation and detention of the illegal immigrants, saying the
Republic of China government has spent NT$600 million (US$18.4
million) at the Ilan Detention Center alone on accommodations,
repatriation and relevant affairs.</P>
      <P>In the absence of cooperation from the mainland authorities,
illegal immigrants stay in Taiwan detention centers for an average of
five months before being repatriated, and each year about 5,000
illegal mainland immigrants are caught by Taiwan police, according to
SEF tallies.</P>
      <P>In addition, Shi said it is SEF's hope that affairs surrounding
the repatriation of mainland hijackers, illegal immigrants and other
mainland convicts will be included in talks with the mainland when
SEF Deputy Secretary-General Jan Jyh-horng visits Beijing on June 27
to discuss the forthcoming visit to Taiwan by the mainland's top
negotiator, Wang Daohan, later this year.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, MAC Chairman Su Chi bemoaned Beijing's reluctance to
cooperate with Taipei on the stowaway repatriation issue, saying that
Taiwan is highly sympathetic toward the illegal immigrants, but it
needs cooperation from the Beijing authorities to accelerate
repatriation efforts.</P>
      <P>Besides the Ilan Detention Center, there are two other similar
centers located in Hsinchu in northern Taiwan and on the offshore
island of Matsu.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC MORE THAN WILLING TO CONTRIBUTE TO WORLD PEACE: ENVOY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  June  15  (CNA)
(By Jay Chen and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China is more than
willing to contribute to world peace and development and the
well-being of all mankind, ROC Representative to the United States
Stephen Chen said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The de facto ROC ambassador made the statement at a seminar on
the reconstruction of the war-torn Balkan peninsula.</P>
      <P>In his speech, Chen explained in detail a US$300 million aid
package proposed by the ROC government last week for Kosovars.</P>
      <P>Noting that the ROC shares the same political, economic and
humanitarian ideals with all other countries around the world, Chen
said Taiwan looks forward to joining various international relief
programs and providing financial aid and technological assistance to
needed people and developing countries.</P>
      <P>Chen said Taiwan has long forsaken a "zero-sum" stance in
handling disputes with mainland China. "We hope all countries around
the world will follow the example of the United States and maintain
parallel engagements with the two sides of the Taiwan Strait."</P>
      <P>The career diplomat called on major countries around the world
not to reject resources and manpower provided by Taiwan for
international relief programs nor ignore its willingness to
cooperate with other countries in promoting global stability,
prosperity and democratic reforms.</P>
      <P>Chen said the ROC has offered humanitarian aid to Kosovar
refugees in Macedonia, including offering various relief goods
and free medical services. In the past four decades, he said, the
ROC has assisted many developing countries in economic development
through agricultural and fishery technological cooperation.</P>
      <P>The one-day seminar was sponsored by the Center for
Reconstruction and Development. Ambassadors to the United States
from many Balkan countries, including Macedonia, Albanian, Bosnia,
Bulgaria and Greece, the representative of the provisional Kosovo
government, and officials from the European Union, the World Bank and
other international relief organizations also attended the seminar.</P>
      <P>Dino Asanaj, the Kosovo interim government stationed in the
United States, said about 1,000 villages in the Yugoslav province of
Kosovo are no longer suitable for living because of destruction
by Serbs.</P>
      <P>Asanaj said the Kosovo interim government appreciates the ROC's
aid offer. "We hope to forge contacts with Taiwan authorities to
discuss concrete relief measures," he said, adding that his office
in New York has not had any contact with the ROC's representative
office in the United States.</P>
      <P>The ROC's aid offer was announced by President Lee Teng-hui on
June 7, and highlights of the package include:</P>
      <P>-- Emergency support with food, shelter, medical care and
education for the Kosovar refugees who are currently living in exile
countries neighboring Yugoslavia's Kosovo Province.</P>
      <P>-- Short-term accommodation for some of the refugees in Taiwan,
with opportunities for job training in order to better equip them for
the restoration of their homeland upon their return.</P>
      <P>-- Support for the rehabilitation of Kosovo in coordination with
international recovery programs.</P>

      <P>Beijing has played down the decision to
establish a security dialogue mechanism between mainland China and
India during the ongoing visit of Union External Affairs Minister
Jaswant Singh of India to Beijing, a New Delhi-based English daily
reported from Beijing Tuesday afternoon.</P>
      <P>In response to Singh's statement on Monday that India and
mainland China have agreed to establish a security dialogue mechanism
between the two Asian states, Zhang Qiyue, Beijing's foreign ministry
spokeswoman, said she could not comment on the issue, according to

      <P>Zhang later said she had no information on the proposed security
dialogue between mainland China and India, the newspaper added.</P>
      <P>Singh who arrived in Beijing Monday for a three-day visit, told
Indian reporters Monday in Beijing that the security dialogue would
be held at "an appropriate level" and that the details would be
chalked out by the foreign ministers of the two sides.</P>
      <P>Singh said the proposed security dialogue with Beijing still had
to be fleshed out, however, Indian officials believed that its focus
is likely to be largely bilateral.</P>
      <P>According to the English daily, while proposing a security
dialogue with India, the mainland Chinese foreign minister apparently
told his Indian counterpart that the two neighbors needed to discuss

(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A ranking Quebec official said independence
will continue to be a priority for Quebecers over the next 25 years,
as Quebec's economic destiny is intimately linked to its political
destiny.</P>
      <P>Bernard Landry, deputy premier and minister of finance of Quebec,

key decisions are made, we will continue paying a very heavy price."</P>
      <P>In an interview appearing in the current issue of Forces -- a
Quebec economic, social and cultural quarterly -- Landry pointed out
that globalization calls for supranational interventions, but "only
nations are called to supranational forums."</P>
      <P>Luxembourg will be there; so will Chile and the Central African
Republic, he said. "But if Quebec is not there, people from Ottawa
claiming to represent us will be," he added.</P>
      <P>He acknowledged that federal officials "will be right" sometimes,
but at others times, "they will simply be advocating for the heart of
Canada," he said, referring to Ontario, Canada's largest province in
terms of population.</P>
      <P>As long as Quebec is merely a province, it will not be at those
forums, he said. "If this continues over the next 25 years, it will
be a tragedy for Quebec."</P>
      <P>This is the most powerful economic argument that exists in favor
of Quebec's sovereignty, Landry emphasized.</P>

    <DATELINE>Canberra,  June 16 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>About 80 ethnic Albanian refugees taking
temporary shelter in Australia have refused to stay at former army
barracks and instead bedded down in buses for the second consecutive
night on Tuesday, because of poor accommodations at Singleton,
northwest of Sydney.</P>
      <P>They said the Australian army barracks were no better than the
camps they had previously stayed at in Macedonia, falling short of
their expectations for better shelter in Australia.</P>
      <P>The Albanian refugees said the facilities are lacking heat, and
toilets are hundreds of meters away from where they are staying
within the Singleton barracks. In addition, they also complained
about the presence of wild animals, including snakes and kangaroos.</P>

the refugees back to Sydney's East Hills army barracks. In response
to some refugees floating the idea of going home, Ruddock indicated
the refugees would be free to go, provided they paid their own

    <TEXT>
      <P>Inaction among Australia's trading
partners in fixing the millennium bug could trigger major problems
for Australian industries, with financial service firms expected to
suffer the most, according to the Australian Bureau of Agriculture
Resources and Economics (ABARE).</P>
      <P>The ABARE on Tuesday released a report in which it said that
two-thirds of companies in mainland China, Indonesia and the
Philippines will suffer from critical systems failures. Those
countries are all Australia's trading partners.</P>
      <P>The report indicated the United States and Australia are rated as
the best in their preparations for Y2K. Japan -- Australia's No. 1
trading partner -- is tied with Taiwan, South Korea, New Zealand,
Singapore and Thailand as second best in their readiness to solve the
Y2K problem.</P>

(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australian Foreign Minister Alexander
Downer has flagged a possible delay of the scheduled Aug. 8 ballot in
East Timor and pledged additional logistical support for the UN
mission because of continuing intimidation by pro-Indonesian militia
in the territory.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Indonesian army is expected to be the big winner
from the country's first democratic election in 44 years because it
appears set to hold the balance of power in a hung parliament,
according to Australian media reports.</P>
      <P>Downer told Australian journalists in New York that he discussed
the matter with UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan, and he said
Australia wanted the ballot to go ahead on Aug. 8, though it was even
more important that people be able to vote without being harassed.</P>
      <P>"We very much hope it will occur, but it has to be a free and
fair ballot ... otherwise, (it) would not take forward the task of
achieving a solution for East Timor," he said.</P>
      <P>Downer is floating a delay of "a couple of weeks" for the ballot
if militia harassment continues.</P>
      <P>Major Australian newspapers reported on Wednesday that although
Megawati Sukarnoputri's PDI-P is still leading in the vote count, it
will likely win fewer than 160 seats in the 500-seat parliament.</P>
      <P>If she wants to win the presidential election in November, she
has to win the support of army, which holds an appointed 38 seats in
addition to cooperating with the moderate Muslim PKB Party, which is
expected to win 51 seats, according to a calculation by The
Australian Financial Review.</P>
      <P>If she could win support from Amien Rais' party, PAN, then she
would gain 33 additional seats, the daily reported.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>More than 110 scholars and experts from
Taiwan, along with 165 academic elite of Chinese descent living in
North America, are to gather in Washington in early July for a
three-day academic seminar.</P>
      <P>The 6th North American Chinese Academic Seminar is slated to open
on July 2, with participants divided into 11 groups to release 181
theses, 69 of which will be from Taiwan, according to Dr. Lee
Wu-lang, chief convenor of the preparatory committee for the seminar.</P>
      <P>Lee predicted that the upcoming seminar will be three times
larger in scale than similar government-sponsored national
development seminars held in Taiwan, and added that the Washington
seminar will be the largest and highest-caliber Chinese academic
conference in the United States.</P>
      <P>Lee, who works at the US Department of Treasury, said the seminar
is aimed at helping the Taiwan authorities in a variety of fields.
Gathering the collective wisdom of the attending academicians, Lee
said, can contribute to Taiwan's national development.</P>
      <P>Other sources in the preparatory committee said several
ministerial-level Taiwan officials, including Finance Minister Paul
Chiu and Chairman Su Chi of the Mainland Affairs Council, will attend
the seminar, some of whom will be invited to speak.</P>
      <P>The seminar will center on challenges and tasks facing the
Republic of China in the approach of the 21st century.</P>
      <P>The theses presented will cover a range of topics including
Taiwan's foreign and cross-Taiwan Strait relations; the judicial
system; reforms of the educational systems; economic development;
finance and monetary affairs; strategies for science and technology
development; construction and management of transportation systems;
health care; environmental protection; labor-related policy and
reform; and agricultural development.</P>
      <P>The papers will be discussed, and there will also be conferences
on high-tech investment and overseas Chinese affairs.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Council for Economic
Planning and Development (CEPD) will take part in all aspects of
Taiwan's first high-speed railway project, including discussions on a
loan agreement, CEPD Chairman P.K. Chiang said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Chiang met at a breakfast meeting with Nita Ing, chairman of the
Taiwan High-Speed railway Corp. (THSRC), a private business and
industry consortium which won the contract last year to build the
high-speed railway system, to clear up recent reports that cast doubt
on THSRC's ability to complete the project by June 2003 as scheduled.</P>
      <P>According to the reports, Ing had said that the THSRC would
consider giving up the contract if the loan agreement could not
reached in the near future.</P>
      <P>Chiang said he will personally preside over meetings of a
CEPD-sponsored supra-ministerial task force on the high-speed railway
development project, adding that if the THSRC has any doubts or
difficulties regarding loan acquisition and other related issues, the
company should approach him for a possible solution, rather than
making "improper complaints."</P>
      <P>In the future, he said, relevant CEPD officials will take part in
all discussions regarding loan agreements, and the meetings will also
be attended by officials from the Ministry of Transportation and
Telecommunications, the THSRC, and the bank consortium.</P>
      <P>In addition, the CEPD high-speed railway task force will be
involved in all discussions on other development and relevant issues
concerning the project, Taiwan's first BOT (build-operate-transfer)
endeavor, to ensure the smooth running of the multi-billion dollar
project, Chiang noted.</P>
      <P>He stressed the importance of exercising the "spirit of
partnership" by all parties involved in the project, adding that the
CEPD and other relevant government agencies are actually partners in
the project rather than supervisors.</P>
      <P>The US$13 billion railway is expected to shuttle passengers from
Taipei in the north of the island to the southern port city of
Kaohsiung in just 90 minutes, at a maximum speed of 300 kilometers
per hour.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Stock trading on the Internet has become
the most popular type of e-mail commerce in Taiwan, with transaction
amounts and the number of traders increasing at an astounding rate.</P>
      <P>Currently, more than 40 local stocks and securities companies
have started providing Internet stock trading services to over
130,000 account holders, a huge jump from the few thousand people who
started using the system in July 1997, when the Tah Hsin Securities
Co. took the lead in introducing the new trading method.</P>
      <P>Over 8,000 Tah Hsin customers now conduct stock trading via the
Internet, with monthly transactions topping NT$3 billion, a 30-fold
increase from two years ago. The level of business is approaching
that of a conventional trading branch, a sign that Internet stock
trading has great growth potential in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>At the same time, the overall monthly amount of stock
transactions through the Internet across Taiwan jumped from the NT$1
billion level in January to more than NT$50 billion (US$1.5 billion)
in April, for a daily average of around NT$2 billion per day. At this
pace, the daily transaction figure is expected to top the NT$10
billion mark by the end of this year.</P>
      <P>As purchases through the Internet can help save a great deal on
personnel spending, many local large stocks and securities firms,
including China Securities Co., Ltd., Jih Sun Securities Co., Ltd.,
Polaris Securities Co., Ltd., Kong Cheng Securities Investment
Consulting Co., and Core Pacific Securities Investment Consulting
Co., Ltd., are preparing to promote Internet trading coupled with
extra incentives such as lowering commission charges and providing
financial management information.</P>
      <P>Although the amount of Taiwan's Internet stock trading remains
limited compared to the level in the United States, the trading
method is destined to become a local trend as Taiwan's "Internet

      <P>First-time violators of Taiwan's drunken

community service in an effort to curb rampant drunken driving,
sources from the Legislative Yuan said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan's Transportation Committee on Wednesday

    <HEADLINE>BILL FOR LOWER IMPORT TARIFFS ON 750 ITEMS PASSED BY LEGISLATURE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  16  (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Finance Committee of the Legislative
Yuan on Wednesday examined and passed a draft amendment to the
customs' import tariff statute, covering up to 750 products.</P>
      <P>The move, part of Taiwan's efforts to join the World Trade
Organization (WTO), will see the average tariff rate after revision
decreased to 8.14 percent from the previous 8.22 percent. As a
result, the government's total tax revenue is expected to drop by
NT$3.92 billion annually.</P>
      <P>To implement Taiwan's promises to the US and Canada regarding
Taiwan's access to the world trade regulatory body, the Ministry of
Finance (MOF) listed 750 products whose import tariffs have to be
amended. Among the listed commodities, agricultural products account
for 125 items, while industrial products account for 625 items.</P>
      <P>MOF Vice Minister Yen Ching-chang noted that in addition to the
reduction of tariffs on imported agricultural and industrial raw
materials, products whose import tariffs are unreasonably structured
will also be examined and revised. The measures should ensure an
improved investment environment, he said.</P>
      <P>In the agricultural products sector, a total of 1,300 items are
listed under the current customs statute as subject to import tax at
an average tariff of 20.02 percent, Yen indicated.</P>
      <P>However, he added that since just 125 of these products have been
listed in the amendment, most of which are in any case not produced
domestically, the forthcoming tariff decrease is not expected to harm
Taiwan's agricultural development.</P>

    <DATELINE>Matsu,  June 16 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan on Wednesday repatriated 163 illegal
mainland Chinese immigrants from its front-line defense outpost of
Matsu, two days before the Dragon Boat Festival, a major holiday in
the Chinese calendar.</P>
      <P>Hsu Cheng-chieh, director of the Matsu detention center for
illegal immigrants, said that all those repatriated -- 145 men and 18
women -- were in good health.</P>
      <P>Hsu said the center originally planned to repatriate only 140
people, but in view of the Dragon Boat Festival, he said he suggested
to mainland Chinese Red Cross Society officials that the number be
increased.</P>
      <P>After bilateral consultations, the mainland finally agreed to
take back the additional 18 illegal immigrants.</P>
      <P>The released immigrants began boarding the ferry boat Haixia for
their home-bound voyage at around 10 a.m. All of them looked happy to
be going home after having been detained at the Matsu center for
periods of between several months to more than a year.</P>
      <P>According to the Kinmen Agreement signed by the Red Cross
societies on both sides of the Taiwan Strait in 1991, mainland China
must take back seized illegal mainland immigrants within 20 days of
their capture, but it has never abided by that regulation, and last
year took back just four batches of detained illegal immigrants,
totaling slightly more than 400 people.</P>
      <P>More than 1,000 are still awaiting repatriation in the Matsu
center and two similar detention facilities in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to statistics compiled by the Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC), which charts Taiwan's policy toward mainland China, Taiwan
seizes an average of 5,000 illegal mainland immigrants annually, each
of which has to stay in Taiwan for an average of 130 days before
mainland authorities decide to take them back.</P>
      <P>MAC Chairman Su Chi said on Wednesday that illegal mainland
immigrants have become a heavy financial burden, adding that Taiwan
has spent over NT$600 million providing food, clothing and shelter
for them.</P>
      <P>Official tallies show that some 36,700 illegal mainland
immigrants have been repatriated since 1987 when Taiwan opened its
doors to cross-strait civilian exchanges.</P>
      <P>Wednesday's repatriation followed reports that three detainees in
the Ilan detention center in northeastern Taiwan had died from an
unknown disease since the beginning of this year, and that nine
others have been hospitalized. The outbreak has caused unrest among
the detainees and prompted them to take two police officers hostage
on Tuesday night. The hostage drama was still unfolding as of press

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Two cattle ranches in the
southern Taiwan county of Tainan have been barred from selling or
moving their livestock off their farms, local animal disease control
officials said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The Animal Disease Control Department under the Tainan County
Government issued the moving and trading ban after eight head of
cattle raised in the two ranches in Shanhua township tested positive
for foot-and-mouth disease (FMD).</P>
      <P>The discovery has raised concern around the island, especially as
more than 100 head of cattle raised in two ranches on the offshore
front-line island of Kinmen were slaughtered over the past week due
to FMD infection.</P>
      <P>According to county government officials, 29 Kinmen cattle were
shipped to Taiwan in early June, 20 of which were sent to Shanhua
township.</P>
      <P>After Kinmen cattle were confirmed to have been infected with
"type O Kinmen" FMD virus, the Tainan animal disease control
department last week sent officials to cattle ranches located within
three kilometers of the ranch where the Kinmen cattle were housed to
collect blood and saliva samples of the animals for FMD tests.</P>
      <P>Initial examination reports show that eight head of cattle from
two ranches in the township carried high levels of FMD antibodies.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Animal Health Research Institute under the provincial
government said it will conduct further examinations to determine
whether the cattle have really been infected with FMD virus. "The
final examination result will be available in five days' time," said
an institute official.</P>
      <P>If the cattle are confirmed to have been infected with the virus,
county government officials said all cattle raised in the two ranches
will be slaughtered to prevent further spread of the disease.</P>
      <P>Taiwan cattle were last hit by the FMD virus in 1929.</P>
      <P>FMD is an acute, contagious disease that can be spread via air
and infects mainly cloven-hoofed livestock and wild animals. Its
mortality rate is 5 percent, but can rise to 50 percent in young
animals.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's hog farms were hit by an FMD outbreak in 1997,
resulting in the death of 3.85 million pigs and an
estimated financial loss of NT$160 billion.</P>

      <P>Two police officers held hostage by illegal
mainland immigrants at an Ilan detention center for 20 hours were
released unharmed early Wednesday evening.</P>
      <P>After their release the two officers appeared at a press
conference shortly after 6:00 p.m. at the Chinglu detention center,
where 383 illegal mainland immigrants are being held pending
repatriation.</P>
      <P>In answering questions from the press, the officers avoided using
the word of hostage, rather they said they were prevented from
leaving the cell after entering to evaluate an detainee complaining
of illness Tuesday night.</P>
      <P>They said they were not ill-treated and their lives were never in
danger during the 20-hour standoff.</P>
      <P>The detainees rioted Tuesday night after three died and nine more
fell ill from an unknown disease. Most of the detainees are anxious
to return home before the Dragon Boat Festival on Friday.</P>
      <P>They demanded earlier repatriation and staged a hunger strike.</P>
      <P>Two representatives of the detainees appeared at Wednesday's
press conference. They claimed mainland immigrants coming to Taiwan
to seek better lives have never disrupted social order and should not
be treated as criminals.</P>
      <P>The detainees agreed to release the two hostages after Shi
Hwei-yow, secretary general of the Straits Exchange Foundation,
promised during face-to-face negotiations to deport them before June
27.</P>
      <P>Shi also promised at the press conference not to punish those
responsible for the riot and to seek better treatment for the
detainees.</P>
      <P>According to government's statistics, since Taiwan first opened a
detention center for illegal mainland immigrants in 1987, more than
37,000 mainland citizens have been held.</P>
      <P>Although Beijing has promised to process Taiwan inquiries about
the immigrants' identities within 20 days, on average a detainee
stays in the center for 169 days at a cost of NT$17,000 (US$523).
Since 1987 Taiwan taxpayers have spent a total of NT$700 million
(21.67 million) on detaining illegal mainland immigrants.</P>
      <P>About 36,000 detainees have already been deported with

    <DATELINE>Ilan,  June  16  (CNA)
(By Wendy Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China (ROC) health authorities
announced on Wednesday that the illegal mainland Chinese immigrants
at the Chinglu detention center in Ilan county suffering from the
rare rhabdomolysis disease were probably caused by lack of vitamin B1
and long-term malnutrition.</P>
      <P>Department of Health officials also pointed out rhabdomolysis is
not contagious and poses no threat to Taiwan residents.</P>
      <P>After three stowaways died and nine others hospitalized,
detainees held two detention police officers hostage for 20 hours
while demanding early repatriation.</P>
      <P>The quasi-official Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) Tuesday
informed its mainland counterpart, the Association for Relations
Across the Strait (ARATS) that two detainees, Chen Guosheng and Hsieh
Zhungfeng died of rhabdomyolysis on June 7 and 13, respectively.</P>
      <P>DOH Bureau of Communicable Disease Control (BCDC) Director Tu
Hsing-che pointed out in an interview Wednesday that the DOH has sent
a team of epidemiologists to Ilan to perform health chedkup on the
detainees. The DOH has consulted with medical experts from the
National Taiwan University and the Veteran's Hospital as well, Tu
said.</P>
      <P>According to the medical group, rhabdomyolysis is caused by a
lack of vitamin B1 intake and long-term malnutrition, he pointed out.</P>
      <P>While the possibility of the disease causing an epidemic has
been lowered, Tu said, the root cause of the disease remains to be
discovered by medical experts.</P>
      <P>As for the condition of the 11 hospitalized stowaways, Tu said
they have improved considerably after medical treatment.</P>
      <P>Tu also pointed out after a medical survey was conducted among the
171 mainlanders at the Ilan detention center, it was discovered that
20 reported numbness in their lower limbs, a symptom of long-term
malnutrition.</P>
      <P>Tu said the DOH has demanded local health authorities step up
isolation measures on hospitalized patients, in addition to
sterilizing the detention center.</P>
      <P>The DOH also suggested that the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC)
continue inspecting illegal mainland immigrants to prevent epidemics
from entering Taiwan.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,    June    16    (CNA)
(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislative Yuan (Cabinet)
Secretary-General Hsieh Shen-shan said on Wednesday that the
government firmly opposes the "gambling clause" passed by the
Legislative Yuan Tuesday night.</P>
      <P>The "gambling clause" allows, with the approval of supervising
institutions, the issuance of lottery tickets for
internationally-recognized car racing, horse racing, boat racing
events as well as special public lottery tickets.</P>
      <P>But Hsieh stated that the Cabinet's position of opposing the
issuance of international lotteries is firm, as it is impossible to
issue such lotteries in Taiwan under the present circumstances.</P>
      <P>The "gambling clause" was written into an amendment to the public
lottery statute and railroaded through the legislature with the
support of Kuomintang legislators.</P>
      <P>The session was boycotted by legislators from the Democratic
Progressive Party and the New Party, the two major opposition
parties.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said that the Cabinet will not try to reverse the "gambling
clause" in the Legislative Yuan, but will also not formulate relevant
regulations for its implementation, letting it become a "dead
clause."</P>
      <P>It is understood that during lottery issue debate, the Cabinet
indicated its stiff opposition to including a "gambling clause" into
the amendment.</P>
      <P>Following the passage of the clause, Premier Vincent Siew
reiterated the Cabinet's stance when he met with Legislative Yuan
President Wang Jin-pyng and Vice President Yao Eng-chi after a KMT

    <HEADLINE>FTC RULES 1ST CASE OF RICE WINE HOARDING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  16  (CNA)
(By David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Fair Trade Commission
(FTC) on Wednesday decided to fine a dealer of Taiwan Tobacco and
Wine Board (TTWB) NT$1.2 million for hoarding a large quantity of
rice wine.</P>
      <P>The FTC ruled that Yi Shun Hang in May had illegally hoarded rice
wine, a traditional necessity goods in Taiwan, used in cooking.</P>
      <P>It was the first fine imposed by the FTC on a TTWB dealer since
the hoarding of rice wine began a few months ago.</P>
      <P>According to data recently sent to the FTC by the TTWB, Yi Shun
Hang hoarded 26,180 bottles of rice wine in May, far exceeding the
minimum stock of 5,000 bottles.</P>
      <P>Liu Tzong-rong, vice chairman of the FTC, said because rice wine
is a necessity good, hoarding adversely effects the market mechanism.
Hoarding also causes an imbalance of supply and demand and violates
the law governing equal trade.</P>
      <P>The FTC indicated that the price of rice wine had bulged to NT$65
per bottle in May, from its original price of NT$25. The NT$40
surcharge on the 21,000 bottles would bring Yi Shun Hang an illegal
profit of at least NT$800,000, the FTC said.</P>
      <P>Rice wine is an important ingredient in preparing Chinese food,
and is an important ingredient in "ma yu" chicken, a stew used to
nourish women back to health after childbirth.</P>

TWO POLICE OFFICERS TAKEN HOSTAGE BY MAINLAND DETAINEES RELEASED</P>
      <P>Taipei, June 16 (CNA) Two police officers held hostage by illegal
mainland immigrants at an Ilan detention center for 20 hours were
released unharmed early Wednesday evening.</P>
      <P>After their release the two officers appeared at a press
conference shortly after 6:00 p.m. at the Chinglu detention center,
where 383 illegal mainland immigrants are being held pending
repatriation.</P>
      <P>In answering questions from the press, the officers avoided using
the word of hostage, rather they said they were prevented from
leaving the cell after entering to evaluate an detainee complaining
of illness Tuesday night.</P>
      <P>They said they were not ill-treated and their lives were never in
danger during the 20-hour standoff.</P>
      <P>The detainees rioted Tuesday night after three died and nine more
fell ill from an unknown disease. Most of the detainees are anxious
to return home before the Dragon Boat Festival on Friday.</P>
      <P>They demanded earlier repatriation and staged a hunger strike.</P>
      <P>Two representatives of the detainees appeared at Wednesday's
press conference. They claimed mainland immigrants coming to Taiwan
to seek better lives have never disrupted social order and should not
be treated as criminals.</P>
      <P>The detainees agreed to release the two hostages after Shi
Hwei-yow, secretary general of the Straits Exchange Foundation,
promised during face-to-face negotiations to contact Beijing's
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits within a
month for their earliest repatriation.</P>
      <P>Shi also promised at the press conference not to punish those
responsible for the riot, to provide the detainees with longer periods
of outdoor exercise and to help the families of the three deceased
immigrants to come to Taiwan to collect their bodies.</P>
      <P>According to government's statistics, since Taiwan first opened a
detention center for illegal mainland immigrants in 1987, more than
37,000 mainland citizens have been held.</P>
      <P>Although Beijing has promised to process Taiwan inquiries about
the immigrants' identities within 20 days, on average a detainee
stays in the center for 169 days at a cost of NT$17,000 (US$523).
Since 1987 Taiwan taxpayers have spent a total of NT$700 million
(21.67 million) on detaining illegal mainland immigrants.</P>
      <P>About 36,000 detainees have already been deported with
approximately 1,000 more waiting repatriation in three different
detention centers.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AUSTRALIA'S COMMODITY EXPORTS SEEN AS FALLING DUE TO CURRENCY RISE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,   June  16  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia's commodity exports are
expected to drop by over 6 percent in two years as a result of
falling mineral prices, lower sales of farm products and, above all,
the appreciation of the local dollar, according to the Australian
Bureau of Agriculture and Resource Economics (ABARE).</P>
      <P>ABARE estimates the total value of commodity exports at A$63.1
billion (US$42.1 billion) in 1998-99, a fall of A$3.9 billion (US$2.6
billion) from 1997-98.</P>
      <P>ABARE in a report said lower coal and iron-ore prices will more
than offset higher commodity volumes. Higher gold prices will fail to
boost the total value of exports of the precious metal, with
significant falls in volume predicted.</P>
      <P>The outlook for farm exports is mixed, but a stronger Australian
dollar against the US currency will wipe out some of the gains from
higher prices in the farm sector. The Australian dollar has increased
from 56 US cents in August 1998 to 66 US cents now.</P>
      <P>ABARE said the long-term outlook is more optimistic, however,
with a commodity price recovery forecast alongside stronger world
economic growth in 2000.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Visiting Hungarian Vice Economics Minister
Gabor Gulacsi on Wednesday called on Taiwan to expand its investment
in Hungary amid the increasing amount of two-way trade between the
two countries.</P>
      <P>Gulacsi made the call while presiding over the opening ceremony
for "Hungary Day" at the on-going Eurogate '99 trade fair in Taipei.
Over 30 Hungarian businesses are attending the fair, displaying
products which strongly feature national and cultural
characteristics.</P>
      <P>In his address, Gulacsi described Taiwan as Hungary's major trade
partner in Asia, noting that Taiwan-Hungary trade has grown by 20
percent annually over the last three decades. Most of this trade has
been in high-tech and telecommunication products, he said.</P>
      <P>Gulacsi said that Hungary is expected to join the European Union
by 2002, and that continuing economic reforms are helping his country
in the promotion of stable political and economic development. These
factors will be of benefit to Taiwan if it keeps investing in
Hungary, he pointed out.</P>
      <P>At present, there are 24 Taiwan companies with investments in the
eastern European country, three of which are involved in
computer-related business, while the rest are mostly traders in goods
such as household electric appliances, sports equipment, shoes,
garments, furniture, and bicycles.</P>
      <P>Eurogate '99 has attracted businesses from Hungary, the Czech
Republic, Poland, and Lithuania, all of whom are hoping to gain a
toehold in the Taiwan market and to lure Taiwan investment to their
countries.</P>

      <P>In response to the Kaohsiung City
Government's issuance of its lottery on Tuesday the Ministry of
Finance announced on Wednesday that it will consult with the Bank of
Taiwan about the possibility of launching a national charity lottery
sometime before the end of the year.</P>
      <P>One day after the revised charity lottery statute passed through
the Legislative Yuan, Minister of Finance Paul Chiu told a press
conference that a resolution by the Finance Committee at the
Legislative Yuan demanded his ministry launch the lottery by the end
of this year.</P>
      <P>Government rules require any acquirement contracts with a value
more than a certain level be put to public bid, thus taking more
time to implement. The Finance Committee gave Chiu's ministry six
months to make the necessary arrangements.</P>
      <P>The MOF will consult the Bank of Taiwan which is to be charged
with issuing the lottery tickets in an attempt to speed up the
lottery's inauguration, said Chiu.</P>
      <P>Half of the profits from the lottery will go to charity or causes
that benefit the public, the other half will fund the proposed
national pension. Government bodies are still discussing the
specifics of the pension plan.</P>
      <P>The lottery statute was added by legislators over the MOF's
opposition a clause aimed to bring into Taiwan "internationally
approved sport gambling", such as car racing and horse racing. Chiu
spoke out against the clause by saying the Executive Yuan has firmly
asserted its opposition to any form of gambling and that his ministry
will not permit the activity.</P>
      <P>Chiu remarks about advancing the inauguration of the central
government's lottery came one day after the Kaohsiung City Government
issued its own lottery on Tuesday in defiance of the MOF's
prohibition.</P>
      <P>Insisting that the issuance of lottery is the exclusive authority
of the central government, the MOF has threatened a heavy fine on the
Kaohsiung City Government.</P>

    <DATELINE>Manila  June  16  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Expressing concern over the latest naval
clash in The Korean Peninsula, Philippine President Joseph Ejercito
Estrada on Wednesday urged South and North Korea to continue
exercising maximum restraint to defuse tension in the area.
 The President said the clash, which came only a few days following his
successful state visit to South Korea, should not be allowed to escalate to
ensure peace and stability in East and Southeast Asia.
 "I'm calling on both sides to continue exercising maximum restraint to
allow the situation in the peninsula to normalize," Presidential Spokesman
Jerry Barican quoted President Estrada as saying.
 The statement was issued following reports that the South and North
Korean navies traded fire Tuesday in their first clash in the Yellow
Sea since the Korean War erupted in 1950.</P>
      <P>Barican said the Philippine government is urging both sides to
proceed with their high-level talks scheduled next Monday in Beijing,
even as he noted that the 'unfortunate incident should not affect Kim
Dae-Jung's efforts to improve economic and diplomatic contacts with
the North.
 He added that the Philippines is concerned about the situation in the
Korean Peninsula not only because of Manila's diplomatic ties with Seoul,
but also because of the presence of some 15,000 Filipinos in South Korea.

    <TEXT>
      <P>Three groups of American aviation experts
will arrive in Taipei in the next few days to help investigate three
crashes involving F-16 fighters that Taiwan purchased from the United
States (US), the ROC Air Force headquarters said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>One group of experts will exclusively take part in the probe
into the cause of the latest mishap -- a F-16 single-seater that
disappeared off the coast of Taitung in eastern Taiwan during a
routine training mission on June 1.</P>
      <P>A second team will try to help retrieve the wreckage of the
fighter that is believed to have crashed into the sea.</P>
      <P>The last group will try to determine whether there are any common
factors in the three crashes.</P>
      <P>A F-16 with its crew of two disappeared in the vicinity of the
offshore island of Penghu in March of last year. That mishap was
followed in late January this year by another F-16 two-seater
crashing into a mountainous area near Taitung, claiming the lives of
its two pilots.</P>
      <P>As part of efforts to modernize its air force, Taiwan has ordered
150 F-16 MLU (mid-life-upgraded) fighters from the US. Delivery
of the fighters has yet to be completed.</P>
      <P>The crashes have forced the Air Force to slow the commissioning
of its F-16 jet fighter wings and prolong F-16 pilot training in
order to enhance their capability to operate the highly advanced
warplanes.</P>
      <P>In order to increase the flight safety of the US-made fighters,
the Air Force recently sent a group of officials to Singapore in an
effort to understand how the Singapore Air Force operates its F-16
fleet, a ranking Air Force official said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan lent a helping hand when Singapore established its air
force after the city state's independence in 1965. The Singapore Air
Force has established a five-year no-accident record for its F-16
fighters, the official said.</P>

      <P>When the commencement kicks off on next Thursday morning,
Principal Lai will first use a raft to paddle out to an area of the
sea not far from the school. He will dive some 6 meters to the
ceremonial spot to give the graduates their laminated graduation
certificates.</P>
      <P>The graduates will first dive into the sea and swim to an abalone
shelve on the ocean's bottom. Each student will take a baby abalone
up to a boat waiting on the surface to pay homage to village's
tradition. The students will then dive back into the ocean and swim
to where Principal Lai is waiting with his/her diploma. Baby abalone
is a prime ocean crop of the Homei area.</P>
      <P>Huang, the head of the local PTA, said if the diving commencement
proves successful, the school may continue using different activities
to replace the traditional commencement ceremony, including a
rock-climbing commencement exercise. The school faces a beautiful
portion of the Pacific Ocean while to its left is a giant cliff.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EMERGENCY FMD CONTROL CENTER SET UP IN TAINAN COUNTY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Tainan,  southern  Taiwan,  June  17  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An emergency control
center for foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) was set up Thursday by the
Animal Disease Control Department under the Tainan County Government
as county officials scrambled to prevent a possible FMD from
spreading to the entire cattle population of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The move came after eight head of cattle on two Tainan County
ranches tested positive for FMD Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The discovery came a week after 100 head of cattle on the
offshore front-line island of Kinmen were slaughtered due to FMD
infection. No cases of FMD have been reported among Taiwan's cattle
population since 1929.</P>
      <P>The Animal Disease Control Department of the Tainan County
Government on Wednesday issued an order banning the sell and
transport of livestock off the two Tainan ranches where the eight
FMD-positive head of cattle were discovered.</P>
      <P>Samples of the suspected FMD virus were sent to an animal
quarantine center in Tanshui, Taipei County, for examination, with
those results not expected until Saturday.</P>
      <P>Department officials said, prior to Saturday all livestock from
the two Tainan ranches are barred from being transported off the
ranches. The two ranches' personnel and workers have also been
temporarily ordered not to travel.</P>
      <P>If the Tainan cattle are confirmed to be infected with the FMD
virus, Department officials said all cattle raised on the two ranches
will be slaughtered to prevent further spread of the disease.</P>
      <P>Tainan County is the largest cattle-raising region of Taiwan,
with the cattle population totaling 28,000, about one-fifth of the
total cattle on Taiwan.</P>
      <P>FMD is an acute, contagious disease that can be spread via air.
It infects mainly cloven-hoofed livestock and wild animals. Its
mortality rate is 5 percent among mature livestock and up to 50
percent among young animals.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MORE US CONGRESSMEN APPLAUD ROC AID TO KOSOVO</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  June 16 (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Another two members of the US Congress
have commended Taiwan for the generous US$300 million humanitarian
aid package to the Kosovo refugees.</P>
      <P>Rep. Albert Russell Wynn (D-MD) said Tuesday on the House floor
that "President Lee Teng-hui's considerate offer is representative of
Taiwan's commitment to protecting and promoting human rights and
fulfilling its responsibilities as a member of the international
community."</P>
      <P>"The Republic of China on Taiwan is faced with Chinese Communist
aggression on a daily basis and experiences first hand the threat of
aggression. Through their aid contribution to the Kosovo refugees,
the Republic of China on Taiwan serves as an example to the
international community that with generosity and kindness toward
their fellow human beings, peace can be achieved worldwide," noted
the Maryland Democrat.</P>
      <P>Rep. Wynn added that the aid package certainly comes at an
opportune time. As the Serb troops begin their pullout, many stranded
refugees in the Kosovo mountains are in dire need of food, clothing
and shelter. This assistance will contribute directly to their needs
and will be critical in the uphill battle of rebuilding their homes.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) also spoke in the
Senate Tuesday in recognition of the important contribution Taiwan
has made to the international effort to provide humanitarian
assistance to the refugees of Kosovo.</P>
      <P>The senator said the rebuilding and recovery efforts that are
now beginning in Kosovo will take many years and many resources, and
Taiwan has contributed significant financial and technical resources
to this effort.</P>
      <P>However, the South Dakota Democrat stressed, "more importantly,
Taiwan's generous actions should give comfort to the people of Kosovo
that the world's leaders will help them through this difficult time."</P>
      <P>Last week eight members of the US Congress applauded Taiwan for
offering generous humanitarian aid to the Kosovo refugees.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MINISTER EXPOUNDS ROC'S FOREIGN AID POLICY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 17 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ROC government will appropriate US$100
million annually over the next three fiscal years for carrying out
an aid program for Kosovars, Foreign Minister Jason Hu said on
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Hu made the statement at a meeting of the Legislative Yuan's
Foreign and Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee.</P>
      <P>Hu told lawmakers that the annual expenditure for the US$300
million aid package for Kosovars will account for a mere 0.22 percent
of the government's total budget for fiscal 2000, which will start
on July 1, 1999.</P>
      <P>"This means that only NT$0.22 out of every NT$100 spent by
the government during the year will be used for the Kosovo aid
package," Hu explained, adding that as enforcement of the program may
last more than three years, its ratio to the government's annual
budget may be even lower.</P>
      <P>Hu said the government does not face any pressure to donate a
specified amount of money in a specified period of time for Kosovar
reconstruction.</P>
      <P>"We'll conduct regular evaluation of progress, effectiveness as
well as domestic and overseas reactions while carrying out the aid
program," Hu noted, adding that the program is not expected to
affect implementation of major domestic development projects nor to
require the infusion of the government's second reserve fund.</P>
      <P>The minister pointed out that President Lee Teng-hui's
announcement on June 7 of the generous aid program for Kosovars has
attracted much attention and inspire fervent discussion in the
international community.</P>
      <P>"Our offer to provide short-term accommodation for some Kosovar
refugees in Taiwan for job training in order to better equip them
for the restoration of their homeland upon their return has
especially drawn interest in the world society," Hu said.</P>
      <P>He further revealed that a foreign political heavyweight has
expressed keen interest in the job training program and plans to
travel to Taiwan to see for himself the implementation of the
program when it gets started.</P>
      <P>As some lawmakers doubted the government's wisdom in making such
a huge aid offer, Hu distributed position papers to legislators
present at the meeting, explaining major considerations in drafting
the program.</P>
      <P>Quoting an estimate by major international relief organizations,
reconstruction of the war-torn Yugoslav province of Kosovo requires
at least US$30 billion. "Our committed aid only accounts for 1
percent of the needed fund."</P>
      <P>Hu went on to say that Taiwan's aid package must be comparable to
international mainstream relief programs if it wants to produce
desired results. "We should coordinate with advanced Western
countries or major international relief organizations in assisting
Kosovar refugees."</P>
      <P>The minister also explained the government's foreign aid policy,
stressing that the government has consistently given top priority to
assisting countries with which the Republic of China maintains formal
diplomatic relations.</P>
      <P>"Other principles in formulating foreign aid programs include
humanitarianism, economic development, popular participation,
expansion of domestic demand, balanced use of bilateral and
multilateral relief channels," Hu said.</P>
      <P>The ROC has formed the International Cooperation and Development
Fund to take charge of foreign aid work, Hu said, adding that the
government will follow the examples of some advanced countries by
enacting a foreign aid bill to institutionalize such work.</P>
      <P>Major advanced countries usually set aside budgets for foreign
aid. The Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development (OECD) stipulates that the annual budget for foreign aid
offered by its major members should reach an average of 0.39
percent of their annual gross national product (GNP).</P>
      <P>In fiscal 1997, Taiwan offered NT$6.5 billion (US$200 million)
in foreign aid, accounting for 0.07 percent of its GNP. "The ratio
still falls below the OECD standard and the 0.7 percent level
required by the United Nations," Hu said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GOVERNMENT TO REMOVE IMPORT TARIFFS ON GOODS TO OFFSHORE ISLANDS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  17  (CNA)
(By Amanda Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>In a bid to boost the development of
Taiwan's offshore islands, the executive and legislative sectors have
basically agreed to remove tariffs from selected imports, said
Kuomintang legislative caucus Secretary-General Lee Hsien-jung on
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Lee said the decision supersedes earlier moves to exempt offshore
island residents from personal income, business income and business
taxes. The Ministry of Finance (MOF) deemed the proposed exemptions
unfair, he said.</P>
      <P>Lee made the remarks after he exchanged views with Premier
Vincent Siew and officials from the MOF during the regular weekly
meeting of the KMT's Central Standing Committee.</P>
      <P>As for the establishment of resort casinos on the Penghu Islands,
an idea openly advocated by some legislators, the executive and
legislative sectors have rejected the proposal, Lee noted.</P>
      <P>The MOF said earlier plans to exempt offshore island residents
from business and personal taxes would have made a significant dent
in government revenue. Business income tax exemptions alone would
have resulted in tax revenue losses of up to NT$45 million.</P>
      <P>Moreover, it is likely Taiwan companies would have tried to
register their companies on offshore islands to avoid having to pay
business taxes. This is another reason the MOF is against the
measure.</P>
      <P>The executive sector has been looking at ways to promote the
development of Taiwan's offshore islands, and the preferential tax
scheme and resort casino proposals were two ideas under
consideration.</P>
      <P>In light of the MOF's opposition to the preferential tax scheme,
however, the Executive Yuan withdrew its support for the proposal and
instead opted for the less sweeping option of removing import
tariffs.</P>
      <P>Some KMT legislators said they hope the government will come up
with measures that will make the offshore islands completely tax
free.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING URGED TO SET UP A SHELTER FOR REPATRIATED MAINLAND STOWAWAYS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  17 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China should set up a shelter in
the coastal city of Xiamen for illegal immigrants repatriated to the
mainland, an official of the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC) said on Thursday.</P>
      <P>MAC Spokesman Sheu Ke-sheng made the remarks after the release
Wednesday evening of two police officials who had been taken hostage
by illegal mainland immigrants at a detention center in Ilan county.
The officers were released after a 20-hour standoff.</P>
      <P>Sheu said in a press conference that although Taiwan treats
illegal mainland Chinese in its three detention centers well --
caring for them and satisfying their humanitarian needs -- their
emotional well-being can be affected by extended stays at the
centers.</P>
      <P>Sheu said that if the two sides of the Taiwan Strait could set up
a mainland center for repatriated illegal immigrants, it would result
in improved emotional health among the detainees, and many problems
could be avoided.</P>
      <P>The suggestion to establish such a center was first broached by
Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) Secretary-General Shi Hwei-yow, who
said that after Taiwan repatriates illegal immigrants to the
mainland, they could be sent to the proposed center. While there,
their identities would be established by mainland authorities, and
they could then be returned to where they came from.</P>
      <P>Shi noted that when Jan Jyh-horng, SEF's deputy
secretary-general, visits the mainland later this month to discuss
matters concerning a visit later this year by Wang Daohan, mainland
China's top negotiator with Taiwan, he will suggest that the mainland
set up such a center.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the standoff between detainees at the Ilan detention
and police was the focus of discussion in the legislature when
legislators asked Interior Minister Huang Chu-wen about ways of
preventing similar incidents in the future.</P>
      <P>Huang said the incident took place mainly because the mainland
has been dragging its feet in picking up illegal immigrants. Another
factor is the approach of the traditional Chinese Dragon Boat
Festival, which often causes detainees to think of going home and
being reunited with their families.</P>
      <P>Huang said that Taiwan has always treated the mainland stowaways
humanely and that the incident in Ilan was the result of the
detainees' long stay at the center and of a recent outbreak of a
disease which was probably caused by lack of vitamin B1. The disease
has killed three people and resulted in nine others being
hospitalized. All the victims of the disease have complained of
weakness in their lower limbs.</P>
      <P>Legislator Cheng Chao-ming said that the government has spent a
lot of money to take care of the illegal immigrants. If the mainland
will not pick them up, he suggested that Taiwan notify the mainland
that the illegal immigrants will be sent to uninhabited islands, such
as the Pratas island group.</P>
      <P>Legislator Huang Yi-chiao suggested that the government take the
initiative, saying that if the mainland uses a lack of funds as an
excuse, the government could pay for immigrants' repatriation first
and later seek reimbursement from the mainland.</P>
      <P>According to government statistics, since Taiwan first opened a
detention center for illegal mainland immigrants in 1987, more than
37,000 mainland Chinese citizens have been held in Taiwan's centers.</P>
      <P>Although Beijing has promised to process Taiwan inquiries about
the immigrants' identities within 20 days, a detainee stays at the
center for an average of 169 days, and at a cost of NT$17,000
(US$523). Since 1987 Taiwan taxpayers have spent a total of NT$700
million (US$21.67 million) on detained illegal mainland immigrants.</P>
      <P>About 36,000 detainees have already been deported, and
approximately 1,000 more are awaiting repatriation in Taiwan's
three detention centers.</P>

October, and prior to that, the Liberian president will visit New
York to take part in the United Nations' annual general meeting.
During the meeting, Taylor will try to rally support for the Republic
of China's entry into the United Nations and UN-affiliated
organizations, Captan added.</P>
      <P>A congenial Lee said to Captan that he and his Liberian delegates
are welcomed to join people around Taiwan in observing the Dragon
Boat Festival, one of the most colorful national holidays of the
Republic of China. To celebrate the holiday, which falls this year on
June 18, people will hold dragon boat races, eat rice dumplings, or
tsungtse, and compose poems.</P>
      <P>Captan and an official delegation from Liberia, including
Planning and Economics Minister John McClain and Finance Minister
John Bestman Sr., have been in Taipei since Monday to attend the
second meeting of the Republic of China-Liberian Mixed Commission,
which opened Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Captan and his ROC counterpart, Jason Hu, jointly signed the
minutes of the meeting and an investment guarantee agreement Thursday
at the close of the three-day meeting.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, the ROC agreed to provide two electrical
generators to replace facilities in the country's capital, Monrovia,
that were damaged during Liberia's civil wars.</P>
      <P>Taiwan also decided to extend aid for the second phase of the
reconstruction of Liberia's international airport. Taiwan contributed
to the first phase of the reconstruction project, which was completed
in May this year.</P>
      <P>Other aid that Taiwan has committed to Liberia included seaport
facilities, medical equipment, agricultural machinery and fertilizer.</P>
      <P>The ROC and Liberia decided to hold the annual mixed commission
meeting alternately in Monrovia and Taipei when Taylor visited Taipei
in November 1997. The first meeting was held in Monrovia in April
last year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>HONG KONG IS OF NO HINDRANCE TO TAIWAN'S ACCESSION TO WTO: BOFT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  17  (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Hong Kong has promised not to impede the
Working Group of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in accepting
Taiwan's entrance working report, the Board of Foreign Trade (BOFT)
under the Ministry of Economic Affairs said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Canada has also agreed to sign a bilateral agreement with Taiwan
by the end of June, a BOFT official indicated. Taiwan is scheduled to
hold another Working Group meeting at the end of July to finish
Taiwan's entrance working report, the official added.</P>
      <P>To date, Taiwan has completed bilateral agreements with 24 of the
26 WTO contracting parties that have requested talks with Taiwan on
tariff concessions and market-opening measures. Only Canada and Hong
Kong have yet to sign accords.</P>
      <P>Wei Ko-ming, deputy director-general of the BOFT, noted that
Taiwan planned to hold its 11th WTO entrance working meeting at the
end of July. Given that the WTO Working Group is to accept Taiwan's
entrance working report on that occasion, Taiwan will "technically"
complete all the bilateral and multilateral consulting work
concerning its bid for membership in the world trade regulatory body,
Wei remarked.</P>
      <P>The final touch in regard to Taiwan's entry will be left to the
approval of the WTO's General Board of Directors, Wei added.</P>
      <P>A BOFT-sponsored seminar on the impact of Taiwan's WTO membership
on its domestic industries was held in Taipei on Thursday. Wei made
his remarks during the gathering.</P>
      <P>This year is crucial to Taiwan in its bid for WTO accession, said
the ranking BOFT official.</P>
      <P>Since a bilateral accord was signed between Taiwan and South
Africa in 1995, Taiwan has completed bilateral agreements with the
Czech Republic, Slovakia, Turkey, El Salvador, Colombia, Uruguay,
Chile, South Korea, Australia, Iceland, Norway, Japan, Malaysia, the
Philippines, New Zealand, Singapore, the United States, Switzerland,
Mexico, Hungary, Argentina, the European Union and Thailand.</P>
      <P>In light of the fact that Taiwan has held a total of 10 WTO
entrance Working Group meetings, the examination of its entrance
working reports is largely finished, Wei stressed.</P>

financial issues, and plastics and chemical stocks posted gains on
the day, rising 4.2 percent, 3.2 percent and 1 percent, respectively.</P>

    <DATELINE>Tokyo,  June  17  (CNA)
(By K.M. Huang and Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The presidential candidate of Taiwan's
largest opposition party said that if he is elected president, he
will conduct across-the-board dialogues, including political
dialogues, with mainland authorities.</P>
      <P>Chen Shui-bian of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), made
the remark while being interviewed by a major Japanese daily in
Taipei Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Chen said in the interview, printed in The Yomiuri Shimbun, that
although President Lee Teng-hui has established the framework for
democracy in Taiwan, a true democracy has yet to be realized.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that there are three main problems in Taiwan, namely
social order, economic injustice and a political system that is
influenced by money and criminal elements. He said the ruling
Kuomintang cannot solve the problem and that the next stage in
Taiwan's democratic reform must be conducted by the DPP.</P>
      <P>As for cross-strait relations, Chen said that if the nation
follows the course set by President Lee, then no headway will be made
in regard to cross-strait ties, especially since the KMT has been
dodging political dialogues with the mainland.</P>
      <P>Chen predicted that Taiwan will develop a special relationship
with the mainland, and that the relationship will include much room
for discussion.</P>
      <P>As to the mainland's strong opposition to Taiwan independence, a
defining belief of the DPP, Chen said that his goal of establishing a
Taiwan Republic has not changed, but he stressed that the fate of
Taiwan will be decided by the Taiwan people. He said he would respect
the fact that most Taiwan people want the status quo maintained,
adding that he would face the issue in a pragmatic manner.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DOH TO SET UP DIOXIN-TESTING LAB</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  17  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Department of Health
(DOH) will set up a special laboratory to monitor the dioxin content
in various foodstuffs sold in the Taiwan market, a senior official
said on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Chen Shu-kong, director of the DOH's Bureau of Food Sanitation,
said the DOH finds an urgent need to set up such a laboratory after
the recent discovery of dioxin contamination among livestock and
dairy products in Belgium.</P>
      <P>Chen conceded that the DOH has not yet worked out any reference
figures for determining whether a foodstuff has been contaminated by
dioxin, a known carcinogen.</P>
      <P>Noting that dioxin is fat-soluble, Chen said dioxin, like
radioactivity, exists in the natural environment. US food sanitation
authorities stipulate that the average dioxin content in all kinds of
foodstuffs should not exceed 59.42 pg (pico grams). One pg equals one
ppt (part per trillion).</P>
      <P>Chen said the 15-member European Union has not set any standards
for dioxin content in general foodstuffs. Nevertheless, the World
Health Organization (WHO) suggests that per capita daily intake of
dioxin should not exceed 4 pg for each kilogram of body weight.</P>
      <P>For local people, the DOH has suggested that the maximum daily
dioxin intake be set at 118.84 pg, double the US level but only about
half the WHO standard.</P>
      <P>Based on all these standards, Chen said the recent dioxin
contamination in Belgium cannot be considered extremely detrimental.</P>
      <P>Chen said the DOH has started preparations for setting up a
dioxin laboratory, adding that a German dioxin examination expert is
scheduled to arrive in Taiwan next week to providing counseling
services and technological advice.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Bureau of Commodity Inspection and Quarantine
(BCIQ) unveiled the results of an examination of dioxin content in
four batches of Friesland-brand yogurt on Thursday.</P>
      <P>BCIQ Director-General Chen Tso-chen said the dioxin content in
Friesland's original, low-fat, strawberry and composite fruit yogurt
is only 0.1 ppt.</P>
      <P>"The figure is far lower than America's 1 ppt, France's 4 ppt,
the Netherlands' 6 ppt and Germany's 5 ppt," Chen said, adding that
local consumers can safely continue consuming this brand of yogurt.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN URGES BEIJING TO RESUME TALKS ON PRACTICAL ISSUES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 17 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) on
Thursday urged Beijing to resume talks with Taipei about issues
concerning the rights and interests of the peoples on the two sides
of the Taiwan Strait, including the repatriation of stowaways and
hijackers.</P>
      <P>MAC spokesman Sheu Ke-sheng said that recent rioting by mainland
Chinese inmates at an Ilan detention center for illegal immigrants
resulted from Beijing's reluctance to take back the immigrants.</P>
      <P>Most of the mainland immigrants at the center have been there a
long time, Sheu said, noting that inmates often become homesick
during their stay there.</P>
      <P>There are now more than 1,000 mainland illegal immigrants at
Taiwan's three detention centers awaiting repatriation.</P>
      <P>Although Red Cross societies in Taiwan and mainland China signed
in 1991 the "Kinmen Agreement," which obligates the mainland to take
back illegal mainland immigrants within 20 days of their capture,
Beijing has never respected the agreement. Last year, it took back
only four groups of detained stowaways, totaling about 400 people,
according to the MAC.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has seized annually an average of 5,000 illegal mainland
Chinese immigrants over the past 10 years, and detainees stay in
Taiwan an average of 130 days before being taken back by mainland
authorities, the MAC said.</P>
      <P>Because of Beijing's reluctance, some mainland detainees wait
years to return home.</P>
      <P>Asked about reports that mainland detainees were forced to live
in overcrowded cells and treated badly, Sheu said Taiwan has done its
best to take care of the detainees. For instance, the centers allow
detainees to make free long-distance telephone calls to their
families during major Chinese holidays, such as the Lunar New Year,
the Dragon Boat Festival and the Mid-Autumn Festival.</P>
      <P>For every 169 days that a detainee stays at a Taiwan detention
center, the government pays some NT$17,000 (US$523) in food, clothing
and housing costs. Since 1987 Taiwan taxpayers have spent a total of
NT$700 million (US$21.67 million) on housing illegal mainland
immigrants, according to official statistics.</P>
      <P>The detention of illegal immigrants has become a heavy financial
burden to Taiwan, MAC Chairman Su Chi said Wednesday in a briefing to
the Legislative Yuan. He condemned the mainland's deliberate
procrastination in taking back the illegal immigrants, saying that
"the mainland authorities do not care about their own people at all."</P>
      <P>The mainland side makes the problem, but leaves the cleanup to
Taiwan, Su said, noting that in the current situation, Taiwan can do
nothing but urge the mainland to respect the Kinmen Agreement and
call for the resumption of cross-strait talks aimed at resolving
problems like the repatriation of illegal immigrants.</P>
      <P>The cross-strait dialogues were unilaterally suspended by Beijing
to protest President Lee Teng-hui's American visit in June 1995. The
move also cut off efforts to resolve problems directly affecting
people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,   June   17  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan should allow direct trade,
transportation and postal services with mainland China on a mutual
beneficial and reciprocal basis, an opposition Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) stalwart said on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Chen Shui-bian, former Taipei mayor and the DPP's presidential
candidate for the next presidential race slated for March 2000, said
that in the current international circumstances, Taiwan and mainland
China should normalize the so-called "three direct links" to benefit
both sides.</P>
      <P>Trade relations between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait should
not be bound by the "no haste, be patient" investment policy
advocated by President Lee Teng-hui and the broadly defined "go west"
idea espoused by others, Chen said in a speech on cross-strait ties
delivered at a seminar with small business leaders from central
Taichung County.</P>
      <P>In view of the prospective membership of the World Trade
Organization for both Taiwan and mainland China by the end of this
year, Chen pointed out that the two sides will have to face the three
links issue sooner or later.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, the DPP presidential contender said that
the two sides could first consider setting up sea cargo traffic and
later expand into passenger flight services.</P>
      <P>Turning to direct cross-strait trade, he proposed that the
government set a ceiling from 20 percent to 50 percent for mainland
Chinese capital entering Taiwan -- the same ceiling currently imposed
on capital inflow from other foreign countries around the world.</P>

    <HEADLINE>10 PERCENT OF COEDS HAVE BEEN SEXUALLY HARASSED: POLL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 17 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>About 10 percent of the female students at
nine local universities have been sexually harassed on campus,
according to the results of a survey released on Thursday.</P>
      <P>The survey of 482 coeds at the nine northern Taiwan universities
found that 49 of the respondents said they have sustained sexual
harassment on campus.</P>
      <P>Among them, only 12, or about 25 percent, had filed complaints
with school authorities, and 10 of those said they were dissatisfied
with their schools' passivity or lax attitude in handling their
cases.</P>
      <P>The harassment came from classmates, teachers or unidentified
persons from outside the campus, according to the survey, jointly
conducted by the Awakening Foundation and the National Coeds Action
Alliance.</P>
      <P>The survey results show that 24 of the victims, or 51.1 percent,
were harassed by their classmates; 10, or 21 percent, were harassed
by teachers; and 13, or 27.7 percent, were harassed by outsiders.</P>
      <P>The two women's rights promotion organizations said the survey
results show that local university authorities do not handle campus
sexual harassment cases in a positive manner.</P>
      <P>"We hope the survey will help push local universities and the
Ministry of Education to pay due attention to the issue," said a
spokeswoman for the Awakening Foundation.</P>
      <P>According to the survey, two of the schools studied -- Chang Gung
University and National Chungshing University (Taipei campus) -- have
not set up any special units to handle sexual harassment complaints.</P>
      <P>Although National Taiwan Normal University (NTNU) has set up a
special task force to handle such complaints, it has never unveiled a
set of clear, definitive procedures for handling this type of case.</P>
      <P>The Awakening Foundation said suspicious sexual harassment
incidents were first reported at the NTNU five years ago. "It's
unthinkable that the school has so far not laid out clear procedures
for handling such cases," said the spokeswoman.</P>
      <P>Even more ironic is that eight of the schools studied have never
formally handled any sexual harassment cases.</P>
      <P>The poll results also show that 81.1 percent of the respondents
are not even aware that their schools have special agencies to handle
sexual harassment complaints.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 82.3 percent said that even if they had been sexually
harassed, they would not file complaints with school administrative
authorities, while 57.4 percent said they might seek the assistance
of their classmates.</P>
      <P>However, 68.4 percent said that if their schools have formal
counseling offices to handle sexual harassment or gender equality
issues, they would contact those offices for advice or assistance.</P>
      <P>The six other schools studied were National Taiwan University,
Soochow University, National Chengchi University, Fu Jen Catholic
University, National Chung Cheng University and Tamkang University.</P>

before pursuing development.</P>
      <P>The vice president met with local military and government
leaders, as well as elected representatives and chiefs of various

      <P>Lien said that Kinmen has played an important role over the last

      <P>He also noted that the central government appropriated NT$5.1
billion to finance five development projects in Kinmen when he was

      <P>Following President Lee's visit to Kinmen last January, he added,
the government has decided to use another NT$19.5 billion for 10

    <TEXT>
      <P>Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) Chairman
Koo Chen-fu on Thursday expressed the hope that a forthcoming visit
by an SEF official to mainland China will also help rekindle regular
cross-Taiwan Strait talks on technical issues.</P>
      <P>The major purpose of SEF Vice Secretary-General Jan Jih-horng's
trip to mainland China is to arrange a visit to Taiwan later this
year by Koo's mainland Chinese counterpart, Wang Daohan of the
Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait
(ARATS).</P>
      <P>However, Koo said bilateral technical talks should be resumed as
soon as possible, because issues such as the repatriation of illegal
mainland Chinese immigrants and fishery disputes are of major concern
to the people on both sides of the strait.</P>
      <P>He illustrated the importance of such talks by noting the recent
incident which occurred in a detention center for illegal mainland
Chinese immigrants in eastern Ilan County, where inmates staged a
protest over poor conditions and long waits for repatriation.</P>
      <P>Two police officers at the detention center were taken hostage on
Wednesday by mainland Chinese detainees, who only released the two
officers on Thursday after Taiwan authorities promised to meet their
demands for speedy repatriation.</P>
      <P>Expressing delight that the incident had been resolved smoothly,
Koo called on mainland Chinese authorities to quickly restart
systematic cross-strait technical issues based on the Kinmen Accord
signed during his first meeting with Wang in Singapore in 1993.</P>
      <P>According to Koo, more than 1,000 illegal mainland Chinese
immigrants, detained at centers in northern Hsinchu, Ilan and the
outlying Matsu Island, are currently awaiting repatriation. Some of
them have being waiting for over six years because of mainland
China's unwillingness to take them back, he added.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and the mainland should be able to make substantive
progress in two-way talks regarding such issues if institutionalized
SEF-ARATS talks can reopen during Jan's visit to mainland China from
June 27-29, Koo claimed.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks during an inspection tour of the Taipei-based
SEF headquarters.</P>
      <P>SEF and ARATS are semi-official organizations representing Taipei
and Beijing, respectively, which were set up to handle bilateral
exchanges in the absence of formal contacts. But regular SEF-ARATS
negotiations were unilaterally suspended by Beijing in 1995 after
President Lee Teng-hui offended Beijing by paying an unofficial visit
to the United States in the summer of that year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US EXPERT CALLS FOR NEW CHINA POLICY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,   June   17  (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The challenge now before US
policymakers is to build a China policy that safeguards American
security and fosters developments within mainland China that allow
freedom, opportunity and civil society to flourish, said an American
expert Thursday.</P>
      <P>Stephen J. Yates, a senior policy analyst in the Asian Studies
Center at Washington-based Heritage Foundation, wrote in an analysis
that the Cox report demonstrates the strategic cost of weak
safeguards on sensitive military technology. "Unrealistic optimism
about establishing a strategic partnership with China seemed to blind
the Clinton administration to the danger posed by relaxed controls on
strategic goods," he added.</P>
      <P>The US Congress must act to protect Americans from the abnormal
trade in US nuclear and missile technologies, but at the same time
promote a vigorous normal trade relationship with the People's
Republic of China to foster continued economic reforms and to empower
the mainland Chinese people to take greater control over their own
lives, noted Yates.</P>
      <P>The policy analyst said that to restore a proper sense
of priority and balance between security and commercial interests in
mainland China, the United States should extend the PRC's normal
trade relations status and conclude the World Trade Organization
agreement with the PRC.</P>
      <P>But Yates stressed that the PRC's missile modernization,
advanced by technology transfers catalogued in the Cox report,
requires that the Clinton administration commit to an earliest
deployment of effective national and theater missile defense systems.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, he continued, the United States should
increase scrutiny of and controls on high-tech exports, because
controls on the export of dual-use technology have been weakened
since the end of the Cold War, but especially during the Clinton
administration.</P>
      <P>The US should restore stiff penalties for firms whose negligence
compromises US security, and work to rebuild a multilateral regime to
coordinate controls on the spread of the most dangerous dual-use
technologies. By calling for the reauthorization of an updated 1979
Export Administration Act, the Senate could ensure that national
security is not compromised in the course of continued normal trade,
said Yates.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Yugoslavian magician
Vukouil Miroslab is so absorbed in his career, he even performed
conjuring tricks at the courthouse prior to marrying to his Taiwan
girlfriend.</P>
      <P>Thursday in a ceremony presided over by a Taichung judge,
Miroslab, better known by his professional pseudonym "Rossy", married
Chen Hsu-wan, whom he met last year at the Woozland recreation park
in Tainan County, southern Taiwan. At the time, Rossy had been
working as a magician at the park for nearly four months.</P>
      <P>The two 35 year olds met when Chen, a former a representative of
a foreign trade company, went with friends to Woozland. She found
herself particularly intrigued by the magic show staged by the
handsome European.</P>
      <P>Chen approached Rossy after his show was over and asked about his
tricks, beginning a friendship that led to an international marriage
a year later.</P>
      <P>After becoming Rossy's girlfriend, Chen quit her trading company
job and began to work as Rossy's assistant. Chen had been fascinated
with magic since she was a little girl.</P>
      <P>Last year, Rossy planned to return home to Belgrade to accept a
magic job with Chen as his assistant. However, they discovered the
difficulty of obtaining a visa into Yugoslavia for a citizen from a
country which doesn't have diplomatic relations with the Balkan
nation.</P>
      <P>Rossy asked for help in getting Chen a visa from the mayor of
Belgrade. The inquiry resulted in another friendship, this time
between the magician, his Taiwan girlfriend and the mayor. Rossy and
Chen arranged for the mayor to visit Taiwan recently and acted as
guides for him.</P>
      <P>The magician was asked by well-wishers during the wedding why he
married Chen. Rossy said "no reason is the best reason," but cited
that Chen's tenderness and thoughtfulness made him feel he wanted
start a family with her.</P>
      <P>Besides, he said, an international marriage allows him a better
opportunity to understand different people and cultures.</P>
      <P>Rossy has a strong political family background. One of his
brother-in-laws is a heavyweight in a Yugoslavian opposition party
who once was defeated in a presidential election. Another
brother-in-law is an incumbent minister in Italy.</P>
      <P>Rossy, a born conjurer, said he began his career in magic at the
age of 12. As a professional magician, he has performed his conjuring
tricks in many countries, including the US gambling mecca Los Vegas.</P>
      <P>Rossy said his greatest wish is for he and his new bride to make
a round-the-world performance tour.</P>

      <P>Australian Foreign Affairs Minister
Alexander Downer said here on Friday that he hopes the two sides of
the Taiwan Strait can reconcile, and the sooner the better.</P>
      <P>Downer, who is on an official visit to Washington, said the
Australians don't particularly enjoy from time to time finding
themselves "squashed like some sort of meat in a Beijing-Taipei
sandwich."</P>
      <P>As far as relationships between mainland China and Taiwan are
concerned, Downer said at a press conference that from the point of
view of Australia, which has a very important political, economic and
strategic relationship with the PRC and important economic links with
Taiwan, "the sooner there is an appropriate degree of reconciliation
between Beijing and Taipei, the better."</P>
      <P>Downer said Australia engages with the PRC on a wide range of
issues, which includes disarmament issues. "I think the PRC knows
only too well what Australia's approach to missile proliferation is.
We obviously want to see restraint exercised throughout the region,"
he said.</P>
      <P>He pointed out, however, that Beijing has not discussed with
Sydney matters related to mainland China's increased missile
deployment in areas close to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Downer met with mainland Chinese Ambassador Hua Junduo soon after
he assumed his foreign minister's post in March 1996 to express
Australia's concern about communist Chinese missile firing and
live-ammunition war games on Taiwan's doorstep.</P>
      <P>In addition, he also expressed welcome at the United States'

      <P>The Japanese version of Republic of
China President Lee Teng-hui's new book "With the Peoples Always in
My Heart" has become a best seller in Japan since it was published
June 3.</P>
      <P>The publisher of Lee's book in Japan, the Peace and Happiness
Through Prosperity (PHP) institute, said in an interview with CNA
that the book has sold over 50,000 copies in a two-week period to
become a best seller among books concerning the economic and
politic fields.</P>
      <P>PHP said that the initial printing of 27,000 sold out while the
50,000 replacement copies sent to bookstores hardly met demand. PHP
said 20,000 additional copies will be printed June 22.</P>
      <P>PHP officials said that in the past, books dealing with politics
and economics were considered best sellers in Japan if they sold
50,000 copies. In recent years, due to a sluggish economy, a book of
any topic was considered a best seller if it sold between 20,000 and
30,000 copies.</P>
      <P>They noted that Lee's books entered the best seller list in just
two weeks, and that sales are increasing daily.</P>
      <P>The 232-page book in Japanese, documents Lee's life and political
philosophy. It sells for 1,600 yen (US$13) a copy.</P>
      <P>PHP is planning to run excerpts of the book in the next issue of
Voice, a political and economic monthly in Japan with a circulation
of 200,000 copies.</P>
      <P>Lee's book consists of eight chapters -- "The journey of my
thought," "My political philosophy," "The power behind Taiwan's
prosperity and peace," "The present expectation of the PRC," "The
present expectation of the US," "the present expectation of Japan,"
and "The contribution that can be made by Taiwan, the US and Japan."</P>
      <P>In the book, Lee said that Tokyo is "excessively humble' toward
Beijing and dares not say words other than "yes" when negotiating
with Beijing.</P>
      <P>Lee advises Japan to "discern the real situation on mainland
China and negotiate with Beijing fearlessly."</P>

    <HEADLINE>US LOWERS PUNITIVE ANTI-DUMPING DUTIES ON TAIWAN DRAM MAKERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  June 18 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The US Department of Commerce (DOC) on
Thursday lowered the average anti-dumping duties on Taiwan's DRAM
makers from 16.65 percent to 16.41 percent.</P>
      <P>The DOC came to the decision after finding obvious administrative
negligence in its previous assessment of the punitive duties on
Taiwan's Vanguard International Semiconductor Corp. (VISC) on May 21.</P>
      <P>The VISC appealed to the DOC on June 1 for a reassessment of the
company's imported prices after the DOC made its preliminary ruling
May 21.</P>
      <P>As a result, VISC's punitive anti-dumping duties were reduced
from 10.36 percent to 9.56 percent while the average weighted duties
for Mosel VItelic Inc., Nan Ya Technology and Etron Technology Inc.
were downward adjusted to 16.41 percent.</P>
      <P>The modification will consequently result in a lower guaranteed
deposit that all Taiwan companies involved have to pay.</P>
      <P>The DOC is scheduled to hold a public hearing on the case July 27
and to reach a final ruling on the dumping duties prior to October
11.</P>
      <P>If the ruling finds dumping did occur, the independent US
International Trade Committee (ITC) will make a final ruling within
45 days on whether the US domestic industry has been harmed by the
imports.</P>
      <P>The US Customs Authority will not issue an anti-dumping order
against Taiwan imports until a final decision is reached by both the
ITC and the DOC on the harm to the US industry.

Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) will uphold the principle of
"Taiwan First" in stepping up contact and dialogue with mainland

Chen Shui-bian said on Friday.</P>
      <P>Former Taipei Mayor Chen made the remark during a visit to

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  18 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The 1999 Taipei International Dragon Boat
Tournament kicked off on Friday on the Keelung River, with 81 teams
from home and abroad participating.</P>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou spoke in both English and Mandarin at
the opening ceremony of the annual tournament, which is part of the
activities to mark the Dragon Boat Festival, one of the most colorful
national holidays in the Chinese calendar.</P>
      <P>On Dragon Boat Festival Day, which falls on June 18 this year,
dragon boat races are held, glutinous rice dumplings, or "tsungtze"
are consumed, and poems are composed to celebrate the event.</P>
      <P>In his speech, Ma said he hoped that friendship will be further
nurtured between the people of Taiwan and their guests from overseas
during the boat races. He also did not forget to promote the city's
commerce by urging the foreign visitors to "do more shopping" during
their stay.</P>
      <P>The Taipei dragon boat race will run for three days until Sunday.
The US men's and women's teams from Los Angeles, which were the title
winners of the 1998 Taipei International Dragon Boat Tournament, are
tipped for first place again this year.</P>
      <P>Two racing teams from mainland China's Guangdong and Fujian
provinces, respectively, met with two rival teams from Taiwan in a
friendly race to kick off the competition, which began on Friday
morning amid slight chaos due to heavy rain.</P>
      <P>Similar dragon boat races were also scheduled Friday in Keelung
City, Taipei County and in Kaohsiung City. Premier Vincent Siew
addressed the opening of the race at Taipei County's Bitan, or Green
Lake, where 50 men's and three women's teams competed for a top prize
of NT$500,000 (US$21,368).</P>
      <P>The Dragon Boat Festival, which is celebrated on the fifth day of
the fifth lunar month, was originally devised to commemorate the
ancient Chinese patriot and poet Chu Yuan (343-290 B.C.).</P>
      <P>Chu Yuan was said to have jumped to his death into the Milo
River, located in mainland China's modern day Hunan Province, to
express his rancor and disappointment with the corrupt imperial
government.</P>
      <P>Admirers of Chu Yuan's integrity, patriotism and literary talent
cast rice dumplings into the river to feed the fish that might
otherwise have dined on Chu Yuan's body. This led to the custom of
eating tsungtze on the day of Chu Yuan's death, a practice observed
by Chinese communities worldwide ever since.</P>
      <P>In addition to boat racing, eating tsungtze and composing poems,
people in Taiwan also hang special herb bouquets on their front doors
to keep evil away from their homes.</P>
      <P>At noon, the main feast of the festival is served, with the
adults drinking Hsiunghuang wine, a wine mixed with a traditional
Chinese medicine which is believed to have the power to kill diseases
and chase away poisonous insects.</P>
      <P>While the adults drink the orange-colored wine, the children play
with eggs, since according to custom, eggs can be stood on end at
noon of the fifth day of the fifth lunar month. True or false? Check
it out for yourself, but you will have to wait until next year.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  18  (CNA)
(By Wendy Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan aborigines' social awareness has
increased, and instead of asking the government to improve their
plight, they now demand simultaneous development with the rest of
society, the Council of Aboriginal Affairs (CAA) chief said on
Friday.</P>
      <P>CAA Chairman Hua Chiah-chih made the remarks in an opening speech
at a three-day international seminar on aboriginal rights, jointly
held by government agencies and National Taiwan University's College
of Law.</P>
      <P>Hua stressed that the government's duties should not be
restricted to merely offering subsidies to aborigines, but should be
expanded to raising aboriginal people's dignity and competitiveness,
in addition to working toward an ideal society where different
cultures respect each other.</P>
      <P>The government's original subsidy policy has hurt the aborigines'
pride, Hua said, and the correct government aboriginal policy should
cover both respect for cultural differences and promotion of
aboriginal development.</P>
      <P>In addition, Hua added, the Republic of China's legal system
should also acknowledge and take into consideration the aborigines'
traditional way of life and cultural standards.</P>
      <P>Hua pointed out that the 1993 International Human Rights
Conference held in Vienna named that year "world aboriginal year,"
and announced to the international community its dedication to ensure
basic human rights and freedom for the world's aboriginal people.</P>
      <P>National consciousness of aboriginal issues and rights have risen
under the joint efforts of the government, the aboriginal elite, and
academia, Hua said, adding that the aborigines' awareness of their
own rights have also awakened.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, Hua pointed out, the government has faced
several bottlenecks in its promotion of aboriginal policies. For
example, he said, when the CAA was drafting an aborigine development
act, it had trouble defining "aboriginal collective intellectual
property rights" and how to protect them.</P>

      <P>A scientist from Taiwan is at the
forefront of moves to find a solution to a drinking water crisis in
Sydney, which is affecting about 4 million people in Australia's
largest city.</P>
      <P>In an interview with the CNA on Friday, James Yu, president of
the Australian Chinese Engineers Association (ACEA), said the crisis,
which derived from contamination by parasites nearly a year ago, "is
far from over."</P>
      <P>However, he said that with the help of other Chinese scientists,
the ACEA has come up with a proposal following research and a series
of discussions over the past few months.</P>
      <P>The report will be made public at a presentation at Sydney
University on July 7 so that Australian experts can scrutinize it and
make some essential modifications, Yu said.</P>
      <P>Last year, an inquiry into the drinking water problem came up
with the suggestion that activated carbon and ozone technology could
be installed to purify the water. But the proposal was dropped
because at A$300 million (US$200 million), the cost was considered
too high.</P>
      <P>Yu's proposed solution, on the other hand, will cost only about
A$57 million.</P>

top negotiator with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Wang, chairman of the Beijing-based Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS), is scheduled to visit Taipei in
October, but his Taiwan counterpart, Straits Exchange Foundation
(SEF) Chairman Koo Chen-fu, said on Thursday that any time from the

the mainland.</P>
      <P>Jan is scheduled to fly to Beijing on June 27 for talks on
several issues which might include the repatriation of mainland
Chinese illegal immigrants. The issue was highlighted following the
outbreak of a mystery disease among some mainland inmates of a Taiwan
illegal immigrant detention center which resulted in panic among the
inmates, prompting them to take two police officers hostage at the
center. The officers were later released unharmed.</P>
      <P>Wang's trip is intended as a reciprocal visit for Koo's Shanghai

issues concerning the rights of people on both sides of the strait.</P>
      <P>Since mainland China cut off its dialogue with the Republic of
China on June 16, 1995, Su said, mainland authorities have refused to
"open the door to negotiation," despite last October's meeting in
Shanghai between Wang and Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) Chairman
Koo Chen-fu.</P>
      <P>In addition, Su said, the mainland has constantly demanded that
the two sides of the strait conduct political negotiations. He urged
mainland China not to continue its search for an "intangible moon,"
but to instead opt for a dialogue on practical issues, such as the
repatriation of mainland hijackers and illegal immigrants.</P>
      <P>Su said SEF Vice Chairman Jan Jyh-horng will leave for Beijing
on June 27 to make preparations for Wang's fall visit to Taiwan.
Taiwan wishes to reach a decision with ARATS on the date of Wang's
visit, in addition to promoting "double-track" talks to settle
cross-strait issues and to secure the signing of agreements, he said.</P>
      <P>Su said he supported a suggestion by SEF officials that a
detention center for illegal mainland immigrants who have come to
Taiwan be established in the mainland's Xiamen.</P>
      <P>He said he could understand the homesickness the illegal
immigrants must feel, adding that if mainland China cannot face this
problem with pragmatism, the problem will not be solved.</P>
      <P>Su also urged mainland China to take back illegal immigrants
within one month. According to statistics, there are currently over
1,000 illegal immigrants awaiting repatriation in Taiwan detention
centers, and some have been waiting for over six years to return
home.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PHILIPPINES MAY PROTEST MALAYSIA'S MOVES ON SPRATLYS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Manila  June  18  (CNA)
(By Timothy Sun)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Philippine government may file a
diplomatic protest with Malaysia if reports that it has occupied two
reefs in the Spratly islands are verified.</P>
      <P>Presidential spokesman Jerry Barican said Friday the Department
of Foreign Affairs (DFA) is waiting for a report from the armed
forces, which has been instructed to look into the alleged Malaysian
occupation.</P>
      <P>Earlier reports said Malaysia has occupied two small shoals in
the Spratlys since two weeks ago.</P>
      <P>DFA Secretary Domingo Siazon confirmed having heard such rumors,
but said the reports must be verified before any action would be
taken.</P>
      <P>"A move similar to the filing of a diplomatic protest by Beijing
would be premature unless Manila verifies the nature of the reported
occupation -- whether this was within the Kalayaan (Freedom) island
group and whether the Malaysian placed markers, built structures or
stationed troops in the reefs," Barican noted.</P>
      <P>The Philippines had filed at least two diplomatic protests with
mainland China for its military buildup in Mischief Reef in the
Spratlys, which is well within the Philippines' 200-mile exclusive
economic zone.</P>
      <P>The Philippines and Malaysia along with mainland China, the
Republic of China, Vietnam and Brunei all claim the Spratlys in part
or in whole.</P>
      <P>Barican said the DFA stressed the need for a code of conduct and
multilateral negotiations among claimant countries in view of the
reported incursion.</P>
      <P>The government is pressing for actions to ease tensions among
claimant countries and to determine how differences may be resolved
peacefully.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING NOT TO DEAL WITH PRO-TAIWAN INDEPENDENCE FORCES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Beijing, June 18 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China will not engage in any type
of dealings with any pro-Taiwan independence political party, a noted
mainland Chinese academic said on Friday.</P>
      <P>Xu Shichuan, director of the Institute of Taiwan under the
Chinese Academy of Social Science, told CNA that Beijing will not
engage in dealings with Taiwan's major opposition Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) until the pro-Taiwan independence party
changes its position in regard to Taiwan's independence.</P>
      <P>Xu, who recently visited Taiwan, said a resolution issued
recently by the DPP made it very clear that the party has not shifted
away from its pro-Taiwan independence viewpoint, although it has made
modifications in its policy.</P>
      <P>Xu's remarks came on the heels of comments by Chen Shui-bian, a
DPP stalwart and the party's candidate in Taiwan's next presidential
election, slated for March 2000, during a Wednesday interview with
Japan's mass-circulation The Yomiuri Shimbun.</P>
      <P>Chen said he would promote a comprehensive dialogue, including
political negotiation, with mainland China if he was elected as
Taiwan's next president.</P>
      <P>Should Chen want to engage in a dialogue with mainland China to
improve cross-Taiwan Strait relations, he must accept the "one China"
principle, Xu said, adding that it is very difficult to hold
bilateral talks if the two parties involved lack a common ground.</P>
      <P>Mainland China is willing to talk about any issue with Chen, if
he accepts the "one China" framework, he said, adding that there will
be no possibility of two-way dialogue if Chen adopts a "one China,
one Taiwan," or "two Chinas" position.</P>
      <P>Responding to Chen's comments, ranking officials with the
Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait,
mainland China's intermediary body in handling bilateral exchanges
with Taiwan in the absence of formal contacts, said Chen's remarks
reflect his political view of Taiwan as an independent political
entity.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SCHOLAR: WITHOUT POLITICAL REFORM, MAINLAND COULD FACE INSTABILITY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New   York,  June  17  (CNA)
(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China will face rising
instability if it fails to undertake significant political reform in
the next decade, said a scholar in an article for the
Philadelphia-based Foreign Policy Research Institute's "Wire" for
July 1999.</P>
      <P>Minxin Pei, a senior associate with the Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace, noted in an article titled "Is China Unstable?"
that mainland China is likely to maintain short-term political
stability despite many signs of potential turmoil.</P>
      <P>But he warned that if no significant institutional change is
undertaken, the mainland "will experience rising tensions that its
current political system will be incapable of handling."</P>
      <P>Pei said that Beijing is now facing two perilous economic
challenges: an insolvent banking system, with the total number of bad
loans at between 25 percent and 30 percent of its gross domestic
product, and rising unemployment.</P>
      <P>In addition to its economic woes, the Chinese Communist Party
(CCP) also faces some structural and institutional weaknesses, such
as a narrower base of support, organizational defects, weak
institutional channels for resolving state-society conflicts and the
absence of effective institutions to resolve conflicts within the
state.</P>
      <P>But the mainland-born scholar said that there are some strengths
that help offset these weaknesses, such as weak opposition to the
CCP, relative elite cohesion, the CCP's formidable powers of control
and a start by Beijing's leaders to tackle long-term problems.</P>
      <P>Pei said that although localized incidents of social unrest are
likely to increase, the CCP should be able to avert significant
political turmoil in the near future.</P>
      <P>Its long-term future, however, is less certain. "Even if the
Chinese government gets through 1999 without a repeat of 1989, it
must soon confront the issue of political reform more seriously,
because the challenges it poses will only increase as time passes,"
he said.</P>
      <P>The scholar said that failure to implement political
institutional reform may lead to rising instability through three
mechanisms, simultaneously or sequentially:</P>
      <P>-- A reduction in economic efficiency and the country's economic
growth rate, which would further exacerbate social tensions and
damage the CCP's legitimacy;</P>
      <P>-- The development of an environment that allows corruption to
worsen, inequality to rise, and poor governance to persist, all of
which could eventually cause a massive social explosion such as that
occurred in Indonesia in May 1998; and</P>
      <P>-- Increased division within "the current moderate-conservative
ruling coalition," as more liberal elements become disenchanted and
frustrated with the slow pace of reform.</P>
      <P>"Although China is unlikely to become another Indonesia today, it
is very likely to become one in 10 years' time if its leaders are
lulled into complacency," concluded the scholar.</P>

successful corporations.

1960: Republic of China President Chiang Kai-shek and US

killing 24 tourists from Taiwan at Qiantaohu in Chekiang Province,
are executed by firing squad.

Britain's Conservative Party.

Confucius' lesson of the day: "A gentleman esteems what is right
as of the highest importance. A gentleman who has valor, but is
without a knowledge and love of what is right, is likely to commit a
crime. A common man who has courage, but is without the knowledge and
love of what is right, is likely to become a robber."</TEXT>

      <P>Taiwan's population is expected to top 22
million by the end of this month, the Ministry of the Interior (MOI)
said on Saturday.</P>
      <P>MOI officials noted that in latest census, the population stood
at 21,993,797 as of the end of May. Of the island's two
municipalities, Taipei City has a population of 2,640,014, while
southern Kaohsiung City has 1,467,773.</P>
      <P>Six counties in Taiwan proper have a population of over 1
million, topped by Taipei County, with 3,481,734. This is followed by
Taoyuan County with 1,667,071, Taichung County with 1,474,236,
Changhua County with 1,302,741, Kaohsiung County with 1,227,971, and
Tainan County with 1,101,890.</P>
      <P>The population as of the end of May had increased by 0.81 percent

County, at 2.375 percent; followed by Taichung City, at 2.018
percent; and Hsinchu City, at 1.421 percent.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SUSPECTED FMD CASES FOUND AMONG CATTLE IN TWO TAIWAN RANCHES</HEADLINE>

(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) which
flared up in cattle ranches in the off-shore island county of Kinmen
is suspected of having traveled to Taiwan, with cattle in two ranches
in Shanhua, Tainan County, almost certainly infected, local
newspapers reported on Saturday.</P>
      <P>Both the United Daily News and the China Times carried front-page
reports that 23 head on two ranches tested positive for FMD
antibodies, a sign indicating the existence of the FMD virus in their
systems.</P>
      <P>As none of the cattle in question had been vaccinated for FMD,
health officials believe the only explanation of the antibodies is
that they are infected with FMD, although this cannot be absolutely
confirmed until a culture of the virus has been grown on samples
taken from the cattle, the reports said.</P>
      <P>Once FMD is confirmed, health officials will vaccinate the cattle
on ranches within a six-kilometer radius of the two affected ranches,
in addition to destroying the infected livestock.</P>
      <P>Putting on a brave face at the prospect of a possible FMD
epidemic among the island's cattle, health officials assured the
public on Saturday that it too early to confirm that an epidemic has
broken out on the island.</P>
      <P>Soong Hua-chun, deputy director of the Bureau of Animal and Plant
Health Inspection and Quarantine said on TV that even if an epidemic
is confirmed, beef and milk can still be consumed safely.</P>
      <P>Noting that the FMD virus is killed by the heat generated in the
cooking process, and will not spread to humans, Soong urged the
public not to worry about consuming local livestock products.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the health officials decided on Saturday to destroy
another 35 head of cattle on a third Kinmen ranch hit by FMD.</P>
      <P>The animals at the Wu Wen-teh ranch will be destroyed on Sunday
and buried at a farm far from the ranch for fear of polluting the
water of the nearby Tienpu Reservoir, which is the island's main
source of drinking water.</P>
      <P>Earlier attempts to incinerate the cattle were abandoned as too
expensive and time-consuming. Kinmen has already slaughtered 132 head
because of the FMD scare.</P>

      <P>Gold mining firms in Australia, the
world's third-largest producer and exporter, are fighting for their
survival as bullion prices have hit a 20-year low of US$260 per
ounce, the Sydney Morning Herald reported.</P>
      <P>The report quoted analysts as saying that low prices have
resulted in the closure of three nickel mines in Kalgoorlie, and
warned that small gold mines will face similar closures if gold
prices continue falling in the months ahead.</P>
      <P>They attributed the plunge in gold prices to a series of sales of
reserve gold by central banks, including the Reserve Bank of
Australia, which has added fuel to the fire following the Asian
financial crisis.</P>
      <P>But other experts dismissed the warning, saying that the
prospects for gold are not too pessimistic because of the economic
recovery in Asia, which is known for its passion for the yellow

    <HEADLINE>SCHOLARS FROM MAINLAND, TAIWAN DISCUSS UNITY IN 21ST CENTURY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 19 (CNA)
(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Scholars from mainland China and Taiwan got
together at Taipei's Grand Hotel on Saturday to exchange views on how
the Chinese should strive for unity and self-reliance in the 21st
century.</P>
      <P>The symposium was organized by the Taipei-based Republic of China
Association for Unity and Self-Reliance.</P>
      <P>Pai Wan-hsiang, president of the sponsoring association, said at
the opening of the symposium that the 21st century will be a century
of freedom and democracy, with advanced scientific and economic
developments.</P>
      <P>He stated that cross-Taiwan Strait relations will affect security
and peace not only in the Taiwan Strait but across the Asia-Pacific
region, and perhaps throughout the world.</P>
      <P>Pai said he hopes relations between Taiwan and mainland China
will develop in a way that brings about unity, mutual benefit and
cooperation in the next century.</P>
      <P>Jiang Denming, head of the mainland Chinese delegation to the
symposium, presented a report in which he called on the Taiwanese
people "to walk away from sorrowful feelings and create the future
together."</P>
      <P>In regard to cross-strait relations, Jiang suggested that both
the mainland and Taiwan handle incidents with responsibility and a
rational attitude, without resorting to political sentiment.</P>
      <P>He proposed that top leaders of the mainland and Taiwan visit the
other side at an appropriate occasion and in an appropriate capacity.</P>
      <P>Participants to the symposium presented reports on how the
Chinese should strive for unity and self-reliance under the themes of
humanitarianism, social development and economic development.</P>
      <P>The scholars from the Taiwan side included Examination Yuan Vice
President John Kuan, China Youth Corps President Jeanne Li, Catholic
Fu Jen University President Yang Tung-ho and National Open University
President Chen Yih-young.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN ENTERS 1999 MUCH STRONGER: BRITISH STRATEGIST</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>London,  June  19   (CNA)
(By Mark Chun-lin Ou &amp; Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan entered 1999 stronger, given the
fact that Beijing has painted itself into a corner with its
diplomatic flops, a British strategist said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Dr. Chris Hughes, a strategist from the University of Birmingham,
told a conference on East Asian security that Beijing's diplomacy has
been following a bumpy road ever since US President Bill Clinton
announced his so called "three noes" policy -- no support for Taiwan
independence, no support for "one China" or "one China, one Taiwan,"
and no support for Taiwan's membership in international groups -- in
June, 1998.</P>
      <P>Branding mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin's visit to Japan
in November, 1998 "a disaster," Hughes said that Jiang has failed to
dissuade Tokyo, which was alarmed by North Korea's missile test over
its airspace in August of that year, from joining a US-led
anti-missile system and expanding its defense cooperation pact with
the US to cover the area around Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Beijing's ties with Washington also took a nose-dive in 1999 over
its alleged theft of US nuclear secrets, its alleged attempt to
influence US politics through illegal campaign contributions, and its
shrill protests over NATO's accidental bombing of its embassy in
Belgrade.</P>
      <P>Beijing's opposition to NATO's air strikes against Yugoslavia
also soured its ties with the Western powers and handed Taiwan, which
usually rallies behind the West on international issues, a favorable
environment to develop ties with the West, said Hughes.</P>
      <P>The British strategist also pointed out that Beijing's missile
testing in waters near Taiwan between 1995 and 1996 has alienated
Taiwan's younger generation.</P>
      <P>They are now more pro-independence than their elders, and this
attitude will probably affect Taiwan's next presidential election in
2000, said Hughes.</P>
      <P>Hughes's point of view was supported by various opinion polls
conducted in Taiwan over the past few years, said Lin Chong-pin, vice
chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council, the Cabinet-level body
which formulates Taiwan's mainland China policy.</P>
      <P>Lin, who was invited to deliver a speech at a conference
organized by the Royal United Services Institute for Defense Studies,
said that the surveys found that Taiwan residents' propensity for
independence peaked during Beijing's missile tests, with a higher
percentage of the people surveyed saying they consider themselves
Taiwanese rather than Chinese.</P>
      <P>In his speech, Lin called the world's attention to Beijing's
efforts to develop information warfare, or what he called
"acupuncture warfare," which he said could paralyze an enemy's
command and communications system with strong electronic pulses.</P>
      <P>Professor Peter Ferdinand from Warwick University aired opinions
similar to those of Hughes at the conference.</P>
      <P>He also said that India's ever deepening mistrust of Beijing, and
North Korea's missile tests, posed serious challenges to Beijing.</P>
      <P>While Beijing has gone to great lengths to persuade Tokyo not to
cooperate too closely with Washington on defense, North Korea's
missile tests have undone this work and have in fact pushed Tokyo in
the opposite direction, said Ferdinand.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAICHUNG BLOCKS PASSAGE OF POWER TRANSMISSION LINE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 19 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Plans for Taiwan's third south-north power
line were blocked by the Taichung County Government, which demanded
from state-run Taiwan Power Co. (Taipower), more than NT$200 million
in compensation for the use of county land, a local TV station
reported Saturday.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan TV station quoted Taipower officials as saying that
the 321-kilometer high-voltage transmission line, which will run from
Tainan County to Taipei County, is to be routed through central
Taiwan's Taichung County.</P>
      <P>Construction of the line, which will require the use of 76
pylons, was to begin in July, though a postponement is expected after
the Taichung County Government refused to rezone the land on which a
pylon would sit.</P>
      <P>Taichung County Magistrate Liao Yung-lai demanded NT$210 million
(US$6.46 million) for allowing the line to pass through Taichung,
according to the station.</P>
      <P>A down payment of NT$60 million (US$1.84 million) must be paid
immediately, while the other NT$150 million (US$4.61 million) can be
paid over the two and a half years that remain in Liao's term,
according to the report.</P>
      <P>In an interview with the TV station, Liao defended his demand,
arguing that Taipower's Taichung Thermoelectric Power Plant, which
burns fossil fuel, accounts for 90 percent of the country's air
pollutants. He said this justifies their demand for compensation.</P>
      <P>Taipower is reluctant to grant Liao's demand for fear that it
will lead to similar demands being made by officials from other local
governments, across whose territory the line will pass.</P>
      <P>They said that Taipower's compensation rules cover only residents
living in the vicinity of the power plants and the local governments
of areas in which the plants are located.</P>
      <P>If residents who live directly under the high-tension cable line
are allowed to press for compensation, it would substantially
increase the costs of power transmission, company officials said.</P>
      <P>The 345,000-volt line, which is intended to carry power from the
south to power-starved northern Taiwan, would supplement two existing
power transmission lines, which are being used at up to 90 percent of
their capacity.</P>
      <P>If the third cable line is not completed before May next year,
Taipower officials warned, northern Taiwan could face a serious power
outage if the two existing lines were to break.</P>

      <P>A report by the Committee of Economic
Research and Development under the Ministry of Economic Affairs
(MOEA) indicated that Malaysia's economy is improving, though its
manufacturing and construction sectors remain sluggish.</P>
      <P>Because Taiwan is the second-largest foreign investor in
Malaysia, next only to Japan, the MOEA report on Malaysia's economic
situation is an important reference material for Taiwan investors.</P>
      <P>In the wake of the 1997 Asian financial crisis, Taiwan's
investment in Indonesia dropped by as much as 90 percent, while its
investments in Malaysia and Vietnam rose 40 percent and 60 percent,
respectively.</P>
      <P>The latest report on the Malaysian economic situation said that
Malaysia's exports have registered continued growth for six
consecutive months, with its foreign exchange reserves soaring to
US$27.2 billion by January this year from US$21.7 billion at the end
of 1997.</P>
      <P>But the report noted that as the manufacturing and construction

    <HEADLINE>HU SAYS IT IS TIME TO MOVE ON KOSOVAR AID PACKAGE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  19  (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>It is time to begin implementing the
Republic of China's US$300 million humanitarian aid package for
Kosovo, despite the controversy that surrounds the plan, said Foreign
Minister Jason Hu.</P>
      <P>The aid package, designed to provide emergency and rehabilitation
assistance to the nearly 1 million refugees displaced by the conflict
in Kosovo, was unveiled by President Lee Teng-hui on June 7. Since
his announcement, the plan has been the target of criticism from
people in almost all walks of life in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The main point in question is whether President Lee made the
decision all by himself without first consulting the Legislative
Yuan, the Executive Yuan, the Foreign Ministry and the Comptroller,
said opposition Democratic Progressive Party presidential candidate
Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>In addition, Chu Li-lung, a lawmaker of the ruling Kuomintang,
pointed out that people are still in doubt as to why an amount of
US$300 million was selected. He also questioned how the aid package
would be implemented and what its consequences would be.</P>
      <P>If the controversy drags on indefinitely, it will undermine the
prestige of the foreign minister, the ruling party, and even the
government, remarked the legislator.</P>
      <P>Hu declined to respond to legislators' questions about how the
decision was made. "The next step is to see 'where the beef is,' and
all the things should be done at least within three to five years,"
he said.</P>
      <P>As to the issue of whether the aid for Kosovo will crowd out
other important government spending programs, Hu noted that "it will
hinge on our wisdom."</P>
      <P>Despite opposition at home, the plan has been welcomed by the
international community judging from international news coverage of
the aid package.</P>
      <P>The aid project has increased Taiwan's international visibility,
stressed Hu, adding that it should be followed up by winning the
international community's goodwill through "near distance"
cooperative experiences and by establishing more bilateral and
multilateral cooperative channels. This will "not be necessarily an
establishment of diplomatic relations; however, the distance between
the two sides will surely be narrowed," he said.</P>
      <P>The foreign minister expressed his hope that a "most transparent
aid program" would be built so that taxpayers' money will be spent
wisely.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  19  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>More than 200 head of cattle from two
breeding farms in Shanhua, Tainan County, were ordered to be
slaughtered Saturday after it was confirmed that members of the herd
had been infected with foot-and-mouth-disease (FMD).</P>
      <P>In a hastily called press conference Saturday afternoon, Peng
Tso-kwei, chairman of the Council of Agriculture (COA), said that the
virus found in the two ranches in Shanhua, Tainan County, was the
same strain of FMD found in cattle in Kinmen County last week.</P>
      <P>Peng said the Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection and
Quarantine under the Council of Agriculture (COA) has instructed the
Tainan County Government to wipe out the cattle herds of dairy
farmers Liu San-ho and Huang Wen-hsiang after FMD antibodies were
found in saliva and blood samples of the livestock.</P>
      <P>The confirmation of FMD in the cattle in Shanhua proved true
health officials' fears that the O-strain that had affected bulls in
Kinmen would make its way across the strait, said Peng.</P>
      <P>Not leaving anything to chance, Peng said his council has ordered
the extermination of all cattle suspected of being infected.</P>
      <P>A campaign to immunize all cattle at ranches within a 6-kilometer
radius of the two cattle farms whose livestock are infected with FMD
will be carried out soon, COA officials said.</P>
      <P>FMD, a contagious disease that plagues cloven-hoofed animals, hit
Taiwan's hog population in 1997. The outbreak crippled Taiwan's hog
farming industry and resulted in the slaughter of more than 4 million
pigs.</P>

      <P>The Taipei City Zoo on Sunday resumed
operations one day after visitors had to be evacuated by rubber boats
and a Taiwan black bear escaped from its compound.</P>
      <P>Despite Saturday's chaos, the Mucha zoo was opened to the public
on Sunday after the facility's staff cleaned up sludge and
sterilized the area.</P>
      <P>Zoo manager Yang Sheng-hsiung said except for the butterfly
exhibition hall, which suffered the greatest damage during the flood,
all areas on Sunday were operating as usual.</P>
      <P>Yang said the zoo's drainage system was unable to handle
Saturday's sudden heavy rainfall, resulting in serious flooding in
many areas. Visitors had to be evacuated by rubber boats for the
first time in the zoo's history.</P>
      <P>While firefighters and zoo personnel were busy evacuating
stranded visitors, a Taiwan black bear swam out of his flooded
compound into the neighboring goat's exhibition area, causing further
panic among the tourists.</P>
      <P>Yang said the flooding in the bear's exhibition area was due to a
closed water gate behind the compound. Yang explained the water gate
is normally closed intentionally in order to prevent stray dogs and
cats from entering.</P>
      <P>Amid Saturday's sudden downpour, Yang said zoo personnel forgot
to open the water gate, forcing the bear to flee his flooded
compound.</P>
      <P>Yang admitted the zoo was caught unprepared by Saturday's events,
however, after this experience, he said the zoo is now ready for
future emergencies.</P>
      <P>Yang said the butterfly exhibition hall will be rebuilt into a
new insect hall, and a complete overhaul of the drainage system will
improve the zoo's drainage capability.</P>

      <P>The new survey titled, "2000 Presidential Election Trend
Investigation" was conducted by the China Statistics Association
(CSA) June 10-11 and polled 1,846 legal voters over the age of
twenty.</P>
      <P>According to the survey, if the presidential election were to be
held the following day, former Taiwan Governor James Soong would
gather 29.4 percent of all votes, followed by the opposition
Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP) presidential candidate, Chen
Shui-bien at 20.2 percent.</P>
      <P>Republic of China Vice President Lien Chan, who was believed to
be the ruling Kuomintang's (KMT) candidate, received support of 19.7
percent, while 30 percent said they were undecided.</P>
      <P>The result was vastly different from previous surveys in which
Soong received 40 percent of all tallies, and is the first poll to
reveal that none of the presidential hopefuls has more than 30
percent voter support.</P>
      <P>However, the opinion poll discovered that while Soong's support
rate was the highest, 43.4 percent of those polled believed that Lien
stood the greatest chance of winning the race, followed by Soong, at
21.4 percent. Only 9.6 percent thought Chen would win.</P>
      <P>In addition, 76.6 percent believed if Soong quit the KMT to run
in next year's presidential election, the DPP's Chen would win.</P>
      <P>One notable aspect of the poll was the five questions concerning
political parties; results show that 60 percent of people acknowledge
political parties play a positive role in the development of
democracy. Only 25 percent disagreed with the statement.</P>
      <P>Another 60 percent believe a multi-party government will cause
more confusion in the political scene, with 33.1 percent disagreeing.</P>
      <P>Party politics is generally thought of in a positive light as
51.2 percent thought that party-elected candidates are better-suited
to guide Taiwan's future political development, with 27.5 percent
saying candidates with no party-affiliation are better.</P>
      <P>CSA official Hsieh Pang-chang concluded at the press conference
that "party politics are now the mainstream," and that "party
transcendence is illusory."</P>

announced on Sunday.</P>
      <P>The current front effecting weather is still lingering over the

    <HEADLINE>COA HEAD CALLS ON MAINLAND TO HELP STOP FMD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 20 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's top agriculture official on Sunday
called on mainland Chinese authorities to join efforts by officials
here to curb the spread of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD).</P>
      <P>Peng Tso-kwei, chairman of the Cabinet-level Council of
Agriculture (COA), urged mainland China to fulfill its responsibility
as a member of the international animal quarantine body, the
International Office of Epizootics, to help arrest FMD on its side of
the Taiwan Strait as the disease has now made its way onto Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Peng hoped that mainland Chinese authorities will face the
reality that the FMD epidemic has spread across the mainland, and
will send virus samples to the FMD Laboratory in Britain for a
thorough examination so as to allow other countries to be informed of
the infection and contribute to eradicating it.</P>
      <P>Citing that no quarantine system is good enough to meet the
threat derived from any single smuggling, Peng called for the Taiwan
public to treasure the country's agriculture economy by helping the
government crack down on smuggling so as to help the government
protect the safety of Taiwan's ecological environment.</P>
      <P>Quarantine officials on Sunday slaughtered 194 head of cattle on
four ranches in southern Taiwan in an emergency measure to check a
possible FMD outbreak among the country's cattle population. FMD last
affected Taiwan cattle in 1929.</P>
      <P>An across-the-board quarantine began on the four ranches Sunday
after the Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection and Quarantine
confirmed Saturday that the virus found on the ranches in Shanhua,
Tainan County, was the same strain of FMD found in cattle on Kinmen
island last week.</P>
      <P>FMD antibodies were found in saliva and blood samples of the
cattle from the four ranches. The confirmation of FMD in southern
Taiwan cattle confirmed health officials' worst fears that the
O-strain of the disease, found in cattle in Kinmen, located close to
mainland China's Fujian Province, had made its way across the strait,
Peng said.</P>
      <P>To stop FMD's spread, the remaining 121 head of cattle on the
four ranches suspected of being infected will be exterminated. In
addition, 60,000 doses of FMD vaccine is being sent to southern
Taiwan for use on all healthy cloven-hoofed livestock animals.
Currently, a campaign to immunize all cattle on ranches within a
6-kilometer radius of the four Tainan ranches is being carried out.</P>
      <P>Tainan County is Taiwan's largest cattle-raising region, with the
cattle population totaling 28,000, about one-fifth of all cattle on
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>If all healthy cloven-hoofed livestock animals in the Tainan
region are injected with the preventive medicine, 120,000 doses will
have to be administered, quarantine officials said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lee Chin-lung, director of the Bureau of Animal and
Plant Health Inspection and Quarantine, said the meat market in
Tainan County should be suspended immediately if the County
government and the ranchers are determined to terminate the deadly
disease once and for all.</P>
      <P>If the iron-grip measures are not taken immediately, the cattle
infection may expand to again damage Taiwan's hog population, a
dreadful prospect for the country's economy, Lee added.</P>
      <P>FMD, a contagious disease that plagues cloven-hoofed animals,
ravaged Taiwan's hog population in 1997, crippling the country's hog
farming industry, the staple source of meat in Taiwan and a major
foreign exchange earner. The outbreak resulted in the slaughter of
more than 4 million pigs.</P>

    <HEADLINE>HAINAN COURT GIVES LIFE SENTENCE TO TAIWAN RESIDENT FOR SPYING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Hong Kong, June 20 (CNA)
(By M.N. Wang and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Taiwan resident recently was convicted
of spying and given a life sentence by a court in the southern
mainland Chinese province of Hainan, the Hong Kong-based Apple daily
reported on Sunday.</P>
      <P>The daily quoted the Hainan Daily, the only official newspaper on
the island province, as saying that Hsiung Tien-chun was given a life
sentence by the Hainan Secondary People's Court after he was found
guilty of spying for the Taiwan military.</P>
      <P>According to the Hainan newspaper report, Hsiung, also known as
Pu Fan, was discovered to be connected with Taiwan's Military
Intelligence Bureau (MIB) after he continuously collected classified
military, political and economic information for Taiwan authorities
under the guise of travel, private visits and business trips to and
from mainland China between 1990 and 1997.</P>
      <P>The report said in June 1995, Hsiung bribed Xi Shihguo, an
official with the Hainan provincial government, into joining a
Taiwan-based US company, owned by Hsiung's uncle. Xi was hired to be
a consultant to the firm.</P>
      <P>Under the financial lure, the report said, Xi allowed Hsiung into
his office many times between July 1996 and March 1997 to Xerox and
photograph official and classified documents on mainland China's
political, economic and social situation.</P>
      <P>Hsiung also arranged for Xi to travel to Bangkok in October 1996
to meet with MIB agents to exchange information. Xi was awarded an
unknown amount of money for his treason, the report continued.</P>
      <P>The Hainan report, however, did not mention when and where Hsiung
was arrested on the espionage charges. It also did not state whether
Hsiung was given an open trial for his alleged activities.</P>
      <P>The report said that Xi was also given a life sentence
for espionage activities.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's business and industrial sectors
would suffer grave losses if mainland China launched a boycott of
exported commodities from Taiwan, sources from the Industrial
Development Bureau (IDB) reported on Sunday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan will face a loss equivalent to 7.64 percent of its total
annual export trade if mainland China imposes a boycott on imports
from Taiwan, said the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research (TIER),
which was contracted by IDB to do research on product competition and
inter-reliance between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The loss of 7.64 percent was valued at around US$7.7 billion if
based on 1998 export figures, said TIER researchers.</P>
      <P>In addition to Taiwan's exported goods, related up-stream

    <HEADLINE>WASHINGTON-BEIJING RIFT AFFECTS US-ROC ARMS ISSUES: SCHOLARS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   June   20  (CNA)
(By Wendy Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Recent rifts in Washington-Beijing
relations make the United States more cautious in dealing with
sensitive Taiwan issues such as the theater missile defense (TMD)
system, Taiwan scholars said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The Sino-American Cultural and Economic Association (SACEA) held
a symposium Sunday morning to discuss Taiwan's contingency measures
after the Washington-Beijing rift.</P>
      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP) international
affairs department head Hsiao Mei-chin pointed out that while
US-PRC relations are strained for the time being, their long-term
strategic partnership still exists.</P>
      <P>Academia Sinica fellow Chiu Chao-lin said judging from the
triangular relationship between Washington, Beijing and Taipei over
the past twenty years, whenever a Washington-Beijing strain was
caused by a Taiwan issue, the United States tended to concede to
pressure from the PRC.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, if the Washington-Beijing rift was caused
by the PRC the US also cooled its relations with Taiwan, Chiu
said.</P>
      <P>The recent US bombing of the mainland Chinese embassy in
Yugoslavia and the alleged mainland Chinese espionage activities
in the US has plunged Washington-Beijing relations to a new low, she
said.</P>
      <P>In addition, anti-PRC sentiment has risen in the US, and
President Bill Clinton's China policy is under attack as well. Under
present conditions, she predicted such sensitive issues as the TMD
system will become a pawn in US-China negotiations and that
Washington will also shirk from its Taiwan policies.</P>
      <P>Hsiao said that the triangular relationship between Washington,
Beijing and Taipei could never be "parallel;" whether US-PRC
relations improve or regress, Taiwan, which is caught in the middle,
will never wield any influence.</P>
      <P>Especially when the US deliberately ignores that sovereignty is
the main issue of disagreement across the Taiwan Strait, Taiwan will
always be caught in a dilemma, she said.</P>
      <P>Hsiao pointed out the sovereignty issue is the "zero-sum" game
across the Taiwan Strait, with no possibility of concession from
either side. She suggested the Republic of China (ROC) government
consider which issues can be freely discussed by both sides.</P>
      <P>For example, she said, peace, economy and the direct trade,
postal and transportation links are mutually beneficial issues, and
therefore Taiwan should be prepared to raise these issues when
negotiating.</P>
      <P>Chang Wu-yueh, the director of Tamkang University's school of
mainland affairs, said Taiwan is in no position to reject negotiations
with mainland China, and that once at the negotiatiig table, Taiwan
should emphasize the unreasonable restrictions the mainland has
placed on negotiations over the political difference of both sides.</P>
      <P>Mainland Association for Relations Across the Strait (ARATS)
Chairman Wang Daohan's fall visit to Taiwan is a crucial
international moment, Chang said. He suggested the ROC government use
Wang's visit to open up cross-strait dialogue.</P>
      <P>Whether during Wang's visit the negotiations are "constructive
dialogue" insisted by Taiwan, or the mainland's so-called "political
dialogue," and no matter how polarized the two sides' standpoints
would be, Chang said that as long as there is dialogue with mainland
China, Taiwan will have the chance to present its stance to the
world.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Malaysian immigration authorities
announced the country will open a visa issuing office in Taiwan's
southern city of Kaohsiung in order to facilitate businessmen there
in applying for Malaysian visas.</P>
      <P>Malaysian immigration officials made the revelation Sunday at a
dialogue with representatives of the association of Taiwan
businessmen in Malaysia.</P>
      <P>At present, the Malaysian representative office in Taipei handles
an average of 2,000 visa cases per day.</P>
      <P>Malaysia decided to open a visa issuing office in Kaohsiung in
view of the fact that Kaohsiung and Kota Kinabalu, the capital city
of Malaysian state of Sabah, have direct air links, as well as the
fact that more and more businessmen in southern Taiwan do business in
Malaysia.</P>
      <P>During their talks, Chen Huang-kun, president of the association
of Taiwan businessmen in Malaysia, suggested that Malaysian
immigration authorities extend the effective period of a landing visa
to one week from the current 72 hours and solve some technical
problems in the issuing of visas.</P>
      <P>Chen also urged Malaysian immigration authorities to give Taiwan
school principals and teachers in Malaysia one-year visas, instead of

    <HEADLINE>FORMER DPP CHIEF CALLS FOR IMMEDIATE "THREE LINKS"</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  20 (CNA)
(By Bear Lee)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
chairman Hsu Hsin-liang on Sunday said that Taiwan should immediately
rescind its ban on the cross-strait "three links" and boldly make an
inroad into the mainland market.</P>
      <P>Hsu quit Taiwan's main opposition party in May in preparation for
his run as an independent in Taiwan's next presidential election in
2000 after the DPP was sure to nominate former Taiwan mayor Chen
Shui-bian as its candidate.</P>
      <P>In his "Taiwan's 21st Century Economic Policy Guidelines", Hsu
said mainland China is emerging as one of the biggest markets in the
world and that only by taking a greater share of the mainland market
can Taiwan become an economic power.</P>
      <P>Otherwise, he warned, the island will turn out to be a mere
"factory" that only produces goods for others, a prospect that is
sure to lose the mainland market and its future as well.</P>
      <P>The "three links" refers to direct trade, postal and
transportation connections between Taiwan and the mainland. Taiwan
currently bans the three links for national security reasons.</P>
      <P>Hsu said that compared to other major economic powers now
aggressively exploring the mainland markets, Taiwan owns advantages
due to the short geographic distance between the mainland and Taiwan
as well as the common cultural and historical backgrounds.</P>
      <P>Hsu criticized the government's current "no hurry, be patient"
mainland investment policy, which he said has restricted the
development of cross-strait economic and trade relations and will
further undermine Taiwan's competitive edge in the mainland market.</P>
      <P>He suggested a restructuring of the government to upgrade its
efficiency and a full opening of the country's capital and services
markets in order to effectively face the challenges of the next
century.</P>

    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  June  19 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A free and democratic Taiwan has outraged
communist and totalitarian China, creating all sorts of headaches for
tranquility in Asia, a senior Canadian journalist said.</P>
      <P>Norman Webster had once been barred from visiting Taiwan because
he was previously based in Beijing. "Thirty years on, I'm finally
here," he said in an Taipei-datelined article appearing on the
Saturday edition of The Gazette of Montreal.</P>
      <P>Things change. Trade and culture now link the mainland and
Taiwan. "The problem is that Beijing still considers the island to be
an integral part of China and will not stand for talk of Taiwanese
independence.</P>
      <P>"It is, trust me, the only issue besides Tibet that rouses
Chinese officials into red-faced fury. It makes them go ballistic --
literally -- as happened in 1996, when an outraged Beijing lobbed
missiles into the Taiwan Strait," he noted.</P>
      <P>If Taiwanese sometimes seem paranoid about their large cousin,
there's a reason: China really is out to get them, he observed.</P>
      <P>Most leaders in Taiwan play things cautiously, hoping not to
provoke the dragon more than necessary, said Webster. "Taiwanese
independence?" says President Lee Teng-hui. "That will get everybody
into trouble."</P>
      <P>"Tall, trim, 76 years young, Lee is a standing provocation to
Beijing because of his popular election in 1996. This made him the
first democratically elected head of state in China's 5,000 or so
years of history," he wrote.</P>
      <P>He said the days of Chiang Kai-shek's dictatorship are long gone;
today's Taiwan throbs with political activity and a free press.</P>
      <P>"China is a stagnated society," Lee told a group of us,
journalists attending the annual assembly of the International Press
Institute, he added.</P>
      <P>He went on quoting Lee, "Taiwan is the breakthrough in long-run
Chinese history. China has to learn from us. Taiwan now is the good
example."</P>
      <P>Lee's formula: reunification with the mainland can be
contemplated when China itself becomes democratic. How long might
that take? "Maybe 20 years, 25 years, one generation. In China, we
take our time to make our changes," Lee was quoted again.</P>
      <P>Another helpful suggestion from the president, who will retire
from office next year, is that China be divided into seven fully
autonomous regions: Taiwan, Tibet, Mongolia, Xinjiang, Manchuria,
northern China and southern China. "Beijing has received the idea
with gritted teeth," said Webster, a former editor of The Gazette.</P>

      <P>The temperature around Taiwan in May as
measured by 22 weather stations island-wide was found to be from 0.6
Celsius degrees to 1.6 degrees below average, according to an
official weather report.</P>
      <P>The drop in temperature rarely occurs in Taiwan, due to the
island's location off the east coast of Asia and in the path of warm
ocean currents. Normally Taiwan has an oceanic and subtropical
monsoon climate, said the report of the Central Weather Bureau (CWB),
issued in the Sunday-version of the local United Daily.</P>
      <P>The report says since 1990, except for once in April of 1996,
monthly temperatures have not fallen below average. Meteorologist
Chen Kuei-hung of the CWB's weather forecasting department doubted
the climate change is a result of the La Nina effect.</P>
      <P>Since 1990, the seas around the island have been detected to be
increasingly warming due to a global warming affect, Chen said. He
noted, however, the global climate pattern has been disturbed since
last July by El Nino's accompanying cold currents.</P>
      <P>Chen said his department discovered the water around Taiwan began
cooling in May. Temperature readings from seas on the eastern coast
of Taiwan in May averaged 26 Celsius degrees, one degree below
normal.</P>
      <P>However, Chen would not forecast this summer will be cooler than
past years. He said, the CWB foresees Taiwan's temperatures in both
June and July to be the same temperature as past years.</P>

(By Tony Fang and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China on Taiwan formally
joined the International Council for Small Business (ICSB) on Sunday,
becoming the 11th chapter of the world trade body.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan delegation will be using its official designation, the
"ICSB-ROC," in future ICSB-sponsored meetings and activities to share
Taiwan's expertise and experience in the small business arena, said
John Ni, director-general of Taiwan's Medium and Small Business
Administration.</P>
      <P>Ni is currently leading a 14-member Taiwan delegation to the
ICSB's 44th annual conference, now being held in the central Italian
city of Naples. The four-day conference opened Sunday.</P>
      <P>Ni said the Republic of China's becoming a formal branch of the
ICSB is of major significance to Taiwan's medium and small
businesses. In the future, Taiwan will not only contribute to all
ICSB activities, but also seek to play host to the ICSB's annual
meeting in 2001, he noted.</P>
      <P>During a meeting of ICSB board directors and supervisors on
Sunday, the Australian executive board director proposed that Taiwan
be permitted to join the group with the official designation of
"ICSB-ROC." The proposal was passed overwhelmingly, according to Ni.</P>
      <P>Although the ICSB has only 11 chapters so far, it has some 2,000
members from over 80 countries and areas around the world.</P>
      <P>During this year's meeting, which is being attended by over 500
delegates, the ROC delegation will present three research papers.</P>

      <P>Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou will visit
Hong Kong later this year to speak at a forum, a major Hong Kong
newspaper reported on Monday.</P>
      <P>Sing Tao Daily quoted sources as saying that when Paul Yip,
special adviser to Hong Kong Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa, visited
Taiwan earlier this year, he and Ma agreed that private exchanges
between Taipei and Hong Kong should be increased and suggested
setting up a twin-city forum to promote economic and cultural
exchanges between the two places.</P>
      <P>The report said that Yip invited Ma to visit Hong Kong to speak
at the forum, and Ma accepted the invitation gladly. The twin-city
forum will probably be held in September or October.</P>
      <P>Yip assured Ma that if he visits Hong Kong as a private citizen,
there would be no visa problems.</P>
      <P>Ma visited Hong Kong in early March this year. During his brief
stay there, Ma attracted great media attention. Though his visit was
private, the former chairman of the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs
Council met with several prominent political leaders and inspected
the infrastructure of the former British colony.</P>
      <P>Ma, who was born in Hong Kong and moved to Taiwan at the age of
1, visited Hong Kong in early 1997 to trace his roots. He also tried
to visit in June 1997 prior to Hong Kong's return to mainland Chinese
rule, but he was denied a visa, even though he held no official
position at that time.</P>

      <P>The Australian government is planning to
change its migration rules by allowing foreign students to take up
jobs as an incentive to lure full-fee-paying students from Asia and
other regions, according to a leading population expert.</P>
      <P>Bob Birrell, director of the Center for Population and Urban
Research at Monash University in Melbourne, said in a report that the
proposed changes to the way skilled migrants are selected could have
a direct impact on graduates majoring in accounting, computing,
engineering, law, nursing and public relations.</P>
      <P>He said past experience in Australia, the United States and
Canada indicated that most of these graduates from Third World
countries will take up opportunities for permanent residence if they
arise.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BABY BOY SUFFERING FROM RARE DISEASE PASSES INITIAL CRUCIAL PERIOD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  21  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A 1-year-old boy suffering from a rare
hereditary disease has passed though an initial, crucial period, a
doctor from National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH) said Monday.</P>
      <P>Dr. Lu Meng-yow, the NTUH pediatrician in charge of caring for
the boy, said that the boy underwent a transplant involving umbilical
cord blood on June 3 in an operation that was the first of its kind
in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The boy has grown since the transplant, and on Monday he was
allowed to leave an isolation room and enter the general ward for the
first time. The boy, Lin Po-chih, suffers from Type II
"mucopolysacchoridosis," also known as MPS.</P>
      <P>With a stable white-blood-cell count of more than 10,000 and
after having undergone a successful blood transplant -- more properly
known as a "cord blood stem cell" procedure -- the boy is thought to
have passed through the first, crucial period, Lu said.</P>
      <P>Lu said that if Lin's condition continues to improve, he will be
discharged from the hospital within one month.</P>
      <P>Lin's mother said she was grateful to see that her son has become
healthy and stronger, and that he has developed an appetite. She said
she was sad, though, that the same procedure administered to Lin
could not be administered to two older sons, who also suffer from
MPS. They are considered too old to qualify for the procedure.</P>
      <P>MPS is a hereditary genetic disorder caused by a lack of a
special enzyme, or body protein. The particular enzyme deficient in
someone with MPS is responsible for helping to break down
"mucopolysacharide," a kind of sugar found in cells and tissues.</P>
      <P>When sugar is not broken down properly, it accumulates in the
body and can affect appearance, bodily functions, and both mental and
physical development.</P>
      <P>Depending on what parts of the body are affected by the sugar
buildup, MPS can eventually result in death. The normal life
expectancy for someone with the condition is 10 to 20 years, as there
is no cure for the condition.</P>

    <HEADLINE>STRIKING CONTRAST SEEN IN PARLIAMENTS OF TAIWAN, CHINA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  June  21  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>There is a striking contrast in the
parliaments of Greater China, with people in Taiwan able to enjoy the
fun of the chamber while their brothers in both Hong Kong and
mainland China do not have the same fun, according to The Australian
Financial Review.</P>
      <P>In a dispatch from Taipei, correspondent Rowan Callick reported
the contrasts are stark. In Hong Kong, most members of parliament are
selected by pro-Beijing bodies, so the legislature can always be
counted on ultimately to back the administration.</P>
      <P>In Beijing, the parliament meets annually in the Great Hall of
the People, but the people are kept out by a ring of soldiers, the
daily reported.</P>
      <P>Callick reported that despite last week's fist fights in Taiwan's
parliament, people in Taiwan are no longer fond of brawling in the
parliamentary chamber.</P>
      <P>He quoted an unnamed parliamentary clerk as saying that much of
the infamous violence was originally intended to ensure that TV
viewers took note of their new representative and the extent of his
or her passion. "But today, TV viewers don't like to see that sort of
thing, and the members have learned to control themselves."</P>

    <HEADLINE>SHANHUA CATTLE MARKET CLOSES FOR 10 DAYS OVER FMD INFECTION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Tainan,   southern   Taiwan,  June 21  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Tainan County
Government on Monday ordered the closure of the decades-old cattle
market in Shanhua for 10 days after the discovery of foot-and-mouth
disease (FMD) infection at two cattle ranches in the township.</P>
      <P>The county government said in an administrative decree that all
cloven-hoofed animals are subject to the trading ban on the
Shanhua cattle mart from June 21 through June 30.</P>
      <P>During the period, the county government said, vehicles and
personnel are banned from entering the marketplace. Moreover, no
ailing or deceased animals can be placed there, and no assemblies or
social activities can be staged during the 10-day period.</P>
      <P>Shanhua is now Tainan county's only animal trade mart.
Nevertheless, cattle trade on the mart has declined steadily in
recent years. Trade in non-cattle products and other activities have
replaced cattle trade as major events seen on the Shanhua mart.</P>
      <P>County government officials said those who violate the ban will
be given a prison term of less than a year plus a fine ranging
between NT$30,000 (US$923) and NT$150,000.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the ROC Dairy Industry Association held an emergency
meeting at the Liuying dairy industry zone in Tainan County Monday
morning to discuss measures to prevent the FMD infection from
spreading to Liuying from Shanhua.</P>
      <P>The Liuying special zone accommodates a total of 82 ranches which
raise more than 12,000 head of dairy cows. The Shanhua FMD outbreak
has caused concern among dairy farmers in the Liuying area.</P>
      <P>Wu Ming-hsuan, president of the ROC Dairy Industry Association,
said the association will send a letter to the Cabinet-level Council
of Agriculture (COA) urging it to inoculate all dairy cows in Tainan
County against FMD virus as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Wu said dairy farmers in the Liuying area are worrying about a
further spread of the FMD infection because the county government's
animal disease control department is giving top priority to
inoculating cattle raised in ranches located within 6 kilometers
around Shanhua.</P>
      <P>Noting that locally produced beef and dairy products are mainly
for domestic consumption, Wu said dairy cows have high economic
value. "Each cow is worth more than NT$100,000 in market value," he
said, adding that he hopes the COA will provide the Tainan County
Government with additional FMD vaccines soon to help curb further
spread of the epidemic.</P>

      <P>The government, schools and families should
all play a role in stopping students from joining gangs, Education
Minister Yang Chaur-shin said at the Legislative Yuan on Monday.</P>
      <P>The newly-appointed minister was invited to speak on his

It was Yang's first report at the Legislative Yuan since he assumed
office last week.</P>
      <P>The recent funeral of a former gang leader in which nearly one
hundred teenagers attended dressed in black or white was the main
topic of Monday's legislative session. During the session,
legislators wanted an explanation for the infiltration of gangs into
local schools.</P>
      <P>Yang replied that he is distressed over student participation in
gangs. He said students should be receiving an education at school;
instead, due to various factors, they are now unable to learn
contendly at school.</P>
      <P>Yang said the government, schools and families are all
responsible for the growing influence of gangs.</P>
      <P>He said that the Ministry of Education (MOF) has arranged
"practical skills" classes for students unable to concentrate on
their studies in a normal school environment.</P>
      <P>But he also pointed out that practical skills classes alone
cannot lead students back to school. A complete set of measures is
required to allow young people to study contentedly once they return
to school.</P>

(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Kaohsiung City lottery tickets, if
printed abroad and imported into Taiwan, will be seized as
instruments of gambling, said a ranking official at the Ministry of
Finance (MOF) on Monday.</P>
      <P>It was reported that the six million lottery tickets for use by
Kaohsiung City, a metropolis in southern Taiwan, might be printed
overseas and then imported into Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Yen Ching-chang, a vice minister at the MOF, said that all
tickets printed abroad will be detained by the customs as instruments
of gambling according to the 45th article of the Tariff Statute.</P>
      <P>Yen told the press at the Legislative Yuan that the proposed
action is absolutely in accordance with the law. According to the
current law, the issuance of lottery tickets must have the approval
of the MOF; therefore, lottery tickets not approved by the MOF are
deemed as instruments of gambling, the vice minister added.</P>
      <P>Yen went a step further pointing out that according to the law,
contraband items are not allowed to be imported; hence, MOF's
accusation of gambling by the Kaohsiung City government under article
269 of the criminal law earlier this month was completely in
accordance with the law.</P>
      <P>As to whether MOF has already ordered customs authorities to
seize the lottery tickets, Yen remarked that a seizure does not have
to be ordered. Since the tickets are contraband items, customs
authorities will carry out their duties and seize all illegal
imports.</P>
      <P>The ongoing skirmish over the Kaohsiung lottery represents the 
latest battle of a long-term turf war between the central and local
governments for control of various aspects of administration.</P>
      <P>It also seen as a political struggle between the island's two
main parties in light of the fact that the mayorship of Kaohsiung is
held by a member of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DOMESTIC VIOLENCE PREVENTION LAW TO BE IMPLEMENTED THIS WEEK</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  21 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Two short films were aired during a press
conference on Monday to raise public awareness that domestic violence
should no longer be endured in silence.</P>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou and Legislator Hsieh Chi-ta, a women's
rights advocate, attended the press conference co-sponsored by Taipei
Women's Rescue Foundation and Taipei City Government's Bureau of
Social Affairs</P>
      <P>Both Ma and Hsieh wore a purple ribbon to symbolize their support
of domestic violence victims and their determination to eradicate
domestic violence.</P>
      <P>Law enforcement and medical representatives at the press
conference also wore purple ribbons to indicate support for human
rights and their opposition to violence. The representatives vowed to
establish a protective net for abused women.</P>
      <P>The showing of the two films marked the start of a series of
activities prior to the official implementation of the domestic
violence prevention law on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Ma, who narrated the film produced by the foundation, said that
according to the domestic violence prevention law, the abuser will be
required to keep a distance from the residence and working place of
the victim, as well as be banned from communicating or meeting with
the victim to safeguard their safety.</P>
      <P>Ma said Taiwan's divorce rate is the highest in Asia, and
domestic violence is part of the reason. He reiterated that domestic
violence is no longer a matter within a family and the new law
provides a just manner to punish abusers.</P>
      <P>Participants also announced that two telephone numbers
080-024-995 and 2700-9595 can be used to report cases of domestic
violence.</P>
      <P>Statistics showed that in Taiwan, on the average 20 women daily
suffer from domestic violence. Most of the cases involve physical
abuse. From June 1998 to June 1999, 126 people died due to domestic
violence.</P>
      <P>An investigation into the causes of domestic violence showed that
38.3 percent of the abused blamed their spouses for having an
inclination toward violence, while 32.1 percent attributed their case
to poor communication with their spouses.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MEAT TRADE CONTINUES IN TAINAN COUNTY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Tainan,   southern   Taiwan, June  21  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Tainan County
Government on Monday decided not to suspend meat trade in the county,
despite the discovery of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) in three cattle
ranches in Shanhua township.</P>
      <P>Lee Kuo-tang, chief secretary of the county government, made the
announcement after calling a meeting of relevant officials. Lee
chaired the meeting on behalf of Magistrate Chen Tang-shan, who is
now on an overseas trip.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture (COA) has suggested that
the county close its meat market for a short period of time to
protect local hog ranches from being infected with the FMD virus.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Lee said agricultural and animal disease control
officials in the county thought that it's not necessary at least at
the moment to ban meat trade in the local market because the FMD
outbreak has been effectively controlled.</P>
      <P>Wu Wu-chiou, director of the county government's agriculture
department, said the "type O Kinmen" FMD virus that infected cattle
raised in Shanhua area has not spread because of effective control
measures taken by the county government. "The virus is not expected
to affect pigs raised in our county."</P>
      <P>Moreover, Wu said as Tainan County ranks third in Taiwan in terms
of hog production, its hogs have been sold to other areas around the
island. "It's meaningless to solely suspend pork trade in Tainan
County," he noted.</P>
      <P>Chen Ching-wen, head of the county's meat market management
department, said all meat marts in the county have intensified
sterilization and stepped up inspection of pig ranches in order to
minimize the risks of a further spread of the disease.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the COA has asked major FMD vaccine importers to
import additional 400,000 doses to meet the demand.</P>
      <P>The COA has also decided to subsidize the Kinmen and Tainan
county governments in slaughtering all FMD-infected cattle or dairy
cows.</P>
      <P>Under current law, the county or city government must compensate
farmers whose hogs or cattle are slaughtered to curb the spread of
contagious diseases. Farmers can get full cash compensation for
their healthy animals and three-fifths of the market value for
ailing animals.</P>
      <P>A total of 158 head of cattle raised in the offshore frontline
island of Kinmen were already slaughtered last week and the number
of dairy cows and cattle to be slaughtered in Tainan County over the
FMD scare is estimated at 315.</P>
      <P>The compensation for all these animals will reach several tens
of millions of New Taiwan dollars. As both Tainan and Kinmen county
governments have been troubled by cash shortage, the COA has agreed
to offer up to 50 percent of the needed funds to help resolve the
compensation issue. The current market price for a beef cattle
ranges between NT$50,000 and NT$60,000, while that for a milk cow is
about NT$100,000.</P>
      <P>The spread of "type O Kinmen" FMD virus to Tainan has triggered
a panic among cattle and hog ranch operators in the neighboring
Kaohsiung county.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung county animal disease control officials have stepped
up FMD tests on livestock, including dairy cows, milk goats and
hogs, raised in the county.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung health officials have so far collected more than 260
serum samples of dairy cows and milk goats raised in Luchu, Tashe,
Yenchao, Chiaotou and several other villages or townships neighboring
Tainan County for FMD tests.</P>
      <P>County officials have also urged hog farmers to stay high alert
on possible FMD attack on their animals.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung County has 85 dairy goat ranches, which raise a total
of 20,000 goats, and 42 milk cow farms, which raise 8,000 cows.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Zhou Yongjun, a permanent US resident
and former student leader of the 1989 Tiananmen pro-democracy
movement, is serving a three-year term in an education-through-labor
camp in mainland China.</P>
      <P>The Hong Kong-based Information Center of Human Rights and
Democratic Movement in China said Monday that Zhou disappeared in
late December after he tried to slip into mainland China from Hong
Kong to see his parents, and that he recently sent a letter to his
wife, saying that he was sick in the labor camp. But he did not say
in the letter why and when he was sent to the camp.</P>
      <P>Zhou, who was imprisoned for two years after the 1989 Tiananmen
incident, fled to the United States through Hong Kong in 1993. He and
his family were living in New York as permanent US residents before
he was found missing in late December, the information center said.</P>
      <P>The information center also said that several dissidents were
rounded up by police in the eastern city of Hangzhou Saturday when
they were talking at a tea house. Among them were two members of the
outlawed "China Democracy Party", whose whereabouts are unknown.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MEETING CALLED TO DISCUSS GOVERNMENT MARITIME POLICY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 21 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Research, Development and
Evaluation Commission (RDEC) will call a meeting on Tuesday to
overhaul the government's maritime policy.</P>
      <P>More than 120 scholars, experts, government officials, and
opinion leaders are expected to take part in the two-day event, and
conclusions reached in the meeting will be used as references for the
RDEC to modify a draft of the ROC government's first-ever white paper
on maritime policy.</P>
      <P>The RDEC move comes one year after Premier Vincent Siew issued
instructions at a national seminar on maritime policy that relevant
government agencies should work out a comprehensive policy in an area
considered especially important, given Taiwan's position as an island
nation.</P>
      <P>After a year of research, the RDEC has recently completed a
preliminary draft of the ROC's first official white paper on maritime
policy, focusing on marine environmental protection and development,
national defense, and assistance in the event of maritime
catastrophes.</P>
      <P>However, the issue of whether the government should set up a
specific agency in charge of maritime affairs remains undecided
because it is a vast area currently covered by 15 government
agencies, including the Ministry of the Interior, the Ministry of
National Defense, the Ministry of Finance, the National Science
Council, and the Mainland Affairs Council.</P>
      <P>RDEC Chairman Wei Chi-lin said that before any such maritime
affairs agency is set up, it is vitally important that the 15
government agencies should continue to make concerted efforts to
carry out their respective missions relating to maritime affairs.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Executive Yuan has already decided to establish a
coastal patrol agency with an aim of cracking down on smuggling and
illegal immigrants and protecting Taiwan fishermen, starting early
next year.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's workforce was rated the fifth best
in the world for the fourth year in a row by a Swiss rating agency,
the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) announced on Monday.</P>
      <P>Among the 49 countries assessed by the Business Environment Risk
Intelligence (BERI) in its annual "Labor Force Evaluation Measure",
Taiwan ranks behind only Singapore, Switzerland, Belgium and Japan,
said the MOEA.</P>
      <P>The other two Asian states listed among the 49 states were South
Korea, at the 13th spot, and mainland China, at the 40th position.</P>
      <P>The BERI rated a country's workforce according to "legal
framework", "relative productivity", "worker attitude" and "technical
skills." These areas accounted for 30 percent, 30 percent, 25 percent
and 15 percent respectively in the survey.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's legal framework scored the third highest after Singapore
and Belgium.</P>
      <P>Relative productivity was based mainly on a country's
productivity per day and daily working wage. In this category, Taiwan
moved up four spots into sixth position, after Singapore, the United

    <HEADLINE>CONSCRIPTS TO BE DISCHARGED AHEAD OF SCHEDULE FROM 2000</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  21 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of National Defense (MND) is
working on a program under which conscripted men will be discharged
from their mandatory military service one or two months ahead of the
schedule.</P>
      <P>Vice Defense Minister Wu Shih-wen made the statement Monday
during a meeting of the Legislative Yuan's interior affairs
committee.</P>
      <P>If all goes smoothly, Wu said, the program can be finalized by
the end of this year and implemented from early next year.</P>
      <P>To cope with the excess number of male adults available for
conscription, Wu said, the MND has decided to allow some enlisted
men to be discharged one or two months ahead of the schedule.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Wu said, the ministry would not consider
shortening military service at the moment.</P>
      <P>"Wu must conduct a comprehensive review of military manpower
demand before we mull whether to shorten the current two-year
mandatory military service," Wu said, adding that the current
law must also be revised to pave the way for shortening
compulsory military service.</P>
      <P>In view of the complexity involved in the military service
reduction, Wu said the MND would not consider the proposal at the
moment.</P>
      <P>According to an MND estimate, about 20,000 conscripts can be
discharged from the military ahead of the schedule in the initial
stage.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, Interior Minister Huang Chu-wen
said his ministry and the MND have jointly worked out a program for
implementing an "alternative military service" system under which
about 10,000 conscripts will be able to serve in non-military units
to replace their compulsory military service.</P>
      <P>Huang told lawmakers that the long-talked-about "alternative
military service system" will be put into practice from July 1,
2000.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LEE PRESENTS REPORT ON NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT TO NATIONAL ASSEMBLY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  21  (CNA)
(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China (ROC) President Lee
Teng-hui on Monday presented his views on the nation's foreign policy
while presenting a five-point guide on national development to the
National Assembly.</P>
      <P>Lee described "facing reality" as the first principle for
handling Taiwan's foreign relations. Under this principle the fact
that two separate administrations exist on the mainland and Taiwan is
recognized. The principle states that both sides should be treated as
equal political entities.</P>
      <P>The four other guiding principles are:</P>
      <P>-- "Doing whatever the country should do," under which the ROC
will strive for its own interests based on the consensus of its
citizens, and will not impose self-restrictions due to oppression
from mainland China;</P>
      <P>-- "Flexibility and pragmatism," under which Taiwan will
positively participate in international organizations and activities
on an equal and mutual beneficial level;</P>
      <P>-- "Parallelism," under which Taiwan will not challenge mainland
China, but will jointly take part in international organizations and
activities; and</P>
      <P>-- "Unchanged stance," under which Taiwan will try to enlarge its
international space, to create a favorable environment, and to attain
reunification under the concepts of freedom, democracy and equitable
wealth.</P>
      <P>Lee said that the government will promote "all
people's diplomacy" and "comprehensive diplomacy" by using the ROC's
democratic accomplishments and economic power.</P>
      <P>Lee's report to the National Assembly, the last one before the
expiration of his tenure of office in May of next year, contained nine
major themes: constitutional reform, government reorganization,
improvement of defense power, stable economic development,
strengthening of social security, development of education, culture,
science and technology, utilization of natural resources, exploration
of external affairs, and promotion of cross-Taiwan Strait relations.</P>
      <P>In spite of some natural disasters and company failures caused by
the Asian financial crisis during the past one year, Lee said the
situation has recovered due to the efforts of related government
units.</P>
      <P>He went on to say that US President Bill Clinton's visit to
mainland China and mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin's trips to
Japan and the United States posed new tests for Taiwan, but the
government has effectively responded to the developments.</P>
      <P>Lee also took credit for the troubl-free elections last December
of legislators and mayors in both Taipei and Kaohsiung, last
October's mainland trip by Straits Exchange Foundation Chairman Koo
Chen-fu, and Taipei's US$300 million pledge to Kosovar refugees.</P>
      <P>In general, he stated, the country's development in all fields
during the past year has displayed a new face, producing confidence
for the country as it marches into the 21st century.</P>
      <P>On the development of cross-strait relations, Lee said that Koo's
visit to the mainland last year revived the channel of systematic
communications after a three-year suspension.</P>
      <P>He said the forthcoming Taiwan visit by Wang Daohan, chairman of
the Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Strait, will be helpful for cross-strait relations.</P>

      <P>Council of Agriculture (COA) Chairman Peng
Tso-kwei on Monday urged Hsinchu animal disease prevention
authorities to raise vaccination rates in local ranches to prevent
any outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) in this northern county.</P>
      <P>Peng also called on owners of animal ranches to stay on high
alert and vaccinate their herds, as the "0 Kinmen" type of FMD virus
recently found in cows on three ranches in the southern Taiwan county
of Tainan had been transmitted from the outlying island of Kinmen.</P>
      <P>The COA head, however, stressed that the cases on Taiwan proper
do not constitute an epidemic, as the infected Tainan cattle have all
been slaughtered.</P>
      <P>Peng made the remarks during an inspection tour of the Hsinchu
County Disease Prevention Center.</P>
      <P>Peng lamented the latest FMD outbreak, a little over two years
since an FMD epidemic wiped out a large percentage of Taiwan's hog
population.</P>
      <P>Although Hsinchu animal disease prevention officials briefed Peng
that the percentage of the county's pig population which has received
"O type" Taiwan pig FMD vaccine has increased from 60 percent in May
to 79 percent in June, Peng urged local stockmen to vaccinate their
entire herds in order to help prevent a fresh epidemic on the island.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that the COA has approved the distribution of more
than 1.7 million vaccines for Hsinchu County alone.</P>
      <P>He also expressed the hope that the establishment of a coastal
patrol force early next year will help the Hsinchu authorities carry
out their disease control mission more efficiently.</P>

said on Monday.</P>
      <P>Tai Huo-shan, general manager of Union Finance International (HK)

      <P>Tai pointed out that in the wake of the Asian financial crisis

tightened their restrictions on corporate credit, providing an
opportunity for Taiwan banks.</P>
      <P>He said that after the representative office is upgraded to a

    <HEADLINE>NO OPINION POLLS TO BE PUBLISHED DURING PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  21  (CNA)
(By Wendy Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Central Election Commission (CEC) of
the Republic of China passed a draft amendment on Monday stipulating
that no opinion polls can be published during the 28 days of the
official presidential election campaign period.</P>
      <P>The draft amendment to the Presidential and Vice Presidential
Election and Recall Law was made to prevent a flood of polls from
swaying public opinion before the 2000 presidential election, the CEC
said.</P>
      <P>The amendment stipulates that no political parties, private
citizens or corporations are allowed to publish opinion polls on
candidates' popularity ratings or result predictions during the
28-day presidential campaign period and before the voting deadline.</P>
      <P>The draft also stipulates that voters must have resided in their
constituencies for a minimum of six months, up from the
previous four months, to be eligible to vote for their area's
candidate.</P>
      <P>To clean up Taiwan's election environment, the draft amendment
further stipulates that convicted gangsters, and those with criminal
records relating to illegal drugs or firearms are not allowed to run
for office within ten years of their pardon or the end of their
sentence.</P>
      <P>In addition to meting out even more stringent punishments for
election bribery, a collateral punishment clause has been added to
the draft amendment for political parties whose elected candidates
have been charged with election bribery.</P>
      <P>The draft amendments are slated to be included on the agenda of
next week's Legislative Yuan session.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, CEC member Peng Huai-en (New Party) made a motion to
expand the amount of the presidential election deposit, and the CEC
settled on two alternatives to be put before the Ministry of the
Interior: a set amount of NT$15 million, or one-thirtieth of the
total campaign funds.</P>
      <P>However, the CEC agreed in principle that the election deposit
should not exceed the amount of the last election, for fear of
critics slamming the staggeringly high election deposit restriction a
"rich man's clause."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China President Lee Teng-hui on
Monday described the US$300 million-worth of aid pledged to Kosovar
refugees as "the chance of a thousand years," and urged the public to
have empathy, as well as a broader mindset.</P>
      <P>Lee made the remarks at a National Assembly meeting during which
he gave his last State of the Nation address, listened to the
suggestions of the assembly deputies, and explained his decision
earlier this month to pledge the aid to refugees from the Yugoslavian
province of Kosovo. Lee's term expires in May next year.</P>
      <P>On accusations from the public that the decision was too rash,
Lee said that since the start of NATO airstrikes on Yugoslavia on
March 24, the Kosovo refugee problem had worsened, to the concern of
the ROC government.</P>
      <P>He said the National Security Council had therefore asked the
Ministry of the Interior and the agencies under the Executive Yuan to
form a task force to study various assistance proposals over a
two-month period.</P>
      <P>Lee said that the amount of US$300 was decided at that time, and
that as Premier Vincent Siew was visiting Central American and
Caribbean countries at the time, it was decided on June 7 that he
himself would make the announcement.</P>
      <P>Lee said that since the ROC is determined to help the Kosovar
refugees, a delayed announcement would have compromised the effect of
such assistance.</P>
      <P>Lee said that the task force studied various assistance proposals
and took "several factors" into consideration. In view of Taiwan's
limited land area, he said, allowing refugees to live here was
unfeasible, especially since the number of refugees was increasing
daily.</P>
      <P>The president said that the ROC government therefore decided
instead to provide vocational training for refugees who would come
here only temporarily, so that they could start businesses upon
return to their homelands.</P>
      <P>Faced with criticism from certain quarters, Lee said only that it
is normal for people in a democratic country to express their
opinions, and added that in any case, the assistance offered by the
ROC in the past has been less than that offered by some other
countries. In addition, the aid plan will be spread over a three-year
period, which he said will not place any extra burden on the nation's
finances.</P>
      <P>He stressed that to move forward, Taiwan needs to have the
attitude of a big country, and that there would have been "no second
chance" if his plan had not been announced immediately.</P>
      <P>The president also urged the leaders of mainland China to
identify with the ROC's approach, saying that both sides should "join
hands to help others," because extending a hand to such countries
will display the dignity of a nation with a broad "international
mindset."</P>
      <P>He further defended his aid plan by noting that the Vatican has
praised it.</P>

    <HEADLINE>OPPOSITION DISAPPOINTED BY PRESIDENT'S STATE OF NATION ADDRESS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 21 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The two opposition parties in the Republic
of China's National Assembly on Monday expressed disappointment over
President Lee Teng-hui's State of the Nation address, describing it
as "overcautious."</P>
      <P>Liu Yi-teh, whip of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Caucus
in the National Assembly, said the report, the last of its kind
before Lee's four-year term ends next May, was short on
constitutional reform, and long on routine affairs of the government.</P>
      <P>The DPP was especially frustrated by Lee's apparent satisfaction
with the progress of the constitutional reforms, which Liu said is in
complete contrast to the DPP's view.</P>
      <P>Characterizing Lee's report as more like a premier's boring
report to the Legislative Yuan on the day-to-day affairs of
government than a president's farewell speech to the National
Assembly, Chen Chin-teh, another DPP heavyweight in the National
Assembly, said it focused too much on trivialities, and lacked vision
for the country's future.</P>
      <P>The other opposition party represented in the National Assembly,
the New Party, shared the DPP's view, with its caucus whip Ching
Chi-hua saying that the president's report neither reviewed the work
of constitutional reform over the last 11 years, nor mapped a path
for his successor.</P>
      <P>The New Party Caucus whip at the Legislative Yuan, Legislator
Cheng Lung-shui, said Lee has demeaned himself by presenting to the
National Assembly a report which "dodges the real issues and has
nothing new."</P>
      <P>Branding it an exercise in bells-and-whistles about democracy
which totally avoided addressing the problems of the dominance of
gangsters and billionaires in the nation's politics and the
deterioration of "financial discipline," Cheng said Lee's report
should have emphasized the problems which arose during his
presidency.</P>
      <P>Although he presents his report to the National Assembly and is
supposed to listen to suggestions made by its members, the president
is under no legal obligation to act upon those suggestions.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US INVESTMENT IN TAIWAN GREW SHARPLY IN FIRST QUARTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  21  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's relative stability during the
Asian financial upheaval has made it a magnet for foreign capital,
with investment from the United States surging by 128 percent in the
first quarter of this year, the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA)
said on Monday.</P>
      <P>Compared with the corresponding period of last year, overall
foreign investment in Taiwan has increased by 41.57 percent, with the
lion's share, or 38.2 percent, going to the electronic and electrical
appliance industries, said the MOEA.</P>
      <P>Besides the United States, other foreign states have also
funneled more capital into the island, with investment from The
Netherlands up 51 percent, and Singapore investment showing a 31
percent increase.</P>
      <P>The only state to buck the trend is Japan, which saw its
investment in the island decline by 30 percent in dollar terms,
despite a 22 percent growth in the number of projects with Japanese
investment.</P>
      <P>A survey conducted by the MOEA of Taiwan's principal foreign
investors shows that they are generally satisfied with the island's
business environment, with many of the foreign investors who also do
business in Southeast Asia or South Korea saying that they consider
Taiwan a more favorable place for investment.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC PREMIER URGES BEIJING TO RESOLVE PRACTICAL CROSS-STRAIT ISSUES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  21 (CNA)
(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Premier Vincent Siew on
Monday urged Beijing to resolve pressing practical cross-Taiwan
Strait issues through systematic negotiations.</P>
      <P>The premier said the negotiations should be resumed as soon as
possible so that practical issues such as the transmission of
foot-and-mouth disease from the mainland to Taiwan through smuggled
cattle, and the repatriation of hijackers and illegal immigrants,
could be resolved.</P>
      <P>Siew made the remarks in a speech delivered at a dinner party
organized by Taipei's Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) for over 100
Taiwan businessmen doing business in mainland China.</P>
      <P>He expressed the hope that Beijing will resume systematic
dialogue to resolve practical problems so that mutual trust and a
mechanism for cross-strait peace and stability can be established.</P>
      <P>Referring to a Beijing proposal that the two sides hold political
talks to terminate hostilities, Siew stated that all issues relevant
to democratic reunification can be raised at this autumn's meeting
between SEF Chairman Koo Chen-fu and Chairman Wang Daohan of
Beijing's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS).</P>
      <P>The SEF and ARATS are semi-official organizations set up by
Taipei and Beijing, respectively, to handle cross-strait exchanges in
the absence of formal ties between the two sides.</P>
      <P>Turning to the island's economic development, Siew declared that
Taiwan has emerged safely from the Asian financial crisis, evident in
the fact that this year's real economic growth rate has been revised
upward to over 5 percent.</P>
      <P>He told the participants that the government will speed up
reforms in the political, economic and social fields, and added that
the results of these reforms will serve as powerful support for
people from Taiwan who conduct business on the mainland.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A number of local people believe that
communist China most likes to see former Taiwan Governor James Soong
elected the Republic of China's next president, according to the
results of a public opinion poll released on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The telephone poll of 1,070 adults, conducted by the ROC College
Professors Association, found that 21.62 percent of the respondents
believe that Soong is Beijing's favorite choice for the ROC's next
presidency.</P>
      <P>Slightly more than 16 percent said they think that mainland
China prefers to see Vice President Lien Chan's capture of the ROC's
top leadership post next year.</P>
      <P>Only 3 percent of those interviewed said they believe Beijing
would be happiest to see former Taipei Mayor Chen Shui-bian become
Taiwan's next president.</P>
      <P>Survey results also show that 61 percent believe communist China
would use every possible means and opportunity to influence the
ROC's coming presidential election scheduled for March 2000, roughly
three times the number of those who said they don't think so.</P>
      <P>As high as 70 percent said they are convinced that relations
across the Taiwan Strait will affect Taiwan's overall national
security and development, and more than 50 percent said they believe
the outcome of Taiwan's next presidential election will have a
significant impact on the cross-strait relationship.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 71 percent said they think that all presidential
hopefuls are obligated to present a clear, comprehensive policy on
relations with mainland China.</P>
      <P>Asked which party's mainland policy will most benefit Taiwan
people, about 30 percent chose the ruling Kuomintang; 6.45 percent
opted for the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party (DPP);
1.78 percent cited the pro-unification New Party; and 0.19 percent
chose the Taiwan Independence Party. Nevertheless, nearly 40 percent
said they do not know which party's mainland policy will benefit
ROC nationals most.</P>
      <P>Among the four possible presidential hopefuls, Lien wins most
trust in formulating a mainland policy that can best serve
Taiwan people's interests and rights, with 22 percent choosing him.</P>
      <P>In comparison, 17.6 percent said they think that Soong, who is
widely believed to break ranks with the KMT to run as an independent
in next year's presidential election, is most capable of presenting
an effective mainland policy to protect Taiwan's interests.</P>
      <P>Chen, who will represent the main opposition DPP in the coming
presidential election, came in third, with 13.8 percent recognizing
his ability to present a mainland policy conducive to Taiwan's
interests; while Hsu Hsin-liang, a former DPP chairman who renounced
his DPP membership in May to run for the presidency on his own, won
the trust of a mere 2.34 percent of the respondents in this regard.</P>
      <P>Asked who will be most capable of handling cross-strait issues,
22.14 percent throw their support behind Lien; 20.46 percent opt for
Soong; 13.64 percent choose Chen; and only 1.87 percent support Hsu.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ANIMAL HEALTH OFFICIAL WARNS RECENT FMD OUTBREAK A THREAT TO PIGS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  22  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan Research Institute for Animal
Health (TRIAH) warned on Tuesday that the foot-and-mouth disease
(FMD) outbreak that recently hit the offshore island of Kinmen and
southern Tainan County could pose an even greater risk to hogs than
to cattle or goats.</P>
      <P>The institute conducted a test last week to determine whether
Taiwan's pig population would be susceptible to the "type O Kinmen"
FMD strain that recently hit in Tainan County, said TRIAH Director
Lin Shih-yu. All seven pigs exposed to the virus became infected,
which means Taiwan's pig population is at risk, he said.</P>
      <P>Noting that the Tainan County Government has decided against
closing its meat market, Lin said he worries that the decision may
result in FMD spreading from cattle to hogs, noting that pigs at meat
markets are often kept in the same pens as cattle.</P>
      <P>The FMD outbreak, which was first spotted at three ranches on
offshore Kinmen Island, has resulted in the slaughter of 158 head of
cattle on the island, while it is expected that more than 300 cattle
in Tainan County will be slaughtered as a result of the outbreak.</P>
      <P>Lin said TRIAH, the only institute in Taiwan that is capable of
conducting FMD tests, is closely monitoring the situation, adding
that it will soon complete tests on serum samples sent by 63 ranches
from seven cities and counties.</P>
      <P>Tainan County Government and meat market officials met Tuesday
again to discuss the situation amid a warning by the Council of
Agriculture (COA) that the Tainan County Government and meat market
officials should be held responsible for the further spread of the
disease since they are against closing the market.</P>
      <P>Lee Kuo-tang, chief secretary of the county government, said that
if the COA wants it to close the market for a short period, it should
specify which days it wants the market closed. Lee said another
problem is the business losses that meat market shop owners would
face, adding that the market was already closed for three days
because of the long weekend last week.</P>
      <P>Lee said pigs raised in Tainan County have been sent to meat
markets all over the island, adding that it is pointless to ask
Tainan County to suspend pork trading alone.</P>
      <P>COA officials went to Tainan County Tuesday afternoon to discuss
the matter with local officials.</P>

improving the people's lives, and facing up to new challenges during
his next five-year term.</P>
      <P>For his part, Chien conveyed President Lee Teng-hui's
congratulations to Muluzi, and pointed out that Malawi has made
noticeable progress, particularly in the fields of education and
medical care, since Muluzi assumed the presidency in 1994.</P>
      <P>At the same time, construction of a hospital funded by the ROC is
scheduled to be completed by the end of this year, while an ROC
medical assistance mission will be stationed soon in Malawi to help
run the hospital, he said.</P>
      <P>On Sunday night, Vice Malawian President Justin C. Malewezi held
a banquet in honor of Chien and other ROC delegates. More than 20
ranking Malawian government officials were present.</P>
      <P>Douglas Hsu, Malawi's honorary consul in Taipei and chairman of
the Far Eastern Group, offered a briefing during the banquet on
recent ROC developments.</P>
      <P>The ROC has been affected less than other countries by the Asian
financial crisis, and it sits on one of the world's largest foreign
exchange reserves, he said, adding that Taiwan's flexible small
business sector is the major reason the country has been able to ride
out the storm so well.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NEXT STAGE OF DEMOCRATIC REFORMS HINGE ON DPP: CHEN SHUI-BIAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 22 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Presidential hopeful Chen Shui-bian of the
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) said on Tuesday that the next
stage of democratic reforms in Taiwan must be conducted by the DPP.</P>
      <P>In an interview with a local radio station, Chen also said that
there was nothing new in President Lee Teng-hui's last report on the
state of the nation to the National Assembly Monday.</P>
      <P>Chen said that Lee has contributed to Taiwan's democratic
reforms, adding that he has laid the groundwork. But one cannot
expect Lee or his heir apparent to continue such reforms, and only
another party can be expected to continue the mission, he said.</P>
      <P>He also criticized the US$300 million aid package for Kosovar
refugees announced recently by Lee, saying that the president did not
clearly specify where the money would come from.</P>
      <P>Chen also questioned whether the aid might be an attempt to
solidify relations with Macedonia, the newest ally of the ROC. He
also questioned whether the aid was based on humanitarian or
strategic concerns.</P>
      <P>Chen repeated the DPP's vow to either abolish the National
Assembly or merge the legislature and National Assembly into a
unicameral parliament. He noted that there are 535 congressmen and
senators in the United States, which has a population of 260 million,
while there are 559 legislators and National Assembly deputies in
Taiwan, which has a population of 21 million.</P>
      <P>Next year's presidential election will result in a resurgence of
political party rivalry, he said, adding that people running as
independents have no chance of winning.</P>
      <P>Chen said he does not rule out the possibility of Vice President
Lien Chan forming a ticket with former Taiwan Provincial Governor
James Soong.</P>
      <P>Soong's current popularity would drop as a result of his running
with Lien, though, he said, adding that by running with the current
vice president, Soong's image as a reformer could be seriously
compromised.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>If the location of Taiwan's eighth naphtha
cracking plant is determined by the end of this year, the total
amount of investment in major projects around the nation should
exceed last year's record of NT$470 billion, sources from the
Ministry of Economic Affairs said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Major investment projects are defined as those over NT$200
million.</P>
      <P>A total of NT$250 billion was poured into major investment
projects from 1995 to 1997. In 1998, NT$470 billion was invested,
sources said.</P>
      <P>Since January through May of this year, investment capital has
totaled NT$170 billion, a decline of 29 percent compared to the same
period last year.</P>
      <P>However, besides the naphtha cracking plant, another 15 projects
worth approximately NT$100 billion, are slated to begin construction
in the fall. When the naphtha cracking plant finally begins
construction, total investment in major projects in Taiwan should hit
a record high.</P>
      <P>The location for the eighth naphtha cracking plant is still
under evaluation, with southern Taiwan's Pingtung the most likely
choice.

Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chang Yao-tsung, director-general of the Statistics Department,

      <P>Taiwan's total industrial value increased 10.76 percent in May
over the same period last year, the first double-digit growth since

      <P>The growth was attributed to a robust performance by various
sectors, including manufacturing, which grew 12.03 percent, and
housing construction, which was up 7.14 percent.</P>
      <P>The electric and electronics sector grew 24.28 percent as a

    <HEADLINE>DPP CAN BECOME TAIWAN'S RULING PARTY IN NEAR FUTURE: ING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  22 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Nita Ing, chairwoman of Taiwan High-Speed
Railway Corp. (THSRC), said on Tuesday she believes that the
opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) will be able to win the
mandate to rule Taiwan in the near future.</P>
      <P>The outspoken business executive made the statement during a
seminar with a group of DPP party workers and public office holders.</P>
      <P>Ing said she has consistently held a special affection for the
DPP because she has grown up with the DPP since she returned to
Taiwan 22 years ago.</P>
      <P>"History will record the DPP's brilliant contributions to
Taiwan's democratization, liberalization, openness and progress over
the past decade," Ing said, adding that she knows many people in
all walks of life support the DPP in private and expect the party to
work out a comprehensive national development plan to pave the way
for its capture of the ruling power.</P>
      <P>Ing said she feels that Taiwan is still overshadowed by
authoritarian rule. "My observation is that there are still many
legal restrictions obstructing our national development and that
collaboration of ruling party officials and government
administrators has adversely affected Taiwan's overall development,"
she added.</P>
      <P>Noting that the government controlled many key industries in
the past, Ing said such practice has left many drawbacks, including
kickbacks, irregularities in bidding for public construction
projects and mixed use of government and party resources.</P>
      <P>To further promote Taiwan's democratic development, Ing said
Taiwan must endeavor to establish a sound civil service system and
devote even more energy to teaching the younger generation the
tenets of true democracy.</P>
      <P>Ing went on to say that the ruling Kuomintang's
behind-the-scenes maneuvering, particularly some actions taken by
KMT chief financier Liu Tai-ying, has affected the THSRC's
fund-raising for the high-speed railway project.</P>
      <P>Stressing that Taiwan's high-speed railway is now the world's
largest BOT (build-operate-transfer) project, Ing said the THSRC is
most concerned about price and technological know-how in selecting
its electric engineering system, either a German-French hybrid
system or a Japanese system.</P>
      <P>Ing further said the THSRC, a private industrial consortium
which won the US$13 billion contract to build the island's first
high-speed rail system last year, will do its utmost to make the new
railway meet the public demand and expectations.</P>
      <P>According to the contract signed by the THSRC and the Ministry
of Transportation and Communications (MOTC), the 345-kilometer
high-speed railway must be completed by 2003.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Ing said the premise for that deadline is that
construction on the new railway got started in 1997. "Completion in
2003 is just a goal," she noted.</P>
      <P>The THSRC already began construction on the high-speed railway's
southern Taiwan depot and several other minor construction work, but
many core tasks have yet to get underway.</P>
      <P>Ing said she hopes the government will resolve several
controversial issues, including that the proposed construction of a
depot in Hsichi, Taipei County, would violate the existing hillside
conservation law and that the new railway would divide the Tainan
Science-based Industrial Park now under construction into two parts.</P>
      <P>According to a THSRC-MOTC agreement, the MOTC must resolve the
six remaining technical issues, including the above-mentioned two,
before the end of June to enable the THSRC to start its civil
construction in the second half of this year.</P>
      <P>Ing said she hopes the government will honor its promise to
fulfill its duties in time. As for fund-raising, Ing said she is
confident that the THSRC will be able to raise enough funds for the
project.</P>
      <P>Noting that the high-speed railway is Taiwan's first BOT
project, Ing said it requires concerted efforts from the
government, the THSRC and bank consortium to ensure its success.</P>
      <P>Under the BOT formula, private companies will carry out the
construction and operate the public service system for a set period
of time, after which the system will be turned over to the
government.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan police scored major points Tuesday
in an islandwide gang bust, arresting nine suspected gang members
thought to have infiltrated Taipei schools, including some of the
city's most prestigious high schools.</P>
      <P>Amid a recently increased gang presence in area schools, the
National Police Administration (NPA) under the Ministry of the
Interior ordered a nationwide bust, targeting gangs suspected of
infiltrating schools and teen-age gangs.</P>
      <P>The operation began at daybreak, and by 10 a.m. police had
arrested nine suspects, including four suspected leaders of northern
Taiwan's largest teen gang, the "Eastern Union."</P>
      <P>Police said that gang has been the most active in trying to
establish itself in city schools, adding that the gang has even set
up a special branch to recruit students from Taipei City's most
prestigious high schools.</P>
      <P>The gang has 500 members, of whom 300 are students, according to
police statistics. Student members range from the junior-high-school
to the university level.</P>
      <P>An initial police investigation revealed that over 30 junior- and
senior-high schools and universities have been infiltrated by the
Eastern Union, including nearly 10 prestigious institutions.</P>
      <P>In addition, police discovered that many of the student gang
members belong to prominent families in Taiwan's political and
financial circles, and some are the children of high-ranking police
and judicial officials.</P>
      <P>An NPA spokesman announced that police are confident they can
completely wipe out the gangs' presence from city schools. He also
urged parents to pay more attention to their children, and urged
schools to cooperate with police in resisting school-infiltration
attempts by gangs.</P>

    <HEADLINE>WASTE DISPOSAL AMENDMENTS FORM LEGAL BASIS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL POLICE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  22 (CNA)
(By Wendy Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China legislature Tuesday
passed several amendments to the Solid Waste Disposal Act that serve
as the legal basis for an environmental protection agency police
force that will go into effect July 1.</P>
      <P>To establish a legal basis for the environmental police to
conduct solid waste inspections and issue penalties by July 1, the
Legislative Yuan raced to pass amendment drafts to the Solid Waste
Disposal Act during the final session of the current legislature on
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The amendments stipulate that environmental investigative
officials will have the right to inspect any area where they suspect
waste is being illegally disposed of, provided they have proper
identification. They may also demand relevant documents from
manufacturers suspected of illegal waste disposal.</P>
      <P>If necessary, investigators can confiscate machinery and
equipment that produce serious pollution, as well as place limits of
the use of property and real estate, and cut off a building's supply
of water and electricity.</P>
      <P>In addition, the amendments call for even more stringent
penalties for illegal solid waste disposal. Those who dump hazardous
waste that results in a loss of life may be sentenced to life
imprisonment.</P>
      <P>The amendments also stipulate that if waste disposal agencies
violate the law, the companies whose waste they have disposed of must
shoulder collateral penalties as well.</P>
      <P>Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Tsai
Hsung-hsiung encouraged the public to actively inform authorities of
illegal waste disposals to help protect the environment. He also
warned manufacturers not to take chances with improper waste
disposal.</P>
      <P>The EPA also announced on Tuesday that two illegal dumping sites
in southern Taiwan contain cancer-causing agents. One site is in
Chiayi's Hsinkang township, while the other is under an old iron
bridge near the Kaoping River.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A large-scale exhibition of the fabulous
ancient terracotta soldiers from mainland China is expected to be
held at the National Museum of History (NMH) in Taipei next year, the
United Evening News reported on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>In a dispatch from Beijing, the paper said that the Museum of
History in Xian in northwestern China has tentatively agreed to lend
the treasures to the Taipei museum for public display as part of its
efforts to promote cultural and academic exchanges across the Taiwan
Strait.</P>
      <P>According to the paper, the loan promise was made during a visit
to the Xian museum on Monday by a delegation of officials from
various Taiwan cultural institutions headed by NMH Director Huang
Kung-nan.</P>
      <P>The vast army of terracotta soldiers were first unearthed in the
early 1970s from the Chin Dynasty (221-207 B.C.) burial site of
China's first imperial emperor, Chin Shih Huang, who commissioned the
sculptures to guard his final resting place.</P>
      <P>Huang said Taiwan has previously requested to exhibit the
soldiers, but the Xian museum turned down all the earlier requests
apart from loaning just a few of the sculptures for a Taipei
exhibition in December 1992. This time, he said, the museum agreed to
the proposal for a much larger undertaking. According to Huang,
mainland China's Ministry of Cultural Affairs and the State Council
are also expected to approve the proposal.</P>
      <P>The evening paper said the Xian museum may also agree to lend
some newly unearthed colored terracotta soldiers to the Taiwan
museum.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan delegation visited major museums, libraries and
related cultural institutions in Nanjing, Shanghai, Xian and Beijing
during its 11-day tour, and managed to reach several agreements with
mainland Chinese cultural institutions, including an NMH exhibition
beginning on July 2 of ancient paintings and calligraphic works
belonging to the Nanjing Museum of History.</P>
      <P>The delegation was composed of senior executives of the NMH, the
provincial library in Taichung, the Changhua Cultural Center and the
Keelung Cultural Center, as well as officials from the Council of
Cultural Affairs, the Ministry of Education, the Mainland Affairs
Council and the Straits Exchange Foundation.</P>

      <P>Seven mainland Chinese nationals who
intended to make way into the United States with forged travel
papers were intercepted at Taiwan's Chiang Kai-Shek International
Airport late Monday night.</P>
      <P>The Airport Police Bureau announced the breaking of the case on

      <P>Airport police said they have since intensified checks of
suspicious transit visitors' travel papers. In the past,

    <HEADLINE>AUST.  OBSERVER  SEES  MILITARY  BACKING  MEGAWATI</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  June  22  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Indonesia's military led by Defense
Minister General Wiranto is likely to support Megawati Sukarnoputri
to become president later this year, a leading Australian observer of
the June 7 elections predicted.</P>
      <P>In his article published by the Australian Financial Review on
Tuesday, Kevin Rudd, a federal member of Parliament from the Labor
Party, and one of the Australian Parliamentary Observers' Team during
the Indonesian elections, predicted Megawati's party PDI-P will win
between 210 and 220 seats of the 462 available seats in the House of
Representatives or DPR.</P>
      <P>He projected the ruling Golkar and its Islamic allies will end up
with between 200 and 210 seats from the elections. The remaining
30-40 seats will go to the Islamic Modernist Party -- PAN -- led by
Amien Rais, together with the 38 seats still appointed by the
military, Rudd said.</P>
      <P>He gave his reasons why the ABRI or Indonesian armed forces
would support Megawati instead of other presidential alternatives,
including B.J. Habibie.</P>
      <P>First, the army has real concerns about Golkar's abandonment of
the religious pluralism of the Pancasila period and its all too rapid
embrace of Islam as a sort of formal state orthodoxy, he said.</P>
      <P>Second, the army genuinely fears the political reaction of urban
Java, particularly the prospect of violence on the streets if Golkar
just manages a victory -- having to rely in the end
on the army's seats in the MPR or the People's Consultative
Assembly for the win.</P>
      <P>"Siding with Mega, from General Wiranto's perspective, may be the
lesser of the two evils," he added.</P>
      <P>He believed the three greatest problems -- corruption, collusion
and nepotism -- would be more tackled under Megawati than under
other political alternatives.</P>
      <P>"Megawati is only likely to become president with ABRI's support.
This will affect the pace and depth of any program fully to
civilianize the role of the Indonesian military," he said.</P>

      <P>Mining exploration spending plunged 17
percent to only A$193 (US$129) million in the first three months of
this year from a year ago due mainly to the falling commodity prices
worldwide, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS).</P>
      <P>The ABS figures show that exploration spending was 40 percent
lower than two years ago. The plunge of commodity prices was led by
gold, diamonds, uranium and iron ore.</P>
      <P>"Companies have to cut expenditure where they can and one area of
discretionary spending is exploration. But in the long term, they
need to explore to survive. (The actions) are understandable but if
it continues for much longer, it will harm the viability of the
industry," said Dick Wells, chief executive of the Minerals Council
of Australia.</P>
      <P>ABS officials attribute the falling spending to the drop in
demand for Australian commodities from Asia due to the financial
crisis since the middle of 1997. They said the long-term outlook
remains optimistic because of the current recovery in the region.</P>

    <HEADLINE>WHITE PAPER STRESSES ROC SOVEREIGNTY OVER DISPUTED ISLANDS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 22 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Research, Development and
Evaluation Commission (RDEC) released on Tuesday a draft of the
Republic of China's first white paper on maritime policy.</P>
      <P>The white paper, which stresses the ROC's jurisdiction over the
disputed Spratly Islands in the South China Sea, also points out that
the ROC is willing to jointly develop the region's natural resources
with neighboring countries based on a peaceful and rational
framework, and will seek a solution through diplomatic channels to
determine the jurisdiction of the overlapping areas of the territory.</P>
      <P>The RDEC also emphasized that the Tiaoyutai Islands, which lie to
the northeast of Taiwan, are also ROC territory, and detailed
historical links between the ROC and the islands to prove its case.</P>
      <P>The major purpose of the white paper, RDEC Chairman Wei Chi-lin
said, is to remind ROC nationals of their forgotten territory, and to
set a course for the country's maritime policy in light of Taiwan's
strategic position in the Asia-Pacific region.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile on Tuesday, the RDEC also called a meeting of more than
120 scholars, experts, government officials, and opinion leaders to
discuss the draft's contents. Conclusions reached at the two-day
event will be referred to the Executive Yuan for use as guidelines in
setting the final content of the white paper in September.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN AMONG 12 NATIONS ALLEGEDLY DUMPING STEEL PRODUCTS IN US</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  June  21  (CNA)
(By Herman Pan and David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>US Commerce Secretary William Daley
said on Monday that the US government has begun an investigation into
alleged dumping of iron and steel products by 12 nations, including
mainland China and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Daley made the statement on the eve of a US Senate vote on an act
filed by Senator John D. Rockefeller IV (D-W.Va.) to set quotas for
imported iron and steel products.</P>
      <P>Since last September, the US iron and steel industry has spent at
least US$10 million on lobbying in Washington, D.C. to urge lawmakers
to pass a bill to restrict the import of foreign iron and steel.</P>
      <P>The US House of Representatives adopted the bill to this effect
on March 17.</P>
      <P>The US Senate was scheduled to vote on Tuesday on a similar act
filed by Rockefeller, and the Clinton administration has expressed
concern about the outcome of the vote.</P>
      <P>Daley reiterated in a news conference held at the Congress that
the passing of the bill would have a harmful effect on the US
economy. The unilateral setting of import quotas also violates the
norms of the World Trade Organization and would probably ignite a
trade retaliation war between the US and its trade partners, said
Daley.</P>
      <P>The US Iron and Steel Union was scheduled to stage a mass
demonstration at Capitol Hill on Tuesday to pressure Congress to pass
Senate Bill No. 395, filed by Rockefeller.</P>
      <P>Senator Arlen Specter (R-Pa.), the co-signatory of the
Rockefeller act, said it is very possible that the act will pass the
Senate vote. However, he added, whether the act will win a two-thirds
majority vote that President Clinton cannot veto is still uncertain.</P>
      <P>The Clinton administration has previously hinted that the
president will use his veto right if both the Senate and the House of
Representatives pass the bill.</P>
      <P>The main purpose of the bill, which would remain in effect for
three years, is to ensure that the volume of US imported iron and
steel returns to the average monthly import level of three years
before the Asian financial crisis which began in July 1997.</P>
      <P>In order to achieve the goal, Clinton will have take measures
such as unilaterally setting import quotas, raising import tariffs,
and negotiating on bilateral import quotas.</P>

    <HEADLINE>COA WELCOMES TAINAN COUNTY'S DECISION TO SUSPEND MEAT MARKET</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 22 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council of Agriculture (COA) welcomed a
decision by the Tainan County Government on Tuesday afternoon to
suspend cattle and meat markets in the southern Taiwan county in an
effort to prevent any further spread of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD).</P>
      <P>Peng Tso-kwei, chairman of the Cabinet-level COA, expressed
relief upon learning of the decision, describing it as wise, although
difficult for cattle raisers, slaughterhouses and meat dealers, at a
time that eradication of FMD is more important than financial gain.</P>
      <P>Tainan County government officials and representatives of the
Tainan County Meat Dealers Association reached consensus on a
suspension of the regional meat market for 10 days from Wednesday
until June 29.</P>
      <P>The COA suggested last Saturday that Tainan County temporarily
suspend meat trading after an FMD alarm was raised upon the
confirmation of FMD infection among cattle on four ranches in the
county.</P>
      <P>However, it took county officials and meat traders the subsequent
four days to agree with the suggestion, with officials saying a trade
closure will not help arrest the FMD virus, and meat traders saying
the market suspension will only benefit unlicensed or black-market
butchers and meat traders.</P>
      <P>Quarantine officials began to monitor 58 cattle ranches in seven
southern counties and cities after FMD was reported on a ranch in
Shanhua, Tainan County last week. As of Tuesday, no FMD antibodies
had been found in cattle on the surveyed ranches except for the four
in Tainan County.</P>
      <P>FMD, a contagious disease that plagues cloven-hoofed animals,
ravaged Taiwan's hog population in 1997, crippling the country's hog
farming industry, the staple source of meat in Taiwan and a major
foreign exchange earner. The outbreak resulted in the slaughter of
more than 4 million pigs and a ban on exports of pork products.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  22 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Lee Teng-hui on Tuesday offered
to meet mainland Chinese leaders for a "golf summit," to help ease
tension across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Lee said he hoped that his offer will be conveyed to the mainland
Chinese authorities by Taiwan businessmen on the mainland.</P>
      <P>The president made the remarks during a ceremony to mark the
teeing-off of the First Taishang (Taiwan businessmen) Cup Golf
Tournament in Linkuo, Taipei County.</P>
      <P>In his speech to some 160 businessmen and government officials
taking part in the tourney, Lee reiterated the government's "no
haste, be patient" and "tread gingerly to attain long-lasting
stability" policies toward mainland China.</P>
      <P>He said the policies have been devised in the hope that Taiwan
businesses which are poised to make inroads into mainland China will
further assess business and risk prospects before acting.</P>
      <P>Lee pointed out that the "no haste, be patient" policy is aimed
at slowing down Taiwan businessmen who are planning to embark on
investment projects worth over NT$50 million on the mainland, while
the "tread gingerly to attain long-lasting stability" strategy he
described as having an ultimate goal of seeing Taiwan businesses
enjoy sustainable operations and development, both at home and in
mainland China.</P>
      <P>He called for an immediate resumption of high-level dialogue
between Taiwan and mainland China, saying that Taiwan would
demonstrate great patience and sincerity during the dialogue process
in a bid to seek solutions to problems arising from increased
exchanges across the Taiwan Strait, including investment problems
that Taiwan businessmen commonly encounter on the mainland.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, he stressed his wish that by engaging in closer
exchanges with the mainland, Taiwan will help accelerate structural
changes there, consequently improving the investment climate and
environment for Taiwan businesses.</P>
      <P>Lee, a talented golfer who is close to professional standard, did
not have an opportunity to play in Tuesday's tournament because he
had been tied up with the activities in the National Assembly earlier
in the day.</P>
      <P>However, he told the competitors that he will definitely compete

    <HEADLINE>MAINLAND CHINA HAS `NO UNDERSTANDING' OF TAIWAN: SEF CHIEF</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   June   22   (CNA)
(By Wendy Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China has absolutely no
understanding of Taiwan, and the Republic of China resents Beijing's
oppression of Taiwan's international space, the chief of the Straits
Exchange Foundation (SEF) said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Koo Chen-fu, chairman of the quasi-official SEF, made the remarks
in an interview during a golf tournament he hosted on Tuesday
afternoon in response to ROC President Lee Teng-hui's State of the
Nation address which he delivered on Monday.</P>
      <P>Lee emphasized that Taiwan should acknowledge that two separate
administrations exist on the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, and that
both sides should have their own international space.</P>
      <P>Koo pointed out that mainland China announced in January that it
will "do its job" for the Taiwan people, but on the other hand the
mainland boycotts Taiwan incessantly in the international community,
and does everything in its power to subvert the ROC government.</P>
      <P>In addition, mainland China maintains its view that "unification
would be better than the present situation," Koo said, adding that
this reveals that the mainland does not understand Taiwan at all, as
the people of Taiwan will never believe that unification under
Beijing's terms would be better.</P>
      <P>In Lee's report, he said that the ROC will not challenge mainland
China, and will jointly take part in international organizations and
activities and enlarge its international space.</P>
      <P>Koo agreed with Lee, and said that while it is difficult to
fathom the mainland, the ROC government wishes that Association for
Relations Across the Strait (ARATS) Chairman Wang Daohan's autumn
visit will enable him to understand Taiwan a little better.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has already positioned Wang's visit as "a journey to
understand Taiwan," and Lee has also offered on numerous occasions
that he would be glad to personally lead Wang on a tour of the
island.</P>
      <P>In response to SEF Deputy Secretary-General Jan Jyh-horng's
forthcoming visit to Beijing to conduct talks with his mainland
counterpart, Koo said that cross-strait administrative issues are
very important. Not only are they related to the people's rights, he
said, they are also a starting point for both sides to "accumulate
mutual trust."</P>
      <P>He said that since mainland China calls itself the "People's"
Republic of China, it should respect its people's rights even more.</P>
      <P>He also pointed out that if the mainland authorities cannot even
abide by the four agreements signed during the 1993 Koo-Wang talks in
Singapore, it is doubtful that both sides can build trust.</P>
      <P>Koo urged both sides to resume an institutional negotiation
mechanism, and to handle practical issues such as the repatriation of
mainland hijackers and illegal immigrants and fishing disputes, which
are directly pertinent to the people's rights on both sides of the
strait.</P>
      <P>The "middle-range agreements" between both sides should be
accomplished one by one like building a pyramid, in order to
gradually build trust, Koo said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>COMPLAINANT DISAPPOINTED WITH VERDICT ON NORTHWEST AIRLINES  SUIT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 22 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taipei District Court on Tuesday ruled
that Northwest Airlines must pay NT$61,396 (US$1,895) to former
Taiwan passenger Wu Pei-min and his family as compensation for their
suffering from "a certain degree of disturbance" during a flight from
Taipei to San Francisco last year.</P>
      <P>Interest accumulated from the date of Wu's filing of the suit
will be included in the payment, the judgment ruled.</P>
      <P>The court, however, rejected Wu's demand for compensation of
NT$11.72 million (US$362,000) from the US-based airline on charges of
damage caused by second-hand smoke, maltreatment and discrimination.</P>
      <P>The judges said it is hard to define the damage caused by
second-hand smoke, particularly during a short period of time.</P>
      <P>Upon hearing the judgment, Wu expressed disappointment, and said
he will consider filing an appeal.</P>
      <P>Wu stressed that the goal of his suit against Northwest was not
for money, but rather to highlight the harm caused by smoking.</P>
      <P>On a flight from Taiwan to San Francisco via Tokyo on April 2,
1998, Wu, his wife and three daughters were seated in non-smoking
seats in business class. As the seats directly behind them were
smoking seats, Wu asked the flight attendants if he could move his
daughters to empty seats in the front of the non-smoking section, as
one daughter suffers from asthma and another has a weak respiratory
system.</P>
      <P>After denying Wu's request, a flight attendant taped off the
empty seats to discourage him from moving his daughters there on his
own, he stated.</P>
      <P>Wu said that because of the smoke during the 10-hour flight, his
youngest daughter suffered from incessant coughing, diarrhea and
vomiting, and was diagnosed with bronchitis, which is linked to
second-hand smoke, upon landing in San Francisco. The family was then
forced to cancel their vacation.</P>
      <P>Wu said he tried to negotiate with Northwest authorities but
after failing to receive a response, contacted the John Tung
Foundation, a local anti-smoking crusader group, and filed a lawsuit
on July 28 last year.</P>
      <P>Upon learning of the ruling on Tuesday, Northwest Airlines'
Taipei office expressed regret over the result, without making any
further comment.</P>
      <P>It was learned that following the Wu incident, Northwest banned
smoking altogether on all of its flights beginning on Aug. 1, 1998.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China President Lee Teng-hui
said on Tuesday that it is better to press ahead with democracy and
address the difficulties along the way than to balk at pursuing
democracy for fear of the problems it might entail.</P>
      <P>At a luncheon for National Assembly delegates, Lee addressed
public concerns that the local legislature is awash with gangsters,
saying that closing loopholes in the electoral system is not enough
to block the mobsters from infiltrating politics. Instead, Lee
advocated education as a cure for the problem.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan has followed its democratic path for only
about ten years, Lee said it natural that problems will crop up along
the way.</P>
      <P>Responding to some National Assembly delegates' complaints about
Taiwan's worsening social order, Lee blamed Taiwan's flawed education
system which, he said, puts too much emphasis on academic
achievements and discriminates against those who perform less well in
examinations.</P>
      <P>The unhealthy education system has forced many students who
cannot adapt to it out of the nation's schools, and has set them
against society, said Lee.</P>
      <P>The president urged an overhaul of the education system to allow
schools to embrace students with lower academic achievements, and to
give them their due.</P>
      <P>In response to questions from delegates during the luncheon, Lee
displayed flexibility toward the opposition Democratic Progressive
Party's demands for constitutional reforms, and urged the DPP to keep
on negotiating with the ruling Kuomintang.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The two Taiwan-based airlines operating
between Manila and Taipei denied on Tuesday that they have violated
an aviation pact between the two countries by extending its
Taipei-bound flights to the United States.</P>
      <P>Both China Airlines and EVA Airways, which provide flight
services between Taiwan and the Philippines, said all US-bound
passengers from Manila are deplaned in Taipei and transferred to
different planes with different flight numbers, as required by the
aviation pact, before continuing on to their final destinations.</P>
      <P>Arguing that they operate the Taipei-Manila route with
medium-sized Boeing 737s, but routinely use Boeing 747 jumbo jets on
the Taiwan-US route, the two carriers said it is impossible for those
passengers originating from Manila to fly aboard the same plane to
the United States via Taipei as the Manila authorities have charged.</P>
      <P>The Manila civil aviation administration threatened on Tuesday to
impose sanctions on the two carriers if they do not answer the
charges within five days.</P>
      <P>The aviation administration claimed that EVA took 181 US-bound
passengers from Manila in May, and that China Airlines carried 29
passengers in the first week of June.</P>
      <P>Chang Kuo-cheng, director-general of Taipei's Civil Aeronautics
Administration weighed in on Tuesday to support the two airlines, and
blamed their Philippine rival, Philippine Airlines, for making false
complaints to the Philippine government because of its poor business
in the face of the Taiwan carriers' competition.</P>
      <P>Chang said the dispute will be discussed in July when the
bilateral aviation pact is up for renewal.</P>

      <P>Republic of China President Lee Teng-hui on
Tuesday expressed concern over the worsening problem of juvenile
delinquency on Taiwan, and said he has asked related authorities to
take effective steps to deal with the issue.</P>
      <P>Addressing the National Assembly, Lee said that juvenile

    <HEADLINE>LEGISLATORS EYEING MILITARY COMPOUND FOR NEW HOME</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  23  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislators on Tuesday night passed a
resolution to relocate their headquarters to a military compound
located in downtown Taipei, sources from the Legislative Yuan said on
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>After examining eight possible relocation sites, the legislators
selected the Air Force General Headquarters on high-priced Jenai
Road. The site received 54 votes, more than half the number of votes
cast during the legislature's Tuesday night session.</P>
      <P>The legislature's selection does not mean the facilities will
automatically become available to them, however, as air force
authorities have expressed opposition to giving up the compound right
now.</P>
      <P>The air force will not be able to relocate its headquarters until
its own relocation plans are settled, air force authorities said. It
has been proposed that the air force relocate to a tri-military
compound located in Tahchih by the Keelung River.</P>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan has talked about relocating its headquarters
for years, as the current building is old and too small to
accommodate the increased numbers of legislators and their aides.</P>
      <P>Recently, the Legislative Yuan selected eight possible relocation
sites.</P>
      <P>The seven other options -- the Huashan Railway Station, the
Sungshan Tobacco Plant, Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall, the Grand
Hotel, the Taiwan Railway Bureau, the Chung Hsing New Village and an
overhaul of the existing Yuan tract -- all received less than 10
votes.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the opposition New Party still opposes the relocation,
saying it is immoral for the legislature to spend taxpayers' money
for the benefit of lawmakers themselves.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Relations between the Republic of
China and Malawi will be further strengthened based on the current
basis, said Control Yuan President Frederick Chien on Tuesday
here.
 Chien, head of a seven-member ROC delegation, arrived in Malawi
over the weekend to take part in the Monday inauguration of
President-elect Bakili Muluzi in Blantyre, a major commercial city in
southern Malawi.</P>
      <P>Muluzi, beating four other rivals, scored a victory in his
re-election bid in the country's June 15 presidential race.</P>
      <P>Chien said the ROC delegation has been received by the Malawian
government with the highest honor, and expressed the belief that
two-way ROC-Malawi ties will be further stepped up.</P>
      <P>In Monday's presidential inauguration of Muluzi, Chien, alone
with heads of state from Zambia, Botswana, Mozambique and Tanzania,
as well as with the prime minister of Namibia and Malawi's first and
second presidents, sat in the first row of the audience.</P>
      <P>In Muluzi's inaugural speech, the ROC was the third country,
after Britain and the United States, to be named as one that has
extended significant assistance to Malawi. Other countries included
Germany, Norway, Holland and Japan.</P>
      <P>During a state banquet held in Monday evening, Chien and his
wife also sat together with Muluzi and his wife at the same table,
an indication that the ROC envoy was warmly received by the Malawian
newly elected president.</P>
      <P>In a Sunday gathering with the ROC delegation, Muluzi voiced
appreciation for President Lee Teng-hui's reception last time when he
visited Taiwan in 1996, and offered an invitation to Lee, welcoming
him to visit Malawi.</P>
      <P>While in Malawi, the ROC mission also met with ROC nationals and
technical assistance personnel residing here. The delegation is
scheduled to leave here for Taiwan on Tuesday afternoon.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN PATENT APPLICATIONS INCREASING IN MAINLAND CHINA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  23  (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>More and more Taiwan applications for
patent rights are being filed in mainland China, which benefits
cross-strait trade, a mainland official involved in intellectual
property rights protection said Wednesday in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Wu Buoming, deputy director of the Intellectual Property Rights
Bureau, made the remarks at a conference in which representatives
from Taiwan and the mainland exchanged views on patent theory and
practices.</P>
      <P>Wu said 73 percent of Taiwanese patent applications in the
mainland were filed for innovative products that are practical for
daily life, such as household appliances, furniture and sporting
equipment. Meanwhile, 17 percent of patent applications are related
to designs, and 10 percent are related to inventions.</P>
      <P>Most invention-related patent applications filed by Taiwanese are
concerned with electronics, including telecommunications equipment
and computers, Wu said.</P>
      <P>The two-day cross-strait conference opened Wednesday in Taipei,
and more than 30 mainland Chinese officials and experts in the area

    <HEADLINE>JOBLESS RATE IN MAY HIGHEST FOR THAT MONTH SINCE 1978</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  23 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's unemployment rate surged to 2.84
percent in May, the highest jobless level for that month since 1978,
the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS)
reported on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>DGBAS officials put the blame for the high jobless rate in May on
an increased number of job seekers and fewer openings.</P>
      <P>The officials warned that if the unemployment is not arrested
effectively in following months, the jobless rate for this year may
break the alarming and intolerable 3-percent mark.</P>
      <P>Taiwan posted a cumulative 2.78-percent unemployment rate for the
first five months of this year, a relatively high level compared with
the same period last year. Joblessness is typically low in April and
May, when seasonal factors are at a minimum, DGBAS officials noted.
But this has not been the case this year, they said.</P>
      <P>They said the 1999 jobless rate is very likely to exceed 3
percent, as the unemployment rate is expected to average over 3
percent in the "peak months" of June, July and August.</P>
      <P>According to DGBAS tallies, the number of jobless people in
Taiwan increased by 10,000 from April to 273,000 in May. That number
is the largest ever for the month of May and the largest as a
percentage of the total workforce since 1978.</P>
      <P>The statistics showed that Taiwan's workforce totaled 9.35
million people at the end of May, up 72,000 over the year-earlier
level, and 45,000 people more than were recorded in April.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan's economy picked up steam in May, the number of
job openings in the business and industrial sectors did not rise
correspondingly to meet employment demands, the officials pointed
out.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's jobless rate in May was still lower than those of other
major economies in Asia, they said. South Korea's unemployment rate
was 6.5 percent in May, compared with 6.3 percent in Hong Kong, 4.8
percent in Japan and 3.9 percent in Singapore.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The United Nations, angered by
pro-integration militia violence and intimidation in East Timor, is
preparing to postpone the scheduled Aug. 8 referendum on the fate of
the territory, Australian media reported on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan has indicated that the referendum
could be postponed by at least two weeks so that the territory's
400,000 East Timorese will be able to choose independence or autonomy
within the Indonesian republic freely and without harassment.</P>
      <P>He also indicated that security problems and the unlawful
participation of local government officials in pro-autonomy political
campaigning remain, despite Indonesian claims that violence and
political tension have significantly subsided.</P>
      <P>The UN mission in East Timor is understood to have recommended a
postponement that could push the vote back to Aug. 29.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AUSSIE-CHINESE SCIENTIST LEADING EFFORTS TO DEVELOP BETTER TV SCREENS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  June  23 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A young Australian scientist of Chinese
origin has taken the lead in advancing nanotube technology, paving
the way for a completely new type of television and flat-panel
computer display, according to the Commonwealth Scientific and
Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO) on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>In a statement faxed to CNA, the CSIRO said Liming Dai -- aided
by Shaoming Huang, a contracted scientist from Nanking University --
has improved the technology, discovered by a Japanese scientist in
1991. Both Dai and Huang are working for the CSIRO in Melbourne as
researchers.</P>
      <P>In screens, carbon nanotubes work as an intermediary, focusing
electrons onto a surface where they react with a fluorescent material
to produce light for picture displays.</P>
      <P>"It has been a major challenge for researchers to get control of
the way they form. In order to use nanotubes for panel displays it is
important that the tubes are either aligned or formed into patterns,"
Dai said in the same statement. Dai went to Australia in 1986 to
study and obtained a Ph.D. from Australian National University in
Canberra.</P>
      <P>"We have been able to take a lead in this research, as we found
ways to control the arrangement of the nanotubes," he added.</P>
      <P>Flat-screen technology is expected to result in a multi-billion
dollar market worldwide over the next few years, the statement said.</P>
      <P>"CSIRO's carbon nanotube work is world class, and could well lead
to exciting developments in flat screen technology," said Ernst
Hammel of the top scientific body in Australia. "This technology is
the subject of intensive R&amp;D, especially in the USA, but we believe
the Australian research is at the very forefront," he added.</P>
      <P>Commercial production is expected to take place in a few years.</P>

Confucius' lesson of the day: "A man who withdraws himself from
the world for no other reason than to show his personal purity of
motive, is one who breaks up one of the greatest ties in the
foundation of society. A good and wise man, on the other hand, who
enters the public service, tries to carry out what he thinks to be
right. As to the failure of right principles to make progress, he is
well aware of that."</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>SOLOMON ISLANDS TURMOIL WILL NOT AFFECT TIES WITH ROC: MOFA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 23 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The current turmoil in the Solomon Islands
will not affect the South Pacific island nation's relations with the
Republic of China, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said on
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Acting MOFA spokesman Chen Ming-cheng made the remarks in
response to foreign wire service reports that the unrest in the South
Pacific island nation is related to a power struggle between its
pro-Taiwan and pro-mainland China factions.</P>
      <P>Chen dismissed the reports as sheer speculation, and stressed
that the conflict is a result of ethnic tension.</P>
      <P>"The turmoil should not be used as an excuse to influence
ROC-Solomon Islands relations," Chen said, adding that the government
of the Solomon Islands has reaffirmed its friendship with and firm
support for the ROC.</P>
      <P>Chen went on to say that the ROC Embassy in the Solomon Islands
has been closely monitoring related developments there, and has
reinforced its security measures.</P>
      <P>"To date, all ROC expatriates, embassy staff, members of our
agricultural mission and their families are safe," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Tensions have been growing in the Solomon Islands since last
September when an informal group known as the Guadalcanal Liberation
Army began pressing for the removal of Malaita islanders from the
main island of the Solomon group, and compensation for their presence
there since the country gained independence.</P>
      <P>The nation is now under a state of emergency following a series
of guerrilla attacks on oil palm plantations in Mbalisuna, a township
east of the capital, Honiara.</P>
      <P>According to foreign wire service reports, former Fiji Prime

    <HEADLINE>JUNE EXPORTS ESTIMATED TO SOAR 2.5 PERCENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  23  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's exports in June are expected to
soar 2.5 percent to 3 percent over the year-earlier level, while
imports are estimated to remain at the same level, the Ministry of
Finance (MOF) reported on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>MOF officials estimated that June exports will top between US$9.3
billion and US$9.4 billion, while imports will amount to US$8.6
billion.</P>
      <P>The MOF statistics show that Taiwan's exports totaled US$5.86
billion in the first half of June, up 2.3 percent over the
year-earlier level, while imports amounted to US$5.49 billion, down
0.1 percent.</P>
      <P>As a result, Taiwan was left with a surplus of US$1.33 billion in
the two-week period, a whopping increase of 56 percent over the
corresponding period of last year.</P>
      <P>Cumulatively, Taiwan posted a surplus of US$4.85 billion in
foreign trade in the period between Jan. 1 and June 15 this year, a
figure about five times that posted in the same period of 1998,
according to the MOF tallies.</P>
      <P>Hsu Kuo-chung, director of the MOF's Statistics Department,
attributed the soar in exports in June to brisk trade in electronics,
telecommunications and information technology products as the result
of a worldwide economic recovery, particularly in Asia.</P>
      <P>Hsu said Taiwan's military hardware imports declined sharply in
the first half of June, but imports of capital equipment and
industrial as well as agricultural raw materials increased, resulting
in an import level about the same as the year-earlier level.</P>
      <P>He forecast that both the export and import trade will further
gather steam in the third quarter, on the grounds that the economies
in the Asia-Pacific region have become brisker, which means their
imports from Taiwan will increase; Taiwan's first high-speed railway
project is kicking off soon; the Y2K effect; and the ever-increasing
expansion of the cellular phone industry in the country.</P>
      <P>In addition, Hsu noted, the recent worldwide dioxin scare
triggered by Belgian dairy and meat exports has not adversely
affected Taiwan's economy, as local imports of Belgian food products
are minuscule in proportion to the island's overall foreign trade.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou will meet the
press on Friday and will lead his working team in a review of their
work as the city's administration six months after Ma's inauguration.</P>
      <P>The mayor is said to be attaching great importance to the
upcoming press conference, with a rehearsal scheduled for Thursday,
and even a strict dress code for city government officials attending
-- dark suits for the men, pink for the ladies.</P>
      <P>During an administrative meeting a month ago, Ma requested
officials at each administrative level to list their five most
successful accomplishments and their five least successful
accomplishments of the past half-year, and these findings were
compiled into a report which Ma will use as a base to explain to
Taipei's citizens what his team has done for the people.</P>
      <P>In view of the fact that Ma's working team got a lower rating in
polls regarding their performance as compared with its predecessor --
the team headed by former Taipei Mayor Chen Shui-bian -- Ma expressed
his hope that he can show the citizens of Taipei his team's
achievements.</P>
      <P>Some of Ma's team have been criticized as "bureaucratic" and

      <P>Between July 27 and July 31, women's teams from Japan, Canada,
Australia, New Zealand and the host Taiwan will compete against each
other, while men's teams from Costa Rica, Iran, the Philippines,
South Korea, New Zealand, South Africa and Taiwan will meet in a

    <HEADLINE>CONTROVERSIAL TAX BUSINESS AMENDMENT PASSES THROUGH LEGISLATURE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 22 (CNA)
(By Amanda Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan acted true to form on
the last day of the current legislative session late on Tuesday
evening, scurrying to pass as many bills as possible.</P>
      <P>The most controversial among 21 bills passed in the session which
did not end until 9:40 p.m. was an amendment to cut business tax on
financial and insurance institutions to 2 percent from the current 5
percent, a move which brought fierce protests from some legislators.</P>
      <P>The bill, which was adopted by a vote of 93 to 84, did not pass
until the third and final reading, as the first two readings were
invalidated due to the lack of a quorum.</P>
      <P>The tax cut, which will go into effect on July 1, will reduce
annual government revenue by NT$41.3 billion. However, the savings
stemming from the tax cut will be used to offset up to NT$300
billion-worth of bad loans in banking institutions in four years,
therefore lowering the ratio of overdue loans to below 2.5 percent,
said officials from the Ministry of Finance (MOF).</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, legislators from both the ruling Kuomintang and the
opposition New Party blasted the MOF, saying it has failed to come up
with replacement measures to make up for the revenue losses.</P>
      <P>The fairness of the bill also invited arguments, legislators
said, saying it will mostly benefit some poorly performing banks with
higher-than-average bad debt ratios, leaving the public to suffer
the consequences.</P>
      <P>Under the amendment, banks, insurance companies, trust investment
companies, securities and futures brokers and pawnbrokers will now be
subject to 2 percent business tax.</P>
      <P>The amendment also rules that banks and insurance companies
should allocate 3 percent of their profits to offset overdue loans or
fund a bad debt reserve within four years of the bill's
implementation.</P>
      <P>If these targets are not reached, an additional 1 percent will be
added to the business tax.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, it was reported that the MOF is working with the banks
to establish a schedule as well as measures to offset bad loans, and
that the legislature has requested the MOF to report to and obtain
permission from the legislature before implementing such measures.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Kaohsiung City Mayor Frank Hsieh, who
will have been in office for six months on Friday, on Wednesday
emphasized the importance of "continuously surpassing his ideals."</P>
      <P>Hsieh made the remarks during a press conference held at city
hall, where a multi-functional trade park blueprint is on exhibition.</P>
      <P>The rezoning application for the park was approved by the
Ministry of the Interior's (MOI) city planning committee in early
June, which has given a boost to the city administration, Hsieh said
while describing the positive prospects for the park.</P>
      <P>Hsieh also reported on the Kaohsiung city government's
administrative achievements over the past six months, including the
promotion of the trade park, inclusion of the Pratas Islands into the
city domain, and the controversial issuance of a charity lottery.</P>
      <P>In addition, he said, the city government will continue
construction of mass rapid transit systems, begin enrollment of the
Kaohsiung University next year, strive for the establishment of a new
southern international airport, readjust administrative districts,
and begin construction of a "giant egg" domed stadium.</P>
      <P>Hsieh, who said he won the mayoral election "by a miracle," said
he has now adjusted to his office. He also stressed that the
achievements were realized through the concerted efforts of all
members of the present and past city governments and mayors.</P>
      <P>He added that he has simply continued with "the basis established
by his predecessors" and has done his best to "move the city along."</P>
      <P>In response to questions on his opinion of his administrative
efforts, Hsieh replied that he has continuously strived to be "better
and better," is not satisfied with his present achievements, and will
leave the grading of his administration to the citizens.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung City might not be "no. 1," Hsieh said, but it must be
the "only one." He pledged to exert his utmost efforts to guide the

    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Foreign Minister Jason Hu
on Wednesday denied allegations that his forthcoming visit to the
United States is aimed at paving the way for a later visit by Vice
President Lien Chan to his alma mater, the University of Chicago.</P>
      <P>Hu is slated to leave for the United States on Friday for a
five-day visit to Chicago and San Francisco, where he will speak at
the North America Taiwan General Chamber of Commerce (NATGCC) annual
meeting and the World Affairs Council in Northern California.</P>
      <P>In response to questions from the press, Hu said that both are
long-standing engagements, and added that the NATGCC chairman even
came to Taiwan to personally extend the invitation, which made him
decide on the visit.</P>
      <P>Hu said he also plans to meet with American Institute in Taiwan
Chairman Richard Bush during his visit, but denied media reports that
they are scheduled to discuss specific issues.</P>
      <P>On the subject of Nauru, one of Taiwan's 28 diplomatic allies,
deferring on Tuesday its application to join the United Nations (UN)
because of opposition from mainland China, Hu said the ROC is paying
close attention to the issue, and called the mainland's actions a
display of "naked hegemony."</P>
      <P>Hu said that mainland China's continued objection to Nauru's
admission into the UN is unacceptable to the ROC, and that naturally
the ROC government will be closely monitoring the situation.</P>
      <P>The UN Security Council committee on the admission of new members
reviewed the application of Kiribati and Nauru on Tuesday. While
Kiribati's request was quickly endorsed, Nauru's application was
deferred due to mainland China's opposition on the grounds that the
tiny Pacific island nation acknowledges the ROC's sovereignty.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN RULES OUT IMPORTS OF MAINLAND CHINA-MADE FMD VACCINE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  23  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Board of Foreign Trade (BOFT) of the
Republic of China on Wednesday rejected a proposal to import mainland
China-produced foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) vaccine.</P>
      <P>BOFT Deputy Director-General Wei Ke-ming said the board would not
hastily open Taiwan's doors to mainland Chinese FMD vaccine because
few data are available concerning its safety and efficacy.</P>
      <P>Wei made the announcement after presiding over a meeting of
officials from relevant government agencies to discuss whether an
import ban on mainland China-produced FMD vaccine should be lifted.</P>
      <P>Mainland China indicated earlier this month that it is willing to
provide Taiwan with FMD vaccine to help contain the spread of the
contagious disease which affects cloven-hoofed animals such as pigs,
sheep, cattle and goats.</P>
      <P>Beijing's offer came after several cattle raised in the Republic
of China-held frontline island of Kinmen and the southern Taiwan
county of Tainan were found to have been infected with the FMD virus.</P>
      <P>Laboratory tests show that the FMD virus that infected the Kinmen
and Tainan cattle is similar to a strain found in mainland China's
southeastern coastal areas. Local animal disease control officials
suspect that the virus in Kinmen and Tainan might have been
transmitted through smuggled animals from mainland China.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture (COA) said mainland
China has long been recognized as an FMD-infected area, and serious
FMD outbreaks have been reported in several mainland provinces in
recent months. Beijing, however, has never reported details of its
FMD infections to the Paris-based international organization
dedicated to the control of contagious animal diseases.</P>
      <P>Noting that three types of the virus have been discovered in
mainland China -- "type O," "Asia-1," and "type A, COA officials
said mainland China should send its FMD vaccine to a global FMD virus
testing laboratory in Britain to certify its safety and efficacy.</P>
      <P>Lee Chin-lung, director of the COA's Plants and Animals
Quarantine Bureau, said the ROC government would consider lifting the
import ban only after mainland China's animal disease control
measures and its vaccine production process have become more
transparent.</P>
      <P>About 10 countries around the world, including Germany, France
and Argentina, produce FMD vaccine. Although Taiwan has the
technology to produce the vaccine, it still relies on imports,
choosing not to produce its own out of concern over risk and cost
effectiveness.</P>
      <P>Lee said Taiwan still has 2 million doses of vaccine against
various types of FMD virus, and warned: "Local dairy farmers should
not use smuggled mainland Chinese-made FMD vaccine, because this
increases the risk of spreading unknown viruses from the mainland."</P>
      <P>All the 500-plus cattle raised in the FMD-infected ranches in
Kinmen and Tainan have been slaughtered over the past week to
prevent further spread of the virus.</P>
      <P>FMD is an acute, contagious disease that can be spread via air
and infects mainly cloven-hoofed livestock and wild animals. Its
mortality rate is 5 percent, but can rise to 50 percent in young
animals.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's hog farms were hit by an FMD outbreak in 1997,
resulting in the death of 3.85 million pigs and an
estimated financial loss of NT$160 billion.</P>

      <P>Legislators received low credit ratings for
their performances during the first session of the Fourth Legislative
Yuan, according to the results of an opinion survey released on
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The survey of local reporters covering the legislative beat was
conducted by the office of ruling Kuomintang Legislator Chen Hung-chi
from June 8-17. The office sent out 104 questionnaires and received
79 valid replies.</P>
      <P>The survey results show that local journalists gave a low score
of just 51.42 points on a 100-point scale to lawmakers' performances
in the legislative session which ended on Tuesday evening.</P>
      <P>According to the poll, 47 percent of the respondents evaluated
lawmakers' general performances as "average," while 32 percent said
they feel the lawmakers' performances were "bad."</P>
      <P>An overwhelming 89 percent of the reporters said they found that
the legislators performed either "badly" or "very badly" in the
category of "disregarding personal interests while mulling
legislative bills."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 83 percent said they feel that the legislators have
failed to fulfill their duties of screening the government's budget
plan and supervising its use of the budget.</P>
      <P>Seventy-two percent said they think that the overall quality and
performances of the incumbent legislators are worse than those of
their predecessors.</P>
      <P>Legislator Shen Fu-hsiung of the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party said he would "humbly accept" the reporters'
criticism of the legislature, but noted that members of the current

several subgroups and factions have dominated legislative process and

    <DATELINE>Bangkok,  June  23  (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A senior Mainland Affairs Council (MAC)
official said Beijing's "big-country" diplomatic strategy will not
succeed in preventing the Republic of China (ROC) from the
participating in the international community because most countries
support democracy and freedom.</P>
      <P>Wu An-chia, vice chairman of the Cabinet-level MAC, made the
remarks on Tuesday in a speech to more than 30 representatives of
Chinese-language newspapers and Taiwan university alumni association
leaders currently living in Thailand.</P>
      <P>Wu said Beijing's efforts to isolate Taiwan have failed in the
wake of Macedonia's decision to establish diplomatic relations
with the ROC.</P>
      <P>Although at present only 28 countries maintain diplomatic links
with Taiwan, the ROC has substantial trade and economic relations
with more than 100 countries, Wu said.</P>
      <P>The 56-year-old executive of Taiwan's mainland policy warned that
a conflict between the ROC and mainland China would result in a great
loss of life and would likely become a testing ground for each
country's modern weapons.</P>
      <P>Wise leaders on both sides of the Taiwan Strait, Wu said, should
take steps to avoid the gloomy scenario by stopping the purchase of
increasingly powerful modern weapons.</P>
      <P>Wu, who paid eight visits to the mainland before asssuming his
MAC post, said that it would be impossible for Taipei to stop
purchasiong modern weapons before Beijing abandons its military
threat against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Some academicians and cross-strait affairs experts in Taiwan
support the idea that Taipei should change its "defensive" national
defense policy into a "deterrent" one in order to safeguard the lives
of 20 million Taiwan people, he said.</P>
      <P>Citing the confrontation between South and North Korea, Wu said
that he beleived even if a summit meeting between the leaders of
Taiwan and mainland China would not necessarily be able to stop the
cross-strait arms race immediately.</P>
      <P>The best way to resolve cross-strait disputes, according to MAC's
strategy, is to launch a series of peaceful negotiations and
exchanges over a variety of issues, with the aim of promoting mutual
understanding.</P>

TAIWAN BOURSE ON BULLISH LONG-TERM TREND</P>
      <P>Taipei, June 23 (CNA) While the recent rally of the Taiwan Stock
Exchange will lead to profit-taking by investors and despite the
local bourse's need to make a downward correction, the local stock
market is still on a bullish long-term trend, a securities industry
expert said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Ku Yueh-han, general manager of Merrill Lynch Investment
Consultative Corp. (Taiwan), made the remark during the second day of
the second Asia-Pacific Technology Conference held at the Far Eastern
Plaza Hotel.</P>
      <P>While electronics stocks dominated the local bourse in 1997,
banking and electronics stocks, especially those semiconductor stocks
that are rumored to be corporate merger targets, can be the
investment targets for local investors during the next three years,
Ku suggested.</P>
      <P>Because the world economy has started to recover, stocks that are
related to the rise and fall of economic cycles can also be
investment targets, Ku added.</P>
      <P>Joe Osha, a semiconductor industry analyst with Merrill Lynch
Securities, indicated the semiconductor industry, from the American
point of view, can maintain its prosperity for at least two more
years. He added that Taiwan's wafer foundry industry is expected to
perform well during this period due to the industry's competitiveness
in the world market.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TWO ROC AIRLINES WARNED BY PHILIPPINE AVIATION BOARD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Manila   June  23  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Following a crackdown by the Civil
Aeronautics Board (CAB) on foreign airlines that violated a bilateral
air agreement with the Philippines, the Air Transpiration Office
(ATO) Wednesday said most of the 26 airlines that operate in the
country violate the agreement.</P>
      <P>"Most of them are eating up the market of Philippine Airlines,
the country's flag carrier. Most of them have violated the
agreement" ATO chief Capt. Jacinto Ortega said.</P>
      <P>According to Ortega, apart from the two airlines registered in
the Republic of China (ROC), Eva Air and China Airlines, the CAB is
also monitoring the passenger loading done by Korean Airlines and
Asiana Airlines, South Korea's national air carriers, as well as
airlines from Hong Kong to see if they are violating the bilateral
air agreement.</P>
      <P>Ortega, the vice-chairman of the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB)
said the board will not allow the violations by foreign airlines to
go on.</P>
      <P>"They are eating up our flag carrier's market, nobody can help
us except us Filipinos," Ortega said.</P>
      <P>Earlier, the CAB sent a "show cause order" (warning) to both Eva
Air and China Airlines explaining that they have violated the "Six
Freedom Rights".</P>
      <P>The Six Freedom Rights is an agreement between two countries
authorizing the two countries' airlines to fly into the other.</P>
      <P>According to Ortega, the CAB will see to it that all air
agreements signed with other countries are followed to the letter.</P>
      <P>"We have an air agreement with these countries, they have to
abide by these agreements, in the same token that our country's flag
carrier is abiding by the agreement", Ortega added.

    <HEADLINE>MORE US LAWMAKERS WELCOME TAIWAN'S PLAN TO AID KOSOVO</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  June 23 (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Another two members of the US Congress
have commended the Republic of China's (ROC) US$300 million aid
package to help Kosovar refugees, saying Taiwan is most praiseworthy
in its willingness to assist other nations.</P>
      <P>Rep. Donald M. Payne (D-NJ) spoke on the House floor Tuesday that
the US Department of State announced on June 7 that it welcomed
Taiwan's plan to offer $300 million to help Kosovar refugees and for
reconstruction of Kosovo.</P>
      <P>As a major economic power in the Far East, the congressman noted,
Taiwan feels that it must not shirk its responsibilities to help
other countries in need and "hopes to set a good example for other
wealthy nations in the world to extend a helping hand to all those
displaced Kosovar refugees."</P>
      <P>As a matter of fact, even though Taiwan is not a member of the
United Nations, Taiwan has always committed itself to help other
countries in the Far East and Africa. "Taiwan's willingness to be a
donor nation deeply reflects its people's firm commitment to protect
and promote human rights and their humanitarian concern for the
Kosovar refugees living in exile as well as for the war-torn areas in
dire need of reconstruction," added Rep. Payne.</P>
      <P>Rep. Shelley Berkley (D-NV) also applauded last Friday the ROC as
"a member of the world community for its continued commitment to
protecting and promoting human rights." And she submitted the text of
President Lee Teng-hui's June 7 statement on the aid package to be
printed in the US Congressional Record.</P>
      <P>President Lee's announcement of the contribution was "both
timely and insightful, fully demonstrating the ROC's concern for
peace in the world," said the congresswoman.</P>
      <P>Twelve other members of both houses of the US Congress
have spoken highly of Taiwan's generous offer to help the Kosovar
refugees over the past two weeks.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Three of the four Filipino sailors who
accused Taiwanese officers of throwing three Romanian stowaways
overboard in 1996 have been reunited with their families in Halifax,
the Canadian Press (CP) reported Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The CP quoted Rev. Flemming Holm, who speaks for a group formed
to defend the Maersk Dubai seamen, as saying the family of the fourth
is expected to arrive within weeks.</P>
      <P>All four sailors were granted landed immigrant status after a
long fight to stay in Canada. They claimed their lives were at risk
back home because they had told authorities that three stowaways had
been forced from the Maersk Dubai at sea.</P>
      <P>Holm said the first three families actually came to Canada in
February but it wasn't made public for fear of too much publicity.</P>
      <P>The children are attending schools in the Halifax area and all
four men are employed, according to the report.</P>
      <P>The captain of the Maersk Dubai has been indicted for negligence
by a Taiwanese court but it's unclear when he will go on trial, the

    <TEXT>
      <P>An American congressman speaking on the
floor of the House of Representative Wednesday applauded the
contributions that the Taiwanese-Americans have made to the United
States.</P>
      <P>Bob Schaffer (R-Co.) in Wednesday's House speech, which has been
included in the Congressional Record, also affirmed Taiwan's
democratic development and its efforts to protect human rights over
the past 10-odd years.</P>
      <P>Schaffer said the 500,000 Taiwanese-Americans have made countless
and influential contributions to the United States, and their
achievements can be easily seen in all areas of American life. The
group includes artists, Nobel Prize winners, human rights campaigners
and business leaders.</P>
      <P>He said the Taiwan American Heritage Week also provides a good
opportunity for Americans to recognize Taiwan's democratic
development. Since 1987, he said, Republic of China residents have
been able to select their own president and enjoy freedom of religion
and speech.</P>
      <P>Most important, Schaffer noted, the Taiwan American Heritage Week
underlines the long-lasting friendship between Taiwan and the United
States.</P>
      <P>May has been dedicated in the United States as American
Asia-Pacific Tradition Month, during which various activities
introducing Asian-Pacific cultures were staged.</P>
      <P>Beginning this year, one week in May was dedicated as the Taiwan
American Heritage Week to exclusively introduce Taiwan to America.</P>
      <P>President Bill Clinton sent a congratulatory message to the
opening of the Taiwan American Heritage Week, and David Wu (D-Org.)
and other congressmen recognized the weeks' special meaning for
immigrants from Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AUSTRALIAN COURT DISQUALIFIES ONE NATION'S SENATOR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  June  24  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Australian High Court has for the
first time declared Britain a foreign country and thus disqualified
One Nation party's only candidate elected to the Senate in last
October.</P>
      <P>The court's landmark declaration automatically annulled the
qualification of Heather Hill, a senior One Nation official in
Queensland, to become the party's senator on July 1 because she
failed to renounce her British citizenship when she was nominated by
her party to take part in the October 3 election. She was the only
One Nation candidate to win a Senate seat.</P>
      <P>The decision came after a Chinese businessman in Sydney
challenged Hill's qualification to become a senator. Under Australian
law, a considerable number of Australians have dual citizenship, but
they must renounce the citizenship of their mother country once
they take part in elections.</P>
      <P>The High Court will reconvene in Brisbane on Thursday to consider
how a recount of the Queensland Senate votes should be carried out. It
is believed the recount would give another One Nation candidate --
Len Harris, Hill's Senate seat.</P>

Confucius' lesson of the day: "In the conduct of government there
are five good principles to be kept in mind and respected. First, to
benefit the people without wasting the resources of the country;
secondly, to encourage labor without giving cause for complaint;
thirdly, to desire for the enjoyments of life without being covetous;
fourthly, to be dignified without being supercilious; fifthly, to
inspire awe without being severe."</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>ROC DOESN'T LIKE TO SEE WORSENING OF BEIJING-WASHINGTON TIES: LIEN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 24 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China does not like to see
relations between mainland China and the United States worsen and
thus lead to regional tension and affect other countries in the
Asia-Pacific region, Vice President Lien Chan said on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Lien made the statement in an exclusive interview with a
four-member delegation from the Dow Jones press group, led by Karen
Elliott House, head of the US-based group's international department.</P>
      <P>This is the first time in recent months that Lien has been
interviewed by a renowned American news organization.</P>
      <P>During the one-hour interview, House focused on issues related to
the feasibility of Taiwan's participation in the US-initiated Theater
Missile Defense (TMD) system, top mainland negotiator Wang Daohan's
planned visit to Taiwan this autumn and Lien's candidacy for the
ROC's next presidency.</P>
      <P>House, who oversees all of Dow Jones' overseas publications,
including the Asian Wall Street Journal and the CNBC cable service,
first asked Lien about recent developments in relations between
mainland China and the United States, which have remained at a low
ebb since NATO mistakenly bombed mainland China's embassy in Belgrade
last month.</P>
      <P>Lien said he hopes Washington and Beijing will resolve their
disputes or issues through consultations and that neither of them
would take any actions to aggravate the situation and increase
obstacles to addressing their problems.</P>
      <P>"Both the ROC government and people hope to see mainland China
and the United States resolve their current disputes in various
field in a rational, pragmatic manner," Lien told House, adding that
he believes that such an attitude will be conducive to world peace
and stability.</P>
      <P>Lien went on to say that the ROC appreciates the US concern
about mainland China's missile threat to Taiwan and its repeated
reaffirmation of no change in its policy toward Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"We hope the United States will continue providing us
with adequate defensive weapons in accordance with the Taiwan
Relations Act to maintain military balance in the Taiwan Strait,"
Lien said.</P>
      <P>Noting that mainland China has not renounced its attempts to
use force against Taiwan, Lien said Taiwan "reserves" its rights to
take part in the TMD project.</P>
      <P>Asked about his views on top mainland envoy Wang Daohan's
planned visit to Taiwan later this year, Lien said Wang will be the
highest-ranking mainland representative to visit the island over the
past five decades.</P>
      <P>"Wang's visit will mark progress in cross-strait relations,"
Lien said, adding that the much-anticipated visit will enable Wang,
a former Shanghai mayor and mentor to mainland Chinese President
Jiang Zemin, to see for himself various aspects of the everyday life
here.</P>
      <P>Stressing that Wang's Taiwan visit is of great significance to
the development of cross-strait relations, Lien said he hopes Wang's
visit will help pave the way for resumption of regular cross-strait
dialogue to facilitate bilateral exchanges and better protect the
rights and interests of the people on both sides of the strait.</P>
      <P>Turning to ROC-US relations, Lien said the two countries share
many common ideals and interests. "We hope to furtehr reinforce
exchanges and cooperation with the United States in various fields
on the current basis," he added.</P>
      <P>Touching on Taiwan's next presidential election, House
asked Lien when he will formally announce his candidacy, and
the possibilities of his teaming up with former Taiwan
Governor James Soong in next year's presidential election and the
possible impact on Lien's presidential bid of Soong's participation
in the race as an independent candidate.</P>
      <P>Lien said he is not in a position to answer all those questions
at the moment because the ruling Kuomintang will not select its
presidential candidate until August. Lien, a KMT vice chairman, is
widely believed to represent the ruling party in next year's
presidential election.</P>
      <P>House, a senior, influential American journalist who once
received a Pulitzer prize, arrived in Taipei earlier this week to
attend a seminar sponsored by the Institute of International
Relations under National Chengchi University.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ARATS SET TO HOST CROSS-STRAIT MEETING IN BEIJING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Beijing,  June  24 (CNA)
(By Chang Lung and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Beijing is set to play host to a meeting
between the intermediary body Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Strait (ARATS) and its Taiwan counterpart, the Straits
Exchange Foundation (SEF), ARATS sources reported on Thursday.</P>
      <P>SEF Deputy Secretary-General Jan Jyh-horng is scheduled to lead a
Taiwan delegation to Beijing Sunday to meet his Beijing counterpart,
Li Yafei, to primarily discuss matters regarding the trip to Taiwan
this fall of the mainland's top negotiator with Taiwan Wang Daohan.</P>
      <P>ARATS sources said Jan will first meet with Li Sunday evening for
a preparatory meeting to work out the agendas for the two rounds of
talks scheduled for Monday.</P>
      <P>Jan's SEF delegates will meet with the ARATS group led by Li
Monday morning and afternoon for the two rounds of talks, which will
mainly focus on the details of Wang's Taiwan visit, the sources said.</P>
      <P>Jan will then meet with ARATS Vice Chairman Tang Shubei or
Secretary-General Zhang Jincheng Monday night or Tuesday morning,
according to the sources.</P>
      <P>Jan and his party are scheduled to leave Beijing for home
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>It is unclear whether ARATS will agree to talk about other
pragmatic matters, such as fishery disputes and the repatriation of
hijackers and illegal mainland Chinese immigrants -- issues Taiwan is
eager to discuss with mainland authorities.</P>
      <P>The SEF and ARATS are two quasi-official intermediary bodies
authorized by governments in the two sides to deal with exchanges
across the strait in the absence of formal contacts.</P>
      <P>The much-talked visit to Taiwan by Wang Dao-han was originally
scheduled for last October. It was postponed to this spring, and then
again to later in the year, probably October. It will be Wang's first
visit to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Wang's Taiwan counterpart, Koo Chen-fu, visited Beijing last
October for a landmark meeting with Beijing authorities.</P>
      <P>Koo and Wang first met in Singapore in 1993, marking the one and
only high-level meeting between Taiwan and mainland China in 50
years. During the meeting, the two sides established a formula for
regular SEF-ARATS gatherings.</P>
      <P>The Koo-Wang talks have since been unilaterally suspended by
Beijing after the regime there accused President Lee Teng-hui of
using his visit to the United States in May 1995 to promote Taiwan
independence.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FIRST SUSPECTED VIAGRA DEATH REPORTED IN HSINCHU</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  24 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A man in his 50s in Hsinchu may have died
as a result of Viagra-related heart problems, said sources from Chang
Kung Memorial Hospital on Thursday.</P>
      <P>The man's death is the first suspected of being connected to the
"magic pill," which was formally introduced in the country in March
this year.</P>
      <P>The man was rushed from a Hsinchu hospital to Chang Kung hospital
in Linko, Taipei County, in mid-April after he was stricken by an
acute myocardial infarction during sex, and about one hour after
taking a Viagra pill.</P>
      <P>He died of ventricular fibrillation at Chang Kung five days after
he was checked into the hospital. He never regained consciousness.</P>
      <P>Chang Kung physicians discovered that the man had chronic
cardiovascular disease and had been taking heart medicine regularly.</P>
      <P>Dr. Chiang Cheng-wen with Chang Kung's Cardiology and General
Medicine Department said the cause of death is not yet known,
pointing out that sex alone could be dangerous for a man with a heart
condition.</P>
      <P>Chiang urged people taking heart medicine not to take Viagra
rashly or to disregard doctors' instructions.</P>
      <P>Basically, the "small blue pill" should not be mixed with heart
medicine, he added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a Pfizer Taiwan spokesman said the company has not
been informed by Chang Kung about the incident.</P>
      <P>Pfizer, the manufacturer of the anti-impotence drug, also has no
idea where the man obtained the pills, which must be prescribed by
hospital doctors, the spokesman noted.</P>
      <P>Although a prescription medicine, Viagra so far is not included
in the national health insurance plan, which means people taking the
drug must pay for it themselves. A single 50-mg Viagra tablet costs
an average of NT$500 (US$15).</P>

      <P>Republic of China President Lee Teng-hui
Thursday received Panamanian Interior and Justice Minister Mariela
Sagel, and during the meeting he said the ROC is willing to share its
experience to help Panama develop its economy.</P>
      <P>Lee exchanged views on a broad range of subjects with Sagel, who
is involved in interior, judicial, transportation and communication
affairs in Panama.</P>
      <P>Lee pointed out that Panama is the bridge between North and South
America, and is situated at an ideal geographical position.
Consequently the central American country should make use of its
advantages to develop itself.</P>
      <P>The Panama Canal is especially meaningful to the country, Lee
said, adding that the Chinese people have a saying: "Water is
wealth." He suggested Panama look at ways to develop its agricultural
sector with the aid of canal water.</P>
      <P>Sagel expressed gratitude for the warm welcome she has received
during her visit, and said she was most impressed with the ROC's

    <TEXT>
      <P>John Chang, the ruling Kuomintang's
secretary-general said on Thursday he is prepared to meet with former
Taiwan Provincial Governor James Soong before August to discuss
Soong's views on the upcoming presidential election.</P>
      <P>But Chang told a group of grassroots KMT cadres, among whom Soong
is extremely popular, to brace themselves for the failure of attempts
to make Soong the running mate of Lien Chan, the incumbent vice
president and expected presidential candidate of the ruling party in
next year's election.</P>
      <P>Chang met with grassroots KMT members in Chiayi County Thursday
morning during which the question of whether and when Chang would
meet Soong was raised.</P>
      <P>Chang said the perfect time for him to meet with Soong would be
chosen and that the talks must result in a certain outcome.</P>
      <P>As KMT secretary-general, Chang said, it is his duty to meet with
Soong.</P>
      <P>But Chang said it makes no sense to urge "somebody" to be the
KMT's vice presidential candidate if that "somebody" is determined to
run for president, Chang said in reference to Soong, who has not
publicly declared his candidacy but who has traveled extensively in
Taiwan and abroad in what is seen as a pre-campaign tour to drum up
support.</P>
      <P>Considering that Soong is not only a member of the KMT but also
of its Central Standing Committee, it is regretful that he regularly
slams his own party, Chang said, urging Soong to communicate his
views without criticizing the party.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAC TO PROMOTE CROSS-STRAIT AGRICULTURAL EXCHANGES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  24 (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Agricultural exchanges between Taiwan and
mainland China should proceed according to organizational measures,
and relevant formal channels should be established, said a Mainland
Affairs Council (MAC) official Thursday.</P>
      <P>Fu Don-cheng, director of the Department of Economic Affairs
under MAC, made the remark at a seminar sponsored by MAC and attended
by agricultural officials and scholars.</P>
      <P>Fu pointed out to reporters that there were differences between
Taipei and Beijing over the issue of cross-strait agricultural
exchanges.</P>
      <P>The mainland authorities have an eye toward acquiring capital and
techniques from Taiwan, while the Taiwan side focuses on assisting
mainland farmers to improve their living standards and to increase
their incomes, instead of increasing productivity, which might result
in price plunges that would not improve mainland farmers' living
standards, Fu said.</P>
      <P>The consensus reached by Taiwan agricultural officials and
scholars is that mainland farmers should be offered management and
distribution techniques based on Taiwan's agricultural experiences,
said the MAC official. The two sides should also establish a
cross-strait agricultural exchange mechanism through
institutionalized dialogue, and work to prevent the smuggling of
agricultural products, he added.</P>
      <P>As to whether Jan Jyh-horng, deputy secretary-general of the
Taipei-based Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) would touch on
agricultural topics in meetings with mainland officials during an
upcoming visit to mainland China, Fu responded by pointing out that
cross-strait agricultural exchanges were one of eight points of
consensus reached during previous cross-strait talks.</P>
      <P>Those talks were held in preparation for a meeting between SEF
Chairman Koo Chen-fu and his mainland counterpart, Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) Chairman Wang Daohan. What
should be done at the present stage is to prepare well for that
meeting, he said.</P>
      <P>A delegation of eight or nine members, led by Jan, is expected to
head to Beijing Sunday to begin preparations for a meeting between
Koo and Wang later this year.</P>
      <P>Regarding the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in the southern
county of Tainan, Fu said it was caused by the smuggling of cattle
into Taiwan from the mainland.</P>
      <P>Taipei will not accept vaccines offered by the Chinese mainland,
Fu said. Since smuggling was the root of the problem, it would be
better to focus on preventing smuggling through joint efforts across
the Taiwan Strait, he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>WITHOUT BEIJING'S MISSILE THREAT, TAIWAN NEED NOT JOIN TMD: LEE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   June   24   (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Lee Teng-hui said on
Thursday there will be no need for the Republic of China to take part
in the US-initiated Theater Missile Defense (TMD) system so long as
communist China stops missile deployment against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lee made the remarks while meeting with a four-member delegation
from the US-based Dow Jones Group, led by Karen Elliott House, head
of the group's international department.</P>
      <P>House, a senior, influential American journalist who once
received a Pulitzer prize, asked Lee whether Taiwan would
participate in the costly TMD project.</P>
      <P>In response, Lee said it is unreasonable to demand Taiwan
refrain from taking any self-defense measures in the face of
mainland China's intensified missile deployment along its
southeastern coast opposite Taiwan in recent years.</P>
      <P>"So long as communist China stops using missiles to threaten
us, the ROC need not join the TMD system," Lee noted, adding that if
the ROC really takes part in the purely defensive system, it would
only help enhance the TMD's strategic values and contribute to peace
and stability in the Asia-Pacific region.</P>
      <P>Lee went on to say that the ROC has finalized bilateral
consultations with nearly all of its major trading partners
concerning terms for its entry to the World Trade Organization
(WTO).</P>
      <P>"Therefore, we earnestly hope that the Geneva-based world trade
regulatory body will consider our membership application completely
based on our own economic terms," Lee said, adding that the ROC's
WTO accession should not hinge on Beijing's membership application.</P>
      <P>For her part, House, who interviewed President Lee two years
ago, told Lee that she has been impressed by the ROC's progress,
particularly in the establishment of a democratic political system,
over the past decade.</P>
      <P>House arrived in Taipei earlier this week to attend a seminar
sponsored by the Institute of International Relations under National
Chengchi University.</P>
      <P>House, who oversees Dow Jones' overseas operations, including
the Asian Wall Street Journal and CNBC cable service, and her

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Lee Teng-hui said on Thursday
that the Republic of China's existence is critical to developments in
mainland China, Asia and the entire world.</P>
      <P>Lee made the statement while meeting with a delegation from the
American Assembly, a public policy research think tank
founded by Columbia University in 1950.</P>
      <P>The ROC president told his American guests that if Taiwan can
establish a peaceful, liberal and prosperous democracy, mainland
China is unlikely to maintain its status quo forever.</P>
      <P>"Inspired by the Taiwan experience, the whole of mainland China
is likely to be 'Taiwanized,'" Lee said, adding that should Taiwan
cease to exist, mainland China's hegemony would expand further and
pose a serious threat to Asia and the entire world.</P>
      <P>Lee went on to say the ROC fully understands that the Clinton
administration's "engagement" policy is mainly aimed at pushing
mainland China to accept international norms and regulations.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Lee said, the ROC hopes that the United States
will maintain parallel relations with the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait.</P>
      <P>Lee further said the "three wins" concept unveiled by US
President Bill Clinton when mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin
visited Washington, D.C. in 1997 is same as the ROC's goal.</P>
      <P>The "three wins" refer to balanced developments in three sets of
bilateral relations -- Taipei-Washington, Washington-Beijing and
Taipei-Beijing ties.</P>
      <P>Lee said he is hopeful that the US government will fully
implement provisions and spirit of the Taiwan Relations Act, further
enhance bilateral cooperation for mutual benefits, and help safeguard
peace, stability and prosperity in the Taiwan Strait area.</P>
      <P>For years, Lee said, the United States has been one of the ROC's
most important allies. Despite the absence of formal diplomatic
ties, Lee said the two countries share the same ideal of upholding
democracy, enjoy longstanding friendship and maintain close
exchanges and cooperation in economic, cultural, academic and
technological fields.</P>
      <P>In 1998, ROC-US trade amounted to US$49 billion. Taiwan is now
America's seventh largest trading partner, seventh largest import
source and export outlet.</P>
      <P>The American Assembly has set up a China Factor forum
and has sponsored many seminars in the United States and on
both sides of the Taiwan Strait, respectively, in recent years to
discuss issues related to Taipei-Washington-Beijing relations.</P>
      <P>The assembly is co-sponsoring in Taipei a seminar on cross-strait
ties with the Institute of International Relations under National
Chengchi University.</P>
      <P>The assembly delegation to the seminar was led by David Michael
Lampton. And its members included Daniel A. Sharp, Ezra F. Vogel,
William Clark, Karen Elliott House, and William P. Fuller.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAYOR MA OPENS TAIWAN'S FIRST DOMESTIC VIOLENCE PREVENTION CENTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  24  (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou on Thursday
pressed a button to symbolize the start of operations at the Taipei
Domestic Violence and Sexual Offense Prevention Center.</P>
      <P>Noting the center's motto of offering an entire team's worth of
assistance with a single telephone call, Ma announced the beginning
of the municipal government's fight against domestic violence, which
comes in the wake of the implementation of the new Domestic Violence
Prevention Law.</P>
      <P>Anyone who suffers from domestic or sexual violence can obtain
protection, assistance, medical care, housing and legal advice with
just one phone call, Ma said during an address at the center's
opening ceremony.</P>
      <P>Ma said the center's establishment challenges the traditional
Chinese belief that "no laws can run in the family," meaning laws
cannot settle domestic disputes. He added that Taiwan is the first
Asian country to have written laws concerning domestic affairs.</P>
      <P>The Domestic Violence Protection Law took full effect Thursday,
after the expiration of a one-year grace period initiated when it was
promulgated on June 24, 1998.</P>
      <P>The law helps victims of sexual or violent abuse at the hands of
spouses or relatives to obtain help, Ma said, noting that the
center's next task is to devise efficient assistance measures.</P>
      <P>The Taipei domestic violence and sexual offense Prevention Center
includes sections that provide a round-the-clock hotline, investigate
claims of abuse, provide protection to juveniles and adults, provide
medical care and manage administrative affairs. More than 30 social
workers will be employed at the center.</P>
      <P>All police stations and offices, along with 28 teaching hospitals
around the city, have joined in efforts to crack down on domestic
violence.</P>
      <P>Also on Tuesday, representatives of several women's associations,
led by Legislator Pan Wei-kang, who is also chairwoman of the Modern
Women's Foundation, jointly applied for a court protection order for
a woman whose husband poured sulfuric acid on her.</P>
      <P>The woman -- who now goes under the pseudonym Jentung -- married
last year into a loveless marriage, Pan said, adding that before the
domestic violence law went into effect, police could not become
involved in her situation, even after her husband poured sulfuric
acid on her, resulting in third-degree burns on more than 25 percent
of her body.</P>
      <P>In addition to seeking the court order, the groups also released
a joint statement in which they said they would invite scholars and
experts, as well as public representatives, to review official
operations islandwide aimed at preventing domestic violence next
month.</P>
      <P>The statement said the upcoming review will be focused on the
efficiency of the court's protection order, an indispensable means of
safeguarding the lives of domestic violence victims.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SUSPECT IN ARMED FORCES MUSEUM MURDER NABBED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  24  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A soldier of the Republic of China Armed
Forces has confessed that he raped and killed a high school girl in
the director's office of the Armed Forces Museum last week, police
said on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Police said the suspect, private first class Kuo Ching-ho, 21,
was one of a four-man team of three enlisted men and one officer
asked to guard the museum during the Dragon Boat Festival holiday
stretching from Friday through Sunday last week.</P>
      <P>Kuo told the police that on Saturday afternoon, when there were
few visitors in the museum, he followed the victim, Chang Fu-chen,
a student at Chingmei Girls' Junior High School who had come to the
museum to prepare a school report, to the third floor.</P>
      <P>He then offered to give her extra assistance in the director's
office, but when he tried to rape her, she put up a fight. Kuo
strangled his victim, wrapped her body in black plastic bags, and hid
it in the museum. He then rented a car in Shanchung, Taipei County,
and fled with a colleague to southern Taiwan before returning to
Taipei at around 4 a.m. on Sunday morning.</P>
      <P>He then returned to the museum, collected the body, and dumped it
in some bushes near a parking lot in Wuchuan Park in Panchiao, Taipei
County.</P>
      <P>The family of the victim had appealed to the public to help find
their daughter since her disappearance.</P>
      <P>Police said that Colonel Lee Ming-teh, the museum's director,
filed a police report after finding his office in disarray on Monday
when he returned from the long weekend holiday. However, to the
dismay of the police, he was unaware that it could be a crime scene,
and asked his orderly to clean up the mess, thereby destroying any
possible evidence.</P>
      <P>Chang's family also asked the museum to examine the video tapes
taken from the museum's 16 close-circuit security TVs, but it was
discovered that Kuo, who was placed in charge of the tapes during the
holiday period, could not account for the fact that the tape for
Saturday was missing, and that tapes marked June 18 and June 19 were
actually recorded on May 19 and May 31, respectively.</P>
      <P>The military turned Kuo over to the Panchiao District Court on
Thursday morning.</P>
      <P>Police said that Kuo, who lived with his mother and stepfather,
has no previous convictions. Because he is on active duty, he faces
an automatic death sentence.</P>

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Recent bullish performances by Taiwan's
stock market have not only resulted in an upbeat economic mood but
also fueled outbound tourism as well, the Taipei Association of
Travel Agents said on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Recently there have been more than 5,400 applications for
passports filed daily -- nearly double the number of daily
applications filed in previous months -- said an association
spokesman.</P>
      <P>According to the association, almost all travel agents around
Taiwan are enjoying a bonanza of bookings for overseas tours during
the upcoming summer months by Taiwan residents. Trips to Japan, the
United States and Southeast Asia are particularly popular, it said.</P>
      <P>Sources from the Foreign Ministry's Bureau of Consular Affairs
also noted that in recent days, the bureau has received an average of
5,400 applications for new passports daily, compared with an average
of 3,000 per day early this year. The increase in applications for
passports for children is particularly sharp, bureau officials said.</P>
      <P>The travel agents' association said mainland China was the only
place where fewer people are seeking to travel to these days.</P>
      <P>The association spokesman attributed the decline to hot weather,
poor sanitary conditions, and social and economic instability on the
mainland.</P>

    <DATELINE>Bangkok,  June  24  (CNA)
(By Kuo Fang-chih and Amanda Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The European Union, which unites 18
countries, could serve as a model for the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait of how to proceed with unification, Mainland Affairs Council
Vice Chairman Wu An-chia said in Bangkok on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Wu made the statement in an English-language speech delivered to
an audience of China affairs experts and members of the Thai media.</P>
      <P>Before moving toward an united Europe, the 18 countries were
first combined under the European Common Market, then gradually
introduced into the EU, Wu said. He added that the unification of
East and West Germany can also be a reference for Republic of China
and mainland China.</P>
      <P>However, mainland China has voiced opposition to both examples,
Wu noted.</P>
      <P>Wu, who is in charge of setting Taiwan's mainland affairs
policies, said he expects the political atmosphere between Taipei and
Beijing to be eased with the visit to Taiwan this autumn by Wang 
Daohan, the mainland's top negotiator with Taiwan, although he added
that he doubts that the time for political dialogue between the two
parties has come.</P>
      <P>Wu also pointed out that a summit between ROC President Lee
Teng-hui and his mainland Chinese counterpart Jiang Zemin during
September's Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum meeting in
New Zealand is out of the question, given Beijing's strategy of
opposing the ROC's place in the world community.</P>
      <P>Wu and other MAC officials are scheduled to complete their
three-day visit to Thailand on Thursday. Their next stop will be the
Philippines.</P>

    <HEADLINE>OPPOSITION LEGISLATOR LASHES OUT AT `FOREIGN LABOR DIPLOMACY'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  24  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Democratic Progressive Party
Legislator Chien Hsi-kai on Thursday lashed out at the government for
what he described as the use of foreign laborers to promote relations
with other countries.</P>
      <P>Chien claimed at a press conference that the approach has
exacerbated the jobless problem in Taiwan, which saw its unemployment
rate in May reach a 21-year high.</P>
      <P>Saying that "foreign labor diplomacy" has had a deep impact on
society, the legislator added that advanced countries rarely adopt
such measures.</P>
      <P>He said the ratio of foreign laborers in Taiwan is already the
second-highest in Asia, behind only Singapore, but accused the
government of continuing to play its "foreign laborer" card.</P>
      <P>In addition to the Filipino, Thai, Malaysian and Indonesian
laborers which are already here, Chien said the government is
considering the introduction of more foreign laborers from Central
and Southern America, North Korea, Vietnam and Macedonia (in the form
of Kosovar refugees).</P>
      <P>Chien said the number of foreign laborers in Taiwan has already
hit 300,000. Claiming that there are 270,000 unemployed laborers in
Taiwan, Chien said that there is no more room for any more foreign
laborers.</P>
      <P>Chien asked the government to review the policy of introducing
foreign laborers from Vietnam and Macedonia immediately.</P>
      <P>However, Su Hsiu-yi, deputy director of the Employment &amp;
Vocational Training Administration under the Council of Labor
Affairs (CLA), said that while the CLA has indeed had discussions
with Vietnam about introducing foreign laborers, no mention has ever
been made about introducing 40,000 Vietnamese workers, as claimed by
Chien, and the discussions have since been suspended.</P>
      <P>Su also stressed that the introduction of foreign laborers
follows strict quotas, and that the decision to employ foreign
laborers lies with domestic employers, and not the CLA. He backed his
assertion with the example that the government has wanted to
introduce foreign laborers from Nicaragua, but discussions in this
regard got nowhere because of a lukewarm response from local
employers.</P>
      <P>Su also dismissed Chien's claims about the Kosovar refugees,
pointing out that the government in fact plans to train 2,000 Kosovar
refugees in Taiwan, after which they will return to help rebuild
Kosovo rather than staying in Taiwan to work.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Philippine government on Thursday
sought the dismantling of Malaysian structures on Pawikan Shoal in
the Kalayaan (freedom) Island Group.</P>
      <P>A Philippine presidential spokesman said Foreign Affairs
Secretary Domingo Siazon relayed the demand during a call to
Malaysian Charge d' Affairs Rahman Badruddin.</P>
      <P>The Western Command of the Armed Forces of the Philippines
confirmed that Malaysia had constructed a helipad, a two story
building, and a radar tower at the southern tip of the disputed
Spratly islands.</P>
      <P>The Philippine government considers the structures a violation of
several agreements, including the ASEAN declaration on the South

the Heads of State and Government of ASEAN and China issued in Kuala

1998.</P>
      <P>The spokesman said the documents emphasize the need for all

satisfactory resolution of all disputes, and to promote peace and
stability in the area."</P>

      <P>The Republic of China's recent pledge to
provide US$300 million in aid for Kosovar refugees received wide
attention at a symposium sponsored by the Forum of the Future in
Paris on Thursday.</P>
      <P>At the symposium, organized to discuss the Kosovo crisis and the
region's rehabilitation, Wang Chen-tai, Taipei's representative to
Paris, raised ROC President Lee Teng-hui's June 7 announcement of the
huge aid pledge.</P>
      <P>In response, French Cooperation Minister Charles Josselin
described it as an impressive move, and said he believes the
international community will be encouraged by Taiwan's move.</P>
      <P>Ahigail Friedman, first secretary of the US Embassy in Paris,
said that reconstruction and development of the Balkan Peninsula
requires international participation, adding that Taiwan's aid will
be a great help to the region's stability and development.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's aid package for the Kosovar refugees consists of
emergency support in the form of food, shelter, medical care and
education, short-term accommodation for some refugees in Taiwan with
opportunities for job training, and support for Kosovar

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING'S THREATS PROMPT CALLS FOR TAIWAN INDEPENDENCE: MAC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Bangkok,  June  24  (CNA)
(By Kuo Fang-chih)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Wu An-chai, vice chairman of Taiwan's
Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) warned Beijing on Thursday the
stronger the military threat from mainland China, the more popular
the call for Taiwan independence will be.</P>
      <P>"Prior to Beijing's missile threat in March 1996, only 9 percent
of Taiwan's people preferred an overt breaking of relations with the
mainland. After that incident, this group of people increased to 21
percent," he said.</P>
      <P>Wu, who left Bangkok for Manila after a three-day visit, made the
remarks to high-ranking Thai government officials, academicians,
journalists and ethnic Chinese community leaders as well as Taiwan
investors in the kingdom.</P>
      <P>Wu said that surveys show that more than 80 percent of Taiwan
people prefer the maintaining of the status quo in cross-Taiwan
Strait relations, and oppose immediate unification or immediate
independence.</P>
      <P>However, the surveys also show that the popularity of Taiwan
independence is closely related to Mainland China's military threat
toward Taiwan, he said.</P>
      <P>A bigger space for Taiwan in the international community would
also help to alleviate pressure for Taiwan Independence, he pointed
out.</P>
      <P>According to Wu, many Taiwan people believe that if the name
"Republic of China" is not feasible for participating in
international organizations, the name "Republic of Taiwan" might be
an alternative to gain a role in these organizations.</P>
      <P>Analyzing cross-strait relations, Wu said "co-existence, mutual
prosperity and cooperation" will contribute to peaceful democratic
unification of the two sides and to the peace and stability of the
Asia-Pacific Region.</P>
      <P>In terms of cross-strait interaction, the ROC government has
followed two major tracks -- exchanges and negotiations -- to strive
for better relations, he said.</P>
      <P>Wu said a gradual process of negotiations will contribute to
stability in relations, and will also benefit the people's interests.</P>
      <P>Wu urged "Thai friends" to help the ROC fully enjoy the right to
take part in international organizations prior to unification, since
the two sides of the Taiwan Strait are under separate jurisdictions.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  24  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Boosted by improving economic prospects,
the Central Bank of China (CBC) estimates that Taiwan's economy will
grow by 5.15 percent this year, CBC Governor Perng Fai-nan said on
Thursday.</P>
      <P>The figure underlines the CBC's new confidence in the island's
economy compared to its March forecast of 4.8 percent, and the 5.07
percent growth predicted by the Directorate General of Budget,
Accounting and Statistics under the Executive Yuan.</P>
      <P>The CBC revised its forecast following an upward trend in
Taiwan's exports, coupled with a more rapid than expected stock
market recovery, and a rise in industrial indexes, said Perng.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's exports, measured in US dollars, have grown by 5 percent
in the first five months of this year, while public projects financed
by the government are pushing ahead as scheduled, which points to
brighter economic prospects, said Perng.</P>
      <P>Although the labor market is still slack, with the unemployment
rate standing at 2.78 percent in the five-month period, this has
helped minimize salary inflation pressure.</P>
      <P>Perng said that this. combined with declining import and
wholesale prices (with an average drop of 8.67 percent and 7.13
percent, respectively, in the January-May period), will speed up
economic expansion.</P>
      <P>With the declining unit labor cost and the slow climb of average
rents, which influences consumer prices heavily, the CBC predicted a
moderate 1.06 percent rise in consumer prices for this year, compared
to 0.48 percent for the first five months of the year, said Perng.</P>

      <P>The baby boy, who is now four months old, was diagnosed as

    <HEADLINE>CHINA'S DOMINANCE OF PANAMA CANAL SEEN AS A THREAT TO US</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  June  24  (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A US congressional delegation that
toured Central America in anticipation of the handover of the Panama
Canal at the end of this year concluded that mainland China's
dominance of the canal represents a threat to US security, according
to the delegation's report.</P>
      <P>The partly blacked-out report notes that "US and Panamanian
security officials stated that Panama has become the central base of
operations for Communist China in Latin America. Panama (City) is a
Pacific Ocean port, and the canal is vital to commerce between the
Asia-Pacific region and the Americas. It is also a vital component to
emerging Chinese Communist strategy to dominate the Pacific and to
undermine and isolate the United States."</P>
      <P>The number two user of the canal after the United States is
Japan, with mainland China and Taiwan competing for the third
position, said the congressional report.</P>
      <P>It pointed out that the unofficial representative of mainland
China in Panama is believed to be a senior intelligence officer who
operates out of an office on the top floor of a bank building in
Panama City, with a staff of 14 assistants.</P>
      <P>"Worldwide, China appears to be progressively positioning itself
commercially and militarily along the key naval choke points between
the Indian Ocean (its bases in Burma), the South China Sea (Hong
Kong), the Straits of Malacca (the Spratly Islands and a growing role
in Cambodia), the Central Pacific (a major satellite tracking station
on Tarawa), the coast of Hawaii (a major ocean mining tract), and the
Caribbean (Cuba and the Bahamas); and now the Panama Canal," said the
report.</P>
      <P>Mainland China's flagship commercial shipping fleet, China Ocean
Shipping Co. (COSCO), is directly connected to the mainland Chinese
government and People's Liberation Army, and COSCO ships have served
as carriers for the massive smuggling of weapons, drugs and illegal
aliens to destinations throughout the world.</P>
      <P>In addition, COSCO has been used by the mainland Chinese
government to ship missiles and components of weapons of mass
destruction to such nations as Pakistan and Iran, according to the
congressional delegation.</P>
      <P>Colombian insurgents have reportedly been conducting raids deep
inside Panama, taking advantage of US troop withdrawals, and they are
backed and supplied by Cuba, Russia and mainland China, according to
the report.</P>
      <P>"The growing anti-US/NATO 'strategic partnership' of China and
Russia poses an increasing threat. There is a well-documented history
of both Russian and Chinese organized crime organizations working as
tools of their governments. In Panama, where government corruption is
rampant, there is a dangerous convergence of well-financed Chinese
and Russian mobs with Cuban government operatives and Latin American
drug lords, leftists and narco-terrorist militants," said the
congressional delegation.</P>
      <P>"This dark partnership is a threat to democracy in Panama and in
neighboring countries, and is a direct long-term threat to Mexico and
the United States," the report concluded.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Indonesian government will permit
exiled East Timorese independence leader Jose Ramos Horta to set foot
in Jakarta for the first time in 23 years to join reconciliation
talks between rival factions in the contested territory.</P>
      <P>In a dispatch from Dili, capital of East Timor, The Australian 
reported that Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas announced that
three independent activists, including Nobel Peace Prize winner Ramos
Horta, would be granted visas to attend talks in Jakarta, reversing
his earlier stand of refusing to issue visas for them.</P>
      <P>The daily however reported that it is unclear whether Ramos
Horta, a Portuguese passport holder and resident of Australia, would
be allowed to travel to East Timor after he attends the
reconciliation talks in Jakarta, to be chaired by East Timor Catholic
bishops Carlos Belo and Basilio do Nascimento.</P>
      <P>In another dispatch from Dili, The Sydney Morning Herald reported
the United Nations has supported Ramos Horta's decision to fly to
Jakarta in an attempt to stem violence in East Timor during the
referendum vote.</P>
      <P>UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan this week indicated that the vote
on the future of East Timor would be delayed for at least two weeks
from the scheduled date of Aug. 8 because of harassment and
intimidation by pro-Indonesian militiamen.</P>

      <P>The first joint meeting of the Taiwan-
Britain Business Council (TBBC) opened Friday, with both parties
proposing to jointly invest in the vast markets of mainland China and
India.</P>
      <P>Leslie Koo, co-chairman of the TBBC, said that with the political
ties and close commercial relationship between Britain and mainland
China and with Taiwan's manufacturing, research and development
technology, Taiwan can best enter the mainland market by closely
cooperating with Britain.</P>
      <P>Vice Minister of Economic Affairs Lin Yi-fu, Finance Minister
Paul Chiu and Ambassador-at-large and Euro-Asia Trade Organization
Chairman Jeffery Koo attended the conference, as did British
Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) Director Mike Cohen,
Confederation of British Industry Director-General Adari Turner and
Rolls-Royce Plc. President Colin H. Green.</P>
      <P>During his welcoming remarks, Jeffery Koo said Taiwan's overall
investment in Britain amounts to only US$20 million, while British
businessmen have poured US$90 million into Taiwan. He urged
ministerial-level officials from Britain to visit Taiwan and discuss
with their Taiwan counterparts ways to boost two-way trade.</P>
      <P>In response, Turner of the Confederation of British Industry
promised to work toward achieving this goal.</P>
      <P>It is believed that ministerial-level exchanges are increasing,
said Leslie Koo, noting that British Trade Minister Brian Wilson
visited Taiwan for an economic and trade conference last March, while
ROC Economic Affairs Minister Wang Chih-kang is slated to lead a

      <P>Technological collaboration in the fields of bio-chemistry and

      <P>Wu Rong-I, president of the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research
(TIER), said the overall recovery in Taiwan's domestic economic
recovery started between the end of the first quarter and the
beginning of the second quarter, and that it will become even
stronger during and after the third quarter.</P>
      <P>To date, continued Wu, the resurgence trend is very clear, and
the economic growth in 1999 may well achieve the 5.28 percent
estimated by TIER in April.</P>
      <P>The Central Bank of China (CBC) on Thursday announced an upward
revision of its own economic annual growth estimate for the island to
5.15 percent, which is a little higher than the 5.07 percent
estimated by the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and
Statistics (DGBAS).</P>
      <P>A survey report for May released by TIER on Friday shows that
39.9 percent of manufacturers expect better economic prospects in the
next six months (from June to November), a slight decline from
April's survey report of 41.4 percent. However, those expecting worse
economic performance declined to 13.5 percent from April's 13.8
percent, and those expecting the situation to remain the same rose to
46.6 percent from April's 44.8 percent.</P>
      <P>The TIER official indicated that taken overall, the figures
reveal manufacturers hold an optimistic attitude toward domestic
economic prospects for the near future.</P>
      <P>Since most East Asian countries have now recovered from the Asian
financial turmoil, Taiwan's exports to the region are sure to be
boosted, Wu stressed.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GERMAN GROUP OFFERS TO PROVIDE SHELTER FOR TAIWAN STRAY DOGS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  25  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A German animal rights protection group
has offered to provide shelter for Taiwan's stray dogs, a local
animal rights activist said on Friday.</P>
      <P>Shen Rong-chen, president of the ROC Animal Protection
Association, said the Germany Animal Protection Association now
plans to launch a fund-raising campaign aimed at transporting Taiwan
strays to Germany for settlement.</P>
      <P>Noting that it takes about NT$10,000 (US$307.7) to send a stray
dog to Germany from Taiwan, Shen said the German association has a
1,000-ping shelter for strays. One ping is about 36 square feet.</P>
      <P>According to Shen, the German association will first provide
shelter to crippled or abused strays.</P>
      <P>In May, two German animal rights activists brought to Taiwan
300,000-plus letters written by pet lovers and ordinary people in
Germany, Switzerland, Britain and Austria expressing their concern
about the Republic of China government's policy toward stray dogs
and the situation of Taiwan strays.</P>
      <P>At that time, the two German activists -- Dirk Stegen, director
of Germany's Karlscuhe animal health research institute, and Christa
Schechtl, a wildlife conservation journalist, noted that Taiwan has
made some progress in treatment of stray animals.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, they said Taiwan must make further improvement in
providing better shelter for healthy stray animals and administering
euthanasia for terminally ill strays.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the German association's drive to transport Taiwan
strays to Germany, the Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture (COA)
said it hopes animal rights activists at home and abroad can give it
more time to handle the stray dog issues.</P>
      <P>Taiwan currently has about 1 million stray dogs. "It's no easy
task to perfectly resolve problems related to such a large
number of strays in a short period of time," said Lee Chin-lung,
director of the COA's Animals and Plants Quarantine Bureau.</P>
      <P>Lee said the COA has earmarked a budget of NT$80 million in the
current fiscal year for handling strays. Moreover, the Cabinet has
agreed to subsidize many local city and county governments in
building new shelters for stray animals.</P>
      <P>Lee said the ROC government has stepped up efforts to improve
treatment of strays. "This year, we have given the top priority to
personnel training and improving facilities at government-run
stray animal shelters."</P>
      <P>Lee further said the COA is cooperating with the Ministry of
Education and the Environmental Protection Administration to
improve treatment of strays and educate the public how to treat
stray animals.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIPEI MAYOR REVIEWS FIRST SIX MONTHS IN OFFICE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  25  (CNA)
(By Wendy Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou celebrated six
months in office on Friday, and in a review of his administrative
team's work, said he will build the city's administration from a
"show house into a real home."</P>
      <P>Deputy mayors Ou Chin-der and Pai Hsiu-hsiung, and all heads of
the municipal government departments joined Ma for a press conference
to deliver his review.</P>
      <P>Ma said he believed that the administration has done a pretty
good job over the last 180 days, but pledged to do even better in the
future. He also said he has now adjusted to his office, as have all
his staff.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, Ma did not rule out the possibility of making
some changes in his administrative team, but added that the
"appropriate time" has not arrived yet.</P>
      <P>Ma opened the press conference by thanking the 82,000 members of
the municipal government for their hard work over the last six
months, but stressed that if the first six months of his four years'
term in office represents the first kilometer of a race, Ma said he
and his team of "long-distance runners" will continue to exert
themselves over the remaining seven kilometers.</P>
      <P>He then went on to report on the six major administrative
achievements of his administration, and listed six main objectives
for the future.</P>
      <P>Ma pointed out that between January and May this year, violent
crime has declined by 37.58 percent compared to the same period of
last year, while burglaries have fallen by 12.99 percent. In the same
period, a safe telephone ordering system for taxis, and a Domestic
Violence and Sexual Offense Prevention Center have begun operation,
he noted.</P>
      <P>Traffic control measures implemented by his administration
include the elimination of illegal roadway obstructions and strict
enforcement of new laws on drunken driving.</P>
      <P>Attempts to promote a "digital municipal government," he said,
twelve Internet connections have been set up to make data searching
for citizens more convenient.</P>
      <P>Turning to environmental protection measures, he cited the
resolution of the problem of pollution of the Tamsui River by
wholesale poultry farms, together with a concrete plan to reduce the
number of stray dogs in the city.</P>
      <P>In cultural and artistic promotions, the city government is not
only preparing for the establishment of a new cultural department,
but has also held several large-scale public events such as the
Taipei Lantern Festival, he said.</P>
      <P>Finally, Ma said, in the care of underprivileged groups, the city
government not only held the first religious funeral ceremony for
laborers, but also resolved the contentious "diver's symptom"
incidents involving workers on the city's underground mass rapid
transit lines. In addition, the administration also raised the
proportion of aborigines hired as non-public servant employees.</P>
      <P>Ma's six major objectives included forward-looking city
development plans, living environment safety, sustainable development
of the city environment, impartial city society, diversified city
culture and participatory city politics.</P>
      <P>Important items for future development include completing the
mass rapid transit system's Hsintien line, overall monitoring of
hillside land use, garbage disposal fee collection, and establishment
of the cultural bureau and a citizen's social welfare forum.</P>
      <P>In response to the much-discussed issue of transfer of government
heads, Ma said that since the Taipei Municipal Council is still in
the process of budget examination, the timing is not yet right for
personnel transfers.</P>
      <P>Ma declined requests to grade his achievements, saying: "I never
grade myself, since I cannot be objective while being both player and
referee."</P>

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING URGED TO SET DATES FOR WANG DAOHAN'S TAIWAN VISIT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  25  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's top negotiator with mainland
China on Friday urged Beijing to present definite dates for its
envoy's planned visit to this island in autumn.</P>
      <P>Koo Chen-fu, chairman of the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF),
made the appeal during a SEF board meeting.</P>
      <P>Koo said Wang Daohan, president of the Beijing-based Association
for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS), accepted his
invitation to visit Taiwan this year when he made an ice-melting
visit to the mainland last October.</P>
      <P>SEF and ARATS are quasi-official intermediary bodies authorized
by their respective governments to handle cross-strait exchanges in
the absence of official ties.</P>
      <P>Koo said although mainland China tentatively proposed in
March that Wang visit Taiwan this autumn, it has so far not
come up with a definite itinerary for Wang's trip.</P>
      <P>Koo said he hopes that the two sides will be able to finalize
an itinerary for Wang's visit during SEF Deputy Secretary-General Jan
Jyh-horng's upcoming trip to Beijing.</P>
      <P>Jan will head a SEF delegation to visit Beijing from June 27-29.
In addition to working out Wang's itinerary, Koo said he is hopeful
that Jan will discuss with ARATS officials several pressing issues
related to rights and interests of people on both sides of the
Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>"Those practical issues include repatriation of mainland
hijackers and illegal immigrants as well as prevention of the spread
of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) among cloven-hoofed animals and
protection of safety of Taiwan investors in mainland China," Koo
said, adding that Beijing should respond to Taiwan's call for
resumption of regular SEF-ARATS dialogue as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC),
which charts Taiwan's policy toward mainland China and oversees SEF
operation, also reiterated its welcome to Wang's planned Taiwan
visit.</P>
      <P>"We hope Wang can visit Taiwan as early as possible to continue
constructive dialogue across the Taiwan Strait," MAC Vice Chairman
Sheu Ke-sheng said, adding that Taiwan will do its utmost to ensure
that Wang's "get to know Taiwan" journey will proceed in a safe,
comfortable, sincere and constructive atmosphere.</P>
      <P>Sheu said the MAC will be pleased to see SEF-ARATS exchanges
increase steadily to forge mutual trust and pave the way for
resumption of regular cross-strait dialogue and create an
environment conducive to higher-level cross-strait contact and
cooperation in various fields.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou on Friday
declined to comment on the idea of a ruling Kuomintang presidential
ticket of Vice President Lien Chan with former Taiwan Governor James
Soong as his running-mate in next year's presidential election.</P>
      <P>Ma, who held a press conference on Friday to mark six months in
office and review his administration's achievements during the
period, said he had been too busy running the city and working toward
unity and reform of his party, the KMT, to pay attention to media
speculation on the presidential candidates.</P>
      <P>He expressed the belief that as long as the KMT can unite and
reform itself, the party will win the 2000 presidential election.
This is how the Taipei mayoral election was won last year, he pointed
out.</P>
      <P>Responding to public opinion which holds that he is "too honest
and sincere," and thus lacks the boldness for a firm administrative
hand, Ma replied that he does not "wear dominance on his face," but
would rather "apply force with his hands."</P>
      <P>He also stressed that he is a man of long-term commitments rather
than a "sprinter," and pledged to continue to serve the city. He
emphasized that his administration has already done a great deal, not
all of which has been explained and broadcast to the public.</P>
      <P>Now that his administrative team has finished warming up and had
adjusted its pace, he said it is ready to increase its speed in the
race toward the next millennium.</P>

      <P>The Taiwan stock market should rise further
in the third quarter of this year, said a researcher with the Taiwan
Institute for Economic Research on Friday.</P>
      <P>Tung Jui-pin, chief of the institute's sixth department, told
reporters that judging from Taiwan's current economic fundamentals
and the trend of its economic performance, the Taiwan Stock Exchange
(TSE) is expected to go up during the July-September period.</P>
      <P>He said that the TSE weighted price index's registered steady
gains the past few months are mainly due to the influx of foreign
capital. Tung also pointed out that Taiwan's economic fundamentals
are sound.</P>
      <P>He predicted that Taiwan's economic performance in the third
quarter will be even stronger than it is currently, causing a rise in
the local stock market.</P>
      <P>The TSE weighted price index plummeted 323.35 points to 8,265.96
on Friday, the largest single-day drop this year.</P>

      <P>The Republic of Nauru will not join the
United Nations (UN) at the expense of abandoning its friendly ties
with the Republic of China, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
said Friday.</P>
      <P>MOFA made the remark after Nauru was not admitted into the UN on
June 22 due to opposition from mainland China.</P>
      <P>A membership screening committee organized by 15 member countries
of the UN Security Council (UNSC) screened the applications of Nauru
and Kiribati, two Pacific island nations on June 22.</P>
      <P>Beijing, a standing UNSC member, vetoed Nauru's UN membership
because of the island country's diplomatic relations with the ROC.</P>
      <P>T.J. Shih, director of MOFA's Department of Asia-Pacific Affairs,
said Nauru became a member country of the British Commonwealth of
Nations on May 1.</P>
      <P>Nauru's seeking to join the UN was welcomed by the international
community and was totally in accordance with the UN principle of
universality, Shih said. He slammed Beijing for blocking Nauru's UN
membership, saying international support for the island-country would

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's private sector has decided to form
a fact-finding mission to visit Kosovo to gain a better understanding
of the needs of the ethnic Albanian refugees after they returned to
their home in the Serb-controlled Yugoslavian province from
neighboring regions.</P>
      <P>At a meeting held Friday at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
(MOFA), representatives of a dozen social welfare organizations,
including World Vision of Taiwan, the ROC Red Cross Society, Buddhist
Compassion Relief Tzu Chi Foundation, and Chinese Association for
Human Rights, agreed to form a seven-member delegation to visit
Kosovo in early July.</P>
      <P>It was also decided that all participating charity groups should
continue to gather information on refugees' needs through their own
channels, while the MOFA will help in financing and helping carry out
relief programs, Andrew L. Y. Hsia, head of the MOFA's International
Organizations Department, said.</P>
      <P>So far, World Vision of Taiwan, which has sent personnel to
Kosovo, has raised NT$11.75 million (about US$370,000) in fund, and
the MOFA is willing to offer an equal or double amount to jointly
realize the varied aid projects, he noted.</P>
      <P>According to Hsia, the private sector will play a major role in
the first-stage operations of a Republic of China's US$300 million
aid package to Kosovo.</P>
      <P>Civil charity organizations are in a good position to offer
immediate assistance to the refugees, while government organizations
will focus on much heavier restructuring plans such as building roads
and bridges, and restoring electricity supply, Hsia said.</P>
      <P>The ROC embassy in neighboring Macedonia, which has taken a large
number of ethnic Albanian refugees following NATO's bombings of
Kosovo, will also provide concrete proposals to Taiwan's charity
groups to help them proceed with their aid programs, Hsia added. It
is understood that winter clothes, blankets, medicine, and wheel
chairs are the most wanted items among refugees.</P>
      <P>World Vision of Taiwan Chairman C. M. Shao said the
Taiwan fact-finding mission, accompanied by officials of an
international humanitarian organization, will stay in Kosovo for four

    <TEXT>
      <P>A recent speech by Chairman Koo Chen-fu of
Taipei's Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) on building a peaceful and
stable cross-Taiwan Strait relationship has been recorded in the US
congressional record.</P>
      <P>In his English-language speech at a panel discussion of the 48th
General Assembly of the International Press Institute in Taipei on
May 18, Koo echoed the proposal of US Assistant Secretary of State
Stanley Roth that Beijing and Taipei sign "interim agreements" on
some practical issues with a view to improving bilateral relations.</P>
      <P>The decision to put Koo's speech into the congressional record
indicates the US legislative branch's support for Beijing and Taipei
signing several "interim agreements" and continuing in constructive
dialogues.</P>
      <P>Koo remarked that Roth's proposal for signing "interim agreements"
does not necessarily call for the signing of an agreement on
establishing a "big framework" for cross-strait engagement or talks.</P>
      <P>Instead, he said he thinks Roth's suggestion refers to the
signing of multiple agreements on issues concerning the rights of
people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>"All these pacts are interim agreements, which are expected to
help improve cross-strait relations gradually and steadily," he
noted.</P>
      <P>On the "one China" issue, Koo said, "It is my view that China is
now divided, and both Taiwan and the mainland are parts of China and
the two sides are ruled by two distinct political entities, with
neither side subordinate to the other."</P>
      <P>In his speech, the SEF chairman also mentioned Republic of China
President Lee Teng-hui's 1995 six-point proposal on normalizing
cross-strait relations, and reviewed the results of his talks last
October with Chairman Wang Daohan of Beijing's Association for

    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China (ROC) Senior Presidential
Adviser Ding Mou-shih recently became a trustee of the International
Crisis Group (ICG) under the recommendation of the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs (MOFA), the ministry said on Friday.</P>
      <P>The ICG is a non-governmental, non-profit private organization
founded in July 1995 with the aim of strengthening the international
society's awareness of danger zones that might disrupt world peace.</P>
      <P>When the ICG was first established, Straits Exchange Foundation
(SEF) Chairman Koo Chen-foo served as the ROC trustee. He later
passed his position to Jeffrey Koo, chairman of the Chinese National
Association of Industry and Commerce.</P>
      <P>Jeffry Koo recently resigned from his post, and Ding took over
under MOFA's recommendation.</P>
      <P>MOFA Deputy Director of International Organizations Tung Kuo-yu
in response to reporter's questions said that the ICG is presently
monitoring eight regions in the world, and will later send analysis
reports to each nation's president, foreign ministers and press.</P>
      <P>The eight regions are Bosnia, Albania, Macedonia, Algeria, the
Republic of Burundi, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Cambodia and
Yugoslavia.</P>
      <P>ROC President Lee Teng-hui on June 7 pledged a US$300 million aid
package for the reconstruction of Kosovo, whether the ROC will extend
its aid through Ding's position in the ICG is the center of much
attention.</P>
      <P>Tung said that the ROC has attempted to contact the ICG, but does
not know at present how or what role the organization will play in
the reconstruction of Kosovo.</P>
      <P>He said that ICG is one of Taiwan's choices for channeling the
assistance to Kosovo. But he added that since the organization is
specialized in crisis prevention rather than relief operations and
resconstructrion, whether it is a suitable channel remained to be
weighed.</P>
      <P>The ICG has 47 trustees on its board, most of whom are renowned
international political leaders. They include former presidents,
premiers and ministers. Member countries include Belgium, Norway, the

    <HEADLINE>BRITISH PRIVATE ENTERPRISES SUPPORT TAIWAN'S WTO ENTRY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  25  (CNA)
(By David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>British private enterprises support the
Republic of China joining the World Trade Organization (WTO) and
support Taiwan's goal of becoming an Asia-Pacific operations center,
a British industrialist said Friday.</P>
      <P>Adair Turner, director-general of the Confederation of British
Industry, made the remark while calling on Vice Economics Minister
Lin Yi-fu. Turner also said he hopes the ROC will further open its
financial market to allow foreign investment.</P>
      <P>Turner came to Taiwan to attend the first joint meeting of the
Taiwan-Britain Business Council (TBBC).</P>
      <P>The TBBC is a regular communication and exchange channel for
ranking Taiwan and British business executives. Its main purpose is
to promote bilateral technology cooperation, strategy alliance as
well as to increase trade opportunities.</P>
      <P>Turner, on behalf of British private enterprises, supports the
ROC's entry into the WTO as soon as possible in order to further
liberalize its market.</P>
      <P>He said that British private enterprises were very impressed by
the stability of the Taiwan economy during last year's Asian
financial turmoil.</P>
      <P>Customs house statistics show that Taiwan's trade with Britain in
the first five months of this year totaled US$2.13 billion, up 1.5
percent from the same period last year. Of the total, exports to
Britain were valued at US$1.42 billion and import reached US$714.70
million, with a trade surplus of US$709.20 million in Taiwan's
favor.</P>
      <P>The United Kingdom is the ROC's third largest export market in
Europe as well as its third largest source of imports. Because
Britain encourages foreign investment, Taiwan enterprises have
gradually become more and more important to English entrepreneurs.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US RESOLUTION INTRODUCED ON PANAMA CANAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  June  25  (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>US Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-CA) has
introduced a House resolution prohibiting US assistance to Panama if
a defense site or military installation built or formerly operated by
the United States is provided by the Panamanian government to any
foreign government-owned entity.</P>
      <P>A US congressional delegation that recently toured Central
America in anticipation of the handover of the Panama Canal at the
end of this year concluded in its report that mainland Chinese
dominance of the Panama Canal zone represents a threat to US
security.</P>
      <P>The US-Panama Security act of 1999, introduced by Hunter on June
16, was referred for consideration to the House Committees on
International Relations, Banking and Financial Services, Armed
Forces, and Intelligence.</P>
      <P>Hunter noted that a recent grant to Hutchison Whampoa, a Hong
Kong firm with ties to the Beijing government, of management control
of the Panamanian ports at either end of the Panama Canal has raised
the specter of the expansion of mainland Chinese political influence
in Panama, a situation aggravated by unanswered questions concerning
the methods used by the Hong Kong firm to win its bid.</P>
      <P>The resolution requires the US president to submit to the
Congress a report explaining how Hutchison Whampoa was selected to
receive a grant for management control of the Panamanian ports at
either end of the Panama Canal, and whether or not the US government
had any knowledge of ties between the Hong Kong firm and the Beijing
regime.</P>
      <P>The bill also requires the secretary of defense to report to the
Congress on the extent to which such control by Hutchison Whampoa
poses a threat to the security of the United States, and how the US
strategic interests with respect to the Panama Canal will continue to
be protected after its handover to Panama.</P>
      <P>In addition, the resolution requires the director of the Central
Intelligence Agency to submit an annual report by March 31 on
mainland Chinese intelligence activities against or affecting US
interests in Panama.</P>
      <P>The resolution also authorizes and directs the US president to
confer with the Panamanian government to renegotiate the Panama Canal
Treaty and the Treaty Concerning the Permanent Neutrality and
Operation of the Panama Canal, or negotiate a new agreement for the
purpose of providing the security of the canal into the next century.
Any negotiations should include the right to control or prohibit the
use of the Panama Canal by hostile powers, terrorist states or
criminal groups.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A former cabinet minister of British
Columbia's New Democratic Party government on Friday pleaded guilty
to charges of fraud, theft, forgery and breach of trust.</P>
      <P>Dave Stupich had been at the center of the so-called "Bingogate"
scandal, in which the NDP was accused of funneling lottery money into
party coffers.</P>
      <P>The scandal helped bring about the resignation of Premier Mike
Harcourt even though he wasn't directly involved. It has dogged the
current NDP leader and Premier Glen Clark.</P>
      <P>Stupich, 77, faced 64 charges, which were dated between 1976 and
1995. He was agriculture minister and briefly finance minister in the
NDP government of 1972-1975.</P>
      <P>Earlier this month, the NDP announced it would repay part of the
money. A total of C$117,948, including interest, has since been

    <HEADLINE>COURT RULING SEEN PUSHING AUSTRALIA TOWARD A REPUBLIC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,   June   26  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An Australian High Court ruling
disqualifying a One Nation candidate this week of her eligibility to
become senator will have a far-reaching impact on Australia's push to
become a republic, according to political analysts.</P>
      <P>The court made a landmark decision to disqualify Heather Hill,
chief adviser to One Nation leader Pauline Hanson, of taking a seat
in the Senate on July 1 because she did not renounce her British
citizenship when she was nominated as candidate to take part in the
October 3 federal election.</P>
      <P>Analysts said the Hill case will bolster the argument that the
time has arrived for Australians to make their last symbolic break
with Britain, which four out of the seven judges at the High Court
described as a foreign power.</P>
      <P>Other experts said the Hill case will serve as a striking example
to many Australians who support their country becoming a republic.</P>
      <P>Australia will hold a national referendum in November to decide
whether to sever the remaining ties with Britain.</P>
      <P>Recent public polls show more than 50 percent of Australian
people want a republic. But the monarchist movement in Australia is
also quite strong, with support of about 40 percent of the
population.</P>
      <P>Analysts believe there are still many Australians who have dual
nationality, with the number ranging from four to five million. They
have no problem so long as they do not run for any elections,
but they must renounce their original nationality if they want to
become politicians.</P>

    <HEADLINE>COUNCILWOMAN'S FATHER ATTENDS MAINLAND CHINA MURDER TRIAL OPENING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   June  26  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Eleven months after Kaohsiung City
Councilwoman Lin Ti-chuan was murdered in mainland China, her father
departed Saturday on the sad journey to the mainland to attend the
opening of the trial of his daughter's murderers.</P>
      <P>The trial is scheduled to open at a Liaoning provincial court on
Monday, and Lin's father is seeking compensation of 44 million
renminbi (about NT$170 million) from the perpetrators of the crime.</P>
      <P>Four men involved in the case have been turned over to Anshan
Intermediate People's Court on various charges of intentional
assault, robbery, and unlawful restraining the freedom of movement,
but the group's mastermind, Lee Guangzhi, is still at large.</P>
      <P>The request for compensation, the highest amount in any previous
case filed across the Taiwan Strait, is not expected to be fully met,
but it is hoped that it will set a precedent for Taiwan crime victims
in the mainland seeking compensation in the future.</P>
      <P>Lin Ping-huei, accompanied by his lawyer and an official of the
opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), said at the airport
before his departure that main priority is to seek justice for the
death of his daughter.</P>
      <P>Councilwoman Lin, a rising political star in the DPP, traveled
with her boyfriend Wei Tien-kang to Dalian in northern mainland China
in late July, where they were abducted by armed men and repeatedly
given shots of unknown drugs. Wei managed to escape to alert the
police, but was too late to save Lin, who died of a drug overdose at
a hospital.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of National Defense (MND) has
promised to set up a special committee to investigate various tragic
accidents in the military in recent years.</P>
      <P>Defense Minister Tang Fei made the promise after the families of
several conscripts who died in military accidents staged a
demonstration in front of the ministry on Saturday.</P>
      <P>The families, who have formed an association to promote human
rights in the military, demanded that the MND investigate and unveil
the true causes of their sons' death in a more transparent way.</P>
      <P>In response, Tang agreed to form a special committee to
investigate such incidents. In addition to MND officials, the
committee will also include elected representatives, various key
opinion leaders, and representatives of the victims' families, in
order to enhance transparency and ensure impartiality in the
investigative process.</P>
      <P>The demonstration took place coincidentally with the convening of
a meeting of senior military officers on the streamlining of military
discipline after a soldier raped and murdered a high school student
inside the Armed Forces Museum in downtown Taipei last Saturday.</P>
      <P>The demonstrators wore headbands and carried posters demanding
the MND unveil the truth about their sons' accidental deaths while
fulfilling their mandatory military service. They blasted the
military for failing to keep its investigative processes transparent.
As a result, they said, many military-related accidents have remained
shrouded in mystery.</P>
      <P>Minor clashes erupted between demonstrators and military police
when some protesters tried to force their way into the MND building.
The Chungcheng branch of the Taipei City Police Headquarters sent
dozens of police officers to help maintain law and order at the site.</P>
      <P>The clashes ended after Tang assigned several senior military
officers to receive representatives of the victims' families and
assure them of the MND's determination to streamline military
discipline and improve handling of accidents in the military.</P>
      <P>Vice Admiral Fang Shou-lu, a senior naval officer, also told the
representatives that the MND has already set up a military human
rights protection commission, which went into operation in March.</P>
      <P>"In response to your request, Minister Tang has also agreed to
form a special military accident investigation committee to ensure
impartiality and transparency in investigating the true causes of all
such accidents," Fang told the representatives.</P>

cooperation conference, originally slated to be held on July 5 in

      <P>It is understood that the two countries are poised to negotiate

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An independent presidential hopeful said
on Saturday that Taiwan's next presidential election may produce a
lame-duck president.</P>
      <P>Hsu Hsin-liang, a former chairman of the Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) who broke ranks with Taiwan's largest opposition party
last month with an aim to run in next year's presidential election
on his own right, made the forecast while attending an event at the
Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall complex.</P>
      <P>Hsu said that if former Taiwan Governor James Soong breaks ranks
with the ruling Kuomintang and joins the 2000 presidential race as an
independent, none of the candidates in the election will be able to
win more than 40 percent of the vote.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, Hsu predicted that no matter who wins the
election, he or she will almost certainly be a lame-duck president.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Hsu said Soong's departure from the KMT would result in
the splitting of the ruling party and the consequent restructuring of
all major Taiwan political parties.</P>
      <P>Should that be the case, Hsu further forecast that Taiwan's
government after 2000 will be one that transcends party politics,
the ethnic divide and the independence/unification controversy.</P>
      <P>The outspoken politician went on to say that Soong's stern
criticism of the KMT leadership indicates that a "Lien-Soong" ticket
is unlikely to become a reality. Lien refers to Vice President Lien
Chan who is almost certain to be the KMT's standard bearer in the
2000 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Hsu said he does not believe that incumbent Tainan
County Magistrate Chen Tang-shan, a DPP heavyweight, would team up
with Soong in the coming presidential election.</P>
      <P>"If a Soong-Chen ticket really appears, it would signify a
gradual meltdown of party divide and would eventually lead to party
restructuring here," Hsu noted.</P>
      <P>Hsu originally planned to accompany a group of child
cancer patients on a voyage aboard a naval ship. However, he was
forced to drop the plan because of opposition from the Ministry of
National Defense, according to a local press report.</P>
      <P>Hsu instead showed up at the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall
complex to see the child cancer patients off on the specially
designed voyage, organized by the private Chou Ta-kuan Cancer
Foundation.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan is considering raising its
investment in Panama's Fort Davis Industrial Zone from the current
level of US$17 billion to US$20 billion, the Cabinet-level Council
for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) said on Friday.</P>
      <P>The CEPD made the announcement after a meeting with the Ministry
of Foreign Affairs and the Central and South American Investment
Corp.</P>
      <P>According to the CEPD, Taiwan's top economic planning government
agency, it will also suggest the Panamanian government ease
regulations on visa extensions and permanent residency, simplify its
procedures and provide greater access to loans for Taiwan businessmen
and technical personnel.</P>
      <P>It was also decided in the Friday meeting that relevant
government agencies will join forces in sponsoring investment
seminars in North America, Central America and South America to
attract investors to the Fort Davis Industrial Zone.</P>
      <P>The Republic of China and Panama signed an memorandum of
understanding in 1995, with the two sides agreeing to jointly develop
the 100-hectare Fort Davis Industrial Zone, a former US military
base. Currently, less than 50 hectares in the compound have been

      <P>Domestic fixed investment is expected to
increase in the second quarter of this year, boosted by a bullish
stock market and expanding exports, the Directorate General of
Budget, Accounting &amp; Statistics (DGBAS) said on Friday.</P>
      <P>According to DGBAS data, fixed domestic investment in the first
quarter dropped 12.5 percent compared to the same period of last
year, but the import of capital equipment has increased 12.8 percent
since April, while the index for investment goods production has
grown 18.4 percent.</P>
      <P>This data, together with booming foreign trade, shows that
domestic investment in the second quarter is reviving as the country
meets the rising export demand.</P>
      <P>The DGBAS predicted in May that the domestic investment growth
rate for the second quarter would be 1.1 percent, but this figure
will further increase, as fixed investment is expected to surpass

    <HEADLINE>RAPE AND MURDER SCANDAL SHAMES ARMED FORCES: DEFENSE HEAD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 26 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The rape and murder of a Taipei schoolgirl
by an army private has tarnished the image of the armed forces,
making the military ashamed to face their fellow countrymen, said
Tang Fei, minister of national defense, on Saturday.</P>
      <P>In an urgent meeting organized to discuss ways to tighten
military discipline, Tang said that the scandal has undone the
military's efforts to earn the respect of the public by protecting
the county and its people.</P>
      <P>The meeting was called after a girl was raped and murdered by a
soldier at the Military Historical Museum in Taipei on June 19.</P>
      <P>The soldier, a private assigned to the museum as a handyman,
lured the girl into the office of the curator when no one was around
and strangled her to death during an attempted sexual assault.</P>
      <P>The incident has caused a public uproar, as the museum is within
a maximum-security complex that includes the Ministry of National
Defense and the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>Since the murder the military has been strongly criticized by the
media for its lax discipline.</P>
      <P>Tang told a group of top military officials at the meeting that
although he personally conveyed his apologies and sympathies to the
girl's family on Friday, there is no way to compensate them for their
loss.</P>
      <P>The minister has also extended his apologies and sympathies to
the girl's classmates and the principal of the school she attended.</P>
      <P>Noting that the military is supposed to protect the people, and
that military barracks are supposed to be a safe place, Tang said he
regretted that a man in uniform did the opposite by assaulting a
civilian in the office of a military agency, adding that the man's
actions have made barracks a dangerous place in the eyes of the
people.</P>
      <P>It is an axiom beyond dispute that the military's combat
capability depends much on its discipline, Tang said, noting that the
scandal has exposed a lapse of morals and a type of mismanagement
that will undoubtedly undermine the troop's combat effectiveness. He
urged military leaders to search for and close all loopholes in
regard to military discipline.</P>
      <P>Echoing Tang's remarks that the scandal has tarnished the
military's image, Gen. Tang Yiau-min, chief of general staff,
outlined at the meeting a plan to improve discipline.</P>
      <P>In addition to bringing those responsible for the murder to
justice, Gen. Tang Yiau-min ordered a stepping up of legal education
in the armed forces. He asked that the girl's murder be used as an
example to teach military personnel ways of preventing such an event
from happening in the future.</P>
      <P>The campaign should be targeted at those who are assigned as
handymen to non-combat units, said Gen. Tang Yiau-min.</P>
      <P>The units that provide such men should vouch for their good
conduct and be held responsible for their wrongdoings, he said.</P>
      <P>The main jobs of soldiers are combat and training. Any non-combat
assignments to soldiers should conform to their skill and talents, he
said.</P>
      <P>He also ordered the establishment of a strict conduct code
between male and female military personnel to protect the many women
in Taiwan's armed forces.</P>
      <P>To mete out administrative punishment more quickly, he called for
revisions of military rules to allow authorities to take quick
disciplinary action without becoming bogged down in time-consuming
legal procedures.</P>
      <P>He urged military commanders of various levels to take
responsibility for the wrongdoings of their subordinates.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CABINET HAILS KAOHSIUNG'S DECISION TO SUSPEND LOTTERY LAUNCH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  26  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet on Saturday hailed Kaohsiung
Mayor Frank Hsieh's decision to suspend the planned July 1 launch of
the second issue of the Kaohsiung City Government's welfare lottery.</P>
      <P>"It's a right and wise decision," government spokesman Chen
Chien-jen said, adding that the Cabinet fully supports Hsieh's
decision and is willing to communicate with the city government over
the lottery issue.</P>
      <P>If necessary, Chen said, the Cabinet will assist the Kaohsiung
City Government in resolving issues resulting from the suspension of
the planned lottery launch, such as compensation for losses incurred
by lottery distributors.</P>
      <P>Noting that both central and local-level governments are
obligated to serve the people, Chen said the Cabinet hopes to join
forces with all city and county governments to help underprivileged
groups improve their living conditions.</P>
      <P>Finance Minister Paul Chiu also expressed welcome to Hsieh's
decision, saying it is good news and a good policy.</P>
      <P>Chiu said he understands that Hsieh's decision to issue the
welfare lottery was aimed at helping disabled people earn a living.
"If the welfare lottery is issued by the central government and sold
around the island, more handicapped persons and members of other
underprivileged groups will benefit from the lottery and our society
will also become more harmonious," he noted.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the Ministry of Finance will withdraw its
complaint against the Kaohsiung City Government over the lottery
issue, Chiu said it's up to judicial authorities to decide how to
handle the issue.</P>
      <P>The ministry filed a complaint with the Kaohsiung District
Prosecutor's Office after the city government issued its first
welfare lottery on an experimental basis on June 14.</P>
      <P>Hsieh, a heavyweight from the main opposition Democratic
Progressive Party, announced on Saturday that the Kaohsiung City
Government will postpone the launch of the formal version of its
welfare lottery because there are no channels for the lottery
tickets, printed overseas, to enter Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The mayor of the southern Taiwan port city originally planned to
formally launch the lottery on July 1.</P>
      <P>Hsieh reiterated the city government's determination to hold the
lottery, saying the lottery will be launched "as soon as the tickets
arrive."</P>
      <P>The resourceful lawyer-turned-politician said he is willing to
further discuss the lottery issue with the central government.
Nevertheless, Hsieh said he does not rule out the possibility of
printing lottery tickets in Taiwan to facilitate its launch if the
Ministry of Finance fails to make a positive response to his
goodwill gesture.</P>
      <P>The Kaohsiung City Government's kept secret the location where
the lottery tickets are being printed but has admitted that it is
outside Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The Finance Ministry alerted customs offices at Kaohsiung's
airport and harbor to prevent the tickets from reaching the city
government's building.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said the city government originally planned to issue 5
million lottery tickets on July 1. "As a government agency, the city
government cannot smuggle the tickets into Taiwan. Therefore, we
have to suspend holding of the lottery," he explained.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said he will discuss with Finance Ministry officials
issues related to the welfare lottery. "I hope the central
government will raise the ratio of lottery earnings to local-level
governments and that the central government-run nationwide lottery
can be formally launched either in august or September," he added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Vice Finance Minister Yen Ching-chang said on
Saturday that the ministry will invite officials from the Ministry
of the Interior and other relevant government agencies, as well as
lottery distributors, and representatives of aboriginal groups and
disabled people to a meeting on June 29 to discuss the
ministry's upcoming lottery program.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Vincent Siew praised Formosa
Plastics Group (FPG) for completing 80 percent of its difficult and
complicated sixth naphtha cracker in the central Taiwan town of
Mailiao within six years, sources reported on Saturday.</P>
      <P>FPC's construction has not only fueled Taiwan's economic growth,
but the company's entrepreneurial and business management has also
created an excellent example for Taiwan, Siew said.</P>
      <P>Siew made the remarks when he visited the plants with other
Cabinet members.</P>
      <P>Siew promoted the project to build the industrial complex nine
years ago, at which time he was economic affairs minister, he said,
adding that it is hard to believe the construction has proceeded so
smoothly, considering that it is the first such plant to be built
locally and that there were few government regulations related to the
plant's construction for FPG to turn to for guidance.</P>
      <P>Siew said the petrochemical complex is significant not just for
its size but for how FPG strove to accomplish its construction,
adding that it illustrates the abundant vigor and determination of
Taiwan's private sector.</P>
      <P>Siew later toured the complex's facilities and an adjoining
harbor with Wang Yung-ching and his brother Wang Yung-tsai, chairman
and general manager, respectively, of FPG.</P>
      <P>The sixth naphtha cracking plant, whose construction was the
largest investment project ever undertaken by the private sector,
cost NT$400 billion (US$12.3 billion) to build and occupies 2,600
hectares of land, including 2,134 hectares of reclaimed land.</P>
      <P>In addition to 47 refineries and naphtha cracking plants,
buildings, dormitories, a hospital and recreation centers, the plant
also includes an industrial harbor 24 kilometers deep. The deepest
such harbor in Taiwan, it can accommodate ships of up to 260,000
tons.</P>
      <P>The complex is expected to produce 21 million tons of crude oil,
3.84 million tons of light oil and 1.5 million tons of ethylene. An
estimated business of NT$1 trillion will be generated for middle and
downstream industries.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  26  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The first private power plant to use
natural gas to generate power was inaugurated in northern Taiwan on
Saturday.</P>
      <P>President Lee Teng-hui and Yang Tien-sheng, chairman of the Ever
Fortune Group, presided over the inauguration ceremony of Ever Power
IPP in Taoyuan County's Luchu township.</P>
      <P>The plant, which sits on a plot of about 10 hectares, is a joint
venture by Ever Fortune Industries, Japan's Marubeni, Chiao Tung Bank
and others. It is estimated that the total amount spent on the
plant's construction was NT$20 billion (US$615 million).</P>
      <P>When the president pushed a button to signal the inauguration of
the plant, a resulting spark set fire to a floral decoration near the
stage. The fire was quickly put out.</P>
      <P>President Lee noted that the plant's inauguration marks a
milestone in the liberalization of Taiwan's power industry, adding
that he hoped that the government and the private sector can work
together to boost the nation's power supply.</P>
      <P>Lee said that with rising demands for electricity and a growing
trend of power industry liberalization, the government will continue
to push for the private sector to participate in the construction of
power plants.</P>
      <P>Since the Ministry of Economic Affairs allowed the private sector
to become power suppliers, Ever Power has been the first power plant
to use natural gas to generate power.</P>
      <P>Economics Minister Wang Chih-kang, speaking on the same occasion,
said that power needs in Taoyuan County total 2.5 billion watts, but
there are only two power plants in the county. Together they can
supply only 7 percent of the county's power needs, which means plants
outside the county must provide the rest.</P>
      <P>He said that Ever Power, which can generate 900 million watts of
power, will help relieve the power shortage.</P>
      <P>Taoyuan County Magistrate Annette Lu expressed her appreciation
for the Ever Fortune Group's decision to build the facility in Luchu,
saying that the construction of the plant will help develop the
surrounding area.</P>
      <P>Ever Power officials also announced plans to work with the
Taoyuan County government to promote local prosperity and to help
improve the living quality of the local community through leisure,
cultural and other activities.</P>
      <P>Also attending the inauguration ceremony were Legislative Yuan
President Wang Jin-pyng, National Assembly Speaker Su Nan-cheng and
other government and business leaders.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of 101
illegal mainland Chinese immigrants were repatriated on Satuday from
a detention center in the northeastern coastal county of Ilan.</P>
      <P>As eight illegal mainland immigrants allegedly held hostage two
police officers at the Ilan detention center last week, the
detention center exercised extreme caution in handling the
repatriation work.</P>
      <P>All illegal mainland immigrants were subject to body searches
and their luggages were also carefully inspected. Some dangerous
contraband items were uncovered through extensive searches and
inspections.</P>
      <P>Following Saturday's repatriation, the Ilan center still has more
than 200 illegal mainland immigrants waiting for repatriation.</P>
      <P>The eight illegal mainland immigrants allegedly involved in the
"hostage drama" have been taken into custody by the Ilan District
Prosecutor's Office for further questioning.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Hsinchu detention center in northern Taiwan also
repatriated a batch of about 100 illegal mainland immigrants on
Saturday.</P>
      <P>Last week, a group of illegal mainland immigrants held on
Taiwan's offshore frontline island of Matsu were also repatriated.</P>
      <P>Because of mainland China's reluctance to take back illegal
mainland immigrants, seized mainland stowaways usually have to wait
for several months or even several years before they can be
repatriated.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has spent a large amount of money taking care of
seized illegal mainland immigrants since it opened doors to civilian
exchanges across the Taiwan Strait in the late 1980s.</P>

      <P>The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC)
presented a flag to the 44 children from all over Taiwan, known as
"the angels of peace", prior to their departure for mainland China on
July 10.</P>
      <P>The unique cross-strait exchange visit is in its eighth year. The

former Ministry of Education (MOE) Elementary Education Director San
Hsiao-lin.</P>
      <P>The "angels of peace" will meet local children from Yunnan and
Beijing. Their mission is to introduce popular Taiwan dances, songs

      <P>Since mainland China and Taiwan have been separated for 50 years,
Chao said, a sense of estrangement has arisen between the people.
Through private exchanges and reciprocal visits, misunderstandings

    <TEXT>
      <P>The first laboratory in the Republic of
China that can read the data contained in an air craft's black box
will be officially inaugurated next month, the Aviation Safety
Council (ASC) under the Executive Yuan said on Sunday.</P>
      <P>The reading of data in black boxes containing flight data
information and voice recordings of the cockpit crew is considered
essential in determining the cause of an aircraft crash.</P>
      <P>In the past, the ROC has sent black boxes overseas for reading,
resulting in a delay of the investigative work into the flight's
crash. Language barriers also compromised accurate readings of
cockpit voice recorders.</P>
      <P>The ASC has tried to step up its ability to determine the cause
of flight incidents since it opened in May of last year. It solicited
the assistance of plane crash investigative organizations in the
United States, Canada, and Australia to set up a laboratory that
meets international standards.</P>
      <P>Jung Kai, managing director of the Aviation Safety Council, said
the laboratory will be completed at the end of this month. Testing of
the facility will occur in July with the formal inauguration by the
end of July.</P>
      <P>Jung said that in the future, except for aged flight
recorders or flight recorders from Russian-made planes, around 90
percent of the black boxes on ROC aircraft can be read in the

he is presently a member of the ruling Kuomintang (KMT), he hopes
that he won't be without a party in the future.</P>
      <P>Soong made the remarks during his congratulatory speech at Lee's

the Government Information Office.</P>
      <P>Soong said during his recent contact with the public he realized

the present condition requires a "good man," and he is ready to
"fight for the public" in the near future.</P>
      <P>In response to proposals that he form a "Soong-Lee" ticket for

    <HEADLINE>DETERIORATED US-PRC TIES HARMFUL TO TAIWAN: AIT CHAIRMAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  June  26  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Washington-Beijing engagement is
not a zero-sum game, and Taiwan's own position becomes more tenuous
when US-PRC relations deteriorate, according to the top American
liaison official with the Republic of China on Saturday.</P>
      <P>Richard Bush, chairman and managing director of the American
Institute in Taiwan (AIT), said in a speech on Saturday that the ROC
should be realistic concerning the triangular relationship between
Taiwan, mainland China and the United States.</P>
      <P>In his speech delivered at the annual conference of the Taiwan
Chamber of Commerce of North America, Bush said Taiwan does not live
in a completely peaceful neighborhood and cannot afford not to be
prepared for the worst. He promised, though, the United States will
help the ROC prepare.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan need not act in a way that excites the worst fears and
misperceptions of the other side. Instead it should strive for the
best and work to bring it about," he noted.</P>
      <P>Indeed, Taiwan has already contributed to economic growth and
social welfare on the Chinese mainland, and it serves as a good
example of democracy in action, Bush added.</P>
      <P>"With creativity and political will, it can foster a more
peaceful neighborhood, assuming that the other side is equally
creative and forthcoming," Bush continued.</P>
      <P>Bush used the speech to give a detailed explanation of the
American stance on the so-called "interim agreements" offered by US
Assistant Secretary of State Stanley Roth in March to Taiwan and
mainland China.</P>
      <P>Roth's plan has the two sides signing agreements on some
difficult topics in order to maintain momentum to the long pursuit of
peace through dialogue.</P>
      <P>Bush said some people fear that maybe Roth had a specific type of
agreement in mind; that the United States in effect was imposing such
an agreement, and that such an agreement would be bad for Taiwan.
Bush stated he thinks these people are over-reacting.</P>
      <P>Bush said Roth's "interim agreements" referred to agreements that
offer less than an ultimate resolution, are less than comprehensive,
not total.</P>
      <P>But he (Roth) also had in mind agreements that are objectively
achievable, that are meaningful, and that lead to a significant
reduction in tensions, Bush noted.</P>
      <P>"We agree that a total solution to the Taiwan Strait issue won't
occur overnight. But even without a full agreement, would not the
people of Taiwan be served by agreements that are possible and which
reduce tensions, expand cooperation, and build mutual trust?" Bush
said.</P>
      <P>He emphasized that it is not for the United States to suggest or
dictate a substantive solution to the Taiwan Strait issue. "And
indeed, Mr. Roth made clear that it was the two sides themselves, and
not the United States, that should reach these agreements, because
the sides are the ones who can craft specific solutions which balance
their interests while addressing their most pressing concerns," he
added.</P>
      <P>The key word in Roth's statement, and the word that should have
received the most attention, was "creativity," Bush said.</P>
      <P>The situation in the Taiwan Strait is more stable than it was
three years ago, but it is still not stable -- and that is not in
anyone's interest, Bush continued.</P>
      <P>"We hope that both sides will demonstrate the creativity to find
ways to foster more stability and less tension and to take advantage
of the opportunities for cooperation," he stressed.</P>
      <P>Bush encouraged Taiwan to approach that effort with a sense of
confidence. "In part because it knows that the United States shares
those objectives," he said.</P>
      <P>Bush said some may ask, "How can Taiwan show confidence and
creativity when the PRC is deploying ballistic missiles targeted on
Taiwan?" That is a very good question, he said.</P>
      <P>"The first answer I would offer is the statement that Secretary
of State Albright made in Beijing in March, when she urged the PRC to
consider the reactions to its missile deployments and to exercise
restraint in these deployments.</P>
      <P>"Secretary Albright said, "instead of worrying about a decision
that has not been made to deploy defensive technologies that do not
yet exist, China should focus its energies on the real source of the
problem -- the proliferation of missiles...Nothing would better serve
China's interest than using its developing dialogue with Taiwan to
build mutual confidence and reduce the perceived need for missiles or
missile defense."</P>
      <P>"My second answer is that future US decisions on whether to
provide Taiwan with TMD, which does not yet exist, will be guided by
the Taiwan Relations Act and considerations related to Taiwan's
security. The US government has certainly not precluded Taiwan from
receiving TMD," he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DETERIORATED US-PRC TIES (II)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  June  26  (CNA)
(By Jay Chen and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>So people on Taiwan should not only be confident about their
achievements but also be confident about the role and long-standing
policy of the United States, Bush said, adding that Washington
believes that Taipei and Beijing possess the creativity to resolve
the problems between themselves, and will continue to encourage them
to do so. But America will not impose a solution of its own.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Bush said he believes that people on Taiwan have
nothing to fear from United States' approach to cross-strait
relations, which is part of Washington's one-China policy. That
approach, he said, consists of five principles:</P>
      <P>* The United States insists that the Taiwan Strait issue be
resolved peacefully.</P>
      <P>* The (US) Administration believes that constructive and
meaningful dialogue and cross-Strait exchanges are the best way to
resolve cross-Strait differences.</P>
      <P>* Differences should be resolved by the two sides themselves.</P>
      <P>* The United States will remain even-handed in its approach to
cross-Strait dialogue, and will not apply pressure to either side.</P>
      <P>* The Administration believes that any arrangements concluded
between Beijing and Taipei should be on a mutually acceptable basis.
And because Taiwan is a democratic system, it is the Taiwan public
that ultimately must approve any such arrangements.</P>
      <P>Bush said there is no doubt that those who speculate that perhaps
the crisis in US-PRC relations, triggered by the bombing of the
Chinese Embassy in Belgrade on May 7 by US planes, represents an
opportunity for the PRC to press for concessions from the United
States on issues such as Taiwan, WTO, human rights, Tibet, and
non-proliferation.</P>
      <P>"These speculations are mistaken," Bush said. "US policy in these
areas is determined by clear and long-standing assessments of US
national interests and fundamental values. Our fundamental interests
will not change in reaction to either the bombing error in Belgrade
or the Chinese reaction to it," he stressed.</P>
      <P>Over the long term, he said, the United States' long-term
strategy toward the PRC must be, as President Clinton said in April,
"to encourage the right kind of development in China -- to help China
grow at home into a strong, prosperous and open society, coming
together, not falling apart; to integrate China into institutions
that promote global norms on proliferation, trade, the environment,
and human rights."</P>
      <P>"We of course do not know how the PRC will evolve in the next
century. We can neither assume that it will be a constructive player
nor that it will be a disruptive spoiler. So we need realism and
balance. As President Clinton has stressed, "I believe we have to
work for the best, but do it in a way that will never leave us
unprepared in the event that our efforts do not succeed."</P>

      <P>Former mainland Chinese table tennis
champion Di Chianghwa Saturday visited Kinmen island to impart her
winning techniques to more than two hundred coaches and players.</P>
      <P>Di, along with her two star pupils Zhou Dungyu and Chen Kaichi,

Kinmen at the invitation of the county's table tennis promotion
committee.</P>
      <P>Ti won the national women's singles championship in 1964 and is a
former coach of mainland's national table tennis team. In her
analysis of the techniques, she emphasized spirit, stamina and
technique are the three keys to winning.</P>
      <P>Most people think that long and tedious practices lead to
success, she said. However, she emphasized that brains are needed as
well, and "practicing with skill" is the key to championship.</P>
      <P>Committee official Yang Shih-ta pointed out that table tennis is
the second most popular sport in Kinmen. While the young players are
all eager to learn, he said, they lack proper training information.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SEF'S JAN HOPES TO SET WANG AGENDA DURING BEIJING VISIT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Beijing,  June  27  (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A high-profile delegation from Taiwan
arrived in Beijing on Sunday for talks concerning Wang Daohan's fall
visit to Taipei.</P>
      <P>Jan Jyh-horng, deputy secretary-general of the Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF), the head of the delegation, said in Taipei prior to
his departure that he was given full authority to discuss with
mainland officials all aspects of Wang's itinerary. Wang is mainland
China's top negotiator to Taiwan, chairman of the Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS).</P>
      <P>Jan said following his arrival that he will take a working dinner
with his mainland counterpart, ARATS Deputy Secretary-General Li
Yafei, to discuss the agenda of their formal talks on Monday.</P>
      <P>He and the mission will fly back to Taipei on Tuesday, Jan said.</P>
      <P>Jan noted that his Monday talks with Li will also focus on issues
concerning rights and interests of the peoples on the two sides, such
as the repatriation of hijackers, and illegal mainland immigrants who
are often kept at stowaway detention centers for four to five months
due to Beijing's reluctance to take them back.</P>
      <P>The SEF official said he hopes his Beijing visit will produce
fruitful results that not only decide Wang's Taiwan agenda, but also
prompt the mainland to follow a cross-strait agreement in 1993 that
the two sides conduct dialogue every three months.</P>
      <P>The mainland side has never carried out the agreement, Jan said.</P>
      <P>Both SEF and ARATS show strong desires to confirm the exact date
of Wang's Taiwan trip as the approach of the upcoming Jan-Li meeting,
local observers disclosed.</P>
      <P>Jan's delegation is made up of senior executives who have been
involved in past cross-Taiwan Strait negotiations in the repatriation
of hijackers and illegal immigrants, including SEF Director of Legal
Services Hsieh Fu-yuan.</P>
      <P>Li's team is said to be comprised of Zhou Ning who is in charge
of ARATS negotiations with Taiwan, as well as Ma Xiaoguang and Xu
Shangding, two ARATS deputy directors from the Research Department.</P>
      <P>Jan and Li have not carried out via-s-via talks since March 18,
when the two met in Taipei in the hope of drawing out a concrete
itinerary of Wang's visit to Taiwan. That meeting only resulted in an
idea that autumn is a proper time for Wang and his wife to tour the
island for five or six days.</P>
      <P>The two sides have been failed continually since to confirm an
exact schedule or visit itinerary.</P>
      <P>SEF and ARATS are quasi-official intermediary bodies established
by their respective governments to handle cross-strait exchanges in
the absence of official ties.</P>

      <P>Former spokesman for the Taiwan Provincial
Government Chin Chin-sheng Sunday said Kuomintang (KMT) Secretary
General John Chang's recent announcement that he will meet former
Taiwan Governor James Soong is "empty talk."</P>
      <P>After Soong's recent attack on high-ranking KMT officials, Chang
said on Thursday that he will arrange a meeting with Soong as soon as
possible to discuss his views on the upcoming presidential election.</P>
      <P>Chang has said the meeting will force the KMT to have "important
contact" with Soong, and that the ruling party will assume a low-key
attitude in its dialogue with Soong in order to avoid conflict.</P>
      <P>Chin said that Chang since March has stated his intention to meet
with the former governor, but has never followed through.</P>
      <P>Chang's recent announcement was simply "empty words" that have no

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Chung-shan Institute of Science and
Technology (CIST) unveiled an unmanned strategic aircraft during its
30th anniversary celebration on Sunday.</P>
      <P>Vice President Lien Chan, speaking at the CIST celebration, said
that the development of the unmanned aviation vehicle (UAV) was made
possible through the institute's past experience in designing
high-performance trainer and fighter planes.</P>
      <P>Lien noted that the unmanned aircraft will be able to conduct
reconnaissance operations round the clock, monitor war zones and
locate targets. He added the UAV will help reduce unnecessary deaths
and cut costs.</P>
      <P>The information collected by the plane could be sent back to
ground control stations and command posts enhancing combat
capability, said Lien.</P>
      <P>The aircraft could also be used for research by the fishing
industry and to collect information on ocean pollution and weather
trends.</P>
      <P>In light of lax coastal control due to a shortage of manpower,
the aircraft could also be used to patrol coastal lines, monitor
smuggling activities, illegal immigration and drug trafficking.</P>
      <P>Lien hailed the CIST's performance over the past three decades,
saying that because of its research and development of indigenous
weaponry systems, the military has been able to upgrade its
capabilities in anti-air, anti-sea, anti-landing and electronic
warfare.</P>
      <P>The CIST also developed the Indigenous Defense Fighter (IDF),
land-to-air and air-to-air missiles. Lien encouraged the CIST to
continue to develop products that can be used by both the military and
civilian sectors of the country.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SMALL- AND MEDIUM-SIZED ENTERPRISES FAVOR DOWNSIZED NATIONAL ASSEMBLY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  27  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Most small- and medium-sized enterprises
want a downsized National Assembly and are opposed to an expansion of
its powers, a survey showed on Sunday.</P>
      <P>The survey, conducted by Legislator Lai Shih-pao of the
opposition New Party, found that small- and medium-sized enterprises
responded negatively to the possible expansion of the National
Assembly's power.</P>
      <P>Up to 75 percent of the polled also said that they feel uneasy
about the prospect of constitutional reforms, and that they are
against the National Assembly being integrated into a bicameral
parliament with the legislature as its lower chamber.</P>
      <P>About 40 percent of the enterprises expressed steep opposition
to the expansion of the National Assembly's powers.</P>
      <P>Half of the survey said that they wanted the National Assembly to
be abolished. Half also said that they want to keep it under certain
conditions. Among them, 22 percent said that the National Assembly
should be marginalized and devoted entirely to the constitutional
reforms. Currently, the National Assembly performs ceremonial
functions such as the confirmation of president's appointment of
grand justices.</P>
      <P>Lai noted that the National Assembly in the 1990's revised the
constitutional four times. Most significantly, in 1994, when it stripped
itself of the right to elect the president, laying the groundwork for
the first popular presidential election two years later.</P>
      <P>But Lai said that after four constitutional reforms and repeated
attempts to reform itself, the National Assembly has actually
turned away from the will of the people.</P>
      <P>Lai said while it would be difficult to abolish the National
Assembly in one stroke, it should be downsized to a body of between
100 and 200 deputies from the current 334 deputies.</P>
      <P>A downsized National Assembly should exclusively handle
constitutional reforms so as to be closer to the will of the
people and political reality, Lai said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LIEN FOR THE FIRST TIME LEADS CHEN IN POLL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 27 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China (ROC) Vice President Lien
Chan in a recent poll for the first time gained more support than
opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) presidential hopeful
Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>In its most recent poll, the National Will Survey and Research
Center found that 28.9 percent of eligible voters will cast their
votes for former Taiwan Governor James Soong in the event Soong,
Lien, Chen and former DPP Chairman Hsu Hsin-liang all enter the
presidential race.</P>
      <P>Lien gathered 20.4 percent of the respondents' vote, while 17.6
percent selected Chen. However, 29.3 percent either refused to answer
the question or said they are still undecided.</P>
      <P>If only Lien and Chen are vying for the presidency, 28.8 percent
of the respondents said they will vote for Lien, while 24.3 percent
said they will elect Chen. A stunning 37.4 percent refused to answer
or said they were decided.</P>
      <P>When the race involves four candidates, 41 percent said they
believe Lien will be elected president, while 19.3 percent predicted
Soong will win the election. Only 7.9 percent believed that Chen will
win the bid. A total of 30.7 percent were undecided.</P>
      <P>The poll found that 80 percent of voters want the candidates to
state their platforms on issues, in contrast to only 9 percent who
want the candidates to highlight their personal charisma.</P>
      <P>Nearly 60 percent do not understand the "supra-party,
all-people's government," espoused by Soong, the poll found. Only 38
percent said they understand the concept.</P>
      <P>About 69 percent said they have only a vague idea about what Chen
Shui-bian's "new middle-of-road" concept means. A smaller 28 percent
said they have a firm grasp of the concept, the poll found.</P>
      <P>The poll of 2,400 eligible voters around the island was conducted
by telephone recently, with an error margin of 2 percent.</P>

    <DATELINE>New  York,  June  26  (CNA)
(By David Wang and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Foreign Affairs
Minister Jason Hu on Saturday applauded the contributions Taiwan
businessmen have made to the country.</P>
      <P>Addressing the opening of the annual conference of the Taiwan
Chamber of Commerce of North America in Chicago, Hu said he hopes the
"customer-oriented and cost-efficient" enterprising spirit espoused
by Taiwan business people would someday also be applied to the ROC
government's political administration.</P>
      <P>A number of ROC officials were guests at the opening dinner of
the annual conference, attended by more than 600 Taiwan business
people who maintain business or industrial operations in North
America.</P>
      <P>Chiao Jen-ho, minister of the ROC Overseas Chinese Affairs
Commission, also saluted the Taiwan businessmen in North America for
their commendable contributions to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chiao said in the past, many people had little confidence in the
Republic of China on Taiwan. Nevertheless, Taiwan has managed to
weather one crises after another, and now stands tall, thanks in part
to the contributions of Taiwan businessmen, he noted.</P>
      <P>Richard Bush, chairman and managing director of the American
Institute in Taiwan, also delivered a speech at the conference.</P>
      <P>Bush clarified the US position toward the ROC in his speech. Bush
said that Washington has no intention of forcing Taiwan and mainland
China to reach "interim agreements", the term US Assistant Secretary
of State Stanley Roth proposed in March as the way to solve difficult
areas in the process of seeking peace across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Bush reiterated the United States' five principles concerning
cross-Strait relations: the US insists that the Taiwan Strait issue
be resolved peacefully; the US believes that constructive and
meaningful dialogue and cross-strait exchanges are the best way to
resolve cross-strait differences; the differences should be resolved
by the two sides themselves; the US will remain even-handed and will
not apply pressure to either side; and any arrangements concluded
between Beijing and Taipei should be on a mutually acceptable basis.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CIER  SUGGESTS  TAIWAN  BUSINESSMEN  EXPAND  INTO SE  ASIA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  27  (CNA)
(By David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China government should
assist domestic manufacturers in expanding into the Southeast Asian
market, Chung-Hua Institution for Economic Research (CIER) said
Sunday.</P>
      <P>CIER made the suggestion in its latest research report on
the Southeast Asian industrial restructuring effort following
the Asian financial turmoil's harmful effect on Taiwan investment
in the region.</P>
      <P>CIER said after the Asian financial turmoil, Southeast Asia
governments proposed various measures to cope with problems facing
them. As a result, the investment climates in Thailand and the
Philippines have turned optimistic, while the investment climate in
Malaysia has soured. The Indonesian situation depends on the result
of its political situation.</P>
      <P>Now the best investment destinations for Taiwan businessmen are
the Philippines and Vietnam, CIER said.</P>
      <P>At present, most Taiwan investments in Southeast Asia are in
export-oriented industries. With the expansion of the region's
market, local sales in the region have increased gradually.</P>
      <P>In the face of increasing competition from mainland Chinese
businessmen in the region, the ROC government should assist Taiwan
businessmen expand into Southeast Asian markets, CIER suggested.</P>
      <P>CIER thought the best strategy currently is for the government to
lower trade barriers between the ROC and Southeast Asian nations in
order to promote exchanges of commodities, information and personnel.</P>
      <P>It suggested the government use the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) forum as a channel to lower regional trade
barriers and to further promote regional industrial divisions of
labor.</P>
      <P>The private academic research institution stressed that the
biggest problem for Taiwan businessmen in Southeast Asia is the
difficulty in obtaining loans due to the shortage of funds, the
increase in bank bankruptcies and the general lowering of banks'
lending abilities after the Asian financial turmoil.</P>
      <P>CIER thought the government should eliminate investment barriers
facing local banks in Southeast Asia. It suggested that the
government urge local banks to merge to increase their competitive
edge and to streamline their overseas operations, especially in
Southeast Asia.</P>

dealing with a few people or many, with great matters or with small,
is never presumptuous and never regards anything as beneath his
notice or as unworthy of serious and careful attention: that is what
is meant by being dignified without being supercilious.</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>FESTIVAL OF AUSTRONESIAN CULTURES OPENS IN TAITUNG</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taitung,  June  28 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Festival of Austronesian Cultures in
Taitung 1999, the first of its kind, opened Sunday in this eastern
Taiwan city with colorful dances and artistic performances by
aborigines from eight countries in the Pacific region.</P>
      <P>Foreign delegates came from Fiji, Guam, Hawaii, Malaysia, New
Zealand, Palau and the Solomon Islands, and were happy to be in
Taitung -- home to six of Taiwan's nine major aboriginal tribes.
Delegates said they were surprised to find that the music, dances,
people and weather here are so similar to those of their own
countries.</P>
      <P>Many of them said they felt like they are returning to their
ancestral homeland.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the opening of the eight-day festival on Sunday,
Taitung County Chief Chen Chien-nien said he is not 100-percent sure
that Taiwan is where New Zealand's Maori originated from, but he is
thrilled to see so many anthropologists, scientists and indigenous
people from the Pacific region gathering here to celebrate the
similarity of indigenous cultures in the region.</P>
      <P>Professor Geoffrey Chambers from Victoria University in
Wellington declared in a research report last year that the ancestors
of New Zealand's Maori and of other Polynesian peoples of the Pacific
region came from mainland China. Taiwan would have been the first
stop in the emigrants' island-hopping -- a process that occurred
centuries or millenniums ago.</P>
      <P>Chambers believes the Maori traveled from Taiwan through the
Philippines and Indonesia to West Polynesia. From there they traveled
to the islands of East Polynesia and, then, southwest, eventually
settling in New Zealand.</P>
      <P>He said in the report that there is an exact living record of
these voyages of colonization preserved in the DNA of the travelers'
modern-day descendants, who are still living in these places along
the route.</P>
      <P>During the opening ceremony, Chen and Lin Chen-chih, Taiwan's top
cultural official and the chairman of the Council for Cultural
Affairs, donned traditional Taiwan tribal outfits to perform a
heaven-and-earth worship ritual under the instruction of a wizard
from the Puyuma tribe.</P>
      <P>Sunday afternoon, renowned Australian archaeologist and
anthropologist Peter Bellwood delivered a keynote speech titled
"5,000 Years of Austronesian History and Cultures," while M. Kedite
of Australia's Queensland University delivered one titled "Retention
of Culture: Isban and Austronesian."</P>
      <P>Monday morning Nancy Pollock from Victoria University said in a
speech that the foods of the Austronesian people are important
evidence of their cultural legacy.</P>
      <P>Food bridges cultures among the Austronesia people, she said.</P>
      <P>Pollock said that in the Austronesian-speaking regions, food is a
symbol of generosity, and the phrase "come to eat" is a universal
greeting throughout the Austronesian-speaking population, which
inhabits the largest geographic area on earth.</P>
      <P>Starchy foods, including rice, taro, tubers and yams, are staple
foods of the Austronesian-speaking population, but they are not
considered "complete meals" unless coupled with fish, meat or coconut
flesh, Pollock said.</P>

      <P>A massive personnel exchange program
involving 15,000 young professionals will be one of 33 proposals to
be presented to mainland Chinese leaders by Japanese Prime Minister
Keizo Obuchi next month, The Hong Kong Standard reported Monday.</P>
      <P>The package intends to lay the foundation for friendly relations
between the two Asian neighbors, the report quoted diplomats as
saying.</P>
      <P>Tokyo will offer to provide most of the funds for the program,
the largest ever to be proposed between the two countries.</P>
      <P>Tokyo diplomats reportedly said that because of friction
concerning Japan's invasion of China during World War II, President
Jiang Zemin's visit to Japan earlier this year failed to achieve its
goal of building a strategic partnership and stable relations for the
next century. As a result, many programs scheduled to boost relations
were sidelined.</P>
      <P>Therefore, Obuchi will put forward a 33-item program to improve
relations with Beijing. The highlight is the exchange of young
professionals over a five-year period.</P>
      <P>According to the report, outstanding young professionals from
various government agencies; educational and academic institutes;
social and cultural institutions; and the industrial, commercial,
banking and financial sectors will join the program to promote better
understanding and cooperation between the two countries.</P>
      <P>"The exchange program would include short-term and long-term
training courses, academic and research cooperation projects among
young professionals," it said.</P>

      <P>Executives from insurance companies in the
Asia-Pacific region gathered in Taipei Monday for the two-day 1999
Strategic Issues Conference.</P>
      <P>The Life Insurance Association of the Republic of China, and LOMA

      <P>Premier Vincent Siew, speaking at the opening of the conference,
noted the steady growth of Taiwan's insurance industry, thanks to
Taiwan's economic development over the past decades.</P>
      <P>Siew said 99.3 percent of Taiwan's population has taken part in
an insurance program, and as of last year insurance
companies in Taiwan had aggregate disposable capital of NT$1.5
trillion (US$46.6 billion), making the island the world's
14th-largest insurance market.</P>
      <P>Siew said that to build up a social security network, Taiwan
began a national health insurance program four years ago. As of the
end of April this year, 20,870,000 people have taken part in the
program. Unemployment insurance program was put into effect in January
this year, while a national annuity program is scheduled to begin in
2000.</P>
      <P>Tasks facing the industry include the regulation of financial
exchanges among insurance and banking groups, the nurturing of
insurance professionals, and ensuring insurance operators' resources

    <HEADLINE>ROC, CANADA SIGN WTO ACCORD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   June  28  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China has finally
signed an agreement with Canada on terms for its entry to the World
Trade Organization (WTO), marking a step forward in its bid to join
the Geneva-based world trade regulatory body.</P>
      <P>The agreement was signed in Auckland, New Zealand on Monday by
ROC Economics Minister Wang Chih-kang and Bob Speller, secretary
of state in charge of parliamentary affairs at Canada's Department
of Foreign Affairs and International Trade, on behalf of their
respective governments, the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan began bilateral consultations with Canada on its WTO
membership bid in May 1994, and the two sides finally came to terms
after 13 rounds of difficult talks over the past five years.</P>
      <P>MOEA officials said Taiwan already finalized bilateral trade
consultations with all the 26 WTO contracting parties which had
expressed intention to hold such talks.</P>
      <P>To date, only Hong Kong has not inked a formal accord with Taiwan
on the island's WTO accession terms, even though the two sides
have completed all related negotiations for some time. Observers
attributed Hong Kong's reluctance to formally sign a WTO pact with
Taiwan to the so-called "Beijing factor."</P>
      <P>Minister Wang is currently in Auckland to attend the annual
trade ministers meeting under the framework of the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum.</P>
      <P>Highlights of the newly signed ROC-Canada WTO agreement are as
follows:</P>
      <P>-- The ROC agreed to the Canadian demand that tariff rates on
314 agricultural and fishery products, including beef and Corona
oil, be lowered; on non-tariff trade barriers, the ROC promised to
either allow imports of selected Canadian products under a
tariff-quota system, lift the import ban immediately after its WTO
entry or fully liberalize its market by the sixth year of its WTO
accession.</P>
      <P>-- The ROC also agreed to cut tariffs on 764 industrial items,
including optical fibers, environmental protection machinery and
equipment, plywood, sporting goods and cellular phone systems.</P>
      <P>-- As for the service industry, the ROC promised to open its
markets for financial, insurance, professional, telecommunications
and transportation services based on the results reached in its
consultations with WTO contracting parties.</P>
      <P>Taiwan applied for WTO membership as an independent customs
territory in January 1990. Economics Minister Wang has said Taiwan
stands a good chance to join the WTO this year.</P>
      <P>However, Beijing has insisted that it should be admitted to the
WTO ahead of Taiwan. In consideration of Beijing's such hegemonic
attitude, Hong Kong, now mainland China's special administrative
region, has been reluctant to ink a formal WTO accord with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Beijing applied to join the WTO in 1986. But it lags far behind
Taiwan in its accession terms-related talks. It remains uncertain
whether both sides of the Taiwan Strait can be simultaneously
admitted to the world trade regulatory body by the turn of the
century.</P>

for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS), have agreed that
ARATS Chairman Wang Daohan will accept a Taiwan invitation to visit
Taiwan either between Sept. 12 and 19 or between Oct. 12 and 19.</P>
      <P>The exact date of the visit will be up to Beijing to decide, said
Jan.</P>
      <P>During Wang's visit, SEF will arrange for Wang to tour the whole
of the island -- from Taipei in the north to Kaohsiung in the south
-- in a bid to help the mainland's top negotiator gain a better
understanding of Taiwan in his first, landmark visit, Jan said.</P>
      <P>Wang is expected to meet with his Taiwan counterpart, SEF
Chairman Koo Chen-fu, for at least two rounds of dialogue, he added.</P>
      <P>Jan, who is currently leading a five-member SEF delegation to
Beijing for negotiations on Wang's forthcoming visit to Taiwan, said
SEF will formally invite ARATS Vice Chairman and Secretary-General
Zhang Jincheng to visit Taiwan in either late August or early
September, for talks with his SEF counterpart, Shi Hwei-yow. The two
will put the finishing touches on plans for Wang's visit.</P>
      <P>Jan said SEF will continue to push for cross-strait talks on
pragmatic issues including fishery disputes and the repatriation of
hijackers and illegal mainland Chinese immigrants. SEF hopes that
during the upcoming meeting between Shi and Zhang, these pressing
issues will be added to the agenda of the Koo-Wang talks.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Jan, Li and their respective parties also agreed on
Monday that prior to Wang's Taiwan visit, SEF and ARATS will
accelerate personnel exchanges between the two intermediary bodies,
beginning with a SEF-sponsored visit by a legal group to the
mainland, and an ARATS-sponsored agricultural group visit from the
mainland to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Since last October SEF has made strenuous efforts to bring Wang
to Taiwan, as Taiwan attaches great importance to this visit. But the
visit is expected to be mainly symbolic, as cross-Taiwan Strait
relations have been at an impasse for over 50 years, Jan noted.</P>
      <P>Wang's Taiwan counterpart, Koo Chen-fu, visited mainland China
last October for an ice-breaking meeting with Beijing authorities.</P>
      <P>Koo and Wang first met in Singapore in 1993 in the first and only
high-level meeting between Taiwan and mainland China in 50 years.
During the meeting, the two sides established a formula for regular
SEF-ARATS gatherings.</P>
      <P>The Koo-Wang talks, however, have since been unilaterally
suspended by Beijing after the regime there accused President Lee
Teng-hui of using his visit to the United States in May 1995 to
promote Taiwan independence.</P>

    <HEADLINE>JASON HU RULES OUT VICE PRESIDENTIAL BID</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>San  Francisco,  June  27 (CNA)
(By Amanda Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Foreign Affairs Minister Jason Hu
on Sunday ruled out the possibility of teaming up with Vice President
Lien Chan in Taiwan's 2000 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Hu reportedly made the statement while being questioned by
reporters at the airport.</P>
      <P>Hu arrived in San Francisco from Chicago on Sunday afternoon and
is slated to deliver speeches on Taiwan's role in the periphery of
the Pacific Ocean at a luncheon co-sponsored by two mainstream
political organizations in California.</P>
      <P>According to Taiwan newspapers, Lien has been in contact with
several prospective running mates, including Hu, Premier Vincent Siew
and Wu Poh-hsiung, a senior adviser to the president.</P>
      <P>Hu said that his running with the current vice president was "out
of the question."</P>
      <P>Speaking on Taiwan's US$30 million humanitarian aid package to
Kosovo, Hu said Taiwan's move is highly valued by the international
community.</P>
      <P>Since a concrete plan for helping Kosovo to rehabilitate is still
under evaluation by politically important countries, it is
inappropriate to speculate on whether Taiwan will be permitted to
take part in relief efforts directly, Hu said. He added, however,
that Taiwan would nevertheless cooperate closely with the
international community in the relief mission.</P>
      <P>Taiwan will provide US$10 million during the first year of the
relief program, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will be
responsible for financing the rest of the package with the assistance
of other ministries, Hu added.</P>
      <P>Before heading for San Francisco, Hu attended the annual
conference of the Taiwan Chamber of Commerce of North America in
Chicago. During the meeting, Richard Bush, chairman of the American
Institution in Taiwan delivered a speech on the triangular
relationship between Taiwan, mainland China and the United States.</P>
      <P>Hu told reporters that Bush made it clear that the United States'
stance toward Taiwan will not be affected by any changes in ties
between mainland China and the United States.</P>
      <P>Bush also said Taiwan need not act in a way that excites to the
worst fears and misperceptions of the other side. Hu said he would
not speculate on the meaning of the remark and said it was up to the
United States to explain its meaning.</P>
      <P>"There is no need for Taiwan to change or adjust the direction of
foreign policies," Hu said.</P>
      <P>Bush and Hu exchanged views after Bush's speech, but Hu declined
to name any specific subjects of discussion.</P>

about a series of recent industrial incidents in the park.</P>
      <P>Approximately 12 incidents involving fires and gas explosions in

    <HEADLINE>ROC-HK TIES IMPROVING BUT NO MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH SEEN YET: MAC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  28  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Relations between Taiwan and Hong Kong
have seen positive progress over the past year, but no major
breakthroughs have been achieved yet, the Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC) said on Monday.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet-level council, which charts Taiwan's policy toward
mainland China, made the remarks in an analytical report marking the
second anniversary of Hong Kong's handover from Britain to Beijing
on July 1, 1997.</P>
      <P>Generally speaking, the report said, Hong Kong's situation has
remained stable in the past year. Nevertheless, the report said,
Hong Kong faces fundamental changes and challenges in political,
economic and social fields due to lingering economic recession
caused by a regional financial crisis.</P>
      <P>The report cited several of Hong Kong's current woes, including
a continued economic slowdown, rising unemployment rate, a
Legislative Council-initiated no-confidence vote against senior
Hong Kong government officials and challenges to its judicial
system.</P>
      <P>On Taiwan-Hong Kong ties, the report said the Hong Kong
government is still reluctant to forge official contact or
engagements with Taiwan apparently because of its consideration of
Beijing's attitude.</P>
      <P>For instance, the report said although Hong Kong has finalized
bilateral consultations with Taiwan on terms for the island's entry
to the World Trade Organization, it is unwilling to sign a formal
agreement on the issue.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the report said, no Hong Kong officials have ever
visited Taiwan over the past two years. The Hong Kong government is
too conservative in handling relations with Taiwan now that many
senior mainland Chinese officials have made visits to Taiwan in
recent years, the report said.</P>
      <P>As for mainland China's jurisdiction over Hong Kong, the report
said Beijing has not explicitly interfered with Hong Kong's internal
affairs in order not to cause apprehension among Hong Kong
people nor to affect the international community's confidence in Hong
Kong.</P>
      <P>However, the report said senior Hong Kong officials' habits to
speculate on Beijing's attitude and hinge their policy or measures on
such speculations have undermined the Hong Kong government's ability
to cope with emergencies and may eventually hinder substantiation of
Beijing's promise: "Hong Kong people rule Hong Kong and Hong Kong
maintains high degree of autonomy."</P>
      <P>The report pointed out that the existence of a democratic Taiwan
is conducive to the substantiation of Beijing's "one country, two
systems" formula in Hong Kong and Macau, a Portuguese colony which
will revert to Beijing's rule in December this year.</P>
      <P>Noting that Beijing has let the "one country, two systems"
formula implement in Hong Kong mainly because it wants to set a model
to lure Taiwan to accept the scheme, the report said without
Taiwan's existence, Beijing may not bother to initiate the formula.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, the report said Taiwan is not Hong Kong. "Hong
Kong used to be colony, while the Republic of China has been an
independent sovereign state from the very beginning," the report
stressed, adding that the ROC has diplomatic and self-defense
capabilities which Hong Kong never has.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the ROC's future can only be determined by its
people, the report said there is no timetable for unification of the
two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The report went on to say that the ROC government hopes to see
Hong Kong maintain stability. "We'll also continue promoting
normalization of Taiwan-Hong Kong relations," the report said,
adding that the two sides need an institutionalized framework for
regular consultations and a more convenient mechanism for bilateral
engagements.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN ECONOMIC PROSPECT INDICATORS IN MAY HIT NEW HIGH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  28  (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Both Taiwan's leading composite economic
indicator and its coincident composite economic indicator in May
hit new highs, according to the latest government figures.</P>
      <P>Figures released Monday by the Council for Economic Planning and
Development (CEPD) under the Executive Yuan showed that the leading
composite economic indicator in May surged to 100.1 points, a new
high since May of last year; meanwhile, the coincident composite
economic indicator rebounded to 103.6 points, breaking January 1998's
previous record.</P>
      <P>In addition, May's leading composite indicator showed the third
consecutive month of resurgence, growing 1.3 percent, while the
coincident indicator showed a rise of 1.2 percent, turning the
CEPD-designed five-color composite economic measurement light to
yellow-blue. Yellow-blue represents medium growth.</P>
      <P>The CEPD pointed out in view of the fact that various parts of
the government-designed economic monitoring system generally showed
improvement, the domestic economy is recovering step by step.</P>
      <P>Among the nine indicators used by the CEPD to gauge domestic
economic health, three measurements showed record-high annual growth
for the first time since the outbreak of the Asian financial turmoil.</P>
      <P>The first indicator to have a record high was the M1B money
supply, with 9.2 percent annual growth in May.</P>
      <P>The second indicator is the stock price index which shed
its blue-light indicator for the first time since the Asian financial
meltdown. A blue light represents a low ebb.</P>
      <P>The third indicator is export growth which regained red-light
status for the second time since January, showing Taiwan exports had
attained a very robust performance.</P>
      <P>By and large, observed CEPD officials, in light of improvements
in both economic and financial indicators, the domestic economy has
clearly been in the midst of a recovery since May.</P>

      <P>Tainan County Magistrate Chen Tan-shun has
expressed his support for the Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP)
presidential candidate, making it unlikely that he would agree to be
the running mate of former Taiwan Governor James Soong, DPP chairman
Lin Yi-hsiung said on Monday during a radio interview.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan media recently reported that Soong wants Chen to be his
vice presidential running mate in next year's presidential election.</P>
      <P>Lin replied that the possibility of a "Soong-Chen" ticket is not
"as likely as the public has been conjecturing," since Chen expressed
his full support for the DPP candidate, Chen Shui-bian, on Sunday.</P>
      <P>In addition, Lin said that Chen Tan-shun has never mentioned his
desire to become a vice presidential candidate.</P>
      <P>When answering whether he would meet with Chen personally to
discuss the matter, Lin said that Chen is a seasoned and respected
politician who will not easily change his mind no matter who goes to

      <P>Chen does not need "a pat on his head," he said. Besides, he
added, the DPP's vice presidential candidate will not be decided
until after the party holds its National Congress on July 10 to
officially nominate its presidential candidate.</P>

      <P>More than 10 pre-school children
petitioned for the establishment of a children's affairs bureau
on Monday in the company of dozens of senior executives of human
rights promotional groups.</P>
      <P>The petition, organized by major women's and children's rights
promotional groups, including the Awakening Foundation and the
Children's rights Promotion Association, was staged in front of the
Ministry of the Interior (MOI).</P>
      <P>The child demonstrators sang songs and played games during the
petition to signify their cause, while the adult demonstrators urged
the interior ministry to set up a children's affairs bureau before
September when local schools will re-open for a new semester.</P>
      <P>The demonstrators asked the ministry to clearly define the role
and functions of the children's affairs bureau and launch a
publicity campaign to educate the public the importance of
protecting children's safety and rights.</P>
      <P>They also asked the ministry to open special channels for
rescuing abused children and hold nationwide children's
rights meetings regularly to discuss plights and problems
faced by local children's and their families.</P>
      <P>In addition, the ministry demanded that the ministry draw up a
comprehensive blueprint for protecting children's basic human rights
and improving welfare services for them.</P>
      <P>Children's rights activists said although the country enacted a
children's welfare law in 1973, it has not taken effective measures
to protect local kids safety and rights.</P>
      <P>An amendment to the welfare law adopted in 1993 provided a legal
basis for the interior ministry to set up a children's affairs
bureau, but the Legislative Yuan failed to enact an organic law to
pave the way for the bureau's inauguration until last week.</P>
      <P>"We hope the interior ministry will speed up preparations for
the opening of the children's affairs bureau as soon as possible,"
said an Awakening Foundation executive.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) reported on
Monday that it has detected an additional 120 HIV carriers in Taiwan
between April and June.</P>
      <P>Among the newly discovered HIV carriers, 117 are Republic of
China nationals and three are foreigners. In terms of gender, 107 are
male and 13 female.</P>
      <P>DOH tallies show that two of the three foreign HIV carriers are
laborers and the third one is an ethnic Chinese restaurateur.</P>
      <P>Two of the newly found local carriers were discovered during
police spot checks of "special commercial places" which are often
linked to the sex trade. One of them formerly served as a male
transvestite in the southern port city of Kaohsiung, and the other
was an unlicensed prostitute in the Tainan area.</P>
      <P>DOH officials urged anyone who has engaged in dangerous sexual
activities in the two areas to receive an HIV test at one of the 25
hospitals around the island equipped to provide screening.</P>
      <P>During the three-month period, the DOH also detected seven
married people who have contracted HIV from their spouses. One of
these was a pregnant woman who underwent an abortion after learning
that she had been infected, DOH officials said.</P>
      <P>So far, the DOH has detected a total of 2,379 HIV carriers here,
including 2,139 ROC nationals. DOH tallies also show that 767 of them
have since developed full-blown AIDS.</P>
      <P>Most noteworthy is that of 38 foreign spouses infected with HIV,
37 were foreign brides from places such as mainland China and
Southeast Asia, indicating that the influx of women from these areas
poses a threat to public health and causes social problems, the DOH
officials said.</P>

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The 1999 International Seminar on
Protection of Clean Coasts was held on Monday at the National Sun
Yat-sen University in this southern Taiwan port city.</P>
      <P>The seminar, presided over by Chiu Wen-yen, a maritime
environment and engineering professor at the university, was attended
by more than 100 experts from home and abroad.</P>
      <P>Addressing the seminar, Kaohsiung Mayor Frank Hsieh said that he
places great emphasis on the importance of cleaning up and protecting
Kaohsiung's coasts and maritime ecology, given the city's position as
a major international port and Taiwan's largest harbor.</P>
      <P>Echoing Hsieh's view, Chiu said the protection of marine ecology
and the coastline has become a pressing and critical issue for the
Taiwan authorities, as ecology and natural resources in the island's
coastal areas have undergone major changes as a result of
over-development, leading to deteriorating living environments for
the people of Taiwan in general.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Maritime Cultural Foundation, which sponsored the
seminar, has launched a campaign to promote maritime education among
the public, and has already started coast-cleanup operations around
the island, said Chiu.</P>
      <P>However, he noted that the building of a truly comprehensive
marine ecology protection network requires joint efforts from
experts, social groups, and the government sector.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, W.C. Chan, secretary of Keelung City's Environmental
Protection Bureau, said his northern Taiwan city has made some
progress in marine ecology and coastal protection in recent years,
ever since the bureau and the private sector started working together
on the problem.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, he stressed that it is still necessary to increase
public awareness on the issue. He illustrated his point by citing the
problems caused to the Keelung Port authorities by the large amount
of garbage discarded by the public inside the port area, the island's
second-largest harbor.</P>

on these technical issues, in addition to arranging for a visit to
Taiwan later this year by Wang Daohan, chairman of the Association
for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS).</P>
      <P>Jan Jyh-horng, vice secretary-general of the Taipei-based Straits
Exchange Foundation (SEF) and leader of an SEF delegation, departed
for Beijing on Sunday for the second round of talks this year with
ARATS to set a date for Wang's visit, provisionally slated for this
autumn.</P>
      <P>Besides pushing for Wang's visit, Taipei also hopes to rekindle
bilateral systematic talks on technical issues which were
unilaterally suspended by Beijing in protest against an unofficial
visit to the United States by President Lee Teng-hui in the summer of
1995.</P>
      <P>But prior to Jan's talks on Monday with his ARATS counterpart Li
Yafei, Beijing stressed that it will continue seeking to hold
political talks with Taipei rather than limiting the discussions to
technical issues.</P>
      <P>Later on Monday, it was reported following the first round of
talks that the SEF and ARATS have decided to exchange visits to boost
cross-Taiwan Strait activities, with the SEF promising to organize a
visit to the mainland in August of a delegation of legal
representatives, in exchange for a visit to Taiwan by an ARATS
agricultural mission.</P>
      <P>The SEF and ARATS are semi-official organizations set up by
Taipei and Beijing, respectively, to handle cross-strait exchanges in
the absence of official ties.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING TO ACQUIRE 50 SU-30 JET FIGHTER-BOMBERS FROM RUSSIA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  June 28 (CNA)
(By Herman Pan &amp; Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Beijing has concluded negotiations for
a purchase of 50 Sukhoi-30 jet fighter-bombers from Russia, with
delivery beginning in 2002, according to Monday's edition of the
US-based Defense News weekly.</P>
      <P>Gen. Zhang Wannian, vice chairman of the Central Military
Committee of the Communist Party of China, visited Russia in June and
signed a letter of intent with Russia at that time, the magazine
reported.</P>
      <P>The weekly said that the 50 fighter-bombers, or two squadrons,
with a price of US$37 million apiece, will considerably beef up the
People's Liberation Army's attack capabilities on the ground and at
sea.</P>
      <P>Beijing has already purchased 250 Su-27s, but the newly ordered
Su-30s will be made entirely in Russia instead of being made in
mainland China in a joint venture project, as was the case for 200 of
the 250 Su-27s, said the weekly.</P>
      <P>A military analyst from the Washington-based think tank the
Heritage Foundation described the Su-30 is the Russian equivalent of
the US F-15E jet fighter.</P>
      <P>He predicted that Beijing will equip the planes with airborne
early warning and control systems, an electronic information
gathering system, and anti-radar missiles, as well as advanced
air-to-surface missiles and anti-ship missiles.</P>
      <P>The acquisition of the state-of-art fighter-bombers underlies
Beijing's determination to set up an all-weather attack force which
will have an impact on the security of Taiwan, Japan, and all states
which are in dispute with Beijing over overlapping claims to islands
in the South China Sea.</P>
      <P>A former military attache at the US Embassy in Beijing pointed
out in the weekly that Beijing's procurement of Su-30s is more
significant than its purchase of the Su-27s, in view of the new
plane's accurate attack capabilities against warships, and its edge
over Beijing's indigenous J-7 fighter.</P>
      <P>The weekly said Beijing holds the option to order more Su-30s in
the deal, and will also probably cooperate with Russia to produce the
fighter-bomber in mainland China.</P>
      <P>Also included in the deal was an agreement to produce the KR-1
anti-radar missile, an updated version of the Kh-31p missile, in
mainland China, the weekly quoted a Russian official as saying.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GRAND HOTEL PRESIDENT QUITS FOLLOWING UNION COMPLAINTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 28 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Stanley Yen looks set to resign as general
manager of the Grand Hotel in the wake of complaints from the hotel's
labor union, his aides said on Monday.</P>
      <P>Yen is insistent on carrying through his resignation, saying that
his mission at the hotel is finished, and adding that he hopes his
departure will put an end to the dispute that is poised to further
disgrace the once famous and historic hotel, the aides said.</P>
      <P>Yen chose to leave the hotel, after 16 months spent helping it
regain some of its former glory, when members of the employee union
denounced him openly in local newspapers for "emptying the hotel's
assets and conducting waves of personnel cleaning."</P>
      <P>Yen was defended by the manager of the Grand Hotel's Human
Resources Department Fan Hsi-ping, who said the charges were
groundless, as the hotel's bank account stood at NT$198 million as of
June 30, an amount much higher than 16 months ago.</P>
      <P>Fan said the Grand Hotel staff should in fact "be grateful" to
Yen for the reforms that have won back some of the hotel's former
glory, enticed back prestigious guests, and enabled the Taipei
landmark to show a profit.</P>
      <P>S.L. Chang, director-general of the Tourism Bureau, and a member
of the hotel's board of directors, asked Yen to remain in his post,
pointing out that is not up to the labor union to decide whether Yen
should stay or go.</P>
      <P>"Apparently, the labor union has usurped Chairman Koo Chen-fu's
rights on personnel decision-making and has staged political
infighting, in which Yen has served as a scapegoat," he said.</P>
      <P>The Grand Hotel, the brainchild of Madame Chiang Kai-shek, widow
of the late president of the Republic of China, witnessed its darkest
hour in 1995 when a fire gutted its famed "dragon roof" and upper
stories.</P>
      <P>The hotel, founded in 1952 as a state banquet venue, reached its
business peak in the 1960s when it entertained many government
leaders and celebrities. It was renovated to its present 14-floor
Chinese palatial style in 1970.</P>
      <P>The hotel, renowned as a "modern architectural delight in a
classical Chinese palace style," is now in the hands of a management
team chaired by business tycoon Koo Chen-fu, Taiwan's top negotiator
with mainland China.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SEF URGES MAINLAND CHINA TO SPEED UP REPATRIATION OF ILLEGALS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Beijing, June 28 (CNA)
(By Tseng Chun-liang and Wendy Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Negotiators from Taiwan and mainland China
had a second round of talks on Monday afternoon, following which
Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) issued a statement urging
the mainland to speed up its repatriation process for illegal
immigrants.</P>
      <P>Jan Jyh-horng, deputy secretary-general of Taiwan's
quasi-official SEF is currently leading a five-member SEF delegation
in Beijing for negotiations on a forthcoming visit to Taiwan by
Association of Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) Chairman
Wang Daohan.</P>
      <P>In the talks with his ARATS counterpart Li Yafei, Jan urged the
mainland authorities to abide by the Kinmen Agreement, signed between
the two sides in 1990, which stipulated that mainland China should
take back illegal immigrants to Taiwan within 20 days of their
apprehension.</P>
      <P>The SEF also issued a position paper on the issue, the highlights
of which are as follows:</P>
      <P>-- According to statistics, the Republic of China government has
seized and detained an average of 270 illegal immigrants each month
between 1987 and July 15, 1999, at a cost of over NT$600 million;</P>
      <P>-- Mainland China has used all kinds of excuses to delay the
20-day extradition limit, and each illegal currently spends an
average of 155 days in Taiwan detention centers before returning
home. While over 37,000, have been repatriated, more than 800 remain
in detention, some of whom have waited for between two and six years
to return home;</P>
      <P>-- To alleviate their homesickness, the Mainland Affairs Council
arranges phone calls and family visits for the detainees during
certain national holidays. However, it is the mainland's failure to
keep their side of the Kinmen Agreement which has resulted in the
detainees' misfortune;</P>
      <P>-- People on the mainland use every means to sneak into other
countries, which causes considerable harm to those countries' social
security, and has become an international concern. As a member of the
global community, mainland China is responsible for restricting its
own people's illegal immigration and stepping up border controls; and</P>
      <P>-- The illegal immigrant repatriation issue has been discussed
repeatedly by both sides, but mainland China unilaterally suspended
cross-strait dialogue in June 1995. The SEF hopes to resume
negotiations, but before new agreements are signed, the SEF urges the
mainland to abide by the Kinmen Agreement and let the remaining
illegals return home as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>The numbers of Hong Kong people having
confidence in the future of Hong Kong and in Beijing's "one country
two systems" formula are reducing, according to a report released
on the eve of the second anniversary of the territory's reversion to
Beijing.</P>
      <P>The Social Science Study Center of the University of Hong Kong
said in the report that, according to its various surveys made
during the two years after the territory was handed over to mainland
China on July 1, 1997, nearly 72 percent of Hongkongers said in the
first year that they were confident about Hong Kong's future, but the
average dropped to 61 percent in the second year.</P>
      <P>The surveys also showed that, in the first one and a half years
after the reversion, 65 percent of Hong Kong people had confidence in
Beijing's "one country two systems" formula; the average dropped to
58 percent in the past six months.</P>
      <P>Beijing said before the reversion that it would allow Hong Kong
to govern itself for 50 years according to the so-called "one country

    <HEADLINE>COA ANNOUNCES NEW AGRICULTURAL IMPORT QUOTAS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  28  (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture
(COA) on Monday announced a series of new management methods for the
import of agricultural products, to be implemented once the island
enters the World Trade Organization (WTO).</P>
      <P>The new system will allow the import of 43 types of agricultural
products, some of which will have no restrictions on quantity, while
others will have a tariff rate quota (TRQ) system which levies low
tariffs, mostly at half of the current rates, COA officials said.</P>
      <P>All 43 of the items, one of which is rice, are currently banned
from being imported into Taiwan, or are subject to import
restrictions depending on their origin, in order to protect local
agricultural development. The island's WTO accession obliges it to
open its market under the WTO's free trade principle.</P>
      <P>Rice, the most sensitive item on the list, will still be imported
on a strict quota system after Taiwan joins in the WTO, according to
new system.</P>
      <P>Just 140,000 metric tons of foreign rice, or 8 percent of
Taiwan's total rice consumption between 1990 and 1992, will be
allowed into the country by 2000.</P>
      <P>Twenty-two other products will be imported based on the TRQ
system, including sugar, peanuts, red beans, dried garlic, dried
mushrooms, dried lilies, betel nuts, coconuts, oriental pears,
shaddocks, dried longans, bananas, pineapples, mangoes, persimmons,
fish, pork bellies, chicken meat, and offal.</P>
      <P>The rest, mostly fruit or goods that Taiwan does not produce
itself, will be freed from import restrictions.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  28 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) on
Monday summoned Ambassador David Panama of El Salvador to explain a
serious violation of traffic regulations by an embassy limousine
driven by a local miscreant with a long criminal record.</P>
      <P>MOFA issued the summons in response to news reports that a Taiwan
citizen with 14 criminal convictions drove a BMW limousine bearing
foreign diplomatic license plates on June 24 against the traffic and
ran a red light in central Taiwan's Nantou County.</P>
      <P>Witnesses reported the incident to the police, who in turn
informed MOFA when it was found that the limousine belongs to the El
Salvador embassy.</P>
      <P>MOFA then sent a diplomatic note to the Salvadoran embassy to ask
for an explanation, which it failed to receive, prompting MOFA
officials to summon Panama on Monday to demand a personal
explanation.</P>
      <P>Panama apologized and promised to cooperate fully with MOFA. He
explained that the limousine was originally parked in the embassy's
garage but was driven away by a local driver hired by the embassy. He
pledged that the driver would not be hired again, and that he would
not allow any repeat of such an incident.</P>
      <P>However, MOFA was "very unsatisfied" with Panama's story and
asked him to provide a more detailed explanation.</P>
      <P>MOFA said that in addition to asking the Salvadoran embassy to
provide a more detailed explanation, it will also seek police
assistance in obtaining explanation from both the local driver hired
by the embassy and the convicted felon to whom the embassy driver
apparently lent the car.</P>

    <HEADLINE>HK UNLIKELY TO BE STUMBLING BLOCK IN TAIWAN'S WTO ACCESSION: MOEA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  28  (CNA)
(By Wendy Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Hong Kong has promised not to hinder
Taiwan's entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO), the Board of
Foreign Trade (BOFT) under the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA)
pointed out on Monday.</P>
      <P>With the Republic of China finally inking an agreement with
Canada on Monday on terms for its entry into the WTO, Hong Kong
remains the only member which requested accession negotiations yet to
have signed a formal accord with Taiwan on the island's WTO accession
terms.</P>
      <P>The ROC-Canada bilateral accord was signed in Auckland, New
Zealand during the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum's
annual trade ministers' meeting, making Canada the 25th WTO member
country to have signed a formal agreement with the ROC.</P>
      <P>Although there has been concern that Hong Kong will become an
obstacle in Taiwan's WTO accession due to the so-called "Beijing
factor," the BOFT pointed out that the former British colony has
agreed not to obstruct approval of the ROC working party report which
must be submitted during the WTO's 11th working party meeting at the
end of July, a BOFT spokesman said.</P>
      <P>According to WTO entry regulations, the applicant country must
summarize the results of all bilateral and multilateral consultations
into a working party report and protocol of accession, for approval
through general consensus of the WTO Working Party.</P>
      <P>The WTO General Council will then review the package of accession
documents through a second stage of general consensus. Once the
documents are fully approved, Taiwan's entry will be finalized.</P>
      <P>However, if a member country were to cast an opposing vote,
Taiwan's accession would then have to pass a two-thirds majority vote
of the General Council.</P>
      <P>The MOEA has assessed that the third WTO Ministerial Conference,
which will be held in Seattle at the end of November, would be the
best timing for the ROC's entry, which means that the working party
report and protocol of accession must be approved in the near future.</P>
      <P>Since the ROC applied for WTO accession, it has signed bilateral
accords with South Africa, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Turkey, El
Salvador, Columbia, Uruguay, Chile, South Korea, Australia, Iceland,
Norway, Japan, Malaysia, the Philippines, New Zealand, Singapore, the
United States, Switzerland, Mexico, Hungary, Argentina, the European

    <TEXT>
      <P>Beijing agreed on Monday to Taipei's
suggestion of a visit to Taiwan in September or October by Wang
Daohan, mainland China's top negotiator to the island.</P>
      <P>In a meeting between Jan Jyh-horng, deputy secretary-general of
Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), and his Beijing
counterpart, Li Yafei of the Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Strait (ARATS), Beijing agreed to choose between September
12-19 and October 12-19 for ARATS Chairman Wang's visit, although the
exact date might still be moved ahead or postponed a couple of days.</P>
      <P>They also agreed that Wang's seven-day journey will start in
Taipei and end in Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>Further progress in the one-day meeting was achieved when the two
sides agreed on an exchange of visits by delegations before Wang's
trip, with a delegation for legal affairs from Taiwan visiting the
mainland and an agricultural delegation from the mainland coming to
Taiwan sometime between July and August.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, however, Beijing stonewalled on Taipei's
request to negotiate on issues without political overtones, such as
the repatriation of illegal immigrants and hijackers, and the
settling of fishing disputes, in parallel with talks on Wang's trip.</P>
      <P>Both sides reiterated invitations to the leaders of the two
organizations, with ARATS extending an invitation to SEF
Secretary-General Shi Hwei-yow, and the SEF responding with an
invitation to ARATS Secretary-General Zhang Jincheng. Both invites
were dismissed by the other side.</P>
      <P>At a press conference for Taiwan-based mass media after his
meeting with Li, Jan said he regretted Beijing's reluctance to
restore institutionalized dialogue with Taipei and put the SEF-ARATS
work back on track.</P>
      <P>Beijing's foot-dragging in this field has seriously obstructed
the deportation of illegal mainland immigrants by Taiwan, and has
reduced the impact of the Kinmen accord signed between the two
parties on this issue in 1990, said Jan.</P>
      <P>For his own part, Jan said he rejected a request from Beijing to
co-sponsor a non-governmental forum and make it a platform for both
parties to air their views on bilateral economic, political, or any
other issue.</P>
      <P>He restated Taipei's stance that the SEF and ARATS are
non-government organizations with a special government mandate, and
should focus on bilateral negotiations rather than engage in hosting
a forum with no specific purpose which would have to compete with the
many private organizations already pursuing the same ends.</P>
      <P>SEF Secretary-General Shi Hwei-yow earlier this year branded
Beijing's advocacy of the forum as a plot to throw a "hand grenade"
into Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Shi said ARATS is trying to make the forum a "second channel" for
dialogue, with the ultimate purpose of replacing the contacts between
SEF and ARATS, or at least making it a platform for Beijing
supporters in Taiwan to float their pro-Beijing opinions.</P>
      <P>Jan and his entourage arrived in Beijing on June 27, and will
leave for Taiwan on Tuesday.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CANADA A MODEL FOR THE WORLD: PM CHRETIEN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  June 28 (CNA)
(By S. C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Canada's Prime Minister Jean Chretien said
Monday Canada is a much more egalitarian country than the United
States and should serve as a model for the world.</P>
      <P>In an interview with the Cable Public Affairs Channel, Chretien
said Canada has done a better job than the United States in balancing
administrative responsibilities with social justice.</P>
      <P>"We're very different from the Americans in many ways. We have a
duty to, and a notion of, unity in diversity," Chretien said.</P>
      <P>He added, "The United States tried to envisage that everybody
had the same language and the same skin color, but that didn't
happen ... We're also a country much more egalitarian than the United
States."</P>
      <P>After attending a recent meeting of G-8 leaders in Europe,
Chretien said he had time to reflect on how fortunate Canadians are
to lead a generally peaceful existence.</P>
      <P>"When I go to any international meeting and I listen to my
colleagues and I discuss with them ... when I get back in the plane,
I say 'I'm going back to probably the easiest nation in the world to
run,'" Chretien said. "That does not mean that it's easy, but in
relative terms, it is."</P>
      <P>Chretien said his wish for Canadians this Canada Day would be
that they feel proud of their citizenship. "As a Canadian, when I
compare myself I feel very good. I want Canadians to feel very good
on the first of July 1999."</P>

    <HEADLINE>KANGAROO HEARTS CAN BE USED IN HUMANS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  June  29  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australian scientists have discovered
that aortic valves from kangaroo hearts last much longer in humans
than those from pigs, the present mainstay of valve replacement.</P>
      <P>The Sydney Morning Herald on Tuesday reported that researchers
from Fremantle Hospital of Western Australia said when transplanted
into sheep, the kangaroo valves do not calcify nearly as quickly as
pig valves.</P>
      <P>The kangaroo hearts are abundant, energetic, lean and may become
the epitome of cardiovascular fitness to repair diseased human
hearts, the daily reported.</P>
      <P>The daily quoted Dr. Andrew Hodge as saying that, "The kangaroo
heart valve is almost identical to the shape of its human equivalent.
We also expect it to be more robust than tissue from pigs because of
the kangaroo's more active lifestyle and upright posture."</P>
      <P>He said the results of the initial 10 valve replacements using
kangaroos parts implanted into young sheep two years ago, show almost
no calcification.

    <HEADLINE>SEN. ASHCROFT BLAMES CLINTON ADM. FOR CHINESE SPYING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  June  28  (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>US Sen. John Ashcroft (R-MO) said
Monday that President Bill Clinton and his administration bear major
responsibility for grave American intelligence losses to the People's
Republic of China, thus jeopardizing the national security of the US.</P>
      <P>According to a report in The New York Times on Sunday, former
White House Chief of Staff Leon Panetta was briefed on intelligence
losses to the PRC in July 1995. He then instructed the Central
Intelligence Agency to work with the National Security Council in
conducting its investigation.</P>
      <P>A member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee,
Ashcroft said, "Even if the White House was first briefed on Chinese
espionage in April 1996, senior administration officials took no
substantive steps to stop the loss of critical nuclear secrets until
February 1998, almost two years later."</P>
      <P>"The fact that the White House was briefed on these intelligence
losses almost a year earlier than originally disclosed demonstrates
near-complete incompetence within the National Security Council,"
noted the senator.</P>
      <P>Although the Clinton administration has sought to portray such
intelligence losses as endemic over the last two decades, Rep. Chris
Cox (R-CA), chairman of the select committee which reviewed Chinese
espionage activities, has stated that "Some of the most significant
thefts occurred during the last four years."</P>
      <P>Ashcroft continued that "Passing the buck to earlier presidents
is unacceptable behavior from an administration that has much to
explain in this espionage scandal. The simple truth is that the
(Clinton) administration has jeopardized US national security through
bureaucratic delay, blatant mismanagement, and a desire to engage
Beijing at any cost."</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN  BUSINESSMEN OPTIMISTIC ABOUT MAINLAND INVESTMENTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 29 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Some 64.8 percent of Taiwanese businessmen
with investments in the mainland said a visit by Wang Daohan, the
mainland's top negotiator with Taiwan, will help cross-strait trade
relations, a survey showed on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The survey, conducted by the Chinese National Federation of
Industries (CNFI), also found that 77.5 percent said that trade
issues -- particularly the signing of an investment guarantee
agreement -- should be the top priority in cross-strait talks.</P>
      <P>The survey found general optimism among local investors in the
mainland, as up to 40 percent said they expect to increase their
capital investment during the next year, and nearly 76 percent
predicted they will turn a profit next year.</P>
      <P>Between May 15 and 31 CNFI sent 1,500 questionnaires to Taiwan
businessmen with mainland investments. The CNFI collected 152
effective samples.</P>
      <P>The survey found that 54.2 percent of those polled said that they
made a profit in the mainland this year, while 26.4 percent said they
broke even, and 19.1 percent said they lost money.</P>
      <P>Compared with a similar survey two years ago, more businessmen
reported earning a profit in the new survey and fewer reported
losses.</P>
      <P>The survey showed that local businessmen have confidence in their
investments, as 75.5 percent expect to make a profit next year, an
increase from a similar survey last year.</P>
      <P>Some 17.1 percent of Taiwan businessmen predicted that they would
break even, while only 6.8 percent said that they will have a modest
loss.</P>
      <P>The major problems encountered by Taiwan businessmen include
difficulties in obtaining loans from mainland banks, the extra
expenses required for social activities, the frustration of trying to
pry open mainland markets, and the adjustment problems that newly
arrived executives face.</P>
      <P>Taiwan businessmen also said the type of assistance they most
hope to get from the government is legal counseling, followed by
information on trade in the mainland, and help in obtaining loans
from mainland banks.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SEF REGRETS BEIJING'S RELUCTANCE TO SET DATES FOR WANG'S VISIT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  29  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) on
Tuesday expressed regret over Beijing's reluctance to set definite
dates for top mainland Chinese negotiator Wang Daohan's planned visit
to Taiwan later this year.</P>
      <P>The quasi-official intermediary body made the remarks after its
deputy secretary-general, Jan Jyh-horng, ended a day of intensive
talks in Beijing on Monday aimed at setting the stage for Wang's
landmark visit to this island.</P>
      <P>SEF offered its mainland Chinese counterpart -- the Association
for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) -- a choice of dates
for the trip, Sept. 12-19 or Oct,. 12-19.</P>
      <P>ARATS officials, however, did not make an immediate choice,
saying they would "report back to their leaders" before giving
Taiwan an answer.</P>
      <P>SEF and ARATS are semi-official bodies authorized by their
respective governments to handle cross-strait exchanges in the
absence of official ties.</P>
      <P>Wang's visit would reciprocate a trip to mainland China by SEF
Chairman Koo Chen-fu last October which helped thaw bilateral
relations.</P>
      <P>SEF said even though it is not satisfied with Jan's inconclusive
talks with his ARATS counterpart Li Yafei during his June 27-29
Beijing visit, it will still continue active preparations for Wang's
"get to know Taiwan journey" in line with the principles of "safety,
comfort, sincerity and constructiveness."</P>
      <P>SEF pointed out that Wang's Taiwan visit is of great
significance as Beijing has unilaterally suspended regular SEF-ARATS
dialogue since mid-1995. The suspension has hampered substantiation
of the agreements signed during the first Koo-Wang meeting held in
Singapore in April 1993.</P>
      <P>"We look forward to seeing gradual re-opening of
institutionalized SEF-ARATS communications channels through
continued dialogue," SEF said in a press statement.</P>
      <P>SEF stressed an urgent need to resume systematic consultations
between the two intermediary bodies to resolve some practical issues
related to the rights and interests of people on both sides of the
Taiwan Strait, including fishing disputes, repatriation of mainland
hijackers and illegal mainland immigrants, cross-strait smuggling,
protection of Taiwan business people's physical safety and prevention
of the spread of animal diseases.</P>
      <P>During the just-concluded Jan-Li talks, the two sides agreed to
organize professional groups to exchange visits before Wang's
reciprocal trip to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>SEF said it hopes such exchanges can help boost mutual
understanding and resolve some problems arising from bilateral
exchanges. For instance, mainland visitors have often deliberately
dodged calling at SEF office and relevant Taiwan government
agencies. "We hope increased bilateral exchanges will help
normalize SEF-ARATS and overall cross-strait interchanges," it
added.</P>
      <P>As for the ARATS proposal that the two intermediary bodies
co-sponsor a seminar on the development of cross-strait relations
before Wang's Taiwan visit, SEF said private sectors on both sides
have been active in organizing similar activities. In 1998 alone,
Taiwan's private groups sponsored more than 100 similar seminars.
Against this background, SEF said it does not think that the two
organizations need to bother to organize such kinds of events.</P>
      <P>SEF went on to say that since the two intermediary bodies are
set up to serve the people, they should work together to resolve all
practical problems arising from ever growing cross-strait civilian
exchanges. "We earnestly hope that ARATS will return to the
negotiation table as early as possible to fulfill its obligations
under the agreements signed during the first Koo-Wang meeting," it
added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TRIAL OF COUNCILWOMAN'S ALLEGED MURDERERS TO FINISH IN 45 DAYS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  29  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The trial of four men being charged in
connection with the murder of a Taiwan councilwoman in mainland China
is expected to be completed in 45 days, sources in the opposition
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in Kaohsiung, southern Taiwan,
said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The trial began at Anshan Intermediate People's Court in northern
mainland China at 8 a.m. Monday. The four are being tried in
connection with the murder of Lin Ti-chuan, a Kaohsiung City
councilwoman and a rising star in the DPP.</P>
      <P>Two coroners have been called in to provide testimony, as has
Lin's boyfriend, Wei Tien-kang.</P>
      <P>Lin and Wei went to the mainland in late July last year. Shortly
after they arrived, they were abducted by armed men and repeatedly
injected with an unknown substance. Wei escaped and alerted police,
while Lin died of a drug overdose at a Haicheng area hospital.</P>
      <P>Lin's father Lin Ping-huei, accompanied by a lawyer and a DPP
official, went to the mainland on Saturday to attend the trial. He
has asked the court to determine the truth behind his daughter's
death.</P>
      <P>Noting that Li Guangzhi, the alleged mastermind of the abduction,
was still at large, Lin has also asked the court to impound the
property of Li and his family.</P>
      <P>Lin is also seeking compensation of 44 million renminbi (about
NT$170 million) from the alleged perpetrators of the crime, the
highest amount sought in any case filed across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Although it is unlikely that Lin will receive the full amount he
is seeking, it is hoped that this case will set a precedent for
Taiwan crime victims in the mainland seeking compensation in the
future.</P>
      <P>Lin commemorated his daughter and called on Haicheng City's mayor
after the second day of the trial on Tuesday. He is scheduled to
return to Taiwan on Thursday.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  29  (CNA)
(By Amanda Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's food industry will suffer a
serious hit as member economies of the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) forum Tuesday proposed fully opening markets by
2004, with regional tariffs on foods being lowered to less than 5
percent.</P>
      <P>APEC's previous timetable called for open markets among its
developed members by 2010 and completely free markets among all
members by 2020.</P>
      <P>Trade and commerce ministers and other officials from APEC's 21
member economies gathered on Tuesday in New Zealand for an annual
meeting. During the meeting, a proposal to free up trade in oilseed,
food, rubber, fertilizer, civilian aircraft and automobiles was high
on the agenda.</P>
      <P>The proposal, brought up by Australia and endorsed by the United
States, suggested all member economies establish by 2004 food markets
that are completely free. The liberalization measures would affect
vegetables, fruits, alcohol, beverages and raw materials for food
products.</P>
      <P>In the oilseed sector, APEC proposed total liberalization by 2002
with zero tariffs and all member economies should allow free import
of raw materials for food oil, such as sesame and soybeans, together
with edible oils.</P>
      <P>The average tariffs in Taiwan's food sector is 40 percent, while
many kinds of vegetables are import-restricted items. If the
liberalization were to take place ahead of its original schedule, it
would have a tremendous impact on Taiwan's foodstuff-producing
companies.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs and Council of Agriculture (COA)
both expressed opposition to the proposal.</P>
      <P>Domestic oil-producing firms would not be able to survive, while
the oil-processing industry would lose its competitiveness once
Taiwan agrees to the proposal, said the COA.</P>
      <P>The proposal to advance free trade in the food and oilseed
sectors goes beyond regulations set by the World Trade Organization
(WTO), and Japan, mainland China and South Korea are not likely to
support it, the COA noted. Taiwan will urge APEC members to pass the
issue to the WTO for further discussion.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China President Lee Teng-hui
said the ROC will play an increasingly important role in the world
community in the 21st century, and aiding Kosovar refugees is a
concrete display of Taiwan's participation in global affairs.</P>
      <P>Lee made the remarks during a Monday morning reception for
high-ranking officials from the Taipei Junior Chamber (TJC).</P>
      <P>As Taiwan has developed into a free, democratic and prosperous
country, it will play an even more important role in the
international community in the next century, Lee said.</P>
      <P>Thus, he said, aside from committing itself to domestic
developments, the ROC must actively devote itself to participation in
international affairs and the fulfillment of its international
duties.</P>
      <P>He further pointed out that out of humanitarian concerns, Taiwan
is willing to offer US$300 million to help Kosovar refugees rebuild
their homes, and this act is demonstrative of the ROC's active
participation in world affairs.</P>
      <P>Since the Kosovo peace program has received much support and
attention from most countries in the world, he stressed, the ROC's
participation in the rehabilitation of the Kosovo region is a good
chance for the ROC to join in the global community.</P>
      <P>In regard to national development, Lee raised three issues that
need to be considered: the purpose of national development; the
advantages Taiwan possesses; and the methods to be used to achieve
national development goals.</P>
      <P>Aside from urging the people of Taiwan to reach a general
consensus, Lee also encouraged everyone to observe each problem with
a broad perspective and to work toward the country's long-term
stability and peace.</P>

Confucius' lesson of the day: "A wise and good man has only to
watch over every minute detail connected with his daily life, not
only of conduct and bearing, but even in minor details of dress, so
as to produce an effect upon the public mind, which, without these
influences, could only have been produced by fear."</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>GOVERNMENT TO ADJUST UPWARD TAIWAN'S ECONOMIC GROWTH ESTIMATE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  29 (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The National Income Statistics Assessment
Committee (NISAC) will adjust upward Taiwan's economic growth in
August, noted the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and
Statistics (DGBAS) on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The remark, made by the DGBAS under the Executive Yuan, was a
reflection of the fact that most of the island's important economic
indicators have shown an improved performance for May.</P>
      <P>Figures released Monday by the Council for Economic Planning and
Development (CEPD) under the Executive Yuan showed that the leading
composite economic indicator in May surged to its highest point in a
year; meanwhile, the coincident composite economic indicator in May
also rebounded and hit its highest level since January 1998.</P>
      <P>Chou Chi, head of a branch office of the Chung-Hua Institute for
Economic Research, observed that the recovery of the domestic economy
has been stronger than expected. The Chung-Hua Institute will revise
its domestic economic growth estimate upward to over 5 percent from
the previous 4.97 percent, he added.</P>
      <P>Chen Chang-hsiung, head of DGBAS's Third Bureau, said that in
light of the fact that the island's economic resurgence is
increasingly clear, it is expected that the NISAC, a lower branch of
the DGBAS, in its third meeting in August will adjust Taiwan's annual
economic growth to a higher level.</P>
      <P>K.C. Lee, vice chairman of the CEPD, noted that the island's
annual economic growth will likely reach 5.5 percent, which is the
goal set by the government.</P>
      <P>As to whether the monetary policy of the Central Bank of China
should be kept loose and easy or be tightened, Chou said the current
policy should be maintained and that the bank should not adopt a
tighter monetary policy, at least for the time being.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LIEN-SOONG TICKET IS STILL LIKELY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  29  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Lee Teng-hui has not ruled out
the possibility of Vice President Lien Chan teaming up with former
Taiwan Governor James Soong in the next presidential election,
Tainan County Magistrate Chen Tang-shan said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chen, a heavyweight in the main opposition Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) who met with President Lee on Monday, made
the revelation in an interview in a popular radio talk show.</P>
      <P>The physicist-turned-politician said his meeting with Lee was
set on June 12 when Lee gave a dinner in honor of Chimei Group
Chairman Hsu Wen-lung, a respected tycoon who has constantly called
for a cut in government work force and upgrading of administrative
efficiency. Chen was also present at the dinner.</P>
      <P>During their Monday meeting, Chen, now in his early 60s, said he
had asked Lee about the possibility of a Lien-Soong ticket.</P>
      <P>"It's possible," Lee was quoted as having told Chen. "After a
brief pause, the president further said that anything is possible,"
Chen recalled.</P>
      <P>Chen said he also took advantage of the occasion to clarify
speculation that he may serve as Soong's running mate if Soong
really breaks ranks with the ruling Kuomintang to run in the 2000
presidential race as an independent.</P>
      <P>"I told the president that I has no intention to run for the vice
presidency," Chen said, adding that neither Soong nor his aides
has ever contacted him over the teaming-up issue.</P>
      <P>Asked if he is likely to team up with DPP presidential hopeful
Chen Shui-bian, Chen said if the former Taipei mayor approached him
for the issue, he will carefully consider the offer. "Nevertheless,
my answer is very likely to be negative," he added.</P>
      <P>Chen said if the ruling Kuomintang manages to field a Lien-Soong
ticket, the DPP will face a "very, very tough uphill battle" in the
coming presidential election, scheduled for March 2000.</P>
      <P>Soong, whose relationship with the KMT leadership has worsened
since the central government decided to downsize the Taiwan
Provincial Government two years ago, has consistently led in public
opinion polls as the most favorite choice for the next presidency.
Soong has on many occasions hinted that he may run on his own if the
KMT nominates Vice President Lien as its standard bearer in the next
presidential election.</P>
      <P>During their 40-minute talks, Chen said they had exchanged views
on the Tainan Science-based Industrial Park now under construction,
development projects in Tainan County and domestic political
reforms.</P>
      <P>Chen said he has suggested that President Lee take the
initiative to revise the current election and recall law to prevent
criminal ring members or those with criminal records from taking part
in parliamentary or local-level elections. "Even Japan has imposed
strict restrictions on criminal ring leaders' participation in
political elections," Chen stressed.</P>
      <P>Chen is now serving his second term as Tainan County magistrate.
His diligent, devoted working style and moderate manner have won him
much praise and respect. Many of his fans are concerned about
his political career after his current tenure.</P>
      <P>Chen said he has no intention to serve as the running mate of
any presidential candidate. Nevertheless, he said if the next
premier invites him to join the new Cabinet following next year's
presidential election, he may not turn down the offer so long as his
health permits.</P>

      <P>The Salvadoran ambassador to the Republic
of China Tuesday arrived at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) in
a BMW limousine that last week was spotted running a red light and
going the wrong way on a one-way street in central Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Local media recently reported that a Republic of China national
with 14 criminal convictions on June 24 drove a BMW limousine bearing
foreign diplomatic license plates recklessly, swerving into the
oncoming lane and running a red light in central Taiwan's Nantou
County.</P>
      <P>Witnesses reported the incident to the police, who in turn
informed MOFA when it was discovered that the limousine belonged to
the Salvadoran Embassy.</P>
      <P>MOFA summoned Ambassador David Panama on Monday for a personal
explanation after an earlier diplomatic note went unanswered.</P>
      <P>MOFA Director of Protocol John Feng on Tuesday requested a second
meeting with Panama since the ministry was "very unsatisfied" with
the ambassador's statement the day before, and asked him to provide a
more detailed explanation.</P>
      <P>A crowd of press members awaited Panama's arrival Tuesday
afternoon at the Foreign Ministry's front entrance. To avoid the
reporters, the Salvadoran ambassador entered by the west entrance
instead.</P>
      <P>Reporters noted that Panama arrived in the same black BMW
limousine that had been spotted in Nantou.</P>
      <P>Panama declined to answer reporters' questions. While offering no
explanation to reporters, Panama said, "This is a big mistake,"
adding, "There are misunderstandings." He promised that "all will be
cleared soon."</P>

    <HEADLINE>SOCIAL GROUPS TO STAGE PARADE TO CALL FOR ABOLISHMENT OF NA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  30 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A number of local social groups formed an
action alliance on Wednesday to promote the abolishment of the
National Assembly (NA) and the elimination of gang- and money-linked
politics.</P>
      <P>The alliance's convener and spokesman, Chu Hai-yuan, said the
group will organize a massive parade in Taipei on July 24 to push
major domestic political parties to heed the public demand for
abolishing the National Assembly and suspending elections for NA
deputies.</P>
      <P>Alliance representatives will call at headquarters of major
political parties and meet with the four presidential hopefuls to
solicit their support for the cause, Chu said.</P>
      <P>"We demand the passage of a constitutional amendment within a
month to legalize NA's abolishment and suspension of NA deputy
elections," Chu said.</P>
      <P>Noting that the NA's existence does not meet the fundamental
spirit of democracy, Chu said the expansion of NA's powers in recent
years has seriously distorted Taiwan's democratic system.</P>
      <P>Worse yet, Chu said, many NA deputies have abused their perks.
In addition to a monthly allowance of NT$170,000, each NA deputy
can also receive hundreds of thousands of NT dollars in extra income
during the annual NA plenary session.</P>
      <P>Chu said a large number of public opinion polls here have
consistently found that more than 60 percent of local people support
the NA's abolishment.</P>
      <P>"We hope all those who oppose the continued existence of the NA
to stand out and join the July 24 parade to express their common
aspiration and opinion," Chu said.</P>
      <P>Another convener of the alliance, Shi Ming-teh, a legislator
from the opposition Democratic Progressive Party, said many people
have expected President Lee Teng-hui to complete sweeping
parliamentary reforms during his tenure. "Much to their
disappointment, President Lee seems to lack the willpower or
sincerity to do so," Shih said, adding that now is the time for
members of the general public to stand up to push for the
NA's phaseout and other parliamentary reforms.</P>
      <P>Shih said if the NA cannot be abolished this year, it will be
even more difficult to realize that goal once the Fourth National
Assembly is elected next year.</P>
      <P>The alliance said it will launch an islandwide signature
campaign to enlist public support for its cause.</P>
      <P>The alliance is composed of the Awakening Foundation, the Labor
Front, the Taiwan Human Rights Promotion Association, the Taiwan
Medical Doctors Association, the Taiwan Professors Association, the
National Federation of Lawyers Associations, the Social Legislation
Promotion Alliance and several students groups.</P>

      <P>Stanley Yen is sticking firmly to his
decision to resign as general manager of the Grand Hotel after being
attacked by the hotel's labor union for his "work ethics."</P>
      <P>Yen announced his determination to give up his post as general
manager of the problem-plagued Taipei landmark on Wednesday as he
bade farewell to the hotel's core management. He apologized for
turning down a request from the hotel's board of directors to stay.</P>
      <P>Yen noted, however, that he will relinquish his seat on the board
of directors.</P>
      <P>He submitted his resignation to the board Chairman Koo Chen-fu a
month ago amid complaints from the employee union that he was
draining the hotel's assets and conducting waves of "personnel
cleansing."</P>
      <P>He told Koo that his job of restoring the 47-year-old hotel to
some of its original glory is now finished.</P>
      <P>Yen was defended by Human Resources manager Fan Hsi-ping, who
said that as of Wednesday, the hotel's account stood at NT$198
million, far higher than when Yen joined the staff 16 months ago.</P>
      <P>Fan said Yen's reforms have also enticed back prestigious guests
and have enabled the hotel to show a profit.</P>
      <P>The 14-florr hotel, renowned as a "modern architectural delight

    <HEADLINE>JUST SHOW THE TRUE FACE OF TAIWAN, SAYS FORMER DISSIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  30  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>While Taiwan is hoping to help mainland
China's top Taiwan negotiator get better acquainted with the island
during a visit here later this year, what he should be shown is a
question that requires careful consideration, said former mainland
Chinese democracy activist Wu'er Kaixi.</P>
      <P>In a letter to the United Daily News' "Reader's Forum" Wednesday,
Wu'er, who now lives in the central Taiwan city of Taichung, said the
long-expected, much-talked-about visit to Taiwan by Wang Daohan,
chairman of Beijing's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Strait (ARATS), will finally take place in either September or
October of this year.</P>
      <P>Taiwan had envisioned the visit as a "get to know Taiwan trip,"
but this idea has been rejected by mainland authorities, who have
said the visit should only be a high-level talk between the two
sides, Wu'er said.</P>
      <P>The mainland Chinese response caught the Taiwan people and
officials of the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) by surprise. They
cannot understand why the mainland is so insistent, and they are once
again experiencing the conservative and rigid style of the Beijing
regime, Wu'er said.</P>
      <P>Wu'er, a prominent student leader in the Tiananmen Square
incident of 1989, said he personally believes that the visit here
will allow Wang, a person who has definite influence on Beijing's
policymaking toward Taiwan, to get to know Taiwan.</P>
      <P>If Wang were to get to know Taiwan, it would be of great
significance to cross-strait relations, which have been at an impasse
over the last five decades, Wu'er noted. In addition to decades-old
historical and political rifts, Wu'er said misunderstandings and a
lack of communication have also contributed to the cross-strait
stalemate.</P>
      <P>Whether Beijing agrees to Taiwan's suggestion that Wang's visit
be a "get to know Taiwan trip," it is up to Taiwan to allow Wang to
really get to know it, Wu'er said.</P>
      <P>Arranging for Wang to gain a better understanding of the island
is a highly demanding and challenging task, Wu'er said.</P>
      <P>He said it would be a bad idea for Taiwan to seek to show off its
economic prowess.</P>
      <P>As a long-term rival to Taiwan, mainland China knows about
Taiwan's economic wealth only too well, Wu'er said, adding that he
believes that any attempt by Taiwan to show off its wealth will
backfire. It will only trigger a larger degree of defiance by the
mainland, he said.</P>
      <P>Wu'er said it would be a good but impractical idea for Taiwan to
seek to show off its democratic achievements. It will be impossible
to provide Wang with an in-depth understanding of Taiwan's
democratization in only seven days, he said.</P>
      <P>A mainlander who personally witnessed major changes and human
rights retrogression on the mainland, Wu'er said he sincerely hopes
Wang will be allowed to see for himself the true face of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Let Wang see ordinary Taiwan people, he said. Let him see the
daily life that an ordinary government employee leads; let him see
how a young man in Taiwan has made his dream come true by starting
his own business.</P>
      <P>Let Wang feel for himself that Taiwan is full of concealed
energy, and let him feel that living in Taiwan is not something to be
soiled, Wu'er said.</P>
      <P>Let him experience all the things that, while taken for granted
by the people of Taiwan, are sought after and wished for by the
people of the mainland, Wu'er said.</P>

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Kuomintang Secretary-General John Chang
said on Wednesday that he will meet with former Taiwan Provincial
Governor James Soong before mid-July for talks on the ruling party's
plans for the 2000 presidential elections.</P>
      <P>Chang has apparently altered the schedule of the meeting with
Soong from mid-August to mid-July, a move widely believed to be a
turnabout in the KMT's presidential election strategy.</P>
      <P>Following up on reports from a day earlier that President Lee
Teng-hui, the incumbent KMT chairman, has hinted at the possibility
of fielding a "Lien-Soong" ticket, Lee was asked again by reporters
on Wednesday about the probability of naming Soong as Vice President
Lien Chan's running mate, but he evaded the question, saying only
"take a wild guess."</P>
      <P>Soong has been at loggerheads with the KMT policymakers since
late last year after the central government moved to downsize the
provincial government.</P>
      <P>Confident that the people will always be with him, Soong has made
no secret of his intention to run for president in next year's
election. However, he emphasized recently that he will be running as
a KMT candidate rather than an independent.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile on Wednesday, a group of KMT members from central
Taiwan traveled to KMT headquarters in Taipei to appeal to the party
leader to consider a "Lien-Soong" ticket.</P>
      <P>They said only a "Lien-Soong" ticket can win a triumph for the
ruling party in the elections. If the central hierarchy of the party
do not listen to the people and take action soon, they will risk
triggering the indignation of all party members and the general
Taiwan public, they warned.</P>
      <P>KMT spokesman Huang Hui-cheng said that while it has been agreed
that Lien will represent the KMT as the presidential candidate, no
party decision has yet been made on his running mate.</P>

(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The US Department of Customs is to send a
mission to Taiwan from August 2-20 to examine textile manufacturers
on the island, following a previous investigation in September last
year, officials of the Board of Foreign Trade (BOFT) said on
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The department stressed to the Taipei authorities that the main
job of the mission will be to investigate the illegal transshipment
of textiles, BOFT officials disclosed.</P>
      <P>The manufacturers under investigation will not be notified in
advance that they are to be investigated by the US team. According to
the current textile trade agreement between Taipei and Washington,
both sides are supposed to prevent illegal transshipments.</P>
      <P>In the investigation which took place last year, several local
manufacturers made mistakes in questionnaires they were required to
answer, while others were discovered to have given false information
regarding manufacturer's names in the quota certificate for textile
exports to the United States.</P>
      <P>It was also discovered that some manufacturers failed to keep
records of production data, arousing doubts in US customs which
resulted in textile products from many Taiwan manufacturers being
refused entry to the United States.</P>
      <P>The BOFT called on local textile manufacturers to cooperate with
the US mission, and to keep abreast of the situation, so as to avoid
any misunderstanding.</P>
      <P>US customs noted that it is estimated that over 90 percent of
illegal textile transshipments to the United States are connected to
people of Chinese ancestry.</P>

(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's Fair Trade Commission (FTC) on
Wednesday approved a merger between Motorola Electronics Taiwan Ltd.
and Advanced Semiconductor Engineering Inc. (ASE).</P>
      <P>FTC Vice Chairman Liu Chung-jung said the commission's evaluation
shows the merger will benefit Taiwan's economic development more than
it will harm market competition.</P>
      <P>Liu said the merger will integrate the two companies' production
lines in designing, manufacturing, packing, and testing integrated
circuit (IC) products, a move which will create commercial
opportunities for silicon wafer manufacturers.</P>
      <P>The deal will also help the island's efforts to improve its IC
and IC-related manufacturing, Liu said, adding that ASE's takeover of
a semiconductor operation division of Motorola will also help
maintain stability in the local labor market.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the merger, ASE will buy out Motorola's
semiconductor operation division, which employs 1,500 people. After
selling the business Motorola will no longer be involved in IC
packing and testing in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>ASE will increase its current 26 percent market share in the IC
packing and testing sector to 33 percent as a result of the merger,

    <HEADLINE>44 NEW FISH SPECIES REPORTED IN TAIWAN SINCE 1981</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 30 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Researchers have found 44 new fish species
in the waters around Taiwan in the last 18 years, Director Shao
Kwang-tsao of the Institute of Zoology of Academia Sinica said on
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Shao reported that using funding provided by the Cabinet-level
National Science Council, Taiwan researchers have since 1981
published the discovery of 60 new fish species, although they later
found that only 44 of the recorded species are indigenous to Taiwan
waters alone.</P>
      <P>Shao noted that of the approximately 25,000 fish species found
around the world, those indigenous only to Taiwan total 2,450, or
about one-tenth of the world's total.</P>
      <P>Compared with the size of Taiwan, at less than 0.3 percent of the
world's landmass, the figure illustrates the richness and diversity
of Taiwan fish species, Shao said.</P>
      <P>This diversity, he said, is largely a result of Taiwan's
geographical location -- at the northern rim of the East Indian
islands, as well as on the rim of the world's biggest continental
shelf, and at the confluence of the East China Sea, the South China
Sea, and the Philippine Sea.</P>

      <P>The Republic of China's US$300 million aid
pledge to Kosovo has aroused positive international resonance,
according to Vatican Foreign Minister Jean-Louis Tauran.</P>
      <P>During a meeting with a visiting parliamentary delegation from
Taiwan on Monday, Tauran expressed appreciation on behalf of the
international community for the aid extended by the ROC to the
Yugoslavian province, stressing that the move has added to Taiwan's
international integrity.</P>
      <P>Tauran also told the delegation leader, Legislative Yuan
President Wang Jin-pyng, that formal diplomatic ties between the ROC
and Vatican remain stable, and dismissed the pressing question of
whether the Holy Sea will soon set up official relations with
Beijing.</P>
      <P>In addition to attending a luncheon banquet hosted by a
pro-Taiwan group in the Italian parliament, the ROC legislative
mission, accompanied by ROC Representative to Italy Hung Chien-chao,
also paid a visit to Italy's lower house on Monday afternoon and had
dinner with a dozen local opinion leaders that evening.</P>
      <P>During the dinner party, Wang voiced the hope that the Italian
parliament will support the ROC's bid to join the World Trade
Organization and the World Health Organization, and invited Italian
parliamentary members to visit Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Such parliamentary visits can help reduce the gap among Taiwan's
various political parties, thus helping build a new culture in
Taiwan's parliament and improve its image among the public, according
to Wang.</P>
      <P>The delegation arrived in Rome on Sunday for a three-day visit.
It left on Tuesday for Vienna en route to Macedonia, the ROC's new

    <HEADLINE>14 OUT OF EVERY 100 CONSCRIPTS HAVE CRIMINAL RECORD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 30 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Defense Minister Tang Fei
said on Wednesday that 14 out of every 100 new military conscripts
have a criminal record, which inflicts heavy pressure on the
management of the armed forces.</P>
      <P>Tang made the statement while attending an end-of-semester
ceremony at Chingmei Girls High School in suburban Taipei to offer
his apology again for the rape and murder of a Chingmei student by a
conscript at the Armed Forces Museum in downtown Taipei earlier this
month.</P>
      <P>Tang said he appreciates the school authorities offering him
another opportunity to express his heartfelt apology to the school's
3,000-plus faculty members and students for the rape-murder of Chang
Fu-chen at the museum on June 19.</P>
      <P>Tang said private Kuo Ching-ho's cold-blooded crime has left a
scar on the minds of all Chingmei teachers and students, adding that
the crime has also made them lose trust in the military and
confidence in the safety of local society.</P>
      <P>"I myself and the Ministry of National Defense (MND) must assume
full responsibility for this tragedy," Tang said, adding that the
military will streamline discipline and improve its management
techniques so that Chang's death will not have been entirely in vain.</P>
      <P>In addition to extending an apology to Chang's parents, Tang
said, the MND has punished 24 military officers and enlisted men for
their negligence which led to the tragedy. The military will also
mete out a harsh penalty on the murderer in accordance with the law
as soon as possible, he added.</P>
      <P>This was Tang's second visit to the school since the incident. He
paid his first condolence visit last Friday.</P>
      <P>Chen Fu-kuei, the school's president, said all faculty members,
students and their parents applauded the MND's responsible attitude
toward handling the situation.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, he still handed three letters to Tang to express
the teachers' and students' heartfelt sorrow over Chang's death.</P>
      <P>Chingmei students said in their joint letter that they used to
consider the Armed Forces Museum "a sacred place." Now, however, "the
museum has come to represent only pain in our hearts and minds."</P>
      <P>The letter also expressed the hope that military and civilian
agencies will work together to create a safer and more secure living
environment.</P>

      <P>Megawati Sukarnoputri, the presidential

      <P>Rival factions in East Timor have agreed to lay down their arms
ahead of a UN-supervised ballot in late August to decide the future

him to appear before the NPC's Foreign Affairs Committee to explain
the downturn in relations with the United States, The South China

      <P>According to the report, Zhu has also been criticized for
policies ranging from enterprise reform to mainland China's efforts

    <HEADLINE>CONSERVATIVE WEEKLY SAYS US MUST STAND UP TO MAINLAND CHINA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  June  29  (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Now that Slobodan Milosevic has lost
the war in Kosovo, it is time for the United States to start paying
serious attention to a far more dangerous dictatorship in Beijing,
checking mainland China's ambition of intimidating US allies and
someday forcing the United States out of Asia, according to the
latest issue of The Weekly Standard.</P>
      <P>The Washington-based conservative magazine wrote in its editorial
titled "From Belgrade to Beijing" that most Americans learned the
right lesson in the Kosovo conflict: Appeasement of dictators is a
disastrous error. Even former US Balkans envoy Richard Holbrooke now
admits that the Clinton administration "made numerous mistakes" in
dealing with Milosevic.</P>
      <P>The evidence of the mainland Chinese government's hostile
intentions, both with regard to its own people and to US interests
worldwide, is overwhelming. Anyone who knows the mainland Chinese
dictators understands that they want to increase their military
capabilities in order to achieve their ambition of intimidating US
allies and someday forcing the United States itself out of Asia, said
the editorial.</P>
      <P>The weekly magazine said that what is shocking about this is that
the truth has so far barely dented the comfortable bipartisan
consensus supporting the continued appeasement of Beijing.</P>
      <P>In early June, President Bill Clinton announced his intention to
renew "most-favored-nation" (MFN) status for mainland China. When
Congress votes on MFN in the next few weeks, will Republicans stand
up and send at least a symbolic message that they will not accept
business as usual with the Butchers of Beijing, any more than with
the Butchers of Belgrade? asked the editorial.</P>
      <P>It said that the big American corporations will also try to block
the tightened export controls recommended by the House's Cox
committee. Will Republicans have the nerve to place national security
and national principle above trade?</P>
      <P>It happens that the American people would support such an effort,
wrote The Weekly Standard. A new poll by the Pew Research Center
shows only 29 percent of Americans agreeing that the United States
should grant MFN status to mainland China, with 57 percent opposed.</P>
      <P>Even though advocates of engagement have succeeded in changing
the term MFN to the supposedly more salable "normal trade relations,"
it turns out that 32 percent of Americans say the United States
should grant "normal trade relations" status to Beijing, with 54
percent saying no, added the editorial.</P>
      <P>The weekly continued that the US victory in Kosovo came after
many years of inattention to and appeasement of Milosevic's tyranny.
Thankfully, the United States and NATO were so strong and Milosevic
so weak that the allies could prevail even after what Holbrooke
acknowledges to be the Clinton (and Bush) administrations' many
mistakes.</P>
      <P>But the editorial stressed that "Our margin for error in the case
of China is smaller. The longer we appease Beijing and pretend it is
some kind of 'strategic partner,' refusing to acknowledge the reality
that China is in fact a serious strategic competitor, the greater
chance that someday -- maybe soon, maybe a decade from now -- we will
pay the price for our fecklessness."</P>
      <P>Holbrooke said last week in the Senate hearings for his
nomination as US ambassador to the United Nations, "Had the United
States responded vigorously and appropriately early in the (Balkan)
crisis, we might have avoided three of the four wars that the
Belgrade dictatorship has caused."</P>
      <P>The Weekly Standard concluded that the best way to avoid a future
crisis with mainland China is not to appease it, "but to respond
'vigorously and appropriately' while there is still time to check
Beijing's ambitions, preserve peace, and strengthen the forces of
reform in China."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>ROC Foreign Minister Jason Hu on
Tuesday called on the Pacific rim countries to faithfully recognize
the Republic of China's role and functions in the region as a
"preserver of peace, vanguard of democracy, promoter of prosperity."</P>
      <P>Hu made the call in his speech delivered at a meeting of the
North California World Affairs Association.</P>
      <P>Hu also urged his American audience not to view everything
about Taiwan from Beijing perspective, nor to drag Taiwan into
issues between mainland China and the United States.</P>
      <P>Noting that the ROC looks forward to developing cordial
relations with the United States, Hu said Taipei-Washington ties
should never be affected by rifts between Beijing and Washington,
D.C.</P>
      <P>Hu pointed out in his speech, titled "Take a Closer Look at
Taiwan," that the ROC can offer valuable contributions to
future regional peace, democratic development, economic prosperity in
the Asia-Pacific as well as to international disaster and
humanitarian relief efforts.</P>
      <P>The minister went on to say that Taiwan should be admitted to
the World Trade Organization (WTO) as early as possible. Given its
economic strength, Hu said, Taiwan should even be admitted to the
International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and other major global
financial organizations to facilitate its fulfillment of
international obligations, sharing of international responsibility
and contribution to overall global economic development.</P>
      <P>Hu said Taiwan's WTO membership application should be considered
purely in terms of its own economic strength and system and should
not be affected by political considerations. "We hope to enter the
body by the end of this year," he added.</P>
      <P>Hu further said Taiwan has found the right path toward
modernization. "Our experience can provide inspiration for mainland
China and other developing countries," he noted, adding that for
developed countries, Taiwan can serve as a valuable partner in the
pursuit of regional and global advancement.</P>
      <P>Touching on recent rifts between Beijing and Washington, Hu said
the ROC has no intention to get involved in mainland China-US
relations.</P>
      <P>Stressing that Taiwan-US and US-mainland China relations are two
parallel sets of bilateral relations, Hu said Taiwan hopes its
interests and rights will never be hurt by any developments or
incidents in Beijing-Washington engagements.</P>
      <P>Hu also said as long as the Taiwan Strait can maintain
peace over the next 10 to 15 years, mainland China's social and
political systems will inevitably undergo significant changes.</P>
      <P>Emphasizing the ROC's aspiration for peace, Hu said the
Asia-Pacific region should establish a comprehensive security
mechanism to minimize regional tension and facilitate relevant
security dialogue.</P>
      <P>This was the first time that Hu managed to deliver a public
speech to a major US group since he assumed his current post. More
than 250 politicians, academics, journalists and Chinese community
leaders in the Bay area attended the meeting.</P>
      <P>Hu also attended a North American Taiwan Chamber of Commerce
meeting in Chicago before coming to San Francisco. He is scheduled
to return to Taipei Friday morning.</P>

(By Wendy Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Taiwan Provincial Governor James
Soong on Wednesday derided party politics in Taiwan, saying the
problem is that "no party is willing to shoulder its
responsibilities."</P>
      <P>Continuing an islandwide series of visits to his grassroots
supporters, Soong received his by-now usual warm welcome from
followers in the Taipei County townships of Linkou and Taishan.</P>
      <P>He reiterated the importance of the will and the needs of society
at the grassroots level, and slammed the increasing discrepancy
between the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) and the people's sentiments.</P>
      <P>Politicians should not "write empty checks" to the people during
election campaigns, Soong stressed, referring to KMT promises during
last year's county magistrate and city mayoral elections.</P>
      <P>Noting that during the last election campaign every candidate
promised to build an international airport within their jurisdiction,
Soong joked that it was lucky not all of them won the elections,
otherwise the skies would be full of colliding planes.</P>
      <P>He stressed that "sincerity is the only ticket" to persuade the
public and make them believe that the government will serve the
people and solve their problems.</P>
      <P>He was also at pains to point out that the "party transcendence"
he advocates does not negate the value of political parties, but
places the emphasis on the appointment of officials according to
their abilities, regardless of party affiliation or ethnic
background.</P>
      <P>Soong said that his goal for the future is to uphold national
security, ensure the safety of women, children and students, revive
the domestic economy, and wipe out inequality, so that everyone, and
not only a small group of privileged elite, will enjoy the country's
benefits.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PROPOSED FOUNDATION TO SET UP HOSPICE FOR AIDS PATIENTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  30  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Taiwan charity has proposed founding a
sister organization which will in turn set up a hospice for the
homeless and for terminally ill AIDS patients, a spokesman for the
Garden of Hope Foundation said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Garden of Hope, which has long been concerned about the plight of
the island's AIDS victims, said that it will hold a fund-raising
dinner on July 2. This will be followed with a charity auction of
works by famed photographer Chen Shen, as well as works produced by
AIDS patients and their nurses. The money raised will be used to
found the Garden of Mercy Foundation.</P>
      <P>The initial target for the fund is NT$5 million (US$154,321), the
foundation spokesman said.</P>
      <P>At a press conference to announce the setting up of the Garden of
Mercy Foundation, officials of the Department of Health, as well as
those from the government and private sectors, appealed to the public
to demonstrate their compassion by donating funds to the foundation
which will be dedicated to helping AIDS sufferers.</P>
      <P>The DOH estimated that as of the end of June, 2,379 people in
Taiwan have tested HIV positive, the precursor of full-blown AIDS.</P>
      <P>Actor-turned-social volunteer Sun Yueh said at the press
conference that although Taiwan people are generally warm and caring,
people diagnosed with AIDS are destined for a miserable life, shunned
by their families and society.</P>
      <P>The plan of the Garden of Mercy Foundation to set up a hospice
for AIDS victims will enable these people to end their days in
tranquility and with dignity, Sun said.</P>
      <P>Chang Li-yu, a social worker at National Taiwan University

    <HEADLINE>WOMEN'S GROUPS DEMANDS ARMY TO STEP UP SEXUAL EQUALITY EDUCATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   June   30  (CNA)
(By Wendy Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Women's rights groups from across
Taiwan on Wednesday demanded that the military step up its sexual
equality education in view of the armed forces' long-term
"paternalism" as displayed in the recent rape-murder scandal at a
military compound.</P>
      <P>A Taipei high schoolgirl was raped and murdered by an army
private at the Military History Museum on June 19. The incident has
caused a public uproar, with the military being strongly criticized
by the media for lax discipline.</P>
      <P>Chou Hui-ying, a legislator of the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) Wednesday called for a public hearing to
fully investigate the incident.</P>
      <P>Chou blasted the Ministry of National Defense (MND) for having
"bureaucratic" and "male chauvinistic" sentiments, after a ministry
official allegedly asked, "What problems can a public hearing into
the case solve?" in response to Chou's call for an investigation.</P>
      <P>As a representative of females in Taiwan, Chou said, she must
uphold an even stricter standard in supervising government agencies.
She also demanded that the government take effective measures, and
not let the tragedy repeat itself.</P>
      <P>Wang Ju-hsuan, chairman of the Awakening Foundation, a local
women's rights group, pointed out that while Defense Minister Tang
Fei has issued a public apology and held an emergency meeting to
tighten military discipline, women's groups do not need an apology
for individual cases.</P>
      <P>Rather, they want a military that respects women's safety, Wang
said, adding that she hopes the armed forces and the public learn a
lesson from the incident so that the victim will not have died in
vain.</P>
      <P>The foundation's secretary-general Chen Mei-hua said that the
rape-murder incident at the Military History Museum revealed a lack
of safe learning environment and the military's long-term disrespect
towards women.</P>
      <P>She urged the military to learn from the tragedy and reconsider
how its men are taught to have greater respect for the female gender
and sexual equality.</P>
      <P>Lee Yu-kun, assistant deputy chiefof MND's Human Resources office
admitted that in the past, the military lacked comprehensive rules on
women's issues. But with the increase of females in the armed forces,
the MND has established strict codes of conduct for both sexes in
army barracks, he said.</P>
      <P>After nearly a year of implementation, he said, the MND is still
worried that the norms might not be thorough enough, and has set up a
special committee to interview female military personnel from all
over the island for suggestions on improvements.</P>
      <P>Lee also stressed that the military already has stringent
standards on sexual harassment offenses; violators are
court-martialed, while less serious offenders are censured or removed
from the post.</P>
      <P>The military will mete out speedy and clear-cut administrative
punishments, he said, adding that a 24-hour hotline number has been
posted in each military unit to answer reports of misconduct.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN'S WTO BID SHOULD BE CONSIDERED SEPARATELY : US OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  June  30 (CNA)
(By Herman Pan &amp; Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The bids by Taiwan and mainland China
for entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO) should be
considered separately and on their own merits, said US Assistant
Secretary of State for Asian Pacific Affairs Stanley Roth on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a luncheon hosted by the Washington-based think tank
Institute for International Economics, Roth said that it is
Washington's long-standing stance that Taiwan should be granted WTO
membership once it meets WTO requirements.</P>
      <P>However, the WTO reaches decisions through consensus and Taiwan
should understand that there are factors other than the Taiwan-United
States relationship which affect its WTO application.</P>
      <P>The United States will not block Taiwan's entry into the WTO, and
before mainland China does, it should take into account obstruction's
impact on Taiwan-mainland China relations.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan has finished all bilateral negotiations with
WTO members on the terms of its entry, Taiwan's access is still in
doubt due to Beijing's opposition.</P>
      <P>Beijing, whose application has been blocked by Washington due to
trade and diplomatic disputes, insists that Taiwan not be admitted
into the WTO until it's own membership is granted.</P>
      <P>Roth also explained his usage of the term "interim agreements" in
a speech in March.</P>
      <P>Noting that technical agreements on minor aspects would not do a
whole lot to improve cross-strait relations and that the time is not
yet appropriate to resolve the entire range of Taipei-Beijing issues,
Roth said in his speech , "it seems to me...it is in the
interest...to look for something in between which would have the
advantage of being able to address significant issues, more than
technical issues and less than a comprehensive resolution."</P>
      <P>He reiterated that the current US policy -- that the US not act
as a mediator, negotiator, intermediary on cross-strait issues and
that all issues should be solved by the two parties themselves --
dates back to the Reagan administration.</P>
      <P>Roth said he hopes the two parties use the visit in the fall of
Wang Daohan -- Beijing's top negotiator with Taiwan -- to attempt to
make significant progress that brings some momentum to cross-strait
issues.</P>

      <P>The World Health Organization (WHO) next
year is expected to announce that the Republic of China (ROC) has
eradicated polio from the island, an official from the Department of
Health (DOH) said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Tu Hsing-tze, DOH director of the Bureau of Communicable Disease

a vaccination rate of over 80 percent. The ROC currently maintains a
vaccination rate for polio, tetanus, and German measles of 90
percent.</P>
      <P>Tu said that there has been no confirmed cases of polio since
1982, and that no suspected cases have occurred since 1991. Taiwan has
also established a notification system to report any outbreak of the
communicable disease.</P>
      <P>He said that the ROC has sent related documents to a WHO
committee for screening. Barring any political impediments, Taiwan is
expected to be listed in the ranks of nations that have eradicated
polio starting next year.</P>
      <P>Tu said his department's next efforts will be aimed at
eradicating tetanus and improving the standard of public health to

    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  June  29  (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Canada's top trade official said Tuesday
that a protectionist Congress and a shift of economic power to the
south and west of the United States are among the greatest
cross-border challenges faced by Canada.</P>
      <P>International Trade Minister Sergio Marchi made the remarks upon
emerging from a Cabinet meeting in which discussions focused on
Canadian-US relations.</P>
      <P>The United States absorbs a whopping 85 percent of Canadian
exports, as almost C$1 billion worth of goods crosses the longest
undefended border in the world between the two countries.</P>
      <P>Marchi said Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien and US
President Bill Clinton continue to enjoy a warm relationship. But
Congress is another matter, he said, citing recurring disputes over
Canadian softwood lumber and agricultural exports.</P>
      <P>"You have a very protectionist, inward-looking Congress, where
surprisingly too many congressmen don't even own a passport.</P>
      <P>"It gives you a sense that they are happy with America and that
they don't concern themselves with anything exterior to America," he
told reporters.</P>
      <P>Marchi termed that a "very dangerous attitude for congressmen to
take ... a very harmful position for the international community."</P>
      <P>He also noted that economic power has been shifting within the
United States from the north and northeast to the south and southwest
-- away from the Canadian border and long-standing Canadian
commercial ties.</P>
      <P>"What that means is we've got to get to know a whole part of the
United States. ... We have to take a look at a whole new north-south
axis from the one that we've been traditionally used to," he added.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 30 (CNA)
(By Wendy Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Foreign Minister Jason Hu
on Tuesday said Taiwan most gladly welcomes the mainland Chinese top
negotiator to Taiwan, Wang Daohan, for an autumn visit, and that the
ROC will make the "most proper" arrangements for his Taiwan tour.</P>
      <P>Hu extended his welcome in his speech delivered at a meeting of
the North California World Affairs Association in San Francisco on
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Hu said in his speech titled "Take a Closer Look at Taiwan" that
some people in the United States have suggested both sides of the
Taiwan Strait sign so-called "interim arrangements."</P>
      <P>However, he said, the ROC maintains that certain issues pertinent
to the rights of people on both sides of the strait, such as fishing
disputes, joint crime-prevention efforts and the repatriation of
illegal mainland immigrants, should be dealt with first.</P>
      <P>The ROC hopes to resolve these issues and sign agreements with
mainland China as soon as possible since the signing of these
agreements can be a basis for future negotiations on more important
issues.</P>
      <P>Like building a pyramid, Hu said, one must begin from the bottom
and add one block at a time. After the foundation has been
consolidated, it will add to mutual trust and lead to a more stable
relationship, he said.</P>
      <P>Hu also said that as the Asia-Pacific region develops, major
challenges emerge. Hu listed the three most profound and influential
elements facing the Pacific rim as follows:</P>
      <P>- - The Asia-Pacific region is still in need of a comprehensive
security mechanism to minimize regional tension and facilitate
relevant security dialogue;</P>
      <P>- Democratization in the region still awaits further fulfillment
and development to establish permanent regional stability and peace;
and</P>
      <P>- The economic crisis incited by the Asian financial storm has
not yet passed, and the problems remaining in each countries'
economic system are still in need of fundamental solutions.</P>
      <P>On the subject of regional peace and stability, Hu said that
tensions on the Korean Peninsula, disputes over the sovereignty of
the Spratly Islands and the instability across the Taiwan Strait
could all explode at any moment.</P>
      <P>Aside from a few existing bilateral security cooperative
structures, he said, the Asia-Pacific region still needs a "truly
effective" comprehensive and multilateral security dialogue mechanism
that enables each side to establish a consensus for peace and
to prevent conflict through regular dialogues.</P>
      <P>Hu said the mechanism does not need to exclude any specific
regional member, nor does it need to view any regional member as an
hypothetical target; its aim should be to provide a channel for
complete expression and exchanges of worries and suggestions
concerning regional peace and stability.</P>
      <P>Even if a consensus cannot be reached through this dialogue
mechanism, at least the mechanism will offer a means of communication
,he said.</P>
      <P>Hu pointed out that the ROC can offer valuable contributions to
future regional peace, democratic development, economic prosperity
and international aid efforts.</P>
      <P>The speech was Hu's first to a major US group since he assumed
his current post. More than 250 politicians, academics, journalists
and Chinese community leaders in the Bay area attended the meeting.</P>
      <P>Hu also attended a North America Taiwan Chamber of Commerce
meeting in Chicago before coming to San Francisco. He is scheduled
to return to Taipei Friday morning.</P>

Governor James Soong will officially reopen Thursday as the central
Taiwan offices of the 16 Cabinet ministries and agencies.</P>
      <P>The offices in Chunghsing New Village, Nantou County will be

    <HEADLINE>APEC MINISTERIAL MEETING BENEFICIAL TO ROC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  June  30  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China scored fruitful
results from its participation at the two-day APEC ministerial
meeting in Auckland, New Zealand, the spokesman for the Chinese
Taipei delegation said.</P>
      <P>In an interview with CNA, Vice Economics Minister Lin Yi-fu said
the first achievement was that ROC delegates held separate talks with
their counterparts from nine countries, including the United States,
Canada, Japan, Australia, New Zealand and Thailand. They all fully
supported the ROC's entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO), he
said.</P>
      <P>The second achievement was that both Vietnam and Russia agreed to
upgrade their economic cooperation with the ROC.</P>
      <P>Lin said Russia was particularly willing to share its advances
in biotechnology and aviation with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In addition to the liberalization of trade in industry and
agriculture through e-commerce, the benefit the ROC received from the
APEC meeting was that all ministers agreed to urge the WTO to take
into account APEC work to liberalize trade in six sectors, including
food, fertilizer, oilseed, aviation and automobile.</P>
      <P>"This will give some breathing space to our local industries
because it will allow three years to liberalize all six sectors,
instead of requiring immediate liberalization," Lin said.</P>
      <P>Wang and his delegation were entertained by more than 300
overseas Chinese in New Zealand, including many migrants from
Taiwan on Wednesday night, Lin said.</P>
      <P>Wang and Lin will meet with New Zealand parliamentarians on
Thursday morning before heading back to Taipei.

    <HEADLINE>LAWMAKERS LAUD DEFENSE MINISTER AS RESPONSIBLE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  30  (CNA)
(By Amanda Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Lawmakers on Wednesday praised National
Defense Minister Tang Fei for being responsible and straightforward
in handling the scandal surrounding the recent rape and murder of a
schoolgirl in a military museum.</P>
      <P>At a press conference, legislators Tsai Ming-hsien and Lee
Wen-chung, both of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP),
and Kuomintang lawmaker Chi Tzeng Li-chen criticized the lax
discipline in the military and demanded that the Ministry of National
Defense (MND) rectify the situation.</P>
      <P>However, all three applauded Tang for acting responsibly and
courageously in handling the incident.</P>
      <P>Tsai noted that during the time he served as convenor of the
legislature committee on national defense over the past three years,
he has received at least 10 petitions per year relating to serious
injuries, accidental deaths or sexual harassment in the armed
forces, which he said illustrates the problem of lax discipline.</P>
      <P>He further pointed out other discipline problems which have long
existed in the armed forces, such as excessive drinking.</P>
      <P>The problem is so serious that even legislative assistants have
been subject to harassment, Tsai claimed.</P>
      <P>Tsai urged the MND to set up and implement discipline reform
measures, and in the meantime set up a channel for dealing with
sexual harassment.</P>
      <P>Chi Tzeng threatened to review the MND's budget to prompt the
ministry to find out how the incident could have been allowed to
occur, while Lee urged the arm forces to change its methods of
dealing with such problems and set up a panel to deal with similar
cases.</P>
      <P>Lee added that there is also a need to greatly shorten the period
of compulsory military service, to implement professional
psychological counseling in the army, and to make the system of
courts martial more transparent.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BRITISH INSURANCE GROUP TAKES OVER HUNG FU LIFE INSURANCE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  30  (CNA)
(By Amanda Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Department of Insurance director Cheng
Chi-shih under the Ministry of Finance (MOF) said on Wednesday that
the financially strapped Hung Fu Life Insurance has been taken over
by British conglomerate the Prudential Corporation.</P>
      <P>Prudential is a well-known global insurance group and the biggest
in Britain. It has assets of US$190 billion, with US$18 billion-worth
of annual premiums collected from its customers, a figure larger than
Taiwan's overall insurance premiums.</P>
      <P>Cheng said he expects that Prudential's takeover will benefit the
local insurance market.</P>
      <P>With the takeover, Hung Fu's original insurance contracts will
remain effective, and the employees will keep their jobs, Cheng said,
adding that apart from a new owner, basically there will be no other
changes for the company.</P>
      <P>The first general manager of the new company will be Lian
Chia-chu, a high-ranking Prudential official.</P>
      <P>Hung Fu's problems created panic among hundreds of thousands of
its customers when news of the company's financial difficulties broke
at the beginning of this year.</P>
