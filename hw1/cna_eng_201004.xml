    <HEADLINE>Philippine representative shares absentee voting experience</HEADLINE>

      <P>Transparency, easy access and information examination are keys to a successful
absentee voting system, the top Philippine diplomat in Taiwan said Wednesday as
his office was gearing up for his country's presidential election in May.</P>
      <P>Absentee voting for overseas Filipinos will begin April 10 and close May 10, the
day when the Southeastern Asian country elects its president, vice president, 12
senators, congressmen, governors, mayors and councilmen, said Antonio Basilio,
Managing Director and Resident Representative of the Manila Economic and
Cultural Office (MECO).</P>
      <P>The Philippines' practice of the system, which was enacted in 2004, could serve
as an example for Taiwan's government, which has been assessing the feasibility
of an absentee voting system that President Ma Ying-jeou considers a necessity
in a democratic country and a must to protect the constitutional and human
rights of Taiwan's electorate.</P>
      <P>An estimated 600,000 registered voters or more -- including 15,000 in Taiwan --
among 3 million overseas Filipino workers around the world are expected to cast
their votes under the absentee voting system, which includes both physical and
postal voting, he said.</P>
      <P>Implementation of the absentee voting is sometimes difficult because voting has
to take place in embassies or consulates, he said, noting that voters also have
to travel and can probably only vote on their days off.</P>
      <P>"The expected turnout in Taiwan will be a little more than 50 percent, while the
global turnout is expected to be around 50 percent-60 percent, " said Basilio.</P>
      <P>Postal absentee voting was adopted in Taiwan for the 2004 Philippine
presidential election but had disappointing results, he went on.</P>
      <P>Basilio explained that a lot of oversea workers were caught between elections
due to contracts, so that some registered voters never received their mailed
ballots due to an address change, while those who registered in the Philippines
before going abroad did not know their future addresses.</P>
      <P>Transparency and easy access for people wishing to cast their votes are vital
for a successful absentee voting system, the representative  said,  adding that
using technology to improve information examination is equally important.</P>
      <P>Fraud never occurs in the Philippines' voting system because the government is
able to achieve this transparency and access and government officials are able
to maintain neutrality throughout the whole process, according to Basilio.</P>
      <P>The implementation of computerized vote-counting for the first time is also
expected  to improve the speed and accuracy of vote-counting, although it will
not be done in Taiwan this year, he went on.</P>
      <P>According to Taiwan's Ministry of the Interior (MOI) , there are several options
for absentee voting, such as postal voting, proxy voting, voting in advance and
transfer voting.</P>
      <P>Interior Minister Jiang Yi-hua said that after discussions with the Central
Election Commission, the ministry has tentatively decided to first introduce
transfer voting, which will allow eligible voters to vote in the constituencies
where they work instead of the constituencies where their legal residences are
registered.</P>

      <P>The 2010 Tour of East Taiwan, an annual cycle race now in its 10th year, will be
held April 17-18 as a warm-up event in celebration of the country's centenary
next year, organizers said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The race, which travels through the eastern counties of Hualien and Taitung
known for their beautiful natural scenery, is the oldest long-haul cycle race in
Taiwan, according to the Taiwan Cyclist Federation (TCF).</P>
      <P>The event consistently  attracts  large numbers of cycling enthusiasts from home
and abroad, a TCF spokesman said, adding that many cyclists have registered for
this year's race as it will mark the event's 10th anniversary and will serve as
a warm-up activity for celebrations of the country's 100th founding anniversary.</P>
      <P>This year's race will cover three categories of competition -- a 300-km road
race, a 38-km challenge and a parent-child touring event, the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>Only those who have experience cycling 100 km per day should consider entering
the 300-km race and prospective competitors for the 380-km challenge should have
experience cycling 150 km per day, the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>The Eastern Rift Valley National Scenic Area Administration under the Tourism
Bureau, which is co-hosting the event, said ordinary cyclists are welcome to
take part in the parent-child cycling tour to enjoy  the  enchanting  mountain
and coastal  vistas  of the Hualien-Taitung area along the way.</P>
      <P>Many travel agencies have also arranged cycling tour packages to coincide with
the event.</P>

      <P>With fresh seaweed cultivated near Kinmen seeing its highest harvest ever, the
Kinmen County Fisheries Research Institute announced Wednesday it would sell
30,000 kilograms of fresh seaweed to the public at favorable prices.</P>
      <P>Seaweed production in the area reached 100,000 kilograms, up almost 100 percent
compared with recent years and the highest since the institute started planting
seaweed in 2004.</P>
      <P>Seaweed was planted early this year at a 2,000-square-meter farm near Lieyu
Island -- also known as "Little Kinmen" -- located southwest of Kinmen. The
institute started harvesting the crop on March 29.</P>
      <P>Wang Han-wen, director of the institute, said that seaweed used to be cultivated
south of Kinmen's Hsinhu Fishing Port and that this was the first season it was
planted around Lieyu Island, where the seawater is of better quality and free of
pollution.</P>
      <P>The 30,000 kilograms of seaweed were offered at NT$40 per kilogram and attracted
many buyers, Wang said.</P>
      <P>The institute said that most of its seaweed would be used to make seaweed pastes

      <P>Legislator Chang Hsien-yao of the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) announced Wednesday
his intention to run in the year-end mayoral election of an upgraded Kaohsiung
City -- the result of amerger of Kaohsiung city and county.</P>
      <P>Chang said he wants to run to break the imbalance in the economic development of
northern and southern Taiwan, the confrontation between the blue camp led by the
KMT and the green camp led by the Democratic Progressive Party.</P>
      <P>He also wanted to counter the "closed-door mentality" of the green camp so that
Chinese tourists will be willing to visit Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>In the past year, the tourists have stayed away from Kaohsiung, according to the
city's hotel managers and travel industry officials. Local media have reported
that it is due to China being angry at the city inviting the Tibetan spiritual
leader the Dalai Lama to visit and showing a film about the Uighur activist
Rebiya Kadeer.</P>
      <P>Another KMT lawmaker Huang Chao-shun, who is also keen on running, said she
respects Chang's decision.</P>
      <P>Chang said that the green camp led by the DPP has maintained a closed-door
mentality, and Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu has run her city government in that kind
of ideology, affecting the willingness of Chinese tourists visiting Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"I hereby announce that if I'm elected, I will make tourists coming to Kaohsiung
raise from the one million in 2009 to five million in four years," Chang said.</P>
      <P>Chang was accompanied by his colleagues in the legislature -- Wu Yu-sheng, Wu
Ching-chih, Justin Chou -- as well as National Taiwan University professor Wang
Xiaopo to announce his intention in a news conference.</P>
      <P>Chang, originally from the People First Party (PFP) , also received a flower pot
from PFP Chairman James Soong.</P>
      <P>Professor Wang, who once taught Mayor Chen in college, said the ideology of the
DPP has led to the closed-door policy in Kaohsiung, noting that whether it is
Mayor Chen or Kaohsiung Magistrate Yang Chiu-hsing, both of whom have expressed
intention to run, they would have been hindered by the party's ideology and harm
cross-strait exchanges. Yang is also from the DPP.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a KMT official said Wednesday that the nomination for the party's
candidates for the five municipalities -- cities of Tainan, Taichung, Xinbei and
Taipei -- will be "fair, open and transparent."</P>
      <P>Su Jun-ping, director general of KMT's Department of Culture and Information,
denied that there could be cooperation between the KMT and the PFP or that there
could be "direct recruiting" without going through the preliminary selection
process in nominating the party's candidates as questioned by some hopefuls.</P>
      <P>Compared with the DPP, the KMT has yet to be certain on which candidate it will
choose to represent the party in Kaohsiung, traditionally the stronghold of the
green camp.</P>

      <P>A cartoon series developed by a Taiwanese company has made a breakthrough in the
international market, and its developers are preparing to test an online game
derived from the TV series.</P>
      <P>The flash animated TV series "Hero 108", co-produced by Taiwan's Gamania Digital
Entertainment company, Moonscoop of the U.K and Cartoon Network International of
the U.S., premiered March 1 in the United States and Britain and later in Italy
and Germany.</P>
      <P>It tells a story of how humans and animals were once friends, before an evil
character  named High Roller convinced animals otherwise. The young First Squad,
in its quest to end the conflict between the two groups, must take on High
Roller and the Zebra Brothers.</P>
      <P>The series, composed of 52 11-minute films, was inspired by a 14th  century
Chinese  novel  "The  Water  Margin."  It uses state-of-the-art technology to
appeal to a target audience of six- to 11-year-olds.</P>
      <P>The characters and initial storyline were created by Gamania, and the series was
produced through collaboration with Moonscoop and Cartoon Network International.</P>
      <P>"We are now also developing a 'Hero 108' massively multiplayer online game
(MMOG) and we're planning to test it in the U.S in May, " said Sanvy Hsieh,
Director of Gamania's Animation Development Office.</P>
      <P>In addition, Playmates Toys will produce an extensive toy line based on the
"Hero 108" series, she said.</P>
      <P>"This is a big step for us," said Hsieh, adding that they are now discussing
with Moonscoop  the possibility  of creating other interesting stories.</P>
      <P>Gamania's efforts to go international with the cartoon idea started five years
ago, Hsieh told the Central News Agency.</P>
      <P>"The negotiations with the American team took a long time because of cultural
differences, " she said at her office in Jhonghe City where is the company is
based.</P>
      <P>"For example, she said, people in the West have a different concept than those
in the East of what a hero should be like."</P>
      <P>In the end, the teams created an animated series that has appeal worldwide, not
just in Taiwan, she noted.</P>
      <P>"This experience is very valuable to our future development," she stressed.</P>
      <P>"With the growth of the Asian market, there will be many opportunities for
Taiwanese animation, " Hsieh said, adding that enterprises with the best
creative teams and strongest promotional power will have the edge.</P>
      <P>The responses to the series so far have been very encouraging and Cartoon
Network has extended the time slot for the show, Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>The series will be broadcast in Taiwan in this summer, she added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MECO head reviews Philippine-Taiwan relations, gauges impact of ECFA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  March 31 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Although the proposed cross-strait trade agreement could present challenges to
relations between Taiwan and the Philippines, it could also open opportunities,
the Philippines' top diplomat in Taiwan told CNA in an interview Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Ties between the Philippines and Taiwan are at their best in years after
strained relations due to disputes over aviation rights during 1998-2000 and
later the Spratly Islands, said Antonio Basilio, managing director and resident
representative of the Manila Economic and Cultural Office (MECO) -- the
Philippines' official authority in Taiwan in the absence of diplomatic ties.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and its closest neighbor to the south not only have signed memorandums
of understanding  ranging  from labor,  trade and investment, science and
technology, and transfer of criminals, but the Philippines is also one of the
few ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) countries that conduct
regular ministerial visits to Taiwan, Basilio said.</P>
      <P>The Philippines also attends three annual meetings on joint economic relations,
science and technology, and labor relations with Taiwan, he said.</P>
      <P>Responding to a question about the possible impact of the proposed  cross-Taiwan
Strait  economic  cooperation  framework agreement, which aims to relax tariffs
and trade regulations between Taiwan and China and is expected to be signed in
June, Basilio said that while the agreement could have an impact on the
Philippines' economy, it also presents new prospects.</P>
      <P>"Actually we've already felt (the impact) even before the negotiations began, "
he said, noting that when cross-strait travel restrictions were relaxed, the
number of tourist arrivals from Taiwan to the Philippines dropped.</P>
      <P>"We foresee that when most of the restriction to investment from the mainland is
lifted, it may result in closing and moving (to China) of some Taiwanese plants.
That means less employment of our workers in Taiwan," he said.</P>
      <P>However, Basilio pointed out that the agreement could also present opportunities
for the Philippines, which will be able to expand the concept of "economic
corridor" to include China. The Philippines  can also provide skilled labor like
teachers and engineers for Taiwanese businesses aspiring to move up the value
chain with high-end products.</P>
      <P>The economic corridor is a project aimed at linking economic zones between
Taiwan and the Philippines to make the Philippines "Taiwan's entry point to the
ASEAN market, " taking advantage of the fact products processed in the
Philippines can be seen as ASEAN products and enjoy duty-free privileges.</P>
      <P>For Taiwanese businesses that also operate in China, it might be possible to
find a mechanism to help transport products from one place to the other,
depending on their needs, he said.</P>
      <P>"We're watching the situation  (of the negotiations)  very closely," he said.</P>
      <P>The MECO would like to facilitate more two-way investment, Basilio said.
However, like Taiwan, China is also a major attraction for Philippine
corporations.</P>
      <P>"We have not been able to attract bigger companies, but we're successful in
attracting the small- and medium-sized businesses, " he said.</P>
      <P>Notable Taiwan investors in the Philippines include computer maker ACER,
information and communication service provider Wistron Corporation, automaker
Yulon Motors and some LCD manufacturers.</P>
      <P>Basilio would like to see Taiwan relax part of its trade regulations, which
"hampered our ability to export fresh food and meat products to Taiwan." He
would also like to resolve the long-standing issue of high brokerage and service
fees for Filipino workers in Taiwan by creating a mechanism that allows
employers to directly hire Filipino workers.</P>
      <P>He said his office is collaborating with Taiwanese counterparts to speed up the
judicial process for Taiwanese fishermen detained for illegally entering
Philippine waters.</P>
      <P>Reflecting on the 10 years he has served in the office, Basilio said that he was
most proud of restoring relations to the level they previously held. He added
that he was happy with the signing of agreements  in various  areas and steady
development  of many cooperation projects.</P>
      <P>Looking ahead, the seasoned diplomat said he intends to complete rules and
regulations regarding the economic corridor to enable products and workers to
move freely between the countries. His office would also like to make efforts to
increase the Philippines' share in Taiwan's automotive parts market.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Beijing urged to substantiate promised concessions in ECFA</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Chinese negotiators should substantiate the concessions that a senior Beijing
official promised would be included in a wide-reaching trade accord with Taiwan,
the deputy head of the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>SEF Vice Chairman Kao Koong-lian was referring to five guidelines mentioned
Tuesday by Wang Yi, director of the Taiwan Affairs Office of China's State
Council, for China to follow in its talks on economic cooperation framework
agreement (ECFA) with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>One of the guidelines, Wang said in an interview with a Taiwan newspaper, is
that the number of products from China to be included in the "early harvest"
program for immediate tariff concessions or exemptions will be fewer than the
number from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Second,  regarding concessionary  tariff rates,  China will primarily target
Taiwanese products or sectors that will benefit small- and medium-sized
enterprises (SMEs) and grassroots people, he said.</P>
      <P>Third, the products on which Taiwan will be asked to cut tariffs will be those
that would not affect Taiwan's less-competitive industries, Wang promised.</P>
      <P>In addition, he said, China will not push Taiwan to open its market wider to
Chinese farm produce, and China has no intention of exporting laborer to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>At a dinner in honor of Taiwanese and Chinese negotiators in the ongoing second
round of ECFA talks, Kao said he hopes the Chinese delegation will substantiate
Wang's promised concessions.</P>
      <P>Kao said Wang's remarks reflected some key points of consensus reached in
previous talks, such as the aim that Taiwan's exports to China will benefit not
just its large enterprises but also its SMEs and ordinary people.</P>
      <P>The second round of ECFA talks, to be held over two days, began at 9 a.m.
Wednesday at Ta Shee Resort, a luxury hotel in Taoyuan County, some 40
kilometers south of Taipei.</P>
      <P>After a full day of talks, Huang Chih-peng, director-general of the Bureau of
Foreign Trade under the Ministry of Economic Affairs who led the Taiwanese
delegation, said the two sides had already entered a bargaining stage on the
"early harvest" program.</P>
      <P>In the interest of striking a final deal soon, Huang said, the number of items
to be included in the "early harvest" list should not be too large.</P>
      <P>The two sides have already come to terms on more than one-third of the nearly 20
articles of the agreement, Huang said, adding that negotiations on the remaining
articles as well as the "early harvest" program and regulations  regarding
products' country of origin labeling will continue.</P>
      <P>Before the start of Wednesday talks, Huang delivered a six-minute speech in
which he said the two sides should shelve controversies and find commonalities
based on the principle of reciprocity.</P>
      <P>For his part, Tang Wei, head of the Department of Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao
Affairs under China's Ministry of Commerce, who is leading the Chinese
delegation, said the ECFA is neither a panacea nor a curse.</P>
      <P>Noting that the ECFA is an economic  accord with special cross-Taiwan Strait
characteristics, Tang said the deal should be evaluated in an objective manner.</P>
      <P>He further said the Chinese delegation will discuss the accord's "early harvest"
programs based on the principles of "swiftness, dealing with easy issues before
contentious ones, and limiting the scope of the "early harvest" lists so that a
consensus can be reached as early as possible.</P>
      <P>The "early harvest" program refers to a list of goods and services to be subject
to immediate tariff concessions or exemptions that are expected to form the
backbone of the ECFA deal.</P>
      <P>"The trade deal will contribute to mutual market opening, boost cross-strait
trade in goods and services,  and facilitate the institutionalization of cross-
strait economic cooperation, " Tang said.</P>
      <P>Opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) politicians led more than 100
supporters to demonstrate against the ECFA talks at Ta Shee Resort early in the
morning.</P>
      <P>A large number of police officers were deployed at the venue to protect the
negotiators and ensure the smooth proceeding of the talks.</P>
      <P>Protesters tried to break through the barbed wire barricades and human walls
that blocked entry to the hotel complex, sparking several rounds of physical
conflict, but the violence did not escalate.</P>
      <P>The two-day round of talks will focus on the "early harvest" programs, service
market access, mutual investment promotion and protection, as well as economic
cooperation.</P>
      <P>The first round of ECFA talks took place in Beijing Jan. 26.</P>
      <P>Minister of Economic Affairs Shih Yen-shiang said Tuesday the agreement is
expected to be signed in June.</P>

Taiwan, the officials will report first to Legislative Speaker Wang Jin-pyng and
the various party caucuses in the legislature and then to the public on the
latest developments in the negotiations.</P>
      <P>"Once it will not affect subsequent talks, we will inform the public of the
results of the negotiations so as not to give the impression that we are
conducting closed-door operations, " Ma was quoted as saying.</P>

be acceptable to both sides.</P>
      <P>On protests staged by the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) against
the ECFA talks, Su said that Taiwan is a pluralistic society and everyone has
the freedom to protest and express their views.</P>
      <P>"But we hope to hear more from the DPP about its vision for Taiwan's future," he
added.</P>
      <P>The government has projected that the ECFA will be signed in June, but critics,
led by the DPP, have opposed it based on grounds that it will make Taiwan too
economically dependent on China and lead to job losses in certain sectors.</P>

    <HEADLINE>China Times: Health insurance reform needs broad efforts</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>04/01/10  12:11:26
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>On the heels of an increase in national health insurance premiums, a bill to
revamp the debt-laden system has been submitted to the Legislative Yuan for
enactment. Fierce debate over the bill is expected, but we should know it is the
responsibility of all of us to keep the national health insurance (NHI) program
from falling apart.</P>
      <P>We must point out that any social security system, including national health
insurance, requires funding.</P>
      <P>If we cannot find a way to plug the financial holes in the NHI system, it will
run up a deficit of around NT$49 billion by the end of this year. Nonetheless,
many people prefer to turn a blind eye to this dismal fact.</P>
      <P>People want to enjoy the medical benefits afforded by the NHI system but are
unwilling to contribute a single coin more to rescue it from bankruptcy. What
they do not know is that private insurance is often more expensive and offers
less coverage than the NHI.</P>
      <P>We also have to point out that health insurance means a sharing of risks by all
involved, and those who are more healthy and wealthy are supposed to carry a
bigger share of the burden than the poor and sick, in order to maintain the
system.</P>
      <P>Since the inception of the NHI program, it has changed the lives of many people.
Previously, few families could afford to keep their premature infants in
incubators, but now all premature babies are incubated under the NHI system.</P>
      <P>The NHI has also helped save the lives of countless people with kidney problems
who previously could not afford the hugely expensive dialysis treatment that
could have bankrupted their families.</P>
      <P>Although people are aware that NHI is an integral part of their lives, they are
still resistant to any increase in premiums. Six national commercial and
industrial groups have come together to oppose the increase in the employers'
share of NHI premiums.</P>
      <P>Actually,  the health insurance premium percentage paid by employers in Taiwan
is much smaller than in the United States.</P>
      <P>Elected governments tend to reject any proposal to raise health premiums, for
fear that they might lose votes, or they sweep the matter under the carpet
rather than deal with it.</P>
      <P>However, when elected leaders do this, they are failing in their duty.</P>
      <P>Late U.S. President John F. Kennedy urged Americans to "ask not what your
country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country." This is not
unrealistic rhetoric. A healthy society depends on its responsible members. If
we want a good health care system, we have to take the responsibility to
maintain it. (April 1, 2010)</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's chief negotiator in trade pact talks with China reaffirmed Thursday
that strenuous efforts will be made to protect Taiwan industries that are
sensitive to competition from Chinese product and dependent on domestic demand.</P>
      <P>Huang Chih-peng, director-general of the Bureau of Foreign Trade under the
Ministry of Economic Affairs, made the statement upon arrival at Ta Shee Resort,
a luxury hotel in Taoyuan County some 40 kilometers south of Taipei, to continue
negotiations with the Chinese delegation on a trade pact known as an economic
cooperation framework agreement (ECFA).</P>
      <P>On reports that Taiwan had reservations about China's call for the inclusion of
cross-Taiwan Strait trade normalization clauses in the ECFA, Huang said the
agreement should focus on the purpose and scope of bilateral cooperation rather
than highlight any other specific point.</P>
      <P>Huang said he could not brief the media on any special aspect of the talks at
the moment as negotiations were still in progress.</P>
      <P>The second round of ECFA talks began Wednesday and was scheduled to conclude
Thursday evening.</P>
      <P>During the first day of talks, the two sides have already come to terms on more
than one-third of the nearly 20 articles of the agreement, Huang said, adding
that negotiations on the remaining articles as well as the "early harvest"
program and regulations regarding products' country of origin labeling will
continue.</P>
      <P>Huang and his Chinese counterpart, Tang Wei, head of the Department of Taiwan,
Hong Kong and Macau under China's Ministry of Commerce, are expected to give
briefings later in the day on the conclusions reached during the two-day talks.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, police on Thursday erected barbed wire barricades at the main
entrance of the hotel complex, after pro-independence groups staged a protest
near the hotel the previous day against the ECFA talks.</P>
      <P>A group of pro-unification activists showed up at the site to voice support for
the ECFA, while only several pro-independence radicals appeared to chant anti-
ECFA slogans. No conflict broked out between  the two groups and all of them
ended demonstrations peacefully around noon.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Talk of the day -- Will the ECFA 'early harvest' list shrink?</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>04/01/10  13:30:43
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Will there be a cutback in number of products and services to be put on an
"early harvest" list under a proposed cross-Taiwan Strait economic cooperation
framework agreement (ECFA)?</P>
      <P>That is the question that has arisen after the first day of talks between
Taiwanese and Chinese negotiators at the luxury Ta Shee Resort in northern
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>With the two sides aiming to sign the wide-reaching trade accord by June, their
chief negotiators pledged at the begining of the current round of ECFA talks
Wednesday that the discussion will follow the principles of "swiftness,
convenience and simplicity."</P>
      <P>The two sides are expected to continue discussions on the "early harvest" goods
and services to be given priority under the trade pact and will also discuss the
text of the agreement Thursday.</P>
      <P>The government has reiterated that the ECFA will have no adverse effects on
Taiwan in the short term but will definitely have many benefits in the long
term. However, critics, led by the opposition Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP), have opposed the ECFA on grounds that it will make Taiwan too
economically dependent on China and lead to job losses in certain sectors.</P>
      <P>The second round of ECFA talks will conclude Thursday evening.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from local media coverage of the issue:</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>Taiwan's top trade negotiator, Huang Chih-peng, director-general of the Bureau
of Foreign Trade under the Ministry of Economic Affairs, said both sides have
been working toward the goal of signing the pact before the end of June and have
agreed to finalize the details of the "early harvest" program soon based on the
principles of "swiftness, convenience and simplicity."</P>
      <P>Huang said at a news conference late Wednesday that Taiwan cannot afford to
waste any more time in signing the ECFA as the ASEAN Plus China trade grouping
is now in effect and Taiwan's major trade rivals Japan and South Korea have been
seeking free trade agreements with China.</P>
      <P>Huang explained  that the principles  of "convenience  and simplicity" are
basically aimed at seeking easier and workable approaches in producing the
"early harvest" lists.</P>
      <P>It's worth watching  to see whether the "convenience  and simplicity" principles
will result in a shorter "early harvest" list than the original one that had
suggested 500 items.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has listed 500 manufactured items that will be eligible for immediate
tariff reductions or exemptions once the ECFA is signed, with products from the
petrochemical, machinery, mid- and upstream textile, auto parts and flat panel
sectors to be given top priority. (April 1, 2010).</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>The DPP legislative caucus has challenged the need for the ECFA, arguing that in
the absence of a trade pact, Taiwan's exports to China  and Hong Kong surged
103.8  percent  and 55 percent, respectively, year-on-year in the first two
months of 2010, while exports to the six major Southeast Asian countries soared
65.5 percent during the same period from the year-earlier levels.</P>
      <P>However, Polaris Research Institute President Liang Kuo-yuan said the surge in
Taiwan's exports to China, Hong Kong and the ASEAN countries in the Jan.-Feb.
period was just a return to "normal levels" from a low early last year when the
global economic crunch was at its height.</P>
      <P>According to Liang, the ECFA with China will be a strategic turning point for
Taiwan, adding that if the government handles it wisely, the pact will give
Taiwan new momentum to start another wave of growth.</P>
      <P>There are too many noises in the country against the ECFA, he said. The
government should publicize the schedule of the pact's implementation and make
the contents available to the public so as to give the potential first victims
of the ECFA time to adapt, he suggested. (April 1, 2010).</P>
      <P>The Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>Ruling Kuomintang Legislator Tsai Cheng-yuan said Taiwan's gross domestic
product (GDP) is expected to increase 2 percent, or by US$8 billion a year,
after the ECFA takes effect. The increased GDP will spur tax revenue growth of
NT$30 billion a year, he added.</P>
      <P>Tsai said he will propose during the screening of an amendment to the law
governing the allocation  of government  revenues and expenditures that cities
and counties which are against the ECFA be excluded from the allocation of
central government funds.</P>
      <P>In response, Kaohsiung City Mayor Chen Chu of the DPP said the ECFA and the law
amendment are two different issues.</P>
      <P>It would be madness for the government to make policy based on the ECFA and to
use the ECFA to deepen the rift between the ruling and the opposition camps,
Chen contended.</P>
      <P>Tainan City Major Hsu Tain-tsair also slammed Tsai over the suggestion, saying
that only people with communist leanings would say something like that. (April
1, 2010).</P>

      <P>Investigators and prosecutors will soon launch nationwide raids to stop the sale
of counterfeit  and controlled drugs, officials said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The decision follows a recent directive by Premier Wu Den-yih to crackdown more
heavily on fake and substandard medicine, which can be easily obtained from
underground radio stations, on Internet sites and in adult stores.</P>
      <P>The drugs have been linked to kidney failure and an increase in the number of

      <P>According to the Pharmaceutical Affairs Act, manufacturers and sellers of
counterfeit drugs can be sentenced to a maximum of 10 years in prison and a fine
of up to NT$10 million.</P>
      <P>In the event of death from the consumption of such drugs, the manufacturers and

serious health damage, the offenders can get up to seven years.</P>
      <P>Individuals  who  are  knowingly  involved  in the supply, prescription,

    <TEXT>
      <P>A civic watchdog group proposed Thursday that capital gains be included in the
calculation of National Health Insurance (NHI) premiums as part of plans for a
second-generation program that will base premiums on total household incomes.</P>
      <P>Teng Hsi-hua, a spokeswoman for the group that is monitoring the NHI program,
said that in pushing for a second-generation NHI, the most important aspect is
the definition of "total household income."</P>
      <P>In addition to salaries and wages, total income should also include capital
gains, such as profits from stock and real estate transactions, said Teng, who
is also a member of the NHI Supervisory Committee under the Department of Health
(DOH).</P>
      <P>Although these profits are not subject to income tax, they should be taken into
account in calculating premiums to ensure the fairness of the program, she said.</P>
      <P>"Otherwise, we will have no way of making truly wealthy people pay in proportion
to their wealth," she said.</P>
      <P>Also, Teng suggested that there should be at least 22 income brackets, with the
lowest bracket set at NT$220,000, and the highest bracket at least NT$5 million.</P>
      <P>To pave the way for the second-generation NHI to replace the present system --
which considers only individuals' salaries and wages -- the DOH has drafted a
proposal to amend the National Health Insurance Act.</P>
      <P>The proposal was set to be submitted to the NHI Supervisory Committee for
discussion later Thursday before being turned over to the Cabinet.</P>
      <P>DOH Minister Yaung Chih-liang said earlier this week that he hopes the bill will
be forwarded to the Legislative Yuan for consideration by April 26.</P>

      <P>Contracted retailers nationwide began accepting payments Thursday using
EasyCards, an electronic card previously used only for paying transport fares in
Taipei.</P>
      <P>The cards have a maximum storage value of NT$10,000 and can be used for
purchases of up to NT$1,000 per payment, with a daily maximum of NT$3,000.</P>
      <P>Initially, about one out of every 100 adult consumers in Taiwan, or 100,000 in
total, are expected to use the contactless smart cards to purchase small-value
goods, EasyCard Corp. Chairman Sean Lien said.</P>
      <P>The retailers that began accepting EasyCard payments Thursday include the
country's four main convenience store chains -- 7-Eleven, FamilyMart, OK-Mart
and Hi-Life -- as well as Starbucks, Cosmed, Mister Donut, Afternoon Tea, Cold
Stone and Muji -- brands operated by President Chain Store Corp. (PCSC), which
operates 7-Eleven.</P>
      <P>The cards will also be accepted at Wellcome and Matsusei supermarkets, Pizza
Hut, Domino's Pizza, the food court of Global Mall in Taipei County, Hsin Tung
Yang, Ten Ren Tea, Dunkin' Donuts, Yamazaki Bakery, Is Coffee, Bread First
bakery, Watsons, Miramar Cinemas and Taroko Sports Plaza, according to EasyCard
Corp.</P>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin joined Lien and EasyCard  Corp. President Jason Lin at
a Starbucks and a Mister Donut store located near Taipei City Hall to buy coffee
and donuts for breakfast with their cards.</P>
      <P>"The card not only makes it more convenient for consumers, it is also a symbol
of an advanced city," Hau said.</P>
      <P>Hau's EasyCard, actually in the form of a SIM card, was built into an HTC
smartphone handset.</P>
      <P>Lin used his wristwatch, which carries an EasyCard SIM card, to pay for his
coffee and donuts.</P>
      <P>Lien said there are currently more than 8 million EasyCards in circulation.</P>
      <P>The total number of users of these cards is far less than 50 percent of the
country's population, which indicates that there is a lot of room for expansion,
Lien said.</P>
      <P>He suggested that EasyCard holders personalize their cards to avoid financial
losses if their cards are lost or stolen.</P>
      <P>"Now cardholders are only at risk for six hours after reporting a missing card,
much shorter than the 12 hours before, " Lien added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Mayor Hau lauded Lien for the contribution he has made in turning
EasyCard Corp.'s finances from red to black in a short 20 months, and for
facilitating the launch of the new payment system.</P>

      <P>The discussions on a long-awaited meeting between President Ma Ying-jeou and
Democratic Progressive Party Chairperson Tsai Ing-wen on the proposed Economic
Cooperation Framework Agreement (ECFA) with China has become bogged down in
disputes over whether it should take the form of a dialogue as suggested by Ma,
or a debate as proposed by Tsai.</P>
      <P>In a debate that follows the format used for presidential candidates, each side
would be given six minutes to present their arguments and three minutes to take
four or five questions from a panel. This is dramatic format but it would not
give the audience an in-depth understanding of the issue because the debaters
would be focusing on tactics rather than on substance. A debate is more suitable
for election candidates than for a meeting between Ma and Tsai.</P>
      <P>Ma holds a doctorate in law from Harvard, while Tsai has a doctorate in law from
the London School of Economics and Political Science. They can easily hold a
debate, but it would be a waste of their ability, as they would only give
sensational analyses of the issue.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the complicated matter of a trade pact with China does not lend
itself to a debate format. It involves the questions of why should Taiwan ink
such a pact with China? Should Taiwan opt to maintain the political status quo
or push for independence?</P>
      <P>It also involves issues such as which industries should be included in the early
harvest list and thereby be exempted from tariffs in the early stages. Of
course, this question would be irrelevant in an argument against the signing of
the pact.</P>
      <P>The problem in Taiwan is that the ruling and opposition parties never talk with
each other, they only criticize each other. They use confrontation as a means of
attracting voters and consolidating support.</P>
      <P>We hope Ma and Tsai would establish a precedent of the two main political
parties engaging in dialogue, not only because of the party leaders' capability
and training, but also because of the broad issues involved in the trade pact
with China.</P>
      <P>However, debate and dialogue are not mutually exclusive. In a dialogue, the
parties could talk and argue with each other, as the people would expect, but a
debate is more like a cockfight. (April 1, 2010)</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>With financial services not included in the just-concluded second round of talks
on a proposed trade pact with China, Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC)
Chairman Sean Chen said Thursday that more negotiations will need to be held
before the trade pact can be signed.</P>
      <P>Expanding access for Taiwan's financial service companies in China was expected
to be one of the main topics of discussion during the second round of talks on
an economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) between the two countries
that took place March 31-April 1 in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Responding to questions at a legislative committee meeting, Chen explained that
as the second round of ECFA negotiations put more focus on commodities trading,
the service industries were not included in the talks.</P>
      <P>In addition, the talks were mainly responding to calls from central and southern
Taiwan's small- and medium-sized companies and disadvantaged groups, he added.</P>
      <P>Chen said more negotiations will need to be held before the deal can be signed,
so the issues not included in the most recent talks -- which ended early that
same day -- will be discussed at some future point.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, the government did not abruptly put the brakes on the issue.</P>
      <P>He also said that any cross-Taiwan Strait-related policies should be implemented
through a step-by-step process and with proper timing.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese investors should have a proper understanding of the Chinese market
before any cross-strait exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are listed on both sides,
he went on.</P>
      <P>A media report quoted an official from the Taiwan Stock Exchange as saying that
Taiwan and China will sign an agreement on ETF listings as early as the second
half of this year after the signing of the ECFA.</P>

      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih re-affirmed Thursday the government's goal of making
Children's Day a public holiday starting in 2011, a policy he said is aimed at
highlighting the importance the government attaches to children.</P>
      <P>To ensure the April 4 holiday is added to the official calendar next year, the
Ministry of the Interior should speed up its effort to amend the law governing
the designation of commemorative days and holidays, Wu said.</P>
      <P>The premier raised the issue when the ministry delivered a report on the welfare
of children and teenagers at a weekly Cabinet meeting.</P>
      <P>Wu said government agencies should work to boost the country's declining birth
rate by encouraging young people to get married and creating an environment
suitable for raising children.</P>
      <P>According to Wu, Taiwan's fertility rate dropped to 1.02 children per woman in
2009 -- the lowest level worldwide.</P>
      <P>The trend in which Taiwanese people give birth to less children will decrease
the country's labor force, increase the dependency ratio and tilt the balance of
resource  distribution  between generations,  which  will  in  turn  undermine
the  country's competitiveness, Wu said.</P>

      <P>Any decision by Taiwan to carry out the death penalty for the first time in four
years could count as a minus against the country in the European Parliament's
review of a proposal to include Taiwan in its visa waiver program, a visiting
member of the parliament said Thursday.</P>
      <P>"I want to stress this: there is no direct relationship between those two -- the
abolition of the death penalty and visa waiver, " said Laima Liucija Andrikiene,
who is also the vice president of the parliament's Subcommittee on Human Rights.</P>
      <P>But she added, "I don't want your country to be criticized for this in the
European Parliament."</P>
      <P>If Taiwan executes a death row prisoner now, members of the European Parliament
who are not friendly toward Taiwan, those who are very good friends of China, or
those who have a strong stance on human rights might criticize Taiwan when the
visa-waiver proposal comes up for discussion in the parliament, she said.</P>
      <P>"So think about this, " said Andrikiene, a member of the Taiwan Friendship Group
in the European Parliament.</P>
      <P>For example, the European Parliament is very critical of China's No.1 ranking in
terms of death penalty executions, she said at a press meet.</P>
      <P>"Let's delete all opportunities to criticize your country before this issue
comes to the parliament, " said Andrikiene, noting that the parliament used to
pass urgent resolutions whenever a state executed someone.</P>
      <P>Andrikiene said that in April or May, the European Commission will send a
proposal to the European Parliament on whether to wave visa requirements for
Taiwanese visitors.</P>
      <P>Andrikiene, who is leading a delegation on a visit in Taiwan, said that she
brought up the issue with President Ma Ying-jeou during a meeting with him the
previous day.</P>
      <P>"We said to your countries' politicians and the president that we welcome de
facto moratorium on the death penalty, but we also encourage Taiwan to abolish
the death penalty," she added.</P>
      <P>The European Union requires all its members to abolish capital punishment,
according to the Lithuanian lawmaker.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has not carried out the death penalty since 2005, but is very likely to
do so later this year as the issue was recently catapulted into the spotlight by
the former justice minister's refusal to sign execution orders for the 44
prisoners on death row.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Andrikiene said that she and her colleagues will work to speed up the
process of including Taiwan in the EU's visa-free program in order to give
Taiwan a "very nice birthday present, " referring to the country's 100th
founding anniversary next year.</P>
      <P>In meetings with government and opposition politicians, the visiting delegation
also raised the possibility of a free-trade agreement (FTA) between Taiwan and
the EU.</P>
      <P>However,  Andrikiene  said she has observed that Taiwanese politicians have not
set any specific goals for such an agreement in the future. She urged Taiwan to
take the European market more seriously as there are 500 million consumers
there.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, according to another EU parliamentarian Bastiaan Belder, the
delegation also gave Taiwan politicians the assurance that the European
Parliament will continue its arms embargo on China.</P>

      <P>The Cabinet is planning to revise the formula that guides the drawing of poverty
lines, to exclude the influence of extreme values, an official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Minister without Portfolio James Hsueh noted that the poverty lines in Taipei
City, Kaohsiung City and Taiwan Province are calculated separately, and due to
some extreme values, the poverty line in Taipei City tends to be higher than it
should be.</P>
      <P>According to Hsueh, the Cabinet's latest proposed amendment to the Public
Assistance Act will use the median income of all Taiwanese households to
calculate the poverty lines, which will help the government identify low-income
households and lower-middle-income households.</P>
      <P>Another focus of the bill will be to expand the coverage of public assistance
from low-income households to lower-middle-income households, Hsueh went on.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Economic Daily News: A review of 2nd industrial structure reform</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>04/01/10  17:43:43
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>In the past five decades from 1952 to 2001, Taiwan has recorded an average
growth rate of 8.1 percent, which is higher than those of Japan and South Korea,
both of which were known for fast economic recovery after World War Two, and
higher than the growth posted by China in the last two decades.</P>
      <P>American economist Simon Kuznets, a Nobel laureate in economics in 1971, has
pointed out that the transformation of industrial structure is a necessary
element of economic development.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's industrial structure has undergone two transformations in the last five
decades, with the second less successful than the first in terms of its
contribution to overall economic development.</P>
      <P>The first transformation, which shifted Taiwan's economic focus from agriculture
to industry, took place in the two decades after 1952.</P>
      <P>The government at the time used agriculture to back up the development of
industry, while at the same time harnessing industry to promote the development
of agriculture.</P>
      <P>During those two decades, the country saw an average annual economic growth rate
of 9.7 percent, and an unemployment rate of 1.5 percent. The country accumulated
a huge trade surplus to offset its financial deficit and distributed the wealth
evenly, narrowing the gap between the rich and the poor.</P>
      <P>It led the four Asian newly developed states in both economic growth and export
volume during that period.</P>
      <P>The second transformation began in the late 1970s when the labor-intensive
industry that was the backbone of Taiwan's economy at the time was losing its
competitive advantage because of the increase in local labor costs and
competition from other Asian states that boasted abundant cheap labor.</P>
      <P>The government then began to help with the development of technology-intensive
industries. The pace of transformation was accelerated by many Taiwanese
scientists who were educated and trained in the West and opted to return to
start hi-tech companies.</P>
      <P>Most notable among them is the electronic information industry. Their share in
the country's manufacturing sector had increased from 12.6 percent in 1981 to 38
percent in 2001.</P>
      <P>The export value of electronic information products, which stood at US$39.3
billion in 2009, declined from a peak of US$51.2 billion in 2000 because of
reduced demand from the international market, accounting for 32 percent of
Taiwan's total exports that year.</P>
      <P>The second transformation, which lasted until 2001, registered an average growth
rate of 6.7 percent, which is about two-thirds that of the first transformation,
while the unemployment rate, at 4.6 percent, was three times more than the 1.4
percent of the first transformation.</P>
      <P>The wealth gap also worsened, with the ratio of incomes of the richest 20
percent of the population to that of the bottom 20 percent of the population
increasing from 4.2 times in 1981 to 6.4 times in 2001.</P>
      <P>The differences were attributed to four causes:</P>
      <P>-- The momentum the electronics industry contributed to the growth of the
overall economy in the second transformation was not strong enough because of
its relatively lower added value;</P>
      <P>-- The government did not do enough to help the flagging labor-intensive
industries;</P>
      <P>--  The government  failed to cope with the problems  of insufficient jobs and
uneven distribution of wealth brought about by the hi-tech industries; and</P>
      <P>-- The government followed economic principles in dealing with the problems
during the first industrial transformation, but gave politics the top priority
in handling problems during the second transformation.</P>
      <P>Without addressing these four causes, the country's economy cannot be revived.

    <HEADLINE>Examination Yuan approves new appraisal system for civil servants</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Examination Yuan approved an amendment to the Civil Service Performance
Evaluation Act Thursday, which would require that all government agencies give
at least 3 percent of their staffers a "C" grade in their yearly evaluations.</P>
      <P>The amendment, which proposes that civil servants be retired or fired if they
get three "Cs" over 10 years, will be forwarded to the the Legislative Yuan for
review.</P>
      <P>"We will respect whatever the decision the Legislature makes in this regard, "
said Examination Yuan President John Kuan.</P>
      <P>However, the Taiwan Civil Servants Association, a non-profit organization
established in October 2009, said it will lobby the Legislative Yuan and the
Presidential Office to reject the amendment.</P>
      <P>Chairman of the association Chen Chuan-ching, who is a Taipei City government
official, said Kuan's top-down decision on the 3-percent C-grade quota system
would not help to boost efficiency in the civil service as Kuan has claimed, but
rather would hurt morale among public servants.</P>
      <P>"We suggest that the Examination Yuan change the 3-percent C-grade quota system
from a 'ratio system' to a 'conditional system,'" Chen said.</P>
      <P>The Examination Yuan should work out standardized assessment criteria for public
servants, he added.</P>
      <P>It would be more reasonable to stipulate that anyone who fails to meet the
criteria be given a "C" grade, rather than to force government agencies to give
at least 3 percent of their staffers a "C" in the yearly evaluations, he
suggested.</P>
      <P>There are many other laws such as the statute on discipline of public
functionaries and law on retirement of public functionaries that include
guidelines on discipline, therefore, the Civil Service Performance Evaluation
Act should remain a mechanism designed to encourage civil servants, he said.</P>
      <P>In  related  news,  Huang  Yea-baang,  newly  appointed secretary-general of the
Examination Yuan, took up his post Thursday, filling the vacancy left by Lin
Shui-ji, who recently resigned for health reasons.</P>
      <P>Huang, who will have to address the controversy over the 3-percent C-grade quota
system, said he will do his utmost to communicate with legislators on the issue.</P>

      <P>A Taiwanese fishing boat managed to escape to safety after it was attacked and
chased by pirates in waters near Somalia in eastern Africa early Thursday
morning, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said.</P>
      <P>The "Juimanfa, " a Donggang-based lone-line fishing boat, was in waters 395
miles southeast of Somalia's Cape Guardafui when it was attacked by pirates on
cutters released from a bigger boat disguised as a Taiwanese vessel around the
early hours, Chen Shih-liang, director of the ministry's African Affairs,  said
in a press conference.</P>
      <P>Pirates from the cutters fired 50 to 60 rounds of bullets, injuring an
Indonesian crew member in his leg.</P>
      <P>The injured crewman is now in stable condition although the bullet remains
inside his leg, Chen said, quoting Juimanfa's skipper Huang Kun-jui.</P>
      <P>The 14-men crew of the Taiwanese fishing boat include two Taiwanese and 12
Indonesians.</P>
      <P>After sailing at full speed for three hours, Juimanfa was able to get rid of the
pirates who had chased it, Chen said, adding that the Taiwanese vessel's radar
screen shows no sign of any other boat within 12 miles.</P>
      <P>The fishing boat is now headed towards the Maldives and will take less then 100
hours to reach there.</P>
      <P>Chen said the ministry has asked the International Maritime Bureau under the
London-based International Maritime Organization to help inform other vessels in
the waters of the incident and ask them to be on alert.</P>
      <P>In addition, Taiwan's fishery commissioners in the Indian Ocean area have asked
the Maldives to provide medical assistance to the injured crewman after the
boat's arrival.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the wife of the captain of another Taiwan long-liner operating on the
waters when the incident occurred, "Zechuhtsai", asked the Liuqiu Fishermen's
Association, with which it is registered, for help earlier in the day after
losing contact with her husband.</P>
      <P>A Taiwanese fishing boat, "Win Far No. 161" was released in early February after
its owner paid an unannounced amount of ransom to Somalia pirates who had
kidnapped the ship and held its crew captive since April 6 last year.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Fueled by the anticipated inking of a Taiwan-China trade deal in the second half
of this year, housing prices in northern Taiwan are expected to continue soaring
in the coming months, a property expert said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Ni Ze-jen, an executive of Housing Monthly, said the housing market in northern
Taiwan will remain bullish in the second half of the year, pushed up by the
signing of the economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA)  and increased
difficulties in land acquisitions.</P>
      <P>The misery index for potential home buyers in northern regions, particularly in
the greater Taipei area of Taipei City and Taipei County, is set to keep on
rising, he said, adding that "land and property prices will not reverse any time
soon."</P>
      <P>According to a report by Housing Monthly, house prices in 10 of the
administrative areas in Taiwan's north have climbed to historic levels.</P>
      <P>Among Taipei City's 12 districts, house prices in four of them -- Wanhua,
Beitou, Nangang and Wenshan -- have surged to new highs as new projects have hit
the market.</P>
      <P>The Zenith, a luxury house project recently launched by Huaku Development Co.,
Ltd. in the Nangang district, fetches nearly NT$1 million (US$31,500) per ping
(an equivalent to 3.305 square meters) -- the highest residential property price
for that district in eastern Taipei.</P>
      <P>Huaku, a listed company on the Taiwan Stock Exchange, claims that the project
sold out in just 10 days. Property and real estate prices in Nangang have more
than doubled in recent years thanks to its hub location for several transport
networks.</P>
      <P>In the suburban Wenshan and Beitou districts, house prices have also fetched a
new high of NT$800,000 per ping in recent weeks, leaving market dealers
flabbergasted.</P>
      <P>In recent months, house and land prices in Banciao, Zhonghe, Yunghe and Xindian
in Taipei County have also climbed markedly, in part propped up by the booming
property market in neighboring Taipei City.</P>
      <P>"A comparison effect in housing prices between Taipei City and Taipei County has
emerged," Ni said.</P>
      <P>In the area of Banciao, in which the Taipei county government is based,
residential property prices have also fetched a new high of NT$850,000 per ping
-- heralding fiercer competition in the special district.</P>
      <P>Even in Linkou, an area where house prices have remained lower due to over-
supply, a new high of NT$400,000 per ping has been seen. Analysts, however, are
cautious about whether local housing prices will stay at the current high level.
Recent sales figures are key indicators to predict future trends, they noted.</P>
      <P>In Hsinchu City, some 85 km south of Taipei, Huaku has also launched a 25-floor
luxury home project at the Hsinchu Science Park, at a record-breaking NT$480,000
per ping.</P>

      <P>An exhibition opened at the National Palace Museum (NPM) Thursday to showcase
110 works by Taiwanese artist Chiang Chao-shen.</P>
      <P>Chiang, a former Deputy Director of the NPM, died in 1996.</P>
      <P>"Chiang  was  not  only  renowned  both  domestically  and internationally as a
historian of Chinese art, he was also an outstanding painter, calligrapher and
seal carver, " said the organizer of the exhibition.</P>
      <P>Last year, Chang Kuei-na, Chiang's wife, donated 110 of Chiang's works to the
museum, some of which will be displayed at the exhibition, including 50
paintings, 10 works of calligraphy and 50 seals.</P>
      <P>Nearly all the donated paintings and calligraphic works come from the mature
phase of Chiang's career, with the paintings sometimes presenting a peaceful and
gentle manner but sometimes a bold and forceful one that shows the artist's
strong personal style, according to the organizer.</P>
      <P>"The exhibit will show the actual seals, impressions in red from the seal faces,
and ink rubbings of the engraved sides, " the organizer went on, adding that
audiences will be able to appreciate Chiang's choice of materials,  the content
of his texts, the arrangement of the seal faces and the wonder of his carving
techniques.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou hopes a debate with the leader of the opposition
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) will help the public better understand the
contents of a proposed trade pact with China, an official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>"It is our established stance to engage the opposition leader in rational
dialogue, and debate is a form of dialogue, " Presidential Office spokesman Lo
Chih-chiang said at a news conference.</P>
      <P>Lo co-hosted the news conference  with DPP spokesman Tsai Chi-chang, during
which they announced that Ma will hold the debate with DPP Chairperson Tsai Ing-
wen on issues regarding the contentious cross-Taiwan Strait economic cooperation
framework agreement (ECFA) before the end of April.</P>
      <P>The announcement came after Liao Liou-yi, secretary-general to the president,
met with DPP Secretary-General Su Jia-chyuan earlier in the day to discuss the
feasibility of Ma engaging Tsai in a debate on the pros and cons of Taiwan
striking the ECFA deal with China.</P>
      <P>While the Ma administration has repeatedly touted the benefits the proposed
agreement could bring for Taiwan and the potential disadvantages Taiwan could
face without such a pact, the DPP-led opposition camp has questioned the wisdom
of striking such a deal, which it says will undermine Taiwan's sovereignty by
increasing its economic dependence on China.</P>
      <P>The pro-independence opposition is also pushing for a national</P>
      <P>referendum on the ECFA initiative and for greater transparency in cross-strait
ECFA talks.</P>
      <P>During the Liao-Su talks, Lo said, both sides quickly came to terms on
commissioning Public Television Service (PTS) to organize the debate.</P>
      <P>As for the setting, format, duration, procedures and other technical details of
the debate, Lo said the Presidential Office will discuss them with the DPP after
PTS comes up with an initial blueprint.</P>
      <P>Asked whether Ma will debate with Tsai in his capacity as the country's head of
state or as chairman of the ruling Kuomintang (KMT), Tsai Chi-chang said the DPP
does not care about Ma's identity in the debate, since he holds both positions.</P>
      <P>Lo echoed Tsai Chi-chang's comments, saying that Ma is unlikely to give
different views on the same topic simply because he is speaking in a different
capacity.</P>
      <P>Tsai Chi-chang further said the DPP simply wants access to updated information
about relevant trade figures or progress in the ECFA talks.</P>
      <P>"We hope each side will refrain from spending too much time questioning the
authenticity of data or figures presented by the other during the debate because
doing so will cut the time available for discussing substantive issues," Tsai
Chi-chang said.</P>
      <P>In response, Lo said the government has consistently kept all ECFA-related
information transparent.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, PTS Vice President Chung Yu-yuan said the station will present a
draft format for the planned debate next week for review by both sides.</P>
      <P>PTS has a lot of experience organizing debates on public issues, including
debates among presidential candidates. Chung said it will also study the
feasibility of inviting representatives of civic groups to pose questions in the
debate.</P>

      <P>The International Student Identity Card (ISIC) issued to students in Taiwan has
now become a multi-purpose card, an official of a cultural and education
foundation said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The card, which previously was mainly used by students intending to travel
abroad to obtain cheaper flights and other savings, can now be used as a student
ID, an Easy Card for public transport travel and an I-cash card, for making
small purchases.</P>
      <P>"Five schools in Taiwan have so far signed up to use the ISIC, " said James
Tsai, director of the Kang Wen Culture and Education Foundation, adding that
additional schools are also planning to adopt the cards.</P>
      <P>The ISIC  is issued  by the ISIC  Association,  the only internationally
accepted proof of full-time student status. According to the association, the
card is endorsed by organizations such as UNESCO), the European Council on
Culture and the Andean Community of Nations.</P>
      <P>The card is recognized by universities, academic institutions, student
organizations,  national governments  and ministries of education around the
world. "More than 70 million students from 163 countries are using the cards for
access to cheap flights and other travel fees," Tsai said.</P>
      <P>"As colleges and universities seek to become more international in Taiwan, we
believe more schools will consider adopting the cards," he said.</P>

      <P>Taiwan and China failed to exchange their formal "early harvest lists" Thursday
at the end of the second round of talks on a proposed economic cooperation
framework agreement (ECFA) between the two sides.</P>
      <P>"Although both sides screened listed items and exchanged industry information
one by one, and reached consensus on most of the items, we did not exchange the
`early harvest lists, '" Vice Minister of Economic Affairs Liang Kuo-shin told a
news conference after the talks, which kicked off a day earlier at a resort in
Taoyuan County near Taipei.</P>
      <P>The "early harvest lists" refer to lists of goods and services that will enjoy
preferential or zero tariffs in future cross-Taiwan Strait trade -- a critical
part of the ECFA.</P>
      <P>"In the talks, we tried to get what we wanted and keep what we wanted to keep, "
he said, adding that the Chinese side agreed not to include an opening of
Chinese labor and more agricultural products on its "early harvest list" so as
not to impact Taiwan's small businesses.</P>
      <P>According  to Liang,  progress was made in this round of negotiations as the two
sides forged common ground on the "early harvest lists" and on the text of the
planned ECFA, as well as on regulations on the labeling of product origin.</P>
      <P>"Both agreed to make the most practical  and professional arrangements by fully
considering the characteristics of cross-strait trade," he said.</P>
      <P>Huang Chih-peng, director-general of the Bureau of Foreign Trade and Taiwan's
chief delegate at the talks, said both sides held comprehensive discussions and
exchanged opinions on the listed items.</P>
      <P>He also urged China to consider  allowing  some Taiwanese agricultural  and
fishing exports to enter the Chinese market duty-free and the Chinese delegates
promised to study the issue after returning home.</P>
      <P>The Taipei-based Straits Exchange Foundation, which organized the just-concluded
talks along with its Chinese counterpart,  the Association for Relations Across
the Taiwan Straits, said both sides agreed to step up the pace in clinching an
ECFA and to hold a third round of negotiations in China. The first round of
talks was held in Beijing in January.</P>
      <P>Tang Wei, head of the Department of Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau under China's
Ministry of Commerce, who led the Chinese delegation at the negotiations, said
that "we have not reached a final agreement on the `early harvest program'"  and
that "we will continue our discussions in the next round of negotiations."</P>
      <P>"The two sides have conducted negotiations on the opening of a small number of
listed items and a few industries, " he pointed out. But he added "the situation
between Taiwan and China means we are still far from practicing liberalized
trade."</P>
      <P>Echoing Liang's view, Tang, however, added that "unlimited communication and
exchanges of ideas have helped us forge common ground and make noticeable
progress."</P>
      <P>"China will do its best to mitigate the impact of the ECFA on Taiwan's
vulnerable industries and grassroots people," he went on.</P>
      <P>"We fully understand that the sizes and competitiveness of industries on both
sides must be taken into account when negotiating the final `early harvest
lists,'" he said.</P>

      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairwoman Lai Shin-yuan expressed optimism
Thursday about the prospects for signing a proposed wide-reaching trade pact
with China in June as scheduled.</P>
      <P>In a press statement issued by the Cabinet-level council at the end of a second
round of cross-Taiwan Strait talks on the economic cooperation framework
agreement (ECFA), Lai said the significance of the just-concluded negotiations
lies in ensuring that no sector will fall victim to the ECFA deal.</P>
      <P>More strenuous efforts will be made in future rounds of talks to clearly specify
the sectors that will benefit from the deal, Lai said in the statement.</P>
      <P>She further said the talks gave form to what the government has promised over
the past year -- that the "early harvest" program that forms the backbone of the
ECFA will not include any agricultural items that Taiwan does not import from
China at present, or traditionally domestic demand-oriented industries that are
sensitive to market changes.</P>
      <P>The two sides have also reached consensus that China will not ask Taiwan to open
its doors to Chinese workers, Lai added.</P>
      <P>The second round of ECFA talks began Wednesday at Ta Shee Resort in northern
Taiwan and concluded at noon Thursday, half a day earlier than originally
scheduled.</P>

      <P>A Taiwanese fishing boat that has not been in contact for days might have been
taken by Somali pirates, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a pres release
late Thursday.</P>
      <P>The ministry said that it was informed by the Fishery Agency under the Council
of Agriculture and the Coast Guard Administration earlier in the day that the
Zechuhtsai, a long-line fishing boat, had not made contact since the afternoon
of March 30.</P>
      <P>At the time of the last contact, the Zechuhtsai was around 395 nautical miles
southeast of Somalia's Cape Guardafui, where another Taiwanese long-liner, the
Juimanfa, was later attacked and chased by Somali pirates.</P>
      <P>Pirates from cutters released from a bigger boat disguised as a Taiwanese vessel
fired 60 to 80 rounds at the Juimanfa in the early hours of Thursday, injuring
an Indonesian crewman.</P>
      <P>The Juimanfa managed to escape to safety after being chased by the cutters for
three hours. As of press time, it was headed toward the Maldives to seek medical
assistance for the injured man.</P>
      <P>The ministry said that it has called on the International Maritime Bureau's
Piracy Reporting Center and the Bahrain liaison office  of the U.S.  Fifth Fleet
Command,  as well as other international anti-piracy organizations, to help
search for and rescue the missing Taiwan fishing boat.</P>
      <P>Another Taiwanese boat, the Win Far No. 161 was released in early February after
its owner paid an undisclosed amount of ransom to the Somali pirates who
kidnapped the ship and held its crew captive since April 6 last year.</P>

      <P>Eight Taiwanese citizens have applied to take part in a space journey at a cost
of US$200,000 per person, which is expected to create a fad for space travel if
they return safely to Taiwan, a local travel agency said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Virgin Galactic,  a space tourism operator affiliated with billionaire Richard
Branson's London-based Virgin Group,  which launched the travel plan initiative,
has collected fares from more than 330 aspiring amateur astronauts who are
willing to spend big money to experience about six minutes of suborbital
spaceflight, according to Royal China Express, the Taiwan agent for Virgin
Galactic.</P>
      <P>The company's suborbital spaceship SpaceShipOne will be airlifted into the skies
for its maiden flight at the end of this year after receiving  approval  from

travel agency.</P>
      <P>Six of the eight aspiring space travelers, including a surgeon, engineers  at
the Hsinchu  Science-Based  Industrial  Park and businessmen, have already paid
their fares, while a couple operating a jewelry business who filed applications
earlier that day were scheduled to pay their fares next week in the hope of

      <P>A Taiwanese fishing boat managed to escape to safety after it was attacked and
chased by pirates in waters near Somalia in eastern Africa early Thursday
morning, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said.</P>
      <P>The "Juimanfa, " a Donggang-based lone-line fishing boat, was in waters 395
miles southeast of Somalia's Cape Guardafui when it was attacked by pirates on
cutters released from a bigger boat disguised as a Taiwanese vessel around the
early hours, Chen Shih-liang, director of the ministry's African Affairs,  said
in a press conference.</P>
      <P>Pirates from the cutters fired 50 to 60 rounds of bullets, injuring an
Indonesian crew member in his leg.</P>
      <P>The injured crewman is now in stable condition although the bullet remains
inside his leg, Chen said, quoting Juimanfa's skipper Huang Kun-jui.</P>
      <P>The 14-men crew of the Taiwanese fishing boat include two Taiwanese and 12
Indonesians.</P>
      <P>After sailing at full speed for three hours, Juimanfa was able to get rid of the
pirates who had chased it, Chen said, adding that the Taiwanese vessel's radar

      <P>The fishing boat is now headed towards the Maldives and will take less then 100
hours to reach there.</P>
      <P>Chen said the ministry has asked the International Maritime Bureau under the
London-based International Maritime Organization to help inform other vessels in
the waters of the incident and ask them to be on alert.</P>

      <P>Fueled by the anticipated inking of a Taiwan-China trade deal in the second half
of this year, housing prices in northern Taiwan are expected to continue soaring
in the coming months, a property expert said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Ni Ze-jen, an executive of Housing Monthly, said the housing market in northern
Taiwan will remain bullish in the second half of the year, pushed up by the
signing of the economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA)  and increased
difficulties in land acquisitions.</P>
      <P>The misery index for potential home buyers in northern regions, particularly in
the greater Taipei area of Taipei City and Taipei County, is set to keep on
rising, he said, adding that "land and property prices will not reverse any time
soon."</P>
      <P>According to a report by Housing Monthly, house prices in 10 of the
administrative areas in Taiwan's north have climbed to historic levels.</P>
      <P>Among Taipei City's 12 districts, house prices in four of them -- Wanhua,
Beitou, Nangang and Wenshan -- have surged to new highs as new projects have hit
the market.</P>
      <P>The Zenith, a luxury house project recently launched by Huaku Development Co.,
Ltd. in the Nangang district, fetches nearly NT$1 million (US$31,500) per ping
(an equivalent to 3.305 square meters) -- the highest residential property price
for that district in eastern Taipei.</P>
      <P>Huaku, a listed company on the Taiwan Stock Exchange, claims that the project
sold out in just 10 days. Property and real estate prices in Nangang have more
than doubled in recent years thanks to its hub location for several transport
networks.</P>
      <P>In the suburban Wenshan and Beitou districts, house prices have also fetched a
new high of NT$800,000 per ping in recent weeks, leaving market dealers
flabbergasted.</P>
      <P>In recent months, house and land prices in Banciao, Zhonghe, Yunghe and Xindian
in Taipei County have also climbed markedly, in part propped up by the booming
property market in neighboring Taipei City.</P>
      <P>"A comparison effect in housing prices between Taipei City and Taipei County has
emerged," Ni said.</P>
      <P>In the area of Banciao, in which the Taipei county government is based,
residential property prices have also fetched a new high of NT$850,000 per ping
-- heralding fiercer competition in the special district.</P>
      <P>Even in Linkou, an area where house prices have remained lower due to over-
supply, a new high of NT$400,000 per ping has been seen. Analysts, however, are
cautious about whether local housing prices will stay at the current high level.
Recent sales figures are key indicators to predict future trends, they noted.</P>
      <P>In Hsinchu City, some 85 km south of Taipei, Huaku has also launched a 25-floor
luxury home project at the Hsinchu Science Park, at a record-breaking NT$480,000
per ping.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou hopes a debate with the leader of the opposition
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) will help the public better understand the
contents of a proposed trade pact with China, an official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>"It is our established stance to engage the opposition leader in rational
dialogue, and debate is a form of dialogue, " Presidential Office spokesman Lo
Chih-chiang said at a news conference.</P>
      <P>Lo co-hosted the news conference  with DPP spokesman Tsai Chi-chang, during
which they announced that Ma will hold the debate with DPP Chairperson Tsai Ing-
wen on issues regarding the contentious cross-Taiwan Strait economic cooperation
framework agreement (ECFA) before the end of April.</P>
      <P>The announcement came after Liao Liou-yi, secretary-general to the president,
met with DPP Secretary-General Su Jia-chyuan earlier in the day to discuss the
feasibility of Ma engaging Tsai in a debate on the pros and cons of Taiwan
striking the ECFA deal with China.</P>
      <P>While the Ma administration has repeatedly touted the benefits the proposed
agreement could bring for Taiwan and the potential disadvantages Taiwan could
face without such a pact, the DPP-led opposition camp has questioned the wisdom
of striking such a deal, which it says will undermine Taiwan's sovereignty by
increasing its economic dependence on China.</P>
      <P>The pro-independence opposition is also pushing for a national</P>
      <P>referendum on the ECFA initiative and for greater transparency in cross-strait
ECFA talks.</P>
      <P>During the Liao-Su talks, Lo said, both sides quickly came to terms on
commissioning Public Television Service (PTS) to organize the debate.</P>
      <P>As for the setting, format, duration, procedures and other technical details of
the debate, Lo said the Presidential Office will discuss them with the DPP after
PTS comes up with an initial blueprint.</P>
      <P>Asked whether Ma will debate with Tsai in his capacity as the country's head of
state or as chairman of the ruling Kuomintang (KMT), Tsai Chi-chang said the DPP
does not care about Ma's identity in the debate, since he holds both positions.</P>
      <P>Lo echoed Tsai Chi-chang's comments, saying that Ma is unlikely to give
different views on the same topic simply because he is speaking in a different
capacity.</P>
      <P>Tsai Chi-chang further said the DPP simply wants access to updated information
about relevant trade figures or progress in the ECFA talks.</P>
      <P>"We hope each side will refrain from spending too much time questioning the
authenticity of data or figures presented by the other during the debate because
doing so will cut the time available for discussing substantive issues," Tsai
Chi-chang said.</P>
      <P>In response, Lo said the government has consistently kept all ECFA-related
information transparent.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, PTS Vice President Chung Yu-yuan said the station will present a
draft format for the planned debate next week for review by both sides.</P>
      <P>PTS has a lot of experience organizing debates on public issues, including
debates among presidential candidates. Chung said it will also study the
feasibility of inviting representatives of civic groups to pose questions in the
debate.</P>

      <P>The International Student Identity Card (ISIC) issued to students in Taiwan has
now become a multi-purpose card, an official of a cultural and education
foundation said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The card, which previously was mainly used by students intending to travel
abroad to obtain cheaper flights and other savings, can now be used as a student
ID, an Easy Card for public transport travel and an I-cash card, for making
small purchases.</P>
      <P>"Five schools in Taiwan have so far signed up to use the ISIC, " said James
Tsai, director of the Kang Wen Culture and Education Foundation, adding that
additional schools are also planning to adopt the cards.</P>
      <P>The ISIC  is issued  by the ISIC  Association,  the only internationally
accepted proof of full-time student status. According to the association, the
card is endorsed by organizations such as UNESCO), the European Council on
Culture and the Andean Community of Nations.</P>
      <P>The card is recognized by universities, academic institutions, student
organizations,  national governments  and ministries of education around the
world. "More than 70 million students from 163 countries are using the cards for
access to cheap flights and other travel fees," Tsai said.</P>
      <P>"As colleges and universities seek to become more international in Taiwan, we
believe more schools will consider adopting the cards," he said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan and China failed to exchange their formal "early harvest lists" Thursday
at the end of the second round of talks on a proposed economic cooperation
framework agreement (ECFA) between the two sides.</P>
      <P>"Although both sides screened listed items and exchanged industry information
one by one, and reached consensus on most of the items, we did not exchange the
`early harvest lists, '" Vice Minister of Economic Affairs Liang Kuo-shin told a
news conference after the talks, which kicked off a day earlier at a resort in
Taoyuan County near Taipei.</P>
      <P>The "early harvest lists" refer to lists of goods and services that will enjoy
preferential or zero tariffs in future cross-Taiwan Strait trade -- a critical
part of the ECFA.</P>
      <P>"In the talks, we tried to get what we wanted and keep what we wanted to keep, "
he said, adding that the Chinese side agreed not to include an opening of
Chinese labor and more agricultural products on its "early harvest list" so as
not to impact Taiwan's small businesses.</P>
      <P>According  to Liang,  progress was made in this round of negotiations as the two
sides forged common ground on the "early harvest lists" and on the text of the
planned ECFA, as well as on regulations on the labeling of product origin.</P>
      <P>"Both agreed to make the most practical  and professional arrangements by fully
considering the characteristics of cross-strait trade," he said.</P>
      <P>Huang Chih-peng, director-general of the Bureau of Foreign Trade and Taiwan's
chief delegate at the talks, said both sides held comprehensive discussions and
exchanged opinions on the listed items.</P>
      <P>He also urged China to consider  allowing  some Taiwanese agricultural  and
fishing exports to enter the Chinese market duty-free and the Chinese delegates
promised to study the issue after returning home.</P>
      <P>The Taipei-based Straits Exchange Foundation, which organized the just-concluded
talks along with its Chinese counterpart,  the Association for Relations Across
the Taiwan Straits, said both sides agreed to step up the pace in clinching an
ECFA and to hold a third round of negotiations in China. The first round of
talks was held in Beijing in January.</P>
      <P>Tang Wei, head of the Department of Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau under China's
Ministry of Commerce, who led the Chinese delegation at the negotiations, said
that "we have not reached a final agreement on the `early harvest program'"  and
that "we will continue our discussions in the next round of negotiations."</P>
      <P>"The two sides have conducted negotiations on the opening of a small number of
listed items and a few industries, " he pointed out. But he added "the situation
between Taiwan and China means we are still far from practicing liberalized
trade."</P>
      <P>Echoing Liang's view, Tang, however, added that "unlimited communication and
exchanges of ideas have helped us forge common ground and make noticeable
progress."</P>
      <P>"China will do its best to mitigate the impact of the ECFA on Taiwan's
vulnerable industries and grassroots people," he went on.</P>
      <P>"We fully understand that the sizes and competitiveness of industries on both
sides must be taken into account when negotiating the final `early harvest
lists,'" he said.</P>

      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairwoman Lai Shin-yuan expressed optimism
Thursday about the prospects for signing a proposed wide-reaching trade pact
with China in June as scheduled.</P>
      <P>In a press statement issued by the Cabinet-level council at the end of a second
round of cross-Taiwan Strait talks on the economic cooperation framework
agreement (ECFA), Lai said the significance of the just-concluded negotiations
lies in ensuring that no sector will fall victim to the ECFA deal.</P>
      <P>More strenuous efforts will be made in future rounds of talks to clearly specify
the sectors that will benefit from the deal, Lai said in the statement.</P>
      <P>She further said the talks gave form to what the government has promised over
the past year -- that the "early harvest" program that forms the backbone of the
ECFA will not include any agricultural items that Taiwan does not import from
China at present, or traditionally domestic demand-oriented industries that are
sensitive to market changes.</P>
      <P>The two sides have also reached consensus that China will not ask Taiwan to open
its doors to Chinese workers, Lai added.</P>
      <P>The second round of ECFA talks began Wednesday at Ta Shee Resort in northern
Taiwan and concluded at noon Thursday, half a day earlier than originally
scheduled.</P>

      <P>A Taiwanese fishing boat that has not been in contact for days might have been
taken by Somali pirates, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a pres release
late Thursday.</P>
      <P>The ministry said that it was informed by the Fishery Agency under the Council
of Agriculture and the Coast Guard Administration earlier in the day that the
Zechuhtsai, a long-line fishing boat, had not made contact since the afternoon
of March 30.</P>
      <P>At the time of the last contact, the Zechuhtsai was around 395 nautical miles
southeast of Somalia's Cape Guardafui, where another Taiwanese long-liner, the
Juimanfa, was later attacked and chased by Somali pirates.</P>
      <P>Pirates from cutters released from a bigger boat disguised as a Taiwanese vessel
fired 60 to 80 rounds at the Juimanfa in the early hours of Thursday, injuring
an Indonesian crewman.</P>
      <P>The Juimanfa managed to escape to safety after being chased by the cutters for
three hours. As of press time, it was headed toward the Maldives to seek medical
assistance for the injured man.</P>
      <P>The ministry said that it has called on the International Maritime Bureau's
Piracy Reporting Center and the Bahrain liaison office  of the U.S.  Fifth Fleet
Command,  as well as other international anti-piracy organizations, to help
search for and rescue the missing Taiwan fishing boat.</P>
      <P>Another Taiwanese boat, the Win Far No. 161 was released in early February after
its owner paid an undisclosed amount of ransom to the Somali pirates who
kidnapped the ship and held its crew captive since April 6 last year.</P>

      <P>Eight Taiwanese citizens have applied to take part in a space journey at a cost

      <P>Virgin Galactic,  a space tourism operator affiliated with billionaire Richard
Branson's London-based Virgin Group,  which launched the travel plan initiative,
has collected fares from more than 330 aspiring amateur astronauts who are
willing to spend big money to experience about six minutes of suborbital
spaceflight, according to Royal China Express, the Taiwan agent for Virgin
Galactic.</P>

China, before the end of April.</P>
      <P>The debate might not sort out their differences and produce a consensus, but it
will be the first step for people of different views to discuss their opinions
sensitively rather than calling each other names.</P>
      <P>Opinion polls conducted by this newspaper have shown that more than 67 percent
of the respondents and 90 percent of the DPP followers are looking forward to
the debate, which has driven home to the leaders of the government and the DPP
the necessity for such a debate.</P>
      <P>Although it is us who initiated the debate first, we welcome the idea of having
the Taiwan Broadcasting System organize it in light of the fact that the system
has experience in staging debates among candidates in various elections.</P>
      <P>However, the debate on ECFA will be different from the candidate debates because
it involves many economic issues that might not be known to the layman.</P>
      <P>The mass media, which is supposed to cover the debate, should prime itself for
the debate by learning about the relevant issues and should make judgments based
on reason rather than on political ideology.</P>
      <P>Scholars can help ensure the success of the debate by questioning the debaters'
views during the debate and offering their comments afterward.</P>
      <P>We also hope the general public, regardless of their stance on the issue, will
support the debate and scrutinize the views presented by both sides. They should
at least learn the other side's opinions even they do not agree with them.</P>
      <P>We can forecast that the debate will not stymie Ma's plan to conclude the pact
with China in June, but this will not make much difference, because the pact is
only a framework agreement to be fleshed out in subsequent talks.</P>
      <P>The debate, however, might expose some shortcomings in the government's proposal
and should be addressed before the inking of the pact.</P>
      <P>By the same token, the debate will not stop the DPP from pushing for a
referendum to kill the pact, but it will help the party to judge a policy by its
merits rather than by the party's political conviction favoring Taiwan
independence.</P>
      <P>Given Ma's and Tsai's education backgrounds and their gentle manners, their
debate will not be a fierce one rife with bad language -- as is often in debates
between candidates -- and therefore it will set an example of sensitive
discussion for local politicians.  (April 2, 2010)</P>

    <HEADLINE>Commercial Times: Regrets about ECFA talks</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>04/02/10  12:29:36
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The second round of cross-Taiwan Strait talks on the proposed economic
cooperation framework cooperation (ECFA) concluded Thursday. The most
regrettable part of the talks was their failure to include the financial
services and the flat panel (TFT-LCD) industries in the negotiations of "early
harvest" items that will enjoy immediate tariff concessions or waivers under the
agreement.</P>
      <P>While financial services are the most important part of Taiwan's services
sector, the TFT-LCD industry is the most essential in Taiwan's manufacturing
sector. If these two issues are not given priority in negotiations with China,
what are Taiwan's substantive benefits in signing the ECFA?</P>
      <P>The government has told the public that obtaining the "early harvest" status
would exempt the financial services sector from restrictions set by China on
foreign financial institutions, thus clearing the way for their access to the
Chinese market.</P>
      <P>However, not only were financial services excluded from the just-concluded
talks, there are also uncertainties as to whether this issue will be covered in
the next round of talks.</P>
      <P>At present, large-area display panels from Taiwan are subject to import duties
of 3 percent-5 percent in China. If the products are granted tariff concessions,
Taiwan will obtain an absolute edge when competing with Japan and South Korea.
Furthermore, Taiwan's flat panel industry is China's best partner, with Taiwan
focusing on the upstream and China on the downstream. Reducing the tariffs on
Taiwan's flat panels is fully consistent with China's interests.</P>
      <P>The Chinese negotiators said they expected the two sides to reach consensus on
the ECFA soon, based on the principles of "rapidity, ease and small number."
Excluding the two issues from the talks was indeed in line with these
principles. The question is: Will the Taiwanese people be satisfied with an ECFA
like this? (April 2, 2010)</P>

    <HEADLINE>Talk of the day -- ECFA talks end with less-than-expected results</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>04/02/10  13:18:35
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The two sides of the Taiwan Strait wrapped up their second round of talks on a
proposed cross-strait economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) Thursday,
a half-day earlier than scheduled, at a resort in Taoyuan County, northern
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The two sides had been expected to exchange "early harvest lists" -- which are
expected to form the backbone of the agreement -- in the two-day talks, to
enable the sealing of the deal in June. However, this did not happen.</P>
      <P>Under a "fast, easy and less" principle for the talks on the much-anticipated
"early harvest" items,  the two sides reached consensus that the "early harvest"
program will not include any agricultural items that Taiwan does not import from
China at present, or traditionally  domestic demand-oriented  industries that
are sensitive to market changes, according to Taiwan's Cabinet-level Mainland
Affairs Council (MAC).</P>
      <P>The two sides have also reached consensus that China will not ask Taiwan to open
its doors to Chinese workers, said MAC Chairwoman Lai Shin-yuan, while
expressing optimism the prospects for the signing of the ECFA in June as
scheduled.</P>
      <P>Some local media, however, appear less optimistic than Lai.</P>
      <P>The "early harvest" program refers to lists of goods and services that will be
subject to immediate tariff concessions or exemptions in future cross-Taiwan
Strait trade -- a critical part of the ECFA.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has reportedly listed 500 items on its "early harvest" list.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from local media coverage of the issue:</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>Relevant government sources have disclosed that Taiwan's "early harvest" list
will likely be cut shorter to include just 350 items, at least 300 of which are
products that Taiwan insists should be essential items for inclusion on the
list.</P>
      <P>It is certain that the flat panel sector will not be included in the "early
harvest" program. Officials have revealed that the reasons for the exclusion are
that Taiwan does not want the sector to edge other industries out of the program
because Taiwan exports an enormous amount of flat panels to China every year.</P>
      <P>In addition, the sector is not a major competitor with the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) regarding sales to the vast Chinese market, the
officials said.</P>
      <P>Products from the petrochemical, textile and machinery industries -- which face
an immediate threat from ASEAN competitors after China and the regional economic
bloc began their free trade exchanges this year -- are the items that need
China's preferential tariff treatment most urgently, they added.</P>
      <P>Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>The second round of ECFA talks were frayed at the end, despite wide expectations
that the negotiations on the "early harvest" lists would be completed smoothly.</P>
      <P>The breakdown was attributed to the fact that the two sides shared little
consensus on the "less-competitive sectors" they want to protect, as well as the
fact that Taiwan demanded a bigger tax drop on its farming and fishery exports
to China.</P>
      <P>Tang Wei, head of the Department of Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau under China's
Ministry of Commerce, said China also has many weaker businesses that require
protection.</P>
      <P>Eventually, the China side only agreed to "do its utmost not to affect" Taiwan's
weaker industries and small- and medium-sized enterprises.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union Chairman Huang Kuen-Huei blasted
the administration of President Ma Ying-jeou for having never reported bad news
regarding the ECFA talks.</P>
      <P>Huang said that in the ECFA negotiations, which began in Beijing in January,
only Taiwan's "early harvest" list has ever been talked about, but not China's
list, which in other words is an "early damage" list for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>While many industries appear to be "waiting in fear" amid the talks, he strongly
urged the government to immediately make public China's "early damage" list.</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>Countries in the Asia-Pacific region have been closely monitoring the latest
changes in the ECFA talks.</P>
      <P>According to high-ranking officials, they anticipate that if the TWO sides sign
the trade pact in June as scheduled, it will help Taiwan recover free trade
agreement talks with Singapore. In the meantime, it will also help Taiwan to
start trade talks with Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines. (April 2, 2010)</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taipei city government opened recycling stations for expired medications at
219 community and hospital pharmacies Friday as part of its efforts to prevent
discarded drugs and medical products from polluting the environment.</P>
      <P>According to the results of a recent survey conducted by a national association
of pharmacists, 61.5 percent of the respondents said they usually dispose of
unused or expired drugs in the trash, 4.3 percent said they flush expired drugs
down the toilet, 2.9 percent said they give the drugs to friends or relatives,
and only 16.2 percent said they take the items to pharmacies, hospitals or
clinics for recycling.</P>
      <P>Citing the findings of field surveys by local academics, Chiu Wen-hsiang,
director of the city government's Department of Health, said trace amounts of
antibiotics in the Dahan and Sindian rivers in northern Taiwan exceed
permissible levels set by the European Union 7,500 fold, probably because of the
habit of flushing unused or expired drugs down the toilet, or high trace amounts
in human excreta.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, Chiu said, the department has installed recycling
stations in community drug stores and hospital pharmacies to collect expired or
unused solid and liquid medications, syringes and needles, medication packaging
and bottles. The city government's Environmental Protection Bureau will be in
charge of subsequent cleanup and treatment of the waste, he added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Finance Minister Lee Sush-der is a fool sui generis, so it is little wonder he
was the Cabinet member ridiculed most by Web users on April Fools' Day.</P>
      <P>In order to dampen the overheated  real estate market as instructed by Premier
Wu Den-yih, Lee suggested replacing the current flat housing tax with a
progressive one. However, the premier called it off out of concern that it might
drive away voters in the year-end special municipality elections.</P>
      <P>It was a slap in the face for Lee, which the minister took lying down. He even
went to the defense of the premier's abrupt reversal in policy by claiming that
the premier did what had to be done, as if it were not his suggestion to make
the changes.</P>
      <P>He even described the premier as a scapegoat, saying that he felt hurt by
critics' groundless criticism of the premier.</P>
      <P>In a defense of the government policy of offering the lion's share of
government's revenues to the five municipalities to be formed by the end of this
year, the minister, in a derogatory manner, likened the other counties as
kindergarten pupils who cannot be expected to be treated the same as graduate
school students.</P>
      <P>When a lawmaker suggested, tongue in cheek, that he should revise the law to
withhold financial aid to counties that oppose the proposed trade pact with
China or criticize Taipei City wrongfully for failing to pay health insurance
premiums, the minister's response of "you said it" showed his complete agreement
with a comment that he failed to comprehend was made in jest.</P>
      <P>If the minister can starve opposition-controlled counties of financial aid,
would this not violate the Constitution? Both the lawmaker and the minister are
idiots.</P>
      <P>Lee feels content with his own performance, anyway. He claimed a couple of days
ago that Taiwan's finances are in perfect shape, in defiance of the fact that
Standard &amp; Poor has downgraded Taiwan's sovereign rate because of its
massive debts. What a joke the minister is. (April 2, 2010)</P>

      <P>A spokesman for the Office of the President called the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) hypocritical Friday for pushing for a referendum to
quash the government's proposed Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement (ECFA)
with China.</P>
      <P>Lo Chih-chiang noted that the DPP did not bother to put any of the five free
trade agreements the country concluded with other states to a referendum during
the eight years it was in power.</P>
      <P>"Why should it now ask for a referendum on ECFA, which is the same kind of
thing?" Lo asked.</P>
      <P>He made the statement in response to remarks by DPP Secretary- General Su Jia-
chyuan, who claimed the previous day that the Kuomintang administration should
step down if it refuses to hold a referendum on the trade pact that the DPP
believes would undermine Taiwan's sovereignty.</P>
      <P>"There are more than 200 free trade pacts or similar agreements around the
world, the majority of which were not put to referendum. Should all the
administrations that signed these pacts be defined as undemocratic and step
down?" Lo asked.</P>
      <P>Naming the United States, Japan and South Korea as a few nations that have
entered such pacts without seeking approval through referendum, Lo asked
rhetorically: "Should they be characterized as non-democratic?"</P>
      <P>It is highly unlikely that the DPP would be unaware of the importance of the
trade pact with China, and as a responsible opposition, the DPP should tell the
public how Taiwan can avoid being isolated as regional trade blocs continue to
sprout up around the world, Lo said.</P>
      <P>He urged the DPP not to try to keep the country isolated from the rest of the
world, as this would only harm Taiwan's economy.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou's administration is working hard to clinch the pact in
June, while the DPP is making every effort to block it.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Timing not right for child-rearing subsidies: MOI</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 2 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of the Interior (MOI) denied Friday that it is planning to issue a
monthly subsidy of NT$5,000 for children aged 0-3 in a bid to boost the
country's declining birth rate.</P>
      <P>In a statement issued in response to a media report, the MOI said that it is not
a good time to launch a child-rearing subsidy program, given the country's tight
fiscal situation.</P>
      <P>The MOI said that it is considering various programs -- including the one
mentioned above -- as part of the country's long-term population policy, but it
has not made a final decision on what approach to take.</P>
      <P>According to a front-page story in the China Times, the monthly NT$5,000 subsidy
program, which would include children of wealthy families, would cost the
government NT$36.9 billion a year. It would run parallel to the existing monthly
NT$3,000 babysitting subsidy for households in which both parents are working
and earn less than NT$1.5 million a year, the report stated.</P>
      <P>However, the MOI said although experts have suggested that the child-rearing
subsidy program should cover all households regardless of their income levels,
in the interest of fairness the ministry would prefer to exclude wealthy
households.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the issue Friday, lawmakers across party lines said the subsidy
program would be too narrow if it covered only children aged 0-3.</P>
      <P>Legislator Ho Tsai-feng of the ruling Kuomintang proposed that all children
under six should be included, while Yeh Yi-jin of the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party suggested that the subsidy should be extended to all children
under 12.</P>
      <P>There are approximately 2.8 million children under 12 in Taiwan, accounting for
12.14 percent of the country's total population, Yeh noted. However, government
spending on child welfare totals only NT$5 billion a year -- less than 1 percent
of the total budget, she said.</P>
      <P>According to Yeh, the government should offer a subsidy of NT$12,000 per child
per year. She said this amount would be affordable to the government because it
would only cost NT$33.6 billion a year in total, or just 1.9 percent of the
government's annual expenditure.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's high-speed railway does not face a safety threat even though a six-
kilometer section that cuts through Yunlin County sits on land that has subsided
considerably in recent years, transport officials said Friday.</P>
      <P>The site where the elevated railway crosses over Provincial Expressway No. 78 in
the central-south county has subsided the most, sinking 55 centimeters over the
past seven years, according to data compiled by Taiwan High-Speed Rail Corp.
(THSRC), which operates the bullet train.</P>
      <P>Officials of the Bureau of Taiwan High Speed Rail under the Ministry of
Transportation and Communications (MOTC) said, however, that the "differential
settlement" -- the rate of uneven settling -- between adjacent piers of the
railway viaduct in Yunlin remains within tolerable levels, and they stressed
that the railway's structure and operation remained safe.</P>
      <P>According to the officials, the THSRC has closely monitored the subsidence of
the Yunlin section's pier and foundation since 2004.</P>
      <P>The differential  settlement for the section crossing over Provincial Expressway
No. 78 stands at 1.08/1,500 at present, far lower than the maximum permissible
level of 6/1,500, the officials said.</P>
      <P>They added that the pace of subsidence along the Yunlin section had slowed from
nearly 10 cm per year in the past to 6.8 cm last year because a number of deep
wells were closed in the area, reducing the use of groundwater.</P>
      <P>Though pleased by the slower pace of settlement, the bureau said it hopes the
central and local governments will collaborate to close even more water wells,

      <P>The  Chinese  delegation  to the just-concluded  second round of talks on a
proposed framework agreement on trade between Taiwan and China headed home
Friday.</P>
      <P>Tang Wei, head of the Department of Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao Affairs under
China's Ministry  of Commerce  and China's lead negotiator at the talks,
maintained a low profile and did not make any public comments prior to his
departure.</P>
      <P>Asked whether any concrete results were achieved at the talks, Tang only gave a
polite "thank you all" response.</P>
      <P>To avoid encountering pro-independence or anti-China protesters at Taiwan
Taoyuan International Airport, the Chinese delegation arrived at the airport two
hours before their flight's departure time.</P>
      <P>According to Taoyuan police authorities, the Chinese delegation toured a tourism
dairy farm in Taoyuan County's Yangmei Township on Friday morning to relax
before heading to the airport. Many Chinese negotiators were reportedly visiting
Taiwan for the first time.</P>
      <P>The second round of ECFA talks began Wednesday at Ta Shee Resort in Taoyuan
County, some 40 kilometers south of Taipei, and concluded at noon Thursday, half
a day earlier than originally scheduled.</P>
      <P>At the end of the talks,  Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairwoman Lai Shin-
yuan expressed optimism Thursday about the prospects for signing the wide-
reaching trade pact with China in June as scheduled.</P>
      <P>Lai said  in a statement  that  the significance  of the just-concluded
negotiations lies in ensuring that no sector will fall victim to the ECFA deal.</P>
      <P>More strenuous efforts will be made in future rounds of talks to clearly specify
the sectors that will benefit from the deal, Lai said in the statement.</P>
      <P>She further said the talks gave form to what the government has promised over
the past year -- that the "early harvest" program, a list of items for which
duties will be reduced  or exempted immediately, will not include any
agricultural items that Taiwan does not import from China at present.</P>
      <P>It would also not include conventional domestic demand-oriented industries that
would be sensitive to new inflows of Chinese goods.</P>
      <P>The two sides have also reached a consensus that China will not ask Taiwan to
open its doors to Chinese workers, Lai added.</P>

      <P>Vice Premier Eric Liluan Chu stressed the importance of execution, safety and
quality Friday when inspecting construction work related to a planned aviation
park in northern Taiwan's Taoyuan County.</P>
      <P>Chu heard briefings by officials about the improvement work being carried out at
Terminal One of Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport and about the ongoing
construction of the Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) system's Linkou line linking Taipei
with the country's largest airport.</P>
      <P>According to Transportation Ministry officials, the renovation of the airport's
shabby terminal is slated for completion in 2011, while construction of the
MRT's Linkou line, now 41 percent complete instead of the 28 percent that had
been originally projected, is also slated to wrap up in 2012.</P>
      <P>Taipei Magistrate Chou Hsi-wei accompanied  Chu during the inspection of a
construction site on the Linkou line and both expressed hope that completion of
the line will boost development in the areas adjacent to the airport.</P>
      <P>It was their first encounter since Chou forswore his bid to seek a second term
as magistrate in late February at a time when Chu was widely reported as the
favored candidate to be picked by the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) to run in the
year-end mayoral elections in Xinbei City (upgraded  from Taipei County  into
one of five special municipalities).</P>
      <P>However, Chu was reluctant to answer reporters' questions related to the
election campaign, while Chou explained that relevant issues will be made public
after the KMT officially fields Chu as its candidate.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile that day, Lin Chia-long of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) , who is seeking the party's nomination to take part in the mayoral race
in Taichung, said he will continue moving toward his goal despite reports that
the party's Frank Hsieh, a former premier, wants to run there.</P>
      <P>Incumbent Taichung Mayor Jason Hu, a heavyweight of the ruling Kuomintang (KMT)
who has made known his intention to vie for the post of Taichung mayor, declined
to comment on the speculation.</P>
      <P>"This is a matter for the DPP and I am not in a position to talk about it," he
said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Reported cases of child abuse increased by about 30 percent between 2005 and
2009, according to statistics from the government and the Taiwan Fund for
Children and Families (TFCF) , a fund executive said Friday, ahead of the April
4 Children's Day.</P>
      <P>The number of child abuse cases reached 13,400 in 2009, 35 percent more than in
2005. Most victims were elementary school children improperly disciplined by
their parents, TFCF CEO Wang Ming-ren said, citing statistics compiled by the
Ministry of the Interior.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 3,177 abused children and juveniles sought TFCF's protection last
year, an increase of 29 percent from 2005, according to the organization.</P>
      <P>Of the 3,177 cases, 87.95 percent involved children abused by their own parents,
with parents in the 30- to 39-year-old age bracket the main perpetrators,
accounting for 30.14 percent of the cases, TFCF statistics show.</P>
      <P>Children between nine and 11 years old were the most frequent victims of abuse,
accounting for 23.29 percent of the cases, with those in the six- to eight-year-
old group accounting for 21.47 percent, according to the statistics.</P>
      <P>Evidence showed that parents torn between the demands of the workplace and the
family tended to be rougher when disciplining young children, Wang said.</P>
      <P>Pointing to a recent criminal case in which a girl in Pingtung County is
suspected of colluding with her boyfriend to murder her father after being
subject to long-term abuse, Wang said that if police and social services groups
could have intervened earlier, the tragedy could have been prevented.</P>
      <P>There are many parenting problems involved in child abuse cases, such as lack of
parenting skills, negligence and overly strict parenting, Wang said.</P>
      <P>He also said parents who are inclined to improperly discipline their children
are often overly demanding, alcoholic or have anger management problems.</P>
      <P>To promote healthy relationships and intimate interaction between young children
and their parents, the TFCF has developed a set of playful body movements that
parents can perform with young children, Wang said.</P>

      <P>Student teams from two Taiwanese universities won all 18 medals in the six
categories of a recent international mini-robot competition in Japan.</P>
      <P>A five-member team from Minhsin University of Science and Technology (MUST)
brought home five gold, one silver, and four bronze medals and seven special
awards for their 2-cm3 mini-robot designs.</P>
      <P>The two students on the team from National Kaohsiung University of Applied
Sciences (KUAS) and its sister university Harbin Institute of Technology in
China, bagged one gold, five silver and two bronze medals and one special award.</P>
      <P>The participants in the 4th International Micro-Mechanisms Contest that opened
in Tokyo March 17 competed in three main categories, each of which featured
manipulation of mini-robots by wire and wireless control. The competing teams
were required to manipulate the mini-robots in barrier climbing, sumo wrestling,
and dice operation.</P>
      <P>The U.S., Japan, Thailand and other countries entered a total of more than 250
mini robots in the competition, which was organized by the Japan Society for
Precision Engineering.</P>
      <P>The 20 mini-robots developed by the MUST team won five of the six gold medals in
the competition and took the top three prizes in category of dice operation with
wireless control. Last year, the university also bagged five gold medals in the
contest.</P>
      <P>The KUAS team, which entered 15 robots in the 2010 competition, achieved its
best performance in the category of sumo wrestling with wireless control,
winning a gold and a silver medal.</P>
      <P>Pan Tien-tzu, a KUAS assistant professor who led the Taiwan delegation to Japan,
said it was the first time that universities across the Taiwan Strait had sent a
joint team to the competition.</P>
      <P>Lin Chih-sheng of KUAS, who was participating in the contest for the third time,
said that he and his Chinese teammate faced a lot of pressure because most of
the other competitors showed more speed than in previous years.</P>
      <P>Taiwan  has  been  excelling  in  mini-robot  competitions internationally in
the past few years, with the support of the Ministry of Education and the
National Science Council, said Pan, who had led the Dayeh University team that

      <P>What jobs do Taiwanese children want the most when they grow up? According to a
survey released Friday ahead of the April 4 Children's Day, they want to be
singers and actors.</P>
      <P>The survey, conducted by Mandarin Daily News, found that doctors were the
second-most popular profession among children, followed by computer engineers.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the three most unpopular professions were morticians, explosion
stuntmen and farmers.</P>
      <P>Also on the unpopular job list was president, which took fifth place. Many
respondents said that becoming president would make them an easy target of
public protests and that the job was too stressful and tiresome, though it
offered high pay.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted in March among 1,588 fifth and sixth graders from 48
schools around the country. It had a margin of error of plus or minus 2.46
percent.</P>
      <P>According  to Feng Yen,  a professor  at National  Taiwan University's
Department of Social Work, the fact that show business was so attractive to the
younger generation demonstrated that children are affected more by media and
social influences than by their families or schools.</P>
      <P>"They see only the pompous appearances but fail to see the hard work behind it,"
Feng said.</P>
      <P>She advised parents not to allow their children to spend too much time watching
TV or using the Internet to keep the media from taking their place in raising
their children.</P>
      <P>Feng also expressed concern over results that suggested children prefer jobs
that offer high pay and little work.</P>
      <P>She presumed that if hi-tech professionals, entrepreneurs and business owners
were among the options provided in the survey, many children probably would have
chosen them.</P>
      <P>The survey results show that the top considerations in choosing professions
among the children were pay, stability and whether they are interesting.</P>
      <P>The most common reasons mentioned by the children for avoiding certain
professions were that the jobs are strenuous, dangerous or unstable, or that the
jobs do not interest them.</P>
      <P>The study  found obvious  gender  differences  in choosing professions.</P>
      <P>Among boys, the top five professions were computer engineers, baseball players,
athletes, policemen and doctors.</P>
      <P>The top five among girls were singers or actresses, fashion designers, teachers,
beauticians and pastry chefs.</P>

      <P>Malaysia's trade minister has suggested that the signing of a cross-Taiwan
Strait framework agreement on trade would be conducive to Taiwan and Malaysia
reaching a free trade agreement (FTA) , Taiwan's economics minister Shih Yen-
shiang said Friday.</P>
      <P>Shih said that he met with Malaysia's minister of International Trade and
Industry, Mustapa Mohamed, on the sidelines of a bilateral trade and economic
conference being held in Kuala Lumpur, and expressed Taiwan's willingness to
sign an FTA with Malaysia.</P>
      <P>Mustapa responded by showing interest in the progress of the trade talks, and he
told the Taiwanese official that its completion would help Taiwan and Malaysia
reach their own deal, according to Shih.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's government has argued that a key benefit of signing the economic
cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) with China was that it would open the way
for negotiations on FTAs with other countries, which China currently blocks.</P>
      <P>The administration is worried that without trade deals in place with other
countries or economic zones, Taiwan's export-dependent economy would be
marginalized by regional trade blocs, especially in Asia.</P>
      <P>It contends that once China signs the ECFA with Taiwan, other countries will be
less concerned that concluding a trade deal with Taiwan would offend Beijing.</P>
      <P>Critics contend, however, that China is an unreliable partner and that even if a
framework agreement is signed, it would continue to interfere with Taiwan's free
trade initiatives around the world and put pressure on potential trade pact
partners.</P>
      <P>The holding of the meeting and Shih's presence may both be indications, however,
that Taiwan's closer ties with China have helped improve ties with other
countries in the region.</P>
      <P>It was the first time in eight years that a Taiwanese minister was in Kuala
Lumpur to attend the ministerial-level conference and the first time the
conference was held since the sixth Taiwan-Malaysian trade and economic meeting
took place in Taipei in 2004.</P>
      <P>The conference had been suspended since then due to Malaysian concerns about
angering China.</P>
      <P>Also at the bilateral  consultative  conference,  Taiwanese representatives
expressed hope that Malaysia could offer visa-free treatment to Taiwanese
passport holders, and Malaysian officials responded that they would study and
evaluate the issue, according to Shih.</P>
      <P>In addition, Taiwan's Institute for Information Industry signed a memorandum of
understanding with Malaysia's Multimedia Development Corporation, the economics
minister said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is Malaysia's fifth major investment destination in the world, while
Malaysia is one of Taiwan's top investment destinations in Southeast Asia.</P>
      <P>During the trip, which began Wednesday and ended Friday, Shih also visited
Taiwanese businesses with investments in the country.</P>
      <P>One company promised to have its shares listed on Taiwan's over-the-counter
market in response to the government's call for overseas Taiwanese businesses to
return and invest in their home country, Shih said.</P>

      <P>Global smartphone designer HTC announced the launch of the HTC Smart in Taiwan
Friday and expected sales of the 3G smartphone to reach 1 million worldwide in
three to four months.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, the HTC Smart will be sold exclusively by Chunghwa Telecom Co. at a
price of NT$7,900 (US$249) -- about 12 percent higher than its debut price in
India of around NT$7,050. It is expected to be on the market by mid-April.</P>
      <P>Peter Chou, chief executive officer of HTC, said at a press conference that the
smartphone, which was first unveiled at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in
Las Vegas in January, is expected to enter the China market in May.</P>
      <P>Chunghwa Telecom Chairman Lu Shyue-ching said the company plans to buy 600,000
smartphones this year, or around 25 to 30 percent of the total 2 million mobile
phones to be purchased this year, up from 10 to 25 percent in its previous
forecast.</P>
      <P>Lu said that a smartphone under NT$8,000 will be attractive to younger buyers,
and that he believes the sales of the smartphone will rise quickly if the
telecom service rates can be pushed lower.</P>
      <P>The HTC Smart is the first HTC device based on Qualcomm's Brew platform, unlike
most HTC products, which run on either Google's Android OS or Windows Mobile.</P>
      <P>Paul Jacobs, chief executive officer of Qualcomm Inc., said that several telecom
service providers in the U.S. -- such as AT&amp;T and Sprint -- also expressed
interests in future cooperation with the HTC Smart.</P>
      <P>HTC shares were not helped by the news, closing at NT$375, down NT$1.0 from
Thursday.</P>
      <P>The HTC Smart boasts a 2.8-inch TFT-LCD touch-sensitive screen and includes a
3.0 megapixel camera. With the supported widgets, users can customize their
device for quick access to contacts, photos, music and weather reports.</P>
      <P>The smartphone also includes a new application that enables users to easily
check status updates of friends across various social networking sites.</P>

      <P>The Executive Yuan should form a cross-agency task force to tackle land
subsidence in Yunlin County so that it does not imperil the safety of the
section of high-speed railway that passes through the county, some lawmakers
said Friday.</P>
      <P>The subsidence,  caused mainly by the heavy extraction of groundwater in the
agricultural region,  has been particularly pronounced at certain points along
the bullet train line in Yunlin County.</P>
      <P>The ground where the elevated railway passes over Provincial Expressway No. 78
has subsided 55 centimeters over the past seven years, according to data from
the line's operator, Taiwan High Speed Rail Corporation (THSRC), raising
potential safety concerns.</P>
      <P>The Water Resources Agency (WRA) issued a directive recently to seal off 1,115
shallow wells near the problem areas to limit subsidence, but it was rejected by
the opposition-controlled Yunlin County government, which complained it would
hurt farmers' interests.</P>
      <P>Yunlin County Magistrate Su Chih-fen, who refused to follow the WRA's directive
without suitable complementary measures, argued that the measure would do little
to mitigate the problem because the subsidence was mainly caused by deep wells
that had all been sealed off years ago.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lin echoed Su's views, saying that well closings and high-speed
railway safety involve many complex issues that require the collaboration of
various government agencies.</P>
      <P>"We hope the Executive Yuan will form an interministerial task force to work out
a comprehensive package of measures to resolve the contentious problems," Lin
said.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Hsu Shu-po suggested that the Council for Economic Planning and
Development devise a program to have the government take over the plots of land
where wells are sealed and use them for the development of the solar energy
industry.</P>
      <P>Though efforts are being made to confront the problem, THSRC has insisted that
the high-speed rail is safe. It said that the differential settlement -- the
rate of uneven settling -- between adjacent piers of the railway viaduct
remained within tolerable levels and that the line was structurally sound.</P>
      <P>But the company and central government agencies would prefer that the shallow
wells along the railway be closed off to prevent the subsidence from getting
worse and possibly affecting the rail line's long-term safety.</P>
      <P>Chen Chao-cheng, a WRA section chief, said that of Yunlin County's 110,000 water
wells, 98 percent have been dug illegally. Up to 1,000 of the 1,115 wells that
the WRA wants to seal off were dug without its prior approval.</P>
      <P>The WRA, Chen said, would offer owners of legal wells subsidies to shut down
wells and would also provide relief funds to those who had dug wells illegally.</P>
      <P>Wei Li-chih, deputy director of Taiwan's Forestry Bureau under the Council of
Agriculture, added that the bureau will offer NT$2.4 million for forestation of
the sites where wells are sealed.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Department of Health (DOH) Minister Yaung Chih-liang said Friday that premium
rates for a second-generation National Health Insurance (NHI) program based on
total household income will be between 3 percent and 4 percent.</P>
      <P>He also said the plan will be similar to the system for paying taxes, with
health insurance premiums deducted at the origin of income. Every year those
insured will receive a refund or be charged additional money for the previous
year.</P>
      <P>Under the new program, total household income will be defined as a tax
registration household, which means that people who file their tax reports
together will be counted as a household when establishing premiums, Yaung said.</P>
      <P>The DOH will send a proposal on the plan, which is expected to be introduced
within two years, to the Executive Yuan for review next week.</P>
      <P>Before the second-generation plan is introduced, a temporary plan, which took
effect on April 1, raised the health insurance premium rate from 4.55 percent to
5.17 percent of an individual's salary.</P>
      <P>As of the end of last year, the national health insurance program had
accumulated debts of NT$58.8 billion (US$1.84 billion), an amount that could
soar to an estimated NT$101.5 billion by the end of 2010 if no adjustments are

    <HEADLINE>Military, NTU team collaborate on trying to make rain</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 2 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's Air Force and a meteorological team from National Taiwan University
(NTU) , with help on the ground from the Water Resources Agency (WRA) , launched
an offensive Friday to try to induce rainfall in drought-plagued southern
Taiwan, according to a WRA official.</P>
      <P>A squad of C-130 transport aircraft Air Force released some 4,000 liters of
water from an altitude of 15,000 feet and targeted it at the water catchment
areas of the Tsengwen, Wushantou and Nanhua reservoirs in Tainan and Chiayi
counties, hoping to induce more rain in the region, WRA Deputy Director-General
Wu Yueh-si said.</P>
      <P>At the same time, an NTU team led by Department of Atmospheric Sciences
associate professor Lin Po-hsiung was trying to seed clouds to create rain over
the water catchment areas, Wu noted, but neither of the approaches produced
immediate results.</P>
      <P>Taiwan normally uses cold-cloud seeding, but on Friday the team opted for warm-
cloud seeding, where an aerosol, in this case calcium-chloride based, is sprayed
into clouds rather than above them.</P>
      <P>NTU'S Lin said there will be cold fronts approaching Taiwan in the coming days
and current weather conditions are suitable for making rain by using warm-cloud
seeding, used to generate rain in upper air cloud layers when their temperature
is above 10 degrees Celsius.</P>
      <P>Cold-cloud seeding, Lin said, is used when the temperature of those cloud layers
is below 10 degrees C.</P>
      <P>According to Wu, his agency will review Friday's operation and renew rain making
efforts early next week when weather fronts pass over Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The water supply across Taiwan is secure through the end of July, but the
situation in the greater Kaohsiung area is riskier, Wu explained.</P>
      <P>No rain has fallen in parts of southern Taiwan since Typhoon Morakot devastated
that part of the country last August. Spring rice planting in some areas of
central and southern Taiwan was suspended to save water.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Judges order Chen's family to return overseas money</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The possibility of releasing former President Chen Shui-bian on bail is slim if
the NT$700 million in his family's Swiss bank accounts isn't remitted to Taiwan,
the presiding judge in Chen's money laundering and corruption cases said Friday.</P>
      <P>At a Taiwan High Court collegial hearing, Teng Chen-chiu said Chen and his
family should return the money to an account designated by the Special
Investigation Division of the Prosecutor-General's Office if they wanted Chen to
have a chance of being released when his current detention period expires on
April 23.</P>
      <P>However, Chen's lawyer Cheng Wen-lung argued that Chen's son Chen Chih-chung and
daughter-in-law Huang Jui-ching have signed documents required to retrieve all
the money in overseas bank accounts, and that whether the funds can be returned
is beyond their control.</P>
      <P>Cheng said the collegial panel should not give an order that the defendants are
unable to fulfill.</P>
      <P>Cheng pointed out that a slush fund from the scandal-plagued Lafayette frigate
deal struck between Taiwan and France in the early 1990s is still frozen in a
Swiss bank account, adding that there are many reasons for the failure to return
overseas funds to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>For example, Taiwan's position on capital punishment could be a factor affecting
the return of overseas funds, Cheng said.</P>
      <P>After Teng reiterated that whether the funds are remitted would be taken into
consideration  when deciding  about  the former president's release, Chen Chih-
chung promised to collaborate with prosecutors to have the money returned.</P>
      <P>Former first lady Wu Shu-jen, however, expressed discontent over Chen's
detention, saying that the ex-president has been detained for more than 500 days
and that her family members have done their best to return the money.</P>
      <P>The panel is scheduled to conclude oral arguments on April 7 and make a ruling
on June 11.</P>
      <P>Also Friday, prosecutors sought to exempt the former first family's bookkeeper
Chen Chen-hui from punishment and from sharing in the repayment of NT$100
million in misappropriated funds with the Chens and two of her supervisors,
saying she should be given special treatment because she pleaded guilty.</P>
      <P>Three other defendants in the cases also pleaded guilty: Rich Group Chairman Kuo
Chuan-ching, who has been indicted for giving bribes to the former first family;
James Lee, former chief of the Hsinchu Science Park, who was indicted for
accepting NT$30 million in bribes in the sale of a plot of private land in
Lungtan, Taoyuan County; and a friend of the former first family, Tsai Ming-che,
who allegedly played the role of a go-between in the handling of bribes and
money laundering.</P>

      <P>The first debate on a proposed Taiwan-China economic cooperation framework
agreement (ECFA) will be televised April 5 by a local cable TV station.</P>
      <P>Huang Chih-peng, director-general of the Bureau of Foreign Trade, said that to
his knowledge, he will team up with Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator Lai Shyh-bao
against Chuang Suo-hang and Julian Kuo, both former lawmakers of the opposition
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), in the debate to be broadcast by CtiTV.</P>
      <P>"The debate slated for next Monday is a prelude  to the anticipated debate on
the ECFA between President Ma Ying-jeou and DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen," Huang
said.</P>
      <P>Huang was Taiwan's chief negotiator in the second round of cross-Taiwan Strait
negotiations on the ECFA, which wrapped up Thursday.</P>
      <P>Although no major breakthrough was made on the pact's "early harvest" lists,
which will include the items that will immediately benefit from tariff
reductions or exemptions, the two sides forged common ground on the text of the
planned ECFA, as well as on regulations covering the labeling of product origin.</P>
      <P>Delegates from the two sides promised that they will continue negotiations in
the next round of talks in China in May or June and hoped that the ECFA could be
clinched by that time.</P>
      <P>The DPP is strongly opposed to the pact, fearing that an influx of cheap Chinese
goods could hurt local companies and that it would undermine Taiwan's
sovereignty.</P>
      <P>The president said Friday that Taiwan and China will decide which items will be
listed in their "early harvest program" in the third round of ECFA talks.</P>
      <P>The major purpose of the trade deal with China is to set up an institutionalized
mechanism for cross-strait trade and to help Taiwan push for free trade
agreements (FTAs) with other countries and a role in East Asia's economic
integration, Ma said.</P>
      <P>"As China is Taiwan's largest trade partner, it is right to start by signing a
trade pact with China, " the president reiterated while meeting at the
Presidential Office with the delegation that will represent Taiwan at the Boao
Forum.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the possible impact of the ECFA on Taiwan's industries, Ma said
Taiwan would not engage in wishful thinking, and he realized that if cheap
Chinese goods entered Taiwan's market, they would have an adverse impact on
domestic demand-oriented sectors.</P>
      <P>"The Chinese side promised to do its best to avoid harming Taiwan's vulnerable
businesses when putting forth its early harvest list, " he said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Ma will attend a seminar in Yunlin County Saturday to explain  ECFA-
related  issues to local farmers.  Yunlin is an agricultural-based county in
central-south Taiwan where the DPP enjoys widespread support. A second ECFA
forum led by the president will be held in Kaohsiung April 10.</P>

    <HEADLINE>China Times: The finance minister's hurt feelings</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>04/03/10  14:36:15
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Finance Lee Sush-der's recent comments on central government revenue
allocations to local governments that oppose a cross-strait trade pact and his
defense of Premier Wu Den-yih have given the public a better understanding of
the limits of his intellect.</P>
      <P>Lee said his "feelings were hurt" when the public blamed Wu for his decision to
back off from the plan to increase house taxes.</P>
      <P>Even more surprising was his claim that "the finances of the Republic of China
are the best in the world." Not only local academics have rebutted his remarks.
Fitch Ratings also slashed Taiwan's sovereign rating to A from A+ last September
-- far behind Singapore's AAA, Hong Kong's AA and Australia's AA+.</P>
      <P>It is obvious Taiwan's financial structure is markedly worsening and the country
is facing a serious problem.</P>
      <P>By the end of 2009, international rating agencies estimated that debt accounted
for 38 percent of Taiwan's GDP. But that is only the tip of the iceberg. If
Taiwan's hidden debt were included in the calculation, the percentage would
surge to 157 percent of GDP.</P>
      <P>The deterioration in government finances is nothing new. It can be traced back
to the era of former President Chen Shui-bian, when many industries relocated
overseas. The main cause, however, was the government's large-scale tax
reduction over the past 20 years -- motivated solely by the desire to gain
votes.</P>
      <P>It is disappointing that President Ma Ying-jeou's administration keeps the cycle
going by continually coming out with tax-cut incentives without professional
debate or social consensus, further widening Taiwan's wealth gap and damaging
public confidence in the government.</P>
      <P>If Lee's feelings were really hurt, he should have felt a strong sadness because
of Taiwan's huge financial problem, rather than worry about his boss's feelings.

      <P>Demands by the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) to hold a
referendum on every issue related to China are illogical, Presidential Office
spokesman Lo Chih-chiang said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Lo questioned why the DPP as a ruling party decided to allow imports of 936
items of agricultural products from China without holding a referendum.</P>
      <P>DPP spokesman Lin Yu-chang said Saturday that the party advocated holding a
referendum before deciding whether to sign a proposed cross-strait economic
cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) because Taiwan's counterpart in the pact
would be Chinese Communists with the hostile intention of annexing Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the purpose of signing agreements like an ECFA is to help
Taiwanese businessmen boost business opportunities, Lo said that booming
business will help improve the economic environment and create more jobs.</P>
      <P>The DPP must not disregard people's livelihoods and the nation's economic
development by being adamant about its closed-door political ideology, Lo said.</P>
      <P>According to Lo, the Republic of China and North Korea are the only economies in
Asia without bilateral trade agreements with other Asian countries. Between 2000
and 2009, the free trade agreements signed by Asian countries increased from
three to 58, he added.</P>
      <P>While countries all over the world are seeking to sign bilateral trade
agreements with their major trading partners, Lo said, it is only reasonable for
Taiwan to sign a free trade agreement with its biggest trading partner -- China.</P>
      <P>Without free trade agreements with its Asian neighbors, Taiwan is not guaranteed
the best tariffs and exports to the United States, Japan, South Korea, mainland
China and Southeast Asian countries would face disadvantages, he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Talk of the day: Ex-president told to remit money to get release</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>04/03/10  15:33:36
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former President Chen Shui-bian, who has been in detention for more than 500
days for his involvement in money laundering and corruption cases, was told by a
judge Friday that he could be released on bail if he returns NT$700 million from
his family's Swiss bank accounts.</P>
      <P>As Chen's current detention period will expire on April 23, his family members
promised to do everything possible to return the money.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from local media coverage of the issue:</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>Teng Chen-chiu, the presiding judge at the Taiwan High Court collegial panel,
said that Chen's release depended heavily on whether the money is returned to a
bank account designated by the Supreme Prosecutors Office's Special
Investigation Division (SID).</P>
      <P>After the oral arguments were made, Chen spoke with his wife, son, daughter-in-
law and lawyers about how to repatriate the money soon.</P>
      <P>Teng told Chen's family that they should heed public opinion and repatriate the
money quickly, adding that it was crucial to secure the ex-president's release.</P>
      <P>Chen's lawyer, Cheng Wen-lung, pointed out that a slush fund from the Lafayette
frigate deal struck between Taiwan and France in the early 1990s is still frozen
in a Swiss bank account, adding that there are many reasons for the failure to
return overseas funds to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Cheng said the court shouldn't give a condition that a defendant could not
fulfill.</P>
      <P>The ex-president's wife, Wu Shu-jen, said that her husband's detention for over
500 days "set a record" in the history of the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>The problem of returning the money had to do with communication between the SID
and Swiss prosecution authorities, Wu said, adding that the former first family
had signed all the necessary documents. "It will be futile if you just keep
pushing us," she said. " We can't go rob the Swiss bank to get the money back."
United Daily News</P>
      <P>Teng told Chen Chih-chung, the ex-president's son, that the return of the money
was "crucial" to decisions on how to punish members of the former first family.</P>
      <P>The court is scheduled to hand down a ruling June 11 on Chen, his family members
and other defendants involved.</P>
      <P>Before that date, the court will convene a hearing on whether to extend the
detention of Chen, Teng said. If the money is not remitted, Chen will remain
behind bars, he added.</P>
      <P>Teng also said Chen will be given a "grace period, " adding that as long as
Chen's family repatriates the money back before the ruling, he will "take it
into consideration in weighing his release."</P>
      <P>Chen Chih-chung  said that the Swiss  Federal  Prosecution authorities, based on
the client's willingness, can agree to remit money back. He also said he will
continue to cooperate with the prosecutors, adding that as long as it helped the
case, he will not intentionally obstruct the transfer.</P>
      <P>Lawyers for Chen Shui-bian said that if SID prosecutors did not actively
communicate with the Swiss side, perhaps the responsibility should lie with
them.</P>
      <P>But public prosecutor Yueh Fang-ju stressed that she has been communicating with
the Swiss side since February and has not received sufficient responses from
Chen Chih-chung and his lawyers.</P>
      <P>Cheng Wen-lung, Chen's lawyer, said that the European Union might delay visa-
free privileges for Taiwan nationals due to Taiwan's recent moves toward
carrying out executions. He wondered if the move could also affect whether Swiss
judicial authorities remit the money back to Taiwan. (April 3, 2010)</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan will double the percentage of biodiesel in diesel for automobiles this
year, according to the Bureau of Energy under the Ministry of Economic Affairs.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that the consumption of biodiesel in Taiwan will increase to 100
million liters this year, decreasing carbon dioxide emissions, the bureau said
in a press release.</P>
      <P>Since July 2008, Taiwan has been mixing diesel for automobiles with 1 percent
biodiesel, making it the first country in Asia to use biodiesel on such a large
scale, the bureau said.</P>
      <P>In 2007, the country began several green projects, including a green public bus
program, a green township project and a plan aimed at supplying biodiesel
throughout the country.</P>
      <P>The projects have so far used 55 million liters of biodiesel.</P>
      <P>The decline in the use of traditional diesel amounted to 180,000 fewer tons of
CO2 emissions, the bureau said.</P>
      <P>There are currently 10 certified biodiesel producers in Taiwan, with a combined
total output of 105 million liters a year.</P>
      <P>The new biodiesel capacity has generated NT$1 billion (US$31.5 million) in
investment in peripheral industrial sectors. The figures show the biodiesel
sector has taken shape in Taiwan, the bureau said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>United Daily News: Concern over public land safety</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>04/03/10  16:50:13
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Three years after the high-speed railway system began operations, serious land
subsidence has been discovered along sections of the elevated line in Yunlin
County. The subsidence has already reached the upper limit of the system's
design tolerance, and if the problem is not resolved, the line's safety could be
compromised and service could even be suspended.</P>
      <P>Land subsidence has always been a factor in the high-speed rail system's safety,
and its Yunlin section has suffered the most from the sinking land because of
long-term extraction of groundwater. However, both the central and local
governments have failed to come up with approaches to counter the problem.</P>
      <P>The system is a major indicator of the safety of public infrastructure and
national lands. Continued land subsidence will also damage nearby ports,
expressways and cities.</P>
      <P>The earth's surface should have been able to support the weight produced by
human structures if large amounts of groundwater had not been extracted. Now
that science has proven wrong the claim by Yunlin County officials that land
subsidence was caused by the combined weight of high-speed railway system and
nearby freeways, their reluctance to seal off the many illegally dug wells in
the vicinity has exacerbated the problem.</P>
      <P>The Yunlin County authorities' refusal to seal the wells in the name of
protecting local farmers' interests is understandable, but the question is, what
is more important: the interests of local garlic farmers or the key north-south
high speed transportation line?</P>
      <P>If the subsidence was occurring at a uniform rate along the entire length of the
high speed rail, it would not be a major problem. But because the high speed
rail piers in Yunlin County are "settling" quickly at an uneven rate because of
the subsidence, a major safety risk could eventually develop.</P>
      <P>We must warn top officials in the central and local governments that land
subsidence is already occurring in many parts of Taiwan, and that they will be
held accountable if they fail to address the serious problem before it is too
late. (April 3, 2010)</P>

    <HEADLINE>President Ma brings ECFA campaign to Yunlin County</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou brought his campaign promoting a controversial framework
agreement on trade with China Saturday to a part of Taiwan that is a potential
hotbed of opposition to the pact.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a conference at National Yunlin University of Science and
Technology, Ma said the interests of Taiwan's people were the top priority in
his administration's effort to boost industrial and economic development through
a strategy of "strengthening Taiwan, linking the two sides of the Taiwan Strait,
and reaching out to the world."</P>
      <P>"The government will do its utmost to accomplish what is good for Taiwan and its
people, " he said.</P>
      <P>A key element of the government's strategy to tie Taiwan and China's markets
closer together is the proposed economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA).</P>
      <P>But critics contend it will force Taiwan to open its market to cheap Chinese
agricultural and light industrial goods that form the bedrock of local economies
in regions such as Yunlin County, where opposition to the pact is strong.</P>
      <P>Ma explained at the conference, however, that the trade pact would not require
Taiwan to allow in more agricultural items from China.</P>
      <P>The president later visited bedding and towel factories in the county to collect
local businesses' opinions on the ECFA and listen to their needs.</P>
      <P>The textile sector is one of the conventional industries seen as being
particularly vulnerable if cheap Chinese products are given access to Taiwan in
the ECFA with China.</P>
      <P>Ma made the tour accompanied by officials from the Ministry of Economic Affairs,
the Council of Agriculture, the Council of Labor Affairs and the Mainland
Affairs Council.</P>
      <P>The tour to Yunlin is part of Ma's efforts to personally promote the trade pact,
an initiative the administration hopes will prevent Taiwan's marginalization
from key regional trade blocs, such as the free trade zone consisting of China
and the Association of Southeast Nations.</P>
      <P>The pact,  however,  has been harshly  criticized  by the pro-independence "pan-
green camp, " which argues that Taiwan will become too economically dependent on
China and lose its sovereignty.</P>
      <P>The latest ECFA talks wrapped up April 1 in Taoyuan County, with the two parties
agreeing that no agricultural items which Taiwan does not import from China at
present would be included in the pact's "early harvest" program.</P>
      <P>The two sides have also reached a consensus that China will not ask Taiwan to
open its doors to Chinese workers.</P>
      <P>According to Ma's close aides, President Ma will travel to Kaohsiung on April 10
to continue his ECFA promotional campaign.</P>
      <P>In addition, issues related to the trade pact are expected to be the topic of a
planned video conference between Ma and Harvard University teachers and students
on April 6.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of Bunun tribal youngsters from Taitung County, southeastern Taiwan,
shouted "ancestral spirits, we're back" Saturday on the banks of a mountain lake
located at the crossroads of the migration route of their ancestors.</P>
      <P>They also sang a magnificent eight-part harmony to express their joy and
excitement at seeing Jiaming Lake, so clear and beautiful that it is called
"angel's tears, " about 200 meters below the peak of Sanchashan ("three-fork
mountain") in the Central Mountain Range.</P>
      <P>The eight youngsters from Wulu Elementary School -- three girls and five boys --
started their "Jiaming Lake root-finding journey" with school and Forestry
Bureau staff Thursday morning.</P>
      <P>Bunun elders saw them off and wished them a smooth trip as the students began
their ascent of Siangyang Mountain, which is about 2,300 meters high.</P>
      <P>Chiu Jung-yi, director of the school's Lidao branch, said that "the students
have good physical strength."</P>
      <P>They would need it, because the trail that stretches from Siangyangshan to
Jiaming Lake on Sanchashan requires hikers to climb two separate slopes of over
70 degrees on the first day of the two-day climb.</P>
      <P>At night, they stayed at a lodge where they spotted several water deer.</P>
      <P>Chiu Chiang-yung, a teacher who accompanied his three children on the journey,
said that Jiaming Lake has been closed to outsiders since Typhoon Morakot last
August.</P>
      <P>"The water deer have not seen so many people for some time, and they might try
to approach the lodge to look for food," he said.</P>
      <P>On Friday morning, the group departed for the 3,490-meter Sanchashan.</P>
      <P>Later eight-year-old Chiu Chun, believed to be the youngest person ever to scale
the mountain, said he was elated to complete the journey, noting that his father
has said to him that the mountain used to be a hunting ground for the Bunun
tribe.</P>
      <P>The Bunun are one of the three "high-mountain" tribes, along with the Atayal and
the Taroko, who are among Taiwan's 14 recognized indigenous tribes. They once
lived in the Central Mountain Ridge before migrating to lower ground. From
Jiaming Lake, many of them moved to Hualien, Taitung and Nantou.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou will focus on Taiwan's economic isolation in arguing for
a trade pact with China during an upcoming debate with the chairwoman of the
opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) on the issue, Ma's spokesman Lo
Chih-chiang said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Ma will focus on the argument  that a proposed  economic cooperation framework
agreement (ECFA) between the two sides across Taiwan Strait "is an important
step in breaking through the country's isolation created when the DPP was in
power," Lo said.</P>
      <P>He stressed that the planned debate has nothing to do with Ma's attempt to raise
his low public popularity rating.</P>
      <P>Ma will tell the public in his much-anticipated debate with Tsai Ing-wen that
his government has tried hard since taking office in 2008 to free the country
from its international isolation, Lo said.</P>
      <P>He contended that the DPP's "closed-door" policy not only marginalized Taiwan in
the international economic community but also marginalized its diplomacy.</P>
      <P>Lo said, however, that promoting the signing of the ECFA with China is only part
of Ma's strategy to break out from under the shadow of Taiwan's isolation.</P>
      <P>In response to some pundits who said the debate is an attempt by the president
to increase his popularity and public support, Lo said Ma was delighted to
debate with the DPP leader on the cross-strait trade pact in a rational manner.</P>
      <P>The president hopes the public will obtain more information on the controversial
agreement through the debate, he said, adding that Ma has not thought about his
re-election bid in 2012.</P>

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Formosa  Plastics  Group was recently  ordered by the Environmental
Protection Administration to clean up its seriously polluted 35.4-hectare Jenwu
plant. The facility's pollution problems were first discovered four years ago,
but it continued operating until recently and has caused even more serious
pollution.</P>
      <P>This latest environmental incident shed light on a serious lack of morality on
the part of the company and on the government's dereliction of duty. After so
many similar cases and a huge price paid, it is apparent that Taiwan has not
learned lessons from these tragedies and has failed to make itself into a
textbook model for other Asian countries.</P>
      <P>The government promised 19 years ago that the Kaohsiung City refinery of state-
oil giant CPC Corporation would be relocated in 25 years, but the issue and the
facility's pollution still remain nearly 20 years later. The government and the
company must deal with the issue in the near future.</P>
      <P>If the government simply issues fines and forces companies to relocate in
dealing with polluters, such an experience is not worth being transferred to
other countries. (April 3, 2010)</P>

      <P>A 68-year-old female Taipei County citizen became the millionth passenger on the
Sun Moon Lake Cable Car Saturday, earning her a "golden passport" that entitles
her to ride the system free of charge for the rest of her life.</P>
      <P>Kuo A-hsia said that she was surprised when a cable system worker presented her
a wreath, as she had no knowledge of the "millionth rider celebration event"

      <P>Between the system's opening on Dec. 28, 2009 and Friday's closing time, 998,311
people had taken the cable car between two of central Taiwan's most popular
tourist destinations -- Sun Moon Lake and the Formosan Aboriginal Culture
Village amusement park, park official said. The system handles around 6,000 to
8,000 passengers per day.</P>
      <P>In addition to free lifetime admission to the park and the cable car service,
Kuo received a NT$14,300 gift certificate for a lakeside hotel. The 999,999th
passenger, Lin Ching-tong, a male resident of Jhongli Township in Central

    <TEXT>
      <P>The water supply in the greater Kaohsiung area is expected to be adequate until
May, when it is hoped seasonal rains will bring further relief to drought-
stricken southern Taiwan, local river management sources said Saturday.</P>
      <P>According to the Kao-ping Diversion Weir Operation Center, more than 30
millimeters of rain fell in both February and March in the upper reaches of the
Kaoping River, helping it accumulate water that will supply the Kaohsiung area.</P>
      <P>The center currently provides around 105 tons of water per day to local
residents. If more rain falls in April and May, water can continue to be
supplied normally into June, center officials said.</P>
      <P>To promote greater rainfall in the south, the Air Force, the Water Resoruces
Agency (WRA) and an atmospheric sciences team from National Taiwan University
attempted on Friday to generate rain artificially  over the water catchment
areas of the Tsengwen, Wushantou and Nanhua reservoirs in Tainan and Chiayi
counties.</P>
      <P>The artificial rain offensive, the biggest in Taiwan in years, produced a slight
drizzle in Kaohsiung on Saturday.</P>
      <P>WRA Deputy Director-General Wu Yueh-si admitted, however, that it would be
difficult to produce heavy rainfall artificially during the November-to-April
dry season, when the area receives only 10 percent of its annual rainfall.</P>
      <P>But with weather fronts expected to pass over central Taiwan in the coming days,
the authorities will soon renew their efforts to create rain, he added.</P>
      <P>Wu said a day earlier that the water supply across Taiwan should be secure
through the end of July, with the greater Kaohsiung area the exception.</P>
      <P>No rain has fallen in parts of southern Taiwan since Typhoon Morakot devastated
that part of the country last August. Spring rice planting in some areas of

      <P>An official of the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) said Saturday that Taiwanese-
invested businesses in China will be required to label their products as "Made
in China, " ahead of discussions on the issue between the two countries that are
expected to begin soon.</P>
      <P>Defining the country of origin is an issue that nations often face after signing
free trade agreements, said MAC Vice Chairman Liu Teh-shun, because of the
complexity of supply chains and production processes.</P>
      <P>If Taiwanese businessmen make their products in China, they will have to list
China as the country of origin, Liu said, although the origin of their materials
and the nationality of the owners of the business will also be taken into
consideration.</P>
      <P>Some Taiwanese businesses in China have hoped under certain conditions to list
their products as "Made in Taiwan" for various reasons.</P>
      <P>The issue is pressing because Taiwan and China could soon sign a framework
agreement on trade in which products covered under the deal's "early harvest"
list would be given tariff reductions or exemptions -- as long as they are made
in the two countries.</P>
      <P>At the recently concluded second round of negotiations on the economic framework

      <P>An official of the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) said Saturday that Taiwanese-
invested businesses in China will be required to label their products as "Made
in China, " ahead of discussions on the issue between the two countries that are
expected to begin soon.</P>
      <P>Defining the country of origin is an issue that nations often face after signing
free trade agreements, said MAC Vice Chairman Liu Teh-shun, because of the
complexity of supply chains and production processes.</P>
      <P>If Taiwanese businessmen make their products in China, they will have to list
China as the country of origin, Liu said, although the origin of their materials
and the nationality of the owners of the business will also be taken into
consideration.</P>
      <P>Some Taiwanese businesses in China have hoped under certain conditions to list
their products as "Made in Taiwan" for various reasons.</P>
      <P>The issue is pressing because Taiwan and China could soon sign a framework
agreement on trade in which products covered under the deal's "early harvest"
list would be given tariff reductions or exemptions -- as long as they are made
in the two countries.</P>
      <P>At the recently concluded second round of negotiations on the economic framework
cooperation agreement (ECFA), the two sides agreed to start talks on setting
guidelines to establish a product's origin.</P>
      <P>At present, Taiwan law defines a product's origin as final country in which a

    <HEADLINE>Former U.S. President George W. Bush will not visit in April: MOFA</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Former U.S. President George W. Bush will not visit Taiwan in April because of
his tight schedule during his tour of Asia, an official of the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs (MOFA) confirmed Sunday.</P>
      <P>Despite the setback, the official said the ministry will continue its efforts to
invite the former U.S. president, who left office in 2009, for a visit in the
future.</P>
      <P>The official denied that a media report publicizing Bush's visit was the main
reason Bush will not come to Taiwan this month. Instead, the issue was the tight
itinerary of the former president, who might have to rush back to the U.S. after
his trip to Asia.</P>
      <P>The official said that inviting prominent U.S. politicians to visit Taiwan is
one of the MOFA's responsibilities but that getting them to come is difficult
because their schedules are often set well in advance.</P>
      <P>Foreign Minister Timothy C.T. Yang said earlier this week that he could not
confirm a reported visit by Bush and that the idea was only in the initial
stages of consideration.</P>
      <P>Next Magazine reported recently that Bush had accepted an invitation from Jason
Yuan, Taiwan's representative in the United States, to visit Taiwan in late
April.</P>

    <HEADLINE>'Flexible diplomacy' helps improve Taiwan's image in Pacific</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 3 (CNA)
04/04/10  16:22:10
(By Garfie Li and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou has insisted in his two years in office that a flexible
diplomatic strategy could help Taiwan break free from the stigma of checkbook
diplomacy and project a new image and status in the international community.</P>
      <P>If he needed validation of the strategy, he may have found it during a recent
visit to Taiwan's six allies in the South Pacific, where Taiwan and China have
long engaged in a diplomatic tug-of-war for the loyalty of allies.</P>
      <P>The shift in Australia's attitude toward Taiwan seen prior to and during the
trip provides a telling example of how Taiwan's new diplomatic strategy has
earned it positive international recognition.</P>
      <P>Canberra has abhorred the corrupt practices engendered by the fight for allies
between Taiwan and China, and it was on edge whenever the Solomon Islands, one
of the main battlegrounds of the two diplomatic combatants, held parliamentary
elections.</P>
      <P>Feeling obliged to prevent Taiwan and China from interfering in the elections
through unethical means, Canberra would even send senior officials to the
Solomon Islands to monitor the situation closely.</P>
      <P>When Ma visited Australia four years ago in his capacity as chairman of the
then-opposition Kuomintang, he felt humiliated, as Australian officials tended
to show contempt whenever they mentioned Taiwan.</P>
      <P>That experience helped spawn the concept of flexible diplomacy -- which the
administration describes as a "modus vivendi" approach -- and Ma vowed to change
Australia's views on Taiwan should he win the presidency.</P>
      <P>"One should not do anything illegitimate or improper if one wants to win others'
respect," Ma believed.</P>
      <P>Australia's new attitude was on display during Ma's trip to the Solomon Islands,
where he was able to freely enter the headquarters of the Regional Assistance
Mission to the Solomon Islands (RAMSI) to listen to briefings on the key
functions of the organization, which is led by Australia and New Zealand.</P>
      <P>Ma also won the praise of Australian media, including in an article by the
Australian headlined, "Taiwan purges Pacific island graft."</P>
      <P>So it was hard for others to imagine the ridicule Ma has endured in promoting
his "flexible diplomacy" and the idea of a "diplomatic truce" with China.</P>
      <P>Critics mocked the strategy as a "diplomatic shock" and a "diplomatic holiday"
and argued that it left the country's relations with its 23 diplomatic allies
dependent on charity from China.</P>
      <P>Ma was determined to refute the criticism with concrete action during his recent
South Pacific diplomatic tour that featured visits to each of Taiwan's six
allies in the region -- the Marshall Islands, Kiribati, Tuvalu, Nauru, the
Solomon Islands and Palau.</P>
      <P>At the stop in Nauru, Ma denied that the diplomatic truce was a diplomatic
holiday and said Taiwan was actively strengthening economic and cultural ties
with its allies, citing aid programs devised for each of its six Pacific allies
that were tailored to their needs.</P>
      <P>Those aid programs are required to follow the principles of having a legitimate
purpose, following legal procedures and being implemented effectively, a
departure from the past welcomed on Ma's trip.</P>
      <P>"We want to stamp out corruption. Enough is enough, " Solomon Islands Prime
Minister Derek Sikua was quoted as saying by the Australian.</P>
      <P>Ma was also greeted in the Solomon Islands by an editorial in the Solomon Star
describing "the abuse of your taxpayers' money by MPs using Taiwanese aid money
as a slush fund. We are begging you to put a stop to this."</P>
      <P>Ma responded that he was not afraid to offend diplomatic friends by preventing
aid from being used illegitimately or unscrupulously.</P>
      <P>The president's words did not fall on deaf ears. A senior Solomon Islands
official responsible for a rural development program promised Ma that his agency
will keep close tabs on the use of Taiwan-donated funding.</P>
      <P>The various assistance programs offered by the president during his visits, such
as food aid, garbage treatment, solar energy development,  aquaculture
assistance,  free school lunches and vocational training, coupled with the
concern he showed over the potential threat of climate change to the allies,
enabled Taiwan to be depicted with a positive, active image in international
news coverage.</P>
      <P>Such reports are also expected to help make the world community face up to the
unreasonable exclusion of Taiwan from the United Nations Framework Convention on
Climate Change.</P>
      <P>Under the policy of flexible diplomacy, Taiwan has discontinued its
confrontational engagement with China in the international arena and has instead
practiced diplomacy in a dignified, responsible and cooperative manner, the
president said.</P>
      <P>The result, Ma argued, is that the international community will no longer be
troubled by the negative consequences of cross-strait diplomatic competition and
will instead benefit from changes in the cross-strait situation.</P>
      <P>He also expects Taiwan's people to benefit as well.</P>
      <P>At the conclusion of his South Pacific tour, Ma stressed that he was committed
to making his "flexible diplomacy" strategy a success, pledging to lead Taiwan
out of its diplomatic isolation and to find an opening that will allow Taiwan's
people to receive respect when traveling abroad.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A rendition of Puccini's opera "Turandot" presented by renowned Chinese director
Zhang Yimou and staged in Taichung City in late March left an audience of 40,000
deeply moved, but it also invited criticism from some in Taiwan driven by a
political mentality.</P>
      <P>Members of the audience were captivated by Zhang's extravagant production,  but
the critics  from  the opposition  Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) gave a
thumbs-down to the organization of the staging of the opera.</P>
      <P>They used Turandot's final act, Nessun dorma (None shall sleep), to deride
Taichung Mayor Jason Hu -- who was instrumental in bringing the show to Taichung
-- as having "slept for eight years during his stint as mayor."</P>
      <P>We think the performance was not only a musical and visual feast for the
audience, it was also a rare and invaluable opportunity for local performers who
took part in the show to sharpen their skills.</P>
      <P>The Taichung City government  had previously  invited many world-renowned
artists to perform in Taichung, including Luciano Pavarotti in 2005 and Andrea
Bocelli in 2008, but none of the shows had been condemned by DPP critics.</P>
      <P>We wonder if the critics were unhappy with Zhang Yimou's presentation because
Zhang is a movie director from China and because the show was a copy of the
performance put on by Zhang at Beijing's Olympic Stadium, popularly known as the
Bird's Nest.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is a mature society, and its people should have the same opportunity as
others around the world to appreciate artistic masterpieces, which are common
assets of humankind. How wonderful it is for peoples to communicate and
understand each other through the beauty of the performing arts.</P>
      <P>It is not desirable for people to limit Taiwan's participation in the world's
artistic or cultural activities, and it is not necessary to view talent from
China cynically.</P>
      <P>Exchanges through cultural activities is one of the most peaceful and
constructive ways to cement cross-strait ties. If Chinese tourists could be
moved by watching "The Village," a play produced by theater director Stan Lai on
the lives of Nationalist military troops who moved to Taiwan after 1949 and
their children, why can't the Taiwanese appreciate an opera produced and
directed by a Chinese director with some magnanimity? (April 4, 2010)</P>

      <P>Tsao Tien-lun, vice president of Taiwan International Investment Management,
suggested that investors hold China-themed shares, because they are likely to
remain strong for the whole year.</P>
      <P>Stocks related to Apple's iPad, cloud computing and smart grid products are also
expected to have strong showings, Tsao added.</P>
      <P>He predicted that the local bourse's recent rally will continue, with the
benchmark Taiex soon breaking the previous year's high of 8,395.</P>
      <P>He was optimistic in part because foreign investors were net buyers of NT$113.1
billion in shares in March. Based on historical data, whenever foreign investors
buy a net NT$100 billion or more in shares in a month, share prices the
following month rise between 1-3 percent, Tsao said.</P>
      <P>But he also expressed concerns that the government's National Stabilization Fund
will withdraw from the stock market.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, some analysts attributed the recent rebound in the market to strong
corporate earnings in the technology sector.</P>
      <P>The first quarter is normally the industry's low season, but many companies
posted better-than-expected sales during the period, with the revenues of seven
LED manufacturers setting single-month highs in March.</P>
      <P>LED-backlit TV shipments are expected to exceed 30 million units this year, more
than 10 times the number shipped last year.</P>
      <P>Semiconductor and LED companies are also expected to see a significant boom in
their businesses due to high demand in China.</P>
      <P>LED manufacturer Elite Advance Laser Corporation (eLaser) is expected to post
March sales of more than NT$160 million, 200 percent higher than in the same
period last year. (April 4, 2010).</P>
      <P>Commercial Times:</P>
      <P>As there has been an increasing demand for LED, solar energy, aviation products,
electric vehicles and foodstuffs ahead of the Shanghai Expo slated to open May
1, shares related to these sectors have become popular recently and are set to
surge in the coming month, analysts said.</P>
      <P>For example, the share prices of Formosa Epitaxy Inc., a major indium gallium
nitride (InGaN) manufacturer, leading retailer Ruentex Industries, and
electronics distributors Synnex Technology and Tsann Kuen have risen
significantly because of strong sales related to the Shanghai Expo.</P>
      <P>The event, with will open in May, is expected to attract 70 million visitors, 10
times the number that visited Beijing for the Summer Olympics in 2008.</P>
      <P>Although the outlook for the local stock market this year is bright, the Taiex
will likely move in starts and stops in the short term before rebounding to
challenge the 10,000-point mark in the second half of this year, said Charles
Hsiao, president of Fubon Securities Investment Services Co.</P>
      <P>Hsiao said Q2 would be a good time for investors to jump into the market,  and
he suggested they focus their attention  on the performance of stock markets in
other countries, the signing of a proposed economic cooperation framework
agreement (ECFA) with China, the year-end five special municipality elections,
and domestic demand in China.</P>
      <P>He said the Taiex would likely hover between 8,107 and 8,395 in the near future.</P>
      <P>ECFA-themed stocks and shares in companies that produce iPad and upstream PC
components would outperform the overall market, Hsiao predicted.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Liu Kuan-hsi, general manager of Masterlink Securities Investment
Advisory Corp., predicted that the Taiex would hover between 7,500 and 8,000 in
the second quarter and would challenge the previous 2010 high of 8,395 later
this year.</P>
      <P>Liu said whether the Taiex could surpass the 9,000-point mark and test the
10,000-point threshold will depend on the government's policies and issues
related to the cross-Taiwan Strait ECFA and special municipality elections.</P>
      <P>Mobile phone, Internet, iPad, banking and financial issues as well as China-
themed stocks will have strong showings, he said. (April 4, 2010).</P>

    <HEADLINE>United Daily News: Prevailing corruption among professors</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>04/04/10  18:23:23
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A professor from National Cheng Kung University in Tainan was indicted recently
for inflating research expenses in her claim for reimbursement under a project
financed by the National Science Council.</P>
      <P>The defendant complained during the prosecutors' investigation that "a lot of
people do the same thing."</P>
      <P>Investigators should look into the indicted professor's claim that she was just
following a practice prevalent among professors, because her actions may only by
the tip of an iceberg.</P>
      <P>Local news reports cited a National Science Council official as saying that an
unnamed male professor even claimed reimbursement for expenses for sanitary
napkins. But this report was never verified.</P>
      <P>Professors may claim compensation for research expenses without limit but the
expenses should be somehow related to their studies, at least on the surface.
From what we know, there are loopholes in the current system that offer
professors chances to grease their palms.</P>
      <P>For example, in terms of consumables and miscellaneous expenses, the leader of a
research project may well collude with suppliers to claim reimbursement with
false invoices.</P>
      <P>Listing family members as research assistants to claim wages as part of the
project is another way to line one's pockets, but it's not the most ridiculous
claim, because it is not explicitly forbidden in existing regulations. The worst
is when professors claim wages for assistants who simply don't exist.</P>
      <P>We are not saying that these are practices followed by most professors or that
they highlight the low morale of scholars. We are simply pointing out that the
flawed mechanism used to finance research budgets has paved the way for the
waste of resources.</P>
      <P>Scholars who debase themselves by siphoning off research funds should not be
forgiven. But the money they have taken pales in comparison to the funds wasted
because of the program's poor design and lack of efficiency.</P>
      <P>Scholars used to be the most outspoken critics of corruption in the government.
They should now live up to the standards they once required of officials. (April

    <HEADLINE>Presidential Office keeps heat on DPP over DPP-era foreign policy</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  4 (CNA)
04/04/10  19:27:08
(By Lee Shu-hua and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Presidential Office continued to challenge the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) Sunday over its foreign policy approach while it was in
power from 2000-2008, in what may be a prelude to an upcoming debate over a
proposed trade pact with China.</P>
      <P>The offensive began Saturday when President Ma Ying-jeou's spokesman Lo Chih-
chiang said Ma will focus on the economic isolation caused by the DPP's policies
to buttress his support for a framework agreement on trade with China when he
debates the issue later this month.</P>
      <P>According to the Liberty Times, DPP Legislator Tsai Huang-liang later denied the
accusations that the DPP had adopted a "closed-door policy" that led to Taiwan's
isolation, citing the party's effort to push for Taiwan's WTO accession.</P>
      <P>Lo responded Sunday, however, that Taiwan actually began the push to join the
World Trade Organization (WTO) while the Kuomintang (KMT) was in power in the
late 1980s and that the DPP simply harvested the results of the KMT's efforts
when Taiwan gained admission to the world trade body in November 2001.</P>
      <P>The exchange reflects one of the fault lines likely to color the upcoming debate
between President Ma and DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen on the controversial
economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) with China.</P>
      <P>The president believes it is an essential first step in combating Taiwan's
economic marginalization while the DPP sees it as a trap that will leave the
country at China's mercy.</P>
      <P>Lo said Saturday the president will make the argument that an ECFA "is an
important step in breaking through the country's isolation created when the DPP
was in power."</P>
      <P>He added Sunday that the historical record will prove that Taiwan began efforts
to join the WTO's predecessor, the GATT, in 1987 when Vice President Vincent
Siew was serving as the director of the Bureau of Foreign Trade.</P>
      <P>Taiwan submitted an application for membership with the GATT's Secretariat in
1990, launching a 10-year process of bilateral and multilateral trade
negotiations with many countries around the world, Lo said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan was granted observer status by the GATT in 1992 and formally acceded to
the world trade body on January 1, 2002, Lo said.</P>
      <P>The spokesman added that Taiwan was the world's 14th leading exporter in the
world in 2002, but that the ranking continued to slide, to 17th in early 2009.</P>
      <P>"An assessment made by the Bureau of Foreign Trade concluded that Taiwan's
ranking could rebound back to at least 15th if the ECFA is signed and
implemented in the next year or two," Lo said.</P>
      <P>"Amid the rising global trend of regional integration  to facilitate trade and
economic development, how can Taiwan maintain its economic lifeline if it fails
to sign the trade pact with China?" he asked.</P>
      <P>The Ma administration has been pushing hard for the conclusion of the pact with
China out of concern that the country will be marginalized by being left out of
regional trade blocks.</P>
      <P>The DPP strongly opposes the pact, however, arguing that it will actually lead
to heavy job losses domestically and will undermine Taiwan's sovereignty.</P>

      <P>Merger and acquisition activity remained robust in Taiwan last year despite the
global financial crisis, an economics official said Sunday.</P>
      <P>According to the official, 185 mergers and acquisitions worth NT$34.42 billion
(US$1.08 billion) were made last year, of which 84.3 percent were mergers. Most
of the deals came in the electronics sector.</P>
      <P>The high rate of mergers reflected the ambition of domestic enterprises to boost
their international competitiveness during the economic downturn by expanding
the sizes of their companies, the official said.</P>
      <P>Since the Business Mergers And Acquisitions Act was promulgated Feb. 6,  2002,
there have been more than 1,300 mergers and acquisitions worth a total of NT$620
billion in Taiwan, according to Ministry of Economic Affairs statistics.</P>
      <P>Such deals are considered favorable to corporate restructuring and to help
companies increase their economies of scale, cut costs, enhance  production
efficiency   and  boost  international competitiveness.</P>
      <P>Last year,  the highest number of deals was seen in the electronics sector, with
40, or 21.6 percent of the total, followed by 24 deals made in the construction

      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih again pushed Sunday for speedy construction of permanent
housing for people displaced by Typhoon Morakot last August.</P>
      <P>"We hope all the permanent houses now under construction can be completed before
the end of July so that Morakot victims will be resettled in those houses by the
storm's first anniversary, " Wu said while inspecting a housing construction
project on Majia Farm in southern Taiwan's Pingtung County.</P>
      <P>The Majia housing project will accommodate aboriginal households from the
county's Haocha and Dashe villages, both of which were destroyed by Morakot-
triggered floodwaters and mudslides.</P>
      <P>The premier expressed his gratitude for the cooperation of Majia residents in
providing their land for the housing project and for the sponsorship of
Christian charity World Vision Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The charity's executive director, Hank Du,  said that 319 households have been
approved for settlement in the Majia Farm housing project to date.</P>
      <P>According to the premier, only those who filed applications before March 15 were
eligible to be resettled in the permanent houses to be built there.</P>
      <P>A model house has been completed, while other parts of the 30-hectare land are
being prepared for construction, Du said.</P>
      <P>Though completing construction of more than 300 houses at a high quality level
in four months is a big challenge for his organization, Du said his organization
will do its utmost to live up to the premier's expectations.</P>
      <P>Typhoon survivors from Haucha and Dashe villages will be hired to build their
new homes under an "employment substitution relief" program, Du said, and the
new houses will be environmentally friendly buildings, with each unit expected
to help reduce carbon emissions by 40 tons per year.</P>
      <P>In addition to residential houses,  nine churches and one elementary school will
be built on Majia Farm. A center dedicated to developing local agricultural
specialties will also be established to help residents start up new businesses
and earn a living on their own in the future.</P>

      <P>A stone stele that is inscribed with the Chinese characters "Sun Moon Lake" and
stands in front of a temple in the scenic area remains the most popular spot for
taking pictures among Chinese visitors to Taiwan, a local volunteer tour guide
said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The iconic monument has become a landmark in the Sun Moon Lake National Scenic
Area in Nantou County and always draws crowds of Chinese tourists, who treasure
pictures taken there as a special keepsake of their trip to the lake, according
to the tour guide.</P>
      <P>Although there are another four or five steles with the words "Sun Moon Lake" in
the area, the stone erected in front of Syuanguang Temple has attracted the
greatest interest of Chinese travelers, in part because the back of the stone
bears a sculpture depicting Tang Dynasty Dharma Xuan Zang's trip to fetch sutras
in the Western Heaven, the tour guide noted.</P>
      <P>It also provides a panoramic view of the lake.</P>
      <P>The scenic area is one of the must-see destinations for Chinese tourists
visiting Taiwan, and travel agencies will usually arrange for them a boat tour
of three major spots that of course includes Syuanguang Temple, along with Lalu
Island and Ita Thao, the village of the area's Thao Aborigines.</P>

      <P>Mainland Affairs Council Minister Lai Shin-yuan defended a proposed economic
cooperaton framework agreement (ECFA) with China Sunday in an interview with
cable station Sanlih E-Television (SETTV).</P>
      <P>The minister rebutted opposition Democratic Progressive Party claims that
Chinese agriculture products and workers will eventually be brought into Taiwan
according to rules of the World Trade Organization (WTO), despite the
government's promise to the contrary.</P>
      <P>The opposition party has argued that under WTO rules, ECFA is only a
transitional step toward a free trade agreement,  and signatories are obliged to
open their market to 95 percent of each other's commercial products and services
within 10 years.</P>
      <P>"There are no such rules under the World Trade Organization, and the DPP is well
aware of that," Lai said to SETTV, which tends to be critical of the government
and ruling Kuomintang.</P>
      <P>"No country in the world has opened its market completely to another state's
goods, and that's especially true for agricultural products. The United States
hasn't and neither has the European Union," Lai said.</P>
      <P>She also dismissed opponents' concerns that what Taiwan gains in the initial
rounds of negotiations -- thanks to China's promise to offer Taiwan concessions
-- will be lost later as it will be forced to compensate Beijing for the
concessions that were made.</P>
      <P>Lai said both Beijing and Taipei have realized the sharp difference in the size
of their economies and contended that China will not have more items than Taiwan
on a list of goods and services that will enjoy greater market access or
immediate tariff reductions or exemptions.</P>
      <P>Each side will seek their own maximum benefit when drawing up their lists of
products designated for preferential treatment, called the early harvest  list,
but the final list will depend on negotiations, the minister said.</P>
      <P>Lai said the proposed pact enjoys the support of about 50 percent of the people
according to various opinion polls, but the government, which is hoping for a
higher support rating, is still not satisfied.</P>
      <P>Noting that the complexity of such a pact is difficult for ordinary people to
understand, Lai said Japan has inked free trade pacts with other states when
polls showed only 10 percent of the people supported them.</P>
      <P>She also dismissed the idea of having an ad hoc team of lawmakers supervise the
government's engagement with China, saying existing mechanisms have provided
lawmakers with sufficient opportunity to discuss and supervise the executive
branch's work related to mainland China affairs.</P>
      <P>When asked why Chinese top negotiator Chen Yunlin referred her by her name
rather than her official title in their two public meetings, the minister said
she understood Chen's concerns as Taipei and Beijing have yet to acknowledge
each other officially, and the problem is not expected to be solved in the near
future.</P>
      <P>"He paid a visit on me because I am the head of the Mainland Affairs Council,
and the country's sovereignty is none the worse because of Chen's omission of my
title," Lai said.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou's administration has gone all out to push for the pact
with China -- and hopes to sign it in June -- to prevent Taiwan from being
economically marginalized as other states in the region form trade blocs.</P>
      <P>The initiative has drawn fire from the DPP, which believes the pact undermine
the country's sovereignty and provide Beijing with leverage in trying to annex
Taiwan, which it considers part of its territory.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's top watchdog body, the Control Yuan, may censure supervisory agencies
for turning a blind eye to the irregular use of funds in the implementation of a
five-year NT$50 billion to upgrade the country's universities.</P>
      <P>Control Yuan member Ger Yeong-kuang said his office has asked the Ministry of
Audit to investigate a media report alleging that five elite universities,
including National Taiwan University (NTU), spent NT$117 million (US$3.68
million) in three and a half years on carbon cartridges for printers and ink
cartridges for printers, copiers and fax machines.</P>
      <P>The five-year NT$50 billion plan was launched in 2005 by the former Democratic
Progressive Party administration to help NTU and National Cheng Kung University
join the ranks of the world's first-class universities.</P>
      <P>Ten other universities, including National Tsing Hua University, were supported

      <P>According to Ger,  a preliminary  investigation  has found irregularities in the

the lead after the third round of the US$2 million LPGA Kraft Nabisco
Championship, the LPGA Tour's first major of the year.</P>
      <P>Tseng's three-day score of 207 left her tied for second with Suzann Pettersen,

    <HEADLINE>'Flexible diplomacy' helps improve Taiwan's image in Pacific</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 3 (CNA)
04/04/10  16:22:10
(By Garfie Li and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou has insisted in his two years in office that a flexible
diplomatic strategy could help Taiwan break free from the stigma of checkbook
diplomacy and project a new image and status in the international community.</P>
      <P>If he needed validation of the strategy, he may have found it during a recent
visit to Taiwan's six allies in the South Pacific, where Taiwan and China have
long engaged in a diplomatic tug-of-war for the loyalty of allies.</P>
      <P>The shift in Australia's attitude toward Taiwan seen prior to and during the
trip provides a telling example of how Taiwan's new diplomatic strategy has
earned it positive international recognition.</P>
      <P>Canberra has abhorred the corrupt practices engendered by the fight for allies
between Taiwan and China, and it was on edge whenever the Solomon Islands, one
of the main battlegrounds of the two diplomatic combatants, held parliamentary
elections.</P>
      <P>Feeling obliged to prevent Taiwan and China from interfering in the elections
through unethical means, Canberra would even send senior officials to the
Solomon Islands to monitor the situation closely.</P>
      <P>When Ma visited Australia four years ago in his capacity as chairman of the
then-opposition Kuomintang, he felt humiliated, as Australian officials tended
to show contempt whenever they mentioned Taiwan.</P>
      <P>That experience helped spawn the concept of flexible diplomacy -- which the
administration describes as a "modus vivendi" approach -- and Ma vowed to change
Australia's views on Taiwan should he win the presidency.</P>
      <P>"One should not do anything illegitimate or improper if one wants to win others'
respect," Ma believed.</P>
      <P>Australia's new attitude was on display during Ma's trip to the Solomon Islands,
where he was able to freely enter the headquarters of the Regional Assistance
Mission to the Solomon Islands (RAMSI) to listen to briefings on the key
functions of the organization, which is led by Australia and New Zealand.</P>
      <P>Ma also won the praise of Australian media, including in an article by the
Australian headlined, "Taiwan purges Pacific island graft."</P>
      <P>So it was hard for others to imagine the ridicule Ma has endured in promoting
his "flexible diplomacy" and the idea of a "diplomatic truce" with China.</P>
      <P>Critics mocked the strategy as a "diplomatic shock" and a "diplomatic holiday"
and argued that it left the country's relations with its 23 diplomatic allies
dependent on charity from China.</P>
      <P>Ma was determined to refute the criticism with concrete action during his recent
South Pacific diplomatic tour that featured visits to each of Taiwan's six
allies in the region -- the Marshall Islands, Kiribati, Tuvalu, Nauru, the
Solomon Islands and Palau.</P>
      <P>At the stop in Nauru, Ma denied that the diplomatic truce was a diplomatic
holiday and said Taiwan was actively strengthening economic and cultural ties
with its allies, citing aid programs devised for each of its six Pacific allies
that were tailored to their needs.</P>
      <P>Those aid programs are required to follow the principles of having a legitimate
purpose, following legal procedures and being implemented effectively, a
departure from the past welcomed on Ma's trip.</P>
      <P>"We want to stamp out corruption. Enough is enough, " Solomon Islands Prime
Minister Derek Sikua was quoted as saying by the Australian.</P>
      <P>Ma was also greeted in the Solomon Islands by an editorial in the Solomon Star
describing "the abuse of your taxpayers' money by MPs using Taiwanese aid money
as a slush fund. We are begging you to put a stop to this."</P>
      <P>Ma responded that he was not afraid to offend diplomatic friends by preventing
aid from being used illegitimately or unscrupulously.</P>
      <P>The president's words did not fall on deaf ears. A senior Solomon Islands
official responsible for a rural development program promised Ma that his agency
will keep close tabs on the use of Taiwan-donated funding.</P>
      <P>The various assistance programs offered by the president during his visits, such
as food aid, garbage treatment, solar energy development,  aquaculture
assistance,  free school lunches and vocational training, coupled with the
concern he showed over the potential threat of climate change to the allies,
enabled Taiwan to be depicted with a positive, active image in international
news coverage.</P>
      <P>Such reports are also expected to help make the world community face up to the
unreasonable exclusion of Taiwan from the United Nations Framework Convention on
Climate Change.</P>
      <P>Under the policy of flexible diplomacy, Taiwan has discontinued its
confrontational engagement with China in the international arena and has instead
practiced diplomacy in a dignified, responsible and cooperative manner, the
president said.</P>
      <P>The result, Ma argued, is that the international community will no longer be
troubled by the negative consequences of cross-strait diplomatic competition and
will instead benefit from changes in the cross-strait situation.</P>
      <P>He also expects Taiwan's people to benefit as well.</P>
      <P>At the conclusion of his South Pacific tour, Ma stressed that he was committed
to making his "flexible diplomacy" strategy a success, pledging to lead Taiwan
out of its diplomatic isolation and to find an opening that will allow Taiwan's
people to receive respect when traveling abroad.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A rendition of Puccini's opera "Turandot" presented by renowned Chinese director
Zhang Yimou and staged in Taichung City in late March left an audience of 40,000
deeply moved, but it also invited criticism from some in Taiwan driven by a
political mentality.</P>
      <P>Members of the audience were captivated by Zhang's extravagant production,  but
the critics  from  the opposition  Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) gave a
thumbs-down to the organization of the staging of the opera.</P>
      <P>They used Turandot's final act, Nessun dorma (None shall sleep), to deride
Taichung Mayor Jason Hu -- who was instrumental in bringing the show to Taichung
-- as having "slept for eight years during his stint as mayor."</P>
      <P>We think the performance was not only a musical and visual feast for the
audience, it was also a rare and invaluable opportunity for local performers who
took part in the show to sharpen their skills.</P>
      <P>The Taichung City government  had previously  invited many world-renowned
artists to perform in Taichung, including Luciano Pavarotti in 2005 and Andrea
Bocelli in 2008, but none of the shows had been condemned by DPP critics.</P>
      <P>We wonder if the critics were unhappy with Zhang Yimou's presentation because
Zhang is a movie director from China and because the show was a copy of the
performance put on by Zhang at Beijing's Olympic Stadium, popularly known as the
Bird's Nest.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is a mature society, and its people should have the same opportunity as
others around the world to appreciate artistic masterpieces, which are common
assets of humankind. How wonderful it is for peoples to communicate and
understand each other through the beauty of the performing arts.</P>
      <P>It is not desirable for people to limit Taiwan's participation in the world's
artistic or cultural activities, and it is not necessary to view talent from
China cynically.</P>
      <P>Exchanges through cultural activities is one of the most peaceful and
constructive ways to cement cross-strait ties. If Chinese tourists could be
moved by watching "The Village," a play produced by theater director Stan Lai on
the lives of Nationalist military troops who moved to Taiwan after 1949 and
their children, why can't the Taiwanese appreciate an opera produced and
directed by a Chinese director with some magnanimity? (April 4, 2010)</P>

be a painter, the survey found.</P>
      <P>Only 10.7 percent of respondents, however, said they fulfilled their dreams and
were employed in a profession that was closely related to their childhood dream

    <HEADLINE>Talk of the day --Taiwan's stock market expected to surge this year</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>04/04/10  17:53:44
(By Y.L. Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>After Taiwan's benchmark stock index closed above 8,000 points last week,
analysts predicted that the momentum would likely continue, especially with less
than one month to go before the opening of the 2010 World Expo in Shanghai. They
expected a new high to be set in the second half of this year.</P>
      <P>The Taiex gained 12.84 points to close at 8,025.93 Friday, after breaking the
8,000-point mark the previous day.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from local media coverage of the issue:</P>
      <P>Economic Daily News:</P>
      <P>Tsao Tien-lun, vice president of Taiwan International Investment Management,
suggested that investors hold China-themed shares, because they are likely to
remain strong for the whole year.</P>
      <P>Stocks related to Apple's iPad, cloud computing and smart grid products are also
expected to have strong showings, Tsao added.</P>
      <P>He predicted that the local bourse's recent rally will continue, with the
benchmark Taiex soon breaking the previous year's high of 8,395.</P>
      <P>He was optimistic in part because foreign investors were net buyers of NT$113.1
billion in shares in March. Based on historical data, whenever foreign investors
buy a net NT$100 billion or more in shares in a month, share prices the
following month rise between 1-3 percent, Tsao said.</P>
      <P>But he also expressed concerns that the government's National Stabilization Fund
will withdraw from the stock market.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, some analysts attributed the recent rebound in the market to strong
corporate earnings in the technology sector.</P>
      <P>The first quarter is normally the industry's low season, but many companies
posted better-than-expected sales during the period, with the revenues of seven
LED manufacturers setting single-month highs in March.</P>
      <P>LED-backlit TV shipments are expected to exceed 30 million units this year, more
than 10 times the number shipped last year.</P>
      <P>Semiconductor and LED companies are also expected to see a significant boom in
their businesses due to high demand in China.</P>
      <P>LED manufacturer Elite Advance Laser Corporation (eLaser) is expected to post
March sales of more than NT$160 million, 200 percent higher than in the same
period last year. (April 4, 2010).</P>
      <P>Commercial Times:</P>
      <P>As there has been an increasing demand for LED, solar energy, aviation products,
electric vehicles and foodstuffs ahead of the Shanghai Expo slated to open May
1, shares related to these sectors have become popular recently and are set to
surge in the coming month, analysts said.</P>
      <P>For example, the share prices of Formosa Epitaxy Inc., a major indium gallium
nitride (InGaN) manufacturer, leading retailer Ruentex Industries, and
electronics distributors Synnex Technology and Tsann Kuen have risen
significantly because of strong sales related to the Shanghai Expo.</P>
      <P>The event, with will open in May, is expected to attract 70 million visitors, 10
times the number that visited Beijing for the Summer Olympics in 2008.</P>
      <P>Although the outlook for the local stock market this year is bright, the Taiex
will likely move in starts and stops in the short term before rebounding to
challenge the 10,000-point mark in the second half of this year, said Charles
Hsiao, president of Fubon Securities Investment Services Co.</P>
      <P>Hsiao said Q2 would be a good time for investors to jump into the market,  and
he suggested they focus their attention  on the performance of stock markets in
other countries, the signing of a proposed economic cooperation framework
agreement (ECFA) with China, the year-end five special municipality elections,
and domestic demand in China.</P>
      <P>He said the Taiex would likely hover between 8,107 and 8,395 in the near future.</P>
      <P>ECFA-themed stocks and shares in companies that produce iPad and upstream PC
components would outperform the overall market, Hsiao predicted.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Liu Kuan-hsi, general manager of Masterlink Securities Investment
Advisory Corp., predicted that the Taiex would hover between 7,500 and 8,000 in
the second quarter and would challenge the previous 2010 high of 8,395 later
this year.</P>
      <P>Liu said whether the Taiex could surpass the 9,000-point mark and test the
10,000-point threshold will depend on the government's policies and issues
related to the cross-Taiwan Strait ECFA and special municipality elections.</P>
      <P>Mobile phone, Internet, iPad, banking and financial issues as well as China-
themed stocks will have strong showings, he said. (April 4, 2010).</P>

    <HEADLINE>United Daily News: Prevailing corruption among professors</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>04/04/10  18:23:23
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A professor from National Cheng Kung University in Tainan was indicted recently
for inflating research expenses in her claim for reimbursement under a project
financed by the National Science Council.</P>
      <P>The defendant complained during the prosecutors' investigation that "a lot of
people do the same thing."</P>
      <P>Investigators should look into the indicted professor's claim that she was just
following a practice prevalent among professors, because her actions may only by
the tip of an iceberg.</P>
      <P>Local news reports cited a National Science Council official as saying that an
unnamed male professor even claimed reimbursement for expenses for sanitary
napkins. But this report was never verified.</P>
      <P>Professors may claim compensation for research expenses without limit but the
expenses should be somehow related to their studies, at least on the surface.
From what we know, there are loopholes in the current system that offer
professors chances to grease their palms.</P>
      <P>For example, in terms of consumables and miscellaneous expenses, the leader of a
research project may well collude with suppliers to claim reimbursement with
false invoices.</P>
      <P>Listing family members as research assistants to claim wages as part of the
project is another way to line one's pockets, but it's not the most ridiculous
claim, because it is not explicitly forbidden in existing regulations. The worst
is when professors claim wages for assistants who simply don't exist.</P>
      <P>We are not saying that these are practices followed by most professors or that
they highlight the low morale of scholars. We are simply pointing out that the
flawed mechanism used to finance research budgets has paved the way for the
waste of resources.</P>
      <P>Scholars who debase themselves by siphoning off research funds should not be
forgiven. But the money they have taken pales in comparison to the funds wasted
because of the program's poor design and lack of efficiency.</P>
      <P>Scholars used to be the most outspoken critics of corruption in the government.
They should now live up to the standards they once required of officials. (April

    <HEADLINE>Presidential Office keeps heat on DPP over DPP-era foreign policy</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  4 (CNA)
04/04/10  19:27:08

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Presidential Office continued to challenge the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) Sunday over its foreign policy approach while it was in
power from 2000-2008, in what may be a prelude to an upcoming debate over a
proposed trade pact with China.</P>
      <P>The offensive began Saturday when President Ma Ying-jeou's spokesman Lo Chih-
chiang said Ma will focus on the economic isolation caused by the DPP's policies
to buttress his support for a framework agreement on trade with China when he
debates the issue later this month.</P>
      <P>According to the Liberty Times, DPP Legislator Tsai Huang-liang later denied the
accusations that the DPP had adopted a "closed-door policy" that led to Taiwan's
isolation, citing the party's effort to push for Taiwan's WTO accession.</P>
      <P>Lo responded Sunday, however, that Taiwan actually began the push to join the
World Trade Organization (WTO) while the Kuomintang (KMT) was in power in the
late 1980s and that the DPP simply harvested the results of the KMT's efforts
when Taiwan gained admission to the world trade body in November 2001.</P>
      <P>The exchange reflects one of the fault lines likely to color the upcoming debate
between President Ma and DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen on the controversial
economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) with China.</P>
      <P>The president believes it is an essential first step in combating Taiwan's
economic marginalization while the DPP sees it as a trap that will leave the
country at China's mercy.</P>
      <P>Lo said Saturday the president will make the argument that an ECFA "is an
important step in breaking through the country's isolation created when the DPP
was in power."</P>
      <P>He added Sunday that the historical record will prove that Taiwan began efforts
to join the WTO's predecessor, the GATT, in 1987 when Vice President Vincent
Siew was serving as the director of the Bureau of Foreign Trade.</P>
      <P>Taiwan submitted an application for membership with the GATT's Secretariat in
1990, launching a 10-year process of bilateral and multilateral trade
negotiations with many countries around the world, Lo said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan was granted observer status by the GATT in 1992 and formally acceded to
the world trade body on January 1, 2002, Lo said.</P>
      <P>The spokesman added that Taiwan was the world's 14th leading exporter in the
world in 2002, but that the ranking continued to slide, to 17th in early 2009.</P>
      <P>"An assessment made by the Bureau of Foreign Trade concluded that Taiwan's
ranking could rebound back to at least 15th if the ECFA is signed and
implemented in the next year or two," Lo said.</P>
      <P>"Amid the rising global trend of regional integration  to facilitate trade and
economic development, how can Taiwan maintain its economic lifeline if it fails
to sign the trade pact with China?" he asked.</P>
      <P>The Ma administration has been pushing hard for the conclusion of the pact with
China out of concern that the country will be marginalized by being left out of
regional trade blocks.</P>
      <P>The DPP strongly opposes the pact, however, arguing that it will actually lead
to heavy job losses domestically and will undermine Taiwan's sovereignty.</P>

      <P>Merger and acquisition activity remained robust in Taiwan last year despite the

      <P>According to the official, 185 mergers and acquisitions worth NT$34.42 billion
(US$1.08 billion) were made last year, of which 84.3 percent were mergers. Most
of the deals came in the electronics sector.</P>
      <P>The high rate of mergers reflected the ambition of domestic enterprises to boost

the sizes of their companies, the official said.</P>
      <P>Since the Business Mergers And Acquisitions Act was promulgated Feb. 6,  2002,
there have been more than 1,300 mergers and acquisitions worth a total of NT$620

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih again pushed Sunday for speedy construction of permanent
housing for people displaced by Typhoon Morakot last August.</P>
      <P>"We hope all the permanent houses now under construction can be completed before
the end of July so that Morakot victims will be resettled in those houses by the
storm's first anniversary, " Wu said while inspecting a housing construction
project on Majia Farm in southern Taiwan's Pingtung County.</P>
      <P>The Majia housing project will accommodate aboriginal households from the
county's Haocha and Dashe villages, both of which were destroyed by Morakot-
triggered floodwaters and mudslides.</P>
      <P>The premier expressed his gratitude for the cooperation of Majia residents in
providing their land for the housing project and for the sponsorship of
Christian charity World Vision Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The charity's executive director, Hank Du,  said that 319 households have been
approved for settlement in the Majia Farm housing project to date.</P>
      <P>According to the premier, only those who filed applications before March 15 were
eligible to be resettled in the permanent houses to be built there.</P>
      <P>A model house has been completed, while other parts of the 30-hectare land are
being prepared for construction, Du said.</P>
      <P>Though completing construction of more than 300 houses at a high quality level
in four months is a big challenge for his organization, Du said his organization
will do its utmost to live up to the premier's expectations.</P>
      <P>Typhoon survivors from Haucha and Dashe villages will be hired to build their
new homes under an "employment substitution relief" program, Du said, and the
new houses will be environmentally friendly buildings, with each unit expected
to help reduce carbon emissions by 40 tons per year.</P>
      <P>In addition to residential houses,  nine churches and one elementary school will
be built on Majia Farm. A center dedicated to developing local agricultural
specialties will also be established to help residents start up new businesses
and earn a living on their own in the future.</P>

      <P>A stone stele that is inscribed with the Chinese characters "Sun Moon Lake" and
stands in front of a temple in the scenic area remains the most popular spot for
taking pictures among Chinese visitors to Taiwan, a local volunteer tour guide
said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The iconic monument has become a landmark in the Sun Moon Lake National Scenic
Area in Nantou County and always draws crowds of Chinese tourists, who treasure
pictures taken there as a special keepsake of their trip to the lake, according
to the tour guide.</P>
      <P>Although there are another four or five steles with the words "Sun Moon Lake" in
the area, the stone erected in front of Syuanguang Temple has attracted the
greatest interest of Chinese travelers, in part because the back of the stone
bears a sculpture depicting Tang Dynasty Dharma Xuan Zang's trip to fetch sutras
in the Western Heaven, the tour guide noted.</P>
      <P>It also provides a panoramic view of the lake.</P>
      <P>The scenic area is one of the must-see destinations for Chinese tourists
visiting Taiwan, and travel agencies will usually arrange for them a boat tour
of three major spots that of course includes Syuanguang Temple, along with Lalu
Island and Ita Thao, the village of the area's Thao Aborigines.</P>
      <P>According to the scenic area administration, about 3,000-4000 Chinese tourists
are expected to visit the area daily during the three-day Tomb Sweeping holiday,
which began April 3.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Mainland Affairs chief defends trade pact with China</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 4 (CNA)
04/04/10  21:19:36
(By Feng Chao and Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council Minister Lai Shin-yuan defended a proposed economic
cooperaton framework agreement (ECFA) with China Sunday in an interview with
cable station Sanlih E-Television (SETTV).</P>
      <P>The minister rebutted opposition Democratic Progressive Party claims that
Chinese agriculture products and workers will eventually be brought into Taiwan
according to rules of the World Trade Organization (WTO), despite the
government's promise to the contrary.</P>
      <P>The opposition party has argued that under WTO rules, ECFA is only a
transitional step toward a free trade agreement,  and signatories are obliged to
open their market to 95 percent of each other's commercial products and services
within 10 years.</P>
      <P>"There are no such rules under the World Trade Organization, and the DPP is well
aware of that," Lai said to SETTV, which tends to be critical of the government
and ruling Kuomintang.</P>
      <P>"No country in the world has opened its market completely to another state's
goods, and that's especially true for agricultural products. The United States
hasn't and neither has the European Union," Lai said.</P>
      <P>She also dismissed opponents' concerns that what Taiwan gains in the initial
rounds of negotiations -- thanks to China's promise to offer Taiwan concessions
-- will be lost later as it will be forced to compensate Beijing for the
concessions that were made.</P>
      <P>Lai said both Beijing and Taipei have realized the sharp difference in the size
of their economies and contended that China will not have more items than Taiwan
on a list of goods and services that will enjoy greater market access or
immediate tariff reductions or exemptions.</P>
      <P>Each side will seek their own maximum benefit when drawing up their lists of
products designated for preferential treatment, called the early harvest  list,
but the final list will depend on negotiations, the minister said.</P>
      <P>Lai said the proposed pact enjoys the support of about 50 percent of the people
according to various opinion polls, but the government, which is hoping for a
higher support rating, is still not satisfied.</P>
      <P>Noting that the complexity of such a pact is difficult for ordinary people to
understand, Lai said Japan has inked free trade pacts with other states when
polls showed only 10 percent of the people supported them.</P>
      <P>She also dismissed the idea of having an ad hoc team of lawmakers supervise the
government's engagement with China, saying existing mechanisms have provided
lawmakers with sufficient opportunity to discuss and supervise the executive
branch's work related to mainland China affairs.</P>
      <P>When asked why Chinese top negotiator Chen Yunlin referred her by her name
rather than her official title in their two public meetings, the minister said
she understood Chen's concerns as Taipei and Beijing have yet to acknowledge
each other officially, and the problem is not expected to be solved in the near
future.</P>
      <P>"He paid a visit on me because I am the head of the Mainland Affairs Council,
and the country's sovereignty is none the worse because of Chen's omission of my
title," Lai said.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou's administration has gone all out to push for the pact
with China -- and hopes to sign it in June -- to prevent Taiwan from being
economically marginalized as other states in the region form trade blocs.</P>
      <P>The initiative has drawn fire from the DPP, which believes the pact undermine
the country's sovereignty and provide Beijing with leverage in trying to annex
Taiwan, which it considers part of its territory.</P>

      <P>The Taiwanese modern theater group Riverbed Theatre Company performed "Flowers

Beaudelaire, for the first time in France on Saturday.</P>
      <P>Craig Quintero, artistic director of the Riverbed Theatre, which was founded  in

      <P>Magen said he was first impressed by the Riverbed Theatre's performances at the
Avignon-Off Festival in 2007 and 2008, so he invited the group to perform at the
Robert Desnos Cultural Center in the department of Essonne south of Paris last
year and to produce the "Flowers of E" in 2010.</P>

      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) said Sunday its planned
"10-year policy guidelines" are not being devised to replace the party's
platform but rather aimed at helping address the challenges Taiwan faces in the
coming decade.</P>

flexible strategies for resolving problems facing Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"While the party platform tends to be steady, our planned '10-year-policy
guidelines' will be subject to adjustment at our annual congress," Liu said.</P>
      <P>The party is scheduled to unveil its first-ever "10-year policy guidelines" at
its 2010 national congress to be held in August, Liu said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, he revealed the party will hold four seminars in the coming weeks to

      <P>The seminars will take place on April 11, April 22, April 24 and May 2,

      <P>Taiwan's top watchdog body, the Control Yuan, may censure supervisory agencies
for turning a blind eye to the irregular use of funds in the implementation of a
five-year NT$50 billion to upgrade the country's universities.</P>
      <P>Control Yuan member Ger Yeong-kuang said his office has asked the Ministry of
Audit to investigate a media report alleging that five elite universities,
including National Taiwan University (NTU), spent NT$117 million (US$3.68
million) in three and a half years on carbon cartridges for printers and ink
cartridges for printers, copiers and fax machines.</P>
      <P>The five-year NT$50 billion plan was launched in 2005 by the former Democratic
Progressive Party administration to help NTU and National Cheng Kung University
join the ranks of the world's first-class universities.</P>
      <P>Ten other universities, including National Tsing Hua University, were supported
under the plan to become leading research institutions in Asia.</P>
      <P>According to Ger,  a preliminary  investigation  has found irregularities in the
way the program's funds were used by some universities.</P>
      <P>But the irregularities could not yet be labeled "corruption" and had nothing to
do with university authorities, Ger said.</P>
      <P>"Project managers at the schools should be held responsible for the irregular
use of funds," he said.</P>
      <P>The investigation has also found that some professors filed expense claims for

    <HEADLINE>China Times: National security system needs overhaul</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>04/05/10  12:32:48
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>During a state visit to countries in the South Pacific in March, President Ma
Ying-jeou gave a directive for immediate activation of Taiwan's national
security mechanism immediately after he learned of the sinking of a South Korean
warship. Ma's decision was panned by critics as an overreaction.</P>
      <P>Only time will tell whether or not the critics were right. But one thing is sure
-- the country's national security system needs to be overhauled.</P>
      <P>We absolutely agree with the saying, "one cannot be too careful," particularly
when it comes to international  incidents  in a fast-changing world. Taiwan
cannot afford to be nonchalant about international incidents.</P>
      <P>However, we think the Ma administration should be criticized for issuing a
statement soon after the sinking of the vessel that "the president had fully
grasped the situation."</P>
      <P>No one in the world, not even the decision-makers at the White House, dared to
make that claim, given the complexity of the situation  on the Korean
peninsular  and Pyongyang's  lack of transparency.</P>
      <P>Because of the statement that "the president had fully grasped the situation"
and because of the fact that the information received by Taiwan's national
security system was too late, inaccurate and from "other media," we are
concerned that the system is shaky.</P>
      <P>The national security system, under the Ma administration, has a structural
problem that needs to be fixed -- it is functioning more like an advisory body
to the president than as an action agency.</P>
      <P>There is probably no need for Taiwan to become a global strategic nerve center
like Washington, but it has its own regional issues to address, including
emergency rescue and relief efforts, interactions across the Taiwan Strait, the
problem of sea pirates, and assistance to foreign nationals and overseas
compatriots.</P>
      <P>The National Security Council needs to be converted into a security and
intelligence nerve center, where even middle- and low-echelon officials would be
capable of collecting intelligence, coordinating and performing on their own.

      <P>Discarded glass bottles along rural roadsides also pose a danger to farmers with
plots close by.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from local media coverage of the garbage disposal
issue:</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>The arbitrary dumping of empty pesticide containers near the watershed areas in
central Taiwan's greater Lishan mountain area is endangering the safety of the
water supply to metropolitan Taichung, Changhua and Nantou which lie at the foot
of the mountains.</P>
      <P>In March, a garbage collection site in Heping township, Taichung County was seen
piled high with trash, mostly from farmers who grow vegetables and fruits in the
mountains. It took garbage disposal crews more than 10 days to clear the site.</P>
      <P>Some farmers in the high-altitude farming district of Huakang in the mountains
between Taichung County and Nantou County never sort their trash, according to a
township official Huang Chieh. These farmers mix in toxic pesticide containers
with normal waste, he said.</P>
      <P>The Huakang farming district is located in the watershed area between the Hehuan
and Begang rivers. Along the mountain road, one can see "garbage waterfalls"
stretching 300-400 meters from the road to the river banks. The hillsides are
almost bare. Even insects are rarely seen there.</P>
      <P>But according to Chang Wen-teh, head of Tsueiluan Village in Nantou County, the
garbage that is seen on the hillsides is probably much less than what is buried
under the earth and weeds.</P>
      <P>Chang said garbage is polluting the Hehuan River, which is one of the main
branches of the Tajia River that supplies water to residents of the greater
Taichung area. The farmers on the greater Lishan mountains are usually not
aboriginals but rather mostly developers from Yilan and Taichung whose only
concern is to make a profit, he said.</P>
      <P>They usually pull out after they have earned enough money, leaving the residents
of the area to deal with bare slopes and toxic waste, Chang complained.</P>
      <P>Because there are no laws stipulating that pesticide containers must be
recycled, "there is no designated area on the mountains for the collection of
empty pesticide bottles, " said Lai Sheng-kung, chairman of the Lishan community
development association.</P>
      <P>"Nonetheless, some environmentally conscious farmers usually take their
pesticide containers to the towns at the foot of the mountain," said Lai. "But
those without a social conscience throw the bottles directly down the
hillsides." (April 5, 2010).</P>
      <P>Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>Chung Tzi-lang, 78, owns a farm that borders a provincial road in Yunlin
County's Lunbei township. His property is often littered with energy drink
bottles thrown from passing vehicles.</P>
      <P>Chung has twice sustained cuts on his hands from broken glass bottles on his
farm. This has forced him to file a complaint with the Executive Yuan.</P>
      <P>After collecting more than 70 discarded bottles on Chung's farm, the
Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) inspectors admitted that "the
problem is serious" and it appealed to people's social conscience.</P>
      <P>According to EPA statistics, the volume of unrecycled glass bottles amounts to
45,000 tons per year. Based on an estimated weight of 500 grams per bottle,
there are some 90 million bottles "lying around" outside the recycling system
every year, which poses a big threat to farmers, it said. (April 5, 2010).</P>

    <HEADLINE>Commercial Times: Learn from U.S., Korean job creation initiatives</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>04/05/10  13:55:44
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A proposal to add a clause to the disputed Industrial Innovation Bill that would
give subsidies to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) for new hirings has
been harshly criticized as a waste of taxpayers' money and an example of pork
barrel politics.</P>
      <P>However, we believe the proposal is a necessary and legitimate step, similar to
the job promotion measures adopted in the United States and South Korea recently
to address their unemployment problems.</P>
      <P>The U.S. Senate passed a bill 10 days ago that would offer up to US$17.6 billion
in social security tax exemption for American companies that hire people who
have been out of work for more than 60 days. If people in this category are
hired for more than one year, their employers will be given an additional
US$1,000 in tax refund. The bill was initiated by the Democratic Party and
secured the support of 11 opposition Republican senators.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, South Korea is implementing a short-term employment promotion program
that provides financial aid for SMEs that hire new workers, and is also planning
to offer tax incentives to create more jobs.</P>
      <P>These initiatives are an indication that encouraging SMEs to hire more workers
has gradually become an important policy of major countries around the world,
amid rising unemployment associated with economic globalization. The main
reasoning behind this development is that SMEs tend to be labor-intensive
industries that have a strong potential to create jobs.</P>
      <P>Article 20 of the draft Industrial Innovation Bill reflects a global trend and
deserves the support of lawmakers from the ruling and opposition camps.</P>
      <P>SMEs have traditionally formed the backbone of our economy. According to a 2006
commercial and industrial census, local SMEs only used 22 percent of national
resources and employed 64 percent of the country's workforce. If the number of
employers was also included, local SMEs accounted for 76.6 percent of Taiwan's
total working population.</P>
      <P>Nonetheless, the government allowed more than NT$1 trillion in tax reductions
and exemptions for the high-tech sector between 1993 and 2008 under the now
defunct statute on encouraging industrial upgrade. Why has no one ever
questioned the propriety of such concessions to the high-tech sector?</P>
      <P>The time has come for those who look down on SMEs to change their way of
thinking in order to right the imbalances in global economic development. (April

      <P>Former Japanese Prime Minister Taro Aso and his family arrived in Taiwan Monday
for a four-day private visit.</P>
      <P>Upon his arrival at Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport, Aso was greeted by
John Feng, Taiwan's representative to Tokyo, and Tadashi Imai, Japan's
representative to Taipei.</P>
      <P>Aso was seen chatting animatedly with Feng, but did not respond to press
inquiries about his itinerary in Taiwan, nor did he make any public speeches. He
shook hands with some Japanese visitors at the airport.</P>
      <P>Accompanied by his wife, daughter and personal aides, Aso left the airport for
Taipei shortly after his arrival.</P>
      <P>According to a report carried in the Monday edition of the Japanese Sankei
Shimbun, Aso is visiting Taiwan at the invitation of Taiwanese friends.</P>
      <P>The report quoted Aso as having told the Japanese Diet that during his visit he
would look at Taiwan's political development.</P>
      <P>This is Aso's first trip to Taiwan since he stepped down as premier last
September after his party lost a parliamentary election to the Democratic Party
of Japan in August 2009.</P>
      <P>Aso, who served as Japan's prime minister from September 2008 through September
2009, last visited Taiwan in April 2003 in his capacity as head of the then-
ruling Liberal Democratic Party's policy coordination council. During that
visit, he attended a seminar with politicians from Taiwan's then-ruling
Democratic Progressive Party.</P>
      <P>Only two other retired Japanese prime ministers have ever visited Taiwan. The
late Japanese Prime Minister Take Fukuda visited Taiwan in March 1992, and
former Japanese Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori visited Taiwan in December 2003 and

    <TEXT>
      <P>Private activist groups that have been pressing for a boycott of the passage of
an industrial innovation bill urged the legislature Monday to put the brakes on
its passage and review it again "before it is too late."</P>
      <P>Ruling Kuomintang (KMT) legislators were scheduled to meet their counterparts
from the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) the following day for
negotiations over the bill, which failed to clear the legislative floor in late
March due to a filibuster by DPP lawmakers.</P>
      <P>Wang Jung-chang, convener of the Fairtax Alliance, said the bill, which
continues and expands concessionary tax rates for major industrial investors, is
full of injustice and partiality.</P>
      <P>"The bill is not only unfair to smaller business and industrial operators, it
will also result in the depletion of the country's tax revenues," Wang
contended.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, lawyer Chan Shun-kuei, who is a representative of the Taiwan Rural
Front, said Article 10 of the industrial innovation bill, which relaxes
restrictions on the establishment of industrial parks or zones, is the most
controversial one.</P>
      <P>Under that article, Chan said, any government agency, public enterprise or
private individual can apply to develop and run an industrial park so long as a
development plan is produced. The government will help acquire the land -- even
state-owned tracts of land, he added.</P>
      <P>"The bill is poised to allow big business conglomerates to steal the homelands
of disadvantaged commoners through a land expropriation program," he claimed.</P>
      <P>Chan urged the KMT-dominated legislature to suspend the passage of the bill and
review the more controversial articles again.</P>
      <P>He added that the Taiwan Rural Front will organize another press conference
April 7 to allow potential victims to voice their outrage over the bill.</P>
      <P>In response to the call from the private groups, Lin Yi-shih, head of the KMT
Policy Committee, said the ruling party respects the opinions of those in the
private sector, but he also invited them to look back to see how the domestic
economy benefited from the Statute for Industrial Upgrading that expired at the
end of 2009 and that also provided tax breaks to industrial investors from home
and abroad.</P>
      <P>The country  might lose some revenue  because of the tax incentives, he
conceded, but added that the bill will also attract funds from abroad that will
create job opportunities and generate more tax revenues.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Apple Daily: Tomb-sweeping tradition</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>04/05/10  16:20:53
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Is it time to re-examine the tradition of sweeping the tombs of ancestors and
offering sacrifices, in light of the fact that Taiwan is no longer an agrarian
society?</P>
      <P>The ancient custom has been maintained for 2,000 to 3,000 years in Chinese
society based on the teachings of Confucius. "Let there be a careful attention
to perform the funeral rites to parents and let them be followed when long gone
with the ceremonies of sacrifice, then the virtue of the people will resume its
proper excellence, " Confucian analects state.</P>
      <P>In ancient times, this was one way for the Chinese empire to keep the people in
submission. The thinking was that those who showed filial obedience could be
persuaded to transfer that piety to their emperors. Discontinuation of such
politically expedient training was not allowed even after the death of one's
parents.</P>
      <P>However, the practice could only remain rooted in a farming society where most
of the population was bound to the land. Many family tombs were built close to
the homes or farms so that the descendants could offer sacrifices regularly and
pass on the rituals to younger generations easily.</P>
      <P>However, in today's modern society, many ancient tombs have been abandoned as
the descendants have moved far away.</P>
      <P>Traditionally, Chinese people prefer to bury their dead on scenic hillsides, a
practice that has resulted in the disfigurement of many beautiful mountains in
Taiwan. In scenic areas like Yangmingshan in suburban Taipei, forests were
cleared to make room for tombs, which now look like medicine paste on wounds.</P>
      <P>Luckily, more and more Taiwan people are choosing cremation over burial. The
pagodas in which ashes are stored are much more environmentally friendly and
easier on the eyes than tombs.</P>

      <P>Most people do not find jobs closely related to what they focused on in college

      <P>The survey, conducted by the 104 job bank on people who graduated in the last
five years, found that only 25.6 percent of respondents said they were employed
in a profession closely related to their major in college or university.</P>
      <P>About 52.4 percent of respondents who had studied the arts said their work was

      <P>The Chinese version of the London-based The Big Issue magazine -- a magazine
sold by homeless people on the streets -- was launched in Taiwan recently,
facing unknown prospects.</P>
      <P>Fines Lee, founder and editor-in-chief of the Chinese version, said he and his
partners are bracing for challenges of all kinds running the magazine, at a time
when online literature and electronic books are flourishing while traditional
printed publications are on the wane.</P>
      <P>"Each step is a challenge for us, " said Lee, whose magazine has a staff of
three, including himself.</P>
      <P>Even though many of his friends have painted an uncertain picture of his new
business,  Lee,  an Internet whiz and founder of Blog.Roodo.com -- an online
chatroom for art and culture -- said that running the magazine provides him with
a clear sense of direction and at the same time helps homeless people, called
"street friends" in Mandarin in Taiwan, regain their dignity.</P>
      <P>The Chinese version of The Big Issue magazine -- the first social business model
of its kind in Taiwan -- made its debut April 1, with an inaugural print run of
100,000 copies.</P>
      <P>Lee said his company had so far recruited 30 homeless people willing to be the
first group of vendors selling the magazine at 29 exits of the Mass Rapid
Transit (MRT) system in Taipei City and Taipei County.</P>
      <P>Each of them were given 20 free copies to help them kick start their own
operations. After that, the vendors will earn NT$50 (US$1.6) from the sale of
each magazine, which is priced at NT$100, Lee said.</P>
      <P>Lee's company has also recruited volunteers to help monitor the vendors to
prevent undesired behavior or to help them sell, he said.</P>
      <P>The magazine, written in a populist style featuring sci-tech products, fashion
trends, design, environmental issues, essays, culture, travel and the performing
arts, is also available at convenience stores in other parts of Taiwan, he
added.</P>
      <P>"The next issue of the magazine will be published May 1 and we hope to publish
every two weeks after that, " he said.</P>
      <P>Yang Kuang-ming, a homeless man who became jobless two years ago and was reduced
to getting free lunches at a Taipei church, said selling the magazine was like
riding a roller coaster.</P>
      <P>"I sold 10 copies in a short period of time one day, but sold only one in
several hours on another day," he said.</P>
      <P>He said it takes time to attract customers. "At present, they don't buy it
because the magazine is unknown to them," he noted.</P>
      <P>Enlightened by the magazine's spirit of helping people, Yang said he has started
to donate NT$5 from each magazine he sells to the church that fed him.</P>
      <P>"Now I'm able to help people who are more disadvantaged than me," he noted.</P>
      <P>There were some 3,800 homeless people on record in Taiwan in 2009, 1,300 of whom
were in Taipei City and Taipei County, according to Lee.</P>
      <P>The social enterprise model was created in 1991 by John Bird, the founder of the
U.K. Big Issue, and has helped more than 10,000 disadvantaged and homeless
people there, Lee said.</P>
      <P>In the U.K., 147,000 copies of the weekly magazine are sold, serving a
readership of over 670,000 people, Lee said.</P>
      <P>The weekly magazine is also sold in other countries, including Japan, Australia
and South Africa. Taiwan is the ninth market in the world to sell the magazine.

      <P>Kaohsiung City's Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) Bureau plans to issue a travel card at
the end of this month to offer a range of preferential services, with the aim of
boosting MRT passenger volume, Chen Kai-ling, director-general of the bureau,
said Monday.</P>
      <P>The city government will use its air pollution control fund to finance the card,
which will be valid for payment of travel by air, high speed rail, conventional
train, Kaohsiung MRT, bus and ferry, according to Chen.</P>
      <P>If cardholders make good use of the various special offers that will come with
the card, they would be able to get discounts of up to 40 percent on Kaohsiung
MRT fares, compared to the 15 percent discount offered to I-Pass holders.</P>
      <P>The MRT bureau will target mainly corporate commuters, Chen said, adding that
employees who apply for the card through their companies will get the best
discounts for travel on the Kaohisung MRT.</P>
      <P>In addition, for each NT$200 put on the stored value card by consumers, the city
will add NT$50, Chen said.</P>
      <P>The MRT bureau has signed contracts with six companies to pave the way of the
issuing of the card, he said.</P>
      <P>Since the Kaohsiung Rapid Transit Corp. (KRTC) launched the I-Pass in 2008, the
number of cards in circulation has reached 1.5 million. The I-Pass was designed
to pay fares on the city's metro, bus and ferry services.</P>
      <P>Apart from the I-Pass, the KRTC, in collaboration with some banks, has issued a
joint-brand card but it is not popular because of its limited functions.</P>

      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) recently released drafted regulations on labeling
products in Taiwan that stipulate instant beef noodles cannot be called "beef
noodles" if they do not contain beef.</P>
      <P>Under the drafted regulations, which were proposed based on the Act Governing
Food Sanitation, the labeling of instant noodle products should reflect the
actual content of the packaging.</P>
      <P>Noodle products must include an "ingredient parcel" containing beef or shrimp if
they are to be labeled "beef noodles" or "shrimp noodles, " said Liu Fang-ming,
an official at the DOH's Food and Drug Administration.</P>
      <P>"Without the ingredients, they can only be called 'beef noodle soup' or 'shrimp-
flavored soup'," Liu said.</P>
      <P>The new regulations were drafted after consumers complained that pictures on
packages of instant noodle products did not match the food in the packages, he
added.</P>
      <P>Asked why the proposal failed to define the amount of meat required, Liu said
that it was because the administration found that different people have
different definitions on the size.</P>
      <P>However, measures will be reinforced to ensure products contain the ingredients
advertised on their packages, the official said.</P>
      <P>A preliminary notice of the proposal was made on April 1. A formal notice of the
drafted regulations, which stipulate that violators can be fined between
NT$30,000 and NT$150,000, could come as soon as May 1, according to the DOH.</P>
      <P>The new rules would take effect one year after the formal notice, the department

      <P>The 21-year-old Tseng shot a final round 68 Sunday for a total of 275 at Mission
Hills Country Club to hold off the Norwegian by one shot.</P>
      <P>The Taiwanese opened a four-shot lead after shooting a 32 on the front nine, but
a cautious finish of six straight pars down the stretch, when she admittedly did
not play aggressively enough nearly let Pettersen back into the tournament.</P>
      <P>It was the second major title of her career, after winning the McDonalds LPGA
Championship in 2008 as a rookie. This one, she said, had a different feel to
the win two years ago.</P>
      <P>"Last time I won a major, I didn't feel anything. I didn't feel like I could win
a tournament, " she said.</P>
      <P>"But this week I knew I had a chance to win, so I called my coach, my short game
coach, my long game coach, my psychologist to see what I should think about
today, because I was really nervous and playing ahead."</P>
      <P>She also credited one of the LPGA Tour's greatest players ever for helping her
with the mental aspect of the game.</P>
      <P>"I really want to thank Annika Sorenstam because she came to my house and we sat
down and talked about two hours. She helped me a lot on my game, about the
mental side," Tseng said.</P>
      <P>"(She said) everything outside the ropes you need to just get rid of. When you
get inside the ropes, you just want to have fun and play golf, and you don't
want to think about too much."</P>
      <P>Her latest win is expected to propel Tseng into the top five in the Rolex World
Rankings after starting last week ranked sixth, and she also moved into the top
spot in the standings for the highly coveted LPGA Player of the Year award,
ahead of Miyazato and Pettersen.</P>
      <P>Tseng also became the birdie leader on the LPGA Tour, with 64, or an average of
four per round, for the first four tournaments of the year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwanese illustrator extends his reach beyond Asia</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 5 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwanese illustrator Jimmy Liao has enjoyed unparalleled success over the past
decade in the Far East, but his recent collaborations with British and American
publishers on children's books show that his drawings speak a universal
language.</P>
      <P>The well-known author-illustrator, known popularly as simply "Jimmy," started
his career by depicting the lives of ordinary people coping in the modern urban
world, and works based on that theme became big hits in Taiwan, Shanghai, Hong
Kong, Singapore and many other Asian markets during the past 10 years.</P>
      <P>Building on that success, he is now extending his reach by illustrating
children's books written by English-language writers.</P>
      <P>His first collaboration with an American publisher -- "I Can be Anything" -- was
published last month, said his agent Lee Yusan.</P>
      <P>He hopes it will earn him the same acclaim as his first project with the West,
"The Monster Who Ate Darkness," published last year by U.K.-based publisher
Walker Books for children above three years old.</P>
      <P>Written by English author Joyce Dunbar, the book tells the story of a tiny
monster that lives under a child's bed and discovers it likes to eat darkness.</P>
      <P>"The book has now been translated into Chinese, and is doing very well in the
Chinese market, which has been a surprise to the English publisher, " said Lee,
who attributed the success to Jimmy's many fans there.</P>
      <P>In a previous press conference, the shy illustrator admitted that drawing for
children has always been his dream, and his output reflects his passion.</P>
      <P>His abundant creativity came through in "I Can Be Anything, " an imaginative
joyride about hopes and dreams that was written by Newbery-Award winning
American author Jerry Spinelli and published by Little, Brown and Company.</P>
      <P>And there's more to come.</P>
      <P>"Readers will not need to wait too long to see the Jimmy's third work, which has
been completed and sent to Walker Books, " revealed Lee, who has been
responsible for promoting Jimmy's art and related products to other parts of
Asia.</P>
      <P>In addition to pitching his books, Lee is also organizing a "Jimmy art center"
in Taipei that will incorporate the illustrator's art and ideas in the center's
design and decor.</P>
      <P>"I hope the center can open in the first half of the year, " Lee said.</P>
      <P>Jimmy's success has been largely driven by his own creativity, hard work, and
Lee's help. But a major blow he suffered 15 years ago, when he was diagnosed
with leukemia, marked a turning point in his life -- and work -- that only added
to his drawings' appeal.</P>
      <P>His depictions of people became proportionally smaller, a kind of recognition
that they could not change the big world, but they face life and the world with
grace and a positive attitude.</P>
      <P>That may be the main reason why his works move and resonate with readers and
provide them with comfort, one reviewer suggested.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou will meet privately with former Japanese Prime Minister
Taro Aso, who arrived Monday in Taiwan on a four-day private visit, political
sources said.</P>
      <P>Aso, accompanied by his wife, daughter and personal aides, is making his first
trip to Taiwan since he stepped down as premier last September  after his
Liberal  Democratic  Party (LDP)  lost a parliamentary election a month earlier
to the Democratic Party of Japan.</P>
      <P>Although the LDP is no longer in power, sources said Aso still holds enormous
sway in the Japanese political arena. His visit to Taiwan has drawn considerable
attention because many believe he can help bridge Taipei-Tokyo relations.</P>
      <P>Given his sensitive status as a retired prime minister and the absence of
diplomatic ties between Taiwan and Japan, Aso kept a low profile after arriving
Monday.</P>
      <P>He did not respond to press inquiries about his itinerary in Taiwan and did not
make any public comments. He was seen chatting animatedly with John Feng,
Taiwan's representative to Japan, who returned to Taipei earlier in the day to
welcome Aso at Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport.</P>
      <P>Neither the Presidential Office nor the Ministry of Foreign Affairs would
confirm that Ma will meet Aso during the latter's visit.</P>
      <P>Sources have said, however, that Aso will not only meet with Ma but also with
other Taiwanese political heavyweights, including Legislative Speaker Wang Jin-
pyng.</P>
      <P>Wang, who has maintained close ties with the Japanese political community, will
invite Aso to dinner Wednesday, and ruling Kuomintang legislators with Japanese
educational backgrounds will also be present.</P>
      <P>Aso is visiting Taiwan at the invitation of Chinatrust Group Chairman Jeffrey
Koo.</P>
      <P>Aso, who served as Japan's prime minister from September 2008 through September
2009, last visited Taiwan in April 2003 in his capacity as head of the then-
ruling LDP's policy coordination council.</P>
      <P>During that visit, he attended a seminar with politicians from Taiwan's
Democratic Progressive Party, which held power at the time.</P>
      <P>Only two other retired Japanese prime ministers have visited Taiwan. Takeo
Fukuda visited Taiwan in March 1992 and Yoshiro Mori visited Taiwan in December
2003 and again in November 2006.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Tourism Bureau under the Ministry of Transportation and Communications
(MOTC) launched a new sightseeing tour bus service Monday enabling tourists to
cheaply and easily travel to famous scenic spots around Taiwan, bureau officials
announced Monday.</P>
      <P>The bus services run every 60 minutes during weekdays and every 30 minutes at
weekends, with the distinctive red bus stops providing bus information in both
Chinese and English, according to the bureau.</P>
      <P>Addressing the launch ceremony of the service, Minister of Transportation and
Communications Mao Chi-kuo said he hopes travel in Taiwan can become more public
transport- friendly because people can easily board these connecting buses at
Taiwan Railway Administration train stations or Taiwan High Speed Rail stations.</P>
      <P>A total of 20 bus lines are planned for 10 counties and cities, with nine of
them scheduled to begin service immediately.</P>
      <P>To promote the services, the Jiaosi and Dung Shan River lines in Yilan County
are offering free services until December, while in Tainan City, the Anping and
the Taijiang lines are providing free services until July.</P>
      <P>The other lines that began operating Monday are the Cihu Line in Taoyuan County,
the Sun Moon Lake Line in Nantou County, the Alishan Line in Chiayi County, the
City Tour Line in Chiayi City, and the Kenting Line in Pingtung County.</P>
      <P>The fare on the Kenting Line, which connects the High Speed Rail station in
Kaohsiung and ends in Kenting, is NT$407 -- the most expensive of all the new
lines.</P>
      <P>The remaining 11 lines will start operating by the end of June and will take
tourists to popular sightseeing spots such as Taroko, Green Island and Shitou.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The state-run Taiwan Power Co. (Taipower) said Monday that it was striving to
begin operation at the fourth nuclear power plant by National Day next year.</P>
      <P>Taipower confirmed media reports that Premier Wu Den-yih hopes the company can
move the schedule ahead two months -- from the end of next year to Oct. 10, the
centennial of the Wuchang Uprising that led to the downfall of China's Qing
Dynasty government and the birth of the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>Tu Yueh-yuan, chief engineer of Taipower, said that she is "cautiously
optimistic" that the company can achieve the target, adding that it will ensure
the construction of the Taipei County plant meets the highest safety standards.</P>
      <P>Over 80 percent of the construction of the power plant -- formally named the
Lungmen Nuclear Power Plant -- is complete, Tu said, adding that the project is
only a very small bit behind schedule.</P>
      <P>Tu said that the plant would have to undergo testing by the Cabinet-level
Atomic Energy Council before starting commercial operation, so that there is no
need to worry about safety.</P>
      <P>Construction of the power plant has caused strong protests from anti-nuclear
activists and residents living in the vicinity of the power plant in Gongliao,
northern Taiwan's Taipei County.</P>
      <P>During the previous Democratic Progressive Party administration, construction
was temporarily  suspended in 2000 in line with then-President Chen Shui-bian's
campaign promise to create a nuclear- free Taiwan. But the suspension was lifted
in early 2001 after the administration came under pressure from the legislature
and segments of society. A consensus was reached that the fourth nuclear plant
would be the last one.</P>

      <P>A number of companies in Taiwan have won the hearts of local customers by
relocating their customer services from China to Taiwan, a local newspaper said
Monday.</P>
      <P>"Customers have many technical problems with Canon's digital cameras and it is
easier to communicate with them through the customer service system being set up
in Taiwan, " Jesse Su, a senior general manager at Canon Taiwan, told Taiwan's
Chinese-language United Daily News.</P>
      <P>Canon  Taiwan  has seen a rise in the level of customer satisfaction since it
relocated customer service to Taiwan from Hong Kong in September last year, Su
said.</P>
      <P>This also helped the Japanese company sell more high-end cameras in Taiwan last
year, Su noted.</P>
      <P>BenQ Corp., a Taiwanese consumer electronics maker, also saw greater levels of
customer satisfaction after relocating their customer service line from China to
Taiwan, the report said.</P>
      <P>Cultural difference is a major factor that hurts customer satisfaction when a
company outsources its service calls from Taiwan to China, said Jerry Peng, the
general manager of BenQ's customer service in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Some Chinese employees, for example, did not used to know what "3G"  meant  as
China  launched  the  third-generation  mobile communications technology several
years after Taiwan, Peng said.</P>
      <P>Chinese employees were also not familiar with some of the popular Taiwanese
terms that came up during conversations and were often unable to correctly write
down Taiwanese customers' postal addresses, he added.</P>
      <P>The relocation from China to Taiwan did not increase BenQ's costs after the
company streamlined operational procedures, the report said.</P>
      <P>In a related United Daily News report, a Taiwanese consumer surnamed Chang said
that a Chinese service-call employee wrongly typed her name on the product
package delivered to her even though she had explained how to write her name
several times over the phone.</P>
      <P>"It's probably because the employee uses simplified Chinese and did not
understand what I said," she said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of National Defense (MND) denied a media report Monday that each
military officer could get a 10 percent pay raise after the preferential tax
treatment given to military personnel is eliminated, as early as next year.</P>
      <P>Military members and school teachers have long been exempt from paying taxes on
their income, but the Apple Daily reported that the Executive Yuan is expected
to abolish the tax break next year.</P>
      <P>The report said that to compensate military personnel for the tax policy change,
the MND has finalized a scheme to raise the salaries of all service members,
based on the principle of raising pay by the same amount levied in income taxes.</P>
      <P>As a result, the report said, each military officer could get an estimated 10
percent or even higher pay raise.</P>
      <P>The MND said in a statement Monday, however, that the report was not factual
because the ministry has yet to finalize any salary adjustment scheme.</P>
      <P>According to an Executive Yuan policy directive passed in 2002, the MND said it
will draft a salary adjustment package in line with the principle of no
reductions in service members' income after the Legislative Yuan completes legal
amendments and sets a date for enforcement of the new taxation rules.</P>
      <P>The draft package of income tax amendments is still pending legislative
approval.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a report carried in the Monday edition of the China Times said the
government's personnel expenditure will increase by at least NT$24 billion
annually after an all-volunteer military service system takes effect in 2014.</P>
      <P>Based on that estimate, the country's more than 5 million households that file
taxes will pay an additional NT$4,000 in income tax per year to help finance the
all-volunteer system, the report said.</P>
      <P>Responding to the report, the MND said the government's personnel expenditures
will increase in a steady manner based on the military's well-devised
recruitment system.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the all-volunteer service system will help reduce training and
operational costs because service members will stay longer in the military and
thus become more adept at operating weaponary systems.</P>
      <P>Such a reduction  will help offset increases in personnel expenditure, the
ministry argued.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's first large man-made lake project is simply aimed at stabilizing the
water supply in southern Taiwan, a water resources official said Monday.</P>
      <P>Joses Y. H. Wu, deputy director of the Water Resources Agency (WRA) under the
Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA), made the remark to rebut claims by some
environmental groups that the Jiyang Lake project is aimed at benefiting gravel
industry operators.</P>
      <P>When a project to dig five man-made lakes in an area straddling Kaohsiung and
Pingtung counties was proposed five years ago, Wu said, the 72 million cubic
meters of gravel expected to be extracted were considered an important resource
for southern Taiwan, because the region faced a shortage of gravel for the
construction industry.</P>
      <P>However, Wu said, the picture has changed greatly after Typhoon Morakot wreaked
havoc in southern Taiwan last August. Since then, more than 15 million cubic
meters of gravel have been dredged from the Cishan and Laonong rivers, which
flow into the Gaoping River, to date.</P>
      <P>As a result, southern Taiwan has stopped importing gravel from China and will
likely not have to do so over the next three to five years.</P>
      <P>Out of environmental concerns, however, the MOEA has decided to cut the number
of man-made lakes to be dug in the region from five to only two, Wu said.</P>
      <P>Noting that the Jiyang man-made lake project has been approved by the MOEA, the
Council for Economic Planning and Development and the Environmental Protection
Administration, Wu said the project is simply aimed at helping stabilize the
water supply in southern Taiwan, which has often been troubled by water
shortages.</P>
      <P>The proposed lakes will be able to conserve river water during the rainy season
and restrain land subsidence by reducing the extraction of groundwater. During
the dry season, it will serve as a supplementary source of water, Wu said.</P>
      <P>According to the WRA's plan, the project will get under way in 2011, with a
budget of NT$17 billion. The new lakes will be able to store 20 million cubic
meters of water.</P>

Jason Hu and KMT Legislator Chi Kuo-tung.</P>
      <P>The KMT recently passed regulations regarding the nominations of candidates for
the year-end five municipalities -- crucial because they are considered the
forerunner of the 2012 presidential election.</P>
      <P>According to the regulations, if more than one candidate wishes to run, the

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan's benefits should be priority in ECFA talks: official</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 5 (CNA)
04/05/10  23:41:50

    <TEXT>
      <P>A government official said Monday that the most important aspect of signing a
proposed cross-strait economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) is not
whether to hold talks with China, but to ensure the negotiations were conducted
with Taiwan's best interests in mind.</P>
      <P>Bureau of Foreign Trade Director-General Huang Chih-peng said in a televised
debate that last week's second round of talks proved Taiwan was upholding its
basic principles during negotiations.</P>
      <P>Huang said that Taiwan's major trade partners will only talk with Taiwan on free
trade agreements (FTAs)  after Taiwan resolves political issues with China and
that there is a "very high" possibility these partners would ink FTAs with
Taiwan if the cross-strait ECFA is signed.</P>
      <P>Huang made the arguments while teaming up with Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator Lai
Shyh-bao against two former Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) legislators --
Chuang Suo-hang and Julian Kuo -- in the debate broadcast by CtiTV as a prelude
to a planned debate between President Ma Ying-jeou and DPP Chairperson Tsai Ing-
wen.</P>
      <P>When audience  members asked whether  Taiwan should accept concessions from
China, Huang said that Taiwan's negotiators will seek to maximize benefits and
minimize any potential negative impact on local industries at the negotiation
table.</P>
      <P>The objective of signing the all-encompassing ECFA is to help local business
expand into the Chinese market, he added.</P>
      <P>If Taiwan and China want to exchange early harvest lists to allow goods that
each side will open for immediate tariff concessions, they have to sign the ECFA
under World Trade Organization rules, which allows bilateral arrangements under
comprehensive trade agreements, Huang said.</P>
      <P>Otherwise, if the two countries signed industry-specific deals rather than a
broader trade deal, they would be obligated to offer the same preferential
treatment to all WTO members based on the "most-favored nation" principle.</P>
      <P>Lai also said that he believes the accord would benefit both the country and the
ordinary people, adding that the ECFA may "not be a panacea, but a pain-killer,
a booster shot."</P>
      <P>Kuo said that the DPP is not opposed to signing trade agreements with China, but
favored conducting single-issue negotiations.</P>
      <P>If Taiwan only signs an ECFA with China, Kuo said, it would be marginalized and
overly reliant on China because China has inked FTAs with many countries in the
world, but Taiwan has failed to do so.</P>
      <P>He suggested that Taiwan sign the trade pact with China and FTAs with many other
countries at the same time by taking the same approach as when Taiwan joined the
WTO in 2002.</P>
      <P>Kuo also questioned whether the government underestimated the negative impact
that allowing China's services sector to operate in Taiwan could cause the local
retail industry.</P>
      <P>The most important issues facing the country now are high unemployment and
sluggish investment that cannot be resolved by signing the trade pact with
China, Kuo contended.</P>
      <P>Representatives from the local textile industry expressed their support for the
proposed ECFA, saying that Taiwan would have the chance to join the ASEAN Plus
Three economic bloc after signing the trade accord with China.</P>
      <P>The representatives also predicted the ECFA would be inked in the first half of
this year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Kenting music fest visitor numbers seen as being down this year</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The total number of people participating in Taiwan's popular music festival
centered in the Kenting area, which ended Monday, was down from last year, the
organizers and local hotels believe.</P>
      <P>Tens of thousands of music fans crowd into Kenting in southern Taiwan's Pingtung
County every year for the music festival that is centered around "Spring Scream,
" the longest-running music event in the country.</P>
      <P>Aside from the "Spring Scream" held in Eluanbi from April 2-5, other side events
-- "Spring Wave, ""Peninsula Electronic Party" and "Spring Wave Hengchun
Electronic Party" -- were held at other venues in the Hengchun Peninsula on
April 3 and April 4.</P>
      <P>Most of the evidence of lower attendance this year seemed more anecdotal than
backed with hard numbers.</P>
      <P>Shen Kuan-yuan, general manager of Friendly Dog Entertainment which hosted the
"Spring Wave" and "Spring Wave Hengchun Electronic Party," said it had sold
about 15,000 tickets this year.</P>
      <P>He estimated that the concerts this year might only break even, unlike last year
which were profitable.</P>
      <P>Many shop owners in Kenting also said that a lot of people participating in the
music festival did not stay overnight in the town.</P>
      <P>Shen suggested that one of the factors contributing to the perceived decline was
that the number of tourists from Hong Kong and Macau increased this year,
prompting many Taiwanese music fans who were unable to book local guesthouses to
not make the trip.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, 20,000 tickets to the actual "Spring Scream" event were sold
this year, more than last year, according to Wade Davis and Jimi Moe, the two
American expatriates who co-founded the festival 15 years ago.</P>
      <P>While last year's "Spring Scream" broke even, it would make money this year,
they said, adding that more than 2,000 fans participated the last one-stage
concert Monday.</P>
      <P>The "Spring Scream", which began with two stages for performances by 30 bands in
1995, has grown into a six-stage show hosting 200 local and foreign bands this
year.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Kaohsiung City's Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) Bureau plans to issue a travel card at
the end of this month to offer a range of preferential services, with the aim of
boosting MRT passenger volume, Chen Kai-ling, director-general of the bureau,
said Monday.</P>
      <P>The city government will use its air pollution control fund to finance the card,
which will be valid for payment of travel by air, high speed rail, conventional
train, Kaohsiung MRT, bus and ferry, according to Chen.</P>
      <P>If cardholders make good use of the various special offers that will come with
the card, they would be able to get discounts of up to 40 percent on Kaohsiung
MRT fares, compared to the 15 percent discount offered to I-Pass holders.</P>
      <P>The MRT bureau will target mainly corporate commuters, Chen said, adding that
employees who apply for the card through their companies will get the best
discounts for travel on the Kaohisung MRT.</P>
      <P>In addition, for each NT$200 put on the stored value card by consumers, the city
will add NT$50, Chen said.</P>
      <P>The MRT bureau has signed contracts with six companies to pave the way of the
issuing of the card, he said.</P>
      <P>Since the Kaohsiung Rapid Transit Corp. (KRTC) launched the I-Pass in 2008, the
number of cards in circulation has reached 1.5 million. The I-Pass was designed
to pay fares on the city's metro, bus and ferry services.</P>
      <P>Apart from the I-Pass, the KRTC, in collaboration with some banks, has issued a
joint-brand card but it is not popular because of its limited functions.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan to crack down on mislabeled instant noodles</HEADLINE>

04/05/10  18:50:03
(By Chen Li-ting and Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) recently released drafted regulations on labeling
products in Taiwan that stipulate instant beef noodles cannot be called "beef
noodles" if they do not contain beef.</P>
      <P>Under the drafted regulations, which were proposed based on the Act Governing
Food Sanitation, the labeling of instant noodle products should reflect the
actual content of the packaging.</P>
      <P>Noodle products must include an "ingredient parcel" containing beef or shrimp if
they are to be labeled "beef noodles" or "shrimp noodles, " said Liu Fang-ming,
an official at the DOH's Food and Drug Administration.</P>
      <P>"Without the ingredients, they can only be called 'beef noodle soup' or 'shrimp-
flavored soup'," Liu said.</P>
      <P>The new regulations were drafted after consumers complained that pictures on
packages of instant noodle products did not match the food in the packages, he
added.</P>
      <P>Asked why the proposal failed to define the amount of meat required, Liu said
that it was because the administration found that different people have
different definitions on the size.</P>
      <P>However, measures will be reinforced to ensure products contain the ingredients
advertised on their packages, the official said.</P>
      <P>A preliminary notice of the proposal was made on April 1. A formal notice of the
drafted regulations, which stipulate that violators can be fined between
NT$30,000 and NT$150,000, could come as soon as May 1, according to the DOH.</P>
      <P>The new rules would take effect one year after the formal notice, the department
said.</P>

      <P>Taiwanese golfer Yani Tseng has catapulted to the top of the U.S. LPGA Tour's
official money list after capturing  the Kraft Nabisco  Championship  in Rancho
Mirage, California, on Sunday.</P>
      <P>Tseng earned US$300,000 for winning the first major tournament of the year in
women's golf, boosting her total prize money in the LPGA Tour's first four
events of the year to US$460,932.</P>
      <P>That does not include the prize money Tseng won for capturing the Australian
Women's Open earlier this year because that event is sanctioned by the Ladies
European Tour.</P>
      <P>Japanese golfer Ai Miyazato, who won the LPGA Tour's first two events of the
year in Thailand and Singapore but missed the cut this past weekend, is second
with US$398,284 and Kraft Nabisco runner-up Suzann Pettersen of Norway is third
with US$380,203.</P>
      <P>The 21-year-old Tseng shot a final round 68 Sunday for a total of 275 at Mission
Hills Country Club to hold off the Norwegian by one shot.</P>
      <P>The Taiwanese opened a four-shot lead after shooting a 32 on the front nine, but
a cautious finish of six straight pars down the stretch, when she admittedly did
not play aggressively enough nearly let Pettersen back into the tournament.</P>
      <P>It was the second major title of her career, after winning the McDonalds LPGA
Championship in 2008 as a rookie. This one, she said, had a different feel to
the win two years ago.</P>
      <P>"Last time I won a major, I didn't feel anything. I didn't feel like I could win
a tournament, " she said.</P>
      <P>"But this week I knew I had a chance to win, so I called my coach, my short game
coach, my long game coach, my psychologist to see what I should think about
today, because I was really nervous and playing ahead."</P>
      <P>She also credited one of the LPGA Tour's greatest players ever for helping her
with the mental aspect of the game.</P>
      <P>"I really want to thank Annika Sorenstam because she came to my house and we sat
down and talked about two hours. She helped me a lot on my game, about the
mental side," Tseng said.</P>
      <P>"(She said) everything outside the ropes you need to just get rid of. When you
get inside the ropes, you just want to have fun and play golf, and you don't
want to think about too much."</P>
      <P>Her latest win is expected to propel Tseng into the top five in the Rolex World
Rankings after starting last week ranked sixth, and she also moved into the top
spot in the standings for the highly coveted LPGA Player of the Year award,
ahead of Miyazato and Pettersen.</P>
      <P>Tseng also became the birdie leader on the LPGA Tour, with 64, or an average of
four per round, for the first four tournaments of the year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwanese illustrator extends his reach beyond Asia</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwanese illustrator Jimmy Liao has enjoyed unparalleled success over the past
decade in the Far East, but his recent collaborations with British and American
publishers on children's books show that his drawings speak a universal
language.</P>
      <P>The well-known author-illustrator, known popularly as simply "Jimmy," started
his career by depicting the lives of ordinary people coping in the modern urban
world, and works based on that theme became big hits in Taiwan, Shanghai, Hong
Kong, Singapore and many other Asian markets during the past 10 years.</P>
      <P>Building on that success, he is now extending his reach by illustrating
children's books written by English-language writers.</P>
      <P>His first collaboration with an American publisher -- "I Can be Anything" -- was
published last month, said his agent Lee Yusan.</P>
      <P>He hopes it will earn him the same acclaim as his first project with the West,
"The Monster Who Ate Darkness," published last year by U.K.-based publisher
Walker Books for children above three years old.</P>
      <P>Written by English author Joyce Dunbar, the book tells the story of a tiny
monster that lives under a child's bed and discovers it likes to eat darkness.</P>
      <P>"The book has now been translated into Chinese, and is doing very well in the
Chinese market, which has been a surprise to the English publisher, " said Lee,
who attributed the success to Jimmy's many fans there.</P>
      <P>In a previous press conference, the shy illustrator admitted that drawing for
children has always been his dream, and his output reflects his passion.</P>
      <P>His abundant creativity came through in "I Can Be Anything, " an imaginative
joyride about hopes and dreams that was written by Newbery-Award winning
American author Jerry Spinelli and published by Little, Brown and Company.</P>
      <P>And there's more to come.</P>
      <P>"Readers will not need to wait too long to see the Jimmy's third work, which has
been completed and sent to Walker Books, " revealed Lee, who has been
responsible for promoting Jimmy's art and related products to other parts of
Asia.</P>
      <P>In addition to pitching his books, Lee is also organizing a "Jimmy art center"
in Taipei that will incorporate the illustrator's art and ideas in the center's
design and decor.</P>
      <P>"I hope the center can open in the first half of the year, " Lee said.</P>
      <P>Jimmy's success has been largely driven by his own creativity, hard work, and
Lee's help. But a major blow he suffered 15 years ago, when he was diagnosed
with leukemia, marked a turning point in his life -- and work -- that only added
to his drawings' appeal.</P>
      <P>His depictions of people became proportionally smaller, a kind of recognition
that they could not change the big world, but they face life and the world with
grace and a positive attitude.</P>
      <P>That may be the main reason why his works move and resonate with readers and
provide them with comfort, one reviewer suggested.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou will meet privately with former Japanese Prime Minister
Taro Aso, who arrived Monday in Taiwan on a four-day private visit, political
sources said.</P>
      <P>Aso, accompanied by his wife, daughter and personal aides, is making his first
trip to Taiwan since he stepped down as premier last September  after his
Liberal  Democratic  Party (LDP)  lost a parliamentary election a month earlier
to the Democratic Party of Japan.</P>
      <P>Although the LDP is no longer in power, sources said Aso still holds enormous
sway in the Japanese political arena. His visit to Taiwan has drawn considerable
attention because many believe he can help bridge Taipei-Tokyo relations.</P>
      <P>Given his sensitive status as a retired prime minister and the absence of
diplomatic ties between Taiwan and Japan, Aso kept a low profile after arriving
Monday.</P>
      <P>He did not respond to press inquiries about his itinerary in Taiwan and did not
make any public comments. He was seen chatting animatedly with John Feng,
Taiwan's representative to Japan, who returned to Taipei earlier in the day to
welcome Aso at Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport.</P>
      <P>Neither the Presidential Office nor the Ministry of Foreign Affairs would
confirm that Ma will meet Aso during the latter's visit.</P>
      <P>Sources have said, however, that Aso will not only meet with Ma but also with
other Taiwanese political heavyweights, including Legislative Speaker Wang Jin-
pyng.</P>
      <P>Wang, who has maintained close ties with the Japanese political community, will
invite Aso to dinner Wednesday, and ruling Kuomintang legislators with Japanese
educational backgrounds will also be present.</P>
      <P>Aso is visiting Taiwan at the invitation of Chinatrust Group Chairman Jeffrey
Koo.</P>
      <P>Aso, who served as Japan's prime minister from September 2008 through September
2009, last visited Taiwan in April 2003 in his capacity as head of the then-
ruling LDP's policy coordination council.</P>
      <P>During that visit, he attended a seminar with politicians from Taiwan's
Democratic Progressive Party, which held power at the time.</P>
      <P>Only two other retired Japanese prime ministers have visited Taiwan. Takeo
Fukuda visited Taiwan in March 1992 and Yoshiro Mori visited Taiwan in December
2003 and again in November 2006.</P>

      <P>The Tourism Bureau under the Ministry of Transportation and Communications
(MOTC) launched a new sightseeing tour bus service Monday enabling tourists to
cheaply and easily travel to famous scenic spots around Taiwan, bureau officials
announced Monday.</P>
      <P>The bus services run every 60 minutes during weekdays and every 30 minutes at
weekends, with the distinctive red bus stops providing bus information in both
Chinese and English, according to the bureau.</P>
      <P>Addressing the launch ceremony of the service, Minister of Transportation and
Communications Mao Chi-kuo said he hopes travel in Taiwan can become more public
transport- friendly because people can easily board these connecting buses at
Taiwan Railway Administration train stations or Taiwan High Speed Rail stations.</P>
      <P>A total of 20 bus lines are planned for 10 counties and cities, with nine of
them scheduled to begin service immediately.</P>
      <P>To promote the services, the Jiaosi and Dung Shan River lines in Yilan County
are offering free services until December, while in Tainan City, the Anping and
the Taijiang lines are providing free services until July.</P>
      <P>The other lines that began operating Monday are the Cihu Line in Taoyuan County,
the Sun Moon Lake Line in Nantou County, the Alishan Line in Chiayi County, the
City Tour Line in Chiayi City, and the Kenting Line in Pingtung County.</P>
      <P>The fare on the Kenting Line, which connects the High Speed Rail station in
Kaohsiung and ends in Kenting, is NT$407 -- the most expensive of all the new
lines.</P>
      <P>The remaining 11 lines will start operating by the end of June and will take
tourists to popular sightseeing spots such as Taroko, Green Island and Shitou.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The state-run Taiwan Power Co. (Taipower) said Monday that it was striving to
begin operation at the fourth nuclear power plant by National Day next year.</P>
      <P>Taipower confirmed media reports that Premier Wu Den-yih hopes the company can
move the schedule ahead two months -- from the end of next year to Oct. 10, the
centennial of the Wuchang Uprising that led to the downfall of China's Qing
Dynasty government and the birth of the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>Tu Yueh-yuan, chief engineer of Taipower, said that she is "cautiously
optimistic" that the company can achieve the target, adding that it will ensure
the construction of the Taipei County plant meets the highest safety standards.</P>
      <P>Over 80 percent of the construction of the power plant -- formally named the
Lungmen Nuclear Power Plant -- is complete, Tu said, adding that the project is
only a very small bit behind schedule.</P>
      <P>Tu said that the plant would have to undergo testing by the Cabinet-level
Atomic Energy Council before starting commercial operation, so that there is no
need to worry about safety.</P>
      <P>Construction of the power plant has caused strong protests from anti-nuclear
activists and residents living in the vicinity of the power plant in Gongliao,
northern Taiwan's Taipei County.</P>
      <P>During the previous Democratic Progressive Party administration, construction
was temporarily  suspended in 2000 in line with then-President Chen Shui-bian's
campaign promise to create a nuclear- free Taiwan. But the suspension was lifted
in early 2001 after the administration came under pressure from the legislature
and segments of society. A consensus was reached that the fourth nuclear plant
would be the last one.</P>

      <P>A number of companies in Taiwan have won the hearts of local customers by
relocating their customer services from China to Taiwan, a local newspaper said
Monday.</P>
      <P>"Customers have many technical problems with Canon's digital cameras and it is
easier to communicate with them through the customer service system being set up
in Taiwan, " Jesse Su, a senior general manager at Canon Taiwan, told Taiwan's
Chinese-language United Daily News.</P>
      <P>Canon  Taiwan  has seen a rise in the level of customer satisfaction since it
relocated customer service to Taiwan from Hong Kong in September last year, Su
said.</P>
      <P>This also helped the Japanese company sell more high-end cameras in Taiwan last
year, Su noted.</P>
      <P>BenQ Corp., a Taiwanese consumer electronics maker, also saw greater levels of
customer satisfaction after relocating their customer service line from China to
Taiwan, the report said.</P>
      <P>Cultural difference is a major factor that hurts customer satisfaction when a
company outsources its service calls from Taiwan to China, said Jerry Peng, the
general manager of BenQ's customer service in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Some Chinese employees, for example, did not used to know what "3G"  meant  as
China  launched  the  third-generation  mobile communications technology several
years after Taiwan, Peng said.</P>
      <P>Chinese employees were also not familiar with some of the popular Taiwanese
terms that came up during conversations and were often unable to correctly write
down Taiwanese customers' postal addresses, he added.</P>
      <P>The relocation from China to Taiwan did not increase BenQ's costs after the
company streamlined operational procedures, the report said.</P>
      <P>In a related United Daily News report, a Taiwanese consumer surnamed Chang said
that a Chinese service-call employee wrongly typed her name on the product
package delivered to her even though she had explained how to write her name
several times over the phone.</P>
      <P>"It's probably because the employee uses simplified Chinese and did not
understand what I said," she said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Military denies report about 10% pay raise for military officers</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of National Defense (MND) denied a media report Monday that each
military officer could get a 10 percent pay raise after the preferential tax
treatment given to military personnel is eliminated, as early as next year.</P>
      <P>Military members and school teachers have long been exempt from paying taxes on
their income, but the Apple Daily reported that the Executive Yuan is expected
to abolish the tax break next year.</P>
      <P>The report said that to compensate military personnel for the tax policy change,
the MND has finalized a scheme to raise the salaries of all service members,
based on the principle of raising pay by the same amount levied in income taxes.</P>
      <P>As a result, the report said, each military officer could get an estimated 10
percent or even higher pay raise.</P>
      <P>The MND said in a statement Monday, however, that the report was not factual
because the ministry has yet to finalize any salary adjustment scheme.</P>
      <P>According to an Executive Yuan policy directive passed in 2002, the MND said it
will draft a salary adjustment package in line with the principle of no
reductions in service members' income after the Legislative Yuan completes legal
amendments and sets a date for enforcement of the new taxation rules.</P>
      <P>The draft package of income tax amendments is still pending legislative
approval.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a report carried in the Monday edition of the China Times said the
government's personnel expenditure will increase by at least NT$24 billion
annually after an all-volunteer military service system takes effect in 2014.</P>
      <P>Based on that estimate, the country's more than 5 million households that file
taxes will pay an additional NT$4,000 in income tax per year to help finance the
all-volunteer system, the report said.</P>
      <P>Responding to the report, the MND said the government's personnel expenditures
will increase in a steady manner based on the military's well-devised
recruitment system.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the all-volunteer service system will help reduce training and
operational costs because service members will stay longer in the military and
thus become more adept at operating weaponary systems.</P>
      <P>Such a reduction  will help offset increases in personnel expenditure, the
ministry argued.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's first large man-made lake project is simply aimed at stabilizing the
water supply in southern Taiwan, a water resources official said Monday.</P>
      <P>Joses Y. H. Wu, deputy director of the Water Resources Agency (WRA) under the
Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA), made the remark to rebut claims by some
environmental groups that the Jiyang Lake project is aimed at benefiting gravel
industry operators.</P>
      <P>When a project to dig five man-made lakes in an area straddling Kaohsiung and
Pingtung counties was proposed five years ago, Wu said, the 72 million cubic
meters of gravel expected to be extracted were considered an important resource
for southern Taiwan, because the region faced a shortage of gravel for the
construction industry.</P>
      <P>However, Wu said, the picture has changed greatly after Typhoon Morakot wreaked
havoc in southern Taiwan last August. Since then, more than 15 million cubic
meters of gravel have been dredged from the Cishan and Laonong rivers, which
flow into the Gaoping River, to date.</P>
      <P>As a result, southern Taiwan has stopped importing gravel from China and will
likely not have to do so over the next three to five years.</P>
      <P>Out of environmental concerns, however, the MOEA has decided to cut the number
of man-made lakes to be dug in the region from five to only two, Wu said.</P>
      <P>Noting that the Jiyang man-made lake project has been approved by the MOEA, the
Council for Economic Planning and Development and the Environmental Protection
Administration, Wu said the project is simply aimed at helping stabilize the
water supply in southern Taiwan, which has often been troubled by water
shortages.</P>
      <P>The proposed lakes will be able to conserve river water during the rainy season
and restrain land subsidence by reducing the extraction of groundwater. During
the dry season, it will serve as a supplementary source of water, Wu said.</P>
      <P>According to the WRA's plan, the project will get under way in 2011, with a
budget of NT$17 billion. The new lakes will be able to store 20 million cubic
meters of water.</P>

      <P>As Vice Premier Eric Liluan Chu is the only one who has voiced his intention to
run in the Xinbei municipal election,  the Kuomintang (KMT) will directly tap
him as its nominee in the race, but it will have to hold public opinion polls to
decide its candidates in four other municipal elections.</P>
      <P>Su Jun-pin, director of the KMT's Department of Culture and Information, said
that the party will publish a list of aspirants on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>"The party will hold public opinion polls by mid-April as scheduled and start
the coordination process," Su said.</P>
      <P>According to the lists supplied by local KMT chapters, there are six aspirants
for Kaohsiung:  Legislators Huang Chao-shun,  Ho Tsai-feng, Chang Hsien-yao and
Lin Yi-shih; Lai Feng-wei, deputy secretary-general of the Presidential Office;
and Su Ying-kuei, former director of Taipei City's Labor Affairs Department.</P>
      <P>There are three aspirants in Tainan -- former Legislators Lee Chuan-chiao and
Kuo Tian-tsai and Tainan City Councilor Hsieh Lung-chieh.</P>
      <P>There are two hopefuls in Taipei City -- incumbent Mayor Hau Lung-bin and Taipei
City Councilor Yang Shih-chiu. In Taichung, the two hopefuls are sitting Mayor
Jason Hu and KMT Legislator Chi Kuo-tung.</P>
      <P>The KMT recently passed regulations regarding the nominations of candidates for
the year-end five municipalities -- crucial because they are considered the
forerunner of the 2012 presidential election.</P>
      <P>According to the regulations, if more than one candidate wishes to run, the
party will encourage them to negotiate. If necessary, there will be no party
member voting, but the results of public opinion polls will be used as a major
reference in nomination.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan's benefits should be priority in ECFA talks: official</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 5 (CNA)
04/05/10  23:41:50

    <TEXT>
      <P>A government official said Monday that the most important aspect of signing a
proposed cross-strait economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) is not
whether to hold talks with China, but to ensure the negotiations were conducted
with Taiwan's best interests in mind.</P>
      <P>Bureau of Foreign Trade Director-General Huang Chih-peng said in a televised
debate that last week's second round of talks proved Taiwan was upholding its
basic principles during negotiations.</P>
      <P>Huang said that Taiwan's major trade partners will only talk with Taiwan on free
trade agreements (FTAs)  after Taiwan resolves political issues with China and
that there is a "very high" possibility these partners would ink FTAs with
Taiwan if the cross-strait ECFA is signed.</P>
      <P>Huang made the arguments while teaming up with Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator Lai
Shyh-bao against two former Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) legislators --
Chuang Suo-hang and Julian Kuo -- in the debate broadcast by CtiTV as a prelude
to a planned debate between President Ma Ying-jeou and DPP Chairperson Tsai Ing-
wen.</P>
      <P>When audience  members asked whether  Taiwan should accept concessions from
China, Huang said that Taiwan's negotiators will seek to maximize benefits and
minimize any potential negative impact on local industries at the negotiation
table.</P>
      <P>The objective of signing the all-encompassing ECFA is to help local business
expand into the Chinese market, he added.</P>
      <P>If Taiwan and China want to exchange early harvest lists to allow goods that
each side will open for immediate tariff concessions, they have to sign the ECFA
under World Trade Organization rules, which allows bilateral arrangements under
comprehensive trade agreements, Huang said.</P>
      <P>Otherwise, if the two countries signed industry-specific deals rather than a
broader trade deal, they would be obligated to offer the same preferential
treatment to all WTO members based on the "most-favored nation" principle.</P>
      <P>Lai also said that he believes the accord would benefit both the country and the
ordinary people, adding that the ECFA may "not be a panacea, but a pain-killer,
a booster shot."</P>
      <P>Kuo said that the DPP is not opposed to signing trade agreements with China, but
favored conducting single-issue negotiations.</P>
      <P>If Taiwan only signs an ECFA with China, Kuo said, it would be marginalized and
overly reliant on China because China has inked FTAs with many countries in the
world, but Taiwan has failed to do so.</P>
      <P>He suggested that Taiwan sign the trade pact with China and FTAs with many other
countries at the same time by taking the same approach as when Taiwan joined the
WTO in 2002.</P>
      <P>Kuo also questioned whether the government underestimated the negative impact
that allowing China's services sector to operate in Taiwan could cause the local
retail industry.</P>
      <P>The most important issues facing the country now are high unemployment and
sluggish investment that cannot be resolved by signing the trade pact with
China, Kuo contended.</P>
      <P>Representatives from the local textile industry expressed their support for the
proposed ECFA, saying that Taiwan would have the chance to join the ASEAN Plus
Three economic bloc after signing the trade accord with China.</P>
      <P>The representatives also predicted the ECFA would be inked in the first half of
this year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Kenting music fest visitor numbers seen as being down this year</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The total number of people participating in Taiwan's popular music festival
centered in the Kenting area, which ended Monday, was down from last year, the
organizers and local hotels believe.</P>
      <P>Tens of thousands of music fans crowd into Kenting in southern Taiwan's Pingtung
County every year for the music festival that is centered around "Spring Scream,
" the longest-running music event in the country.</P>
      <P>Aside from the "Spring Scream" held in Eluanbi from April 2-5, other side events
-- "Spring Wave, ""Peninsula Electronic Party" and "Spring Wave Hengchun
Electronic Party" -- were held at other venues in the Hengchun Peninsula on
April 3 and April 4.</P>
      <P>Most of the evidence of lower attendance this year seemed more anecdotal than
backed with hard numbers.</P>
      <P>Shen Kuan-yuan, general manager of Friendly Dog Entertainment which hosted the
"Spring Wave" and "Spring Wave Hengchun Electronic Party," said it had sold
about 15,000 tickets this year.</P>
      <P>He estimated that the concerts this year might only break even, unlike last year
which were profitable.</P>
      <P>Many shop owners in Kenting also said that a lot of people participating in the
music festival did not stay overnight in the town.</P>
      <P>Shen suggested that one of the factors contributing to the perceived decline was
that the number of tourists from Hong Kong and Macau increased this year,
prompting many Taiwanese music fans who were unable to book local guesthouses to
not make the trip.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, 20,000 tickets to the actual "Spring Scream" event were sold
this year, more than last year, according to Wade Davis and Jimi Moe, the two
American expatriates who co-founded the festival 15 years ago.</P>
      <P>While last year's "Spring Scream" broke even, it would make money this year,
they said, adding that more than 2,000 fans participated the last one-stage
concert Monday.</P>
      <P>The "Spring Scream", which began with two stages for performances by 30 bands in
1995, has grown into a six-stage show hosting 200 local and foreign bands this
year.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Tuesday that Taiwan must improve its relations with
China to turn what has been a liability into an asset.</P>
      <P>In seeking to establish its international status, Taiwan must not allow cross-
Taiwan Strait ties to become its burden, Ma said during a question-and-answer
session in a video conference linking Taipei with Harvard University faculty and
students.</P>
      <P>He acknowledged that some people in Taiwan may disagree with his China policy
but said that his administration will stick to the "right policy" that will not
only be beneficial to Taiwan but also to the East Asian region and the rest of
the world.</P>
      <P>The purpose of his upcoming debate with opposition Democratic Progressive  Party
Chairwoman  Tsai  Ing-wen  on the proposed Taiwan-China economic cooperation
framework agreement (ECFA) is to try to build consensus within the nation on the
issue, he explained.</P>
      <P>Stressing that Taiwan must not be left behind as Asia grows more economically
integrated, Ma said signing the ECFA with China will be a major step for Taiwan,
enabling it to link more closely with countries in the region and the rest of
the world.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan is already 10 years late in taking this step, it is now on the
right track, Ma said.</P>
      <P>The video conference linked Ma with Harvard's Fairbank Center for Chinese
Studies.</P>
      <P>Before taking questions from his audience, Ma delivered a 20-minute address
titled "The Quest for Modernity."</P>
      <P>Issues covered in the speech included Taiwan's experience in sailing through the
economic recession, the country's policy to pursue cross-Taiwan Strait peace and
flexible diplomacy, and its values of democracy and freedom.</P>

    <HEADLINE>China Times: Water rights issue needs to be tackled quickly</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>04/06/10  11:54:24
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The central government and the Yunlin County government have blamed each other
for the land subsidence problem that could imperil the safety of the section of
the elevated high-speed rail line that passes through the county. It's an
indication that the country's water rights issue needs to be tackled
immediately.</P>
      <P>The subsidence,  caused mainly by the heavy extraction of groundwater in the
agricultural region, has reached 55 centimeters in seven years in one section of
the high-speed rail line, nearing the upper limit of the railway system's design
tolerance.</P>
      <P>The Water Resources Agency (WRA) issued a directive recently to seal off 1,115
wells near the problem area, of which up to 1,100 were dug illegally, to curb
the subsidence problem, but the request was rejected by the opposition-
controlled Yunlin County government, which complained it would hurt farmers'
interests.</P>
      <P>According  to the country's law governing  irrigation  and engineering, water is
a natural resource belong to the entire country. The nation's sovereignty over
the water supersedes the rights of people who own the land where the water
originates. The law also stipulates that local governments are responsible for
governing the use of the water locally and handling related irregularities.</P>
      <P>We wonder why the Yunlin County government has sat idly by and done nothing
about the illegal wells. We believe its nonchalant attitude was the result of
neglect by relevant agencies of the central government and the Control Yuan,
which has the right to censure irregularities.</P>
      <P>The land subsidence problem actually has existed in Taiwan for over three
decades and has affected about one-tenth of Taiwan's land, from Changhua,
Yunlin, Chiayi, Tainan and Kaohsiung counties on the west coast to the
northeastern county of Yilan.</P>
      <P>At issue is that while there are laws governing water rights, the local
governments have been unable to implement them because they did not have the
personnel to execute the mandates.</P>
      <P>Why were the local governments able to defy the law and not allocate funding for
personnel in this area? How could the central government, which holds most of
the resources, ignore "execution"?</P>
      <P>It is interesting that the bullet train's operator, Taiwan High Speed Rail
Corporation, has insisted that even with the subsidence problem, the rail line
is safe.</P>
      <P>But the issue shows that the entire country has been sinking. Land subsidence
will not cure itself if remedial measures are not taken immediately. (April 6,

    <HEADLINE>Talk of the day---Consensus on speeding up criminal trials</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>04/06/10  12:37:37
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The endless  trials of criminal  cases have caused public discontent with the
judiciary.</P>
      <P>A bill crafted to speed up the trial of criminal cases has been debated by
lawmakers for a while, and a consensus has now apparently been reached between
legislators from the ruling and opposition parties, according to Tuesday's China
Times.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts of the China Times report: China Times:</P>
      <P>Lawmakers of the ruling and opposition parties agreed to limit any criminal case
to eight years, which is two years short of the 10 years stipulated in the draft
bill to expedite criminal trials submitted by the Judicial Yuan.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile the detention of defendants charged with a felony should not exceed
two years and 11 months, according to the consensus.</P>
      <P>The lawmakers also agreed that prosecutors' power to appeal not-guilty verdicts
should be limited, but they disagreed on how to do this.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors'  unlimited  power to appeal gained public attention recently
after a business tycoon, United Microelectronics Corp. founder Robert Tsao,
erupted into a tirade in court during a hearing on an appeal by prosecutors. He
complained that prosecutors had repeatedly appealed the not-guilty verdict
handed down in his original trial.</P>
      <P>According to the consensus of the lawmakers, criminal cases that have been tried
for more than eight years should be closed, with the latest verdict, if it is
not guilty, prevailing. If the latest verdict found the defendant guilty, the
defendant could appeal to the court for commutation.</P>
      <P>Defendants detained because they are charged with a felony are limited to those
offenses which carry a punishment of the death penalty, life imprisonment or
imprisonment of more than 10 years.</P>
      <P>The detention of the defendants for the above reasons should not exceed 15
months during each of the first and second trials, and five months for the third
trial, while the total detention during all trials should not exceed 35 months.</P>
      <P>A law enforcement official said the bill, once enacted, will provide better
protection for the victims, plaintiffs and defendants in criminal cases.</P>
      <P>Defendants won't be tried or detained for more than eight years, according to
the bill, in contrast to existing law, which would allow the defendants to be
held in custody indefinitely, according to the official.</P>
      <P>Hsieh Wen-ting, secretary-general of the Judicial Yuan, said the bill will
improve the efficiency of the court and force judges to render verdicts more
carefully.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile an official of the Ministry of Justice said that the ministry has
asked prosecutors to think carefully before appealing not-guilty verdicts.

    <HEADLINE>Removing Chinese missiles prerequisite for peace accord: president</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 6 (CNA)
04/06/10  14:15:58
(By Garfie Li and Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou renewed Tuesday his call for China "to remove or actually
dismantle" its missiles targeting Taiwan as a prerequisite for talks on a cross-
Taiwan Strait peace accord.</P>
      <P>Ma also reaffirmed his policy of maintaining the status quo across the strait,
saying the conditions are not yet ripe for unification.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks in response to questions on cross-strait relations, during a
video conference linking Taipei with Harvard University faculty and students.</P>
      <P>According to Ma, Taiwan is well aware of China's ambition to annex Taiwan, but
it has to face up to the reality, try to temper cross-strait tensions and
prevent China from using force against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"We also demand that the mainland should remove or actually dismantle  all the
missiles that are targeted against Taiwan. Otherwise we won't be interested in
making further step to negotiate a peace agreement with them," the president
said.</P>
      <P>In pursuing cross-strait peace, Taiwan also puts a priority on maintaining its
military power so that it will serve as a deterrent and protect Taiwan's
security, Ma said.</P>
      <P>He said Taiwan will insist that the two sides seek a peaceful resolution of
their differences and strengthen their economic and cultural exchanges to lower
the risk of military conflict.</P>
      <P>"I have always considered mainland China both a risk and an opportunity. My
policy is to maximize the opportunity, but minimize the risk. And this is
exactly what I have been doing," he said.</P>
      <P>Ma said the past 60 years have provided a rare opportunity for the two sides to
engage in a political, economic and social experiment, resulting in "a very
clear contrast" in terms of their respective development.</P>
      <P>"We understand the time for unification at this stage is not ripe yet. The
majority, the mainstream opinion in Taiwan, believes the status quo should be
maintained," Ma said.</P>
      <P>In his speech titled "The Quest for Modernity, " Ma said a society that is truly
modernizing should not be limited to wealth and power but must also include the
foundations  for freedom and democracy.</P>
      <P>"So I am proud to say that the Republic of China on Taiwan has in fact achieved
all these three pillars," he said.</P>
      <P>To the ROC, Ma said, the last century was "nothing short of an exclamation mark"
because it has been 100 years of experimentation and education before a people
learned that they too have the unequivocal rights to life, liberty and the
pursuit of happiness.</P>
      <P>Ma said his administration has been working to build up Taiwan's "soft power"
and transform the Taiwan Strait from a major flash point into a conduit for
regional peace and prosperity.</P>
      <P>The policy of flexible diplomacy and the pursuit of a diplomatic truce with
China has also helped end the vicious cycle of diplomatic warfare between the
two sides, according to Ma.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Commercial Times: One Taiwan, two worlds</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>04/06/10  15:17:32
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>In Taiwan, there is a situation of "one country, two worlds." Despite the small
size of the country, there are two different worlds that exist because of the
wealth gap and the gap between urban and rural areas. This is a pressing issue
that politicians need to acknowledge and address.</P>
      <P>According to a news report, some rich people spend over NT$10,000 (US$314) for
one hair treatment -- a sum that is equivalent to 40 percent of the NT$25,000
per month that the average new university graduate receives on his or her first
job.</P>
      <P>Statistics for 2000 showed that the total assets of the richest 20 percent of
people in the country was 5.55 times more than that held by the poorest 20
percent. But by the end of 2008, that gap had widened to 6.05 times.</P>
      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) , which was in power from
2000-2008, must be blamed for doing nothing to address the wealth gap during
that period. Nonetheless, the Kuomintang cannot remain nonchalant about the
issue either, because it is now running the country.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the urbanization gap probably has nothing to do with people's
happiness, but it could reflect the lifestyle differences in urbanized and rural
areas.</P>
      <P>Differing lifestyles could lead to differences in core values and political
identification. Generally speaking,  people in highly urbanized areas tend to
more readily accept globalized views and policies. In comparison, people in
rural areas are usually more concerned about matters pertaining to their
immediate environment and circumstances.</P>
      <P>When there are such widely differing views and concerns among the people, they
tend to have a hard time communicating with and understanding each other.  This
is a situation that could be manipulated by politicians to create more divisive
issues, which would eventually destabilize Taiwan.</P>
      <P>We hope the ruling and opposition parties will take to heart Confucius'
teachings that "there will be no poverty if the country's wealth is equally
distributed; a nation's small size is no problem so long as the people remain
kind and peaceful to each other; and a nation would have no worries of collapse
if its society is stable." The parties should pay heed and introduce more
constructive policies and measures.</P>
      <P>We urge those politicians who claim they "do love Taiwan" to devise concrete
measures to help erase the "one Taiwan, two worlds" phenomenon. (April 6, 2010)</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>China reportedly produced a long "early harvest" list during the most recent
round of cross-strait economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) talks that
would require Taiwan to open its doors to over 700 categories of products and
services from China. President Ma Ying-jeou's administration has so far not said
anything about it.</P>
      <P>About 60 percent of Taiwan's workforce are in the service sector. If China's
demands are met and Chinese workers are allowed to work in Taiwan's service
sector, it would mean that some 3.21 million white-collar workers in 15 business
lines would be affected.</P>
      <P>What are the Ma administration's principles with regard to what will be opened
and what will remain closed to Chinese products and services? The administration
should be keeping the people fully abreast of its China policy and the content
and purpose of Taiwan's imminent signing of the ECFA with China.</P>
      <P>How long will the Ma administration duck its responsibility to let the people
know?</P>
      <P>Ma and his ECFA negotiators have repeated that Taiwan will not under any
circumstances open its doors wider to agricultural products from China even if
the ECFA is signed.</P>
      <P>They have blurred the points. The agricultural products are not the point. The
point is how much the idiotic Ma administration will lead Taiwan's industrial
service sector to compromise simply for the signing of the ECFA.</P>
      <P>Before long, not only will members of the domestic agricultural and industrial
sectors vent their anger, the white-collar workers will probably also rise up to
defend their rights and interests.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Former first lady Wu Shu-jen has agreed to transfer roughly NT$700 million held
overseas to a bank account designated by prosecutors to obtain the early release
of former President Chen Shui-bian, Chen's office said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Office secretary Chiang Chih-ming said that after the former president was
indicted on corruption and embezzlement charges in December 2008, Chen's son and
daughter-in-law wanted to send money related to the case that they held in a
Swiss bank account back to an account designated by prosecutors in exchange for
a plea bargain.</P>
      <P>But no progress has been made in the matter, Chiang said, because Wu has
insisted that the sums in the overseas account be remitted to a third party
account for the purpose of helping the underprivileged, nurture native forces
and for public welfare.</P>
      <P>That changed, however, after Teng Chen-chiu, presiding judge at the Taiwan High
Court, gave an ultimatum on April 2 to return the money soon. Teng said Chen
would have a good chance of being released on bail if the money were returned
and little chance if it was not.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan High Court also announced on the same day that it will announce its
verdict of the corruption case surrounding Chen and his family on June 11.</P>
      <P>Wu decided to comply with the court's request after studying the matter with her
son and lawyers and signed the necessary documents.</P>
      <P>"Now it will be up to the SID to step up efforts to coordinate the matter with
Swiss judicial authorities, " Chiang said, referring to the Special
Investigation Division (SID) under the Supreme Prosecutors Office responsible
for the former president's case.</P>
      <P>Chiang said Chen's lawyers hope that Taiwanese and Swiss judicial authorities
will make rapid progress in dealing with the issue.</P>
      <P>There is no guarantee, however, that Switzerland will agree to the transfer of
the funds, which have reportedly been frozen since 2008.</P>
      <P>Chiang made the remarks after he visited Chen, who has been in detention since
late 2008, at a detention center in Taipei County.</P>
      <P>The former family's deposits of millions of U.S. dollars overseas first came to
light in August 2008, but the Chen family contended at the time that the money
was legally obtained through political donations.</P>
      <P>The SID indicted Chen, his wife, his son, daughter-in-law and 10 others in
December 2008. Both Chen and his wife were found guilty of corruption,
embezzlement and money laundering in September 2009 and sentenced to life
imprisonment by the Taipei District Court.</P>
      <P>The former first family appealed the verdict, and the Taiwan High Court has
heard the appeal for nearly six months and is expected to hand down a ruling on
June 11.</P>

      <P>The ruling Kuomintang (KMT) kicked off its process Tuesday for picking
candidates to run for the mayoral posts in Taiwan's five special municipalities
in elections scheduled to take place at the end of this year.</P>
      <P>In selecting its candidates for the elections, the party is adopting a
"coordination and recruitment" mechanism with the results of public opinion
polls serving as an important reference.</P>
      <P>The five municipality elections in Taipei City and four others to be created by
upgrading Taipei County to Xinbei City, and merging the cities and counties of
Taichung, the cities and counties of Tainan and the cities and counties of
Kaohsiung, are regarded as a bellwether for the 2012 presidential election.</P>
      <P>A KMT task force in charge of election affairs published that same day the name
list of its members who have made known their intentions to vie for the party
nominations.</P>
      <P>The list includes incumbent Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin and Taipei City Councilor
Yang Shih-chiu (for Taipei mayor) ; incumbent Taichung Mayor Jason Hu and
legislators Liu Chuan-chung and Chi Kuo-tung (for Taichung mayor) ; former
lawmakers Lee Chuan-chiao and Kuo Tien-Tsai and incumbent Tainan City Councilor
Hsieh Lung-chieh (for Tainan mayor) ; and legislators Huang Chao-shun, Ho Tsai-
feng, Lin Yi-shih and Chang Hsien-yao, former lawmaker Su Ying-kui and incumbent
Presidential Vice Secretary-General Lai Feng-wei (for Kaohsiung mayor).</P>
      <P>Of particular note is that incumbent Vice Premier Eric Lilun Chu is the only
party member seeking to run for Xinbei mayor.</P>
      <P>KMT spokesman Su Jun-pin said the party is likely to directly nominate Chu as
candidate for Xinbei, as he is unchallenged.</P>
      <P>As for the other municipalities, a coordination process among the aspirants will
have to take place before party candidates can be produced based on the results

      <P>First lady Chow Mei-ching said Tuesday that museums can be used for learning and
suggested that schools should conduct some of their classes in museums.</P>
      <P>According to Chow, most students in Taiwan go to museums to "watch" history and
many even go just for the purpose of collecting entrance stamps to satisfy their
schools' requirements.</P>
      <P>Museums or artistic exhibition organizers, meanwhile, focus their attention on
attendance, while few teachers bother to integrate museum learning sessions into
their curricula, she said.</P>
      <P>In a blog article in the magazine Education, Parenting, Family and Lifestyle
published Tuesday, Chow noted that she accompanied the Cloud Gate Dance Theater
on a North American tour at the invitation of the ensemble's founder Lin Hwai-
min between late January and early February this year.</P>
      <P>During that period, Chow said, she got the chance to visit several museums in
the United States and Canada and found that the "classes moving into the museum"
initiative has allowed numerous students and teachers there to use museums,
considered "repositories of knowledge, " not only for learning but also for
inspiring creativity and enjoyment.</P>
      <P>"The students not only `watch' the artifacts displayed, but also `read' them and

      <P>Taiwanese students took part recently in the National Model United Nations
(NMUN) conference in New York for the fourth consecutive year, gaining a
valuable opportunity to build diplomatic skills, the Taipei Economic and
Cultural Office (TECO) in New York said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The experience of representing Taiwan in UMUN is a rare one for Taiwanese
students, as Taiwan has had very few chances to participate in any U.N. events
since it lost its U.N. seat in 1971, said Kao Jen-chuan, director of TECO-New
York.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan delegation to this year's NMUN conference, which was held March
28-April 1, comprised 12 students from National Chengchi University's Department
of Diplomacy and two others from the ROC Military Academy, according to a
statement released by the office.</P>
      <P>After the conference, the students on Monday attended a reception held in their
honor by TECO-New York.</P>
      <P>NMUN-NY, which brings together more than 4,000 delegates from around the world
each year, is the world's largest college-level model United Nations. The
conference is usually sponsored by the National  Collegiate  Conference
Association,  a  recognized non-governmental organization associated with the
U.N. Department of Public Information.</P>
      <P>Taiwan had been pushing unsuccessfully  for membership  or participation in the
U.N. between 1993 and 2008.</P>
      <P>However, after President Ma Ying-jeou took office in 2008, Taiwan shifted to a
pragmatic and non-provocative approach aimed at seeking meaningful participation
in specialized U.N. agencies such as the World Health Assembly (WHA), the United
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the International
Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), Kao noted.</P>
      <P>Last year, for the first time in 16 years, Taiwan did not make a formal bid for
U.N. representation and instead asked its diplomatic allies to voice support for
its participation in specialized U.N. agencies.</P>
      <P>This approach, which is in line with Ma's flexible diplomacy policy, has gained
the approval of the international community and contributed positively to the
development of cross-Taiwan Strait relations, Kao said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou, who has been troubled by low popularity ratings, said he
believes he can bolster his level of support by pushing through reforms.</P>
      <P>During the question-and-answer portion of his video conference with faculty and
students at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Ma was quizzed about
his dipping popularity and said he took it seriously.</P>
      <P>The president said his administration had made considerable efforts in economic,
diplomatic and social welfare arenas, but he suggested  his approval ratings may
have suffered because the initiatives could have adversely affected some
people's interests.</P>
      <P>As the head of state, however, he has had to concentrate all of his energy on
the job, regardless of how he is faring in opinion polls or whether he will be
re-elected or not, the president added.</P>
      <P>Ma's popularity has declined from about 60 percent when he took office in May
2008 to about 27 percent in March 2010.</P>
      <P>Contending that people chose him as president because they hoped for change and
reform, Ma said he believes his popularity will rebound if he meets people's
expectations by reviving the economy, carrying out reforms and exhibiting strong
leadership.</P>
      <P>In response to another question about the controversy in Taiwan over whether to
scrap the death penalty, the president said his administration will sort through
differences between the opponents and proponents of capital punishment through
public discussion.</P>
      <P>"What the government should do is to provide the opportunity, the platform for
rational discussion and debate and try to find out the solution," Ma said.</P>
      <P>Ma, who served as justice minister between 1993 and 1996, said he was the first
minister of justice to stay the executions of death row inmates and the first
who ever sounded out public opinion on the issue by conducting an opinion poll.</P>
      <P>Though the poll showed that 72 percent of respondents were opposed to abolishing
the death penalty, the country has worked since then to reduce the use of
capital punishment in practice.</P>
      <P>"We have been able to change compulsory death penalty to not so compulsory. It's
optional. In other words, for some crimes, either death penalty of life
imprisonment," Ma said.</P>
      <P>He also indicated Taiwan is considering changing the procedures for arriving at
a death sentence.</P>
      <P>"For instance, we need a unanimous consent? Or we need to have oral debate in
the last instance...? Usually there is no debate, " Ma said.</P>
      <P>In order to prevent dangerous inmates from harming society after being released
from jail, Ma said the country has extended the time convicts sentenced to life
imprisonment must serve before being eligible for parole from 20 years to 25
years.</P>
      <P>Before capital punishment is abolished, however, the government must still
fulfill its duty to carry out the court's sentence, the president said.</P>
      <P>Ma's administration was embroiled in controversy in early March after then-
Minister of Justice Wang Ching-feng triggered a public outcry by refusing to
sign off on the execution of death row inmates.</P>
      <P>The president did not support her publicly, declaring that officials should do
their jobs as required by the law, and Wang then stepped down based on her
conviction that capital punishment should be abolished.</P>
      <P>Noting that it took other states decades to get rid of the death penalty, the
president said accomplishing that in Taiwan could not be done overnight,
especially in an oriental society where people believe criminals should be made
to pay for their offenses.</P>
      <P>At the conclusion of the teleconference, the Harvard-educated president sought
international support for his country's bid to enhance its international profile
and its efforts to reconcile with China.</P>
      <P>Ma said that detente between Taiwan and China is good for the international
community and that Taiwan wants to be a dignified member of the international
community and wants to contribute to it.</P>
      <P>Ma has tried to ease ties with China, which considers his country a renegade
province waiting to be reunified, by force if necessary.</P>
      <P>The 90-minute video conference, began at 7: 30 p.m EST Monday (23:30 GMT,
Monday). It attracted a good crowd at the Fairbank Center for Chinese Studies at
Harvard University.</P>
      <P>Before William C. Kirby, a history professor at Harvard, gave an introduction to
the teleconference, a pre-taped welcoming address by Harvard President Drew
Faust was played.</P>
      <P>Ma took 16 questions from the audience after giving a briefing on his policies

      <P>Taiwan will not allow Chinese white-collar workers to work in Taiwan, even after
signing a proposed economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) with China,
the Bureau of Foreign Trade under the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The Liberty Times newspaper carried a report that day saying that the government
is "opening a back door" by revising regulations to allow Chinese white-collar
workers to work to Taiwan, and said the ECFA will deal a blow to 3.21 million
Taiwanese white-collar workers.</P>
      <P>However, Huang Chih-peng, director-general of the Bureau of Foreign Trade,
rebutted the newspaper report at a press conference, saying that Taiwan will
never allow Chinese workers or professionals -- including lawyers, accountants,
engineers and doctors -- to work in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Huang said that although some Chinese company leaders, senior managers or
experts in over 20 service industries will still be allowed to work in Taiwan,
the number of categories in the group will not be large.</P>
      <P>Among those service sector businesses, only Chinese companies with an investment
or operation capital of over US$200,000 in their Taiwan branch or subsidiary can
apply for two people to work in Taiwan, and every increase of US$500,000 in
investment allows them to apply for one more person, with the maximum number
allowed for one company set at seven, Huang explained, citing regulations
revised in January.</P>
      <P>Allowing those people to work here will provide added value, as they might
create more investment and production value, as well as job opportunities for
Taiwanese people, said Huang, who was also Taiwan's chief negotiator in the
second round of cross-Taiwan Strait ECFA negotiations that ended the previous
week.</P>
      <P>In a separate news release, the bureau pointed out that most foreign companies
operating in Taiwan assign few senior managers to work here and that most of
their workers are employed locally.</P>
      <P>The Liberty Times cited the regulations published earlier by the Ministry of
Interior that stipulate that Chinese people working in multinational companies
in Taiwan will be allowed to extend their stays in Taiwan from one year to three
years.</P>
      <P>In addition, any Chinese company operating in Taiwan with revenue of NT$10
million or more, or a newly established Chinese company's Taiwan branch with
operating capital of NT$5 million or more, will become eligible to invite up to
400 Chinese people a year to Taiwan for business purposes if the company's
annual revenues reach NT$100 million, the newspaper reported.</P>
      <P>According to the opposition Democratic Progressive Party, the regulations  were
revised  to loosen restrictions  for Chinese white-collar workers working in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Huang pointed out, however, that those regulations are mostly applied to Chinese
businessmen visiting Taiwan for short term study, observation, training or trade
fairs, which does not affect Taiwan's job market.</P>

      <P>German conductor Gunther Herbig is giving a workshop in Taipei for the first
time and has attracted 16 students from five countries to attend the class, it
was revealed on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The maestro is expected to choose 10 students from among the attendees to
conduct the National Symphony Orchestra (NSO) on April 11, according to an
official of the NSO.</P>
      <P>The workshop in Taipei will be a one-week class, from April 5 to 10.</P>
      <P>"A conducting workshop is very different, its requirements are very expensive, "
Herbig indicated in a press conference Tuesday.</P>
      <P>He added that it is also very difficult to be a conductor. The arrangements are
complicated and the range of skills required is extensive, since "a conductor
has to be very musical and have a good ear, has to be able to read a score, and
also has to have the capability to bring a score to life," Herbig said.</P>
      <P>"It also needs a lot of psychological skills to deal with a group or individual
in the orchestra," he stressed.</P>
      <P>Having opened many conducting classes in Europe, Herbig said he is pleased to
have a chance to coach the students in Asia this time.</P>
      <P>The internationally well-known conductor has held the position as artistic
advisor and principal guest conductor of the NSO in Taiwan since January 2008.</P>
      <P>He used to lead many famous orchestras worldwide, and has worked as the general
music director of the Dresden Philharmonic in 1972, holding the same post with
the Berlin Symphony Orchestra from 1977 to 1983.</P>
      <P>Then he moved from East Germany to the United States in 1984 and served for 10
years as music director first of the Detroit and later of the Toronto Symphony
Orchestra.</P>
      <P>Herbig also served as the principle guest conductor of the BBC Philharmonic in
1979, and later was invited to conduct major ensembles at the London Symphony,
the Royal Philharmonic London, the Orchestre de Paris, the Israel Philharmonic
Orchestra, and many others in major cities.</P>

      <P>Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin and his Shanghai counterpart, Han Zheng, signed four
memorandums of understanding (MOUs) Tuesday to boost cooperation between the two
cities in the fields of culture, tourism, environmental conservation and science
and technology.</P>
      <P>The two mayors inked the MOUs at a Taipei-Shanghai city forum held in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Addressing the forum, Hau touted the forum as a "historic event" as it allowed
the two leading cities on each side of the Taiwan Strait to share their
development experiences and set a good example for forging closer cooperation
among other cities in Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>Hau said that Taipei City, although much smaller than Shanghai in both land area
and population, is proud of the hospitality and citizenship demonstrated by its
residents, and its success in administrative management such as waste recycling,
making it a "model city in terms of living in the global Chinese community."</P>
      <P>Hau said that both the 2010 World Expo, set to run May 1-Oct. 30 in Shanghai and
the Taipei International Flora Exposition, to be held Nov. 6 this year through
April 25, 2011, will serve as a platform for the two cities to enhance their
tourism cooperation.</P>
      <P>Han for his part touted the Shanghai Expo, saying it marks the first time that
such a world event is to be held in a developing country and that it has
attracted the participation of 242 countries and organizations.</P>
      <P>Han arrived in Taipei earlier that day for a four-day visit, the culmination of
10 years of exchanges between the two cities that began in 2001 when President
Ma Ying-jeou was mayor of Taiwan's capital.</P>
      <P>Hau Lung-bin led a delegation that visited Shanghai in June 2008.</P>
      <P>The annual forum, started in 2001 by civic groups as a channel for exchanges
between the largest cities in Taiwan and China, is being organized at an
official level for the first time this year.</P>
      <P>Han's first visit to Taiwan, however drew protests from members of the
opposition Democratic Progressive Party-led pan-green camp and democracy
activists from Hong Kong, both upon his arrival at the Taipei Songshan Airport
at the head of a 200-strong delegation and at the hotel where the forum was
held.</P>
      <P>Several DPP members who intend to run for the Taipei City Council memberships
late this year had checked into rooms at the hotel a day earlier and hung a
100-meter long banner from the fifth floor to the ground floor carrying Chinese
characters denouncing the Hau-Han meeting.</P>
      <P>Police later took down the banner and told the DPP protesters to stay in their
hotel rooms.</P>
      <P>At the same time, a woman claiming to be a member of a Hong Kong alliance for
victims of China also staged a protest at the entrance of the hotel, demanding
that Han and Hau pay more attention to the protection of human rights in China
rather than just promoting the Shanghai Expo.</P>
      <P>She was later removed by police to a nearby park, where she continued her
protest.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, according to the Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA)
-- which helped organize a "trade-matching meeting" between the business
delegates accompanying Han on the visit and Taiwan enterprises -- contracts
worth NT$1.8 billion (about US$57 million) were signed in the meeting held later
that day.</P>
      <P>Hau and Han were also scheduled to attend a concert by the Shanghai Symphony
Orchestra at the National Concert Hall.</P>
      <P>On Wednesday, Han is slated to visit the National Palace Museum, the Beitou
Incinerator and the Taipei Mass Rapid Transit system. He will also visit
Taiwan's landmark Taipei 101 building and the Eslite Xinyi flagship bookstore.</P>
      <P>He will also visit Cheng Hsin General Hospital and make trips to Taichung City,
Taipei County and Taoyuan County Thursday, before returning to Shanghai Friday.</P>

      <P>Travel agencies in Taiwan want to set up a counter at the airports to distribute
entry documents for Chinese tourists coming here, following complaints by the
air carriers that they are currently  doing most of the work in checking  and
distributing the permits.</P>
      <P>Normally, a passenger has to get an entry permit before entering Taiwan.</P>
      <P>But since Taiwan and mainland China do not have representative offices in each
other's territories to handle entry permit issues for Chinese travelers, travel
agencies in the past have had to mail entry permits back to China for the
tourists to use before boarding flights to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>To save time and avoid the travel documents getting lost in the mail, the travel
agencies have asked air carriers to help them distribute the entry permits at
the exit gates as the Chinese tourists are disembarking the plane, so they
wouldn't have to mail the entry permits back to China.</P>
      <P>If an air carrier has ascertained that a passenger has received an entry permit,
it can allow the passenger to board the plane without the permit in China and
pick up the entry permit upon the plane's landing in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The practice is known as "OK board" and is normally used under emergency
conditions.</P>
      <P>Some air carriers have tried to charge travel agencies fees for offering such a
service.</P>
      <P>Due to the quota of Chinese tourists, currently set at 7,200 daily temporarily
until the end of the month, the airlines have also complained that they have
been overloaded with this time-consuming task.</P>
      <P>Hsu Kao-ching, secretary general of the Travel Agent Association of Taiwan, said
that after coordinating with the air carriers, they have consented that no
processing fees will be charged until the end of the month.</P>
      <P>The travel agencies have also cut "OK board" practices, although it cannot be
avoided altogether, he said.</P>
      <P>To provide Chinese tourists with a more speedy service, Hsu said the association
has scouted  a place at the Taiwan  Taoyuan International Airport and proposed
allowing the tourists to pick up their entry permits there upon arrival.</P>
      <P>But Taiwan's National Immigration Agency (NIA) recently rejected the suggested
solution. It said that the passengers must have entry permits to be able to
board a plane, adding that it is the security norm of traveling.</P>
      <P>According to the law, air carriers will be fined heavily if they take on board
passengers who have no legal entry permits.</P>

      <P>Global smartphone designer HTC on Tuesday announced first quarter revenues of
NT$37.7 billion (US$1.2 billion), up 19.3 percent year-on-year and higher than
its forecast of NT$32 billion to NT$34 billion.</P>
      <P>The company reported Q1 net profit of NT$5.03 billion, with earnings per share
(EPS) of NT$6.42.</P>
      <P>However, its Q1 revenues and net profits were down 8 percent and 9.2 percent
respectively from Q4 last year.</P>
      <P>The company's revenues rose sharply to NT$16.4 billion in March, an increase of
about 60 percent from February and 32.4 percent compared to the same month last
year.</P>
      <P>According to HTC, the better-than-expected figures prove that it has adopted
successful branding strategies.</P>
      <P>As most institutional investors had expected the company's EPS for Q1 to be
around NT$5 to NT$5.5, its shares are likely to rise Wednesday, analysts said.</P>
      <P>HTC shares closed at NT$381 Tuesday, NT$6.0, or 1.6 percent higher than the
closing figure Monday.</P>
      <P>Most foreign investors are optimistic about HTC's outlook.</P>
      <P>Morgan Stanley recently raised its target price on HTC from NT$423 to NT$450.
Macquarie Securities reiterated its "outperform" rating for HTC with a target
price of NT$420, while Goldman Sachs maintained its "buy" rating for the
company.</P>
      <P>BNP Paribas Securities said that it has raised its forecast for the sale of HTC
mobile phones this year by 9 percent -- from 14.5 million to 15.8 million units.
It has also raised its forecast for next year to 21.9 million units, up 22

      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Tuesday that it will do its best to
communicate with European Union parliamentarians over the death penalty in
Taiwan, in an attempt to solicit Schengen visa-free treatment for Taiwanese
nationals.</P>
      <P>MOFA officials made the remarks shortly after Laima Lijcija Andrikiene, an EU
parliamentarian, said during a recent visit to Taiwan that although Taiwan's
seeking Schengen visa-free treatment -- at present consisting of 25 European
countries -- is not directly related to the death penalty, some EU
parliamentarian could use the issue to affect the outcome of a decision on
whether or not to grant visa waivers.</P>
      <P>James K. J. Lee, deputy director-general of MOFA's Department of European
Affairs, said the European Commission could propose to revise related
regulations either this or next month.</P>
      <P>He noted that Taiwan has to make EU countries understand that Taiwan is only
following its own law if it carries out death sentences.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan will reach its final stance on the death penalty only after it forges
consensus through rational debate," Lee said.</P>
      <P>He noted that there are over 700 members of the European Parliament and that the
MOFA might have to "solicit, communicate and explain to some of them" to
mitigate any hindrance to Taiwan's hopes for visa-free privileges for its
people.</P>
      <P>There are currently 44 inmates on death row, but no executions have been carried
out since December 2005.</P>
      <P>Former Justice Minister Wang Ching-feng stepped down last month after she called
for the abolition of capital punishment, only to be met with an outcry from the
families of the victims of violent crimes.</P>

      <P>The consumer price index (CPI) grew 1.27 percent in March from a year earlier,
according to statistics released Tuesday by the Directorate General of Budget,
Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS).</P>
      <P>The DGBAS attributed the rise of the CPI that month to higher prices of fuel,
tobacco and vegetables, with discounts offered for consumer electronic products
offsetting the increase to some extent.</P>
      <P>Consumer prices will rise modestly while the economy recovers, although
inflation should not be a concern for the time being, DGBAS officials said.</P>
      <P>According to the DGBAS tallies, the CPI in March stood at 104.26, down 0.95
percent from the month-earlier level.</P>
      <P>The monthly decrease was due to lower service prices after the Lunar New Year
and seasonal discounts offered by clothing retailers, the DGBAS said.</P>
      <P>The CPI's year-on-year growth averaged 1.29 percent in the first quarter.</P>
      <P>Wu Chao-ming, head of the DGBAS' Third Bureau, said, however, that as the
employment market is still in critical condition and average salaries have not
increased, private consumption has not fully recovered to push up consumer
prices.</P>
      <P>The unemployment rate in February rose slightly to 5.76 percent, with the
jobless population recorded at 634,000, an increase of 8,000 from January.</P>

      <P>The Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) said Tuesday that it is working
toward the goal of allowing Chinese banks to set up footholds in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>FSC Vice Chairman Wu Tang-chieh made the remarks after President Ma Ying-jeou
said during a video conference with Harvard University faculty and students
earlier that day that Taiwan is preparing within the next one or two months to
open Taiwan to Chinese banks seeking to set up footholds here.</P>
      <P>"We're working toward that direction," Wu said.</P>
      <P>Any Chinese banks that decide to investigate setting up footholds in Taiwan will
need to wait until the FSC has made a report on the issue to the Legislative
Yuan's Finance Committee, according to the FSC.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Shanghai Mayor Han Zheng, who arrived in Taipei Tuesday for a four-
day visit, said that he supports the idea of the Shanghai Pudong Development
(SPD) Bank opening a representative office in Taipei soon.</P>
      <P>Wu said,  however,  that the FSC has yet to receive any applications from
Chinese banks in this regard.</P>
      <P>Under regulations unveiled last month governing cross-Taiwan Strait financial
exchanges, five Chinese banks meet the requirements for setting up
representative offices in Taiwan, but the SPD Bank is not one of them.</P>
      <P>The five are Bank of China, ICBC, China Construction Bank, Bank of
Communications and China Merchants Bank.</P>
      <P>Han also said that to better serve Taiwanese people visiting the Shanghai Expo,
which will kick off May 1, Bank of Communications will offer a currency exchange
service so that expo visitors can convert their New Taiwan dollars to the
Chinese yuan and vice versa.</P>

      <P>Liu, who began serving as premier when President Ma Ying-jeou took office May

    <HEADLINE>Travel agencies call for resolving Chinese tourists permit hassles</HEADLINE>

      <P>Travel agencies in Taiwan want to set up a counter at the airports to distribute
entry documents for Chinese tourists coming here, following complaints by the
air carriers that they are currently  doing most of the work in checking  and
distributing the permits.</P>
      <P>Normally, a passenger has to get an entry permit before entering Taiwan.</P>
      <P>But since Taiwan and mainland China do not have representative offices in each
other's territories to handle entry permit issues for Chinese travelers, travel
agencies in the past have had to mail entry permits back to China for the
tourists to use before boarding flights to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>To save time and avoid the travel documents getting lost in the mail, the travel
agencies have asked air carriers to help them distribute the entry permits at
the exit gates as the Chinese tourists are disembarking the plane, so they
wouldn't have to mail the entry permits back to China.</P>
      <P>If an air carrier has ascertained that a passenger has received an entry permit,
it can allow the passenger to board the plane without the permit in China and
pick up the entry permit upon the plane's landing in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The practice is known as "OK board" and is normally used under emergency
conditions.</P>
      <P>Some air carriers have tried to charge travel agencies fees for offering such a
service.</P>
      <P>Due to the quota of Chinese tourists, currently set at 7,200 daily temporarily
until the end of the month, the airlines have also complained that they have
been overloaded with this time-consuming task.</P>
      <P>Hsu Kao-ching, secretary general of the Travel Agent Association of Taiwan, said
that after coordinating with the air carriers, they have consented that no
processing fees will be charged until the end of the month.</P>
      <P>The travel agencies have also cut "OK board" practices, although it cannot be
avoided altogether, he said.</P>
      <P>To provide Chinese tourists with a more speedy service, Hsu said the association
has scouted  a place at the Taiwan  Taoyuan International Airport and proposed
allowing the tourists to pick up their entry permits there upon arrival.</P>
      <P>But Taiwan's National Immigration Agency (NIA) recently rejected the suggested
solution. It said that the passengers must have entry permits to be able to
board a plane, adding that it is the security norm of traveling.</P>
      <P>According to the law, air carriers will be fined heavily if they take on board
passengers who have no legal entry permits.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Global smartphone designer HTC on Tuesday announced first quarter revenues of
NT$37.7 billion (US$1.2 billion), up 19.3 percent year-on-year and higher than
its forecast of NT$32 billion to NT$34 billion.</P>
      <P>The company reported Q1 net profit of NT$5.03 billion, with earnings per share
(EPS) of NT$6.42.</P>
      <P>However, its Q1 revenues and net profits were down 8 percent and 9.2 percent
respectively from Q4 last year.</P>
      <P>The company's revenues rose sharply to NT$16.4 billion in March, an increase of
about 60 percent from February and 32.4 percent compared to the same month last
year.</P>
      <P>According to HTC, the better-than-expected figures prove that it has adopted
successful branding strategies.</P>
      <P>As most institutional investors had expected the company's EPS for Q1 to be
around NT$5 to NT$5.5, its shares are likely to rise Wednesday, analysts said.</P>
      <P>HTC shares closed at NT$381 Tuesday, NT$6.0, or 1.6 percent higher than the
closing figure Monday.</P>
      <P>Most foreign investors are optimistic about HTC's outlook.</P>
      <P>Morgan Stanley recently raised its target price on HTC from NT$423 to NT$450.
Macquarie Securities reiterated its "outperform" rating for HTC with a target
price of NT$420, while Goldman Sachs maintained its "buy" rating for the
company.</P>
      <P>BNP Paribas Securities said that it has raised its forecast for the sale of HTC
mobile phones this year by 9 percent -- from 14.5 million to 15.8 million units.
It has also raised its forecast for next year to 21.9 million units, up 22

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Tuesday that it will do its best to
communicate with European Union parliamentarians over the death penalty in
Taiwan, in an attempt to solicit Schengen visa-free treatment for Taiwanese
nationals.</P>
      <P>MOFA officials made the remarks shortly after Laima Lijcija Andrikiene, an EU
parliamentarian, said during a recent visit to Taiwan that although Taiwan's
seeking Schengen visa-free treatment -- at present consisting of 25 European
countries -- is not directly related to the death penalty, some EU
parliamentarian could use the issue to affect the outcome of a decision on
whether or not to grant visa waivers.</P>
      <P>James K. J. Lee, deputy director-general of MOFA's Department of European
Affairs, said the European Commission could propose to revise related
regulations either this or next month.</P>
      <P>He noted that Taiwan has to make EU countries understand that Taiwan is only
following its own law if it carries out death sentences.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan will reach its final stance on the death penalty only after it forges
consensus through rational debate," Lee said.</P>
      <P>He noted that there are over 700 members of the European Parliament and that the
MOFA might have to "solicit, communicate and explain to some of them" to
mitigate any hindrance to Taiwan's hopes for visa-free privileges for its
people.</P>
      <P>There are currently 44 inmates on death row, but no executions have been carried
out since December 2005.</P>
      <P>Former Justice Minister Wang Ching-feng stepped down last month after she called
for the abolition of capital punishment, only to be met with an outcry from the

    <TEXT>
      <P>The consumer price index (CPI) grew 1.27 percent in March from a year earlier,
according to statistics released Tuesday by the Directorate General of Budget,
Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS).</P>
      <P>The DGBAS attributed the rise of the CPI that month to higher prices of fuel,
tobacco and vegetables, with discounts offered for consumer electronic products
offsetting the increase to some extent.</P>
      <P>Consumer prices will rise modestly while the economy recovers, although
inflation should not be a concern for the time being, DGBAS officials said.</P>
      <P>According to the DGBAS tallies, the CPI in March stood at 104.26, down 0.95
percent from the month-earlier level.</P>
      <P>The monthly decrease was due to lower service prices after the Lunar New Year
and seasonal discounts offered by clothing retailers, the DGBAS said.</P>
      <P>The CPI's year-on-year growth averaged 1.29 percent in the first quarter.</P>
      <P>Wu Chao-ming, head of the DGBAS' Third Bureau, said, however, that as the
employment market is still in critical condition and average salaries have not
increased, private consumption has not fully recovered to push up consumer
prices.</P>
      <P>The unemployment rate in February rose slightly to 5.76 percent, with the
jobless population recorded at 634,000, an increase of 8,000 from January.</P>

      <P>The Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) said Tuesday that it is working
toward the goal of allowing Chinese banks to set up footholds in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>FSC Vice Chairman Wu Tang-chieh made the remarks after President Ma Ying-jeou
said during a video conference with Harvard University faculty and students
earlier that day that Taiwan is preparing within the next one or two months to
open Taiwan to Chinese banks seeking to set up footholds here.</P>
      <P>"We're working toward that direction," Wu said.</P>
      <P>Any Chinese banks that decide to investigate setting up footholds in Taiwan will
need to wait until the FSC has made a report on the issue to the Legislative
Yuan's Finance Committee, according to the FSC.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Shanghai Mayor Han Zheng, who arrived in Taipei Tuesday for a four-
day visit, said that he supports the idea of the Shanghai Pudong Development
(SPD) Bank opening a representative office in Taipei soon.</P>
      <P>Wu said,  however,  that the FSC has yet to receive any applications from
Chinese banks in this regard.</P>
      <P>Under regulations unveiled last month governing cross-Taiwan Strait financial
exchanges, five Chinese banks meet the requirements for setting up
representative offices in Taiwan, but the SPD Bank is not one of them.</P>
      <P>The five are Bank of China, ICBC, China Construction Bank, Bank of
Communications and China Merchants Bank.</P>
      <P>Han also said that to better serve Taiwanese people visiting the Shanghai Expo,
which will kick off May 1, Bank of Communications will offer a currency exchange
service so that expo visitors can convert their New Taiwan dollars to the
Chinese yuan and vice versa.</P>

over a lighting ceremony to inaugurate the Taiwan Hall at the 2010 World Expo in
Shanghai.</P>
      <P>Interior Minister Jiang Yi-huah confirmed Tuesday that the former premier will
visit Shanghai to officially open the Taiwan booth in his capacity as chairman
of the National Cultural Association, a non-profit organization set up by the
government in 1966 to help re-energize Chinese culture.</P>
      <P>Liu, who began serving as premier when President Ma Ying-jeou took office May
20, 2008, resigned Sept. 10 last year to shoulder responsibility  for the
government's bungled rescue and relief operations after Typhoon Morakot
devastated parts of southern and eastern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Jiang said that Liu first applied to visit China April 25-28 to attend a cross-
Taiwan Strait art festival of Chinese characters, but later revised his
application for the Shanghai trip at the invitation of the Taiwan External Trade
Development Council (TAITRA) , which is organizing Taiwan's presence at the
expo.</P>
      <P>Jiang noted that under the law, political appointees seeking to visit China
within three years of resignation must apply for prior government approval.</P>

    <DATELINE>04/07/10  11:48:08
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Finance Lee Sush-der has recently made a number of remarks that have
sparked controversy, including his contention that "the Republic of China has
the best finances."</P>
      <P>One should not comment on finances based on sentiment but should only do so
after examining all aspects objectively.</P>
      <P>In terms of revenue, the government has often cut taxes based on election
considerations or because of pressure from interest groups. In 2009, for
example, the government revenue shortfall hit a record high of NT$265 billion,
and accumulated overdue taxes totaled NT$313.8 billion. Meanwhile, none of the
proposals to adjust the tax system has been put in place, and plans for tax
hikes have repeatedly been postponed. How can we call this tax system good?</P>
      <P>As for expenditures, non-discretionary spending on personnel, education  and
social welfare accounts for 70 percent of the government's total expenditures,
leaving very limited flexibility for discretionary spending.</P>
      <P>Another problem is the high level of government debt. As of the end of 2009,
central government debt -- defined as general obligation debt with a maturity of
over one year -- totaled NT$4.1 trillion, accounting for 33.1 percent of
Taiwan's gross domestic product (GDP). But if hidden debt is added, government
debt totals between NT$14 trillion and NT$20 trillion, far exceeding Taiwan's
annual GDP. Based on this, how can Taiwan's finances be considered good?</P>
      <P>Taiwan suffers from a budget deficit every year, regardless of whether the
economy is good or bad. Can this chronic fiscal imbalance be overlooked? The
government urgently needs to reform the worsening situation to enhance fiscal
sustainability. (April 7, 2010)</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou has not given former Premier Liu Chao-shiuan any specific
mission for his planned visit to Shanghai,  Presidential  Office spokesman  Lo
Chih-chiang  said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>In line with current rules regulating travel to China by former officials, Liu
filed an application with the National Immigration Agency under the Ministry of
the Interior (MOI) Tuesday to visit Shanghai May 11-16 to preside over the
Taiwan Pavilion's formal opening ceremony at the Shanghai World Expo.</P>
      <P>The MOI will first solicit the opinion of Liu's successor, Premier Wu Den-yih,
and then present the case for review by a cross-agency task force.</P>
      <P>As Liu stepped down as premier less than seven months ago, his application has
drawn the attention of the local news media. A newspaper front-page report said
President Ma had appointed Liu to attend the Shanghai Expo lantern-lighting
ceremony.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the report, Lo said Ma has not assigned any mission to Liu.</P>
      <P>"Liu has indeed informed Ma of his plan to travel to Shanghai, but the president
has not given him any mission or directive, " Lo said.</P>
      <P>Lo further said the former premier's planned Shanghai visit is purely a cultural
event and has nothing to do with politics.</P>
      <P>The China Times reported Wednesday in a front-page story that Liu will depart on
a visit to Shanghai May 11 in his capacity as president of Taiwan's National
Cultural Association.</P>
      <P>Liu was quoted as having confirmed the travel plan, saying that he was invited
by Taiwan External Trade Development Council Chairman Wang Chih-kang to attend
the Taiwan Pavilion's official opening ceremony.</P>
      <P>On the question of whether his visit to China less than a year after his
retirement from government service was proper, Liu said he will visit Shanghai
as a private cultural promoter.</P>
      <P>"I will meet with academics and people in cultural circles in the Shanghai area
to promote cultural and academic exchanges, " Liu was quoted as saying by the
newspaper. "It is an appropriate and very meaningful event."</P>
      <P>On the suggestion that he should wait three years before making any visit to
China,  Liu recalled that the former Democratic Progressive Party administration
approved his visit to China in 2001, less than a year after he stepped down as
deputy premier in 2000.</P>
      <P>Former National Security Council Secretary-General Su Chi was forced to cancel a
plan to attend the Boao Forum for Asia in Hainan, China after critics said he
should not visit China shortly after leaving government service.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Talk of the day -- Ma reaffirms reform in Harvard video conference</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>04/07/10  12:31:40
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou's approval ratings remain low, but he made clear during a
video conference with faculty and students at his alma mater Harvard University
Tuesday that he will continue to push reforms, "regardless of the opinion polls
or even the chances of a second term."</P>
      <P>Ma said he was elected because people wanted reform, and he contended that if he
managed to improve the economy, implement reform and demonstrate strong
leadership, his popularity would bounce back.</P>
      <P>During the forum, Ma also answered questions on some of his controversial
policies,  including rapprochement in cross-Taiwan Strait ties and a proposal to
sign an economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) with Beijing.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from local media coverage of the forum:</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>President Ma regarded signing the cross-strait ECFA as part of an obvious  trend
if Taiwan  wants to avoid  being economically marginalized. He said Taiwan is 10
years late in taking the step, which he described as very crucial to the
country.</P>
      <P>He also  said  firmly  that he believes  the government's cross-strait policy is
on the right track, and that his government will insist on doing what is right
while trying its best to explain to the public the government's policy.</P>
      <P>"I have always considered mainland China both a risk and an opportunity. My
policy is to maximize the opportunity, but minimize the risk, " he said,
stressing that he will continue efforts to lower cross-strait tensions and
remove the Taiwan Strait from among the region's potential hot spots. (April 7,
2010).</P>
      <P>Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>Harvard scholar Steven M. Goldstein and the audience at Harvard at the forum
aggressively questioned the Ma government's cross-strait policy. He asked Ma how
he would handle, over the next two years, the dilemma of China not showing signs
of giving up its military threat against Taiwan while claiming to do things in
favor of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Another questioner brought up Ma's approval ratings and asked him why he was so
unpopular. In response, Ma said he will focus on the job  at  hand  regardless
of  opinion  polls  or re-election considerations.</P>
      <P>Contending that people chose him as president because they hoped for change and
reform, Ma said he believes his popularity will rebound if he meets people's
expectations by reviving the economy, carrying out reforms and exhibiting strong
leadership.</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>In response to a question about the controversy in Taiwan over whether to scrap
the death penalty, Ma reiterated that the death penalty is not the only way to
lower serious crime.</P>
      <P>In order to prevent dangerous inmates from harming society after being released
from jail, Ma said the country has extended the time convicts sentenced to life
imprisonment must serve before being eligible for parole, from 20 years to 25
years.</P>
      <P>He also indicated Taiwan is considering changing the procedures leading up to
the sentencing of a defendant to the death penalty.</P>
      <P>"What the government should do is to provide the opportunity, the platform for
rational discussion and debate, and try to find out the solution," Ma said.

(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of the Interior  recently relaxed regulations governing  the
transfer  of Chinese  employees  to Taiwan  by multinational companies, allowing
extensions of up to three years upon the expiration of the workers' permitted
duration of stay in Taiwan. Before the amendment, the allowable extension was up
to one year.</P>
      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) , however, is against the
amendment. In addition to appealing to the fear of communist spies, the DPP also
argued that the amendment would pave the way for the entry of Chinese laborers
and technical workers.</P>
      <P>In fact, the DPP's concerns are unwarranted. First, those Chinese workers sent
by multinational businesses to Taiwan are white-collar managerial-level
personnel, who account for only small numbers and are unrelated to opening
Taiwan to Chinese laborers.</P>
      <P>Second, communist spies have long been all around us. Those supervisors assigned
to Taiwan are not necessarily spies, and there is no need to get terrified.</P>
      <P>Complex bureaucratic controls are the phantom that is scaring foreign investors
away. Deregulation of laws has long been overdue in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>It is correct for the government to amend the regulations. The green camp has no
need to exaggerate the risks. (April 7, 2010)</P>

      <P>After fully understanding the pros and cons at a recent debate on the proposed
Taiwan-China economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) , an invited jury
of 16 undergraduates judged in favor of the opponent.</P>
      <P>Frankly speaking, if undergraduates understand what an ECFA is, they will
certainly oppose the proposal. Based on factor-price equalization, the high
wages of Taiwanese workers will be dragged down if Taiwan and China open their
markets to each other. This means that Taiwanese university graduates will have
to face lower starting salaries and competition from Chinese job-seekers.</P>
      <P>The administration of President Ma Ying-jeou may say that Chinese workers will
definitely not be allowed into Taiwan. However, does the promise include a
sunset clause or is it for good?  The Ma administration has obviously failed to
give a clear explanation of the issue, not to mention a firm guarantee.</P>
      <P>According to recently amended regulations governing the transfer of Chinese
employees to Taiwan by multinational companies, extensions of up to three years
are allowed after the expiration of the workers' permitted duration of stay. The
regulations allow Chinese nationals to work in Taiwan under multinational
companies using the term "internal transfers." Aren't such loose restrictions
equal to opening Taiwan to Chinese workers?</P>
      <P>After Chinese capital is allowed into Taiwan following the signing of the ECFA,
Chinese businesses with investment in Taiwan will definitely use the excuse of
"internal transfers" to introduce large numbers of Chinese blue-collar and
white-collar workers into Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, the concessions offered by China are only lip service, talk of
cross-Taiwan Strait brotherhood is merely publicity, and promises by the Ma
administration are just empty rhetoric that we can never believe in. (April 7,

    <TEXT>
      <P>There is no clear correlation between a perceived decline in entry-level pay in
the private sector and a government internship program that pays new university
graduates NT$22,000 (US$696.20) a month, a senior official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) Minister Wang Ju-hsuan was responding to
criticism from labor rights groups over a comment she made in an interview with
the CommonWealth Magazine on the internship program.</P>
      <P>Wang told the magazine that the NT$22,000 monthly salary given to new university
and college graduates working as interns under the program "wasn't bad, "
because many of them might not have found work in the soft labor market if the
program had not been launched.</P>
      <P>"When the new graduate internship program was launched last year, there were
actually few job openings available, " Wang was quoted as saying. "New college
and university graduates should not complain about the salary.... Without this
program, they would not be earning anything."</P>
      <P>Wang explained Wednesday that most private companies  were reluctant to hire any
new employees last year amid a global economic slump and said the approach at
the time for first-time job seekers was to "try and get a job first and then
look for something better."</P>
      <P>Labor rights activist groups disagreed with Wang's assessment that the pay level
"wasn't bad, " arguing that entry-level salaries have fallen because of the
internship program, more commonly known as the "22K" program.</P>
      <P>But Wang responded Wednesday that the correlation is not as clear-cut as critics
have alleged, adding that she was actually against the "22K" program at the time
because the NT$22,000 per month subsidy financed by taxpayers was too high.</P>
      <P>A group of opposition  Democratic Progressive  Party (DPP) lawmakers urged Wang
to apologize for her comments on the program.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Lee Chun-yee said the "22K" program, advertised by the government
as giving new job-seekers immediate job opportunities, had only helped reduce
the unemployment rate marginally in 2009, from 5.98 percent to 5.94 percent.</P>
      <P>Lee also contended that Wang's remarks indicated that President Ma Ying-jeou's
administration had failed to put itself in other people's shoes in formulating
policy, and he said Wang should apologize or step down from her post.</P>

      <P>Robert Horry, one of only nine players to have won at least seven National
Basketball Association (NBA) championships, is scheduled to visit Taiwan next
week for the official launch of the NBA's traditional Chinese character Web
site, organizers said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Horry, who collected one more championship ring in his 17-year NBA career
(1992-2008) than Michael Jordan, will visit Taiwan from April 14-16 and attend
the launching ceremony of the NBA.com/Taiwan Web site, a collaboration of local
sports Web site Pixnet and the NBA, Pixnet announced in a statement.</P>
      <P>According to Pixnet, basketball-crazy Taiwan at one point ranked third, behind
the U.S. and Canada, in visitors to the NBA's official Web site.</P>
      <P>One of only three players to win consecutive NBA championships with two
different teams -- the Houston Rockets and the Los Angeles Lakers -- Horry was
best known for his clutch three-point shooting in the playoffs, earning him the
nickname "Big Shot Bob."</P>
      <P>The 208-centimeter sweet-shooting forward still holds the record for most career
three-pointers made in the NBA Finals and is second on the all-time list for
three-pointers made in the playoffs.</P>
      <P>Hong Kong-based  media company TOM Group Limited signed a four-year deal with
the NBA in 2008 for the rights to operate the NBA Web site in China, Taiwan and
Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese fans complained, however, that the company merely converted text in
simplified Chinese characters, used in China, into traditional Chinese
characters for the Taiwanese audience, neglecting the differences in basketball
terms and the transliteration of player names between Taiwan and China.</P>

      <P>Taiwanese business leaders, including Hon Hai Group Chairman Terry Gou, had
breakfast with visiting Shanghai Mayor Han Zheng Wednesday, the second day of
the Chinese official's high-profile visit to the island.</P>
      <P>At the event hosted by Taiwan External Trade Development Council Chairman Wang
Chih-kang and Taipei-based Chinese National Federation of Industries (CNFI)
Chairman Chen Wu-hsiung, Han expressed hope for more cooperation with Taiwanese
businesspeople operating in Shanghai.</P>
      <P>Han's wish drew a positive response from Chen, who said that over two-thirds of
the federation's more than 90,000 members had invested in the mainland. He said
he looked forward to more cross-strait cooperation, saying the two sides could
"work together to earn money from around the world."</P>
      <P>Wang lauded the Taiwan Pavilion that will be part of the Shanghai World
Exposition in May. It will be the first time in 40 years that Taiwan
participates in the expo.</P>
      <P>The breakfast was also attended by Ting Hsin Group Chairman Wei Ying-chiao,
Delta Electronics Group Chairman Bruce C.H. Cheng, Cathay Financial Holdings

      <P>Delta Group's Cheng took advantage of the meeting's media attention  to announce
his  company's  plans  to develop  an electricity-powered automobile.</P>
      <P>Cheng said that Delta Electronics is developing the electric automobile industry
in Taiwan and on the mainland "at the same time," noting that while operating a
large research and development base in Taiwan's Taoyuan area, the company has
also opened a research and development center in Shanghai's Pudong district.</P>
      <P>Asked whether he hoped that China would offer preferential investment
opportunities, the business tycoon answered that Shanghai had already provided
Taiwan enterprises many, including cheap land.</P>
      <P>Cheng said that "when doing business you should rely on your own strength and

      <P>The government's recent changes in regulations regarding short stays of Chinese
professionals in Taiwan will not affect Taiwan's employment market, Interior
Minister Jiang Yi-huah told a news conference Wednesday.</P>
      <P>In line with recently revised regulations, Chinese salaried workers are allowed
to make short-term stays here for visit, study or to attend meetings for a
period up to three months, Jiang said.</P>
      <P>These short-term visitors from China are not permitted to engage in paying jobs
while in Taiwan, and they will not become either white-collar or blue-collar
workers, he said.</P>
      <P>Jiang was responding  to charges by opposition  Democratic Progressive  Party
(DPP)  lawmakers  that  visits  by Chinese professionals had already doubled in
the past year, and that the government's easing of restrictions on their visits
was opening a channel that would be abused to allow Chinese into Taiwan to work.</P>

to Chinese workers  in an economic  framework cooperation agreement (ECFA) it is
currently negotiating with China.</P>
      <P>Jiang denied that looser restrictions on professional visits meant opening the
doors to Chinese workers.</P>
      <P>In the past, he said, local companies whose annual revenue was over NT$30
million were allowed to invite 200 Chinese professionals to visit Taiwan, while
those with an annual revenue below that level could invite 45.</P>
      <P>The policy change will now allow companies whose annual revenue exceeds NT$100
million to invite 400 persons a year.</P>
      <P>Citing statistics compiled by his ministry, Jiang reported that from 2005-2009,

      <P>A team of astrophysicists from Academia Sinica and Japan have captured a
snapshot showing the growth of a galaxy cluster for the first time, according to
a press release issued by Taiwan's top research institute.</P>
      <P>Academia  Sinica's  Postdoctoral  Fellow Nobuhiro Okabe and Associate Research
Fellow Keiichi Umetsu from the Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics at
Academia Sinica (ASIAA) cooperated with Madoka Kawaharada, special postdoctoral
researcher from the Institute of Physical and Chemical Research (RIKEN) in
Japan, to develop the result.</P>
      <P>Galaxy clusters are composed of thousands of galaxies and X-ray-emitting hot gas
as well as dark matter. The research team has revealed a snapshot of the
dramatic growth of a galaxy cluster titled "Abell 1689."</P>
      <P>According to their study, which will be published online in "The Astrophysics
Journal" on April 9, the cluster grows through heating that is triggered by
matter falling from a filamentary large-scale structure outside the cluster
known as a "cosmic web."</P>
      <P>Using Japan's Suzaku X-ray satellite, the team was able to measure emissions
from hot gas in the outermost regions of Abell 1689. They discovered that the
anisotropic temperature distribution of the hot gas is 58 million degrees
Celsius in one direction and 23 million degrees in the other around the boundary
of the cluster.</P>
      <P>They then compared their X-ray data with a galaxy map made from Sloan Digital
Sky Survey (SDSS) data as well as with "gravitational lensing" data from the
Japanese Subaru telescope and the Hubble Space Telescope, eventually finding
that the cooler gas is likely to have subsonic motion.</P>
      <P>Analyzing the X-ray, optical and gravitational lensing data, the team developed
a clear snapshot showing the growth of the galaxy cluster being affected by the
large-scale structure in which clusters are embedded.</P>
      <P>"This new finding provides proof and inspires further research in this field, "

      <P>A girl from Myanmar expressed her gratitude Wednesday after facial
reconstruction surgery by a Taiwanese medical team.</P>
      <P>Nine-year-old Mi Tho, who arrived in Taiwan Feb. 27 to receive the procedure at
Taipei's Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, will return home Thursday.</P>
      <P>On the eve of her departure, the girl presented surgeon Lo Lun-jou and nurse
Chou Su-yeh pictures she had drawn while recovering and said "thank you" in
Mandarin in appreciation for their care and services.</P>
      <P>According to the hospital, Mi Tho was born with a cleft lip, a cleft palate, an
exposed nasolacrimal sac and without a nose ridge. As a result, she had
difficulty speaking properly.</P>
      <P>Her condition came to the attention of the Global Hope Network International
(GHNI) in 2008, when the humanitarian aid organization was operating a rescue
mission in Myanmar in the wake of a hurricane.</P>
      <P>With the help of GHNI, Mi Tho received cleft lip and palate treatment in her
country in 2009 but failed to see significant improvement. She was later
transferred to Chang Gung Hospital using funds from the World Craniofacial
Foundation and Taiwan's Noordhoff Craniofacial Foundation.</P>
      <P>Lo said one person in 50,000 is born with a cleft lip and palate and at the same
time without a nose ridge.</P>
      <P>The most difficult part of the surgery was reconstructing the girl's nose ridge,
which involved removing a fragment of her sixth right rib for implantation into
her face, Lo said.</P>
      <P>He said the medical  team also treated  Mi Tho's exposed nasolacrimal sac and
her cleft lip and palate, successfully improving her appearance. With practice,
the girl should now be able to pronounce words correctly, he added.</P>
      <P>Mi Tho has another condition -- extreme width between her eyes -- that the
medical team determined should only be treated after she reaches adulthood, Lo
said.</P>

could see their pension cut or eliminated if new legislation passes the
legislature.</P>
      <P>Currently,  civil servants found to be corrupt, guilty of dereliction  of duty
or other misconduct  can sometimes evade punishment by retiring early or
quitting their jobs.</P>
      <P>But once a raft of draft amendments to the current statute governing the
discipline of civil servants clears the legislature, they will no longer be able
to do so, lawmakers said.</P>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan's Judiciary and Organic Laws and Statutes Committee
finalized a first review of the draft package earlier in the day, which includes
a "retroactivity clause" to legalize forfeit of overall retirement pension or
severance pay or a 10 percent to 20 percent cut in such payments for malfeasant
officials who resign or apply for early retirement to avoid discipline.</P>
      <P>The draft "retroactivity clause" also stipulates that retiring or departing
public servants who failed to carry out their official duties can be slapped
with fines ranging  between  NT$10,000 (US$316.46) and NT$1 million.</P>
      <P>The "retroactivity clause, " if passed, will also be applied to political
appointees, the Judicial Yuan said in a statement served to the legislature.</P>
      <P>The Judicial Yuan, which initiated the draft package, said that the existing
disciplinary sanctions for public functionaries, such as job deprivation,
suspension from work, pay cuts, reprimand, demerit and demotion, are not
effective enough to deter government workers from malfeasance or dereliction of
duty because they can evade penalties by early retirement or resignation.</P>
      <P>The draft package also stipulates that military service members should not apply
for retirement so long as the Commission on the Disciplinary Sanctions of Public
Functionaries is still screening relevant disciplinary cases involving them or
the Control Yuan is screening relevant impeachment cases and that they will also
be subject to the same "retroactivity" regulations.</P>
      <P>The package of draft bills further proposes that public servants should not take
jobs at other public agencies or state-owned enterprises when they are suspended
from their original work and that the period of suspension should not be shorter
than six months nor longer than three years.</P>
      <P>They will also be prohibited from getting any promotion or being transferred to
a leading position within two years of returning to work.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the package proposes a new clause that authorizes discipline of
public servants who do anything seriously detrimental to the government's
credibility or reputation, even though such moves have not violated any law
regarding their official duties.</P>
      <P>All new disciplinary proposals included in the package passed the legislative
committee's first review, but individual lawmakers remain divided on the
duration of "retroactive  periods" for various disciplinary measures, which are
subject to consultations between ruling and opposition parties before the
package is put up for a second reading at the legislative plenary session</P>

    <HEADLINE>President pledges support for islandwide cultural development</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Wednesday that the government  will continue  give
priority to cultural development, no matter which party is in power.</P>
      <P>At a groundbreaking ceremony for the Wei-Wu-Ying Center for the Performing Arts
in Kaohsiung, Ma said the government must achieve balance in terms of cultural
development in the north and south of the island as well as in building
infrastructure and installing cultural "software."</P>
      <P>Towards this end, the NT$9.97 billion arts center in southern Taiwan will be
built as a world-class facility, bigger than the National Chiang Kai Shek
Cultural Center in Taipei, he said. Its theater will have a seating capacity of
2,260, compared to 1,522 at the National Theater Hall in Taipei, he added.</P>
      <P>Ma said that despite the government's tight budget, funding for the construction
of the Kaohsiung arts center remains in place.</P>
      <P>In addition to the Wei-Wu-Ying center, a maritime cultural and pop music center
is being built in Kaohsiung City, southern Taiwan, Ma noted, adding that the
government should also have a role in expanding the people's involvement in
culture.</P>
      <P>Ma said that he believes the Wei-Wu-Ying center will be put to the good use
because some 200 performing groups have settled in southern Taiwan as a result
of the Cultural and Creative Industries Act and revised regulations which allow
subsidies for such groups.</P>
      <P>The president also said he has asked chairman of the National Chiang Kai Shek
Cultural Center Kuo Wei-fan to arrange for the Wei-Wu-Ying center to also host
shows that have been staged in Taipei.</P>
      <P>The 10-hectare Wei-Wu-Ying center, scheduled to be completed in 2013, will
comprise a 2,000-seat Concert Hall, a 2,260-seat Lyric Theater, a 470-seat Play
House, a 1,254-seat Experimental Theater and other service facilities.</P>
      <P>The Dutch firm Mecanoo Architecten B.V. won the contract for the design of the
center.</P>

      <P>Opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) Chairman Huang Kun-huei demanded
Wednesday that the government immediately publish a list of goods put forth by
China that could receive priority tax cuts after recent cross-Taiwan Strait
trade talks.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a news conference, Huang cited anonymous government sources as
saying China put a 700-item "early harvest list" on the negotiating table during
last week's second round of talks on a proposed economic cooperation framework
agreement (ECFA).</P>
      <P>China demands preferential or zero-tariff privileges from Taiwan for the 700
items, Huang said, adding that they are mainly in the telecommunications,
information, financial and media sectors -- industries in which Taiwan is
competitive.</P>
      <P>"This will affect the livelihoods of more than 630,000 Taiwanese workers," he
said, citing statistics compiled by the Council of Labor Affairs which show that
as of February, 207,000 Taiwanese worked in the IT and communications sectors
and 425,000 in the financial and insurance sectors.</P>
      <P>"In total, China's 'early harvest list' could affect the lives of more than 1
million Taiwanese people," he said.</P>
      <P>Huang also criticized the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) for saying the signing
of the ECFA is to protect vulnerable industries and the underprivileged in
Taiwan. "The MAC has become a propaganda machine of the government sector," he
said.</P>
      <P>C. S. Liu, deputy executive director of the major opposition Democratic
Progressive Party, said China was trying to expand its strategic position by
gaining control of Taiwan's key industries. "This is terrible," he said.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan's signing of an ECFA with China will only benefit certain enterprises at
home, and China will benefit the most," he said.</P>

      <P>More than 50 companies in Taiwan's information  and communications  technology
(ICT)  and service industries launched an alliance Wednesday in bid to grab a
share of the growing cloud computing market.</P>
      <P>Cloud computing, which means outsourcing online data storage and applications,
will effectively lower companies' operational costs and reduce systematic risk,
Chunghwa Telecom Co. Chairman Lu Shyue-ching said at the inauguration of the
Taiwan Cloud Computing Consortium in Taipei.</P>
      <P>"Cloud computing is an ongoing revolution in the information industry, " said
Lu. "It makes data management easy, cheap and time-efficient and is also energy-
saving and eco-friendly."</P>
      <P>According to Lu, who is head of the new consortium, Taiwan will be able to boost
the production value of its ICT industries by investing in cloud computing.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan's ICT hardware industry will generate an estimated production value of
US$366 billion by 2020, while the ICT software industry is forecast to grow from
US$20 billion in 2009 to US$50 billion in 2014," he said.</P>
      <P>The share of the software industry in the entire ICT industry will increase from
15 percent to 25 percent during that period, Lu forecast.</P>
      <P>Globally, the production value of the consumer service component of the cloud
computing industry would grow from US$38.7 billion in 2008 to US$101.8 billion
in 2012, representing a compound annual growth rate of 26 percent, he said,
citing Ministry of Economics Affairs figures.</P>
      <P>The output of business applications in the industry is projected to rise from
US$59 billion in 2008 to US$213.3 billion in 2012, at a compound annual growth
rate of 38 percent, Lu added.</P>
      <P>In addition, the output of computing service in the industry would grow by a
compound annual rate of 90 percent, increasing from US$3.4 billion in 2008 to
US$94.5 billion in 2012, he added.</P>
      <P>The consortium aims to promote three aspects of cloud computing --
infrastructure, platform and software -- and will also develop a platform to
incorporate energy-saving technologies, he said.</P>
      <P>The inaugural ceremony showcased cloud computing applications in personalized
Internet TV, personal health care, education, street image and video
conferencing and featured a mobile data center developed by Taiwan's Inventec
Corp., the world's largest server maker.</P>
      <P>The center, which looks like a container, can accommodate 576 servers and 1,200
hard drives, said Richard Lee, chairman of the company and deputy head of the
consortium.</P>
      <P>"It can be used by a company with up to 3,000 employees and can help save 20
percent in costs," he added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Wednesday that if Taiwan completes four major tasks,
its economic performance this year will be better than last year.</P>
      <P>Ma said the World Bank predicted earlier in the year that Taiwan's economy would
reach 4.5 percent this year, the highest among the "four Asian tigers, " which
also comprise South Korea, Hong Kong and Singapore.</P>
      <P>Without directly saying whether Taiwan could reach the target, Ma outlined four
tasks for the country.</P>
      <P>The first is to bring down unemployment and create jobs, Ma said, adding that
the Executive Yuan hopes to decrease the unemployment rate to less than 5
percent this year. He said this would be a challenge for the government because
it needs to create a lot of jobs to reach the goal.</P>
      <P>To this end, private investment and consumption should also be expanded along
with the implementation of other economic stimulus projects, Ma said.</P>
      <P>He also said that the legislature needs to clear an industrial innovation bill
this year. The bill aims to meet the needs of industrial development and
innovation by offering tax incentives to replace those that were lost when the
Statute for Industrial Upgrading expired at the end of 2009.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, more efforts should be made in energy conservation and carbon
reduction, said Ma, adding that the country should work to develop several
emerging industries -- including the green energy and LED industries -- that are
vital to economic growth.</P>
      <P>Taiwan should join regional economic integration to allow it to keep abreast
with economic growth in Asia, Ma said.</P>
      <P>Chinese tourist arrivals made a great contribution to Taiwan's economy last
year, Ma said, citing statistics that found the 970,000 visits made by Chinese
tourists contributed to 0.49 percent of Taiwan's GDP last year.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks after being briefed on the overall economic situation this
year by Council for Economic Planning and Development Chairman Tsai Hsung-
hsiung.</P>
      <P>Tsai reported that as the global economy recovers, the government expects
private investment in Taiwan will reach NT$1.857 trillion this year.</P>

      <P>Former Premier Liu Chao-shiuan said Wednesday his planned visit to Shanghai is
purely for the promotion of Taiwanese culture and has absolutely nothing to do
with politics.</P>
      <P>In line with current rules regulating travel to China by former officials, Liu
filed an application with the National Immigration Agency under the Ministry of
the Interior (MOI) Tuesday to visit Shanghai May 11-16 for the formal opening of
the Taiwan Pavilion at the 2010 Shanghai World Expo.</P>
      <P>The MOI will first solicit the opinion of Liu's successor, Premier Wu Den-yih on
the application and then present the case to a cross-agency task force for
review.</P>
      <P>As Liu stepped down as premier less than seven months ago, his application has
drawn the attention media attention locally and objections from the opposition
parties.</P>
      <P>Liu,  who is now president  of Taiwan's National Cultural Association (NCA),
said in an interview with the Central News Agency that President Ma Ying-jeou
has been informed of his plan to visit Shanghai to officiate at the Taiwan
Pavilion opening ceremony.</P>
      <P>"This is a very good thing...It is very fitting for me to attend the event in my
capacity as the NCA head, " Liu said, adding that his current mission is to
promote Taiwanese culture and he is more than willing to attend the Shanghai
event to fulfill his duty.</P>
      <P>During his planned visit, Liu said, he may also take part in some cultural,
artistic or academic activities. "But I will not be involved in any political
events during my stay," he stressed.</P>
      <P>On the suggestion that he should wait three years before making any visits to
China, Liu recalled that the former Democratic Progressive Party administration
approved his visit to China in 2001, less than a year after he stepped down as
deputy premier in 2000.</P>
      <P>Former National Security Council Secretary-General Su Chi was forced to cancel a
plan to attend the Boao Forum for Asia in Hainan, China after critics said he
should not visit China so soon after leaving government office.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Presidential Office spokesman Lo Chih-chiang said earlier in the day
that President Ma is aware of Liu's travel plans but has not given any specific
directives for Liu to carry out during his planned visit.</P>
      <P>Lo further said the former premier's planned visit to Shanghai is purely a
cultural matter and has nothing to do with politics.</P>
      <P>In response,  the opposition Democratic  Progressive  Party reiterated that it
is opposed to Liu's Shanghai travel plans at this time because of national
security concerns.</P>
      <P>"We do not understand why many former senior officials of the Ma administration
want to visit China so soon after they leave office, " said DPP spokesman Tsai
Chi-chang. "What is their purpose or motivation? Would such visits benefit
Taiwan? The administration has not given clear any explanation."</P>
      <P>While the DPP supports normal exchanges across the Taiwan Strait, Tsai said, it
is worried that the Ma administration may send former officials to conduct
behind-the-scenes political negotiations with China.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's Trans Asia Airways announced Wednesday that it will launch non-stop
flights from Kaohsiung City in southern Taiwan to Xiamen and Fuzhou cities in
southeastern China's Fujian Province this week.</P>
      <P>According to the Taipei-based carrier, it will use 182-seat Airbus 321 planes to
ply the two routes.</P>
      <P>The airline said it will start the weekly Kaohsiung-Fuzhou route from Thursday
and the Kaohsiung- Xiamen route from Friday, mainly to serve the many Taiwanese

      <P>Taiwan promoted its investment environment to investors from China's biggest
city Shanghai at an investment presentation held Wednesday in the capital city.</P>
      <P>Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA) Chairman Wang Chih-kang said
geographically, Taiwan is in the center of the entire Asia-Pacific region.</P>
      <P>"It is shorter to travel from Taipei to Shanghai than from Beijing to Shanghai,"
Wang said.</P>
      <P>Therefore, Wang said he believes Taipei and Taiwan are the "ideal spot" for
Chinese enterprises to open Asia-Pacific operational headquarters.</P>
      <P>The presentation targeted an audience of Shanghai companies' representatives who
are visiting Taiwan as part of a delegation led by Shanghai Mayor Han Zheng.</P>
      <P>Attending the presentation were more than 50 Shanghai companies, including the
SAIC Motor, Bailian Group and Shimao Group. The event was jointly organized by
the TAITRA, the Taipei-based Chinese National Federation of Industries (CNFI)
and Shanghai's Council for the Promotion of International Trade.</P>
      <P>The Chinese businesses are mostly big enterprises whose assets were reported
totalling over NT$1 trillion each.</P>
      <P>Han arrived in Taipei on Tuesday for a four-day visit, which is regarded as the
climax of 10 years of exchanges between the capital city and Shanghai that began
in 2001 when President Ma Ying-jeou was Taipei's mayor.</P>
      <P>At the event Wednesday, Han said he will encourage Shanghai enterprises to
invest in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Since the first Taiwanese investor went to Shanghai in 1987, the city has become
a heaven of Taiwanese investments. Han said he hopes Taiwan will also become a
heaven of Chinese investments.</P>
      <P>The mayor expressed that by linking Shanghai and Taiwan together, he believes
companies on each side of the Taiwan Strait will be able to enjoy better
development.</P>
      <P>The presentation was part of Han's tight schedule on his second-day stay in
Taipei, which started with a breakfast meeting with Taiwan's influential
entrepreneurs. Later in the day, Han rode together with Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-
bin on the city's Mass Rapid Transit Danshui Line and visited the Beitou
Incinerator.</P>
      <P>Also on his agenda is a visit to Taipei's popular tourist attractions, including
the National Palace Museum, the Taipei 101 skyscraper and the Eslite Bookstore
in the bustling Xinyi district, according to the city government.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwanese golfer Yani Tseng has vaulted to second in the women's world golf
rankings after winning the Kraft Nabisco Championship, the first major
tournament of the season, leaving her in good position to make a run at
dethroning long-time world No. 1 Lorena Ochoa.</P>
      <P>Tseng, who started last week ranked sixth, regained the spot she had occupied
between Nov. 24, 2008 and Aug. 31, 2009 after her one-shot victory in the Kraft
Nabisco. She has not been ranked outside the top six since winning her first
major, the LPGA Championship, in June 2008.</P>
      <P>The rankings are determined by a complicated formula weighting players'
performances over the past 104 weeks on all major women's professional golf
tours around the world.</P>
      <P>Points earned based on tournament finishes are divided by tournaments played to
give a points average used to rank the players. Anything over a 10 is considered
phenomenal.</P>
      <P>Ochoa who has reigned as the top player in woman 's golf for 155 weeks, averaged
over 13 for much of 2009, far outdistancing Tseng and other challengers.</P>
      <P>Tseng had fallen as far as sixth in the rankings after suffering through an
inconsistent second half of 2009, but her recent surge (she also won the
Australian Women's Open in mid-March) and Ochoa's inability to reproduce her
incredible run between 2006-2008 have pulled the two much closer.</P>
      <P>Ochoa, who won only three events in 2009 after averaging seven tour wins per
year the previous three years and who has not won a major in two years, has
grown vulnerable at the top, falling to an average of 9.34, only 0.53 ahead of
Tseng' s 8.81.</P>
      <P>Another LPGA tournament win by Tseng could end Ochoa's reign, but Tseng herself
has to be careful about maintaining her own standing as another three top
players -- Korea's Jiyai Shin, Norway's Suzann Pettersen, and Japan's Ai
Miyazato -- are fairly closely bunched behind the 21-year-old Taiwanese.</P>
      <P>Aside from soaring up the world rankings, Tseng catapulted to the top of other
major lists by winning this past weekend's major in Rancho Mirage, California.</P>
      <P>Her US$300,000 first prize made her the leading prize money winner on the LPGA
Tour after its first four events of the year.</P>
      <P>She also moved into the top spot in the standings for the highly coveted LPGA
Player of the Year award, ahead of Miyazato and Pettersen.</P>

      <P>A pavilion in the shape of an ark built with 1.5 million recyclable plastic PET
bottles was unveiled Wednesday ahead of the Taipei Int'l Flora Expo scheduled to
open Nov. 6.</P>
      <P>The pavilion promoting the concept of environmental conservation was the only
one among 14 expo pavilions that was designed and constructed by a private
enterprise. The structure cost the Far Eastern Group NT$100 million and can be
dismantled for future use after the expo concludes.</P>
      <P>Douglas Hsu, chairman of the Far Eastern Group, said earlier plans had called
for the use of 1 million bottles for the facility, but it eventually took 1.5
million bottles to complete the 130-meter, nine-story pavilion.</P>
      <P>Taiwan produces more than 2.4 billion PET bottles annually, of which only 4
percent are recycled, Hsu said. The others are disposed of as nondegradable
garbage, damaging the environment, he said.</P>
      <P>After being specially processed, the transparent bottles were used to provide
protection from the wind, sun and rain, while also insulating the pavilion, Hsu
said.</P>
      <P>To promote environmental awareness by making good use of PET bottles, the group
is scheduled in August to launch souvenir LED light balls in four colors that
can be attached to any type of PET bottle and used as portable flashlights, Hsu
added.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's semi-official Institute for Information Industry unveiled technologies
Wednesday to meet demands for digital reading and help local publishing and
media industries in their transformation to the digital age.</P>
      <P>"The Content Roaming Service System (C.Ro.S.S.) technology, or seamless reading
technology, allows one to stick with a certain page of an e-book on different
devices, " said Nick Cheng, an engineer of the institute's Innovative DigiTech-
Enabled Applications  and Services Institute.</P>
      <P>"The devices can be a smartphone, a computer or an e-reader," he said at a
ceremony in Taipei. "With the technology, you can read a book on a cell phone on
the subway and continue to read the book on a big screen equipped with the Wi-Fi
wireless technology when you get home."</P>
      <P>Cheng showed how to transfer a digital content from one device to another by
swiping a finger across a cell phone screen.</P>
      <P>Cheng's colleague demonstrated how digital content automatically fits the screen
of a computer screen, a smartphone or an e-reader by using another new
technology to process the content first.</P>
      <P>"These new technologies will bring opportunities for content providers,  " Yu
Kuo-ting, the head of the Magazine Business Association of Taipei, said at the
ceremony.</P>
      <P>Shih Mu-piao, vice president of Chunghwa Telecom Co. -- Taiwan's largest
telecommunications company -- said he hopes the technologies will be widely
adopted in the world.</P>
      <P>Danny Yao, vice president of BenQ Asia Pacific and president of BenQ Taiwan,
urged local publishers to work together to quickly overcome difficulties in
digital content conversion, pricing and digital copyright.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwanese lovers to cycle around the world in 30 months</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taoyuan, Taiwan April 7 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>A Taiwanese couple are embarking on a cycling trip that would take them to four
continents in 30 months to promote the centenary of the Republic of China
(Taiwan), as well as environmental awareness and Taiwanese products.</P>
      <P>Lin Hsiau-kai, 37, and his girlfriend Yen Yi-hui, 27, began their
55,000-kilometer trip on Wednesday by flying from Taoyuan International Airport
to Bangkok, Thailand, where the cycling will begin.</P>
      <P>"Ever since I was a high school freshman in 1986, I've dreamt about taking this
trip and it has finally come true. But the road is long and there's a big
challenge ahead, " Lin told the CNA at the airport.</P>
      <P>Lin and Yen plan to travel the world on bicycles from April 2010 to October
2012. During the 30 months, they will cycle across Southeast Asia, Oceania,
Central Asia and Europe before flying across the Atlantic Ocean to the United
States and then Japan, the final stop.</P>
      <P>Lin, who worked at the technical department of the renowned Taiwanese dance
troupe Cloud Gate together with Yen before the two quit their jobs, said this
has been a dream of his since he read about the story of Hu Jung-hua, the first
Taiwanese to cycle around the world in the 1980s, and was greatly inspired.</P>
      <P>Interestingly, he said, a coincidence made the trip happen.</P>
      <P>"My landlord told us a couple of months ago that we had to move out because he
had decided to sell his apartment. I thought about taking a break from work
before coming up with the idea to turn the break into a cycling tour around the
world, " Lin said.</P>
      <P>He thought the year 2010 would be a good time to make the trip because
preparations are beginning this year to celebrate the ROC's centenary next year
and cycling is a good way to promote awareness of climate change and alternative
energy.</P>
      <P>Yen joined without hesitation although she had no previous cycling experience.
Lin has been a long-time cyclist and cycled across Australia in 1996. Yen said
all she wanted was to go out and see the world and cycling is one of the options
of transportation.</P>
      <P>Yen and Lin said they would like to dedicate the trip to the Republic of China
(Taiwan) , which was established in 1911, as a birthday present to the country.</P>
      <P>"I guess we'll be somewhere in Australia on January 1, 2011 to celebrate the
first day of the centenary. And maybe we can get married on October 10, ROC's
National Day somewhere in Europe, " she joked.</P>
      <P>Lin drew up the travel itinerary after consulting with a senior cyclist, who
advised them which countries to avoid and which countries would be good places
to cycle in.</P>
      <P>Lin half-jokingly said Wednesday that he was still struggling with whether to
make the trip, but also noted that the most important factor of the long trip is
not stamina, but determination.</P>
      <P>The pair will cycle between 60 to 120 kilometers on average each day, Lin said.</P>
      <P>With a budget of around NT$2 million (approximately US$63,400) , Lin said, the
trip would not be possible without the sponsorship of several local bicycle
companies, which provided them with bicycles priced at NT$200,000 each, and the
assistance of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which asked Taiwan's foreign
offices to provide help.</P>
      <P>Cloud Gate founder Lin Hwai-min also encouraged the couple to make the trip with
a donation of NT$100,000.</P>
      <P>"Mr. Lin jokingly told me that I would have to pay him the money back if I drop
out of the trip, " Lin said.</P>
      <P>A certified historical sites guide in Taiwan, Lin said he believes that he will
be able to share Taiwan's stories with foreigners and "show Taiwan to the world"
during his trip.</P>
      <P>"And about 90 percent of our equipment are Taiwan-made. We would like to tell
people these products are very well-made in Taiwan, " he said.</P>
      <P>Cycling is an ideal way of travel, which is faster than walking and slower than
driving cars, Lin said, adding that it also makes connecting and communicating
with local people possible.</P>
      <P>Looking ahead to the trip, Yen said that the place she would like to visit the
most is Lijiang in the southern China's Yunnan province, because of the
difficulty of the route, which is 2,800-3,000 meters above sea level.</P>
      <P>However, Lin acknowledged that it is very much possible that the trip will turn
out differently than it was originally planned due to weather conditions,
accidents and the situations in different countries.</P>
      <P>"We might have to change our plan along the way, " he said.</P>
      <P>But no matter how the world tour turns out, the couple said they plan to
document their dream trip every step of the way by taking photographs and
shooting videos. They also plan to regularly update their blogs and Facebook fan
pages to keep in touch with friends.</P>
      <P>Lin and Yen are scheduled to kick start the 2,100-kilometer first leg of the
two-and-a-half-year trip from Thailand to Malaysia and Singapore from April
7-28.</P>
      <P>After that, they will travel to Australia and New Zealand as well as make stops
in China, Kazakhstan, Russia, and Belarus before entering eastern and central
Europe in the second half of 2011.</P>

      <P>There have been two overseas-acquired cases of measles in Taiwan since the start
of this year, and both patients were from Kaohsiung in southern Taiwan,
government agencies reported Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The two patients, who were infected in a Southeast Asian country, have both
recovered, the county's health bureau said.</P>
      <P>Another case of German measles was also found in Kaohsiung County in late
February and the patient has also recovered, local health officials said, urging
the public to be careful when traveling to China or Southeast Asian countries.</P>
      <P>The Center for Disease Control (CDC) under the Cabinet-level Department of
Health on Wednesday confirmed the imported cases of measles.</P>
      <P>The individuals are a 26-year-old Vietnamese woman residing in Kaohsiung County
and her 15-month-old  baby girl,  CDC deputy director-general Lin Ting said.</P>
      <P>The woman, who is married to a Taiwanese man, and her child were found to have
contracted the infectious disease in Vietnam in late March. They developed
fever, rashes and Koplik spots -- symptoms of measles -- more than a week ago,
and are receiving treatment at a hospital, Lin said. Neither the woman nor her
baby have inoculation records, he added.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, no one else in the home has so far developed any symptoms of
measles, but they are being closely monitored by health authorities.</P>
      <P>In the last three years, a total of 19 cases of overseas-acquired measles --
nine from Vietnam, seven from China, and one each from India, Japan and Thailand
-- have been found in Taiwan, Lin reported.</P>
      <P>He urged that the public, especially children, get vaccinated against the
disease.</P>

      <P>The Dr. Cecilia Koo Botanic Conservation Center (KBCC) in southern Taiwan has
successfully collected 13,091 tropical plant species, which makes the center the
largest of its kind in Asia in terms of varieties, academic sources said Monday.</P>
      <P>Named after the mother of Koo Cheng-yun, who is the chairman of Taiwan Cement
Corp. and sponsor of the center, the KBCC has eight greenhouses spread over five
acres of the Koo family's farm in Gaoshu township in Taiwan's southernmost
county of Pingtung.</P>
      <P>With the support of the National Science Council (NSC) , the center is expected
to expand its germplasm collection of tropical and subtropical plant strains and
varieties to 30,000 within the next 15 years to become one of the top plant
centers in the world.</P>
      <P>The center's collection  of some plant families,  such as Orchidaceae (orchid
family), Bromeliaceae and Begoniaceae (pineapple family) and Pteridophyta or
fern species, already ranks among the best in the world.</P>
      <P>Li Chia-wei, a National Tsing Hua University biology professor who heads the
conservation center, said the world now has about 300,000 plant species, half of
which thrive in tropical areas.</P>
      <P>However, many species face the threat of extinction because of habitat
destruction and environmental degradation, Li said. An estimated two-thirds of
the plant species may disappear from the planet by the end of this century if
special efforts are not made to protect and conserve them, he added.</P>
      <P>In an effort to rescue plant species and maintain biodiversity, Li said, the NSC
and the KBCC are collaborating to collect and nurture tropical and subtropical
botanical strains and varieties.</P>
      <P>To date, the conservatory has collected 13,091 tropical plant species in 14
families,  including  Orchidaceae,  Bromeliaceae, Zingiberaceae, Marantaceae,
Musaceae and Pteridophyta.</P>
      <P>According to Li, the center has outstripped the Xishuangbanna Tropical Botanical
Garden in China's Yunnan Province to become Asia's largest conservation center
of tropical tree genetic resources.</P>
      <P>Founded in January 2008, the center has since collected and cultivated 6,057
orchid strains, surpassing the botanical gardens in New York City, Missouri,
Singapore and Indonesia to become the world's largest orchid species
conservation center.</P>
      <P>The landmark conservatory is now open only to scholars and experts for research
purposes. In the past couple of years, it has attracted many world-renowned
academics in the field. The public will have a chance to view certain  rare
plant species  from the conservatory at the Taipei International Flora Expo,
which is scheduled to open in Nov. 6, Li said.</P>

      <P>Shanghai Mayor Han Zheng had a casual afternoon Wednesday on the second day of
his brief visit to Taiwan, touring the National Palace Museum, riding the Taipei
Mass Rapid Transit (MRT), and window shopping at Taipei 101.</P>
      <P>Despite his tight schedule of intensive meetings with politicians and business
leaders and promoting World Expo Shanghai, Han took an afternoon to experience
the leisure time of many Taipei nine-to-five workers.</P>
      <P>After a busy morning that included a breakfast meeting between Taiwanese and
Shanghai businessmen at 8: 00 a.m. and an investment climate briefing for the
Shanghai visitors by the Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA), Han
and his entourage were hosted for lunch by Chiang Pin-kung, chairman of the
Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF).</P>
      <P>Han arrived in Taipei Tuesday for a four-day visit. Most of his itinerary is
business-related, but he has been able to spend some time at the National Palace
Museum and the Taipei 101 skyscraper, which are at top of the sightseeing agenda
for most Chinese visitors to Taipei, and visit other sights in the city.</P>
      <P>While the mayor from Shanghai might have found the encounter with the large
crowds at a night market in downtown Taipei Tuesday evening merely an
interesting experience, he was impressed by the Taipei MRT and said that
Shanghai could learn from Taipei in terms of MRT management.</P>
      <P>Passengers at the MRT Beitou station were surprised to see the mayor of
Shanghai, who has been in the TV news headlines for the past few days, on a
subway train at rush hour.</P>
      <P>At the National Palace Museum, Han was also recognized by many Chinese tourists
who tried to get near him, and he was therefore not able to get a good look at
the museum's many cultural treasures as he was forced to cut shout his visit
there.</P>
      <P>His visit to the Beitou incinerator, accompanied by Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin,
was part of his semi-official itinerary. Han learned about Taipei City
Government's garbage management and heard from Mayor Hau how the city government
managed to reduce the amount of waste by establishing a recycling system and by
stipulating that only garbage placed in city government issued bags would be
picked up.</P>

which was achieved after the 2008 presidential election in Taiwan, some American
scholars suggested Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Dr. Douglas Paal, former director of the American Institute in Taiwan, Taipei
office, said in a Taipei-New York video conference Wednesday evening (Taipei
time) that "beyond the merits of economic expansion after a global economic
crisis and of detente in an area of long-term hostility, the ECFA promises to
bring Taiwan greater economic and political stability in the region and globe."</P>
      <P>Paal, who is now vice president of the Washington, D.C.-based think tank
Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, commented that the attempt to
frighten Taiwan's traditional economic sectors with threats of cheap and
dangerous Chinese goods swamping their markets is a "familiar phenomenon among
protectionist forces."</P>
      <P>Daniel Rosen, visiting fellow at the Peterson Institute for International
Economics in New York, suggested that "the ECFA does not amount to an economic
development strategy but only achieving a 'level playing field' with competitors
in the region."</P>
      <P>"Taiwan needs to think beyond ECFA to the much harder question of how to
maintain its comparative advantages," he said.</P>
      <P>The video conference, co-chaired by Dr. Lin Bih-jaw of National Chengchi
University in Taipei and William Holstein, president of the Overseas Press Club
of American Foundation in New York, was attended by members of the press club
and scholars from think tanks in New York and Washington and scholars from
universities and research institutes in Taiwan.</P>

    <DATELINE>04/08/10  10:51:48
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Beijing's Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference resolved to push
for a framework of peaceful development of links with Taiwan this year.</P>
      <P>Beijing's idea of one China has undergone a subtle change recently. It has
transformed from denying the existence of the Republic of China to not denying
the existence of the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>Chinese President Hu Jintao said: "Although Taiwan and the Chinese mainland have
not been unified since 1949, this doesn't change the fact that they both belong
to China... This is not only our stance but is also provided in Taiwan's
documents."</P>
      <P>His remarks indicated that Beijing has changed its claim that "the People's
Republic of China is the sole legitimate regime of China" to simply "sticking to
the one China principle."</P>
      <P>Beijing has been trying to deal with Taiwan in the same way it did with Hong
Kong, Macau, Xinjiang and Tibet, without realizing that unlike the others,
Taiwan has a popularly elected president and Beijing should deal with all of the
people on the island rather than any political party.</P>
      <P>Only if Beijing admits the existence of the Republic of China can it draw up a
pragmatic framework for peaceful development of links with Taiwan. (April 8,

    <HEADLINE>Commercial Times: Inconvenient fiscal truths</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>04/08/10  11:42:17
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Finance Lee Sush-der has recently drawn wide-ranging criticism for
his improper remarks. In one incident, he contended that "the Republic of China
has the best finances" in the world, dismissing the belief that government
finances are worsening as a "mistaken notion."</P>
      <P>Lee argued that the government's fiscal deficit has stemmed from the capital
budget and that there is surplus on the current budget every year. He also said
that the debt levels and flows of the government have not violated the ceiling
stipulated in the Public Debt Act.</P>
      <P>However, we must point out that a correct assessment should derive from
professional knowledge and training, not from evasion and the concealment of
truths.</P>
      <P>First, if what the minister said is correct, why has every prominent
international credit rating agency downgraded Taiwan's sovereign credit rating
in recent years?</P>
      <P>Second, if what the minister said is correct, then Taiwan has never suffered
from a budget deficit since the Budget Act was in place, because the law
stipulates that the government's current revenue must be higher than current
expenditure.</P>
      <P>Lee's budget notions are mainly based on corporate finance, which believes that
debts incurred for capital investment do not worsen a company's fiscal status,
because there has not been any change to its "net worth."</P>
      <P>However, unlike investment projects by private businesses, public construction
projects are not "self-liquidating." Thus, government should be more careful and
conservative about its finances than private businesses. As the country's
financier, Lee should know these economic concepts.</P>
      <P>His claim that government debt has not exceeded the legal limit is even more
unacceptable to the well-informed.</P>
      <P>The fact that government finances have not broken the law does not mean there is
no problem or crisis. Furthermore, the government has accumulated hundreds of
billions in debt that "according to law" are excluded from the calculation of
the debt ceiling. (April 8, 2010)</P>

04/08/10  12:22:32
(By S. F. Wang and Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei-based China Airlines (CAL) announced Wednesday that it will slash about
20 percent from ticket prices for non-stop flights from Taiwan to four popular
destinations in China.</P>
      <P>According to Taiwan's largest carrier, it will cut ticket prices on flights from
Taiwan's Taoyuan and Kaohsiung airports to airports in China's Shanghai,
Beijing, Guangzhou and Shenzhen.</P>
      <P>Tickets for 26 weekly cross-Taiwan Strait economy flights on or after April 16
will be affected.</P>
      <P>Tickets on the Taipei-Shanghai route will fall to NT$15,410 (US$487.66) from
NT$19,100, while the price for a Taipei-Beijing flight will be cut to NT$15,000
from NT$18,600, according to the company.</P>
      <P>The CAL attributed its decision to lower the flight ticket prices to Q1 profits
due to a recovering global economy. "We hoped to pay back our customers, " a CAL
executive said, stressing that this is an "instituted" measure, rather than an
interim practice.</P>
      <P>Other Taipei-based airlines, such as Trans Asia Airways and EVA Airways,
meanwhile, said later the same day they will assess the possibility of following
suit and could come out with a decision Thursday.</P>
      <P>The CAL's initiative to cut the prices came after Lee Long-wen, director-general
of the Civil Aeronautics Administration, demanded at a public hearing in the
Legislative Yuan Tuesday that airlines "show some conscience" in the face of
high air travel prices.</P>
      <P>Attending Taiwan businessmen voiced anger about the issue, arguing that the
benefits of direct cross-strait flights should be shared among all Taiwanese
people, not just aviation companies.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Talk of the day -- China Airlines leads rate cuts</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>04/08/10  12:26:33
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's largest airline company, China Airlines, announced unexpectedly
Wednesday a whopping 20-percent cut in rates for direct flights between Taiwan
and four major Chinese cities including Shanghai, pressing other carriers to
follow suit.</P>
      <P>The rate cuts were the result of customer complaints  of unreasonably high
rates, legislators' criticism and pressure from the Civil Aeronautics
Administration (CAA) . They were also seen as a far-sighted  scheme
anticipating  increased  need  for  direct cross-strait flights and soaring
demands to and from Shanghai in particular as the 2010 World Expo will be
kicking off in May.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from local media coverage of the issue:</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>One day after CAA Director-General Lee Long-wen bashed Taiwan's airline carriers
for hoarding seats and tickets and told them to "show some conscience, " China
Airlines took the initiative in reducing the rates for economy seat tickets.
Round-trip tickets between Taipei and Shanghai will drop from NT$19,100 (US$602)
to NT$15,400, while Taipei-Beijing tickets will fall from NT$18,600 to
NT$15,000.</P>
      <P>The deepest price-cut to date was nevertheless considered by many Taiwanese
citizens maintaining business operations in China who fly across the strait
frequently as "belated justice." "Not as sweet as expected, but it serves as a
good start anyway," some said. (April 8, 2010).</P>
      <P>Economic Daily News:</P>
      <P>EVA Airways and Trans Asia Airways were forced to meet China Airline's lower
rates. The rate cuts will result in financial losses for the Taiwanese carriers
in the short run, but are also seen to increase  their bargaining  chances  for
increased  numbers of cross-strait flights and extra flights for special dates.</P>
      <P>The next round of cross-strait air transportation negotiations are scheduled to
take place in Taipei this month.</P>
      <P>Yao Ta-kuang, chairman of the Travel Agent Association of Taiwan (TAAT) , said
that unless the number of direct cross-strait flights doubles, the lower rates
would not help. He suggested cross-strait negotiators increase the number of
such flights from the current 270 per week to 405 to meet actual needs. (April
8, 2010).</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>CAA Director-General Lee Long-wen said Wednesday he was pleased with China
Airlines' plan to cut rates for economy tickets for cross-strait flights
beginning from April 16. "I think that the Chinese airline companies plying the
cross-strait routes will do the same before long," Lee said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's travel agents, however, were lukewarm about the lower prices. They said
the reduced tickets were still higher than prices at the beginning of the year.
For example, they said, the price for an economy seat on a direct Taipei-
Shanghai round-trip flight increased by NT$4,000 over the past three months --
compared with the NT$3,700 cut introduced by China Airlines. (April 8, 2010).</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan is still working on an "early harvest" list for concessionary tariff
treatment under a proposed economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) with
China, the country's top China policy planner said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairwoman Lai Shin-yuan made the remarks at the
Legislative Yuan's committee on internal affairs while briefing lawmakers on the
recent second round of ECFA talks across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) legislators
criticized the administration of President Ma Ying-jeou for what they called a
lack of transparency in dealing with the negotiations.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Lai Ching-te accused the administration of looking down on the
legislature as it has so far not presented the draft text of the agreement and
the related "early harvest" list for screening.</P>
      <P>In response, Lai said that during the March 31-April 1 ECFA talks in Taiwan,
Chinese negotiators did not produce any "wish list" of goods and services for
immediate tariff concessions or reductions that could form the backbone of an
ECFA, seen as a scaled-down free trade agreement.</P>
      <P>Likewise, Lai said, Taiwan did not unveil any "early harvest" list at the talks
because the content is still in the works.</P>
      <P>"It would put Taiwan at a disadvantage if we unilaterally revealed our 'early
harvest' list at this moment, " Lai told lawmakers.</P>
      <P>Huang Chih-peng, director-general of the Bureau of Foreign Trade under the
Ministry of Economic Affairs who led the Taiwanese delegation at the second
round of ECFA talks, was also present at the legislative meeting.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Empty rhetoric, bluffs and lies were abound when President Ma Ying-jeou
discussed his policy in a recent video conference with Harvard University
faculty and students.</P>
      <P>Obviously, Ma was attempting to win international support to try to reverse the
decline in his approval ratings. However, since Ma has failed to convince his
own people,  how could he fool those well-trained foreign experts?</P>
      <P>In terms of economy, Ma told the Harvard audience that his administration has
successfully led Taiwan out of the latest economic downturn. But the fact is
that even if Taiwan achieves 4.72 percent economic growth this year as projected
by Ma, the performance would still be the worst among the "four little dragons"
in Asia. The unemployment rate of 5.7 percent recorded in February, meanwhile,
is the highest among the four.</P>
      <P>Ma also said that "agreeing to disagree on 'one China'" has been a principle of
his China policy. However, over the past two years, we have only seen Ma fawn
over Beijing and honor the People's Republic of China as the legitimate heir of
"one China." He has seldom dared to show any hint of "agreeing to disagree."</P>
      <P>On the proposed economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) with China, Ma
said that only by signing the trade pact will Taiwan prevent itself from being
marginalized and increase the likelihood of forging similar agreements with
other countries. The fact is: Begging for China's patronage to help Taiwan seal
free trade agreements with other countries is as foolish as hoping the sun will
rise in the west. (April 8, 2010)</P>

      <P>Braving gusty winds of 45 kilometers per hour and temperatures of minus 20
degrees Celsius, Taiwanese runner Chen Yen-po finished third in the 2010 North
Pole Marathon Thursday after the competition was briefly suspended for severe
weather conditions.</P>
      <P>Chen completed the 42.195-kilometer route in five hours, 29 minutes and 47
seconds to place third among 26 runners from 10 countries in the competition
dubbed "the world's coolest marathon."</P>
      <P>Chen's mother told CNA by telephone that what she cared about most was Chen's
safety, but she was happy to know her son had finished in the top three.</P>
      <P>Joep Rozendal from the Netherlands won the men's event in five hours and 58
seconds while Emer Dooley from Ireland took first place in the women's race.</P>
      <P>Chen, a 23-year-old graduate student from National Taiwan Sports University,
surpassed the top-10 goal he made before the competition.</P>
      <P>The competitors arrived at the Norwegian town of Longyearbyen on Spitsbergen
island off the coast of Norway April 5. They were flown to an international
North Pole Camp called Barneo for the race.</P>
      <P>Chen is no stranger of running in extreme conditions, having finishing third in
the 600-kilometer Polar Challenge race in 2008 and fourth in the 2009 Himalayan
100-Mile Stage Race.</P>
      <P>The circuit of 42.195 kilometers meanders among hillocks of ice and incorporates
part of an aircraft runway. Participants have to have the nerve and drive to run
on Arctic ice floes only six to 12 feet above 12,000 feet of Arctic Ocean.</P>
      <P>According to Chen's mother, Chen told her by satellite telephone at 5 p.m.
Wednesday local time that the race had been postponed due to a severe storm.</P>

Guest House, during which Aso was quoted as having praised Ma's modus vivendi
approach toward relations across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Aso was said have expressed admiration for Ma's efforts to improve cross-strait
relations and normalize bilateral trade and economic ties.</P>
      <P>He also said that security cooperation between Japan and the United States is
crucial to Asia-Pacific stability and prosperity, a view that Ma supported
fully, diplomatic sources said.</P>
      <P>Several senior Taiwanese officials, including Minister of Foreign Affairs
Timothy Yang and National Security Council Secretary-General Hu Wei-chen, were
also present at the luncheon.</P>
      <P>This was Aso's first trip to Taiwan since he stepped down as Japanese prime
minister in September 2009.</P>
      <P>He last visited Taiwan in April 2003 in his capacity as head of the then-ruling
Liberal Democratic Party's policy coordination council.</P>
      <P>Only two other retired Japanese prime ministers have visited Taiwan. Takeo
Fukuda visited in March 1992 and Yoshiro Mori visited in both December 2003 and
November 2006.</P>

      <P>About half of the local population will have to pay more once a second-
generation national health insurance system is put in place, Department of
Health (DOH) Minister Yaung Chih-liang said Thursday.</P>
      <P>In contrast, Yaung said, the other half of the population will see a decline in
their health insurance premiums.</P>
      <P>The new system will calculate insurance premiums based on the insured's overall
household incomes, including stock dividends, instead of solely on their earned
income as is the case under the current system.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Yaung said, the new system will have single people pay more than those

      <P>Hong Kong and Taiwan will discuss air links through two intermediary councils
that have recently been established by the two sides, a source said Thursday.</P>
      <P>David Lie, a vice chairman of the Hong Kong-Taiwan Economic and Cultural
Cooperation and Promotion Council, said during an interview with Radio
Television Hong Kong that the council will soon engage in talks with its
Taiwanese counterpart -- the Taiwan-Hong Kong Economic and Cultural Cooperation
and Promotion Council -- to work out an MOU on air transport exchanges between
the two sides.</P>
      <P>The existing Hong Kong-Taiwan aviation pact expires at the end of June.</P>
      <P>Talks about air links between  Hong Kong and Taiwan have previously been held by
representatives of the airline business sectors from the two sides. The Taiwan
airline carriers, however, were not completely satisfied with the pact, Lie
said.</P>
      <P>"This year's MOU on Hong Kong-Taiwan air exchanges is expected to be signed by
the two newly established  councils  --  a new communication platform between
the two sides," Lie said.</P>
      <P>Lie also chairs the newly established Hong Kong-Taiwan Business Cooperation
Committee, which is comprised of members of Hong Kong's commerce and industry
sector.</P>
      <P>The Hong Kong-Taiwan Economic and Cultural Cooperation and Promotion Council was
set up April 1 by the government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
as an intermediary body in the absence of official ties between Hong Kong and
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan-Hong Kong Economic and Cultural Cooperation and Promotion Council is
being established under the supervision of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs
Department under the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council.</P>
      <P>The two councils will work to facilitate broader and deeper exchange between the
two sides. Possible areas of cooperation include public health, financial
regulation and supervision, avoidance of double  taxation,  tourism,  culture,
sports  and  document authentication, according to the Hong Kong government.</P>
      <P>It is hoped that the councils will help tackle matters of mutual concern,
including simplicility in taxation regulations and financial cooperation, to
create mutually beneficial business opportunities, Lie said.</P>
      <P>"It is keenly hoped that Hong Kong-Taiwan business and trade exchanges will not
be compromised as a result of closer cross-Taiwan Strait ties," he added.</P>

      <P>Visiting Shanghai Mayor Han Zheng paid a courtesy call Thursday on Cecilia Y.
Koo, wife of the late Koo Chen-fu, Taiwan's former top negotiator with China,
who died in 2005.</P>
      <P>Koo extended a warm welcome to Han during the meeting held at the Cheng Hsin
Rehabilitation Medical Center in suburban Taipei.</P>
      <P>She told Han that he reminded her of the common wish of her late husband and of
Wang Daohan,  the late president of Beijing's Association for Relations Across
the Taiwan Straits -- peace across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Wang also formerly served as secretary of the Communist Party of China's
Shanghai Municipal Committee and as Shanghai mayor.</P>
      <P>Koo and Wang were the first two cross-strait officials to start ice-breaking
cross-strait dialogue after an impasse of five decades since 1949. Koo visited
Shanghai for an SEF-ARATS meeting, but Wang never visited Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"Your visit here convinces me that the prospects for peace across the strait are
getting increasingly brighter," Koo told Han.</P>
      <P>Koo,  in her capacity  as chairwoman  of the Cheng  Hsin Rehabilitation Medical
Center, accompanied Han on a brief tour of the hospital established by Madame
Chiang Kai-shek in 1967.</P>
      <P>In return, Han made a donation of 1.5 million Chinese yuan (US$219,700) to the
hospital for the treatment and rehabilitation of children suffering from hearing
impairment.</P>
      <P>The hospital was the final stop on the itinerary of Han and his entourage in
Taipei City since their arrival two days earlier.</P>
      <P>Han, who had a tight schedule of meetings with Taiwanese politicians and
business leaders to promote the 2010 World Expo Shanghai during his four-day
visit, later proceeded to Taipei County on a whirlwind visit.</P>
      <P>Taipei Magistrate Chou Hsi-wei hosted a lunch in honor of Han and his delegation
at a beach-side restaurant in Wanli township.</P>
      <P>After the lunch, they visited the nearby Yeliou Geopark to see the locally
renowned "Queen's Head, " one of several rock formations that dot the Yeliou
Cape, located on the north coast of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Han also presented 200 tickets to the expo to Chou, who has visited Shanghai and
had met with Han twice before.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Chen Tain-jy, a professor at National Taiwan University and former minister of
the Council for Economic Planning and Development, said at a seminar that
Taiwan's proposed trade pact with China will normalize cross-strait economic
relations.</P>
      <P>In the video conference organized by the Government Information Office and held
at 1230 GMT Wednesday in Taipei and New York simultaneously, Chen said an
economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) would provide a platform for
Taiwan and China to resolve all their bilateral trade issues under the World
Trade Organization framework.</P>
      <P>For Taiwan firms, the pact will convert China from an offshore export processing
zone into an attractive market, he said.</P>
      <P>This is very important in light of the fact that China is losing its luster as a
global processing zone because of rising labor costs and a policy shift toward
domestic market development, Chen said.</P>
      <P>In addition to providing a level playing field for Taiwan businesspeople in
China, Chen said the pact will open up new chances for them to cooperate with
their Chinese counterparts.</P>
      <P>"This will allow the two sides to pool their technologies and know-how for
industrial applications," he said.</P>
      <P>"When free trade is achieved across the Strait, Taiwan will become a nice
gateway to China for multinational firms," Chen added.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's vicinity to China enables multinational firms based in Taiwan to better
serve their Chinese customers along the coast than their competitors located
within China, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan offers free access to information, almost unlimited support of financial
credits,  and free flow of personnel -- services that are not available in
China, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Two other local scholars also spoke at the teleconference: Lin Bih-jaw, vice
president of Taipei's National Chengchi University; and S. Philip Hsu, executive
director of the Center for China Studies at National Taiwan University.</P>
      <P>They exchanged views with William Holstein, president of the Overseas Press Club
Foundation; Douglas Paal, vice president of the Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace;  and Daniel Rosen, visiting fellow at Peterson Institute
for International Economics.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou's administration is working hard to conclude the pact
with China in June, but has had difficulty selling it to the opposition parties,
which are worried that the pact will undermine Taiwan's sovereignty.</P>
      <P>The seminar is part of the Government Information Office's efforts to muster
support for the pact.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Thursday his administration  has been actively
promoting  the signing of a wide-reaching trade pact with China to help upgrade
Taiwan's national competitiveness through participation in regional integration.</P>
      <P>Such efforts, however, have met strong objection from the opposition camp, led
by the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), as it worries that the proposed
economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) may lead to Taiwan's
overreliance on the Chinese market, Ma said while meeting with Michael Porter, a
leading authority in corporate strategy.</P>
      <P>According to a Presidential Office official present at the meeting, Ma briefed
the visiting American management guru on the strategic and economic significance
to Taiwan of the proposed cross-Taiwan Strait ECFA, seen as a scaled-back free
trade agreement.</P>
      <P>After listening to Ma's briefing, Porter expressed support for the ECFA
initiative and endorsed Ma's views on the pact's value to Taiwan, the official
said.</P>
      <P>During their meeting, Ma also outlined strategies "with Taiwanese
characteristics" to accelerate the country's economic recovery that will
contribute to Taiwan's goals of achieving high job growth, industrial
innovation, energy conservation and carbon reduction, as well as participation
in regional economic integration.</P>
      <P>As the two sides of the Taiwan Strait are still in talks on the pact, Ma
solicited Porter's opinions on whether his administration's present strategy can
effectively help upgrade Taiwan's competitive edge and which aspects could be
improved or amended, the official said.</P>
      <P>Porter was scheduled to deliver a speech later Thursday in which he was expected
to emphasize the importance of regional integration to economic development and
to present his views on the challenges that Taiwan may face this year and how
the country can create a win-win scenario in the development of cross-strait
relations, the official said.</P>

      <P>A video of local KTV singer Lin Yu-chun singing Whitney Houston's hit song "I
Will Always Love You" was spreading fast across the Internet Thursday, winning
him a reputation as "Taiwan's Susan Boyle."</P>
      <P>The performance by the 24-year-old on local talent show "Million Star" was first
posted on YouTube two days ago and has since "rolled around the world" on the
Web.</P>
      <P>According to an article published on Yahoo! TV Blog, the video already has had
over 150,000 views, and searches for "Lin Yu-chun" had gone up over 200 percent
in the previous 24 hours.</P>
      <P>Lin's rendition is "a near-perfect  sound-alike of Whitney Houston's original,
with barely a hint of an accent, " the author commented,  predicting  that Lin
will become an "international sensation" and be invited to that holiest-of-
holies for this type of performer -- a slot on an American TV morning show.</P>
      <P>"Even if singing competitions are not your thing, you have to admire the
technical prowess that the baby-faced, bowl-cut-wearing Lin displays: How often
can a male of any age sound exactly like a female pop star singing one of the
most demanding songs in the karaoke catalog?" the author asked.</P>
      <P>There have been immediate comparisons between Lin and Susan Boyle, a British KTV
singer who rose to stardom after auditioning for "Britain's Got Talent" last
year.</P>
      <P>The Sun online, a British tabloid, introduced Lin as "the next SuBo on Taiwan
show, " saying that he is "threatening to steal Susan Boyle's crown as this
year's most unexpected musical superstar."</P>
      <P>The Mail Online, another British tabloid, said that "Susan Boyle needs to look
out -- there's another YouTube singing sensation shooting up the popularity
charts."</P>
      <P>Some, however, were critical about his looks.</P>

      <P>Phasing out the death penalty is the government's ultimate goal, but the
executions of 44 death row inmates will be carried out in accordance with the
law, Justice Minister Tseng Yung-fu said Thursday.</P>
      <P>A task force will be formed by the Ministry of Justice to determine the order of
the executions once all avenues for appeal have been exhausted, although so far
there is no timetable for any of the executions, Tseng said during a Legislative
Yuan session.</P>
      <P>"The prosecutors are authorized to recommend death sentences based on their
duties and professional judgment, although they are also required to be extra
careful when they make decisions, " Tseng said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, he went on, the Ministry of Justice will sponsor a number of public
hearings around the country beginning mid-April on the issue of whether the
death penalty should be abolished once and for all.</P>
      <P>On a decision by the Nantou District Prosecutors Office to seek three death
sentences for Lin Yu-ju for murdering her mother, husband and mother-in-law,
Tseng said he respects the prosecutors' decision.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has not carried out a death sentence since late 2005.</P>
      <P>It was the first time Tseng had appeared at a question-and-answer session at the
Legislative Yuan since taking office last month.</P>
      <P>Controversy over the death penalty issue resurged after Wang Ching-feng, Tseng's
predecessor, made clear her support of the abolition of the death penalty and
refused to sign off on outstanding execution orders.</P>
      <P>Wang's decision sparked outrage among the families of the victims and in society
in general, which prompted her to resign from her post in March.</P>
      <P>Tseng has said he has no problem signing execution orders once all the required
procedures have been completed.</P>

      <P>Tseng Wen-ting was named the Most Valuable player of Taiwan's Super Basketball
League (SBL) for the months of February and March, the league announced
Thursday.</P>
      <P>A media poll awarded the honor to Tseng, a 204-centimeter center, after he led
the Yulon Luxgens to a 10-game winning streak in March as they regained momentum
after the Lunar New Year break. Tseng averaged 13.1 points, 9.1 rebounds, 1.93
steals and 2.3 blocked shots during the month.</P>
      <P>"It's a big surprise. I guess I got this award because we did pretty well after
the New Year break," the 26-year-old said.</P>
      <P>Yulon, a perennial powerhouse in Taiwanese basketball that has won three SBL
titles in the league's seven-year history, suffered the first four-game losing
streak in team history around the New Year vacation. But now they have a record
of 17 wins and five losses, one game behind the league-leading Dacin Tigers.</P>
      <P>The season has been especially difficult for Tseng because Yulon is the only
team in the seven-team league that did not hire foreign players after the SBL
decided for the first time this year to allow all of its teams to hire imports
to improve the level of competition.</P>
      <P>The decision left Tseng the undesirable task of having to defend against taller
and stronger foreign players. Injuries to both of his knees made the challenge
even more difficult, but Tseng played through and didn't complain about not
getting enough support from the bench players.</P>
      <P>"It's not a surprise at all for me because when you look at him (Tseng), you
can't just look at the numbers. He has been contributing to the team in a lot of
ways and he always plays his heart out and gives 100 percent on the court, "
said Yulon head coach Zhang Xu-lei, a naturalized Taiwan citizen who formerly
played for the Chinese national team.</P>
      <P>Tseng, a Taiwan national team regular, said his goal for the season would first
be making the post-season and then hopefully returning to the championship
series in June.</P>

      <P>The exhibit will open from April 10 until May 9 and is one of the cooperation

Beijing.</P>
      <P>Fan Di'an, the director of the Beijing museum and also the organizer of the
exhibit titled "The Moment of the LandscapeVOil Paintings by Contemporary
Chinese Masters", has invited the artists to show 56 compelling works in Taipei.</P>
      <P>In addition, these artists, including Dai Shi-he, Li Yan-zhou, Wang Ke-ju, Wang

to depict famous tourist spots in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The result of their works in Taiwan will be displayed later in the same exhibit.</P>
      <P>Fan said the reason for focusing on the theme of "landscape paintings" is
because Chinese artists have developed innovative approaches in recent years to
painting landscapes, which do not limit them to landscape, but also allow them
to exhibit their creativity and personal styles, according to the press release
issued by the TFAM.</P>
      <P>Fan will come to Taipei on April 21 for the upcoming opening of the exhibit on

    <HEADLINE>Wrangle over ECFA debate between government and DPP</HEADLINE>

      <P>The Presidnetial Office and the main opposition Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) argued Thursday about conditions over a planned debate between President
Ma Ying-jeou and DPP Chairwoman  Tsai Ing-wen on whether Taiwan should sign a
controversial trade pact with China.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a news conference at the Presidential Office, Presidential Spokesman
Lo Chih-chiang demanded that Tsai, prior to the April 25 debate with Ma, give a
list detailing what items and how many items should be included in Taiwan's list
of items to enjoy priority tariff cuts, known as an "early harvest list."</P>
      <P>The list of items would be the first to enjoy tariff cuts once Taiwan and China
sign the economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA), which the two sides
hope to by June.</P>
      <P>Since the DPP is strongly opposed to Taiwan signing the deal with China, Tsai
should come up with an alternative on how to help Taiwan break through the
increased regional economic integration that Taiwan has been excluded from, Lo
said.</P>
      <P>If Tsai contends that not a single item should be named in the early harvest
list to ask for a tariff-exemption treatment from China, she should also provide
an explanation, Lo insisted.</P>
      <P>If Tsai has no ideas on how to help Taiwan face the pressure it will face once
other countries sign free-trade agreements with China and enjoy zero-tariff
privileges for their exports, then Tsai should make it clear to the public, Lo
said.</P>
      <P>Lo also insisted that the DPP chairwoman make public her assessment of the
situation to explain why she objects to the planned ECFA.</P>
      <P>The two parties reached agreement Wednesday to organize a 2-hour and 20-minute
Ma-Tsai debate on the disputed ECFA on April 25. The debate will be the first
ever between the two parties' leaders since Ma was elected in 2008, ending eight
years of DPP control over the presidency.</P>
      <P>According to DPP spokesman Tsai Chi-chang, Tsai Ing-wen will explain her
alternative to the ECFA and other questions to Taiwan's people in the coming
televised debate.</P>
      <P>For its part, the DPP demanded late Wednesday that the KMT reveal the items on a
700-item "early harvest list" as well as relevant information and documents
reportedly put forth by China on the trade agreement.</P>
      <P>The DPP has warned that signing the agreement would cause a flood of cheaper
Chinese products to Taiwan and cause job losses for Taiwan's workers.</P>
      <P>But the government and KMT have argued that Taiwan's exports to China -- its
biggest export market -- would not be able to compete once China signs similar
agreements with other countries.</P>

      <P>Trans Asia, following in the footsteps of Taipei-based China Airlines (CAL) ,
announced Thursday that it will slash fares by 20 percent on its economy flights
from Taipei to Shanghai from April 16.</P>
      <P>The price cut will reduce the price of a round-trip Taipei- Shanghai flight from
NT$19,000 (US$602) to NT$15,200, according to a Trans Asia spokesperson.</P>
      <P>CAL, Taiwan's largest carrier, took the lead a day earlier when it announced
that it will slash about 20 percent from ticket prices for its non-stop economy
flights from Taoyuan and Kaohsiung to four popular destinations in China --
Shanghai, Beijing, Guangzhou and Shenzhen -- also from April 16.</P>
      <P>Under CAL's new pricing scheme, round-trip tickets on the Taipei-Shanghai route
will fall to NT$15,410 from NT$19,100, while the price for a two-way Taipei-
Beijing flight will be cut to NT$15,000 from NT$18,600.</P>
      <P>CAL attributed its decision to lower fares to Q1 profits due to the recovering
global economy and said it is a measure designed to give back to customers,
rather than just an interim practice.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  EVA Airways,  another major provider of direct cross-Taiwan Strait
flights, was tight-lipped about whether it will follow suit.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese businessmen  with operations  in China have long complained about the
high cost of direct cross-strait flights.</P>
      <P>At a public hearing at the Legislative Yuan Tuesday, Lee Lung-wen, director-
general of the Civil Aeronautics Administration, asked airlines to "show some
conscience" in the face of high air travel prices across the strait.</P>
      <P>"The benefits of direct cross-strait flights should be shared among all
Taiwanese people, not just the aviation companies, " he argued.</P>
      <P>Later Thursday, the Consumers' Foundation (CF) said it is meaningless to
arbitrarily cut the face value of ticket prices and that prices should reflect
travel time.</P>
      <P>Taking as an example the Taipei-Shanghai flight, which takes only around 80
minutes, the retail price for the customer should not be higher than NT$10,000,
CF Chairman Hsieh Tian-jen said.</P>
      <P>The Ministry  of Transportation  and Communications  should intervene  in the
pricing of cross-strait  flights to protect consumers' interests, especially
during specific holidays such as the Lunar New Year holiday and Tomb Sweeping
Day, he contended.</P>

    <HEADLINE>55%-60% of population to be unaffected by healthcare system changes</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 8 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Executive Yuan passed Thursday a draft package of amendments to the National
Health Insurance Act that, once it clears the legislative floor, will result in
higher premiums for about 45 percent of the population.</P>
      <P>Premier Wu Den-yi said after the approval of the package at an Executive Yuan
weekly meeting that he feels sorry that single people will have to pay higher
premiums under the proposed legal amendments that will pave the way for the
enforcement of a second-generation national health insurance system.</P>
      <P>"It is unlikely that the new program will satisfy everybody... I am sorry that
single people will have to pay higher premiums... The government has several
programs in place to help young people form their own families, " Wu said at a
news conference after the Executive Yuan meeting.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, Department of Health (DOH) Minister Yaung Chih-
liang said the new system's insurance premium rate will range between 3 percent
and 3.5 percent of the insured person's total income.</P>
      <P>"The premium rate will not be the previous 4.55 percent nor the current 5.17
percent... In my estimation, the rate is likely to be 3 percent to 3.5 percent,"
Yaung said.</P>
      <P>Unlike the present system, in which premiums are calculated based solely on the
insured's earned income, the new scheme will calculate premiums based on total
household income, including wages, stock dividends, rental income and other
unearned income.</P>
      <P>The broader income base is expected to help keep the healthcare system out of
the red, Yaung said, adding that the new scheme will be more equitable, as
wealthy households in which income does not mainly rely on earned income will
have to pay more, while the financial burden on single-income households and
those with many family members will be reduced.</P>
      <P>Citing a preliminary estimate by the DOH's Bureau of National Health Insurance
(BNHI), Yaung said that 50 percent to 60 percent of the population will see
their health insurance premiums being lowered or remaining unchanged.</P>
      <P>The one possible drawback of the new system will be that single people will end
up paying more, Yaung said.</P>
      <P>Under the present system, a family of four with a monthly income of NT$50,000
(US$15,82.28) has to pay more than NT$3,000 in total health premiums per month,
an amount that will be lowered to about NT$1,600 under the new system.</P>
      <P>In comparison, a single-person household will see its monthly premium rise from
the present NT$785 to NT$1,750 if the premium rate is set at 3.5 percent.</P>
      <P>Yaung said it is a common trend in advanced countries for single people with
higher incomes to have to shoulder a higher financial burden for public health
insurance programs.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, he went on, the health insurance premiums will continue to be jointly
paid for by the insured, their employers and the government under the new
system. At present, the government subsidy comes from both central and local
governments, but the new system will exempt local governments from the financial
burden.</P>
      <P>The new system will also set a minimum payment of about NT$3,600 per person per
annum, Yaung said.</P>
      <P>The draft package will soon be sent to the Legislative Yuan for screening.</P>
      <P>Yaung said he will personally call on individual lawmakers to seek their support
for the package so that the new system can be put into effect as soon as
possible.</P>
      <P>Earlier this month, Yaung said that if all goes well, the new program could be
implemented by 2012.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the DOH and the BNHI were scheduled to hold a series of public
hearings to brief the public on details of the new healthcare program.</P>
      <P>As of the end of last year, the health insurance program had accumulated a
deficit of NT$58.8 billion.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Harvard Business School Professor Michael Porter said Thursday in Taipei that he
supports a proposed trade pact between Taiwan and China, but he also urged
Taiwan to work on its weaknesses to attract foreign investment.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan already has a huge economic relationship with China despite the fact
that there is no framework, " he said in a speech delivered at a forum held at
the National Dr. Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall.</P>
      <P>"What we are talking about here actually is just, formalizing something  that's
already  happening,  "  the  well-known economist-turned-strategist said.</P>
      <P>Michael DeNoma, chairman of the Taipei-based Chinatrust Commercial Bank and one
of the panelists at the forum, asked Porter if there are any alternatives to the
economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) that is due to be signed between
the two sides of the Taiwan Strait later this year.</P>
      <P>"I thought about that, " Porter replied. "I don't see any alternative, any
practical alternative. But more importantly, I don't see why we would want an
alternative."</P>
      <P>Taiwan can construct a formal trade relationship with China, which can allow
Taiwan to continue to substantially enhance its economy over time, he said.</P>
      <P>There are many agreements like this that other countries have signed with China
and in many cases, these countries have much less strength than Taiwan, Porter
said.</P>
      <P>"I am confident that you will be much better off with such a framework than you
will be without it," he added.</P>
      <P>Porter also urged Taiwan to focus on "getting the fundamentals right" by
building an attractive business environment or establishing a good
infrastructure rather than worrying about the size of China.</P>
      <P>"Size, per se, is nothing to fear," he said.</P>
      <P>Porter said, that for example, his home state of Massachusetts in the United
States has to compete with much bigger states such as New York, Connecticut,
Texas and California.</P>
      <P>"Because we have a very educated workforce, because we are a knowledge center,
because we are innovative, because we have a very strong base in financial
services and a few other fields, we have been able to prosper," he noted.</P>
      <P>While lauding Taiwan for its economic achievements over the past decades, Porter
said the country needs to work harder to attract world-class companies.</P>
      <P>He also called on the country  to address  "some chronic weaknesses" by reducing
corruption,  bureaucracy and regulatory complexity, as well as improving labor
force flexibility and the quality and transparency of the financial market.</P>
      <P>He further noted that Taiwan needs to strengthen innovation and research
development in local universities, pointing out that they did not rank high on
the list of Taiwanese originators of U.S. patents between 2004 and 2008.</P>

      <P>There is no solid evidence to show that China is trying to undermine Taiwan's

Thursday.</P>
      <P>Fielding questions from opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) lawmaker
Chen Ying at a legislative session, Yang said his ministry and the National
Security Bureau (NSB) will keep monitoring ensuing developments between the two

a US$40 million cooperation plan with Palau to help the South Pacific nation
exploit oil reserves.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairwoman Lai Shin-yuan said Thursday that
Taiwan is free to negotiate and sign free trade agreements (FTAs) with foreign
countries without the need for China's approval.</P>
      <P>Lai made the remarks at a legislative session while answering questions raised
by Chiu Yi-ying of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) , who said
China will still seek to block Taiwan's efforts to ink FTAs with its trade
partners even if a planned cross- strait economic cooperation framework
agreement (ECFA) is signed.</P>
      <P>Lai said Taiwan is seeking to forge the ECFA with China because it has been the
country's largest export market for the past seven years and is the one that is
most hotly sought-after by all other leading trading countries.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, Taiwan is redoubling its efforts to seek FTAs with the world's
major economic players, Lai went on.</P>
      <P>"Both sides (Taiwan and China) should take into account each other's concerns in
negotiating the ECFA.... and I believe China dare not say that you (Taiwan)
should not sign FTAs after the cross-strait deal is signed,'" Lai said.</P>
      <P>Earlier that same day, the Legislative Yuan's Interior Affairs Committee voted
down a motion initiated by several DPP lawmakers to include a phrase that reads:
"China should not stand in the way of Taiwan's signing of FTAs with other
counties" in the text of the planned trade pact.</P>
      <P>The DPP lawmakers had asked that the pact should be in both Chinese and English,
with "agreement" being in the official wording of the pact rather than
"arrangement, " which is the word used in the trade deal between Hong Kong and
China -- the Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement.</P>
      <P>The DPP-led pan-green camp has been vigorously opposed to the ECFA over concerns
that it will increase Taiwan's economic dependence on China and cause job losses
in some local sectors.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou, who doubles as chairman of the ruling Kuomintang, is
scheduled to hold a TV debate on the ECFA with DPP Chairperson Tsai Ing-wen May
25.</P>

      <P>EVA Airways said its fare cuts for non-stop flights from Taiwan to Shanghai,

      <P>The government should heed the plight of the more than 6,000 foreign crew
working aboard Taiwanese fishing vessels, many of whom are not fairly paid and
are even denied labor and health insurance coverage, activists said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Opposition Democratic Progressive Party Legislator Lin Shu-fen and Ku Yu-ling,
president of the Taiwan International Workers Association (TIWA) , made the
appeal at a joint news conference held at the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>A 28-year-old Philippine fishery worker identified only by his first name of
Joseph said at the news conference that he has only been paid NT$20,418
(US$646.14) despite having worked for more than eight months aboard a deep-sea
fishing boat out of Suao in the northeastern county of Yilan.</P>
      <P>Joseph said he originally expected to receive between NT$70,000 and NT$80,000 in
wages and was shocked and despondent when he saw the figure written on the
salary envelope handed over to him by a manpower broker.</P>
      <P>The broker not only rejected his request for a detailed breakdown of his pay,
but also threatened to repatriate him. Joseph then took shelter on a fishing
boat on which one of his friends was working but the manpower broker refused to
return his Alien Resident Certificate and only gave him a copy, forcing him to
seek the assistance of the Yilan County labor affairs bureau and the TIWA.</P>
      <P>Since Taiwan opened its doors to foreign fishery workers in 1992, Lin said,
6,600 nationals from the Philippines and Indonesia have worked aboard Taiwanese
fishing boats. There have been many reports about these workers failing to
receive reasonable pay or even being denied labor and health insurance coverage.</P>
      <P>For her part, TIWA President Ku said fishery workers account for only 2 percent
of the total foreign laborers in Taiwan, with most of them based in Suao and in
the eastern counties of Hualien and Taitung.</P>
      <P>"They tend to work at sea, with few holidays, and have to work long hours
without overtime pay," Ku said, adding that their salaries are also often
subject to arbitrary deductions by their employers.</P>
      <P>Worse still, she went on, there have been many cases in which local employers
have refused to offer them labor and health insurance coverage,  instead buying
far cheaper group accident insurance policies for them.</P>
      <P>Ku urged the Bureau of Labor Insurance (BLI) under the Council of Labor Affairs
and the Bureau of National Health Insurance (BNHI) under the Department of
Health to investigate whether foreign fishery workers are being covered by their
employers in terms of labor and health insurance.</P>
      <P>In response, Lin Fang-chu, a BLI official, said the bureau had already demanded
that the 2,500-plus local employers present full name lists of their foreign
fishery workers and provide labor insurance coverage to all their employees.</P>
      <P>Hung Ching-jung, a BNHI official who attended the news conference on behalf of
the bureau,  said his agency will collect more information through cross-agency
cooperation and push employers to provide health insurance coverage to foreign
fishery workers.</P>

Island, Batanes Province, 540 km north of Manila.</P>
      <P>The MOFA said it immediately instructed Taiwan's representative office in the
Philippines to contact the Philippine authorities upon learning that the three
men were still missing. After receiving approval from the Philippines, Taiwan's

      <P>As the six initial members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)
have formed a zero-tariff zone with China, concern over how the ASEAN-China free
trade agreement will impact Taiwan's exports has been a hot topic in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>A finance official said Thursday, however, that the impact might not be
reflected in short-term trade figures.</P>
      <P>Lin Li-chen, director-general of the Department of Statistics of the Ministry of
Finance said that in the first three months of this year, Taiwan's exports to
the six nations -- Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and
Thailand -- amounted to US$9.04 billion, up 64.4 percent from the corresponding
period of last year.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taiwan exported US$26.4 billion-worth of products to China in the
first quarter, representing a 75.6 percent growth from the amount of the same
period of the preceding year, according to government statistics.</P>
      <P>In the January-March period, exports to China accounted for 28.9 percent of
Taiwan's overall export value, while exports to Hong Kong accounted for 13.8
percent and exports to the six ASEAN nations accounted for 14.6 percent.</P>
      <P>Lin said that since the ASEAN-China free trade agreement took effect only three
months ago, it would not be easy to assess the impact on Taiwan's foreign trade.
Many elements, such as overall economic environment and export structure, must
be taken into consideration while making an analysis, she added.</P>
      <P>According to a Finance Ministry press release,  continuous improving of the
economic environment has helped boost Taiwan's export business, and high growth
rates in two-way trade were seen mainly because of the low base for comparison.</P>
      <P>In the first quarter of this year, the export value totaled US$61.8 billion, an
increase of US$21.3 billion, or 52.5 percent, over the same period of last year.
Imports in the January-March period totaled US$56.9 billion, an increase of
US$25 billion, or 78.4 percent, from the year-earlier level.</P>
      <P>While electronic products remained the leading foreign exchange earners,
grossing US$17 billion in the first quarter of this year, other major export
items were metal products, optical equipment, plastic products, chemical
products, machinery and textiles, as well as information and telecommunications
products.</P>

      <P>The government is planning to unveil a series of measures that will create
around 115,000 new jobs starting from June, Council for Economic Planning and
Development (CEPD) Vice Chairman San Gee said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a press conference, San elaborated on a CEPD program delivered at a
Cabinet meeting earlier that same day. The program is aimed at boosting the
economy and stabilizing employment.</P>
      <P>As low private investment is the major reason behind the present high
unemployment, the government is set to encourage private investment worth
NT$1.18 trillion (US$3.74 billion) this year, which in return will create 57,200
jobs, San said.</P>
      <P>Another 30,000 jobs will be made available under a plan by the Council  of Labor
Affairs  in case the Industrial  Innovation Regulations designed to attract
leading international enterprises to Taiwan fail to pass the legislature in
June.</P>
      <P>The government will also reintroduce a program to offer 30,000 jobs to new
university graduates for six months from June. The program has been in place
since April 1, 2008, and will come to an end in September 30.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a program in which the central government subsidizes local
governments that hire temporary workers will also be extended for another six

    <HEADLINE>Employers urged to give foreign fishery workers insurance coverage</HEADLINE>

      <P>The government should heed the plight of the more than 6,000 foreign crew
working aboard Taiwanese fishing vessels, many of whom are not fairly paid and
are even denied labor and health insurance coverage, activists said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Opposition Democratic Progressive Party Legislator Lin Shu-fen and Ku Yu-ling,
president of the Taiwan International Workers Association (TIWA) , made the
appeal at a joint news conference held at the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>A 28-year-old Philippine fishery worker identified only by his first name of
Joseph said at the news conference that he has only been paid NT$20,418
(US$646.14) despite having worked for more than eight months aboard a deep-sea
fishing boat out of Suao in the northeastern county of Yilan.</P>
      <P>Joseph said he originally expected to receive between NT$70,000 and NT$80,000 in
wages and was shocked and despondent when he saw the figure written on the
salary envelope handed over to him by a manpower broker.</P>
      <P>The broker not only rejected his request for a detailed breakdown of his pay,
but also threatened to repatriate him. Joseph then took shelter on a fishing
boat on which one of his friends was working but the manpower broker refused to
return his Alien Resident Certificate and only gave him a copy, forcing him to
seek the assistance of the Yilan County labor affairs bureau and the TIWA.</P>
      <P>Since Taiwan opened its doors to foreign fishery workers in 1992, Lin said,
6,600 nationals from the Philippines and Indonesia have worked aboard Taiwanese
fishing boats. There have been many reports about these workers failing to
receive reasonable pay or even being denied labor and health insurance coverage.</P>
      <P>For her part, TIWA President Ku said fishery workers account for only 2 percent
of the total foreign laborers in Taiwan, with most of them based in Suao and in
the eastern counties of Hualien and Taitung.</P>
      <P>"They tend to work at sea, with few holidays, and have to work long hours
without overtime pay," Ku said, adding that their salaries are also often
subject to arbitrary deductions by their employers.</P>
      <P>Worse still, she went on, there have been many cases in which local employers
have refused to offer them labor and health insurance coverage,  instead buying
far cheaper group accident insurance policies for them.</P>
      <P>Ku urged the Bureau of Labor Insurance (BLI) under the Council of Labor Affairs
and the Bureau of National Health Insurance (BNHI) under the Department of
Health to investigate whether foreign fishery workers are being covered by their
employers in terms of labor and health insurance.</P>
      <P>In response, Lin Fang-chu, a BLI official, said the bureau had already demanded
that the 2,500-plus local employers present full name lists of their foreign
fishery workers and provide labor insurance coverage to all their employees.</P>
      <P>Hung Ching-jung, a BNHI official who attended the news conference on behalf of
the bureau,  said his agency will collect more information through cross-agency
cooperation and push employers to provide health insurance coverage to foreign
fishery workers.</P>

      <P>Three fishermen aboard a stranded Taiwanese fishing boat in the northern
Philippines were rescued Thursday while another three were missing, Taiwan's
Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said later that day.</P>
      <P>The Okinawa-registered Taiwanese fishing boat the Cheng Cheng Feng, with a crew
of six -- two Taiwanese and four Indonesians -- ran aground early Thursday, the
ministry said.</P>
      <P>However, a story published by German's Deutsche Presse-Agentur (DPA) reported
that all six had been rescued. The story quoted Chief Superintendent Roberto
Damian, a regional police director, as saying that one was rescued by helicopter
and the other five were rescued by other vessels from rough waters off Mabudis
Island, Batanes Province, 540 km north of Manila.</P>
      <P>The MOFA said it immediately instructed Taiwan's representative office in the
Philippines to contact the Philippine authorities upon learning that the three
men were still missing. After receiving approval from the Philippines, Taiwan's
Coast Guard Administration dispatched rescue boats to the area for a joint
search and rescue mission with its Philippine counterparts, the ministry said.</P>
      <P>The mission to find the three missing men was still ongoing, the MOFA said.</P>
      <P>Local authorities suspect that the fishermen were poaching in the area when the
accident occurred, Damian was quoted by DPA as saying.</P>

    <HEADLINE>China Times: Original innovation version is the best</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>04/09/10  10:42:54
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A bill on industrial innovation is on the priority list for this legislative
session. While the legislation was shelved in the previous session because of a
controversial article concerning tax breaks for multinational corporations with
operations headquarters in Taiwan, two new controversies over the bill are
emerging.</P>
      <P>One of them is a clause initiated by the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) that would
provide temporary subsidies for small- and medium-sized businesses that increase
staff hiring, especially older workers. The other is a proposal by the
opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) to further lower the corporate
income tax rate to 17.5 percent, down from the 20 percent proposed by the
Ministry of Finance.</P>
      <P>First, the DPP's proposal is a product of populism that is against the Budget
Act. It is aimed at winning favor with voters and lacks careful consideration.
Lowering the tax rate by 2.5 percentage points would mean reducing the
government's annual revenue by NT$33 billion. Is this something a responsible
political party should be doing?</P>
      <P>As for the hiring subsidies, anyone can see that they are totally irrelevant to
"industrial innovation." Subsidizing the hiring of older  workers  would  in
fact be unfavorable  to innovation. Furthermore, measures to ease unemployment
can be implemented through administrative means. Including them in a law would
deprive them of flexibility.</P>
      <P>We support the original version of the bill that was drafted by the Ministry of
Economic Affairs. The two recent proposals have demonstrated the laziness and
worthlessness of our legislators.</P>
      <P>If the ruling and opposition parties keep using this kind of attitude to deal
with legislation, we can say nothing that is any more pleasant to the ears than
"shameful." (April 9, 2010)</P>

      <P>Surmounting the 2008-2009 global recession, Taiwan's export trade is expected to
ride a recovery wave this year and to surpass the previous record performance
set in 2008, a local economist forecast Friday.</P>
      <P>The rise in export  trade  in January  and February  was understandable because
of increased demand during the Chinese New Year holiday from China -- Taiwan's
largest export outlet -- but a surge in March, to the tune of US$23.37 billion,
up 50.1 percent year-on-year, is an indication that the upward trade trend is
back, said Cheng-mount Cheng, a vice president and economist with Citibank
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"Judging from the brisk performance in the first quarter, totaling US$61.8
billion, the country's exports this year may surpass the 2008 record of
US$255.63 billion, " Cheng said.</P>
      <P>The Q1 export value was an increase of US$21.3 billion, or 52.5 percent over the
same period of 2009,  while imports in the January-March period totaled US$56.9
billion, up US$25 billion, or 78.4 percent year-on-year,  said Lin Lee-jen,
director of the Department of Statistics under the Ministry of Finance (MOF).</P>
      <P>Lin said that although recovery in the United States and the European Union has
been relatively slower, the U.S. per capita consumption had climbed for five
consecutive months as of February, while the purchase manager index in the euro
region surged to a new high in March -- both good news for Taiwan in terms of
export trade.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Kung Ming-hsin, vice president of the Taiwan Institute of Economic
Research, a local think tank, said Taiwan's brisk exports in the first quarter
symbolize that the global economy is on a fast track to recovery.</P>
      <P>"Unless governments suspend their stimulus mechanisms that have been in place
since late 2008, the recovery trend is set here and any reverse will not be
possible in the short run," Kung estimated.</P>
      <P>"I forecast that the rebound and growth trend will continue at least until the
middle of the year," he said.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, William Fu, a senior business manager with Standard Chartered Bank
in Taipei, sees the trend differently, and said that fast or slow recovery in
the U.S. and Europe will be the major variable.</P>
      <P>"Whether U.S. and European employment will pick up significantly will be the
major observation benchmark," Fu contended.</P>
      <P>In related news,  Taiwan exported US$26.4 billion-worth of products to China in
the first quarter, representing a 75.6 percent growth over the figure posted in
the same period of 2009, according to MOF statistics.</P>
      <P>In the January-March period, exports to China accounted for 28.9 percent of
Taiwan's overall export value, while exports to Hong Kong accounted for 13.8
percent.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Apple Daily: Some problems are unrelated to who is in power</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>04/09/10  12:16:59
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>We used to think that incompetence and lack of control over the legislature were
the reasons why former President Chen Shui-bian failed to resolve some problems
during his eight years in power.</P>
      <P>But we were wrong. After several rounds of changeovers of power in Taiwan, we
have come to realize that while some of those problems were not resolved because
of the democratic nature of our political system, others could be attributed to
human nature.</P>
      <P>One example is the country's suicide rate, which has remained almost as high
during the present administration of President Ma Ying-jeou as it was during the
former Chen administration. Another is government efficiency, which is as low
during the Ma administration as it was in the Chen administration.</P>
      <P>When judging government efficiency, we tend to compare the present time to the
past under the rule of the late President Chiang Ching-kuo. There is also a
tendency to compare Taiwan's vacillation and procrastination to China's high
efficiency.</P>
      <P>This is unfair. Unlike the authoritarian regime of Chiang and the communist
regime in China, both of which stress efficiency, the democratic government of
Taiwan in the most recent decade pays more attention to the rights of the
people.</P>
      <P>Since democracy is our choice, we have to endure the problems caused by
inefficiency. As for corruption, it is human nature.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's democracy is only a little more than 10 years old and is still in its
breaking-in period. With more effort by the ruling and opposition parties, we
can expect a bright future. (April 9, 2010)</P>

    <HEADLINE>Talk of the day -- Is ECFA Taiwan's only option?</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>04/09/10  12:33:24
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The question  of whether  Taiwan should  sign an economic cooperation framework
agreement (ECFA) -- seen as a scaled-back free trade agreement (FTA) -- with
China remains a hot-button issue in local society.</P>
      <P>In a speech delivered in Taipei Thursday, Harvard Business School Professor
Michael Porter said he supports the proposed ECFA deal between the two sides of
the Taiwan Strait because it would allow Taiwan to continue to substantially
enhance its economy over time.</P>
      <P>On that same day, tension crackled between the Presidential Office and the
opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) as both sides stepped up
preparations for an April 25 debate between President  Ma Ying-jeou  and DPP
Chairperson  Tsai Ing-wen on ECFA-related topics.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from local media coverage of the issue: United Daily
News:</P>
      <P>Speaking in a forum held at the Dr. Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall in Taipei
Thursday, Porter said the proposed cross-strait trade pact is just a move to
formalize "something that's already happening."</P>
      <P>"Taiwan already has a huge economic relationship with China despite the fact
that there is no framework, " the renowned corporate management strategist
observed.</P>
      <P>Responding to a question by Michael DeNoma, chairman of the Taipei-based
Chinatrust Commercial Bank and one of the panelists at the forum on whether
there are any alternatives to the ECFA initiative, Porter said he had thought
about that.</P>
      <P>"I don't see any alternative, any practical alternative. But more importantly, I
don't see why we would want an alternative, " he replied.</P>
      <P>There are many ECFA-like agreements that other countries have signed with China
and in many cases, these countries have much less strength than Taiwan, Porter
said.</P>
      <P>"I am confident that you will be much better off with such a framework than you
would be without it," he added.</P>
      <P>Porter also urged Taiwan to focus on "getting the fundamentals right"  by
building  an attractive  business  environment  and establishing a good
infrastructure rather than worrying about the size of China.</P>
      <P>"Size, per se, is nothing to fear," he said. (April 9, 2010). Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>The administration of President Ma Ying-jeou has repeatedly intimidated the
people of Taiwan, claiming that if Taiwan fails to sign an ECFA with China, it
will be marginalized after the formation of the ASEAN Plus One (China) free
trade area.</P>
      <P>The trade data released by the Ministry of Finance (MOF) Thursday, however,
seemed to be a slap in the face for the Ma administration. While ASEAN Plus One
took effect at the beginning of this year, Taiwan's exports remained robust in
the first quarter, with the amount reaching US$61.8 billion -- the second
highest in history for the same period.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Taiwan's exports to six major ASEAN member states amounted to US$9.04
billion in Q1, which was also the second highest in Taiwan-ASEAN trade history.
Taiwan's Q1 shipments to China and Hong Kong as a whole even set a new quarterly
record of US$26.42 billion.</P>
      <P>All these figures point to the strength and resilience of Taiwan's economy even
after the formation of ASEAN Plus One.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless,  Lin Lee-jen,  director-general  of the MOF's Department of
Statistics, said it might be premature to make any judgment on the impact of
ASEAN Plus One on Taiwan's foreign trade simply based on a quarterly statistical
report. (April 9, 2010). China Times:</P>
      <P>Tempers flared between aides of President Ma and DPP Chairperson Tsai Thursday
over whether the Presidential Office should furnish Tsai before the April 25
debate with information about the ECFA content and the "early harvest" items to
be subject to immediate tariff concessions or exemptions under the agreement.</P>
      <P>Instead of responding directly to the DPP's request for such information,
Presidential Office spoeksman Lo Chih-chiang asked Tsai to answer three
questions before the debate, including how many items Tsai thought should be
included in the "early harvest" list as well as what alternative Tsai would
propose to an ECFA and that she should make public her reasons for deciding to
oppose the pact. (April 9, 2010).</P>

    <HEADLINE>Industrial innovation tax likely to be lowered to 17%</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Controversies over tax legislation to be included in an industrial innovation
bill are likely to be cleared up now that the Executive Yuan has reportedly
agreed to accept a new version  that puts corporate  income tax rate at 17
percent, Legislative Yuan sources said Friday.</P>
      <P>If the 17-percent rate is acceptable to the Executive Yuan -- which had proposed
a drop from the existing rate of 20 percent to 15 percent in its initial version
referred to the Legislative Yuan for deliberation -- further negotiations by the
ruling Kuomintang (KMT) and the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
over the bill are expected to go much more smoothly.</P>
      <P>The industrial innovation bill failed to clear the legislative floor in late
March due to a filibuster by DPP lawmakers over many controversies, mainly on
tax breaks for multinational corporations with operations headquarters in Taiwan
and relaxed restrictions on the establishment of industrial parks or zones.</P>
      <P>A member of the KMT legislative caucus said that at present, the Executive Yuan
appears to accept two versions concerning the tax breaks -- either maintaining
the existing rate or lowering it to 17 percent, with the latter enjoying greater
favor.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, according to the KMT legislator, a 17.5 percent corporate income tax
rate proposed by the DPP will definitely not be considered.</P>
      <P>Lee Chun-yi, a whip of the DPP legislative caucus, said prior to negotiations
with  the  KMT legislators  that  the 17-percent concessionary tax rate proposal
significantly narrows the gap between the two parties on the issue.</P>
      <P>"We welcome it as a positive move," Lee said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng said Friday that legislators
of different political persuasions had been working hard since early that
morning  on screening,  discussing  and deliberating the bill article by
article.</P>
      <P>"Patience is needed here," Wang said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A police officer in Taipei County has made headlines for knocking down a
scantily clad betel nut girl and dragging her to the police station after she
called him names in response to his warning that she should dress properly.</P>
      <P>The incident came to light because it was caught on a security camera installed
by the owner of the betel nut stall, and the officer was disciplined and
transferred to another job for his brutality.</P>
      <P>Police will have difficulty carrying out their jobs if there are no clear
guidelines on how to stop betel nut girls from attracting customers by dressing
in as little as possible.</P>
      <P>The practice will not die out if these girls simply throw on a jacket in front
of the police and take it off once the police leave. However, if the police want
to crack down on the practice, they have to do it properly in the eyes of the
law and of the people. They are debasing themselves and their job by beating a
girl.</P>
      <P>Betel nut girls dressed scantily are not a serious crime, and the police could
easily ticket them or treat them in a more appropriate way than beating them,
even when they abuse the police.</P>
      <P>But while public attention was caught by the policeman and the girl, the betel
nut stall's owner, who hid behind the scenes and recorded the whole fracas with
a camera without bothering to come to the aid of the girl, was missing from the
coverage of the story.</P>
      <P>We have to ask does he or she have no responsibility at all?</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>As most local fans set their eyes on Washington Nationals pitcher Chien-Ming
Wang, the most successful Taiwanese baseballer in the U.S. Major League to date,
more than 20 Taiwanese players in the U.S. minor leagues are trying to work
their way up, hoping some day to make it to the big league.</P>
      <P>Twelve of the 27 Taiwanese players in the minors, including former Los Angeles
Dodgers shortstop Hu Chin-lung -- now demoted to the Albuquerque Isotopes in the
Triple-A -- open their baseball season Friday, the opening day of the 2010 full-
season minor leagues, while the other 15 are still participating in extended
spring training and have not been assigned.</P>
      <P>The 2010 major league season opening day on April 5 was not so exciting for
local fans, as they did not have many players to cheer about. Left-handed
reliever Ni Fu-te of the Detroit Tigers was the only Taiwanese player to make
the 25-man roster on opening day, with Wang and Dodgers left-hander Kuo Hong-
chih both still undergoing rehabilitation from injury.</P>
      <P>The good news is that there are eight players in the Double-A teams -- a record
for Taiwanese players -- who could earn callups to the Majors in the later part
of the season if they perform well like Wang, who was called up to the big
league in 2005 after six years in the New York Yankees farm system.</P>
      <P>Among these major league hopefuls are Hu, who played sparingly with the Dodgers,
and right-handed pitcher Lo Chia-jen of the Houston Astros, who made Double-A in
his first season and accumulated three saves to go with a 2.10 earned run
average (ERA).</P>
      <P>Lo has been ranked as the second-best Asian prospect in the minors by Baseball
Digest Daily (BDD), a website focusing on baseball coverage. The other three
also made the top 10 list, including fifth -ranked Boston Red Sox outfielder Lin
Che-hsuan, Cleveland Indians pitcher Lee Chen-chang at No. 6 and Seattle
Mariners outfielder Lo Kuo-hui at No. 9</P>
      <P>Other players in the Double-A are Oakland Athletics outfielder Chen Yung-chi,
Colorado Rockies pitcher Lo Chin-lung, Boston Red Sox infielder Chiang Chih-
hsien and Chicago White Sox pitcher Chen Hun-wen.</P>
      <P>According to the BDD, the mid-level minors are crammed with Asian talent, which
also includes players from Japan and South Korea.</P>

      <P>Han, on his fourth and final day in Taiwan, was briefed by officials from the

      <P>Opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen on Friday
renewed her party's call for a referendum to settle the differences over a
proposed economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) with China.</P>
      <P>Tsai said she will responsibly present her party's views when debating the issue
with President Ma Ying-jeou April 25 and will "leave the final choice to the
people."</P>
      <P>"The most effective way to resolve social confrontation is to hold a referendum
to allow the people to decide on the ECFA on their own, " Tsai said when
receiving representatives of the Citizen Congress Watch, a civic organization
monitoring legislators.</P>
      <P>According to Tsai, Taiwan is a country suitable for referendums because of the
high educational level of its people and its maturing society.</P>
      <P>Multiple options should be available in a democratic society, she said,
expressing disagreement with a media report claiming that "ECFA is Taiwan's only
option."</P>
      <P>She noted that President Ma has insisted since 2008 that signing the agreement
with China was a necessity but said that the opposition had yet to obtain any
comprehensive information regarding its details.</P>
      <P>She voiced disappointment at the Presidential Office's refusal to provide the
information requested by the DPP in preparation for the debate.</P>
      <P>The DPP has requested access to the early harvest list proposed by  the
government,  the  draft  of  the  agreement,  and government-commissioned ECFA
assessment reports.</P>
      <P>The Presidential Office turned down the proposal, however, saying the
information had to be withheld because the negotiations are still going on.</P>
      <P>Tsai explained that the DPP was asking for the information because it wants to
ensure the debate will be conducted on an equal footing, not because it was
"playing a dirty trick, " as the Presidential Office alleged.</P>
      <P>Through the debate, the DPP hopes that Ma will directly explain to the people

      <P>Visitors to a computer show that opened in Taipei a day earlier lined up to
experience the latest 3D technology for TVs, but experts said it is still too
early for the technology to become popular due to a lack of content.</P>
      <P>Samsung is showcasing the first 3D LED TV that will be available in Taiwan at
the show, which runs until April 12 and features a wide variety of electronics
products, including smartphones, LED monitors, e-readers and digital cameras.</P>
      <P>"It is the first time consumers in Taiwan have seen the Samsung C7000 3D LED TV,
which is due to hit the local market in early May," the South Korean company
said in a press statement.</P>
      <P>Sony Taiwan also set up a small exhibition hall in which visitors could wear 3D
glasses while watching a U.S. animated film. Sony is scheduled to release its 3D
TV in Taiwan in June.</P>
      <P>However, several visitors were dissatisfied with their viewing experience.</P>
      <P>A group of students told CNA that the 3D effect was not as good as they had
expected.</P>
      <P>"It made me a bit dizzy," said one girl.</P>
      <P>Another visitor, a middle-aged man surnamed Chen, complained that the images are
"shaky."</P>
      <P>"I also felt a sense of oppressiveness," he added.</P>
      <P>Taking into consideration the quality and the price, which is much higher than
that of a traditional TV, Chen said he wouldn't buy a 3D TV at the moment.</P>
      <P>"If you buy a 3D TV, what are you going to watch on it? There are very few 3D
movies, " said Danny Yao, managing director of BenQ Taiwan.</P>

      <P>The government is planning to allocate a budget of NT$95 billion (US$3 billion)
over a 10-year period to assist workers in vulnerable industries after Taiwan
signs an economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) with China, Premier Wu
Den-yih said Friday.</P>
      <P>The funds will be used to help affected workers make the move to other
professions and stabilize their lives after the ECFA is implemented, Wu told a
seminar on the impact of the proposed cross-Taiwan Strait trade deal held at
I-Shou University in southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Saying that the tariff-concession agreement is aimed at stepping up Taiwan's
competitiveness and helping businessmen amid fierce foreign competition, he
pledged that the government will stick to its principle of protecting the
interests of Taiwan's people when negotiating the pact.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and China are expected to hold the third round of ECFA talks in Beijing
soon after concluding their second round of talks in Taiwan, which produced
little progress on forging common ground regarding "early harvest lists" drawn
up by the two sides for priority treatment.</P>
      <P>The items included on each side's list would be allowed to enter the other side
with preferential customs rates or duty free, making Taiwanese goods more
competitive in the Chinese market.</P>
      <P>Wu reiterated that the government will not allow the entry of Chinese workers or
open Taiwan's doors wider to vegetables and other farm products from China.</P>
      <P>Earlier that same day, the premier inspected reconstruction work on the

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou affirmed the Ministry of National Defense's  (MND's)
efforts to stamp out corruption Friday, saying that the scrutiny was necessary
to protect the honor of the country's senior military officials.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a news conference organized to mark the first anniversary of the
military's anti-corruption campaign, the president said the blanket probe of all
promotions involving general and flag officers might have caused displeasure to
some, but the integrity of those who held up to scrutiny is now ensured.</P>
      <P>"Their sacrifice is worthwhile," the president said, adding that he had asked
Minister of National Defense Kao Hua-chu to convey his apologies to the officers
who turned out to be innocent after being probed.</P>
      <P>He lauded the MND's efforts to weed out corruption by probing more than 4,000
people and looking into more than 80,000 cases.</P>
      <P>"I was briefed monthly by the ministry during the past year and offered my
advice," the president said.</P>
      <P>He invited the public, including TV commentators who often criticize the
government for alleged corruption, to provide any information they can find
about corruption involving officials.</P>
      <P>"It is our motto that no one will be spared and that no one will be punished
wrongfully," the president said.</P>
      <P>Ma ordered a sweeping probe April 8 last year when the image of the armed forces
was in tatters because of a series of corruption cases, which prompted
widespread allegations that promotion-buying was rampant among senior military
officers.</P>
      <P>In a news conference the previous day, Chang Shan-dong, a leading military
inspector, said that military prosecutors had probed 58 alleged corruption cases
involving 156 officers.</P>
      <P>The investigation of 50 of them had already closed, leading to the indictment of
13 people, notably Lt. Gen. He Yung-chien, former deputy commander-in-chief of
the Reserve Command, and Maj. Gen. Chen Ching-chon, former chief of the Defense
Mission to the United States.</P>
      <P>On the allegations that some senior officers owe their posts to bribes paid to
their superiors, Chang said the Ministry of National Defense has examined the
promotions of 900 to the rank of general or flag officers, including some who
have already retired.</P>
      <P>Among them, 124 have been referred to an ad hoc investigation team for further
investigation because of irregularities in their promotions.</P>
      <P>Chang said the anti-corruption campaign is a long-term effort that will be
continued by the Defense Ministry without any let up.</P>
      <P>In a related development Friday, the MND decided to set up an ethics unit with
the help of the Ministry of Justice (MOJ) to crack down on the corruption.</P>
      <P>During a meeting presided over by Minister without Portfolio Kao Su-po, the MOJ
agreed to revise the law to pave the way for the ethics unit.</P>
      <P>Under the existing law, the military, the legislature and schools cannot have
ethics units.</P>
      <P>The revision, which will have to be approved by the Executive Yuan, is
considered necessary to carry out Ma's instruction to weed out corruption in the
military.</P>
      <P>In the preliminary stage, the military service ethics unit will be led by a lead
prosecutor from the MOJ who will work independently from the armed forces' chief
ombudsman, who at present is the official responsible for probes into corruption
allegations involving military officers.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the MOJ will train anti-corruption officers who will man the ethics
unit under the MND.</P>

      <P>Only 22.1 percent of office workers in Taiwan own their homes, and 87.01 percent
of homeowners are burdened with home loans, according to the results of a poll
published Friday by 1111 Job Bank.</P>
      <P>Among homeowners, 82.18 percent use their houses themselves, while others rent
out their houses or have relatives living in them, the poll found.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 76.24 percent of homeowners bought their houses themselves, with
51.49 percent using only their own money and 24.75 percent receiving financial
support from their parents, the study showed.</P>
      <P>According to the poll, those with home loans spend an average 38 percent of
their monthly salaries repaying their debts, with 13.43 percent of them using
between 51 percent and 60 percent of their monthly salaries.</P>
      <P>Asked to rate the level of financial pressure they are under based on a scale of
0-100 points, 22.39 percent of those with loans ranked themselves between 91 and
100. The average ranking given by those with loans was 63.</P>
      <P>It also found that females felt more financial pressure than males. Ho Chi-
sheng, a public relations chief at the job bank, said that was because men are
normally better paid and had a better chance of receiving financial assistance
from their parents as the purchases are usually made to raise a family.</P>
      <P>Most women purchased houses as an investment, Ho said.</P>
      <P>By industrial sector, office workers in the real estate sector were found more
likely to own homes than workers in other sectors.</P>
      <P>The online poll was conducted between March 26 and April 8, with 1,097 valid
samples collected. It had a confidence level of 95 percent and a 2.95 percent
margin of error.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's only running water supplier said Friday that with the exception of the
southern Kaohsiung area, the country's water reserves are sufficient to meet
demand until the end of June.</P>
      <P>Hu Nan-jer, a vice president of Taiwan Water Corp. (Taiwater) , said that stable
water supplies will be ensured until that time, thanks to several cold fronts
since the beginning of this year that brought large quantities of rain to
northern and central regions.</P>
      <P>Hu said that although water in major reservoirs in northern and central Taiwan
have reached normal levels, southern Taiwan is still suffering from a lack of
water, with major reservoirs in the Kaohsiung area at low levels.</P>
      <P>He added that the water company has been undertaking a series of measures to
increase supplies in the Kaohsiung area, work that has included drilling new
wells, tapping more underground water sources, and deepening and dredging
reservoirs.</P>
      <P>"After these measures are complete, the water output in the Kaohsiung area is
expected to be increased by 200,000 cubic meters to 400,000 cubic meters daily,"
Hu said.</P>
      <P>"The increased water output will ensure stable water supplies in the Kaohsiung
area until mid-May," he continued.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taiwater said that if drought conditions persist in southern Taiwan,
contingency measures will be put in place under the supervision of the Ministry
of Economic Affairs.</P>
      <P>These measures will include lower water pipe pressure during daily off-peak
periods as a level one move. At level two, water supplies to heavy water users
such as swimming pools will be restricted.</P>
      <P>At level three, water supplies will be stopped alternately in different
districts, and at level four, a water rationing mechanism will be put in place
to supply water only at certain times and at a certain volume, Taiwater said.</P>

      <P>Taiwan will focus on energy conservation and carbon reduction in 2010, with a
goal of using 3.34 million kilowatts of recycled energy and building 25 low-
carbon communities by the end of the year.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) presented 18 motion projects to the
Executive Yuan Thursday.</P>
      <P>Under the plans, Taiwan will seek to improve energy efficiency by at least 2
percent a year over the next eight years while cutting the nation's carbon
emissions to 2005 levels by 2020.</P>
      <P>With the 18 projects, the MOEA will establish a new energy recycling mechanism,
encouraging the public to use small energy recycling facilities and expanding
the collection of wind power from land-based generators to offshore generators.</P>
      <P>As for low-carbon communities, the ministry has set a goal of developing two
model communities each in 25 cities and counties, for a total of 50, before the
end of 2011.</P>
      <P>Four cities will be developed into low-carbon cities by 2014, according to the
MOEA.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, Taiwan will adopt energy efficiency grading systems for air
conditioners, refrigerators and automobiles, the ministry said.</P>

      <P>The Taiwan Railway Administration (TRA) and a leading online travel agency
unveiled on Friday a number of new train tour packages they have put together to
explore Taiwan, including a seven-day luxury tour of the island that will cost
NT$70,000 (US$2,215).</P>
      <P>The seven-day package will take travelers to Taroko Gorge in Hualien, the Bunun
aboriginal community in Taitung, Taiwan's ancient capital of Tainan, Kenting in
southern Taiwan, and Sun Moon Lake and will put them up at six five-star hotels
along the way.</P>
      <P>Special attendants will be on board the train to provide assistance to
passengers and serve them local delicacies, such as Donghe meat buns from
Taitung, "Chou's" shrimp rolls from Tainan, and steamed red bean cake favored by
the late first lady Soong Mei-ling, according to Jack Yo, president of travel
agency ezTravel.</P>
      <P>With airfares to overseas destinations on the rise, Yo said many people are
choosing to travel around Taiwan, with a growing number opting for the tourism
train.</P>
      <P>The TRA launched the tourism train with ezTravel in 2001, initially targeting
only eastern and southern Taiwan. But it later evolved into more varied
offerings that connect all parts of the island.</P>
      <P>At present, the cheapest "Formosa Star" tour is a one-day tour of Taroko Gorge,
costing NT$1,999.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan's export competitiveness on decline: official</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 9 (CNA)
04/09/10  17:49:35
(By Lin Shu-yuan and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's export competitiveness has been on a steady decline over the past nine
years in comparison with its major trade competitors, a senior Ministry of
Economic Affairs (MOEA) official said Friday.</P>
      <P>Citing government statistics, Deputy Minister of Economic Affairs Lin Sheng-
chung said Taiwan posted an average annual growth of 7 percent in exports to the
10 member states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) between
2001 and 2009, far lower than South Korea's 9.4 percent and China's 23.1
percent.</P>
      <P>In terms of amount, Lin said, Taiwan's shipments to the 10 ASEAN states doubled
during the nine-year period, lagging behind South Korea's 2.5-times growth, Lin
added.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks after the Liberty Times, a local daily, said in the front-
page report that same day that Taiwan's export figures for the first quarter of
this year seemed to be a slap in the face for the administration of President Ma
Ying-jeou.</P>
      <P>While the Ma administration has repeatedly claimed that if Taiwan fails to sign
an economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) with China, it will be
marginalized after the formation of the ASEAN Plus One (China) free trade area,
the paper said Taiwan's Q1 exports remained robust, with the amount reaching
US$61.8 billion -- the second highest in history for the same period.</P>
      <P>Moreover, it said, Taiwan's exports to six of the major ASEAN member states
amounted to US$9.04 billion in Q1, which was also the second highest in Taiwan-
ASEAN trade history. Taiwan's Q1 shipments to China and Hong Kong as a whole
even set a new quarterly record of US$26.42 billion.</P>
      <P>All these figures point to the strength and resilience of Taiwan's economy even
after the formation of the ASEAN Plus One at the beginning of this year,
according to the paper.</P>
      <P>In response, Lin said that trade competitiveness rather than export figures
better reflects Taiwan's true economic situation in the global macroeconomy.</P>
      <P>"The annual growth rate only measures one's own performance in different
periods...  We should compare with others to better understand our actual
strength," Lin explained.</P>
      <P>According  to him,  Taiwan is actually  losing its export competitiveness
because of its lack of access to regional economic integration.</P>
      <P>In contrast, A South Korea-ASEAN free trade agreement (FTA) covering goods took
effect in June 2007 and a similar agreement covering services came into force in
May 2009.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the ASEAN-Japan Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement took
effect in December 2008, while the ASEAN Plus China free trade area was
inaugurated Jan. 1 this year.</P>
      <P>To sum up, Lin said, ASEAN, Japan, South Korea and China have signed FTAs to
boost their economic exchanges and cooperation. These developments have taken a
toll on Taiwan's trade competitiveness, he argued, adding that Taiwan needs to
conclude an ECFA deal with China to facilitate its trade expansion and sustain
its economic growth.</P>
      <P>The proposed ECFA is seen as a scaled-back FTA and Taiwan's government hopes
that its FTA talks with other countries will become easier after the ECFA is
signed with China.</P>
      <P>China still claims  sovereignty  over Taiwan,  but the Ma administration's modus
vivendi diplomatic approach has contributed to significant improvements in
cross-strait relations in the last couple of years, giving optimism to the
prospects of signing a cross-strait ECFA and FTAs with other trade partners.</P>

      <P>The Presidential Office on Friday challenged opposition Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen to come up with its own economic strategy to
deal with the crisis of Taiwan being marginalized.</P>
      <P>Presidential Office spokesman Lo Chih-chiang said Tsai has led the party for two
years but has so far said nothing about how to address the crisis.</P>
      <P>If Tsai is opposed  to a proposed  cross-strait  economic cooperation framework
agreement (ECFA), she should clearly explain her "constructive alternative," Lo
said.</P>
      <P>The spokesman wondered how Tsai would cope with the problem of lower tariffs on
the trade of goods between other countries and China as free trade blocs and
global free trade agreements take hold, hurting Taiwan's exports and
contributing to its marginalization.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, Tsai criticized President Ma Ying-jeou for his insistence
since 2008 that signing the agreement with China was a necessity and said that
the opposition had yet to obtain any comprehensive information regarding its
details.</P>
      <P>She asked to have access to the early harvest list proposed by the  government,
the  draft  of  the  agreement   and government-commissioned ECFA assessment
reports.</P>
      <P>But Lo said the request by the DPP for more information before a scheduled TV
debate between Ma and Tsai April 25 was unwarranted, saying that all of the
information has appeared in previous policy presentations and is open to
everybody.</P>
      <P>President Ma has instructed the Mainland Affairs Council and the Ministry of
Economic Affairs to provide the information.</P>
      <P>On the DPP's request for information on the ongoing negotiations, Lo said that
Tsai, as an experienced negotiator, "should know that if information from an
ongoing negotiation is recklessly made public, the damage to the negotiating
process will be great."</P>

      <P>Workers at restaurants, seafood stores or certified traditional markets may kill
fowl or fish by placing them in boiling water, but do so as part of a public
performance is illegal, a Council of Agriculture official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Animal Industry Department Director Hsu Kuei-sen made the remarks in response to
questions about a hotel in Taipei County that was fined NT$100,000  (US$3,170)
after a chef from China gave a demonstration  called "stewing a chicken in three
minutes" at a promotional event March 21.</P>
      <P>The chef, Zhang Xiaochun, killed the chicken by placing it in boiling water
before plucking it and continuing the cooking process.</P>
      <P>The performance drew protests from the Environment and Animal Society of Taiwan,
which denounced the killing as animal abuse.</P>
      <P>The county government fined the hotel for violating the Animal Industry Act,
which stipulates that slaughtering can only be performed at certified
slaughterhouses,  traditional markets or private homes.</P>
      <P>Tsai Kuang-jung, director of the county's Agriculture Bureau, told reporters
that the public killing showed no respect for life.</P>
      <P>The Environment and Animal Society of Taiwan said the case raises questions
about whether cooking live fish at seafood restaurants also violates the law.</P>
      <P>In response to the disputes, Hsu said the hotel was punished because it
conducted the slaughter at a public show.</P>
      <P>Hsu added that while humans may not be able to get rid of the habit of eating
meat, it is better to cook in "a humane way" to show respect for life.</P>

      <P>Televisions featuring 3D technology drew a mixed response from visitors at a
computer show in Taipei Friday as experts considered a lack of content to be one
of the major barriers to the devices' popularity.</P>
      <P>Softex Taipei, which opened Thursday and runs until April 12, features  a wide
variety  of electronics  products,  including smartphones, LED monitors,
e-readers and digital cameras.</P>
      <P>Visitors lined up to see the latest in 3D technology for TVs, with Samsung
showcasing its first 3D LED TV, which will soon be available in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"It is the first time consumers in Taiwan have seen the Samsung C7000 3D LED TV,
which is due to hit the local market in early May, " the South Korean company
said in a press statement.</P>
      <P>"More than 500 people gave a positive response to Samsung's 3D TV on the first
day of the show," said Mandy Kao of Samsung.</P>
      <P>To cope with the lack of 3D content, Samsung provides a technology that allows
viewers to experience a simulated 3D effect on its 3D TV when watching a 2D
film, she added.</P>
      <P>Sony Taiwan set up a showroom in which visitors could wear 3D glasses while
watching a U.S. animated film. Sony is scheduled to release its 3D TV in Taiwan
in June.</P>
      <P>However, several people were dissatisfied with their viewing experience.</P>
      <P>A group of students told CNA that the 3D effect was not as good as they had
expected.</P>
      <P>"It made me a bit dizzy," a girl said.</P>
      <P>Another visitor, a middle-aged man surnamed Chen, complained that the images are
"shaky."</P>
      <P>"I also felt a sense of oppressiveness," he added.</P>
      <P>Taking into consideration the quality and the price, which is much higher than
that of a traditional TV, Chen said he would not buy a 3D TV at the moment.</P>
      <P>"If you buy a 3D TV, what are you going to watch on it? There are very few 3D
movies, " said Danny Yao, managing director of BenQ Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Kevin Fang, a senior executive at LG Electronics Taiwan, agreed that there is a
lack of content and that the 3D TVs are impractical.</P>
      <P>"Right now, these companies seem to be demonstrating that they are capable of
developing 3D technology," he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DOH urged to improve health insurance financial management</HEADLINE>

      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) should improve its financial management of the
national health insurance program to keep the system afloat and save taxpayers
money, the Consumers' Foundation said Friday.</P>
      <P>The foundation made the appeal a day after the Executive Yuan passed a package
of draft amendments to the National Health Insurance Act that will pave the way
for a second-generation health insurance program, which is expected to be in
place by 2012 at the earliest.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a news conference, Consumers Foundation Chairman Hsieh Tien-jen said
the DOH's Bureau of National Health Insurance (BNHI) needed to improve its
financial management, which he said partly accounted for the system's NT$58.8
billion (US$1.86 billion) accumulated deficit as of the end of 2009.</P>
      <P>Hsieh took particular aim at the simplified form used by health care
institutions to claim reimbursements for drug expenses, which he called a "black
hole."</P>
      <P>He advocated scrapping the simplified form, which exempts clinics and hospitals
from itemizing claims for prescription drugs if the unit price of the drug falls
below a specified amount.</P>
      <P>Previously, the amount was set at NT$25 but was cut to NT$22 at the end of
March. The BNHI said the reduction will bring down its annual drug reimbursement
by an estimated NT$1.2 billion.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said, however, that such a reduction was too limited to be acceptable
because according to information provided by state-run hospitals, the actual
cost for many drugs is only about NT$7 apiece.</P>
      <P>That means that an annual "black hole" of NT$7.2 billion could exist in the drug
reimbursement system, he said, figuring that if an NT$3 drop in the unit price
needed to itemize costs could save NT$1.2 billion, then an NT$18 drop from NT$25
to NT$7 could save NT$7.2 billion.</P>
      <P>Hsieh argued that despite the recent adjustment, an unplugged "black hole" of
NT$6 billion still remained, and he urged the bureau to end the practice of
allowing non-itemized  claims for the reimbursement of drug expenses.</P>
      <P>He also urged the bureau to improve the function of the health system's IC cards
to prevent patients from securing the same medications at different health care
facilities for the same health condition.</P>
      <P>Hsieh contended that it would be extremely unfair if the bureau failed to do its
best to prevent the waste of medical resources at a time when it is raising
health premium rates.</P>
      <P>To temporarily cover the health insurance system's deficit before the second
generation program takes effect, the DOH recent raised health insurance premium
rates from the previous 4.55 percent to 5.17 percent, effective April 1.</P>
      <P>But only those whose earnings base on which premiums are calculated exceeds
NT$40,100 per month will actually pay more. The government plans to subsidize
the hikes of lower income individuals.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NTU announces breakthrough in using MRIs to detect tumors</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>National Taiwan University (NTU) announced Friday that it has developed a method
that will enhance the ability of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) devices to
accurately detect tumors and identify them a week earlier than would be possible
through a traditional approach.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a news conference to unveil the finding, Dennis W. Hwang, an
assistant professor at National Chung Cheng University who took part in the
study, said the NTU team and its collaborators optimized MRI tumor contrast
enhancement  by improving "active feedback" techniques.</P>
      <P>According to Hwang, the techniques make it easier for doctors to detect the
difference between smaller and larger objects and possibly better differentiate
between lesions and surrounding tissues.</P>
      <P>In their experiments, Hwang said, this imaging method helped doctors more
precisely and more quickly detect tumors in mice that were injected with cells
of malignant tumors from humans.</P>
      <P>MRIs produce a signal that can be detected by the scanner based on the
difference in energy between when the electromagnetic field in the device is
turned on and turned off. Normally, however, the images can lack clarity because
of the decay of the signals.</P>
      <P>Hwang's team used an active feedback enhanced MRI technique that limited the
decay by manipulating the sound signals and bouncing them off each other to
amplify them to a contrast four times sharper than using traditional methods.</P>
      <P>The technique permitted doctors to precisely determine the size and location of
a two millimeter cancerous tumor that had grown in a mouse in one week, Hwang
said.</P>
      <P>If the technique can be used on humans, Hwang said it could dramatically reduce
examination fees for cancer patients. enditem/ls @ @</P>

      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) will not oppose amending the law to prevent its
senior staff from taking jobs at pharmaceutical plants or medical institutions
within a specified period after retirement, an official said Friday.</P>
      <P>DOH Minister Yaung Chih-liang made the remarks in response to an appeal by the
Consumers' Foundation earlier in the day that a "revolving door" clause be
introduced to block senior DOH officials from taking positions at health care-
related institutions within three years following their retirement from public
services.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a news conference, Consumers' Foundation Chairman Hsieh Tien-jen
said a lot of DOH officials have taken up important positions at medical
institutions or pharmaceutical companies shortly after stepping down from
department posts.</P>
      <P>Among them are two former DOH ministers, Hou Sheng-mao and Lin Fang-yu, who now
head Shin Kong Wu Ho-Su Memorial Hospital and Taipei Veterans General Hospital,
respectively.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said that such moves could cause concern that they may illegitimately or
improperly benefit from their new posts due to their links with the DOH.</P>
      <P>In response, Yaung said current law does not have any regulations governing the
post-retirement career choices of DOH officials.</P>
      <P>"If necessary, I would not oppose revising the law to impose some career
restrictions on retired DOH officials to stem speculation or public misgiving,"
he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Control Yuan takes pension fund management to task</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The management of the Public Service Pension Fund is not transparent and its
risk control is lax, according to an investigation conducted by the Control
Yuan, which is in charge of monitoring the behavior of government officials.</P>
      <P>In a report on the investigation presented Friday, the Control Yuan said the
fund, which manages the pensions of nearly 700,000 military personnel, civil
servants and teachers in the nation, lost more than NT$86 billion due to the
global financial crisis in 2008.</P>
      <P>The Control Yuan therefore conducted an investigation after public misgivings
over the safety of the fund's investments.</P>
      <P>Control Yuan member Chao Chang-ping said that between 1999 and 2008, the fund's
portfolio had an average rate of return of minus 4.58 percent and lost more than
NT$48.7 billion.</P>
      <P>The rate was lower than that of Taiwan's weighted stock index average return of
a negative 0.92 percent and far lower than the average rate of return of 2.5
percent had the money been kept in a time deposit over the same period, Chao
said.</P>
      <P>He said the fund management board was trying to rationalize its poor performance
over the long-term by citing the global financial crisis, which he instead
described as a "failure to fulfill its duty of professional investment and
management."</P>
      <P>Also, the public often wonders if the government is "propping up stock prices or
dumping stocks" on the stock market if the fund buys or sells stocks, but Chao
said that "propping up sagging stocks" is not the mission of the pension fund.</P>
      <P>If the fund can formulate a "take-profit point" or "stop-loss point"
quantitative assessment, where specific targets for cutting losses or locking in
profits are set,  it would help dispel speculation about improper intervention
of the fund management board, Chao said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  Tsai Feng-ching,  deputy chairman  of the fund management board,
said Friday that regulations of the fund have followed set procedures, and that
the rate of return of 19.5 percent in 2009 was the highest ever.</P>
      <P>He also dismissed allegations  that the fund was operated privately without
supervision in a "secret room, " saying it was just an ordinary room set up to
trade stocks located on the third floor of the Examination Yuan building.</P>
      <P>The Control Yuan has questioned two former chairmen of the fund management board
-- Chu Wu-shien and Chang Che-shen.</P>
      <P>The report said that Chu had intervened too deeply in the fund's investments and
set up professional equipment on his office desk, which was improper.</P>
      <P>Chu, the former head of the Ministry of Civil Service, contended that he set up
the equipment because he was in charge of the management of the fund and that he
needed to pay attention to it from time to time.</P>

      <P>The National Stabilization Fund earned around NT$25 billion (US$792 million) in
selling off NT$62 billion in shares on Taiwan's stock market between March 1 and
April 9, a financial official said Friday.</P>
      <P>According to the official, who met reporters after a regular meeting of the
fund, the fund racked up NT$21.5 billion in profits in March alone after sales
of shares valued at NT$52 billion. It was the fund's best performance in any
single month in its history.</P>
      <P>During the month-long period, the weighted index, the local bourse's key
indicator, surged to 7,920 from 7,577, he noted. The weighted index closed at
8,092 on Friday.</P>
      <P>The National Stabilization Fund still holds NT$31.1 billion worth in local
shares, with NT$11.1 billion in unrealized profits, the official said, adding
that the fund would sell more shares without affecting the stock market as the
economy regained some momentum.</P>
      <P>The government-run fund bought as much as NT$59.9 billion in shares in September
2009 to stabilize Taiwan's stock exchange after the global financial crisis
erupted.</P>
      <P>The fund has gradually sold the shares it held since the beginning of this year
as the economy improves.</P>
      <P>The fund was established to stabilize volatility in local share prices created
by external factors, but its transactions can also lead to fluctuations in stock
prices.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's private investment totaled NT$386 billion (US$ 12.2 billion) in the
first quarter of the year, the Ministry of Economic Affairs said Friday.</P>
      <P>The amount was 37.57 percent of the private investment target of NT$1.272
trillion (US$43.1 billion) set for the whole of 2010 and bodes well for Taiwan's
ability to move further away from the shadows cast by the 2008-2009 global
financial crisis, the ministry said.</P>
      <P>Noteworthy among all industries was the green energy sector, which attracted
investment worth NT$41.8 billion, amounting to 78 percent of the 2010 target, it
added.</P>
      <P>The government was also on pace to meet its target of having Taiwanese
businesses operating in China and other parts of the world invest NT$38 billion
back in their home country in 2010, after such enterprises injected NT$9.5
billion into Taiwan in the first three months of the year, the ministry said.</P>

      <P>A free trade area formed between China and the Association  of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN)  that was inaugurated Jan. 1 this year has affected Taiwan's
exports, Minister without Portfolio Yiin Chi-min said in a statement released
Friday.</P>
      <P>Yiin was dismissing a report in the Chinese-language Liberty Times newspaper
that said Taiwan's exports to China and ASEAN did not suffer because of ASEAN
plus one after first-quarter exports to the trade area were the second highest
ever recorded for the same period.</P>
      <P>The ASEAN plus China free trade framework agreement was signed in 2002 and
contains an "early harvest" list of products and services for tariff
concessions. In 2004, ASEAN and China signed a further agreement on trade in
goods.</P>
      <P>The tariff reduction process under the FTA was initiated on a full scale long
before the agreement became effective, Yiin noted.</P>
      <P>As an example, Yiin said that Taiwan's shipments to the 10 ASEAN states doubled
between 2001 and 2009, lagging behind Singapore's 1.5-times growth and China's
4.7-times. "How can it be said that the 'ASEAN Plus One' has not affected
Taiwan's exports? " Yiin asked.</P>
      <P>It's unreliable to draw a conclusion based merely on Q1 export figures, Yiin
said.</P>
      <P>Yiin also pointed out that Q1 exports to the six major ASEAN states did not
return to the 2008 level and exports to China barely reached the 2008 level.</P>

(ECFA)  with China,  opposition  Democratic  Progressive  Party (DPP)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>In preparation for the April 25 debate with President Ma Ying-jeou on the
proposed economic cooperation framework agreement Chairperson Tsai Ing-wen
recently requested access to relevant information, including the early harvest
list proposed by the government, the draft of the agreement, and government-
commissioned ECFA assessment reports.</P>
      <P>The request, however, was rejected by the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>As a matter of fact, the Presidential Office, or the ruling Kuomintang,
committed a major strategic mistake: being too attentive to debate details and
being too concerned with its results.</P>
      <P>The Presidential Office probably failed to realize that the upcoming debate is
not one between two presidential candidates, but one between the president and
an opposition leader. As the president, he cannot monopolize national policy to
his advantage. With such an attitude, he may win the debate, but lose the ECFA
battle.</P>
      <P>After resisting exchanges with China for a long time, the DPP finally is trying
to understand the ECFA policy.</P>
      <P>The government should generously provide the DPP with the necessary information
and see this as a rare opportunity for communication. (April 10, 2010)</P>

    <HEADLINE>Talk of the day -- Taiwan's Susan Boyle</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>04/10/10  13:54:51
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A 24-year-old Taiwanese man, Lin Yu-chun, became a hit on the Internet and
conquered the hearts of a big audience with his unique voice after a video
showing him singing Whitney Houston's famous song "I Will Always Love You" was
posted on YouTube.</P>
      <P>Lin's performance on a local talent show "Million Star" was first posted on
YouTube April 6 and he has since become an overnight celebrity on the Web.</P>
      <P>The three major U.S. television networks introduced him as "Taiwan's Susan
Boyle." Invited by several TV stations in the U.S. and Japan to take part in
their programs, Lin has decided to head for the U.S. and have an interview with
comedian George Lopez on his program "Tonight Show."</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from local media coverage of the issue:</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>Lin, who has never been to the U.S., exclaimed: "Oh, my god, It's just like a
dream come true." "I feel that I have been stricken by lightening, and I want to
kneel down and thank the person who posted my video on the Internet," he said.</P>
      <P>Lin became famous around the world overnight. Requests for interviews from local
and foreign media came one after another the very next day. Some paparazzi even
waited for him at the door of his home.</P>
      <P>"I keep telling myself 'calm down' and take it as 'business as usual, '" he said
when asked whether he is afraid of being a flash in the pan.</P>
      <P>In view of some criticism against him, Lin said he can still handle it as he has
taken criticisms so many times in singing competitions since he was a child,
despite objections from his father.</P>
      <P>"I'll give my future to my agent," he said.</P>
      <P>"Fatty (Lin's nickname) will not show up in Taiwan's TV programs, and we will
first market him on the international stage, " his agent said.</P>
      <P>"If Susan Boyle and Paul Potts could become so popular, why not Lin, " the agent
said, adding that "we will make him a phenomenon when he stages a comeback in
Taiwan." (April 10, 2010)</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>Lin Yu-chun, dubbed "Taiwan's version of Susan Boyle, " lost the most recent
race in the "Million Star" program broadcast on April 9 by a Taiwanese TV
station. But he has only found increased interests from foreign media in him. A
program of Japan's Fuji Television Network reportedly will send a host to
interview him in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"We have been contacting several companies in a bid to find someone to release
an album for him," his agent said.</P>
      <P>Lin, a graduate from a university in Taoyuan, now works as a part-timer at a
store that sells musical instruments. Although he has fast surged to fame, he
only earns NT$15,000 (US$470) a month.</P>
      <P>Jacky Wu, a popular entertainer in Taiwan, said he does not believe that Lin
will maintain his current popularity for long.</P>
      <P>"His voice is exceptional and arouse widespread public interest in him but his
looks are ordinary, " Wu contended. "It is not easy to survive in show
business." (April 10, 2010)</P>

    <HEADLINE>Opinions differ on what metaphors to use for cross-Strait relations</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 10 (CNA)
04/10/10  14:38:17
(By Chris Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>While Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao has depicted Taiwan-China relations as a
"brotherhood" in his recent speech, Taiwanese academics and politicians have
also offered their own metaphors for relations across the Taiwan Strait, which
academia said would dictate the future cross-Strait development roadmap.</P>
      <P>Wen used the term "brotherhood"  to describe  cross-Strait relations as early as
2008 and did the same again in the closing press conference of China's National
People's Congress last month.</P>
      <P>Frederick Chien, a senior diplomat who is leading a 39-member Taiwan delegation
to the ongoing Boao Forum for Asia (BFA) in the resort town Boao of China's
southern Hainan province, echoed the same idea.</P>
      <P>"Both sides (Taiwan and China) should be brothers, not enemies, " Chien told the
media in Boao, where he is scheduled to meet with Chinese Vice President Xi
Jinping Saturday.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, President Ma Ying-jeou responded to Wen's comment by sidestepping the
term "brotherhood" and saying that both sides of the strait "belong to one
Chinese nation and are both Chinese people."</P>
      <P>As a political and cultural metaphor, brotherhood in Chinese means that both
sides come from the same family, maintain close and friendly relations, will
help each other and often share the same values.</P>
      <P>Taiwan academia raised similar discussions in a recent forum on cross-Strait
relations  in which scholars presented  different interpretations of their own.</P>
      <P>The metaphorical interpretation of cross-strait relations is important, they
agreed, because it would reveal and dictate the Taiwanese government's China
policy.</P>
      <P>Chang Ya-chung,  a political scientist  at National Taiwan University, agreed
with the "brotherhood" description and said that "relations of brotherhood can
be uneven, but must be equal."</P>
      <P>In comparison, he described China-Hong Kong relations as "father and son" and
interpreted cross-strait relations in President Ma's "Chinese people theory" as
"cousins."</P>
      <P>Chang advocates a "One China, Three Constitutions" theory which calls for
eventual cross-strait integration. Wen's comment, he said, was like "an
opportunity of a lifetime" to promote integration as "China's interior affairs."</P>
      <P>The pro-independence opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) always views
cross-strait relations as relations between "friends" or "neighbors, " Chang
said.</P>
      <P>Even some of the heavyweight Taiwan independence supporters accepted the
"brotherhood" theory, such as former presidential advisor Koo Kuan-min, who has
voiced support for the idea and said that it would be fine if China views itself
as the big brother, but then it has to look after the kid brother -- Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Political scientist Tang Shao-cheng argued that the brotherhood theory will be
difficult to carry out because no one knows who is going to be the big brother.
The neighborhood theory, he added, is more practical.</P>
      <P>Huang Guangguo, a professor at National Taiwan University, brought up an idea
submitted by Chinese academia that described Taiwan and China as different
halves of a planet in a political solar system, in which every planet was seen
as a country.</P>
      <P>The brotherhood theory could result in misunderstanding for foreign countries,
said Gunter Schubert, a visiting research fellow of Academia Sinica's Institute
of Sociology who came from the University of Turbingen, Germany.</P>
      <P>The (brotherhood) theory suggests that it is a family matter unrelated to the
outside world, Schubert said, adding that it would be better to promote
integration from the stand point of "friends" so that it's easier for foreigners
to understand.</P>
      <P>The neighborhood theory basically means Taiwan and China are unrelated entities,
which marks the regression of Taiwan-China relations and is exactly what the DPP
wants, Chang said.</P>
      <P>In terms of cross-strait relations, it's obvious that the most important
phenomenon at present is the lack of trust between the two sides, Ho Szu-shen, a
professor at Fu Jen Catholic University, observed.</P>
      <P>"Without trust, any theory wouldn't work, " he said.</P>
      <P>Joseph Wu, a political scientist at National Chengchi University who served
during the DPP administration as chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC)
-- Taiwan's top China policy-making body -- and Taiwan's representative to the
United States, said that regardless of theories, it's important to consider the
possibility of the DPP returning to power.</P>
      <P>American and Japanese authorities and academia have both urged the DPP to review
and revise its party platform and resolution, which contains support for Taiwan
independence, Wu said.</P>
      <P>While the DPP always calls for a peaceful co-existence with China and is
believed to respect all the documents and agreements signed during the ruling
Kuomintang (KMT) administration once it returns to power, it's not likely to
accept the "One China Principle" and the "1992 consensus, " he said.</P>

      <P>As heads of the delegations from the two sides of the Taiwan Strait attending
the Boao Forum for Asia 2010 prepared to meet Saturday, Taiwanese delegate Chiu
Cheng-hsiung said the meeting helps future exchanges between the two sides.</P>
      <P>Chiu, chairman of the Taiwan-based Bank SinoPac, previously served as a vice
premier in President Ma Ying-jeou's administration. He told CNA before attending
the forum's opening ceremony that day that it is a good place for the two sides
to get to know each other better and to exchange opinions.</P>
      <P>The Taiwanese delegation is led by Fredrick Chien, a former president of the
Control Yuan, and is composed of members of banking companies and financial
institutes. The group's presence is expected to help boost cross-strait banking
exchanges.</P>
      <P>Chiu said the two sides will discuss financial exchanges in detail during talks
on a proposed cross-strait economic cooperation framework agreement. "No matter
what the results might be, it will be better for cross-strait financial
exchanges," he said.</P>
      <P>He noted that Taiwan is overflowing with funds that should be properly led to
overseas markets such as China. Taiwan could provide loans to Taiwanese
businesses there through credit rating and credit checks, he suggested</P>
      <P>Taiwan's financial sector, which is experienced in supporting small- and medium-
sized enterprises, could also lend its experience in this area to China, Chiu
added.</P>
      <P>Chiu was also expected to attend a meeting later that day between Chien and
Chinese Vice President Xi Jinping, who is heading the Chinese delegation at the
forum.</P>
      <P>Other Taiwanese delegates who are to attend the meeting include Cathay Financial
Holdings Chairman Tsai Hong-tu, Fubon Financial Holdings Chairman Daniel Tsai,
and Schive Shih, chairman of the Taiwan Stock Exchange.</P>
      <P>The Boao Forum, founded in 2001 by Australia and 25 Asian states, has held its
annual meeting in Boao since 2002 to promote high-level dialogue on regional
issues.</P>
      <P>The theme of this year's three-day meeting is "Green Recovery: Asia's Realistic

    <DATELINE>04/10/10  15:37:19
(By Y.F.  Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>In an upcoming debate between President  Ma Ying-jeou and opposition Democratic
Progressive Party Chairperson Tsai Ing-wen on the proposed economic cooperation
framework agreement (ECFA) , they will have the responsibility of pulling the
politicized issue back to the economic sphere where it belongs.</P>
      <P>Here are some suggestions for the two leaders.</P>
      <P>First, they should avoid making their value judgments absolute because the
advantages and disadvantages of the future ECFA will be relative, not absolute.</P>
      <P>Second, they should discuss more about medium- and long-term plans and tell the
people how the ECFA will relate to Taiwan's medium- and long-term development.
It will be necessary for Ma, who advocates the agreement, to explain in detail
what substantive measures his administration will take after the pact is signed,
and what their expected effects will be.</P>
      <P>Third, they should dissociate the ECFA issue from the year-end mayoral elections
in the five special municipalities. Under pressure over the elections, both the
blue and green camps are keen on manipulating the ECFA issue to their advantage.
This has been one of the main reasons why the simple issue has been politicized
and has lost its focus.</P>
      <P>If the ECFA issue is restored to its original state, we will discover something
forgotten: the ECFA is economic in nature, mutually beneficial to both sides of
the Taiwan Strait, and related to the World Trade Organization.</P>
      <P>Taiwan should avoid the disadvantages and try to maximize the benefits. It must
not miss an opportunity for development because of a fight over whether the ECFA
is "black or white."</P>

    <HEADLINE>Invitations for `Taiwan's Susan Boyle' keep flowing in</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Invitations for Lin Yu-chun, a local talent show winner who has been described
as "Taiwan's Susan Boyle" -- a British KTV singer who achieved celebrity after
winning a British talent show -- have been flooding in from Japan, the United
States and South Korea, the staff of a local talent training school said
Saturday.</P>
      <P>A-List Entertainment, a company that produces top singers, stars, models and
entertainers, said they had been inundated by calls looking for Lin.</P>
      <P>The invitations included those from three major U.S. TV groups, asking for
interviews and performances from Lin.</P>
      <P>Lin became an Internet hit after his performance of "I Will Always Love You" on
local talent show " Million Star" was posted on YouTube April 6.</P>
      <P>Before his overnight celebrity, however, the 24-year-old Lin endured slights for
four years,  according to his mentor Hsu Nai-chung, better known by his nickname
"Blue."</P>
      <P>In 2006, both Lin and Blue's daughter took part in a music competition,  winning
in the creative  and singing categories, respectively.</P>
      <P>They later signed a six-year contract with an agency, which is how Blue, who is
also president of the Pure Music company, got to know Lin.</P>
      <P>Blue saw Lin's potential and thought his ability to sing in a girlish falsetto,
as well as his fleshy and baby-faced appearance, made him stand out.</P>
      <P>Blue therefore coached Lin, hoping to lead him on the path to being a
professional singer.</P>
      <P>Under Blue's encouragement, Lin took part in several local TV talent shows, but
failed to draw attention. In addition, his agency failed to support him and
poured cold water on his desire to take part in TV talent shows.</P>
      <P>Lin finally terminated his contract with the agency last year and enrolled in
A-List Entertainment last October.</P>
      <P>His rendering of Whitney Houston's song "I Will Always Love You" has spread fast
across the Internet, enabling him to taste the sweetness of success for the
first time.</P>
      <P>Listening to Lin sing another Houston's signature song, "Saving All My Love for
You," some people might get the idea why he is called the "male Whitney Houston,
" with his "near exact" rendition of the Houston original.</P>
      <P>Blue said Lin might sound like a sissy, but pointed out that this is perfect for
his singing style.</P>
      <P>According to Blue, Lin's voice is also ideal for one of the greatest jazz
singers of all time -- Ella Fitzgerald.</P>
      <P>He said he also plans to nurture Lin as a "creative" singer.</P>
      <P>Lin, who is 171-cm and weights 110 kg, said that he has been called "fat" since
his childhood and that he used to care very much about his obesity, but now " I
can live and be happy with my appearance."</P>

    <HEADLINE>Late Italian priest's cultural legacy still felt in Hakka community</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>04/10/10  16:10:10</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>When James Hsu, a young Hakka man from Pingtung County, was performing his
alternative military service in Hsinchu County by helping to renovate a church
seven years ago, little did he know that his entire existence would be reshaped
by the late priest who created it.</P>
      <P>It was working on the church -- built by the late Italian Jesuit missionary
Guerrino Marsecano in 1965 -- that he learned of a unique book, a 627-page
English-Hakka dictionary compiled by Marsecano and a group of editors, that left
him full of admiration.</P>
      <P>"Even Hakka people might not have been able to put together such a great
dictionary, " marvels Hsu, who said it even went as far as listing different
Hakka pronunciations for the same word to reflect linguistic differences within
the various Hakka communities in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Hsu's passion for a man he never met -- Marsecano died in 2000 -- is indicative
of the power of the Jesuit priest's legacy among the Hakka people, one that
remains especially evident in Hukou Township, where the church is a major
landmark and tourist draw.</P>
      <P>The church, which boasts exotic architecture manifesting the influence of the
Italian priest, is located at the entrance of the Hukou Old Street --  one of
the must-see attractions in the traditionally Hakka community.</P>
      <P>The church site had historical significance even before Marsecano appeared on
the scene. It housed the Da Hukou railway station on Taiwan's first railway
line, a 106.7-km line connecting Keelung and Hsinchu that was built in 1885.</P>
      <P>But the station was abandoned in 1929 by the Japanese who then colonized the
island because its location on a hillside made it difficult for steam
locomotives to reach.</P>
      <P>After the church was built in 1965, it was home to religious services for nearly
three decades, with Marsecano delivering Mass in Hakka there in its early years
before he was transferred to another parish in Hsinchu County's Guansi Township.</P>
      <P>The church gradually lost its pull, however, and was forced to shut down in 1993
because of the declining congregation and number of children attending the
church-affiliated kindergarten.</P>
      <P>In 2001, the residents decided to renovate the church as part of a project to
revive the 300 meter-long Old Street, lined with two-story Minnan-style red
brick houses noteworthy for their baroque porches.</P>
      <P>The church was converted into a center for local art and culture and an
exhibition hall featuring Catholic missionary history in the Hsinchu area, where
the English-Hakka dictionary, a prime example of the Italian priest's
dedication, is displayed.</P>
      <P>Published in 1959 by Kuangchi Press (now called Kuangchi Cultural Group) , it
contains the Hakka equivalents for 13,721 English words and 20,000 English
phrases.</P>
      <P>Father Wang Wen-lin, director of the Old Hukou Church Museum, said the "great
book" had actually been forgotten for a long time until he and other community
residents recovered it from dusty relics left behind in the church as they were
cleaning it before it was renovated.</P>
      <P>He was thankful the volume was found, and he praised Marsecano's immersion into
Hakka culture.</P>
      <P>"When a foreigner knows the Hakka dialect so deeply, it means that the person
has treated Hakka villages as his home, " Wang said.</P>
      <P>Touched by the Italian missionary's devotion to fitting into the Hakka way of
life, Hsu was inspired by the church and the dictionary to learn more about the
priest.</P>
      <P>Marsecano, born in 1915 in Ferentino in the Italian province of Frosinone, came
to Taiwan in 1955 from the Philippines. He had been stationed in China but was
expelled by the communists before traveling to the Philippine province of
Iloilo.</P>
      <P>After he arrived in Taiwan, the Jesuit missionary was posted to the parish in
Hukou.</P>
      <P>Hsu thoroughly researched Marsecano's life in Taiwan and then traveled around
Italy for 80 days on a "dream trip" sponsored by the Council for Hakka Affairs
in 2005, visiting schools Marsecano once attended in his home country and
meeting with his sister Vittorina, who is a Jesuit nun.</P>
      <P>He brought documents related to Marsecano's life in Taiwan to Vittorina -- the
only member of Marsecano's family who is still living -- and in return received
a big hug and the nun's heartfelt gratitude for his work, Hsu said.</P>
      <P>At that moment he felt it was worth making the effort to find out even more
about the priest, described by Hsu as a man with a big heart and love for the
world.</P>
      <P>After tracing Marsecano's steps in Taiwan and Italy, Hsu said his next plan is
to fly to Iloilo to track down the priest's legacy there, but the 31-year-old
Hsu said he has already learned an important lesson from the Italian missionary
he never met.</P>
      <P>"There are many possibilities in life. Even if something is not perfect, as long
as you make an effort you will reap rewards, " he said. CNA photos Nos. 24, 25

      <P>The proposed second-generation National Health Insurance program has recently
sparked doubts that it will "punish singles" because single individuals will
have to pay higher premiums. Stopping short of giving a proper explanation,
Department of Health Minister Yaung Chih-liang and Premier Wu Den-yih instead
encouraged people to get married and start families soon.</P>
      <P>It seems the way of thinking of our government officials is too "singular" and
out of sync with reality.</P>
      <P>The government must recognize the changes going on in society and accept that
staying single is one of the options for life. With regard to the distribution
of social resources, the government should give equal treatment to all options
and family types and should not discriminate against any of them.</P>
      <P>Japan, for example, has seen the trend in which more people are choosing to stay
single and has introduced residential projects for singles as part of its long-
term care policy.</P>
      <P>For a long time, our government has been advocating family values and passing
caregiving responsibilities to families to make up for the deficiencies in the
social welfare and care system. However, while the government can compel single
individuals to pay higher premiums by law, should singles have to tie the knot
in a hurry just so that they can pay less premiums?</P>

will lead a delegation that will open an office in Taipei May 7.</P>
      <P>TSTA officials noted that based on an agreement signed between the Straits
Exchange Foundation (SEF) and its Chinese counterpart, the Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Straits, on Chinese tourists traveling to Taiwan,
the TSTA and the CSTA agreed that tourism offices should be set up on each side
to provide quick, convenient and effective services.</P>
      <P>The TSTA and the CSTA started negotiations more than a year ago and had
originally planned to open the offices late last year.</P>
      <P>Tourism  operators  said they were happy  with the latest development,
describing it as a "major event" in cross-strait tourism.</P>
      <P>They noted that since Taiwan began allowing military veterans to return to China
to visit their families in 1987, cross-strait tourism has boomed.</P>
      <P>The number of people traveling to China to visit family, for tourism or for
business has increased every year to more than 3 million, accounting for half of
the outbound visits.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Number covered by national pension system drops to new low</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  10 (CNA)
04/10/10  17:51:35

    <TEXT>
      <P>The number of people covered by the national pension system had declined to 4.01
million as of the end of 2009, 26,000 fewer than that when the system was
launched in 2008 as part of the national welfare network, according to
government statistics.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the issue, Vice Minister of the Interior Chien Tai-lang said
Saturday that the drop was because some of the insured dropped out and turned
instead to labor or farmer insurance schemes.</P>
      <P>"People are free to pay into the insurance scheme that is most beneficial for
them," Chien noted.</P>
      <P>The national pension system was designed for those aged between 25 and 64 years
old and who are not covered by public functionary insurance, labor insurance or
any other publicly sponsored insurance schemes.</P>
      <P>The insured, who pay 60 percent of the premiums while the government covers the
remaining 40 percent, are entitled to receive pensions depending on how long
they have been covered when they turn 65.</P>
      <P>The national pension system completed the country's social insurance network
after it took effect Oct. 1, 2008, said Huang Pi-hsia, director of the
Department of Social Affairs under the Ministry of the Interior (MOI).</P>
      <P>Under the network, people can choose their insurance scheme based on their
vocational status. Should they become jobless, they will be automatically
classified as insured under the national pension system, Huang said.</P>
      <P>Asked about those who are forced to drop out of the insurance system because
they cannot afford to pay the premiums, Huang said the government provides
subsidies for those whose "incomes are below standard."</P>
      <P>According to MOI statistics, the 4.1 million insured, including the jobless,
street vendors,  housekeepers, naturalized foreign spouses and students older
than 25, account for 29.4 percent of the country's population aged between 25
and 64.</P>
      <P>More women than men have joined the national pension system at a percentage of
52.5 percent, while the average age of insured females is 44.4 years, higher
than the 43.9 for men, the tallies show.</P>
      <P>Nearly 1.03 million of the insured received a total of NT$37.7 billion in
payments from the national pension system in 2009, the ministry said.</P>

      <P>The Atomic Energy Council (AEC) said Saturday that it conducts random checks on
tiles sold locally every season and that there is no need for the public to
worry about their safety.</P>
      <P>The AEC made  the remarks  one day after  domestic  tile manufacturers went to
the legislature to call attention to claims that the government has been
allowing substandard Chinese tiles to enter Taiwan via Vietnam and Indonesia.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Ceramic Industries Association has estimated Taiwan's tile market to
be worth about NT$25 billion a year, with tiles from China now accounting for 40
percent of the figure.</P>
      <P>Lin Chin-tsai, secretary-general of the association, also said the Chinese tiles
are not examined, are uneven and break easily. He also claimed that they could
have high radioactivity.</P>
      <P>However, the AEC pointed out that it conducts random checks on tiles every
season and that they come from Taiwan, Turkey, Spain, Thailand, Italy, Vietnam
and Indonesia, as well as various other countries.</P>
      <P>The test results show that the tiles fall within 0.07 mSv/h and 0.09 mSv/h, well
within the tolerance level for radioactivity, so that there is no need for
concern.</P>
      <P>"The council will continue to conduct checks on tiles to ensure public safety,"
the AEC said.</P>

      <P>A group of around 300 sufferers of Parkinson's disease from around Taiwan went
on an outing in the central county of Nantou Saturday to mark the April 11 World
Parkinson's Day.</P>
      <P>The participants, some of whom are confined to a wheelchair, gathered in the
Chung Hsing New Village for a walk despite their movement disorders, while
others went cycling.</P>
      <P>Tseng Kuo-hsiu, a 47-year-old who has suffered from the disease for 19 years,
said he began cycling as a form of exercise two years ago after taking part in a
cycling activity held by a patient support group in Kaohsiung City.</P>
      <P>According to Tseng, cycling is a very suitable exercise for Parkinson's
sufferers because it helps strengthen the muscles as well as increasing physical
strength and willpower.</P>
      <P>While medication can control and relieve the tremors that are a symptom of the
disease, cycling can improve and even prevent them from worsening, he said.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Tulip Movement Disorders Association, the organizer of the activity,
said the outing was aimed at allowing patients to share their life experiences
with each other and encouraging them to bravely overcome their disabilities.</P>
      <P>The event was also a warm-up for an international conference on Parkinson's
disease to be held in March 2011 in Taipei, which is expected to draw more than
1,000 participants, the association added.</P>

      <P>The Consumers Foundation urged local air carriers Saturday to come up with
bolder fare cuts on cross-Taiwan Strait flights amid widespread complaints about
the high cost of air travel between Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>Foundation  Chairman  Hsieh  Tian-jen  said  that  although Taipei-based China
Airlines (CAL) , Trans Asia and EVA Airways have recently  announced  fare cuts
of up to 20 percent on their cross-strait flights, they are only reductions in
the face values of the tickets.</P>
      <P>He reiterated that the price cuts should be reflected in the actual retail price
to the customer.</P>
      <P>According to Hsieh, many China-based Taiwanese businessmen are still
dissatisfied that a round-trip Taiwan-Shanghai flight cost over NT$20,000
(US$640) in early April. The price was much higher than that offered by travel
agencies late last year, he noted.</P>
      <P>He prodded the Civil Aeronautics Administration  (CAA)  to intervene in
airlines' pricing, saying that they should not be left on their own to set
prices in the particularly  oligopolistic cross-strait air travel market.</P>
      <P>At present, only Taiwanese and Chinese carriers can conduct non-stop direct
flights across the strait.</P>
      <P>On April 7, both CAL and Trans Asia announced 20 percent fare cuts on direct
cross -strait economy flights from April 16. Trans Asia plies the Taipei-
Shanghai and Taichung-Shanghai routes, while CAL offers direct flights from
Taoyuan and Kaohsiung to Shanghai, Beijing, Guangzhou and Shenzhen.</P>
      <P>EVA Airways followed suit the next day, announcing reductions ranging between 11
percent and 20 percent on its economy flights from Taiwan to the same four
Chinese cities.</P>
      <P>Sources familiar with the business, however, contended that the price cuts were
more a symbolic gesture than a substantial move.</P>
      <P>They said the cuts will have no real effect on popular flights in the coming
summer peak season and over the period of the 2010 Shanghai World Expo, because
tickets are already fully booked.</P>
      <P>The Fair Trade Commission also said the CAA should come up with more aggressive
measures to push the carriers to reduce their ticket prices further and provide
feedback to their customers.</P>

      <P>Oyster farmers from the western coastal areas of Taiwan staged a protest in
Taipei Saturday  against industrial facilities near their farms that they said
have seriously threatened their operations.</P>
      <P>Lin Lien-tsung, secretary-general of the Fangyuan Anti-Pollution Association in
Changhua, said that an investigative report by Ted Smith, founder of the U.S.,
Silicon Valley Toxics Coalitions, found that the waste water released by panel
makers in Changhua is highly poisonous.</P>
      <P>The 1,000-hectare oyster farms in Changhua's Yungxing, Wanggong, and Hanbou
townships will be highly polluted and even disappear in several years if the
waste water from the Central Taiwan Science Park , which houses many hi-tech
manufactures, continues to be released into the sea through the townships, Lin
added.</P>
      <P>Lin was echoed by Tsai Chia-yang, chairman of the Changhua Oyster Farmers'
Association, who said there are 5,000 hectares of oyster farms in the central
county and that they are now bearing the brunt of the establishment of the
Central Taiwan Science Park.</P>
      <P>Lin Chin-lang, chairman of the Yunlin Offshore Aquaculture Association, said
that the Sixth Naphtha Cracker Project of the Formosa Plastic Group (FPG) has
also ruined oyster farming in neighboring Yunlin County.</P>
      <P>The farmers demanded that the government immediately call to an end the several
ongoing industrial development projects in the coastal area,  including the
Guoguang petrochemical complex in Changhua, the FPG Yunlin cracker, and the
Central Taiwan Science Park sub-projects.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's largest charity foundation called on the public Saturday to practice
"five good deeds a day" to help fight global warming.</P>
      <P>The Buddhist Compassion Relief Tzu Chi Foundation said that the "five good

always carrying three environmentally friendly things (your own cup, bowl and
chopsticks) and walking more.</P>
      <P>The foundation made the appeal at its Pa De environmental protection station in
Taipei. On hand were flood-affected victims from Shanlin Township in Kaohsiung

      <P>The visitors,  who traveled  to Taipei  to express  their appreciation, donned

      <P>The foundation said that according to Wang Chung-ho, a researcher of Academia
Sinica, the nation's highest research institute, if Taiwan is to return to the
1999 carbon dioxide emissions level by 2020, it will have to cut emissions by
least 50 percent.</P>
      <P>What this means is that from now on, emissions should be cut by 5 percent every
year. Based on carbon emissions of 11.17 tons per person per year in Taiwan,
each person must cut their emissions by 1.53 kg per day to achieve the goal.</P>
      <P>In Chinese, the pronunciation of 1.53 sounds similar to "five good deeds a day,

      <P>Taiwan is likely to have its first civil pilot training school in January next
year at the earliest, the country's former top civil aviation official said
Saturday.</P>
      <P>However,  Billy Chang,  who retired as head of the Civil Aeronautics
Administration in 2008, said he has encountered several obstacles so far.</P>
      <P>"I plan to set up the school in Taitung (in eastern Taiwan), but it is very
difficult to acquire land, as the regulations are complex," he said.</P>
      <P>There have been discussions about establishing such a flight school in Taiwan
over the past three decades, but the idea has never come to fruition, he told an
event organized by Privilege Aero LLC, a U.S. pilot training school, to recruit
students in Taipei.</P>
      <P>As a result, local airline companies have to send their pilots abroad to receive
training, he said.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan should be capable of training its own pilots and airplane maintenance
specialists, " noted Chang, who is chairman of the Taipei-based Aviation
Education Foundation.</P>
      <P>He said he had already received funds from a German friend, but still needs to
seek financial sponsorship from local investors, as Taiwanese law sets a limit
on foreign investment.</P>
      <P>Chang estimated that the school would cost NT$3 billion (US$95 million) to NT$4
billion for operations for the first five years.</P>
      <P>He also revealed a plan to recruit 60 professional instructors.</P>
      <P>To get more experience, Chang recently visited four flight schools in the United
States, including Privilege Aero LLC, which was established in 2003 by James
Young, the first Taiwanese founder of a pilot training school in the U.S.</P>
      <P>Young said his school now has more than 100 students, 14 of whom are Taiwanese.</P>
      <P>Chang also lauded Young for inventing a ground-based flight simulator, the only
one of its kind in the world liscensed by the Federal Aviation Administration of
the U.S.</P>
      <P>Young explained that he created the invention after he had to do certain
"dangerous" moves in a real plane when he was receiving his own training at
pilot schools in the U.S.</P>
      <P>"Using this simulator, a student can also take a pause or rewind what he or she

    <TEXT>
      <P>After Department of Health Minister Yaung Chih-liang drew astorm of criticism
for saying single people are more prone to mental illness and should therefore
pay higher health insurance premiums, it is uncertain whether the second-
generation National Health Insurance system will clear the legislature.</P>
      <P>The system would calculate premiums based on household income, allowing single-
income families and those with many dependents to pay less while subjecting
high-income earners and single people to higher premiums.</P>
      <P>The approach has drawn broadsides from various sectors of society, who say it
punishes people for not getting married.</P>
      <P>Yaung should have been more careful in handling the issue, but he continued to
make indiscreet remarks, such as calling for single people who want to pay less
to quickly start families and have more children.</P>
      <P>His comments not only failed to address public concern, but fueled people's
anger at the government and undermined public confidence in the second-
generation health insurance scheme.</P>
      <P>We cannot help but say: Yaung Chih-liang, could you please just shut up?</P>
      <P>The scheme has been designed to raise premiums. Some will have to pay more and
some will be allowed to pay less. The government should give convincing
explanations for the different rates for various groups by citing statistics,
not by making irrelevant comments. (April 11, 2010).</P>

      <P>Taiwan's job market will continue to improve this year as its economy has
recovered from a year-long recession and its 2010 GDP growth is expected to
surpass those of other Asian "little dragons, " Premier Wu Den-yih said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Delivering an address at the opening of a central Taiwan job fair at the
Taichung World Trade Center, Wu cited a recent World Bank assessment as saying
that Taiwan will top the three other Asian "little dragons" in terms of gross
domestic product (GDP) growth this year.</P>
      <P>According to the World Bank report, Taiwan was the "little dragon" hardest-hit
by the 2008-2009 global economic slump, with its 2009 GDP growth rate lagging
behind those of South Korea, Singapore and Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>"The trend will reverse itself this year as the worst is over... Our economy has
weathered the gloom and gradually regained momentum," Wu said.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, Wu said, domestic job prospects have become increasingly
bright, with the number of job openings rising steadily over the past four
months.</P>
      <P>To sustain the momentum, Wu said, the government will work even harder to boost
economic development in collaboration with the private sector in hopes of
creating more jobs and driving the unemployment rate below 5 percent by year's
end.</P>
      <P>More than 200 enterprises in central Taiwan set up booths at the job fair,
offering a total of 14,000 jobs. Another 100-plus companies also commissioned
the fair organizers to help collect resumes from prospective job seekers.</P>
      <P>Wu promised  that the government  will help track private enterprises'
recruitment operations to ensure the event generates the best possible effects
in helping local job seekers land jobs.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Talk of the day -- Boao Forum used to test the waters</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>04/11/10  16:31:51
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Frederick Chien, a retired veteran diplomat leading Taiwan's delegation at the
2010 Boao Forum for Asia in Hainan, met Chinese Vice President Xi Jinping, on
the sidelines of the forum Saturday.</P>
      <P>The forum included nearly 2,000 political and business leaders from around the
world.</P>
      <P>While Chien tested the waters by stressing the importance of closer cross-cross
commercial ties, particularly in the development of green industries and the
financial sector, Xi pushed the signing of a proposed cross-strait economic
cooperation framework agreement (ECFA).</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from local media coverage of the issue:</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>Xi, who is familiar with Taiwan affairs as he had been a deputy mayor of Xiamen
City and a Communist Party of China's No. 2 man in Fujian province -- one of the
Chinese provinces where Taiwanese investments are centered -- spoke with Chien
in his capacity as a Chinese leader for the first time.</P>
      <P>Xi told Chien the signing of the ECFA "should proceed without interruptions and
be allowed to yield positive results and economic efficiency the sooner the
better."</P>
      <P>He said that "all issues can be discussed and all problems can be addressed if
we engage as members of a family."</P>
      <P>He called for closer cooperation across the strait to create a new era of
cooperation now that the global economic meltdown has passed.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Wang Yi, China's top official in charge of Taiwan relations, also
pushed the ECFA signing at a cocktail party to welcome the Taiwan delegation.</P>
      <P>Wang said Taiwan will benefit substantially if cross-strait economic and trade
exchanges become closer and institutionalized.</P>
      <P>"We want to pass more real, positive and objective information about the ECFA to
our Taiwanese compatriots via the Boao forum," Wang said.</P>
      <P>He also stressed that it is time for the two sides to cooperate more closely on
innovation industries.</P>
      <P>Xi and Wang's talks reflect Beijing's stance that it will focus on economic
cooperation with Taiwan and it is not in a hurry to enter into political
negotiations, political analysts said. (April 11, 2010).</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>Xi made positive and constructive comments on the signing of the proposed ECFA.
He called for the two sides to seize opportunities after the global economic
crunch and collaborate to create a "common memory" for both sides.</P>
      <P>Chien, meanwhile, called for closer cross-strait cooperation in the development
of green industries, echoing Xi's remarks during his opening speech.</P>
      <P>Xi had said China is willing to make concerted efforts with its Asian neighbors
to jointly  develop  environmentally  friendly industries that have low carbon
footprints.</P>
      <P>"Once we say it, we mean it and will put it into practice," Xi said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Zhang Xiaoqiang, vice minister of China's National Development and
Reform Commission, said China will encourage foreign investors to make "good
investments" in China and "will no longer welcome  foreign investment  in
energy-  and resource-depleting industries."</P>
      <P>The Boao Forum, founded in 2001 by Australia and 25 Asian states, has held its
annual meeting in the resort town Boao of China's southern Hainan province since
2002 to promote high-level dialogue on regional issues. The theme of this year's
three-day meeting is "Green Recovery: Asia's Realistic Choice for Sustainable
Growth." (April 11, 2010).</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan-designed porcelain assumes new role in people's lives</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>04/11/10  16:57:38</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Franz  Collection  Inc.,  a Taiwan  company  that produces high-quality
porcelain, is renowned for beautiful ceramic art that is popular worldwide and a
favorite gift choice of celebrities in recent years.</P>
      <P>CEO Francis Chen unveiled a new corporate direction recently: Franz will
collaborate with a well-known French company to make porcelain tableware for
hotels, and is planning to bring porcelain into ordinary people's homes.</P>
      <P>The company was founded in 2001 and is primarily known for works that blend
creative design and underlying functionality.</P>
      <P>Franz's tableware, vases and jewelry have won various honors worldwide  such as
the Best in Gift Award  at the New York International Gift Fair in 2002, Best
Ceramic Gift in Britain in 2005, Fashion Accessory Line of the Year in the
United States in 2006, and many others.</P>
      <P>Chen based his idea for the new product line on his strong belief that "life
should always involve art" and the project aims to create "porcelain for daily
life."</P>
      <P>Chen has received many accolades for his role in promoting cultural creativity
in Taiwan. He has expanded his business to 53 countries with about 6,000 stores,
but he has an even bigger dream.</P>
      <P>"I want to introduce my porcelain into the everyday lives of ordinary people,
pieces that are affordable and practical to own, " Chen told the Central News
Agency.</P>
      <P>"People should welcome art into their lives and become more involved in the
arts," Chen said.</P>
      <P>The first new works were a set of white porcelain products that debuted on April
8.  They were produced in cooperation  with Bernardaud, a French company founded
in 1863 in the city of Limoges. Bernardaud is the main source of tableware for
top Michelin-rated restaurants.</P>
      <P>This white porcelain tableware has a clean, modern esthetic that is quite
different from products previously designed by Franz.</P>
      <P>Franz's products are made in the town of Jingde in Jingxi province, China --
known as the "Porcelain Capital" since it has been producing quality porcelain
for 1,700 years.</P>
      <P>From its founding as an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) to developing its
own brand, it has been a long journey to prominence, Chen said.</P>
      <P>According to the management of Franz, developing its own brand allowed the firm
to successfully expand and become more easily accepted and trusted by their
customers. Prior to the debut of Franz's new line, many five-star hotels such as
the Peninsula Shanghai and the Grand Hyatt Beijing had already placed orders.</P>
      <P>Chen said that creativity emanates from the values embodied in traditional
culture and that he continually strives to embrace those cultural norms while
exploring new directions and extending customary ideas.</P>
      <P>In addition to his goal of emulating the role of Bernardaud -- but in the
Chinese-speaking world -- by providing top restaurants and hotels in the area
with high-quality tableware, Chen wants his Taiwan-made brand to be well-
received by people in the region.</P>
      <P>Chen is currently conducting a survey on the preferences of Taiwanese people. He
not only wishes that his products will enjoy commercial success, but also
expects to continue to develop new items to enrich people's daily lives. CNA

      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) has mapped out a project to promote the
hotel and catering service industry, hoping to generate investment of NT$1.5
billion (US$31.74 million) and create 2,000 jobs, a ministry official said
Sunday.</P>
      <P>Although starting a catering business requires a low amount of capital
investment, the catering industry offers a number of jobs to middle-aged and
older people and is a major source of services sector employment, according to
the official.</P>
      <P>The ministry is therefore giving high priority to further developing the
industry, he said.</P>
      <P>In 2009, the number of hotel and catering facilities totaled 98,932, generating
production value of NT$321.8 billion and offering 693,000 jobs, according to
MOEA statistics.</P>
      <P>Despite a drop in domestic demand amid the global financial crisis beginning in
the fourth quarter of 2008, the sector still posted a 2.4 growth rate between
2007-2009, the official said.</P>
      <P>In view of the importance of the sector's contribution to Taiwan's services
industry employment, the ministry has devised the 2010-2013 investment project.</P>
      <P>The government's goal is to both bring gourmet foods from around the world to
Taiwan and to introduce Taiwanese delicacies abroad, the official said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's cafe chain 85 Degrees Celsius has 422 outlets around the globe, while
Din Tai Fung, a restaurant famous for its steamed pork dumplings, also has
numerous overseas branches, he added.</P>
      <P>The ministry plans to hold 50 business-matching meetings for Taiwanese and
foreign enterprises this year with the aim of helping them open 400 stores in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The ministry will also help catering operators organize</P>
      <P>friendship associations, assist in training for hospitality and catering
professionals, and set up a gourmet food "special zone" to promote delicacies
from around the world.</P>

      <P>Radka Vodickova, a triathlon athlete from the Czech Republic, won the women's
race at the Miaoli Triathlon Sunday with a time of 1:52:48.</P>
      <P>A Taiwanese man, Wang Hao-hsiang from Kinmen, took the men's title with 1:46:01.</P>
      <P>Upon winning the women's title, Vodickova, who has won 10 gold medals in
international triathlons since 2004, said it was her first competition in Taiwan
and that she will depart with a very good impression, including the island's
beautiful scenery and kind, gentle people.</P>
      <P>She said the 20km cycling and 5km standard run were challenging due to uphills
in many road sections.</P>
      <P>"The beautiful scenery by the roadsides, however, compensated for my fatigue," a
light-hearted Vodickova said.</P>
      <P>Wang thanked his coach for extending "crucial and endless support" to him after
he suffered neck and back injuries in 2008.</P>
      <P>He said he will continue to compete in triathlons while seeking to enter a
graduate school for advanced studies in sports.</P>
      <P>The 2010 Miaoli Triathlon kicked off at the West Lake Resortopia in the northern
county of Miaoli Saturday, with nearly 2,000 local and foreign athletes
participating.</P>
      <P>King Pu-tsung, secretary-general of the ruling Kuomintang, and former Department

    <TEXT>
      <P>Two days before the Legislative Yuan is to hold a vote on the presidential
nominee for the country's prosecutor general, lawmakers are divided along party
lines.</P>
      <P>A team of legislators from the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) , which controls a
majority of the legislative seats, is set to recommend that their party's
lawmakers  throw their weight behind Huang Shih-ming.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lu Hsueh-chang, convener of the 11-member KMT team, said on Sunday
that Huang was deemed the best candidate for the post by an association of
prosecutors because he is rarely involved in any controversy and his integrity
is impeccable.</P>
      <P>"We will submit our recommendation to a Monday meeting of party lawmakers who
are supposed to heed our suggestion," Lu said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  the legislative caucus of opposition Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) said it would ask DPP lawmakers to vote against the nominee.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Tsai Huang-liang said that Huang is biased against the DPP,
citing his 1995 indictment of former Penghu Magistrate Kao Chih-peng, a member
of DPP.</P>
      <P>Kao was given a suspended 15-month jail term for forgery in that case.</P>
      <P>However, DPP Legislator Ker Chien-ming -- who doubles as the director of the DPP
Policy Committee -- said the DPP caucus will not discipline party lawmakers who
vote across the party line.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou nominated Huang to fill the post left vacant by Chen
Tsung-ming after Chen, who was impeached by the Control Yuan, resigned on Jan.
19.</P>
      <P>With the KMT controlling 75 seats at the 113-seat legislature, the nomination is
almost sure to be approved on Tuesday.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan is very likely to see a crisis of trust among generations because of its
quickly aging population, opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
Chairperson Tsai Ing-wen predicted Sunday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a seminar on the impact of the aging population on social
development, Tsai said that elderly people will account for 16 percent of
Taiwan's total population in 10 years and that the ratio will probably rise even
higher.</P>
      <P>"Against this backdrop, what our society will face in the future may not be
distrust between our two major political camps, but distrust among different
generations," Tsai said.</P>
      <P>Acting on her directive, the DPP plans to draw up a package of "10-year policy
guidelines" later this year as the first step to help address challenges Taiwan
will face in the coming decade, Tsai said.</P>
      <P>"I hope the DPP will be a visionary and forward-looking party that is able to
foresee future problems our country may face and map out tactics to resolve
them," Tsai said.</P>
      <P>With the local population aging, Tsai said, Taiwan may see its population
decline after peaking in the next decade.</P>
      <P>Moreover, she went on, young people will shoulder an increasing financial burden
while facing substantial changes in industrial trends and job markets.</P>
      <P>In the coming decade, Tsai said that local people may become increasingly
reliant on public health care and that society could undergo wealth
redistribution.</P>
      <P>With the younger generation assuming increasing financial burden, Tsai predicted
that a crisis of trust could erupt among different generations.</P>
      <P>"To avoid the worst-case scenario, we need to have foresight, insight and a
broad perspective in formulating policy initiatives, " Tsai said.</P>
      <P>Expressing her aversion to intransigence, Tsai said the DPP will promote social
dialogue to pool wisdom and resources to deal with future challenges and boost
the well-being of Taiwan's people.</P>
      <P>Sunday's seminar was presided over by Chu Hai-yuan, a research fellow at
Academia Sinica's Institute of Social Sciences, and attended by many noted
sociologists and economists.</P>
      <P>Three other seminars will be held April 22, April 24 and May 2, to deal with
three topics: the next wave of ecological disaster, Taiwan's new economic
development strategy amid globalization, and Taiwan's strategy in the face of a
changing international situation.</P>
      <P>The DPP is scheduled to unveil its "10-year policy guidelines" at its 2010
national congress in August.</P>
      <P>Responding  to criticism that the guidelines  are election platforms, Tsai said
they would by no means be formulated for that purpose.</P>
      <P>"Election platforms outline a short-term agenda, while the planned 10-year
policy guidelines will mainly target long-term problems," she said.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's alternative rock band sensation Mayday left its mark in tinsel town
last night as thousands of diehard fans flooded into the Gibson Amphitheater at
Universal Studio Hollywood to rock out to the group's tunes.</P>
      <P>Mayday was the first Taiwan band to perform at the venue.</P>
      <P>With fame sweeping across the globe, the award-winning group -- comprised of
five best friends -- attracted over 4,500 devotees from Japan, Malaysia,
Singapore, Hong Kong, China and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Waving glow sticks and wearing Mayday 2010 DNA World Tour t-shirts, fans
screamed as the band brought the house down with popular songs such as "Drag
Race, " "You are Not Truly Happy" and "Exploding Liver."</P>
      <P>The decibel level in the theater shot through the roof when the lead singer,
Ashin, belted out one of their most popular hits, "Depart from Earth," bringing
the entire audience to their feet.</P>
      <P>At one point, the hard-edged ambiance mellowed out and turned borderline tear-
jerking when the five band members, sometimes dubbed the "Beatles of the Chinese
community, " held hands and sang to their friendship throughout the years.</P>
      <P>Connie Yang and Illy Zhou, two students from Taiwan and China, said driving five
hours from Las Vegas to hear their favorite group was well worth the time.</P>
      <P>"I love their songs because they energize  me.  But most importantly, their
lyrics really speak to me, as if we share the same perspective on life, " said
Zhou, who saw Mayday perform in Beijing last year.</P>
      <P>For North Carolina native Jesse Gyongyos and his new bride Amanda Hsu from
Taiwan, coming to the Mayday concert just one month after their wedding "was
part of the celebration of our marriage."</P>
      <P>Gyongyos became familiar with Mayday when he studied Chinese in college and Hsu
became a fan after her American husband introduced her to their music.</P>
      <P>It was Mayday's second trip to Los Angeles after their previous gig in 2007, but
guitar player Ming said that if time allowed, the group would come back every
year to meet their overseas fans.</P>
      <P>This is the band's fifth world tour since its formation in 1997. The tour
started in New York and will continue on to San Francisco before heading to
China and Singapore.</P>

      <P>Two environmental groups called on Taiwan's people Sunday to purchase public
land near the estuary of the country's longest river and put the land under
trust to protect endangered Chinese white dolphins.</P>
      <P>Tsai Chia-yang, chairman of the Taiwan Environmental Protection Union Changhua
Division, said that fewer than 100 Chinese white dolphins -- also known as Indo-
Pacific humpback dolphins -- remained along the west coast of Taiwan because of
industrial and land development.</P>
      <P>The dolphins, which are white in color and endemic to Taiwan, were discovered in
2002 off the island's west coast and in 2008 listed by the International Union
for Conservation of Nature as critically endangered. They are usually seen
between 20 to 800 meters from shore as they prefer shallow coastal waters.</P>
      <P>The dolphins are on the verge of extinction in the area, where biodiversity has
been seriously threatened by economic development over the past three to four
decades, Tsai said.</P>
      <P>He said the government has preserved over 4,000 hectares of land near the
estuary of Jhuoshuei River between the western counties of Changhua and Yunlin
to be used for the development of a new naphtha cracking plant.</P>
      <P>The area, however, has traditionally been a haven for Chinese white dolphins,
other marine animals and migratory birds.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Tung Chin-sheng, chairman of the Taipei-based Taiwan Environmental
Information Center, said his office invited Oliver Maurice,  an official  with
the International  National  Trust Organization in charge of planning and
development, to Taiwan to help residents buy public land.</P>
      <P>Tung said that according to the center's plan, a corridor of 200 hectares of
land along the estuary will be purchased in the first phase of the project, with
each unit of 1 square meter zoned as one share and selling at a cost of NT$119.</P>
      <P>A trust fund will be raised through the land sales, Tung said, adding that the
drive is expected to finish in 90 days.</P>
      <P>"All the nation's citizens are welcome to be a landlord, " he said.</P>
      <P>So far, over NT$1.8 million (US$57,100) has been raised through an online fund-
raising drive, he said.</P>
      <P>Maurice said that all the land, coastline and cultural assets, once under trust,
would be prohibited from being resold for generations to come.</P>
      <P>The Chinese white dolphins have an extremely low birth rate and a life span of
30-40 years. It takes 10-12 years for them to reach sexual maturity and a female
dolphin gives birth once every 3-4 years, Tung said.</P>
      <P>The function of the trust is to raise public awareness of the plight of the
dolphins, which are regarded as an indicator of the health of the coastal
waters, he said.</P>
      <P>The humpback dolphins are called "Matsu Fish" by local fishermen because they
are seen most frequently between March and April when when the birthday of
Matsu, the Chinese goddess of the Sea, is celebrated in Taiwan.</P>

      <P>The Taipei City government said on Sunday that some of the artifacts displayed
at the planned Taipei City Museum would be utter garbage.</P>
      <P>Lee Chien-chang, a city councilor of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) , said at a press conference that a wide variety of souvenirs and
artifacts, including ceramic Buddha statues, bronze medals, ancient coins and
commemorative bottles of wine marking the 69th birthday of late President Chiang
Ching-kuo were recovered from the Neihu garbage landfill area.</P>
      <P>Some of the recovered pieces date back to about 40 years ago and play an
important role in the city's culture, Lee said.</P>
      <P>The landfill site is about 53 meters above sea level and was in operation from
1968 to 1985. The volume of garbage at the site is about 2,228,000 cubic meters,
Lee said.</P>
      <P>Saying that excavated artifacts reflected residents' daily lives in the past,
Lee suggested that the city government commission contracted cleaning workers to
better search for hidden treasures.</P>
      <P>DPP Councilor Hsu Shu-hua urged the government to value unearthed artifacts from
a cultural and historical angle.</P>
      <P>Wang Yi-chun, chief secretary of the city's Department of Cultural Affairs, told

of Environmental Protection and garbage disposal contractors to commission
appraisal experts to estimate the worth of recovered artifacts before including

      <P>Taiwan invested up to 1 percent of its gross domestic product (GDP) in green
technology in 2009, compatible with other major countries around the world, the
Cabinet-level Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) said Sunday.</P>
      <P>According to data released by the United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP)
, 15.4 percent of the US$3.163 trillion that countries around the world funneled
into various economic stimulus packages as of June 2009 was channeled into the
green sector, accounting for 0.7 percent of global GDP.</P>
      <P>In terms of UNEP data, the council said in a statement that Taiwan matched the
general world standard in green investment last year as the government spent
NT$133.9 billion (US$4.25 billion) , about 1 percent of the country's GDP, in
the green sector.</P>
      <P>The report said China led the world in terms of green investment in 2009,
pumping in US$216.4 billion or 3 percent of its GDP.</P>
      <P>The United States came in second, with US$94.1 billion or 0.7 percent of GDP,
followed by South Korea with US$36.3 billion or 3 percent of its GDP and Japan
at US$36 billion or 0.8 percent.</P>
      <P>In terms of per capita green investment, South Korea topped all other countries,
with US$1,238 per person, and up to 95.2 percent of its stimulus package was
funneled into the green sector, the CEPD said.</P>
      <P>With global warming becoming a major concern, the CEPD said, the development of
low-carbon industries is the wave of the future. In line with the trend, it
added, the government has launched 10 landmark projects, with the goal of
raising the energy efficiency by 2 percent annually in the next eight years and
the annual carbon emission being lowered to the 2000 level by 2025.</P>

      <P>A plan to revamp the debt-laden National Health Insurance program has been

      <P>It has come under fire from civil groups for sharply rising insurance premiums,
from business and industrial groups for putting undue financial burdens on them,
and from lawmakers who question its disproportionately heavy premiums for single

      <P>What is more important is that the plan is intended more to replenish the

      <P>The program, started in 1995, is one of the country's prides -- providing

      <P>The government's plan is focused on funneling more funds into the program and a

      <P>As insurance premiums are shared by employers, employees and the government at a

      <P>MOEA officials discounted a local media report that cross-strait cooperation in
the development of green energy will be included in the "early harvest" lists as
Chinese Vice President Xi Jinping proposed Saturday in his speech to the 2010
Boao Forum for Asia in Hainan province, China.</P>
      <P>"We don't have the slightest idea about that," the officials said.</P>
      <P>They said that the green energy development plan has been proposed under the
"bridge-building project" initiated by the MOEA and aimed at bolstering
industrial exchange and cooperation between Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>Even if cross-strait cooperation in green energy development is carried out
under the proposed ECFA, it should be included as one of the plans for economic
cooperation and has nothing to do with the "early harvest"  lists,  which are
related to tariff and tax concessions, they said.</P>
      <P>The MOEA has since 2008 sponsored dozens of "bridge-building" meetings in Taiwan
on the use of cleaner production technologies in electronics  and  the  areas
of  digital  content  (including e-book/animation/games) ,  textiles and fibers,
biomedicine and aviation maintenance, and industrial waste management.</P>
      <P>Similar meetings were also held in China to build "bridges" for the bicycle,

      <P>After the Ministry of Foreign Affairs raised its travel alert for Bangkok to red
Sunday, Taiwanese tourists will have to sign responsibility waivers if they want
to travel to the city, according to the Travel Agent Association of R.O.C,
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The ministry raised its alert level to red after at least 20 people died and 800
were hurt in clashes between security forces and opposition protesters in the
Thai capital.</P>
      <P>A red alert -- the highest level in the system -- means that travel agents have
to cancel all packaged tours to Bangkok from Monday and offer refunds to their
customers after deducting visa and passport fees,  said Hsu Kao-ching,
secretary-general  of the association.</P>
      <P>Travelers who were scheduled to depart for Bangkok Monday were being informed
individually, Hsu added.</P>
      <P>The stipulations do not apply to passengers only transiting at Bangkok airport,
Hsu said.</P>
      <P>Refunds will likely include the cost of airline tickets and hotel deposits, a
travel agent said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, both China Airlines and EVA Air said they will offer full refunds to
those who already booked tickets.</P>
      <P>The announcement of a red alert stirred mixed reactions from outgoing travelers.
Some at Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport expressed concern about their
safety and said they received the information too late to change their
itineraries.</P>
      <P>Others, however, said they weren't worried and would go on with their trips as
planned.</P>

      <P>Taiwanese and Chinese delegates to a roundtable meeting in Boao, China
unanimously called Sunday for the two sides of the Taiwan Strait to sign a

      <P>The meeting was part of the Boao Forum for Asia, an annual event that brings
together politicians, economists and business executives to discuss regional
development strategies.</P>
      <P>Frederick Chien, a veteran diplomat who heads the Taiwanese delegation, and
former Tianjin Mayor Dai Xianglong co-chaired the roundtable session.</P>
      <P>"Signing the ECFA is just a matter of course for the two sides, " Dai said at

      <P>On Saturday, Chien met with Chinese Vice President Xi Jinping for wide-ranging
talks. During their meeting, Xi also expressed support for prompt signing of
ECFA, widely seen as a scaled-back free trade agreement (FTA).</P>
      <P>Taiwan is working hard to conclude ECFA talks with China in hopes that the deal
will facilitate its participation in regional economic integration and its bid
to sign FTAs with its major trade partners.</P>
      <P>Without striking an ECFA deal with China, many countries that maintain
diplomatic ties with China seem to be reluctant to hold FTA talks with Taiwan

Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>MOEA officials discounted a local media report that cross-strait cooperation in
the development of green energy will be included in the "early harvest" lists as
Chinese Vice President Xi Jinping proposed Saturday in his speech to the 2010
Boao Forum for Asia in Hainan province, China.</P>
      <P>"We don't have the slightest idea about that," the officials said.</P>
      <P>They said that the green energy development plan has been proposed under the
"bridge-building project" initiated by the MOEA and aimed at bolstering
industrial exchange and cooperation between Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>Even if cross-strait cooperation in green energy development is carried out
under the proposed ECFA, it should be included as one of the plans for economic
cooperation and has nothing to do with the "early harvest"  lists,  which are
related to tariff and tax concessions, they said.</P>
      <P>The MOEA has since 2008 sponsored dozens of "bridge-building" meetings in Taiwan
on the use of cleaner production technologies in electronics  and  the  areas
of  digital  content  (including e-book/animation/games) ,  textiles and fibers,
biomedicine and aviation maintenance, and industrial waste management.</P>
      <P>Similar meetings were also held in China to build "bridges" for the bicycle,
precision machinery, automobile, telecommunications, green energy, food,
wholesale and retail, e-commerce and logistics industries, they said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>After the Ministry of Foreign Affairs raised its travel alert for Bangkok to red
Sunday, Taiwanese tourists will have to sign responsibility waivers if they want
to travel to the city, according to the Travel Agent Association of R.O.C,
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The ministry raised its alert level to red after at least 20 people died and 800
were hurt in clashes between security forces and opposition protesters in the
Thai capital.</P>
      <P>A red alert -- the highest level in the system -- means that travel agents have
to cancel all packaged tours to Bangkok from Monday and offer refunds to their
customers after deducting visa and passport fees,  said Hsu Kao-ching,
secretary-general  of the association.</P>
      <P>Travelers who were scheduled to depart for Bangkok Monday were being informed
individually, Hsu added.</P>
      <P>The stipulations do not apply to passengers only transiting at Bangkok airport,
Hsu said.</P>
      <P>Refunds will likely include the cost of airline tickets and hotel deposits, a
travel agent said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, both China Airlines and EVA Air said they will offer full refunds to
those who already booked tickets.</P>
      <P>The announcement of a red alert stirred mixed reactions from outgoing travelers.
Some at Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport expressed concern about their
safety and said they received the information too late to change their
itineraries.</P>
      <P>Others, however, said they weren't worried and would go on with their trips as
planned.</P>

      <P>Taiwanese and Chinese delegates to a roundtable meeting in Boao, China
unanimously called Sunday for the two sides of the Taiwan Strait to sign a
proposed  economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) as early as possible.</P>
      <P>The meeting was part of the Boao Forum for Asia, an annual event that brings
together politicians, economists and business executives to discuss regional
development strategies.</P>
      <P>Frederick Chien, a veteran diplomat who heads the Taiwanese delegation, and
former Tianjin Mayor Dai Xianglong co-chaired the roundtable session.</P>
      <P>"Signing the ECFA is just a matter of course for the two sides, " Dai said at
the opening of the session.</P>
      <P>Stressing that both sides will benefit from the deal, Dai said he sees no
reasons for any delay in striking the deal.</P>
      <P>Chien echoed Dai's views, expressing his hope that the agreement can be signed
by June as scheduled.</P>
      <P>On Saturday, Chien met with Chinese Vice President Xi Jinping for wide-ranging
talks. During their meeting, Xi also expressed support for prompt signing of
ECFA, widely seen as a scaled-back free trade agreement (FTA).</P>
      <P>Taiwan is working hard to conclude ECFA talks with China in hopes that the deal
will facilitate its participation in regional economic integration and its bid
to sign FTAs with its major trade partners.</P>
      <P>Without striking an ECFA deal with China, many countries that maintain
diplomatic ties with China seem to be reluctant to hold FTA talks with Taiwan
for fears of offending Beijing.</P>

      <P>No one at the Taiwan embassy or the technical  mission in the Solomon  Islands
was injured  in a 7.1-magnitude earthquake that struck the South Pacific island
state Sunday, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA).</P>
      <P>MOFA spokesman Henry Chen said late Sunday that the ministry made several phone
calls to Taiwan Ambassador George Chan immediately after the earthquake and was
assured that the embassy staff and technical mission members as well as their
families were all safe.</P>
      <P>Ambassador Chan contacted Solomon Islands Prime Minister Derek Sikua and its
police commissioner to obtain information in the aftermath of the quake and to
extend Taiwan's sympathy, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Timothy C.T. Yang has instructed Chan to provide any
possible aid to the Solomon Islands, one of Taiwan's allies in the region, Chen
said.</P>
      <P>According to other MOFA officials, local media outlets have learned that some
people in a remote tribal village in the Solomon Islands' Isabel Province were
injured, but that the damage there was not severe.</P>
      <P>The reports cited their source as the chieftain himself, Stanley Tabeva, who
made a laborious effort to offer aid to the victims of Typhoon Morakot in Taiwan
last year.</P>
      <P>On Monday, the China Times reported that the village had suffered some damage
during the earthquake and that Tabeva's wife had sustained minor leg injuries.</P>
      <P>According to foreign wire reports, the earthquake hit the Solomon Islands at
8.40 p.m. Sunday. The epicenter of the quake was located 97 kilometers southwest
off Kira Kira in the Pacific Ocean.</P>
      <P>No tsunami warning had yet been issued yet, the reports stated.</P>
      <P>The Solomon Islands, which is located in the South pacific Ocean east of Papua
New Guinea, consists of nearly 1,000 islands. It covers a land mass of 27,986
square kilometers. The capital, Honiara, is on the island of Guadalcanal.</P>

      <P>Long-term control by the military helped save a tract of land in metropolitan
Taipei from development and thus preserve its natural ecology, but the situation
may change soon, as part of the area will be bulldozed to make way for a
biotechnology park.</P>
      <P>The 185-hectare area in Nangang district near Academia Sinica originally housed
a military equipment production facility, commonly known as Factory No. 202,
under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of National Defense (MND).</P>
      <P>The factory  complex  comprises  three sections,  with the administrative and
weaponry production facilities in the west wing and the ammunitions workshop
occupying the other two-thirds of the compound, MND sources said.</P>
      <P>Based on security concerns, only one-third of the factory staff are allowed to
enter the ammunitions workshop, the sources said, adding that the restriction
has helped protect the natural ecology in the area.</P>
      <P>The three ponds on the site not only contribute to the beautiful scenery but are
also ideal natural habitats for a wide variety of aquatic plants and waterbirds,
the sources said. Even some endangered species, such as Formosan blue magpies
and hawks, nest in the area.</P>
      <P>However, the landscape may soon change as the the military, under instructions
from the Executive Yuan, has decided to allocate 25.5 hectares of land to
Academia Sinica, the country's top academic institution, for a new biotechnology
research park.</P>
      <P>As a matter of fact, MND sources said, only 35 percent of the Factory No. 202
area is suitable for new construction. The topography of rest of the land is
mostly hills and gorges, which makes it unsuitable for construction purposes,
the sources said.</P>
      <P>Apart from the natural scenery and special ecology on the site, it is also rich
in history and culture. The centuries-old cemetery of a senior Qing Dynasty
official, an ancient artillery and three temples built centuries ago are all
located within the complex.</P>
      <P>The MND's Armaments Bureau is scheduled to hand over the 25.5-hectares of land
to Academia Sinica next year, but some environmental groups are pushing the
Executive Yuan to reconsider its decision. Environmentalists said they hope the
area would be retained as an ecological conservation site.</P>
      <P>Responding to the call, an Academia Sinica spokesman said that less than 10
hectares of land to be allocated by the MND will be used to build the planned
biotech research park, while the remainder will be developed as a recreational
area.</P>
      <P>The institution will aim for low-impact development of the land in order not to
spoil the natural environment, the spokesman added.</P>

04/12/10  12:26:32
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>and the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) are engaged in a race to
advocate tax cuts for the industrial sector, putting on a pre-election tax
holiday show.</P>
      <P>The KMT has proposed a new version of an industrial innovation bill that would
slash the corporate income tax rate from the current 20 percent to 17 percent
and retain four functionary tax breaks, while the DPP has put forth a version
that would lower the corporate income tax rate to 17.5 percent but remove the
four tax incentives.</P>
      <P>This tax cut race by the two parties will eat into government revenues, which
already suffered from a record shortfall of more than NT$240 billion in 2009.</P>
      <P>What is even more regrettable is that the Ministry of Finance has been sitting
idly by in the face of these tax cut race.</P>
      <P>Minister of Finance Lee Sush-der has been a target of public criticism. How can
a finance minister be so reluctant to defend government policy or to take
responsibility to win the electorate's support and trust?</P>
      <P>The KMT's version of the bill is likely to clear the legislative floor soon, as
it is not expected to encounter much opposition from the DPP. But the bill will
only serve to further deplete the national coffers as it will also cater to big
industrial players even more than the Statute for Industrial Upgrading which
expired at the end of 2009.</P>
      <P>The new plan is unfair and ill-advised because it does not include small and
medium-sized enterprises or ordinary taxpayers and it leaves very little room
for discretionary spending.</P>
      <P>However, not all key business players favor the tax cuts. Taiwan Semiconductor
Manufacturing Co. Chairman Morris Chang has said that given the current
situation, the tax cut proposal is wrong and the government definitely should
not cut the tax.</P>
      <P>"The business sector should be allowed to stand on its own feet," Chang said.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou would risk ruining his record in Taiwan's history by
condoning an irresponsible tax cut proposal that would leave the country's
finances in an unprecedented crisis. (April 12, 2010).</P>

      <P>Five members of the Taiwan Mountain Rescuers Association have the first
successful expedition to conquer the Coastal Mountain Range in eastern Taiwan,
which they dubbed as "Taiwan's Amazon jungle."</P>
      <P>"The 37-day expedition was a challenge because the pristine forest is thick with
sturdy wild growth and full of venomous snakes, leeches,  mosquitoes and yellow
vines (Calamus Burret) , " Ke Cheng-ming, leader of the team, said at the end of
the tough 170-kilometer trek Sunday.</P>
      <P>Although the range elevates only 600 to 700 meters above sea level and its
highest peak is just 1,682 meters, its rugged terrain makes it hard to scale, Ke
said.</P>
      <P>"Many of its ridge lines are formed  by fault breccia... sometimes, we had to
brave strong winds to climb the steep cliffs.... I have scaled the Central
Mountain Range, Jade Mountain and Syueshan Mountain, but the Coastal Range was
the most difficult to conquer, " Ke said.</P>
      <P>Because of the Coastal Range's rough topology, no one had ever before completed
a vertical exploration of the east coast mountains that stretch 150 kilometers
from Hualien County in the north to Taitung County in the south, with the
Hsiukuluan River cutting through it.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>As the ruling and opposition lawmakers squared off over an industrial innovation
bill, President Ma Ying-jeou weighed in late Sunday with a five-point argument
in support of a business income tax cut.</P>
      <P>This rare intervention by the president in a legislative matter made the
headlines of leading newspapers Monday. The following are excerpts of their
reports: China Times:</P>
      <P>President Ma's five-point argument in favor of the tax cuts showed that there is
consensus among Presidential Office, the Executive Yuan and the ruling party
lawmakers that the business income tax should be cut from 20 percent to 17
percent.</P>
      <P>But, the tax breaks offered for personnel training and the establishment of
business headquarters and international logistics hubs would be removed. Tax
incentives would only be allowed for research and development, in line with the
goals of the bill.</P>
      <P>But a KMT lawmaker expressed doubts that the R&amp;D category would be approved
by the legislature in light of the fact that business income tax will be slashed
by 3 percent.</P>
      <P>According to one analyst, the loss of government revenue as a result of the
business income tax cut will be offset by the increase in revenues from personal
income tax derived from higher employment. United Daily News:</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan flip-flopped on the industrial innovation bill when it agreed
to slash the business income tax to 17 percent. However, it intends to retain
the four categories of tax incentives mentioned in the bill.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan gave in to KMT lawmakers who insisted that the ruling part
should 'outbid' the opposition Democratic Progressive Party, which has suggested
a proposed abusiness income tax of 17.5 percent. (April 12, 2010) Economic Daily
News:</P>
      <P>According to Ministry of Finance (MOF) estimates, government revenue from
business income tax will decrease by NT$50 billion a year if the tax rate is cut
to 17 percent and the four categories of tax incentives are retained.</P>
      <P>If the rate is cut to 17.5 percent and tax incentives are offered in two
categories, the revenue will drop by NT$30 billion, the MOF projected.</P>
      <P>According to an MOF official, either proposal would be acceptable to the
ministry, as lower taxes would encourage multinational corporations to relocate
their headquarters to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>However, the MOF hopes to exclude the four categories of tax breaks which would
entail a lot of paperwork, the official said.</P>
      <P>Preston W. Chen, chairman of the Chinese National Federation of Industries, said
he don't care whether the tax rate is set at 17 percent or 17.5 percent, as long
as the bill is enacted as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>"I am very disappointed that the bill has been bogged down in the legislature
because of partisan bickering," he said. (April 12, 2010) Commercial Times:</P>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan will vote on the industrial innovation bill Friday, and
negotiations on the bill will begin Tuesday between the different party

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan completes plans for environmental hormone management</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan has completed plans to control endocrine disrupter substances (EDS),
commonly known as environmental hormones,  in different  stages,  the
Environmental  Protection Administration (EPA) said Monday.</P>
      <P>The plans were drawn up by an inter-ministerial task force put together by the
EPA, with clear definitions of which ministries and government agencies should
be responsible for which fields of EDS management and control, according to an
EPA statement.</P>
      <P>Endocrine disrupters are exogenous substances that act like hormones in the
endocrine system and disrupt the physiological function of endogenous hormones.
The U.S. government defines an environmental endocrine or hormone disrupter as
"an exogenous agent that interferes with the synthesis, secretion, transport,
binding, action, or elimination of natural hormones in the body that are
responsible  for the maintenance of homeostasis,  reproduction, development,
and/or behavior."</P>
      <P>Taiwan was alerted amid rising concerns in the international community over harm
caused by environmental hormones. While endocrine disrupters exist in a wide
range of different fields, controlling their spread needs cooperation  among a
variety  of different ministries and government agencies, the EPA said.</P>
      <P>To that end, the plans call for six government authorities to be assigned to the
management of EDS in their respective fields, according to the statement.</P>
      <P>The Department of Health will be responsible for EDS in food, food containers
and medical equipment and devices, while the Council of Agriculture will be
assigned to EDS in pesticides, feed and agricultural products, the Ministry of
Economic Affairs will deal with commodities and toys, the EPA will be
responsible for household pesticides, drinking water and indoor air quality, the
Ministry of the Interior will deal with green architecture and green
construction materials and the Ministry of Finance will handle liquor safety,
the statement said.</P>
      <P>This year, efforts will also be made to review and modify regulations
stipulating the management of environmental hormones in commodities, food
products and the environment, such as principles for screening and defining
toxic substances, the EPA said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The recent sighting of a new cluster of the endangered Taiwan cow-tail fir in
Taitung County gives a shot in the arm to the efforts to protect the rare plant
species, officials in charge of forestation said Monday.</P>
      <P>About 40 full-grown Taiwan cow-tail firs were found late last year on a mountain
ridge 750 meters above sea level in Daren township in the southeastern county of
Taitung, said Huang Chun-tse, a division chief with the Forest Bureau under the
Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture (COA).</P>
      <P>However, the new sighting of the 40 healthy trees has not allayed worry over the
risk of extinction of the species, Huang said.</P>
      <P>The cow-tail fir is an evergreen giant plant of the Pinaceae family and
Keteleeria genus that has existed on Taiwan soil since the Ice Age. A healthy
tree usually yields about 100 seedlings, 20 to 30 of which manage to survive,
Huang said.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, only two young trees were found in the new cluster, he added.</P>
      <P>"Even in the Dawu and Pinglin buffer zones, where some 400 trees are growing,
only one or two new plants are seen occasionally," Huang said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan cow-tail firs, also known as Formosana Hayata, have been under threat
from illegal loggers because of its fine oily wood. It is called one of the four
wonder trees in Taiwan, along with Cycas taiwaniana, Amentotaxus formosana Li,
and Taiwan date palm.</P>
      <P>It is categorized as "critically endangered" by the COA and is listed as one of
the 11 rare and precious plants in the country by the Cabinet-level Council for
Cultural Affairs. Currently, there are fewer than 500 trees on the island, most
of which are found in Pinglin, Taipei County and Dawu, Taitung County, Huang
said.</P>
      <P>Tung Shih-liang, director of the Taitung Forest District Office's Guanshan
Station, said the Taiwan cow-tail fir is on the verge of extinction because of
factors such as logging, typhoons, fires, and climate change. The species'
narrow gene pool is another major reason why it is declining, he added.</P>
      <P>"Expanding  its gene pool may help it to develop greater adaptability to
environmental changes," Tung suggested.</P>

      <P>The largest auto parts show and automobile electronics show in Asia this year
opened together Monday in Taipei, touting eco-friendly products as demand for
green energy increases.</P>
      <P>"This year's Automobile Electronics Show for the first time offers an area
showcasing electrical and hybrid auto parts, " said Chao Yuen-chuan, president
and chief executive of the Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA) ,
a government-sponsored trade promotion body.</P>
      <P>The area was set up as electric vehicles have become a mainstream idea in the
future of the automobile industry, he said at an opening ceremony.</P>
      <P>"It showcases the technical  strength of Taiwan's R&amp;D and manufacturing
ability in lithium-iron batteries, motor modules and other key components for
electric vehicles, " he added.</P>
      <P>The global automobile electronics market is expected to be worth US$176 billion
by 2012, said Arthur Chiao, chairman of the Taiwan Electrical and Electronic
Manufacturers' Association (TEEMA).</P>
      <P>The market will continue to grow thanks to robust growth in the automobile
market in Asia and stable demand from markets in Europe and the United States,
he told the show's opening ceremony.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's competitive edge in information and communications technology (ICT) can
help establish the country as a major supplier for the world's automobile
electronics industry, he added.</P>
      <P>The number of exhibitors at the two shows totaled 1,011 this year, occupying
2,711 booths and representing a 6-percent rise from last year.</P>
      <P>"By contrast, exhibitions in other countries have posted declines due to the
global financial crisis, " said Huang Chih-peng, head of the Bureau of Foreign
Trade under the Ministry of Economic Affairs.</P>
      <P>Both shows will run until April 15 at the Taipei World Trade Center's Nangang
Exhibition Hall, open only to trade visitors except for the final two days, when
they will be open to the general public.</P>
      <P>More than 55,000 people from home and 5,500 people from abroad are expected to
visit the shows, according to the organizers.</P>

      <P>"Slow to respond" has become the Foreign Ministry's signature. It did its duty
by issuing an orange travel alert for the Thai capital of Bangkok last Wednesday
when large-scale demonstrations took place there.</P>
      <P>However, the ministry failed to warn travelers against visiting Bangkok after
bloody conflicts erupted between demonstrators and the security forces Saturday,
issuing a warning only the following morning.</P>
      <P>There are more than 3,000 Taiwanese tourists in Thailand, 2,000 of whom are in
Bangkok. If any of them have been injured, what level of responsibility should
the ministry be held accountable for?</P>
      <P>The ministry has inherited the bureaucratic tradition of the Qing dynasty's
Tsungli Yamen, or foreign office, and has become known for its sluggish
reactions and its arrogance.</P>
      <P>Many ministry officials think that with the diplomatic truce with China in place
they do not have to go to great lengths to cement ties with Taiwan's allies. If
that is true, should the ministry be wiped out altogether once Taiwan has

    <DATELINE>04/12/10  16:56:58
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The heads of the ruling and opposition parties are set to have a debate April 25
on whether Taiwan should enter into an economic cooperation framework agreement
with China. We regret that an economic option amid the rapid transformation of
the global economy has degenerated into an argument over betraying Taiwan versus
loving Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The agreement of course will give rise to political concerns, but it is more an
economic issue. The question is, can Taiwan sit on its hands while the rest of
the Asian states are quickly coalescing into a single market?</P>
      <P>Free trade blocs have been sprouting up around the world, with Japan having
forged trade agreements with the Association  of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)
, Mexico, Chile, Australia, South Korea and India, while China has made similar
agreements with ASEAN, Chile, New Zealand, Australia and South Africa.</P>
      <P>There are more such pacts brewing among ASEAN, the United States, the European
Union,  and South  American  states.  Amid this proliferation  of free trade
agreements,  Taiwan  is becoming increasingly isolated and is watching its trade
power declining year by year.</P>
      <P>By export volume, Taiwan ranked 14 in the world in 2000, two places behind South
Korea, but had fallen to 17 in 2009 compared with South Korea's 9. With its
exports less than half of those of South Korea, how can Taiwan resign itself to
the downward spiral?</P>
      <P>Huang Chih-peng, director-general of the Bureau of Foreign Trade, said in a
televised debate that " the question is how to conclude the pact, not whether to
conclude the pact or not."</P>
      <P>Some critics ask why the government would seek such a deal with China, rather
than other states. The fact is Taiwan has tried to negotiate such pacts with the
United States, Japan, the European Union and ASEAN for many years but has got
nowhere, probably because of Chinese disapproval.</P>
      <P>However, China is Taiwan's biggest export market, accounting for 31 percent of
the country's exports compared to 11.3 percent for the United States, 10.9
percent for the European Union and 6.4 percent for Japan, so it is only natural
that we should seek to enter into such a deal with China.</P>
      <P>We fully agree with Huang Chih-peng's view that the question is how, not
whether, to conclude the pact.</P>
      <P>Anyone who is concerned about the island's future should do his part to help
with the negotiation of the deal rather than trying to block it. (April 12,

      <P>Kaohsiung needs to spend more effort developing its tourism industry and doing
so would also benefit the local production industry, the American Chamber of
Commerce in Kaohsiung (AmCham Kaohsiung) said in its first white paper, which is
scheduled to be released Thursday.</P>
      <P>The report, which focuses on Kaohsiung City and County, is based on 1,737
questionnaires AmCham Kaohsiung sent to companies beginning last year to collect
views and offer suggestions on southern Taiwan's business environment.</P>
      <P>Brian Aiello, president of AmCham Kaohsiung, said that as Kaohsiung City and
Kaohsiung County will merge into a special municipality by the end of this year,
there will not only be difficulties and challenges, but also a lot of
opportunities.</P>
      <P>Aiello said that Taiwan is one of the most beautiful islands he has ever been to
and that Kaohsiung should pay better attention to understand what will really
attract foreign tourists and meet their expectations.</P>
      <P>A tourism industry that relies on Chinese tourists would be "fragile," he said,
noting that the visit of Tibet's exiled spiritual leader the Dalai Lama affected
the tourism business in Kaohsiung for several months last year.</P>
      <P>To develop local tourism, Aiello said that signs at popular tourist spots should
be presented in three languages -- Chinese, English and Japanese.</P>
      <P>Aiello said that he hopes the white paper will help southern Taiwan build a
friendly business environment and attract more foreign investment in the hi-
tech, green technology and tourism industries.</P>
      <P>For more than 20 years, the American Chamber of Commerce in Taipei has released
white papers focusing mostly on northern Taiwan, Aiello said, adding that AmCham
Kaohsiung would expand its survey area to other regions in southern Taiwan next
year.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou assured labor representatives Monday that the government
will not open Taiwan to Chinese workers in the cross-Taiwan  Strait economic
framework cooperation agreement (ECFA) that is currently being negotiated.</P>
      <P>Ma also dismissed reports that the controversial trade pact will cost 3 million
workers their jobs.</P>
      <P>During a meeting with representatives from various labor unions, Ma praised
local workers for their contributions to Taiwan's economic development, and he
tried to mitigate their concerns about the proposed ECFA.</P>
      <P>The president argued that Taiwan's economic recovery should be joined  together
with  the process  of Asia-Pacific  regional integration, and it was "based on
this consideration that we have been negotiating the trade pact with China," he
said.</P>
      <P>Ma reassured his audience that no labor issue has been included in talks on the
cross-strait economic pact, and he guaranteed the labor representatives that no
Chinese workers would be allowed to work in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He also  promised  that  his administration  will  develop complementary
measures to fully protect Taiwanese workers when the trade accord is signed.</P>
      <P>Ma noted that a special article on employment protection has already been added
to an industrial innovation bill which is still being considered in the
Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>The bill would provide subsidies of NT$10,000 per month for six months for each
worker hired by small- and medium-sized enterprises and businesses in
conventional industries, such as textiles, metals, and basic machinery, and the
period could be extended to one year under special circumstances.</P>
      <P>The measure indicates that the government aims to help not only high-tech and
big companies but also smaller companies as well, Ma said.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, National Trade Union Confederation President Jen Moo-shan
complained that labor groups have had difficulty meeting with the president
since he took office two years ago, compared to the considerable time he has
spent meeting with owners of big enterprises.</P>
      <P>Jen suggested that Ma allocate more time for talks with workers to hear their
opinions.</P>
      <P>In response, Ma told the Council of Labor Affairs to arrange forums for local
workers and said that he himself will also attend if his schedule permits him to
go.</P>

      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih said Monday that reaching an economic cooperation framework
agreement (ECFA) with China will prevent Taiwan's isolation, and that the focus
should be on its contents rather than on whether or not it should be signed.</P>
      <P>The key point of debate should be how the deal can best serve Taiwan's interests
and how it can be crafted to have the least impact on local industries, Wu said
while addressing the 20th National Quality Award Ceremony at the Ministry of
Economic Affairs.</P>
      <P>If Taiwan does not sign the ECFA with China, it may lose big opportunities and
trigger deeper economic contraction, the premier argued.</P>
      <P>Wu said the government must do its best to sign the best deal and is willing to
be supervised by the people,  the legislature, opposition parties and the
private sector.</P>
      <P>The government is planning to allocate a budget of NT$95 billion (US$3 billion)
over a 10-year period to assist workers in vulnerable industries after Taiwan
signs the ECFA with China, the premier said last Friday.</P>
      <P>Calling Taiwan's people the country's biggest asset in the face of limited
natural resources, Wu said the persistence, diligence and hard work of the
people had helped spur the country's development.</P>
      <P>But facing tough global competition, Taiwan still needs to become more closely
integrated with the Asia-Pacific region or it will become easily marginalized,
Wu argued.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and China are expected to hold the third round of ECFA talks in China
soon, after concluding their second round of talks in Taiwan in early April.</P>
      <P>The talks, which took place in Taoyuan County March 31-April 1, made little
progress toward forging a consensus on the agreement's "early harvest lists"
drawn up by the two sides for priority tariff treatment or access.</P>

      <P>Many purple crow butterflies are lingering in southern Taiwan longer than usual
this year, a group of butterfly conservationists said Monday.</P>
      <P>After wintering in Kaohsiung County's Maolin area, most of the migratory
butterfly species returned north as usual, but some appear to have turned
further south to the Hengchun Peninsula, said Liao Chin-shan, chief of southern
Taiwan operations for the non-profit Taiwan Purple Crow Butterfly Ecological
Preservation Association.</P>
      <P>Purple crow butterflies usually fly from southern to northern Taiwan in late
March and early April.</P>
      <P>Liao said butterfly researchers are not sure why some of the butterflies have
flown southward from Maolin or Taitung.</P>
      <P>But this year and last year's conditions for migration have not been ideal, Liao
said, adding that the butterflies only fly north when a south wind is blowing,
skies are clear and temperatures are over 28 degrees Celsius.</P>
      <P>In order to study the butterflies' behavior, the association invited volunteers
to catch, mark and release the species. The work was tough and time-consuming,
Liao said, but so far little results have been found because very few of the
marked butterflies have been recaptured.</P>
      <P>As the annual migration route crosses roads at rates of more than 300 per
minute, the National Freeway Bureau seals off some sections of freeways to
facilitate the butterflies' travel.</P>
      <P>The migration has also attracted the attention of foreign mass media, including
the BBC, CNN and National Geographic.</P>
      <P>Recorded migration of purple crow butterflies in Taiwan dates back to 1971.</P>

thanks to its exports of olive oil and wine.</P>
      <P>There is still room in the Taiwan market for exploration by Italian exporters,
Yih said, suggesting that Italian enterprises could cooperate with Taiwanese
businesses in tapping the vast China market, amid ongoing talks between Taiwan

NT$42,509 (US$1,303.96) in 2009, but the real, or inflation-adjusted, wage was
only NT$40,690, lower than the NT$41,874 recorded in 2000.</P>
      <P>Even though Taiwan's gross domestic product (GDP) contracted last year because
of the global financial crisis, Hsieh said, the country still posted a 30
percent growth in GDP over the past decade.</P>
      <P>"The decline in real wages indicates that the benefits of our economic growth
have all been taken by capitalists," Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>Worse still, he added, 70 percent of the country's tax revenues come from wage
earners, a phenomenon that has exacerbated inequitable income distribution in
local society.</P>
      <P>While wage earners are growing poorer, the government has failed to come up with
any effective measures to alleviate the situation, instead simply blaming the
global economic downturn for their plight, Hsieh argued.</P>
      <P>He also accused the government of favoring employers over employees, citing its
efforts to pass an industrial innovation bill and sign an economic cooperation
framework agreement (ECFA) with China while turning a deaf ear to labor group
calls for early passage of amendments to the Labor Standards Act and the
legislation of laws governing dispatched workers and labor unions.</P>
      <P>Dispatched workers refer to those who work for manpower agencies and are
"dispatched" full-time to companies on a contract basis.</P>
      <P>Some companies prefer this arrangement because of the flexibility it gives them
in managing their work forces and because they do not have to pay benefits or
severance to the contract workers.</P>
      <P>Because of the disparity in treatment between employers and workers, Hsieh said
the federation needed to take to the streets to call on the government to heed
the appeals of regular workers.</P>
      <P>Dubbing the May 1 demonstration as an anti-poverty march, Hsieh said the
federation will highlight four appeals -- "fighting poverty and forbidding
dispatched work, " "labor union autonomy, " "labor participation in and
democratic supervision of ECFA, " and "allowing all wage earners to receive
monthly pensions."</P>
      <P>Hsieh said the confederation has asked all of its member groups to begin
preparations for the May 1 Labor Day demonstration.</P>

      <P>Taichung Mayor Jason Hu expressed hope Monday that some of the 30-odd stilt
homes built along the banks of the Green River can be preserved as a historical
site.</P>
      <P>The stilt homes -- built along the river's banks six decades ago as shelters for
Nationalist soldiers who moved to Taiwan in the wake of a Chinese civil war in
1949 -- are scheduled to be torn down soon as part of a railway development
project.</P>
      <P>The central Taiwan city's mayor said that if some of the buildings can be
preserved, as called for by some residents, they can serve as cultural and
historical relics of the post-war era.</P>
      <P>Huang Kuo-jung, chief of the Cultural Affairs Bureau, Taichung City, said the
bureau was planning to make a documentary about the stilt homes.</P>
      <P>However, he added that "the bureau will not seek to have the homes preserved
because all the buildings were built illegally and will eventually be
dismantled."</P>
      <P>Taichung City Deputy Mayor Hsiao Chia-chi, meanwhile, said there was still hope
that some stilt homes on one side of the river can be retained because the
railway project will only affect the other side.</P>

competition for students aged 9-16, is scheduled to be held in Kaohsiung May
6-8, an organizer of the event said Monday.</P>
      <P>It will be the first time the FLL OIC has been held in Taiwan since the
competition started in the United States in 1989, and 64 teams from 23 countries
will be competing, the organizer said.</P>
      <P>Eight teams from Taiwan -- including three elementary school teams from the host
city Kaohsiung -- will take part.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Ju said the theme of this year's challenge is "Smart Move."
The students are required to design and produce robots three months ahead of the
contest, as well as work out solutions to various problems they are given.</P>
      <P>"It is just as difficult as writing a doctoral thesis, " Chen said at a press
conference to announce the competition.</P>
      <P>Su Hsu-sheng,  a fifth-grader from the Kaohsiung Municipal Ling-Jhou Primary

contest will be a great challenge for him.</P>
      <P>According to its official website, the competition consists of two parts --
presentation and robot performance, in which sensor- equipped robots built by
the students out of Lego are required to gain access to places and things, while
avoiding or surviving impact.</P>
      <P>The performance match will last for two-and-a-half minutes, and the tournament

    <HEADLINE>Corporate income tax breaks to cost NT$34.3 billion in revenues</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 12 (CNA)
04/12/10  20:33:16

    <TEXT>
      <P>Finance Minister Lee Sush-der said Monday that additional cuts in Taiwan's
corporate income tax should enhance the country's international competitiveness
but will cost national coffers NT$34.3 billion (US$1.09 billion) in tax
revenues.</P>
      <P>Lee based the estimate on a consensus  reached by ruling Kuomintang (KMT)
lawmakers on the terms of a controversial industrial innovation  bill that the
government  considers  essential  to encouraging innovation and investment in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The caucus decided to keep targeted tax incentives for innovation and R&amp;D
included in a previous version of the bill but dump those for training and
setting up operations headquarters  and logistics centers.</P>
      <P>It also decided to add a provision to cut the corporate income tax from the
current 20 percent to 17 percent, creating a package that would cost the
government NT$34.3 billion, Lee estimated.</P>
      <P>In comparison, a plan suggested by the opposition Democratic Progressive Party
to simply cut corporate income taxes to 17.5 percent and eliminate all targeted
tax incentives would cost the government approximately NT$17.5 billion in tax
revenues,  Lee estimated.</P>
      <P>The finance minister also said a key benefit of the new tax cut package in the
bill would be that they would streamline the operations of companies and the
government, leaving only innovation and R&amp;D among more than 30 categories of
tax breaks on investment under previous regulations.</P>
      <P>If the bill is approved, the new corporate income tax will be similar to that of
Singapore, which Lee said will increase the nation's international
competitiveness.</P>
      <P>Taiwan had only just recently reduced its corporate income tax from 25 percent
to 20 percent, a reduction that took effect on income beginning in 2010.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Ministry of Finance announced that tax revenues in March totaled
NT$151.4 billion, up NT$52.6 billion, or 53.2 percent year-on-year, mainly
because corporate income tax receipts were up NT$29.8 billion from March 2009.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Caregivers to form backbone of foreign work force in Taiwan</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Caregivers will eventually become the mainstay of Taiwan's foreign work force if
the government fails to quickly launch a well-devised long-term care system to
deal with the country's aging population, a labor affairs official said Monday.</P>
      <P>According to the latest figures from the Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) ,
foreign caregivers outnumbered foreign manual laborers in February for the first
time ever in Taiwan, 177,926 to 177,210.</P>
      <P>Although the trend reversed itself in March, with the 180,000 migrant workers in
manual labor jobs slightly outnumbering the 179,000 migrant caregivers, the CLA
official expected that caregivers will form the backbone of the foreign work
force in the long run.</P>
      <P>"The demand for caregiving services will continue rising along with the aging of
our population, if no long-term care system is put in place soon, " said the
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.</P>
      <P>Taiwan began to import migrant workers in 1989 to make up for labor shortages in
manufacturing and construction sectors where harsh working conditions existed.</P>
      <P>Early on, the number of foreign workers in the manufacturing sector consistently
far exceeded that of foreign caregivers, with laborers outnumbering caregivers
by a 10: 1 ratio as recently as 1995.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's rapid economic growth in the second half of the 1990s only increased
the demand for foreign manual laborers, pushing their numbers above 200,000. The
gap between the two categories of migrant workers reached a peak of 170,000 in
1997.</P>
      <P>But even then, the number of foreign caregivers entering Taiwan was also growing
rapidly, and the gap between the two groups has narrowed as the number of
foreign manual laborers remained flat over the past decade and even declined
recently amid a global economic slump.</P>
      <P>In 2009, the number of migrant workers in the manufacturing and construction
sectors decreased to 176,000 while the number of foreign caregivers increased to
more than 174,000.</P>
      <P>Over the past 15 years, the CLA official said, the number of foreign caregivers
has grown 13-fold, from 13,000 in 1994 to 174,000 at the end of last year.</P>
      <P>During the same period, the number of foreign manual laborers has only risen 25
percent.</P>
      <P>The lackluster growth in the manufacturing sector was partly related to the
exodus of labor-intensive industries to China and other countries with cheaper
labor and the government's inability to stimulate industrial innovation and
nurture new industries, local scholars said.</P>
      <P>But the rapid growth in the number of migrant caregivers has also signified the
aging of the local population and the absence of a long-term care system, they
added.</P>

      <P>Labor union officials suggested Monday that unions must be consulted as the
government negotiates the contents of a proposed economic cooperation framework
agreement (ECFA) with China.</P>
      <P>Though President Ma Ying-jeou assured labor representatives in a meeting Monday
morning that the agreement would not oblige Taiwan to open its doors to Chinese
workers, union officials said labor issues should be discussed in the
negotiations, and the opinions of labor unions must be included.</P>
      <P>Hsieh Chuang-chih, secretary-general of the Taiwan Confederation of Trade
Unions, said after the meeting that labor rights and job opportunities are
closely related to the prospects of business and industry.</P>
      <P>He indicated that the unions are very concerned about the impact of the trade
deal on certain industries, despite the president's guarantee.</P>
      <P>Sun Yu-lien, secretary-general of the Taiwan Labor Front, also called on the

    <TEXT>
      <P>The cost of the best seats at Taipei Arena concerts appears to be increasing as
the economy recovers, with tickets for Taiwanese musician Jay Chou's June show
set to run as much as NT$5,500 (US$174), a concert organizer said Monday.</P>
      <P>Choice seats in the house at last week's concert for Harlem Yu, a Taiwanese
singer-songwriter said to have performed the first Mandarin rap song, were
priced at NT$4,200.</P>
      <P>And organizers for the well-known Taiwanese female singer A-mei, or Chang Hui-
mei, also charged NT$4,200 for top seats in the Taipei Arena last month.</P>
      <P>Chou, who has won many musical awards and is famous for composing songs, said
the ticket price reflects the high cost of producing his first indoor concert at
the venue.</P>
      <P>The pop star said at a press conference Monday that he will focus closely on
stage design and that the total cost of the concert will be near NT$100 million.</P>
      <P>One highlight will be a 360-degree three-dimensional projection that alone cost
nearly NT$40 million, the organizer of the concert said.</P>
      <P>However, Chou's concert is still not the most expensive this year.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese heavy-weight musician Liu Chia-chang, 68, held a farewell concert
early this month, and the highest ticket price for what was billed his final
concert in Taiwan reached NT$8,000 -- the priciest gig so far this year.</P>
      <P>The highest concert ticket price among female singers was NT$5,800 for prime
seating at CoCo Lee's performance in late March.</P>
      <P>Lee has not held a concert in Taipei since 1998 and the event was reported to
have cost over NT$100 million -- the highest ever for the venue, organizers
said.</P>
      <P>Other concerts by local singers have not been cheap either, with fans forking
out NT$3,000 to see Rainie Yang and NT$3,600 for the Super Band at the Taipei
Arena earlier this year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Conventional industries seen as biggest beneficiaries of tax cuts</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 12 (CNA)
04/12/10  22:19:44
(By Y.L. Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An agreement reached Monday by the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) legislative caucus to
cut the corporate income tax in Taiwan to 17 percent is expected to give across-
the-board benefits to domestic businesses, industry representatives and analysts
said.</P>
      <P>The caucus reached the consensus during a meeting to discuss a KMT-proposed
version of an industrial innovation bill that would slash the corporate income
tax rate from the current 20 percent to 17 percent and retain tax breaks
targeted at R&amp;D and subsidies for small- and medium-sized businesses for
hiring workers.</P>
      <P>The bill must still be approved by the Legislative Yuan, in which the KMT has a
big majority, before it can become law.</P>
      <P>Analysts believe the bill, if passed, will help improve Taiwan's investment
environment and boost foreign investors' interest in injecting money into the
country.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's largest real estate conglomerate said the move could also benefit the
construction and real estate sector.</P>
      <P>Far Glory Group estimated the tax cut could help it save NT$240 million annually
in taxes, a contribution of NT$0.34 per share.</P>
      <P>After the cut, Taiwan's corporate income tax rate will be the same as
Singapore's and slightly higher than that of China's two special administrative
regions -- Hong Kong and Macau.</P>
      <P>It will make Taiwan more attractive for foreign investors and overseas Taiwanese
businesses, according to Far Glory.</P>
      <P>The petrochemical  sector along with automobile  and steel manufacturers also
welcomed the plan, but they voiced concerns that the proposed tax cut would hurt
national coffers.</P>
      <P>Grand Pacific Petrochemical (GPPC) Group said that lowering the corporate income
tax rate is good news for all, but it should be ensured that the plan will be
carried out fairly and not only cater to the electronics sector and big
enterprises.</P>
      <P>Analysts suggested that conventional industries will be the biggest beneficiary
of the proposal, because they rarely benefited from previous tax breaks directed
primarily at high-tech companies and were also less likely to benefit from the
targeted tax breaks in the original version of the industrial innovation bill.</P>
      <P>The package is expected to help boost after tax earnings per share (EPS) by 3-5
percent for some companies in conventional industries that usually pay corporate
income tax rates of 20 percent and higher, such as President Chain Store Corp.
and China Steel Corp., a foreign analyst said.</P>
      <P>Makalot Industrial Co., one of Taiwan's leading garment makers, estimated the
bill will help the company save NT$36 million, or NT$0.23 per share, if
calculated based on its pretax profits of NT$1.2 billion last year.</P>
      <P>The company's EPS last year was NT$5.8.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, many manufacturers of rubber products, such as tire maker Cheng Shin
Rubber Ind., reported that as they usually pay taxes at rates below 10 percent,
the planned tax cut would have a limited impact on them.</P>
      <P>Upstream rubber material manufacturers, however, including Taiwan Synthetic
Rubber Corp., that normally pay taxes at rates of between 17 percent and 26
percent will benefit more, analysts said.</P>
      <P>Companies in the paper and pulp and foodstuff sectors said the biggest companies
in the sectors would be biggest beneficiaries because they earn more and pay
more in taxes and can therefore save more.</P>
      <P>In contrast, small glass and other building materials producers, such as the
Champion Group and the China Blaze Group, will benefit more than big companies
like Taiwan Glass.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Glass does not have to pay taxes on most of its income, which is derived

      <P>The Suao port free trade zone in northeastern Taiwan is expected to begin
operations in late May after the nation's top economic planning agency approved
its establishment Monday.</P>
      <P>The Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) said the Suao trade
zone is expected to evolve into a green energy industry cluster, creating
NT$6.77 billion in trade in the next five years.</P>
      <P>The CEPD said the Suao free trade zone will become the nation's sixth free trade
port zone, after Taipei, Keelung, Kaohsiung, Taichung and Taoyuan.</P>
      <P>According to the Ministry of Transportation and Communications, the Suao free
trade zone will have a cargo volume of 40,300 tons and create 932 jobs in five
years.</P>
      <P>Wang Chun-yu, director-general of Keelung Harbor, said electric car maker
Pihsiang Machinery Manufacturing Co. entered the Suao port free trade zone last
month and expects to invest NT$1 billion in a facility with an annual production
capacity of 30,000 cars.</P>
      <P>It is expected to begin commercial production in the first quarter of 2011.</P>
      <P>After related industries enter the zone, they will form a green industry supply

parks to develop sources of product processing, the official believed.</P>
      <P>Wang said the Suao port free trade zone will be distinct from the nearby Taipei
and Keeling free trade port zones, as Taipei's focuses on deep-sea container and
international logistics, while Keelung's has put a priority on near-sea
container traffic and tourism and leisure.</P>
      <P>Wang said manufacturers entering the free trade zone will receive a number of
benefits. Up to 40 percent of their staffs can be foreign nationals; they will
be given import duty concessions; and they will be able to process landing visas

    <HEADLINE>Conventional industries seen as biggest beneficiaries of tax cuts</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 12 (CNA)
04/12/10  22:19:44
(By Y.L. Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An agreement reached Monday by the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) legislative caucus to
cut the corporate income tax in Taiwan to 17 percent is expected to give across-
the-board benefits to domestic businesses, industry representatives and analysts
said.</P>
      <P>The caucus reached the consensus during a meeting to discuss a KMT-proposed
version of an industrial innovation bill that would slash the corporate income
tax rate from the current 20 percent to 17 percent and retain tax breaks
targeted at R&amp;D and subsidies for small- and medium-sized businesses for
hiring workers.</P>
      <P>The bill must still be approved by the Legislative Yuan, in which the KMT has a
big majority, before it can become law.</P>
      <P>Analysts believe the bill, if passed, will help improve Taiwan's investment
environment and boost foreign investors' interest in injecting money into the
country.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's largest real estate conglomerate said the move could also benefit the
construction and real estate sector.</P>
      <P>Far Glory Group estimated the tax cut could help it save NT$240 million annually
in taxes, a contribution of NT$0.34 per share.</P>
      <P>After the cut, Taiwan's corporate income tax rate will be the same as
Singapore's and slightly higher than that of China's two special administrative
regions -- Hong Kong and Macau.</P>
      <P>It will make Taiwan more attractive for foreign investors and overseas Taiwanese
businesses, according to Far Glory.</P>
      <P>The petrochemical  sector along with automobile  and steel manufacturers also
welcomed the plan, but they voiced concerns that the proposed tax cut would hurt
national coffers.</P>
      <P>Grand Pacific Petrochemical (GPPC) Group said that lowering the corporate income
tax rate is good news for all, but it should be ensured that the plan will be
carried out fairly and not only cater to the electronics sector and big
enterprises.</P>
      <P>Analysts suggested that conventional industries will be the biggest beneficiary
of the proposal, because they rarely benefited from previous tax breaks directed
primarily at high-tech companies and were also less likely to benefit from the
targeted tax breaks in the original version of the industrial innovation bill.</P>
      <P>The package is expected to help boost after tax earnings per share (EPS) by 3-5
percent for some companies in conventional industries that usually pay corporate
income tax rates of 20 percent and higher, such as President Chain Store Corp.
and China Steel Corp., a foreign analyst said.</P>
      <P>Makalot Industrial Co., one of Taiwan's leading garment makers, estimated the
bill will help the company save NT$36 million, or NT$0.23 per share, if
calculated based on its pretax profits of NT$1.2 billion last year.</P>
      <P>The company's EPS last year was NT$5.8.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, many manufacturers of rubber products, such as tire maker Cheng Shin
Rubber Ind., reported that as they usually pay taxes at rates below 10 percent,
the planned tax cut would have a limited impact on them.</P>
      <P>Upstream rubber material manufacturers, however, including Taiwan Synthetic
Rubber Corp., that normally pay taxes at rates of between 17 percent and 26
percent will benefit more, analysts said.</P>
      <P>Companies in the paper and pulp and foodstuff sectors said the biggest companies
in the sectors would be biggest beneficiaries because they earn more and pay
more in taxes and can therefore save more.</P>
      <P>In contrast, small glass and other building materials producers, such as the
Champion Group and the China Blaze Group, will benefit more than big companies
like Taiwan Glass.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Glass does not have to pay taxes on most of its income, which is derived
from investments overseas, because it has set up a global operating center in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The corporate income tax reduction will only affect its domestic earnings, which
account for less than 20 percent of its total income, and it will have a limited
impact on the company's overall earnings picture.</P>
      <P>Representatives from the cable and wire companies also said the bill will

      <P>The measure drew a mixed reaction  from the semiconductor industry. United

      <P>The U.S. sale of 30 AH-64D Apache Longbow attack helicopters to Taiwan is
expected to be finalized in May, a weekly said here Monday.</P>
      <P>The Defense  News reported  in a story from Taipei  that representatives of the
U.S. government and the helicopters' U.S. manufacturer, Boeing Co., will arrive
in Taipei in May to wrap up the deal.</P>
      <P>The weekly said that although there had been speculation that Beijing might
force Boeing to cancel or delay the sale, the deal, announced by the U.S. in
2008, is expected to remain in place.</P>
      <P>It quoted Rupert Hammond-Chambers, president of the U.S.-Taiwan Business
Council, as saying that the Apaches, to be equipped with Stinger Block I air-to-
air missiles and AGM-114L Longbow Hellfire air-to-surface missiles, will begin
to arrive in Taiwan between the end of 2012 and the beginning of 2013.</P>
      <P>The helicopters were originally offered by the United States to Taiwan in 2002,
but the U.S. Defense Security Cooperation Agency did not formally notify
Congress of the sale until October 2008.</P>

      <P>system is flawed because it unfairly favors the rich, the problem with the
proposed second-generation NHI lies in its desperation to become a "Robin Hood"
who robs the rich to give to the poor.</P>
      <P>Under the government's second-generation NHI plan, premiums would be calculated
based purely on total household income. Families with identical income levels
would be charged the same premiums no matter how many members each family has.
This has drawn criticism because it would "punish singles."</P>
      <P>We support the idea of having those who earn more to pay more. However, the goal
should be achieved in a fair and reasonable manner. If the new plan were to use
"total personal income" instead of "total household income" as the basis to
calculate premiums, the situation would be greatly improved.</P>
      <P>Under our proposal, the premium of each individual covered by the compulsory
insurance program would be calculated based on his or her total income, with
low-income earners and those having no income charged a basic premium of NT$300
per month.</P>
      <P>If the premium rate were set at 5 percent, a family of four supported by a sole
breadwinner earning NT$80,000 a month would have to pay NT$2,100 (NT$1,200 +
NT$900 for the three dependents) in premiums per month. A single individual
earning NT$80,000 would pay NT$1,200. (Each individual pays 30 percent of the
total premium. The individual's employer and the government pick up the
balance.)</P>
      <P>This would satisfy everybody and enable the second-generation NHI system to be
introduced early. (April 13, 2010)</P>

      <P>Former Avignon Festival Artistic Director Bernard Faivre d'Arcier and Guimet
Museum curator Jacques Gies received a Taiwan-France cultural award Monday and
were acclaimed as "modern Marco Polos."</P>
      <P>The 14th French-Taiwanese Cultural Foundation Award was presented at the French
Academy, with Michel Albert, permanent secretary of the Academy of Moral and
Political Sciences, Jean Mesnard, head of the Academy of Moral and Political
Sciences, and Taiwan's Council for Cultural Affairs chief Emile C.J. Sheng
jointly hosting the ceremony.</P>
      <P>At the event, Sheng described the award winners as "bridge builders" similar to
the Italian merchant Marco Polo (1254-1324), who introduced Europeans to Central
Asia and China.</P>
      <P>All recipients of the award, which was established in 1996, have made
contributions to boosting the visibility of Taiwanese culture in Europe, Sheng
said.</P>
      <P>In his address, Faivre d'Arcier, awarded for his enthusiasm in inviting
Taiwanese artists and cultural troupes to perform at the Avignon Festival, said
he was not the first person in France that did so, saying it was Patrice
Martinet, artistic director of the Paris Summer Quarter Festival, who was the
real pioneer.</P>
      <P>Faivre d'Arcier invited Taiwan to serve as the theme state of the 1998 Avignon
Festival. In that year, over 200 Taiwanese performers with eight troupes came to
France to demonstrate their skills, and since then, Taiwanese artists have been
regularly featured at the event.</P>
      <P>Gies received the award on behalf of the Guimet Museum in Paris, which has
organized exhibitions to showcase collections of Taipei's National Palace Museum
and National Museum of History.</P>
      <P>Gies was also recognized for his contributions in promoting exchanges and
cooperation between the Guimet Museum and Taiwan's museums and universities.</P>
      <P>The French-Taiwanese Cultural Foundation was established in 1996 under the joint
aegis of the Council for Cultural Affairs and the French Academy to award two
prizes every year for artistic or literary works that shed light on relations
between Taiwan and Europe and contribute to the enhancement of cultural
exchanges between the two.</P>
      <P>Individuals and legal entities from European countries and Taiwan are entitled
to apply for the award, which comes with prize winnings of 25,000 euros (NT$1.07

    <HEADLINE>Talk of the day -- KMT sets tune for corporate income tax</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>The  ruling  Kuomintang  (KMT)
04/13/10  13:23:30
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>legislative  caucus reached a consensus Monday to cut the country's corporate
income tax rate from the current 20 percent to 17 percent, setting the tune for
a controversial industrial innovation bill.</P>
      <P>The consensus, spurred by a push from President Ma Ying-jeou, was not met
favorably by the opposition Democratic Progressive Party, which insists on its
proposal to drop corporate tax rates to 17.5 percent.</P>
      <P>It is not yet certain whether the KMT's tax incentive package will be passed
into law this week or next, but two things are certain if the bill passes.
Government revenues from corporate income tax receipts will fall by at least
NT$34.3 billion a year,  and conventional industries will be the biggest
beneficiary.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from local media coverage of the issue:</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>The KMT version of the 17 percent tax rate also retains a tax credit for R&amp;D
spending and subsidies for small- and medium-sized businesses for hiring
workers.</P>
      <P>The KMT government contended that the 17 percent rate, modeled after
Singapore's,  will help sharpen  Taiwan's  international competitiveness.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Finance (MOF) said the impact of the new measure on tax revenues
will not be as serious as imagined. It argued that although the 17 percent
corporate income tax will cost national coffers some NT$38 billion a year, it
will spur investment demand.</P>
      <P>When profits increase because of the lower tax rate, the government will in turn
levy taxes on those profits, contributing to narrowing the tax revenue gap, the
MOF argued.</P>
      <P>In response to the KMT decision, DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen gave directives to
bar the passage of the KMT proposal.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Yeh Yi-jin called Minister of Finance Lee Sush-der the most
spendthrift manager in Taiwan's history.</P>
      <P>The DPP estimated that if the DPP's proposed 17.5 percent rate is implemented,
with all four targeted tax incentives eliminated, the losses in tax revenue will
be around NT$40 billion a year, but the losses could top NT$90 billion a year if
the KMT version is adopted. (April 13, 2010).</P>
      <P>Economic Daily News:</P>
      <P>If the KMT's tax incentive package clears the legislative floor this Friday, the
statute will be implemented retroactively from Jan. 1 this year.</P>
      <P>It means that when companies pay their income taxes in 2011, they will be taxed
at a 17 percent rate, down dramatically from the 25 percent rate they will pay
in 2010 on 2009 income.</P>
      <P>The tax incentives, representing the greatest concession in Taiwan's taxation
history, are poised to create benefits to the tune of NT$130 billion for the
private sector. (April 13, 2010).</P>
      <P>Commercial Times:</P>
      <P>The 17 percent corporate income tax rate, proposed by the ruling KMT,  which
dominates  the  Legislature,  is poised  to give across-the-board  benefits to
domestic businesses,  particularly conventional industries.</P>
      <P>Some business executives even called it "belated justice."</P>
      <P>Formosa  Plastics,  China  Steel  Corp.,  and Uni-President Enterprises all said
lower corporate income taxes will not only reduce their financial burdens but
also spur fresh investment.</P>
      <P>Formosa Plastics welcomed it as a "constructive policy." The lower tax policy is
definitely a shot in the arm for domestic and foreign businesses in terms of
investing in Taiwan, the company said.</P>
      <P>Lin Ming-ju, chairman of the Taiwan Steel and Iron Industries Association, said
lower taxes will enable businesses to make some profit in this era of tiny
margins. When the companies' finances improve because of the lower tax rates,
they will be able to use the windfall to beef up their production facilities,
which will in turn hone their international competitiveness, Lin said.</P>
      <P>Hung Yao-kun, chairman of the Taiwan Feed Industry Association, said the tax
incentives will help breathe new life into the sector, which has operated in a
low-margin environment due to high taxes. "Now we can survive a little bit
easier, " he said. (April 13, 2010).</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan is set to act on an industrial innovation bill on Friday.
Lawmakers of the ruling Kuomintang, with the support of the party, decided to
lower the corporate income tax to 17 percent and offer employment subsidies to
small- and medium-sized enterprises and tax credits for R&amp;D expenses.</P>
      <P>Their decision is a slap in the face to Finance Minister Lee Sush-der, who
insisted on either keeping the corporate income tax rate at 20 percent or
scrapping all four tax breaks targeted at innovation included in the bill's
original version.</P>
      <P>The bill was mapped out jointly by the Finance Ministry and the Economic Affairs
Ministry with the purpose of promoting industrial innovation. The Economic
Affairs Ministry focused on innovation while the Finance Ministry stressed the
health and fairness of the taxation system.</P>
      <P>That is why the Finance Ministry urged the legislature to opt for either a tax
rate of 20 percent with all four tax breaks preserved, or a tax rate of 17.5
percent, as requested by the opposition Democratic Progressive Party, without
any tax incentives.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, the advice of the Finance Ministry was thrown to the wind by KMT
lawmakers during an inner-party discussion, and the finance minister was forced
to agree with the lawmakers to cut the rate to 17 percent in an attempt to
underbid the DPP.</P>
      <P>If the lawmakers  have their way,  the country's  already deteriorating finances
will take a turn for the worse, and the general public will be forced to pick up
the tab.</P>
      <P>In the face of this crisis, the ministry should warn the public of the
government's financial crisis and debunk the myth that lower taxes will promote
the growth of taxable income, while also stressing the necessity of broadening
the tax base while lowering tax rates.</P>
      <P>Health Minister Yaung Chih-liang won applause for tendering his resignation to
make a case for the necessity to increase national health insurance premium
rates. Will the finance minister follow Yang's lead to defend his proposal?

      <P>Singles should not be punished by the second generation National Health
Insurance (NHI) program that will be introduced and implemented in the future,
ruling Kuomintang Legislator Hsieh Kuo-liang said at a press conference Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Under the government's second-generation NHI plan, premiums would be calculated
based purely on total household income. Households with identical income levels
would be charged the same premium no matter how many family members they have.</P>
      <P>This has drawn criticism because it would force singles to pay proportionately
higher premiums than couples or members of a family.</P>
      <P>Hsieh, who is single himself, said many factors led people to remain single, and
he stressed that being without a spouse was not a crime.</P>
      <P>He appealed to the Department of Health to empathize with the choices of single
individuals and refrain from making them feel stigmatized because of the new NHI
plan.</P>
      <P>Citing figures compiled by the Ministry of the Interior's Population
Administration, Hsieh said there are 5.11 million single people in Taiwan aged
20 or over, not including those who are divorced or have lost a spouse.</P>
      <P>"Since these individuals did not cause the NHI's financial woes, why is the
government asking them to shoulder the responsibility? " Hsieh questioned.</P>
      <P>He also noted that people are getting married later than in the past, with the
average man tying the knot at 31 and the average women at 28 in 2009, an
indication that marriage is not an easy choice.</P>
      <P>In today's difficult economic environment, imposing an even greater economic
burden on singles through a second-generation health insurance plan only makes
it more difficult for people to contemplate marriage, Hsieh contended.</P>
      <P>A Mr. Lin who spoke at the press conference said he has never resisted marriage,
but at a time when prices for many commodities are on the rise while pay levels
remain flat, getting married is hard for him.</P>
      <P>"Higher NHI premiums are pushing my dream of getting married even further away,"
he claimed.</P>

      <P>Examples are rife that Taiwan's Civil Code is shackled by outdated patriarchal
thinking. Among them is a clause that requires that those who seek to change
their family names must prove that their surnames "have an unfavorable impact"
on them.</P>
      <P>On Monday, women's rights activists and 26 legislators jointly put forth a
proposal to amend the Civil Code to grant adults the freedom to change their
surnames and allow a parent to apply for a surname change for a child who has
not come of age "for the best interests" of the child.</P>
      <P>We think the restriction on minors should be removed altogether so that any
requests for a surname change can be approved.</P>
      <P>The legal sector has always been conservative. According to a department chief
in the Ministry of Justice, family names are linked to kinship and inheritance
under the Civil Code, and relaxing the restrictions on the adoption of surnames
would also cause changes in family relationships and inheritances.</P>
      <P>If this is such a big deal, how do other countries do it? In Taiwan, the
household registration authorities keep records of surname changes by
individuals. We wonder if the department chief has heard of a device called a
computer, which was invented decades ago and can store large quantities of data.</P>
      <P>The right to choose one's surname is a basic human right. The government should

      <P>A lower corporate income tax will induce Taiwan citizens who maintain business
operations abroad to repatriate some of their capital, Premier Wu Den-yih said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at press conference on a proposal by the ruling Kuomintang (KMT)
legislative caucus to cut the corporate income tax rate from the current 20
percent to 17 percent, Wu said this would remove one of the two major deterrents
for overseas  Taiwan entrepreneurs -- known as Taishang -- to return.</P>
      <P>The other obstacle is the cost of foreign labor, he said. Currently foreign
laborers are paid in line with the country's minimum wage of NT$17,280 per
month, as stipulated by law.</P>
      <P>The premier said that if the foreign laborer wage issue can be addressed, for
example, by lowering wages to reflect actual take-home pay and to a level on par
with mainland China and Southeast Asian countries, Taishang will probably be
more willing to invest in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>It is no secret that most of the foreign laborers working in Taiwan take home
only between NT$8,000 and NT$9,000 per month and the balance goes to brokers, Wu
said.</P>
      <P>"If the wage issue can be addressed, we can expect Taishang to head home like
schools of salmon, " he said. "We can even expect whales to come home."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, after extensive assessment and deliberation, the Executive Yuan has
decided on the 17 percent corporate income tax rate and referred it to the
Legislative Yuan for screening, the premier said.</P>

      <P>Kaohsiung Medical University Chung-Ho Memorial Hospital in southern Taiwan has
been fined $150 million (US$4.75 million) for fraud on a massive scale, the
Department of Health (DOH) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The fine is the heaviest  ever meted out to any medical institution for this
type of violation since the National Health Insurance system was put in place in
1995.</P>
      <P>DOH Minister Yaung Chih-liang said the point is not so much about "fraudulently
claiming health insurance reimbursement, but about the fact that doing so is a
serious violation of medical ethics."</P>
      <P>Cheng Shou-hsia,  chief of the Bureau of National  Health Insurance(BNHI) , said
the prime suspect, Hsu Shih-cheng, a former director of the Department of
Obstetrics and Gynecology of Kaohsiung Medical University hospital, colluded
with a fraud ring headed by Fu Chien-shen when Hsu was working at the Kaohsiung
Medical University hospital and at the Kaohsiung Municipal Hsiao-kang Hospital.</P>
      <P>The fraud ring worked with 10 hospitals, seven doctors and 20 patients to claim
payments from the BNHI and insurance companies.</P>
      <P>The matter only came to light because one of the seven doctors came forward and
reported the scam.</P>
      <P>According to Cheng, the doctors switched cancer patient specimens and let
"phony" patients undergo chemotherapy treatment as well as surgery, in order to
claim reimbursement on the procedures from the BNHI and insurance companies.</P>
      <P>As a result, the BNHI decided to terminate its contracts with the Departments of
Obstetrics and Gynecology of the Kaohsiung Medical University hospital and the
Hsiao-kang Hospital for one year and three months, respectively.</P>
      <P>However, after considering a request by the Kaohsiung Medical University
hospital for reconsideration of the punishment and the rights of the hospital's
ob-gyn patients, the termination was changed to a fine of NT$150 million.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for the hospital said Tuesday that the case was simply a fraud by a
single doctor, that the hospital is itself a victim of the scam, and that it
will file for administrative relief.</P>
      <P>The spokesman said that Hsu left the hospital in May 2009, but before that date,
the hospital was unaware of his dishonesty and had claimed insurance
reimbursements according to his diagnosis.</P>
      <P>"The hospital regrets the ethical issue of the individual doctor," he added.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's government is moving ahead with a plan to open a new technology
research center to serve as the country's industrial innovation and research
base, according to the Council of Economic Planning and Development (CEPD).</P>
      <P>The plan was approved by the Executive Yuan in November as part of Taiwan's
hopes of promoting innovations in Taiwan's industries through  cooperation
among  industry,  academics  and research institutes.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) will begin in this year to establish the
research and development park in central Taiwan to spur development of the
innovation industry. It plans to invest NT$3.6 billion in constructing the park.</P>
      <P>The ministry will invite domestic research institutes, such as the Institute for
Information Industry and the Industrial Technology Research Institute to open
their innovation and incubation centers in the planned zone in Jhongxing New
Village, Nantou County. Tenants are expected to move in as early as the end of
this year.</P>
      <P>It is hoped that the special innovation park will help with technology upgrades
and innovations of the industries in central Taiwan, said Lin Hao-chu, an
official at the MOEA's Department of Industrial Technology.</P>
      <P>Aside from the innovation park, a market intelligence technology research center
will also be opened in Jhongxing Village, Lin added.</P>
      <P>The new center will be commissioned to develop green intelligence mobile
technologies through cloud computing, Lin noted.</P>
      <P>Under the MOEA assessment, the two facilities will attract 1,450 talents in
advanced research after their inauguration, the CEPD said.</P>
      <P>It noted that at least 115 companies are expected to move or open incubation
centers in the innovation park after its completion.</P>
      <P>Industrial investments in the park and the research center are expected to
generate a production value ranging from NT$15 billion to NT$60 billion a year,
the CEPD anticipated.</P>

      <P>Representatives from Taiwan and South Korea agreed at a conference Tuesday that
they should promote more travel packages for seniors, as well as more study
tours for teenagers, in order to promote tourism on both sides.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan-South Korean tourism exchange conference attracted about 180
representatives from both sides -- the largest number in the past six years to
attend such a conference, the organizer said.</P>
      <P>David Hsieh, deputy director-general of the Tourism Bureau under the Ministry of
Transportation and Communications, said South Korean tourist arrivals have been
growing since January, showing a recovery in the South Korea-Taiwan tourism
business.</P>
      <P>Hsieh pointed out that the total number of visitors from South Korea was 167,641
in 2009 -- down 33.55 percent from the previous year, because of the economic
slump, the H1N1 influenza outbreaks and the depreciation of the South Korean
won.</P>
      <P>However, the depreciating won helped increase the number of Taiwanese people who
visited South Korea, with the number of Taiwanese tourists visiting the country
increasing by 25,000 to reach 388,000 last year, Hsieh added.</P>
      <P>Looking ahead, the year-end Taipei International Flora Expo and a bicycle
festival, as well as a two-year "Taiwan Touch Your Heart" tourism promotion
event, will help the tourism industries on both sides to package more tours and
boost the number of tourists, Hsieh said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A local environmental group has called for a ban on imports of seal oil and
related products from Canada to condemn what they describe as the brutal culling
of the animal permitted by Canadian authorities.</P>
      <P>Chen Yu-ming, a leader of the Environment &amp; Animal Society of Taiwan, told a
news conference Tuesday that Canada allows its fishermen to cull 380,000 seals a
year, even though the seals account for only 5 percent of the fishermen's annual
income.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, the culling process is brutal. Canadian fishermen kill these
seals by knocking them on head with a cudgel and skinning them while they lie
helplessly in a pool of blood struggling to stay alive.</P>
      <P>Chen urged the public to watch a film of the culling shot by the Humane Society
International (HSI) and posted on the group's Web site before buying Canadian
seal products.</P>
      <P>"Many of the seal cubs, which are only one month old, are killed while lying on
the ice and waiting for their mothers to feed them, " Chen said. "The world's
largest massacre of marine mammals takes place every year in Canada."</P>
      <P>Although seals are not listed as an endangered species by the United Nations
Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora,
products using seal ingredients are widely boycotted in the West, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Citing the European Union (EU) as an example, Chen said the EU imposed a ban in
1983 on sales of seal fur in its member states and expanded the ban in 2010 to
cover all seal products.</P>
      <P>The U.S. has banned the import of goods with ingredients from marine mammals
since 1977, and it forbids the trapping, gathering or killing of pregnant
animals or cubs less than eight months old in inhumane ways, even for research
purposes.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has become the fourth leading market for Canadian seal products. From
2003 to 2009, it imported 431,364 kilograms of seal oil, an amount requiring the
killing of 120,000 seals, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Seal oil is rich in omega-3 fatty acids, but its proponents contend that it
provides a higher concentration of the essential fatty acids that reduce the
risk of cardiovascular disease than other fish oils, driving demand for the
product.</P>
      <P>Chen argued, however, that seals need not be killed because every nutrient found
in the seal oil can be obtained from other natural sources.</P>
      <P>She urged the Council of Agriculture to screen the HSI film to raise public
awareness that purchasing Canada's seal products is contributing to their
slaughter.</P>
      <P>An anonymous agriculture official rejected her call, saying that there was no
rule to ban the imports of seal products, including those from Canada.</P>
      <P>"Before the law is revised, we do not have the authority to impose a ban, and we
are not in a position to screen the HSI film, "the official said.</P>

      <P>The Legislative Yuan approved the presidential nominee Huang Shih-ming as
Taiwan's new prosecutor general Tuesday, with Huang promising to work hard to
solve long lingering unsolved crime cases.</P>
      <P>Huang, who served as deputy minister of justice before being picked by Ma for
the new post, will serve a four-year term as the country's top prosecutor.</P>
      <P>His predecessor Chen Chung-ming resigned from the position in mid-January after
being impeached by the Control Yuan. Chen's close relations with politicians and
business people were frowned upon by the government and the public.</P>
      <P>The new prosecutor general said he will meet with members of a special
investigation division under the Supreme Prosecutor's Office in a week to gain
an understanding of the progress of the cases they have been handling.</P>
      <P>Huang said his goal is to close all major cases within two years, including the
scandals surrounding a plane procurement by Taiwan's largest carrier,  China
Airlines; the high-profile pre-election shooting of former President Chen Shui-
bian; and the political contribution cases involving many former ranking
officials in the government administrations of both the ruling and opposition
parties.</P>
      <P>Justice  Minister  Tseng  Yung-fu  immediately  gave  his congratulations to
Huang upon learning he had been confirmed by the legislature. Tseng praised
Huang as a capable and upright prosecutor and voiced hope that he could solve
long unsolved serious crimes soon.</P>
      <P>Huang issued a brief statement, in which he stressed his determination to do a
good job amid high expectations of him from the president and the public.</P>
      <P>In a meeting with Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng later Tuesday, Huang
expressed appreciation for the legislature's support for him and vowed to
fulfill his official duties without any regard for the political affiliations of
those indicted.</P>
      <P>Huang said that he has no political loyalties and emphasized that he handles
cases according to solid evidence.</P>
      <P>"I will also demand prosecutors follow due process of law, adequately and
quickly deal with violent crime cases, increase and improve their prosecution
quality and overhaul the morals among prosecutors," he said.</P>
      <P>Huang was approved by a vote of 75-32 in the legislature, as expected.</P>
      <P>The ruling Kuomintang (KMT) controls 75 seats in the 113-member legislature.
Four lawmakers, two of the KMT, one of the opposition Democratic Progressive
Party and one of the Non-Partisan Solidarity Union, were absent from the voting.</P>

      <P>The Executive Yuan will provide the opposition Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) with information on the proposed economic cooperation framework agreement
(ECFA) with China, but will withhold the details on Taiwan's early harvest list,
Deputy Minister of Economic Affairs Lin Sheng-chung said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, the proposed list for early harvest items that will enjoy
immediate tariff concessions  or waivers under the agreement cannot be disclosed
at present because negotiations with China are still ongoing.</P>
      <P>In preparation for an April 25 debate on the ECFA with President Ma Ying-jeou,
DPP Chairperson Tsai Ing-wen had requested access to the early harvest list
proposed by the government, the draft of the agreement, and any government-
commissioned ECFA assessment reports.</P>
      <P>Ma therefore instructed the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Mainland
Affairs Council Monday to compile the relevant documents and deliver them to
Tsai. The president said that all documents should be open to the public "except
for information  related  to the negotiations with China."</P>
      <P>At the same time, Ma expressed the hope that Tsai will provide data that
justifies her party's opposition to the ECFA.</P>
      <P>Lin Yu-chang, a DPP spokesman, criticized the Presidential Office Tuesday as
"lacking sincerity" for planning to provide the party with unimportant publicity
materials and to withhold the actual data that the party requested.</P>
      <P>Lin also said the DPP's doubts over the ECFA and its call for a referendum on
whether it should go ahead have been widely reported by the media and that the
Presidential Office has no need to ask for further related information from the
DPP.</P>
      <P>Tsai Chi-chang, another DPP spokesman, reportedly described the ruling party as
being "good-for-nothing"  for requesting  such information from the opposition
party.</P>
      <P>In response, Presidential Office spokesman Lo Chih-chiang said the DPP should
not hold a double standard, since it was that party that set the precedent in
which a debater would request information from his or her rival.</P>

minutes. Tapeva also thanked Ma for the fertilizer that the ROC government
donated to the people of the Solomon Islands, which is one of Taiwan's
diplomatic allies.</P>
      <P>The president got to know Tapeva on a state visit to the Solomon Islands late

      <P>Taiwanese students' American Mathematics Competitions (AMC) scores dropped this
year but were still above the world average,  the president  of the Nine-Nine
Cultural and Educational Foundation said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Ho Yang-ming said the results show that no students in Taiwan scored full marks
among the 6,647 contestants -- the first time this has happened in 10 years --
while five students in AMC10 and four students in AMC12 got perfect scores in
the United States.</P>
      <P>"The average score of Taiwanese students in AMC10 was 90.8 which is a drop of
9.9, but the world average was still only 70.8, up 0.4," Ho said.</P>
      <P>Ho said the average score of Taiwanese high school students in AMC12 was 77.9,
while that of vocational high school students was 62.6.</P>
      <P>The AMC, which was established in 1950 and has been used in Taiwan for 10 years,
is the first of a series of competitions for high school mathematics and
includes three levels -- AMC8, AMC10 and AMC12 -- for students in grades 8, 10
and 12. The annual event is held by the American Mathematics Competitions
organization.</P>
      <P>Major universities such as the Massachusetts  Institute of Technology (MIT) are
beginning to take AMC scores as important references in student applications,
since the AMC tests a deeper level of math than the SAT and can help identify
students who are ready for a rigorous undergraduate curriculum, according to Ho.</P>
      <P>"This situation (of Taiwan's poorer showing this year) could be caused by many
reasons, such as the date of the test this year being too close to the local
General Scholastic Ability Test, so some students did not choose to take the AMC
tests, "Ho said.</P>
      <P>Another reason is the questions in the tests are divided between two opposing
extremes -- some are too difficult while some are too easy for the students here
-- such as some questions related to discrete mathematics, which students in
Taiwan do not learn until 11th grade, Ho went on.</P>

      <P>Private sector representatives called on the government Tuesday to squarely face
and address the problems derived from the serious infringement of trade marks
and patent rights by mainland Chinese businesses.</P>
      <P>The local businessmen made the call at a hearing organized by ruling Kuomintang
Legislator Ting Shou-chung on the signing of a cross-Taiwan  Strait  accord on
intellectual  property  rights. Government officials and academics also attended
the hearing to answer questions and make suggestions.</P>
      <P>A Shihlin Electric executive said that his company's trademark, which is
registered in both Taiwan and China, has been appearing on products in China
since 2000 without Shihlin Electric's consent.</P>
      <P>Lin Chih-cheng said his company filed several complaints with the relevant
Chinese authorities about the trade mark infringement, but it took three to four
years before a ruling was obtained.</P>
      <P>"Some complaints were not even heard," he said.</P>
      <P>Chu Juo-yu, a legal affairs manager at the food company Hsin Tung Yang, said it
is a long tiring process to obtain a ruling in China on intellectual property
rights violations.</P>
      <P>"It should be easier for legal authorities in China to establish the ownership
of patent rights now that cross-strait exchanges have improved and expanded,"
Chu said.</P>
      <P>Responding to the businessmen's concerns, Vice Minister of Economic Affairs Lin
Sheng-chung said the intellectual property rights issue will be put on the
agenda of the next round of cross-strait talks between Chiang Pin-kung, chairman
of Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation, and Chen Yunlin, president of Beijing's
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Jerry Gen-yu Fong, professor and director of National Chengchi

      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Tuesday that it was trying to
collect information on the involvement of Taiwanese nationals in an alleged case
of the enslavement of 36 Asians on fishing boats and suspected human trafficking
in Costa Rica.</P>
      <P>The MOFA was responding to reports from media outlets stating that three men and
one woman -- three of which are Taiwanese -- were arrested by the Costa Rican
authorities at the port of Puntarenas and accused of using 36 Asians on two
fishing boats as slave labor. All the suspects were released under their own
recognizance.</P>
      <P>The ministry instructed its embassies in Panama and Nicaragua to monitor the
situation and collect information, as there are no diplomatic ties between
Taiwan and Costa Rica, MOFA deputy spokesman James Chang said.</P>
      <P>Costa Rica severed diplomatic relations with Taiwan in 2007 after maintaining
official ties for almost 60 years.</P>
      <P>"We would like to express our concern from a humanitarian standpoint for the
people abused if the case proves to be true, " he said, adding that although the
four had been released, the Costa Rican authorities were still investigating the
case.</P>
      <P>Costa Rican police Sunday freed the 36 Asians -- 15 Vietnamese, 13 Indonesians,
five Filipinos, two Taiwanese and a Chinese national -- from "inhumane"
conditions aboard two fishing boats, Agence France-Presse (AFP) and local paper
La Nacion reported, adding that the men were allegedly beaten and forced to work
for up to 20 hours a day without pay.</P>
      <P>The case surfaced after nine Vietnamese men escaped by jumping overboard,
swimming to shore and alerting the authorities four months ago.</P>
      <P>Two employees surnamed Espinoza and Wang, and a brother and sister by the family
name of Tseng who are the president and treasurer, respectively, of the Imperio
Pesquero del Pacifico S.A. company, were finally arrested Saturday.</P>
      <P>A local newspaper reported that the three Taiwanese and one Costa Rican were
charged with human trafficking, which in Costa Rica carries a sentence of

      <P>National Taiwan University (NTU) announced Tuesday that it is cooperating with
Fudan University in Shanghai to open an EMBA class for both sides of the Taiwan
Strait.</P>
      <P>The two-year EMBA program is aimed at nurturing talents from mainland China and
Taiwan on business strategy, leadership and effective organization ability.</P>
      <P>NTU Vice President Tang Ming-je said that since the school opened the EMBA class
in 1997, it has already nurtured more than 1,900 members over the years.</P>
      <P>With increased cross-strait exchanges, closer linkage between the two sides of
the Taiwan Strait on advanced learning is inevitable, Tang said.</P>
      <P>Lu Xiongwen, dean of the Fudan University School of Management, said via a video
conference that "Chiwan" -- China+Taiwan -- has become the latest emerging
economy in Asia.</P>
      <P>Lu said that bilateral exchanges would definitely bring more benefits than
unilateral learning, noting that Greater China needs to step up efforts to
nurture more management talents.</P>
      <P>Chen Houn-gee, executive officer of NTU's EMBA program, said that the class will
recruit 30 students from each side of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The students will spend one third of their time in Taipei and two-thirds of the
program in Shanghai so as to learn more about their respective cultural and
business environment.</P>

      <P>While many exhibitors at an automobile component trade show being held in Taipei
are simply displaying their products, a few have chosen to use innovative
methods to attract the attention of visitors.</P>
      <P>Most of the companies at the show merely lined up their products, such as car
lights, steering wheels, car seats or bumpers, on shelves in their booths.</P>
      <P>However, after taking a few steps into the exhibition venue at the Taipei World
Trade Center's Nangang Exhibition Hall, visitors can hear the sounds of air
pumps in the distance.</P>
      <P>The sounds come from a yellow race car in the booth of D2 Racing Sport Co., a
Taiwanese maker of air suspension systems for passenger cars. The car moves up
and down or leans right or left as the driver inside plays a video game.</P>
      <P>"We spent three months remodeling the car to create the effect, " said Linda
Lin, a spokeswoman for the company based in the central county of Changhua.</P>
      <P>"There is an air suspension system on each wheel that allows you to adjust the
height of the vehicle, " she told CNA Monday.</P>
      <P>"You can also use a remote control to change the height, " Lin added.</P>
      <P>The company has more than 10 years' experience  equipping passenger vehicles
with the air suspension system in Southeast Asia, the United States and Europe.</P>
      <P>Another attraction at the show is a car that plays a race car film
simultaneously on 10 screens of different sizes on the inside of the car's doors
and trunk.</P>
      <P>"It took us about a year to design it, " said Jovi Hung, manager of Red Wood
Enterprise Co.'s business department.</P>
      <P>"The car has helped attract many visitors to our booth," he said.</P>
      <P>The 30-year-old company, in fact, sells safety belts and race car seats, mostly
in the U.S. and Europe.</P>
      <P>Two heavy motorcycles set up by Taiwan's Lifetech Energy Inc. and placed close
to the entrance  were also attracting  visitors' attention.</P>
      <P>"One of the bikes, using our company's lithium iron batteries, was the winner of
the TTXGP in the United Kingdom in 2009, " company president Alan Hsu, said,
referring to the world's first zero emissions electric motorcycle race.</P>
      <P>Another heavy motorbike at the venue, albeit with no extra remodeling, is a
Harley-Davidson featuring a light-emitting diode (LED) headlight.</P>
      <P>"The headlight is the result of six years of research, " said Peter Yen of the
Automotive Research and Testing Center based in Changhua.</P>
      <P>"We launched the headlight early this year, and a local company has already
received orders from the United States," he added.</P>
      <P>The LED headlight can give power savings of up to 80 percent compared with a
traditional headlight, Yen noted.</P>
      <P>The show is being held along with an auto electronics show, and the two are
considered to be the largest of their kinds in Asia this year, the organizer
said.</P>
      <P>This focus of this year's shows is eco-friendly products, as demand for green
energy increases, it added.</P>
      <P>Both shows will run until April 15, open only to trade visitors except for the
final two days, when they will be open to the general public.</P>

      <P>A new website for travel and tourism in Taiwan was launched in China Tuesday,
targeting 400 million Chinese Internet users with comprehensive online travel
information about the island.</P>
      <P>The website "Koubei Taiwan"(http: //taiwan.koubei.com/) is aimed at providing
Chinese tourists more complete and useful information about destinations in
Taiwan other than the most well-known popular tourist spots, such as Alishan and
Sun Moon Lake, an operator of the website said.</P>
      <P>Yu Shih-yi, CEO of Taiwan's eDynamics Inc, which was authorized by China's
leading classified listing website Koubei.com to operate the website, said that
Koubei Taiwan, established in China, will strive to help Chinese Internet users
experience Taiwan online.</P>
      <P>"Chinese tourists will be encouraged to visit the website before visiting
Taiwan," the official said.</P>
      <P>The number of Chinese tourists coming to Taiwan is expected to increase to 1.4
million this year from 970,000 in 2009, according to Taiwan's Tourism Bureau.</P>
      <P>As China's Koubei.com has access to 250 million internet users, its subsidiary
site Koubei Taiwan will easily grab those members' attention and create massive
business opportunities, the company said.</P>
      <P>The website provides various listings on popular tourist spots, recreational and
cultural activities, shopping and dining choices, and it also recommends some
theme tours in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Koubei.com at present provides information on 2,864 cities in China and has 50

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan operators display WiMAX applications at trade show</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Six Taiwan operators showcased WiMAX applications in the fields such as
emergency rescue and health care, at a regional trade show that opened in Taipei
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The applications were on display at the Taiwan pavilion at the WiMAX Forum's
Congress Asia, which was held in Taiwan for the first time, April 13-14.</P>
      <P>At the Taiwan pavilion, the WiMAX rescue equipment was displayed on two dummies
dressed as rescue specialists.</P>
      <P>"With this equipment, rescuers can send real-time images to a nearby operation
center as soon as they arrive at the emergency site, " said James Pao, an
executive of Comm Tec Corp. that was commissioned to develop the gear for First
International Telecom Corp.</P>
      <P>"The equipment can also monitor the rescuer's heartbeat and body temperature and
can detect any toxic fumes in the environment, " he told reporters.</P>
      <P>This gear can be used by firefighters, security guards, police, and the
military, he said.</P>
      <P>Another Taiwanese operator, Far EasTone Telecommunications Co., highlighted a
network that can monitor the health of senior people who live in remote areas or
are not very mobile.</P>
      <P>The WiMAX equipment allows such seniors to check their blood sugar and pressure
levels and then transmit the data via a network that would immediately alert a
medical team if there are any irregularities.</P>
      <P>For its part, VMAX Telecom Co. was offering free rides on taxis equipped with
the WiMAX technology that allows passengers to surf the Internet or watch online
videos in the cabs.</P>
      <P>VMAX also showcased a cellphone-based mobile TV service that provides
information on stock markets and sports events such as the upcoming football
World Cup.</P>
      <P>However, these advanced applications have not yet taken off in the wider
consumer market in Taiwan, said Hsieh Ching-tarng, the director of the WiMAX
Forum's office in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Ron Resnick, president and chairman of the WiMAX Forum, said that at the moment
the situation is different in Taiwan than in Moscow, where there is a buzz among
consumers about the advantages of the wireless technology.</P>
      <P>He said it will take a while for such a buzz, or word-of-mouth marketing, to
take off in Taiwan, but when it does it will help speed up the development of
what he described as "fast Internet service everywhere."</P>
      <P>WiMAX is just taking off in Taiwan, but has been growing rapidly in many
countries in the past year, said Johnsee Lee, the president of Taiwan's semi-
official Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI).</P>
      <P>Most of Taiwan's six WiMAX operators obtained their commercial license from the
government between December of 2009 and March this year.</P>
      <P>Established in 2001, the WiMAX Forum now tracks 559 deployments in 147
countries, with estimated coverage of more than 620 million people worldwide,
one third of which are in Asia.</P>
      <P>The annual congress, which was held in Singapore in the last two years,
attracted an estimated 2,500 people, including operators and component and
equipment vendors in the communications field.</P>

      <P>Incumbent Taichung Mayor Jason Hu might be drafted by the ruling Kuomintang
(KMT) to run in the upgraded central Taiwan's Taichung City -- a merger of the
existing city with Taichung County -- in Nov. 27 mayoral elections.</P>
      <P>Quoting KMT Secretary-General  King Pu-tsung after a party meeting, KMT
spokesman Su Jun-pin said Legislator Chi Kuo-tung has expressed willingness to
withdraw from seeking the party's nomination as candidate for the sake of party
unity.</P>
      <P>His withdrawal would mean that Legislator Liu Chuan-chung would be Hu's sole
competitor within the KMT.</P>
      <P>Although the KMT will adopt a "coordination and recruitment" mechanism and
combine the results of public opinion surveys as an important reference to pick
the best candidate for the race, Su said the party will further "coordinate"
with Liu (implicitly meaning that it will be Hu who will represent the KMT in
Taichung).</P>
      <P>The November special municipality elections will also see voting for the mayors
of Taipei City, as well as for Xinbei City (an upgrade of Taipei County),
Kaohsiung City (a merger of the city and county of Kaohsiung, and Tainan City (a
merger of the city and county of Tainan).</P>
      <P>To date, Hu and Vice Premier Eric Liluan Chu might be directly drafted by the
KMT to run in Taichung City and Xinbei City, respectively, analysts said.</P>
      <P>Chu is the only KMT member who has displayed willingness to take part in the
mayoral election in Xinbei City.</P>
      <P>In the case of the nomination process to select candidates in Taipei City,
Kaohsiung City and Tainan City, the KMT is slated to launch public opinion polls
later this month.</P>
      <P>Apart from incumbent Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin, City Councilor Yang Shih-chiu
has also made his bid for Taipei mayor clear.</P>
      <P>In Kaohsiung City, six KMT members, including four legislators -- Huang Chao-
shun, Ho Tsai-feng, Lin Yi-shih and Chang Hsien-yao -- as well as former
lawmaker Su Ying-kui and incumbent Presidential Vice Secretary-General Lai Feng-
wei, have made known their intentions to vie for the mayoral post.</P>
      <P>In Tainan City, meanwhile, former KMT lawmakers Lee Chuan-chiao and Kuo Tien-

    <TEXT>
      <P>Former president of the Republic of Latvia Vaira Vike-Freiberga shared her
observations on various political topics from her unique point of view as a
psychologist Tuesday before concluding a week-long visit to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>All countries are advised to use referendums cautiously because in some cases
people tend to be misinformed, she told reporters, adding that her training in
psychology gave her an advantage as "a good listener" in comparison to other
politicians.</P>
      <P>Vike-Freiberga, 72, visited Taiwan amid heated local debate on whether to hold a
referendum on a proposed Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement (ECFA) between
Taiwan and China aimed at lowering tariffs and relaxing trade regulations.</P>
      <P>Citing the example of a failed ratification of the European Constitution in
France in 2005, Vike-Freiberga said French voters did not vote for the
Constitution not because they did not support the treaty but because they did
not like the government  led by then-President Jacques Chirac.</P>
      <P>The failed first referendum on the Lisbon Treaty in Ireland in 2008, she added,
was a classical case of misinformation because under Irish law the government is
not allowed to promote its policy. The opposition gave the electorate false
information and successfully prevented the passage of the referendum.</P>
      <P>"This is the danger in referendum... It's very easy to mislead them (the voters)
. Psychologically this potential of misinformation of the issue of referendum
makes referendum, I think, an insecure instrument for finding out the true
position of the people, " she said.</P>
      <P>Vike-Freiberga was elected president of Latvia in 1999. In 2003, she was re-
elected for a second term. During her tenure, she played a crucial role in
leading Latvia to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the EU.</P>
      <P>Vike-Freiberga, who has previously been nominated to run for the position of
Secretary-General of the United Nations and for President of the European
Council, declined to comment any further on Taiwan's political relations and
economic initiative with China.</P>
      <P>However, she said she saw nothing but a promising economic future for Taiwan
because the country has always been at the forefront of innovation, development
of high technology, and re-orienting itself to an economy of high value-added
products, which she described as "the only way of survival in a modern world of
free trade."</P>
      <P>In a free trade world, "you cannot protect yourself the way you did before, "
but at the other end of the spectrum Taiwan is able to gain the access to the
huge China market and create a huge opportunity, she said.</P>
      <P>In terms of the sensitive agriculture issue, she acknowledged that it has been a
complicated issue and "one of the thorniest problems in the world, which
everyone has to face."</P>
      <P>"Any country has to think about having enough food to feed its people in case
something happens. To some extent, each country has to produce some food, " she
said, adding that this is why farmers in the EU are so heavily subsidized.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) said Tuesday that to meet the needs of
different manufacturing sectors, the current three-tier system for hiring
foreign labor will be changed, with the labor-intensive industries getting the
highest ratio of foreign laborers.</P>
      <P>Under the proposed change, high-tech manufacturers will see their ratio for
foreign laborers compared to locals drop to 10 percent from the present 15
percent.</P>
      <P>However, those in the 3K industries -- referring to dirty, dangerous and
demanding working conditions -- the ratio will be increased from the present 20
percent to 35 percent.</P>
      <P>The CLA said that it convened a counselling meeting on foreign laborers in
January to discuss whether to adjust the three-tier system -- 15 percent, 18
percent and 20 percent -- to a five-tier system -- 10 percent, 15 percent, 20
percent, 25 percent and 30 percent.</P>
      <P>As those taking part in the meeting were not familiar with the labor situation
in the 3K sector, they decided to make an on-site inspection, after which they
agreed to the change.</P>
      <P>Tsai Meng-liang, section chief of the CLA's foreign labor management, said that
"under the principle of not increasing the total number of foreign laborers, we
have made a more flexible adjustment in the ratio of foreign laborers according
to different trades."</P>
      <P>The measures will be put into practice in July or August at the earliest, he
added.</P>
      <P>The CLA said that the members of the counselling meeting originally worried that
the five-tier system might squeeze job opportunities for local workers, but
after careful calculation, decided that the new system will only create 400
additional jobs for foreign laborers.</P>
      <P>In addition, a single major manufacturer with more than 1,000 local laborers
will see the ratio for employing foreign laborers drop by 1 percent, and if over
2,000 local workers, the ratio will be cut by 2 percent.</P>

      <P>A series of votes might need to be called in legislative meetings from April 16
in a bid to swiftly ram an industrial innovation bill through the legislature,
Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>According to Wang, the vote might be held in order to force lawmakers of the
ruling Kuomintang  (KMT)  and the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
to decide the fate of some provisions of the bill upon which the two sides have
been unable to reach common ground.</P>
      <P>Wang, who chaired a round of negotiations between KMT and DPP legislative caucus
members on the bill's latest version earlier in the day, said he will preside
over a new round of negotiations the following day in an attempt to bridge the
remaining differences.</P>
      <P>One critical point on which the two main political parties have failed to reach
agreement is corporate income tax, and the two camps might have to resort to a
vote to decide its fate, according to high-ranking KMT sources.</P>
      <P>As the innovation bill contains 74 clauses, its final passage could be delayed
until an April 20 legislative meeting, they added.</P>
      <P>Lin Yi-shih, a KMT legislative caucus whip, said the party insists on lowering
corporate income tax from 20 percent to 17 percent,  granting innovation
incentives of NT$10 billion, and providing small- and medium-sized companies
with government subsidies for additional workers they hire.</P>
      <P>The DPP, meanwhile, supports a 17.5 percent corporate income tax, and is
strongly opposed to the government subsidy measure on the grounds that it goes
against what the party calls the "innovation sprit."</P>
      <P>DPP caucus whip Ker Chien-ming said his party will never yield to the KMT's 17
percent corporate income tax proposal and he also predicted that an April 16
vote will be unavoidable on the subsidy measure.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CLA opposes delinking of foreign laborer wages to minimum wage</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) said Tuesday that the delinking of foreign
laborers' wages to the country's minimum wage would involve wide-ranging issues
and that the current policy should be maintained.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a labor rights group also said that it "vehemently opposes such a
delinking."</P>
      <P>They were responding to remarks made by Premier Wu Den-yih earlier in the day
that "there is room for discussion on whether to delink the wages for foreign
laborers to the nation's minimum wage."</P>
      <P>Wages for foreign laborers were adjusted to those of the minimum wage for local
laborers of NT$17,280 (US$546.8) in July 2007.</P>
      <P>Many enterprises and legislators have since said that the wages should be
delinked to induce overseas Taiwan businessmen to return to Taiwan and enhance
industrial competitiveness.</P>
      <P>CLA Minister Wang Ju-hsuan, speaking through Pan Shih-wei, a council spokesman,
said the link should not be removed and that the current policy should be
maintained.</P>
      <P>Pan said that if the link is removed, then the Labor Basic Law should be
revised.</P>
      <P>The policy of industrial development and the perception of the international
community should also be taken into consideration, Pan said.</P>
      <P>Chu Wei-li, secretary-general of the National Federation of Independent Trade
Unions, said that only employers of foreign laborers in the manufacturing
industry have the minimum wage problem and that the large number of foreign
caregivers are not covered.</P>
      <P>Entrepreneurs are trying relentlessly to ask the government to delink the
minimum wage, and if they get their way, will introduce massive numbers of cheap
foreign laborers,  squeezing the job opportunities for local laborers, Chu
noted.</P>
      <P>"The federation has long been opposed to such a proposal, " Chu said.</P>
      <P>According to the latest figures from the CLA, foreign caregivers outnumbered
foreign manual laborers in February for the first time ever in Taiwan, 177,926
to 177,210.</P>
      <P>Although the trend reversed in March, with the 180,000 migrant workers in manual
labor jobs slightly outnumbering the 179,000 migrant caregivers, the CLA
official said caregivers will form the backbone of the foreign workforce in the
long run.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Ex-Latvian president offers political insights</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 13 (CNA)
04/13/10  21:16:42
(By Chris Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former president of the Republic of Latvia Vaira Vike-Freiberga shared her
observations on various political topics from her unique point of view as a
psychologist Tuesday before concluding a week-long visit to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>All countries are advised to use referendums cautiously because in some cases
people tend to be misinformed, she told reporters, adding that her training in
psychology gave her an advantage as "a good listener" in comparison to other
politicians.</P>
      <P>Vike-Freiberga, 72, visited Taiwan amid heated local debate on whether to hold a
referendum on a proposed Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement (ECFA) between
Taiwan and China aimed at lowering tariffs and relaxing trade regulations.</P>
      <P>Citing the example of a failed ratification of the European Constitution in
France in 2005, Vike-Freiberga said French voters did not vote for the
Constitution not because they did not support the treaty but because they did
not like the government  led by then-President Jacques Chirac.</P>
      <P>The failed first referendum on the Lisbon Treaty in Ireland in 2008, she added,
was a classical case of misinformation because under Irish law the government is
not allowed to promote its policy. The opposition gave the electorate false
information and successfully prevented the passage of the referendum.</P>
      <P>"This is the danger in referendum... It's very easy to mislead them (the voters)
. Psychologically this potential of misinformation of the issue of referendum
makes referendum, I think, an insecure instrument for finding out the true
position of the people, " she said.</P>
      <P>Vike-Freiberga was elected president of Latvia in 1999. In 2003, she was re-
elected for a second term. During her tenure, she played a crucial role in
leading Latvia to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the EU.</P>
      <P>Vike-Freiberga, who has previously been nominated to run for the position of
Secretary-General of the United Nations and for President of the European
Council, declined to comment any further on Taiwan's political relations and
economic initiative with China.</P>
      <P>However, she said she saw nothing but a promising economic future for Taiwan
because the country has always been at the forefront of innovation, development
of high technology, and re-orienting itself to an economy of high value-added
products, which she described as "the only way of survival in a modern world of
free trade."</P>
      <P>In a free trade world, "you cannot protect yourself the way you did before, "
but at the other end of the spectrum Taiwan is able to gain the access to the
huge China market and create a huge opportunity, she said.</P>
      <P>In terms of the sensitive agriculture issue, she acknowledged that it has been a
complicated issue and "one of the thorniest problems in the world, which
everyone has to face."</P>
      <P>"Any country has to think about having enough food to feed its people in case
something happens. To some extent, each country has to produce some food, " she
said, adding that this is why farmers in the EU are so heavily subsidized.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) said Tuesday that to meet the needs of
different manufacturing sectors, the current three-tier system for hiring
foreign labor will be changed, with the labor-intensive industries getting the
highest ratio of foreign laborers.</P>
      <P>Under the proposed change, high-tech manufacturers will see their ratio for
foreign laborers compared to locals drop to 10 percent from the present 15
percent.</P>
      <P>However, those in the 3K industries -- referring to dirty, dangerous and
demanding working conditions -- the ratio will be increased from the present 20
percent to 35 percent.</P>
      <P>The CLA said that it convened a counselling meeting on foreign laborers in
January to discuss whether to adjust the three-tier system -- 15 percent, 18
percent and 20 percent -- to a five-tier system -- 10 percent, 15 percent, 20
percent, 25 percent and 30 percent.</P>
      <P>As those taking part in the meeting were not familiar with the labor situation
in the 3K sector, they decided to make an on-site inspection, after which they
agreed to the change.</P>
      <P>Tsai Meng-liang, section chief of the CLA's foreign labor management, said that
"under the principle of not increasing the total number of foreign laborers, we
have made a more flexible adjustment in the ratio of foreign laborers according
to different trades."</P>
      <P>The measures will be put into practice in July or August at the earliest, he
added.</P>
      <P>The CLA said that the members of the counselling meeting originally worried that
the five-tier system might squeeze job opportunities for local workers, but
after careful calculation, decided that the new system will only create 400
additional jobs for foreign laborers.</P>
      <P>In addition, a single major manufacturer with more than 1,000 local laborers
will see the ratio for employing foreign laborers drop by 1 percent, and if over
2,000 local workers, the ratio will be cut by 2 percent.</P>

      <P>A series of votes might need to be called in legislative meetings from April 16
in a bid to swiftly ram an industrial innovation bill through the legislature,
Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>According to Wang, the vote might be held in order to force lawmakers of the
ruling Kuomintang  (KMT)  and the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
to decide the fate of some provisions of the bill upon which the two sides have
been unable to reach common ground.</P>
      <P>Wang, who chaired a round of negotiations between KMT and DPP legislative caucus
members on the bill's latest version earlier in the day, said he will preside
over a new round of negotiations the following day in an attempt to bridge the
remaining differences.</P>
      <P>One critical point on which the two main political parties have failed to reach
agreement is corporate income tax, and the two camps might have to resort to a
vote to decide its fate, according to high-ranking KMT sources.</P>
      <P>As the innovation bill contains 74 clauses, its final passage could be delayed
until an April 20 legislative meeting, they added.</P>
      <P>Lin Yi-shih, a KMT legislative caucus whip, said the party insists on lowering
corporate income tax from 20 percent to 17 percent,  granting innovation
incentives of NT$10 billion, and providing small- and medium-sized companies
with government subsidies for additional workers they hire.</P>
      <P>The DPP, meanwhile, supports a 17.5 percent corporate income tax, and is
strongly opposed to the government subsidy measure on the grounds that it goes
against what the party calls the "innovation sprit."</P>
      <P>DPP caucus whip Ker Chien-ming said his party will never yield to the KMT's 17
percent corporate income tax proposal and he also predicted that an April 16
vote will be unavoidable on the subsidy measure.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CLA opposes delinking of foreign laborer wages to minimum wage</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) said Tuesday that the delinking of foreign
laborers' wages to the country's minimum wage would involve wide-ranging issues
and that the current policy should be maintained.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a labor rights group also said that it "vehemently opposes such a
delinking."</P>
      <P>They were responding to remarks made by Premier Wu Den-yih earlier in the day
that "there is room for discussion on whether to delink the wages for foreign
laborers to the nation's minimum wage."</P>
      <P>Wages for foreign laborers were adjusted to those of the minimum wage for local
laborers of NT$17,280 (US$546.8) in July 2007.</P>
      <P>Many enterprises and legislators have since said that the wages should be
delinked to induce overseas Taiwan businessmen to return to Taiwan and enhance
industrial competitiveness.</P>
      <P>CLA Minister Wang Ju-hsuan, speaking through Pan Shih-wei, a council spokesman,
said the link should not be removed and that the current policy should be
maintained.</P>
      <P>Pan said that if the link is removed, then the Labor Basic Law should be
revised.</P>
      <P>The policy of industrial development and the perception of the international
community should also be taken into consideration, Pan said.</P>
      <P>Chu Wei-li, secretary-general of the National Federation of Independent Trade
Unions, said that only employers of foreign laborers in the manufacturing
industry have the minimum wage problem and that the large number of foreign
caregivers are not covered.</P>
      <P>Entrepreneurs are trying relentlessly to ask the government to delink the
minimum wage, and if they get their way, will introduce massive numbers of cheap
foreign laborers,  squeezing the job opportunities for local laborers, Chu
noted.</P>
      <P>"The federation has long been opposed to such a proposal, " Chu said.</P>
      <P>According to the latest figures from the CLA, foreign caregivers outnumbered
foreign manual laborers in February for the first time ever in Taiwan, 177,926
to 177,210.</P>
      <P>Although the trend reversed in March, with the 180,000 migrant workers in manual
labor jobs slightly outnumbering the 179,000 migrant caregivers, the CLA
official said caregivers will form the backbone of the foreign workforce in the
long run.</P>

      <P>We expect to see a rational and professional discussion when President Ma Ying-
jeou debates opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairperson Tsai Ing-
wen on the proposed economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) later this
month. We also hope that both sides will clearly answer the doubts held by the
public.</P>
      <P>What the DPP needs to explain clearly is if Taiwan does not sign the ECFA with
China, then what other methods can it adopt to offset the decline in its export
competitiveness as a result of its exclusion from an East Asian free trade bloc?</P>
      <P>The DPP should also clearly tell us its views on cross-Taiwan Strait economic
and trade ties. If the ECFA is signed by the Ma administration as planned and if
the DPP returns to power in 2012, will the DPP abrogate the ECFA?</P>
      <P>As to the Kuomintang, as a responsible ruler, it cannot report only the good
news and withhold the bad. It should reveal which sectors will be the possible
winners and losers under the future ECFA and what relief measures the government
will provide to help the losers.</P>
      <P>This issue concerns the livelihoods of many people and the survival of many
businesses. The government cannot play down the issue by saying that it has
earmarked so many billions in relief funds. There should be employment measures
for those workers who lose their jobs as a result of the ECFA.</P>
      <P>Also, the government has repeatedly emphasized that the signing of the ECFA will
make possible Taiwan's bids to forge free trade agreements (FTAs) with other
countries. It needs to specify the extent of its effects. Can it make a
commitment as to how long it will take for the bids to succeed and how many FTAs
are in sight?</P>

      <P>Nine earthquakes with magnitudes ranging between 3.6 and 5.1 struck eastern
Taiwan between late Tuesday and early Wednesday, according to the Central
Weather Bureau's Seismology Center.</P>
      <P>Although the quakes were felt by residents in the eastern counties of Taitung
and Hualien, no damage or casualties have been reported, authorities said.</P>
      <P>The first of the nine quakes, a magnitude 4.7 temblor that occurred at 10:29
p.m. Tuesday, was centered 9.8 kilometers northwest of the Chenggong
seismological monitoring station in Taitung County and struck at a depth of 5
km, said Seismology Center Director Kuo Kai-wen.</P>
      <P>The biggest quake of the series, a magnitude 5.1 quake, struck at 4: 49 a.m.
Wednesday at a depth of 10 km. Its epicenter was located around 5.4 km northwest
of the Chenggong seismological monitoring station.</P>
      <P>A magnitude 4.1 aftershock occurred six minutes later at a nearly identical
depth and location. Its epicenter was located 5.5 km northwest of the Chenggong
station, and its focus was at a depth of 9.8 km.</P>
      <P>Kuo said that although the frequency of preshocks and aftershocks was relatively
high, their magnitudes were not strong and the areas affected were limited.</P>
      <P>Even though the main shock reached a magnitude of 5, it lasted for only 1.18
seconds and had little impact on the safety of buildings in the area, Kuo said.</P>
      <P>Noting that the Chenggong area lies where the Eurasian and Philippine Sea
tectonic plates converge, Kuo said the area is earthquake-prone, with the plates
being pushed down an average of 8 centimeters annually.</P>
      <P>By helping release energy building up between the tectonic plates, the latest
series of earthquakes may have helped prevent a potentially larger earthquake
capable of inflicting more serious damage, he added.</P>

      <P>Few higher-income earners affected by the recent hikes in National Health
Insurance (NHI) premiums have expressed opposition to the increases because they
think it is their social obligation to pay more than the poor.</P>
      <P>However, when authorities turn a blind eye to flaws in the system, such as
fraudulent NHI reimbursement claims by hospitals, a lack of transparency in drug
prices, and the refusal by local governments to honor their premium obligations,
how can we ask these higher-income earners pay the higher premiums willingly?</P>
      <P>The Department of Health (DOH)  disclosed Tuesday that 10 hospitals, seven
doctors and 20 patients were allegedly involved in NHI fraud, including
Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital, which was fined NT$150 million.</P>
      <P>This is in fact is only the tip of the iceberg. If all these problems are not
resolved, the hikes in NHI premiums will lose their justification and draw more
and more protests.</P>
      <P>The Bureau of National Health Insurance has the responsibility and obligation to
supervise the disbursement of the premiums we have paid. In particular, those
people who are affected by the hikes should be provided with a fair explanation.

      <P>Bipolar I disorder is a mood disorder defined by the presence of recurrent
episodes of abnormally elevated mood (mania), according to the research team.</P>
      <P>Some patients who experience manic episodes also experience depressive episodes,
or mixed episodes in which features of both mania and depression are present at
the same time.</P>
      <P>The affliction, which affects approximately 1 percent of the world's population,
often interferes with patients' personal lives and affects their ability to
function socially.</P>
      <P>The scientists said the heritability of bipolar I disorder has been estimated to
be around 80 percent and is passed down through multiple genes, but the exact
cause of the disease remains unclear.</P>
      <P>In this study researchers analyzed the genes of 1409 patients with bipolar I
disorder and 1000 normal individuals using high density genotyping technology.</P>
      <P>They linked four genes -- SP8, ST8SIA2, CACNB2 and KCTD12 -- to bipolar I
disorder in ethnic Chinese people, and three of them (SP8, CACNB2 and KCTD12)
were identified for the first time.</P>
      <P>Because SP8 and ST8SIA2 influence the development of the brain, the scientists
said their study supports a model attributing the development of bipolar I
disorder to the growth of the brain or central nervous system.</P>
      <P>CACNB2 and KCTD12 are genes regulating calcium and potassium ion channels, which
also suggested that disorders of the ion channels -- proteins that regulate the
flow of ions across cell membranes -- contribute to the development of bipolar I
disorder.</P>
      <P>"The genes identified in this study pave the way for researchers to elucidate
pathogenic mechanisms for bipolar disorder and perhaps new drug targets for the
disease," Cheng said.</P>
      <P>With the combined effort of public health and medical centers, Cheng hopes that
in the future genetic factors associated with the pharmacological effects of
mood stabilizers can also be identified, leading to advances in health care,
personalized medication, and the prevention of bipolar disorder and suicide.</P>
      <P>The study was the result of a collaboration between the Institute of Biomedical
Sciences and 25 medical centers and psychiatric institutes in Taiwan. A Taiwan
Bipolar Consortium was established by Cheng in 2003 to cement the collaboration
of the many organizations.</P>
      <P>The study was published online in the international scientific journal Molecular
Psychiatry on April 13.</P>

      <P>Taipei-based TransAsia Airways will resume Taipei-Kaohsiung flights May 1 for
the convenience of southern Taiwan travelers who need to make transit stops at
Taipei Songshan Airport during direct cross-Taiwan  Strait flights,  a spokesman
said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Initially, the spokesman said, the carrier will offer one flight in each
direction daily, using a 70-seater ATR-72 turboprop. The southbound flight will
take off from Taipei at 8 p.m. and is scheduled to arrive at Kaohsiung
International airport at 9 p.m.</P>
      <P>The northbound flight will take off from Kaohsiung at 6: 45 a.m. and will land
at Songshan Airport at 7:45 a.m., the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>TransAsia Airways suspended the service 18 months ago amid rising competition
from the high-speed railway.</P>
      <P>"The resumption of flight services is mainly aimed at meeting the demands of
southern Taiwan passengers who want to take TransAsia flights to China from
Songshan Airport, " the spokesman said, adding that the resumption is also part
of preparations to cash in on business opportunities to be generated from the

    <HEADLINE>Talk of the day -- Interviews with President Ma</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>04/14/10  13:23:05
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou's policies to sign a trade pact with China and cut the
corporate tax rate to 17 percent have stirred plenty of controversy. But Ma has
shown little hesitation in explaining his positions in the face of severe
criticism.</P>
      <P>The corporate tax rate reduction became the centerpiece of a bill on industrial
innovation under review in the legislature. The new provision, which was pushed
by Ma, replaced a number of targeted tax incentives in the bill designed to spur
innovation and industrial upgrading.</P>
      <P>On Tuesday, Ma addressed the issues in interviews with Taiwan's two main
business dailies.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts of Ma's interviews with the Economic Daily News and
the Commercial Times published Wednesday:</P>
      <P>Economic Daily News:</P>
      <P>Speaking of the plan to lower the corporate income tax rate from the current 20
percent to 17 percent, which will consequently lead to a decline in the
country's general revenues, Ma said "no policies are perfect."</P>
      <P>"I know there will be gunfire outside, but I must make the decision," he said.</P>
      <P>Opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Legislator Ker Chien-ming
criticized the government's policy reversal and denounced reported talks between
the ruling and opposition parties as "fake."</P>
      <P>"The only thing that's true was the directive of Ma Ying-jeou, " he complained.</P>
      <P>Ker denounced Ma as a disgrace to constitutional politics for publicly getting
involved in legislative proceedings.</P>
      <P>In the interview, Ma stressed that the proposed cross-Taiwan Strait economic
cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) and the industrial innovation bill will
both play crucial roles at the present stage of Taiwan's economy.</P>
      <P>Once the bill clears the floor of the Legislative Yuan, the government's
planned  "special  zones for economic  and trade operations" will more easily
become reality.</P>
      <P>"Once the zones are drawn up and other arrangements made, they will draw
investment from overseas Taiwanese businesses and foreign companies," he said.</P>
      <P>Ma said he believes that the loss in revenue due to the corporate income tax cut
will only be a short term phenomenon. In the longer term, as investment kicks
in, tax revenues will rise, he said.</P>
      <P>Asked whether his government has concrete and effective measures to promote
employment, the president stated that the first thing that needs to be done is
to adjust the country's industrial structure.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is currently actively promoting the development of service sectors, such
as tourism. He expects the number of visitors to Taiwan will surge to 5 million
this year, from 4.4 million in 2009.</P>
      <P>The visits are expected to generate revenues of NT$500 billion for Taiwan in
2010, Ma anticipated.</P>
      <P>Commercial Times:</P>
      <P>Asked about whether signing the ECFA will trigger growth of property prices, Ma
explained that the proposed trade pact does not focus on "investment" but
"trade."</P>
      <P>Acknowledging that overseas funds are expected to flow in after the agreement is
sealed, Ma said the Financial Supervisory Commission and the central bank will
closely monitor the movements of the funds.</P>
      <P>As to the problem of rising prices of residential housing in metropolitan areas,
Ma explained that the government has a program of providing free-interest loans
for young people to buy a home after they get married and have their first
child.</P>
      <P>Under the program, the government has subsidized mortgages for more than 10,000
applicants. "I have demanded the Executive Yuan to open the program to another
10,000 people or so," Ma said.</P>
      <P>Addressing the ECFA, Ma said he hoped the pact will be signed as early as June,
and he reiterated that Taiwan's market will not open its doors to any Chinese
agricultural imports beyond the 1,415 agricultural items that are already
allowed in.</P>
      <P>He also stressed that no issues related to the movement of laborers will be put
on the agenda of the ECFA negotiations and that the agreement will be based on
the principles of "small and necessary."</P>
      <P>Speaking of his upcoming public debate with DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen on the
ECFA issues on April 25, President Ma described Tsai as an "opponent worthy of
respect."</P>
      <P>In the debate, he will not avoid answering questions on Taiwan's sovereignty
amid warming cross-strait relations, Ma noted. The debate is an opportunity for
him and Tsai to explain their thinking on the controversial ECFA, he said.</P>
      <P>He also sees the debate as meaningful because it allows the ruling and
opposition parties to converse with each other on national affairs, Ma said.

    <HEADLINE>Economic Daily News: A big gamble on innovation bill</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The fight over the corporate income tax rate has been what is stalling the
passage of the industrial innovation bill.</P>
      <P>We think the simplest solution to the problem is for the ruling Kuomintang (KMT)
to endorse a simple tax rate of 17 percent or 17.5 percent as proposed by the
opposition Democratic Progressive Party and drop the redundant "17+1+1" package
-- which would lower the tax rate to 17 percent plus offer employment subsidies
to small- and medium-sized enterprises and tax credits for R&amp;D expenses.</P>
      <P>Research and development is the responsibility of businesses in the first place,
and using tax breaks to encourage R&amp;D activities will confuse cause with
effect.</P>
      <P>International data show that even without any R&amp;D incentives, R&amp;D
spending still accounts for a 1 percent share of gross domestic product (GDP) .
The absence of government incentives does not mean businesses will stop
investing in R&amp;D.</P>
      <P>The ruling party's effort to maintain tax credits for R&amp;D spending may
appear to uphold the core idea of industrial innovation. In substance, however,
the move will only expand the government's financial losses and add more
controversy to the bill.</P>
      <P>Doing away with the tax breaks does not mean the government will stop supporting
industry. There are other methods that can be used, such as providing direct
subsidies to selected sectors.</P>
      <P>It is unnecessary for the ruling party to make a big gamble and challenge the
government's financial limits. A 17 percent tax rate is already sufficient to
boost the international competitiveness of Taiwanese businesses and attract an
influx of foreign investors.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) has downgraded its travel alert for
Bangkok to orange from red as the volatile clashes that gripped the Thai capital
over the weekend have dissipated, the ministry said in a statement Wednesday.</P>
      <P>"The downgrade takes effect immediately," the statement said.</P>
      <P>The ministry raised the alert level to red last Sunday as clashes between
security forces and anti-government protesters escalated in downtown Bangkok,
leaving at least 20 dead and 800 others injured.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan's four-tier travel advisory system, a red alert is the highest level
of warning, which advises local people to refrain from traveling to the affected
region. Orange is the second most serious warning level.</P>
      <P>The MOFA statement said it decided to downgrade its travel warning to orange
after the Thai government announced it will no longer use armed security forces
to disperse the "red shirt" demonstrators and because traffic in the Thai
capital has almost returned to normal.</P>
      <P>As protesters still occupy the Phan Fa Bridge intersection and another in the
Ratchaprasong commercial district, the ministry said it has asked the Tourism
Bureau under the Ministry of Transportation and Communications to advise local
travel agencies not to take Taiwanese travelers to those areas.</P>
      <P>The ministry also promised to keep close tabs on the situation in Thailand and
inform the public of up-to-the-minute developments there for the reference of
local would-be visitors.</P>
      <P>Although the confrontation between security forces and protesters has calmed a
bit, the ministry suggested that local people still avoid non-essential visits
to Bangkok, Nonthaburi, Samut Prakan, Pathum Thani, Nakhon Pathom and Ayutthaya.</P>
      <P>For those who are already in Thailand, the ministry said, they should pay
greater attention to their personal safety.</P>
      <P>Those who encounter an emergency situation in Thailand are welcome to dial a hot

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan remains closed to Chinese white-collar workers: minister</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan has never opened its doors to Chinese white-collar workers, Minister of
the Interior Jiang Yi-huah said Wednesday, after lawmakers questioned a
government move to allow Chinese employees in cross-national companies to stay
in Taiwan for longer periods.</P>
      <P>Cross-national  companies  are foreign companies which have operations in Taiwan
and are permitted to staff certain positions in such operations with personnel
from outside Taiwan, some of whom might happen to be Chinese. The government
considers such workers to be in a separate category from Chinese white-collar
workers.</P>
      <P>The National Immigration Agency (NIA) revised its regulations in early  April
to relax  restrictions  on Chinese  workers  in cross-national enterprises who
apply for an extension of the period for which they can work and stay in Taiwan.
Under the amendment, the extended stay was prolonged from one year to three
years.</P>
      <P>The measure was taken to allow enterprises to be more flexible in how they
deploy their workforces, according to the agency.</P>
      <P>However, the amendment, made at the request of industrial and commercial
business groups, triggered concerns among legislators over a possible impact on
local white-collar workers.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the Legislative Yuan, Legislator Lai Ching-te argued that the law
has never banned Chinese people from doing skilled work such as quality control
or providing technical services in Taiwan, and that they can be paid in Taiwan
for work done here.</P>
      <P>"The Chinese employees pose an impact on local white-collar workers, " he
contended at a meeting of the legislature's Interior Administration Committee.</P>
      <P>In response, Jiang explained that the NIA's move did not open the country's
doors to Chinese white-collar workers.</P>
      <P>The restrictions on the Chinese people who come to Taiwan for business
activities are still in place, including that they can only stay in the country
for a maximum of three months, are not allowed to apply for a work permit, and
are prohibited from doing any paid work, the minister said.</P>
      <P>Acknowledging that a growing number of visits by Chinese people for business
activities could have an impact on local workers, their visits, however, also
bring economic benefits to the country, he said.</P>
      <P>Jiang pointed out that in 2008, 33,000 Chinese people came to Taiwan for
business activities. The number increased to 48,000 in 2009, he added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The two major political parties in Taiwan should move toward positive
competition and stop promoting the "politics of hate, " ruling Kuomintang (KMT)
Secretary-General King Pu-tsung has said in a recent interview with a
Singaporean newspaper.</P>
      <P>An example of such politics is the accusation by former Vice President Annette
Lu of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) that President Ma Ying-jeou "does
not know Taiwan" and "does not identify with the Taiwanese people, " King told
Lianhe Zaobao daily in the interview conducted Monday in Taipei.</P>
      <P>The content of the interview was published Wednesday.</P>
      <P>According to King, the DPP used to manipulate the hate between native Taiwanese
and mainlanders  to its advantage,  and such manipulation has since been
expanded to the broader Taiwan-China context.</P>
      <P>In this context, King noted, Taiwan is portrayed as the weaker party that is
bullied by China, and every KMT member like Ma is seen as trying to sell out
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"You may not like Ma, but you have no need to hate him," he said.</P>
      <P>King said the Ma administration will show the people that everything it has done
is in the interests of Taiwan and that the people will be wise enough to make
their own judgment.</P>
      <P>On the year-end mayoral elections in five special municipalities, King
acknowledged there is not a region where the KMT will be 100 percent assured of
winning, and he said the campaigns in Tainan and Kaohsiung would be especially
difficult.</P>
      <P>King said, however, that he has told his colleagues to stay confident, adding
that he will step down if the KMT wins fewer than three of the five races.</P>
      <P>King said that as Ma's senior aide, he will carry through the party chairman's
ideal for reforms to shed the KMT's negative image as a vote-buyer.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih said Wednesday that the opposition Democratic Progressive
Party's (DPP's) arguments against a proposed trade pact with China are flawed,
as the government will not open markets to more Chinese agricultural products or
allow imports of Chinese labor.</P>
      <P>In addition, the government will not lower tariffs on existing Chinese
agricultural products after signing the economic cooperation framework agreement
(ECFA) with China, Wu said during a television interview.</P>
      <P>Wu said that "early harvest lists" drawn up by the two sides for priority tariff
treatment or access will not necessarily include 500 or 600 items at one time,
but would prioritize urgent and necessary items.</P>
      <P>The government will not accept an early harvest list proposed by the Chinese
side that would have an adverse impact on Taiwan, he added.</P>
      <P>While the DPP continually argues that signing an ECFA with China will allow
imports of Chinese agricultural products, Wu said, it was the administration of
former President Chen Shui-bian of the DPP that opened imports of 936 Chinese
agricultural products.</P>
      <P>Wu said that many businesses in the U.S., Europe and Japan hope that the ECFA
can be signed as soon as possible, which would lower Taiwan's tariffs.  He said
foreign businesses would prefer to establish plants or operation headquarters in
Taiwan after the ECFA is signed because it is more democratic and experienced
than China.</P>
      <P>The premier also said that as Taiwan's automobile industry has better technology
and credibility, even China National Heavy Duty Truck Group Corp. is thinking
about setting up plants in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Some Taiwanese food manufacturers have cooperated with Chinese partners to
establish plants in Taiwan and then sell their products made in Taiwan back to
China, he said.</P>
      <P>People have more confidence in products which are made in Taiwan, Wu said,
adding that "MIT (Made in Taiwan) products have higher prices than MIC (Made in
China) ones."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih said Wednesday that the opposition Democratic Progressive
Party's (DPP's) advocacy of a 17.5 percent corporate income tax rate is merely
following one of the options the administration has been considering.</P>
      <P>The premier said that when the Executive Yuan considers an industrial innovation
bill -- which it considers essential to encouraging innovation and investment in
Taiwan -- to replace the Statute for Upgrading Industry that expired at the end
of 2009, it has several options, including cutting the corporate income tax to
17 percent or 18 percent.</P>
      <P>The DPP only picked up one of the options under consideration, and the party has
"no solid basis" for its advocacy, according to Wu.</P>
      <P>The ruling Kuomintang (KMT) legislative caucus decided earlier this week to
lower corporate income tax from 20 percent to 17 percent,  granting innovation
incentives of NT$10 billion, and providing small- and medium-sized enterprises
(SMEs) with government subsidies for additional workers they hire.</P>
      <P>The DPP, meanwhile, supports a 17.5 percent corporate income tax, and is
strongly opposed to the government subsidy measure, on the grounds that it goes
against what the party calls the "innovation sprit."</P>
      <P>The two parties face a possible showdown Friday,  as the legislature  might
decide to hold a series  of votes on the controversial provisions of the
innovation bill.</P>
      <P>The premier said that although corporate income tax cuts will result in tax
revenue losses in the short term, it will increase the nation's international
competitiveness in the long run.</P>
      <P>Finance Minister Lee Sush-der estimated that the tax revenue losses will amount
to NT$34.3 billion (US$1.08 billion).</P>
      <P>Wu noted that the Statute for Upgrading Industry allowed the high-tech industry
to enjoy big tax incentives.</P>
      <P>This will be the first time the government has used a streamlined tax to cover
the high-tech industry, traditional industries and those industries that target
domestic consumption on equal terms so that SMEs will also enjoy the single
lowered tax rate.</P>
      <P>The premier noted that Singapore cut its corporate tax from 18 percent to 17
percent this year, while the corporate tax in Hong Kong is 16.5 percent. The
administration, he added, decided to follow the Singapore model when selecting
the 17 percent rate.</P>

      <P>The amendment would also allow minors to change their surnames without having to
file an explanation in specific circumstances: if their parents get divorced; if
their father or mother does not protect and educate them as required by law; or
if their parents have been dead or missing for three years.</P>
      <P>During the committee's review of the amendment Wednesday, Deputy Justice
Minister Wu Chen-huan expressed concerns that the revision would create  a
security  loophole  in financial  and banking transactions.</P>
      <P>Ruling Kuomintang Legislator Hsieh Kuo-liang said, however, that based on Wu's
logic, if name changes could cause financial security issues, then they should
be banned.</P>
      <P>KMT legislators Lu Hsueh-chang and John Chiang argued that because all citizens
have national identity card numbers to identify them, there was no need to worry
about the potential security implications of the revision.</P>
      <P>The amendment must still be approved by the full Legislative Yuan before it
becomes law.</P>

      <P>The ruling Kuomintang (KMT) kicked off two-day public opinion surveys Wednesday
to gauge support for party members seeking to run for Tainan and Kaohsiung
mayoral seats in the November elections.</P>
      <P>In Tainan City, former KMT lawmakers Lee Chuan-chiao and Kuo Tien-tsai and
incumbent Tainan City Councilor Hsieh Lung-chieh are potential contenders.</P>
      <P>In Kaohsiung City, six KMT members, including four legislators -- Huang Chao-
shun, Ho Tsai-feng, Lin Yi-shih and Chang Hsien-yao -- as well as former
Legislator Su Ying-kui and incumbent Presidential Deputy  Secretary-General  Lai
Feng-wei  have made known their intentions to vie for the mayoral post.</P>
      <P>Results of the surveys will be used by the KMT as a reference in its nomination
procedure to select candidates for the race in five areas -- Taipei City, Xinbei
City, Taichung City, Tainan City and Kaohsiung City -- in the Nov. 27 mayoral
election.</P>
      <P>After the elections, Kaohsiung City will be merged with Kaohsiung County; Tainan
City will merge with Tainan County; Taichung City and Taichung County will
merge; and Taipei County will be upgraded to "Xinbei City." These four special
municipalities will enjoy the same status as Taipei City.</P>
      <P>As incumbent Taichung Mayor Jason Hu and Vice Premier Eric Liluan Chu are likely
to be directly drafted by the KMT for the elections in Taichung City and Xinbei
City, Taipei City is the only remaining slot where the KMT plans to hold opinion

      <P>If two party members receive similar amounts of public support, the KMT has said
it will evaluate the candidates' qualifications and coordinate between them to

    <TEXT>
      <P>Following reports of Premier Wu Den-yih's hope that the fourth nuclear power
plant will begin commercial operations ahead of schedule, state-run Taiwan Power
Co. (Taipower) Chairman Edward K.M.  Chen said Wednesday that "it cannot be
achieved."</P>
      <P>Responding to lawmakers' questions at the Legislative Yuan, Chen explained that
he came up to the conclusion based on the current progress of construction of
the new power plant in Gongliao Township in Taipei County, northern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to media reports, Wu had expressed hope that Taipower could move up
the schedule for the start of commercial operations of the plant from Dec. 15,
2011 to Oct. 10 of that year as part of celebrations for the country's 100th
founding anniversary.</P>
      <P>Chen said Wu did not instruct his company to alter the schedule, although he did
say it would be nice to see the plant, described as efficient in terms of both
economics and reducing carbon emissions, to start operating ahead of schedule.</P>
      <P>According to Taipower's schedule, the plant's first generator will not be loaded
with fuel until Dec. 15 this year and will not begin operating until one year
after that date.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, also at the Legislative Yuan, as frequent reports in the past few
months of earthquakes in other countries have raised concerns among lawmakers
about the safety of nuclear power plants in Taiwan, Atomic Energy Council
Minister Tsai Chuen-horng was asked if the plants can withstand earthquakes and
quake-triggered tsunami.</P>
      <P>In response, Tsai said that all four nuclear power plants were or are being
built based on international standards for earthquake resistance.</P>
      <P>Two of the three existing plants are situated in Taipei County and the third is
in Hengchun, at the island's southern tip.</P>
      <P>Citing research  results released  in 2009 by the Central Geological Survey,
Legislator Chen Shu-huei of the ruling Kuomintang said the first nuclear plant
is located seven kilometers away from a fault line, while the second is only
five kilometers away.</P>
      <P>The third nuclear plant is located only 20 km away from a sea area with many
undersea volcanos, she went on, expressing worry that the damage would be
massive if one of the volcanoes were to erupt, triggering earthquakes.</P>

      <P>A Taiwan orchestra will share the stage with award-winning tenor Andrea Bocelli
at two concerts next month in Hong Kong and Taipei respectively, one of the
organizers announced Wednesday.</P>
      <P>"We are pleased and honored to have an opportunity to perform in Hong Kong with
the renowned tenor, " said Joyce Chiou, the executive director of the
Philharmonica Taiwan, the National Symphony Orchestra (NSO) which is affiliated
with the National Chiang Kai-shek Cultural Center.</P>
      <P>The orchestra will perform with Bocelli May 4 in Hong Kong and at Taipei Arena
May 6, said Niu Hsiao Hwa, the head of Management of New Arts (MNA).</P>
      <P>The concert will open with "Carmen Overture" and will include other pieces such
as Verdi's "La donna emobile -- Rigoletto", Brindisi's "Cavalleria rusticana",
Puccini's "O soave fanciulla -- La Boheme," according to Niu.</P>
      <P>"Bocelli was impressed by the central city of Taichung during a visit in 2008
and is pleased to make his Taipei debut this time around," Niu said.</P>
      <P>Bocelli emerged as a vocal phenomenon in the 1990s, from a piano bar singer to
an internationally renowned tenor. He has since gone on to become one of the
most successful artists of all time, selling over 65 million albums worldwide.</P>
      <P>With one of the most unique voices in the world, his expressed goal is "to
communicate with the listener, to touch his heart in the same way I was touched
as a child by my favorite singers, who made me dream and moved me to tears."</P>
      <P>In recent years, Bocelli has effortlessly straddled the realms of both classical
and popular music, winning an impressive array of prestigious awards, including
a Golden Globe for Best Song, Grammy and Academy Award nominations.</P>

      <P>The chairman and CEO of the world's largest contract manufacturer of
semiconductors, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) , has
reiterated his forecast that the global semiconductor industry's production
value will grow by 22 percent this year, and will continue to increase by 7
percent next year.</P>
      <P>Last month, Chang had revised his 2010 forecast of the industry's growth to 22
percent, up from his January forecast of 18 percent, citing that downstream
clients' demand have been better than expected.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the 2010 Technology Symposium in California Tuesday, Chang
maintained his forecast of 22 percent growth and said that as his company has
been expanding its business, it will increase its number of employees to 29,000
by the end of this year, up from 25,000 at present and 20,000 at the end of
2009, according to a TSMC press release.</P>
      <P>In addition, Chang said that the company will keep developing advanced process
technology to meet customers' demand, with the number of its R&amp;D people
triple compared to the number the company had five years ago. Spending on
R&amp;D was also doubled from five years ago, he said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the company also announced at the symposium -- attended by nearly
1,500 TSMC customers and third-party alliances -- that it will skip the 22nm
manufacturing process node and move directly to a 20nm technology.</P>
      <P>Chiang Shang-yi, senior vice president of TSMC Research &amp; Development, said
that TSMC is expected to enter 20nm risk production in the second half of 2012.</P>
      <P>"We have reached a point in advanced technology development where0we need to be
actively concerned about the ROI (Return on Investment) of advanced technology,
" said Chiang.</P>
      <P>He said that the move to 20nm creates a better gate density and chip
performance-to-cost ratio than a 22nm process technology and makes it a more
viable platform for advanced technology designers.</P>

      <P>Taiwan has sent a letter of condolence and has promised to provide humanitarian
relief to China's Qinghai Province after it was hit Wednesday by a 7.1 magnitude
earthquake that had left at least 400 people dead and 8,000 injured at the
latest count.</P>
      <P>The Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) ,  the semi-official intermediary body set
up to deal with cross-Taiwan Strait exchanges in the absence of official ties
between the two sides, sent the letter of condolences Wednesday, an SEF
spokesman said later that day.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the National Fire Agency said that upon receiving orders, a 23-member
rescue team organized by the agency can leave for the northwestern Chinese
province, an area that is home to 100,000 Tibetans, within hours to begin
carrying out earthquake-relief work.</P>
      <P>The Red Cross Society of the Republic of China also said it had been in contact
with China's Red Cross and was ready to set off for the earthquake-hit region to
provide support and assistance.</P>
      <P>According to Chinese state media reports, 700 paramilitary personnel were
clearing the rubble and trying to rescue people buried in the quake zone, with
another 3,000 troops on their way to the area to assist in search and rescue
efforts.</P>
      <P>One local military official, Shi Huajie, told a local TV station that many
elementary school students had been buried and that rescuers were racing against
time to dig them out from collapsed schoolrooms, sometimes working with their
bare hands.</P>
      <P>"The difficulty we face is that we don't have any excavators, " Shi said. "It is
very difficult to save people with our bare hands, " he added.</P>
      <P>China' Ministry of Civil Affairs has already initiated an emergency budget
program and has sent a task force to disaster affected area, according to media
reports.</P>
      <P>The quake was centered on Yushu County, which has a population of about 100,000,
mostly herders and farmers. Most buildings near the epicenter collapsed in the
quake, according to media reports.</P>
      <P>Tents, medical equipment and supplies and medical workers are in short supply,
according to reports.</P>
      <P>However, the earthquake did not affect the Qinghai-Tibet Railway because it is
about 200 km from the earthquake epicenter, said a local official.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Wednesday that a proposed cross-Taiwan Strait trade
deal is meant to gradually make Taiwan a "duty-free shop" and help it earn a
niche amid global competition.</P>
      <P>Speaking after a weekly meeting of the ruling Kuomintang's (KMT) policy-making
Central Standing Committee, Ma used the metaphor when describing the importance
of the economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"The planned ECFA is meant to transform Taiwan into a duty-free shop in phases
to sharpen the country's overall competitiveness, " he said.</P>
      <P>"But the pact will definitely not touch on opening Taiwan's market to labor or
agriculture products from China," he added.</P>
      <P>The president  suggested local farmers,  in line with the government's policy,
engage in speciality agriculture and promote their products to the rest of the
world, which he said would be very advantageous to them.</P>
      <P>The ECFA has met strong opposition in some parts of central and southern Taiwan
that rely heavily on agriculture. The areas are also traditional strongholds of
the opposition Democratic Progressive Party, which has vowed to block the
agreement with China out of fear that it might seriously harm Taiwan's job and
agricultural markets.</P>

      <P>The question of whether porn films should be subject to copyright protection
hinges on the opinions of local courts rather than on the country's Copyright
Act per se, an intellectual property rights (IPR) official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Wang Mei-hua, director-general of the Intellectual Property Office (IPO) under
the Ministry of Economic Affairs, made the remarks after lawyers representing
Japan's top eight porn companies urged Taiwan earlier that same day to protect
their clients' copyrighted productions against pirating.</P>
      <P>Lawyers retained by the Japanese producers of adult videos (AVs) said at a news
conference that an increasing number of their productions are being sold on the
local black market, aired on cable television channels in Taiwan and distributed
by telecommunications service providers, causing huge revenue losses for the
film makers and distributors.</P>
      <P>Taiwan police do crack down on peddlers of pirated pornography, but they only
punish the sellers for distributing obscene material, not for violating
intellectual property rights, the lawyers said.</P>
      <P>On behalf of the Japanese companies, the lawyers called for negotiations within
one month with local platform and solution providers, cable TV operators and
mobile phone service providers on the issue of authorization. Otherwise, the
attorneys said, they will bring commercial piracy suits against the Taiwanese
platform service providers.</P>
      <P>Chen Chien-hung, one of the lawyers, took issue with a 1999 Supreme Court
ruling, arguing that Taiwan should grant the same copyright protection to
original porn films as to other types of films, regardless of the effect of
adult films on social morals and customs.</P>
      <P>In a copyright lawsuit brought by Japanese porn companies against Taiwanese
pirates in 1999, the Supreme Court ruled that porn films are obscene material
and are therefore not entitled to copyright protection.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the issue, Wang said the Intellectual Property Office agrees with
copyright scholars and experts that intellectual property should be given
copyright protection as long as the material is original.</P>
      <P>However, the decisions on the issue lie with the local courts, Wang stressed,
noting that since the 1999 Supreme Court ruling, the lower courts have followed
that lead in a number of subsequent cases.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Wang said the Supreme Court ruling has not yet become precedent.
"It is not impossible that the tide will turn in favor of porn film copyright
protection... But all this will depend on the local courts... Our bureau will
fully respect the court rulings, "Wang added.</P>

      <P>The Taiwan National Alliance and other pro-localization political groups said
Wednesday that they want to rally 1 million people on June 6 for a protest
against signing a proposed trade pact with China.</P>
      <P>Yao Chia-wen, one of the organizers of the protest and a former chairman of the
opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) , said the groups had made the
decision about the protest at a meeting earlier Wednesday. The Taiwan Society
North and Taiwan Rescue Action Alliance are also ready to launch a series of
activities against the government's  plans to sign an economic cooperation
framework agreement (ECFA) with China, Yao said.</P>
      <P>With the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) having collected more than 260,000
signatures in a campaign for a referendum on the proposed trade pact, Yao said
other Taiwan-centric groups decided to cooperate with the TSU to plan their next
move.</P>
      <P>Media reports said that some people at the meeting suggested the protest
continue until the government agrees to hold a referendum on the ECFA, while
others called for follow-up protests outside the Legislative Yuan and the
Presidential Office building.</P>
      <P>The opposition say the ECFA will cause massive unemployment in Taiwan because
Chinese people will be allowed to work in Taiwan at lower wages. They also say
they have yet to obtain any comprehensive information regarding the pact's
details.</P>

      <P>Department of Health (DOH) Minister Yaung Chih-liang said Wednesday that he
cannot guarantee that a series of frauds in three hospitals, including one under
the jurisdiction of the DOH, will not be repeated.</P>
      <P>"How can I give such a guarantee when there are still thieves around even though
there are a lot of police deployed?" Yaung asked.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks after three hospitals -- Kaohsiung Medical University
Chung-Ho Memorial Hospital and Hsiao-Kang Municipal Hospital in southern Taiwan
and Keelung Hospital under the DOH in northern Taiwan -- were found to have
engaged in fraud on a massive scale to claim health insurance payments from the
Bureau of National Health Insurance (BNHI) and insurance companies.</P>
      <P>The prime suspect, Hsu Shih-cheng, a former director of the Department  of
Obstetrics and Gynecology  of Kaohsiung Medical University hospital, colluded
with a fraud ring to switch cancer patient specimens when he was working at that
hospital and at the Kaohsiung Municipal Hsiao-Kang Hospital.</P>
      <P>Hsu even performed surgery on healthy "phony" patients, removing uteruses,
ovaries and breasts and putting them on chemotherapy regimens.</P>
      <P>The fraud ring worked with 10 hospitals, seven doctors and 20 patients to claim
reimbursement on the procedures from the BNHI and insurance companies. The
matter only came to light after one of the doctors came forward to report it.</P>
      <P>Legislator Ho Tsai-feng of the ruling Kuomintang asked the BNHI to guarantee
that no women will ever be victims and that similar incidents will not take
place in future.</P>
      <P>But BNHI Director General Cheng Shou-hsia said that "no-one would dare to make
such a promise."</P>
      <P>Yaung pointed out that "there are more than 30,000 doctors in Taiwan, so how can
I guarantee that there will be no similar incidents in the future?"</P>
      <P>But the DOH has imposed  what Yaung described  as "steep disciplinary measures"
in a bid to deter such incidents from happening again, Yaung continued.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung Medical University hospital has been given two options: terminate the
contract with the BNHI for one year, or repay an equivalent health insurance
payment of NT$150 million.</P>
      <P>The hospital chose the latter, the steepest fine ever to have been imposed since
the national health insurance system was lunched in 1995, but it also decided to
file for administrative relief, contending that the offenses were the behavior
of an individual doctor.</P>
      <P>Hsiao-Kang Hospital said it would return NT$13.67 million, while the Keelung
Hospital's Surgery Department said it would return NT$80 million.</P>
      <P>Yaung said in a radio interview earlier in the day that it is the right of the
Kaohsiung Medical University hospital to appeal, but the DOH is "100 percent
sure that the hospital will not win with such solid evidence against it."</P>
      <P>In light of the fraud scandal, the DOH will reassess the hospital and if it
receives a failing grade, it could be downgraded from a medical center to a
regional hospital, Yaung added.</P>

      <P>Time is not ripe for Taiwan to hold political talks with China as more time is
needed for the Taiwanese public to forge a consensus on this issue, Premier Wu
Den-yih has told a European magazine.</P>
      <P>In a recent interview with the Greek bimonthly, the "European Business Review",
Wu made the comment as he explained President Ma Ying-jeou's policy towards
China.</P>
      <P>Wu said that President Ma has decided to talk with China on the principle of
"economic issues ahead of political ones, " with no timetable set for political
dialogue.</P>
      <P>Wu said that this is because political talks could not take place until Taiwan
and China can fully understand and trust each other, and more importantly, they
cannot happen until the people on both sides can throw their full support behind
their respective governments to undertake such talks.</P>
      <P>He rejected a proposal by many Chinese scholars that now is the right time for
Taiwan and China to begin talking about political issues, as there already have
been too much economic talks.</P>
      <P>Wu said Taiwan cannot "jump to the political arena in a hurry" as it needs to
establish broader consensus among members of its public. Wu added that closer
cooperation between Taiwan and China in trade, economy, culture and arts would
be crucial to increasing mutual trust.</P>
      <P>On the proposed cross-strait economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA)
that is expected to be signed this summer, but is opposed by segments of
Taiwan's public, the premier said that the pact will give a big boost to Taiwan,
enabling it to build stronger economic links with China, the Southeast Asian
region and the rest of the world.</P>
      <P>Wu insisted that Taiwan cannot afford to be excluded from the economic
integration that is taking shape in Asia. He added that his government is set to
push ahead with the trade deal with China because it would benefit not only
Taiwan and China, but also Asia and the world.</P>
      <P>Taiwan will again take part in this year's World Health Assembly as an observer
in May, thanks to the flexible diplomatic policy that President Ma has adopted
since he took office in May 2008, Wu said.</P>
      <P>He extended his gratitude to the European Parliament for passing a resolution
recently  in support of Taiwan's presence in the International Civil Aviation

      <P>Since its accession to the WTO in 2002, Taiwan has been lobbying Canada for
similar tariff terms but Canada has remained cool to the requests and not made
any goodwill gestures in response, the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA)
official said.</P>
      <P>"When our two countries held an economic and trade consultation conference in
January, Canada finally gave a slight response, but its promise only further
disappointed us," the official sighed.</P>
      <P>At present, Canada allows Taiwan most favored nations (MFN) tariff treatment,
under which tariff rates range between 3 percent and 6 percent.</P>
      <P>In comparison, most of the 1,000-plus items that are given GPT treatment enjoy
zero tariffs. The tariff gap between GPT and MFN for textile goods is 3.51
percent, which has seriously hampered the competitiveness of Taiwan-made
textiles in the Canadian market compared to similar products from South Korea
and China.</P>
      <P>Minister of Economic Affairs Shih Yen-shiang  has directed relevant MOEA
agencies to try every possible means to protest Canada's discrimination against
Taiwan's textile products,  the official said, adding that if necessary, Taiwan
may lodge a protest, or even file a complaint, with the WTO.</P>

      <P>A public campaign endorsed by Taiwan government officials will be launched with
the screening of a television  program to raise awareness  of ocean
preservation, organizers said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The "Happy Ocean Campaign" aims to draw public attention to the deteriorating
ocean environment and pollution in Taiwan ahead of the 40th anniversary of World
Earth Day on April 22, the National Geographic Channel announced.</P>
      <P>Premier  Wu Den-yih  underlined  the  importance  of ocean preservation in
Taiwan, which he called an "ocean country, " at a press conference to promote
National Geographic's program on the beauty of oceans surrounding Taiwan,
scheduled to air on cable television in Taiwan from April 19-30.</P>
      <P>As an ocean country with the sixth-largest offshore fishing industry in the
world, Wu said, Taiwan and its people need to understand more about the ocean
and cherish its valuable resources. A Maritime Affairs Council will be included
in the government structure reform and will start operation Jan. 1, 2013, he
said.</P>
      <P>Environmental Protection Administration Minister Stephen Shu-hung Shen described
the ocean as "the heart of the Earth" while calling on the public to protect the
environment.</P>
      <P>According to the campaign, the extinction of all life forms in the ocean by 2048
is possible if the issues of environmental pollution and overfishing, among
others, are not addressed and resolved in time.</P>
      <P>The campaign encourages young people in Taiwan to document the ocean with
photographs or videos and send their works to the television company, which will
display all those works in three local museums starting from June 8, World
Oceans Day.</P>
      <P>Lin Chiling, one of Taiwan's most popular models, was invited to endorse the
campaign as its ambassador.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's flexible diplomacy not only improves cross-Taiwan Strait relations, but
also enhances mutual trust between Taiwan and the United States, Foreign
Minister Timothy C. T. Yang said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>In the past year, flexible diplomacy consolidated Taiwan's relations with its 23
formal allies and further improved its ties with Japan and the U.S., Yang said
in a keynote speech at a seminar held by National Chung Hsing University in
central Taiwan's Taichung City.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan enjoys an excellent geographic location, Yang said the
government still needs to implement fast and practical diplomatic policies
because of the risk of being marginalized in the economic and trade fields under
the threat of fast-growing China.</P>
      <P>When asked about the proposed economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA)
with China, Yang replied that signing the pact can not only solve tariff issues
but also protect Taiwanese copyrights and competitiveness in China.</P>
      <P>Yang also said that without a growing economy, Taiwan will not be able to
discuss other issues with international societies.</P>
      <P>He also encouraged  university  students  to cultivate  an international
mindset by trying to see Taiwan from a global perspective, instead of just
watching the world from Taiwan's perspective.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A Belgian French-language newspaper has urged the international community to
create more opportunities for Taiwan to participate in international activities,
by taking into consideration the unique situation Taiwan faces, from an economic
point of view.</P>
      <P>The Les Echos made the call in a special report, which it ran April 10-12 and
focused on the economic and political situation of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The article by the newspaper's senior reporter, Patrick Anspach, quoted Benoit
Ryelandt, director of the Belgian Office in Taipei, as saying that the
international community should consider the situation from an economic
perspective.</P>
      <P>The report cites Ryelandt saying that if Taiwan continues to be shut out of
international economic activities, it is bound to be overtaken by other
countries in the region, including South Korea, which is stepping up its
economic development.</P>
      <P>Anspach noted that Taiwan and Belgium cannot send ambassadors to each other's
country because of the lack of formal diplomatic ties. Ryelandt, though a
diplomat, is officially the representative of the Belgian Office in Taipei, not
an ambassador.</P>
      <P>Similarly, Shen Lyushun, Taiwan's vice foreign minister, served as Taiwan's
representative to the European Union and Belgium until leaving his post in
October 2009.</P>
      <P>The report noted that Taiwan has been long excluded from major international
organizations so that it is difficult for Taiwan to develop close diplomatic
ties with other countries.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is proud of being an observer of the World Health Assembly, the policy-
making arm of the World Health Organization, and it is now pushing for
participation in the International Civil Aviation Organization, the report said.</P>
      <P>The report also pointed out that Taiwan is actively seeking to sign a trade pact
with China, citing an official of Taiwan's Government Information Office as
saying that the proposed economic cooperation framework agreement will help
Taiwan to sign free trade agreements with other countries.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Nearly 800 goats infected with goat pox virus (GPV) have been culled at two
ranches in Yunlin County's Siluo Township in central-south Taiwan, animal health
officials said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>"The animals were slaughtered after two goats in the Yunlin meat wholesale
market were found to have symptoms of GPV on April 9, " said Huang Kuo-ching,
deputy director of the Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection and
Quarantine (BAPHIQ) under the Council of Agriculture.</P>
      <P>None of the infected animals had entered the retail market, Huang said, adding
that the two sick goats were spotted by vets during routine health checks.</P>
      <P>Staff members of the Yunlin animal health inspection  and quarantine bureau
immediately traveled to the two problem ranches to examine and test all the
animals there, Huang said. A ban was also imposed on the movement of animals at
both ranches, he added.</P>
      <P>Follow-up tests at the BAPHIQ on samples collected at the ranches confirmed that
the goats had contracted GPV, a highly contagious disease of small ruminants
that is characterized by fever, ocular and nasal discharges. It also causes pox
lesions on the skin and on the mucous membranes of the nostrils, mouth and
vulva. Mortality can be high. Most kids and lambs with the disease tend to die
and the death rate among adult animals is around 50 percent.</P>
      <P>GPV cannot  infect  humans and can be destroyed  at high temperatures, according
to Huang.</P>
      <P>To prevent the spread of the virus, all of the animals on the two farms were
culled and the farms disinfected, Huang said.</P>
      <P>The bureau has already informed the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE)
of the case, he added. According to OIE regulations, Taiwan will be removed from
the list of sheep and goat pox (SGP) affected areas if no new cases are reported
in the next three years.</P>
      <P>The bureau has also launched a nationwide inspection of sheep ranches, which
will be completed by April 16, Huang said. About 200,000 goats and 1,000-plus
sheep are being raised in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Huang said the bureau will immediately procure the relevant medications and
vaccines in order to wipe out the disease as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The bureau is also investigating the source of the infection, Huang said.</P>
      <P>This is the second time that the disease has been reported in Taiwan. The first
outbreak was in July 2008 in northern Taiwan's Taoyuan County, and was believed
to be related to animal smuggling from GPV-affected areas, including Vietnam,
China, Mongolia, Africa and the Middle East, but the exact source is till
unclear, Huang said.</P>

      <P>As baseball is not only the national sport but also a core sporting industry in
Taiwan, the collapse of the country's professional baseball league could cause
30,000 people to lose their jobs, Sports Affairs Council (SAC) Minister Tai
Hsia-ling said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Tai made the comments in a speech at National Chung Cheng University in Chiayi
County, southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Tai said that although she often felt helpless when asked by legislators to
guarantee there will no more game-rigging after five major scandals in the
Chinese Professional Baseball League's 21-year history, she still called for
keeping the league afloat.</P>
      <P>According to Tai, the SAC has mapped out a plan to help resolve unemployment
among retired baseball players.</P>
      <P>The government also plans to set up 12 amateur baseball teams in the coming four
years.</P>
      <P>The sports sector has received less favorable treatment than many industries in
Taiwan, she said, but added that after the launch of the Taiwan Sports Lottery
in 2008, an estimated NT$2.4 billion (US$75.95 million) from it will be used to
promote sports this year.</P>
      <P>Tai also said she will do what she can to foster the development of the sports
industry, create more jobs for former athletes and provide preferential loans
for them. She said she hoped never to have to see athletes on TV calling on the
government to give them jobs.</P>
      <P>To encourage people to exercise regularly, the government will increase the
annual budget for sports from NT$4 to NT$28 per capita and has already allocated
NT$400 million toward a program aimed at building Taiwan into a sports island,
Tai said.</P>
      <P>The government will also issue a sports IC card to promote the industry and is
scheduled to complete the construction and connection of around-the-island
cycling trails in 2013, Tai added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Fragile soil played large part in Siaolin disaster: researchers</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A fragile geological system coupled with torrential rains caused the mudslide
that buried Kaohsiung County's Siaolin Village when Typhoon Morakot hit in
August last year, a research team reported Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Led by Hongey Chen, a professor at National Taiwan University's Geosciences
Department, and Chien-Chih Chen, a professor at National Central University's
Department of Earth Science, the team reported its findings to the National
Science Council.</P>
      <P>Chien-Chih Chen said Siaolin Village was leveled in two stages.</P>
      <P>First, excessive rains brought about by Typhoon Morakot caused the 1,445-meter
Siantu Mountain to begin collapsing at 6: 16 a.m. on Aug. 9.</P>
      <P>The slide, carrying the equivalent of some 23 million cubic meters of mud, silt
and rocks, plunged to a lower area of the mountain above Siaolin and began
building up after about 33 seconds, Chien-Chih Chen said. The entire slide
lasted only 110 seconds and buried Siaolin's northern part, he reported.</P>
      <P>Another cause was debris that clogged the flow of the Cishan Stream, creating a
quake lake that built up and breached its bank in 50 minutes, submerging
southern Siaolin.</P>
      <P>The village was totally devastated by the two disasters and most residents were
unable to escape, Chien-Chih Chen said.</P>
      <P>Some Siaolin villagers survived, but a majority of about 600 were killed.</P>
      <P>In  response  to  widespread  speculation  that  excessive precipitation was the
prime cause leading to the disaster, Hongey Chen stressed that the fragile soil
formation in the region played an important part in the village's burial.</P>
      <P>According to Hongey Chen, as much as 91 million tons of silt piled up in the
Cishan and Laonong streams during the five days the typhoon affected the region.
That was more than 80 percent of the silt that the Gaoping River, a major river
in southern Taiwan, carries a year, he noted.</P>
      <P>The researchers began the probe in the wake of Typhoon Morakot, which was the
worst to hit southern Taiwan in over 50 years. The team examined 144 villages
and townships across the country, 92 of which were found to be unsafe.</P>
      <P>As typhoon season approaches, the research team submitted the list of these
flood-prone villages to the Executive Yuan for its reference.</P>

    <HEADLINE>China universities will not attract many Taiwanese students: MOE</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Education (MOE) said Wednesday that China's latest move of
opening its universities to top Taiwanese students will not attract many
applicants.</P>
      <P>The MOE was commenting on an announcement by China earlier in the day that
Taiwanese senior high school students who score within the top 12 percent in the
scholastic aptitude tests can now apply directly to 123 universities in China
and will only be required to pass an interview.</P>
      <P>Fan Liqing, a spokeswoman for the Taiwan Affairs Office under China's State
Council, said that following China's decision last year to allow top Taiwanese
students to enter its universities, the preparatory work has been now completed.</P>
      <P>But Yang Yu-hui, deputy director of the MOE's Department of Higher Education,
said that currently, Taiwan only recognizes the academic credentials of 41
universities in China, and Taiwanese students who want to pursue higher
education in China should consider carefully whether that would be in their best
interests.</P>
      <P>"Despite China's move to open up so many of its universities, it will be up to
Taiwanese students to decide if they want to study there, " Yang said. If they
decide to go to China, they must remember that Taiwan only recognizes diplomas
from 41 universities there, she stressed.</P>
      <P>In addition, Taiwanese students in the top 12 percentile should be able to gain
admission to top universities in Taiwan, she said.</P>
      <P>Surveys have shown that 70 percent of parents are not willing to let their
children study in China because of political and social order factors, Yang
noted.</P>
      <P>An official of Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) said that the main
consideration will be the overall environment on both sides of the Taiwan
Strait.</P>
      <P>According to MAC Vice Chairman Liu Teh-shun, based on that factor, it is more
than likely that Taiwan will be able to retain its top students.</P>
      <P>He noted that while China is moving to attract Taiwanese students, Taiwan still
maintains various restrictions regarding Chinese students. For example, they are
not eligible for scholarships and are not allowed to moonlight or seek jobs in
Taiwan after graduation, Liu said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, several prestigious universities said that China's opening of its
universities to Taiwan students is an inevitable trend, but they expressed full
confidence in the quality of Taiwan's universities.</P>
      <P>Chiang Been-huang, Dean of National Taiwan University's Academic Affairs Office,
said that top students will only be attracted to top quality schools.</P>
      <P>Chiang said he is not worried about an exodus of top Taiwanese students to China
as he thinks that it is only under certain circumstances, such as if their
parents are working in China, students will consider studying there.</P>
      <P>Lin Chin-teng, Dean of National Chiao Tung University's Academic Affairs Office,
said that Taiwan's universities still have the competitive edge. However, China
has invested a great deal in higher education,  and Taiwan  universities  will
also need continued government support, he added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, an organization that represents Taiwanese students studying in China
said that the use of Taiwan's scholastic aptitude test score as the basis for
enrolling in Chinese universities will be more convenient for Taiwanese
students.</P>
      <P>But Chen Cheng-teng, vice president of Taiwan Students Union, suggested that the
12 percent threshold should be removed to give all Taiwanese students the option
of studying in China.</P>

      <P>Department of Health (DOH) Minister Yaung Chih-liang said Wednesday that he
cannot guarantee that a series of frauds in three hospitals, including one under
the jurisdiction of the DOH, will not be repeated.</P>
      <P>"How can I give such a guarantee when there are still thieves around even though
there are a lot of police deployed?" Yaung asked.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks after three hospitals -- Kaohsiung Medical University
Chung-Ho Memorial Hospital and Hsiao-Kang Municipal Hospital in southern Taiwan
and Keelung Hospital under the DOH in northern Taiwan -- were found to have
engaged in fraud on a massive scale to claim health insurance payments from the
Bureau of National Health Insurance (BNHI) and insurance companies.</P>
      <P>The prime suspect, Hsu Shih-cheng, a former director of the Department  of
Obstetrics and Gynecology  of Kaohsiung Medical University hospital, colluded
with a fraud ring to switch cancer patient specimens when he was working at that
hospital and at the Kaohsiung Municipal Hsiao-Kang Hospital.</P>
      <P>Hsu even performed surgery on healthy "phony" patients, removing uteruses,
ovaries and breasts and putting them on chemotherapy regimens.</P>
      <P>The fraud ring worked with 10 hospitals, seven doctors and 20 patients to claim
reimbursement on the procedures from the BNHI and insurance companies. The
matter only came to light after one of the doctors came forward to report it.</P>
      <P>Legislator Ho Tsai-feng of the ruling Kuomintang asked the BNHI to guarantee
that no women will ever be victims and that similar incidents will not take
place in future.</P>
      <P>But BNHI Director General Cheng Shou-hsia said that "no-one would dare to make
such a promise."</P>
      <P>Yaung pointed out that "there are more than 30,000 doctors in Taiwan, so how can
I guarantee that there will be no similar incidents in the future?"</P>
      <P>But the DOH has imposed  what Yaung described  as "steep disciplinary measures"
in a bid to deter such incidents from happening again, Yaung continued.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung Medical University hospital has been given two options: terminate the
contract with the BNHI for one year, or repay an equivalent health insurance
payment of NT$150 million.</P>
      <P>The hospital chose the latter, the steepest fine ever to have been imposed since
the national health insurance system was lunched in 1995, but it also decided to
file for administrative relief, contending that the offenses were the behavior
of an individual doctor.</P>
      <P>Hsiao-Kang Hospital said it would return NT$13.67 million, while the Keelung
Hospital's Surgery Department said it would return NT$80 million.</P>
      <P>Yaung said in a radio interview earlier in the day that it is the right of the
Kaohsiung Medical University hospital to appeal, but the DOH is "100 percent
sure that the hospital will not win with such solid evidence against it."</P>
      <P>In light of the fraud scandal, the DOH will reassess the hospital and if it
receives a failing grade, it could be downgraded from a medical center to a
regional hospital, Yaung added.</P>

      <P>Time is not ripe for Taiwan to hold political talks with China as more time is
needed for the Taiwanese public to forge a consensus on this issue, Premier Wu
Den-yih has told a European magazine.</P>
      <P>In a recent interview with the Greek bimonthly, the "European Business Review",
Wu made the comment as he explained President Ma Ying-jeou's policy towards
China.</P>
      <P>Wu said that President Ma has decided to talk with China on the principle of
"economic issues ahead of political ones, " with no timetable set for political
dialogue.</P>
      <P>Wu said that this is because political talks could not take place until Taiwan
and China can fully understand and trust each other, and more importantly, they
cannot happen until the people on both sides can throw their full support behind
their respective governments to undertake such talks.</P>
      <P>He rejected a proposal by many Chinese scholars that now is the right time for
Taiwan and China to begin talking about political issues, as there already have
been too much economic talks.</P>
      <P>Wu said Taiwan cannot "jump to the political arena in a hurry" as it needs to
establish broader consensus among members of its public. Wu added that closer
cooperation between Taiwan and China in trade, economy, culture and arts would
be crucial to increasing mutual trust.</P>
      <P>On the proposed cross-strait economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA)
that is expected to be signed this summer, but is opposed by segments of
Taiwan's public, the premier said that the pact will give a big boost to Taiwan,
enabling it to build stronger economic links with China, the Southeast Asian
region and the rest of the world.</P>
      <P>Wu insisted that Taiwan cannot afford to be excluded from the economic
integration that is taking shape in Asia. He added that his government is set to
push ahead with the trade deal with China because it would benefit not only
Taiwan and China, but also Asia and the world.</P>
      <P>Taiwan will again take part in this year's World Health Assembly as an observer
in May, thanks to the flexible diplomatic policy that President Ma has adopted
since he took office in May 2008, Wu said.</P>
      <P>He extended his gratitude to the European Parliament for passing a resolution
recently  in support of Taiwan's presence in the International Civil Aviation
Organization (ICAO) and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change (UNFCCC) .  (By Tsao Yu-fun &amp; Bear Lee)</P>

      <P>Taiwan may file a complaint with the World Trade Organization (WTO) against
Canada over its long refusal to allow generalized preferential tariffs (GPT) on
Taiwan-made textile products, an economic affairs official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Since 1974, Canada has been giving GPT treatment to more than 1,000 products,
including bicycles, lumber, machine tools, sanitation equipment, steel goods,
eyeglasses, auto parts and textiles, from China, South Korea and several other
countries that are similar to Taiwan in terms of economic development.</P>

      <P>In comparison, most of the 1,000-plus items that are given GPT treatment enjoy
zero tariffs. The tariff gap between GPT and MFN for textile goods is 3.51
percent, which has seriously hampered the competitiveness of Taiwan-made
textiles in the Canadian market compared to similar products from South Korea
and China.</P>
      <P>Minister of Economic Affairs Shih Yen-shiang  has directed relevant MOEA
agencies to try every possible means to protest Canada's discrimination against
Taiwan's textile products,  the official said, adding that if necessary, Taiwan
may lodge a protest, or even file a complaint, with the WTO.</P>

      <P>A public campaign endorsed by Taiwan government officials will be launched with
the screening of a television  program to raise awareness  of ocean
preservation, organizers said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The "Happy Ocean Campaign" aims to draw public attention to the deteriorating
ocean environment and pollution in Taiwan ahead of the 40th anniversary of World
Earth Day on April 22, the National Geographic Channel announced.</P>
      <P>Premier  Wu Den-yih  underlined  the  importance  of ocean preservation in
Taiwan, which he called an "ocean country, " at a press conference to promote
National Geographic's program on the beauty of oceans surrounding Taiwan,
scheduled to air on cable television in Taiwan from April 19-30.</P>
      <P>As an ocean country with the sixth-largest offshore fishing industry in the
world, Wu said, Taiwan and its people need to understand more about the ocean
and cherish its valuable resources. A Maritime Affairs Council will be included
in the government structure reform and will start operation Jan. 1, 2013, he
said.</P>
      <P>Environmental Protection Administration Minister Stephen Shu-hung Shen described
the ocean as "the heart of the Earth" while calling on the public to protect the
environment.</P>
      <P>According to the campaign, the extinction of all life forms in the ocean by 2048
is possible if the issues of environmental pollution and overfishing, among
others, are not addressed and resolved in time.</P>
      <P>The campaign encourages young people in Taiwan to document the ocean with
photographs or videos and send their works to the television company, which will
display all those works in three local museums starting from June 8, World
Oceans Day.</P>
      <P>Lin Chiling, one of Taiwan's most popular models, was invited to endorse the
campaign as its ambassador.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's flexible diplomacy not only improves cross-Taiwan Strait relations, but
also enhances mutual trust between Taiwan and the United States, Foreign
Minister Timothy C. T. Yang said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>In the past year, flexible diplomacy consolidated Taiwan's relations with its 23
formal allies and further improved its ties with Japan and the U.S., Yang said
in a keynote speech at a seminar held by National Chung Hsing University in
central Taiwan's Taichung City.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan enjoys an excellent geographic location, Yang said the
government still needs to implement fast and practical diplomatic policies
because of the risk of being marginalized in the economic and trade fields under
the threat of fast-growing China.</P>
      <P>When asked about the proposed economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA)
with China, Yang replied that signing the pact can not only solve tariff issues
but also protect Taiwanese copyrights and competitiveness in China.</P>
      <P>Yang also said that without a growing economy, Taiwan will not be able to
discuss other issues with international societies.</P>
      <P>He also encouraged  university  students  to cultivate  an international
mindset by trying to see Taiwan from a global perspective, instead of just
watching the world from Taiwan's perspective.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A Belgian French-language newspaper has urged the international community to
create more opportunities for Taiwan to participate in international activities,
by taking into consideration the unique situation Taiwan faces, from an economic
point of view.</P>
      <P>The Les Echos made the call in a special report, which it ran April 10-12 and
focused on the economic and political situation of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The article by the newspaper's senior reporter, Patrick Anspach, quoted Benoit
Ryelandt, director of the Belgian Office in Taipei, as saying that the
international community should consider the situation from an economic
perspective.</P>
      <P>The report cites Ryelandt saying that if Taiwan continues to be shut out of
international economic activities, it is bound to be overtaken by other
countries in the region, including South Korea, which is stepping up its
economic development.</P>
      <P>Anspach noted that Taiwan and Belgium cannot send ambassadors to each other's
country because of the lack of formal diplomatic ties. Ryelandt, though a
diplomat, is officially the representative of the Belgian Office in Taipei, not
an ambassador.</P>
      <P>Similarly, Shen Lyushun, Taiwan's vice foreign minister, served as Taiwan's
representative to the European Union and Belgium until leaving his post in
October 2009.</P>
      <P>The report noted that Taiwan has been long excluded from major international
organizations so that it is difficult for Taiwan to develop close diplomatic
ties with other countries.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is proud of being an observer of the World Health Assembly, the policy-
making arm of the World Health Organization, and it is now pushing for
participation in the International Civil Aviation Organization, the report said.</P>
      <P>The report also pointed out that Taiwan is actively seeking to sign a trade pact
with China, citing an official of Taiwan's Government Information Office as
saying that the proposed economic cooperation framework agreement will help
Taiwan to sign free trade agreements with other countries.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Nearly 800 goats infected with goat pox virus (GPV) have been culled at two
ranches in Yunlin County's Siluo Township in central-south Taiwan, animal health
officials said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>"The animals were slaughtered after two goats in the Yunlin meat wholesale
market were found to have symptoms of GPV on April 9, " said Huang Kuo-ching,
deputy director of the Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection and
Quarantine (BAPHIQ) under the Council of Agriculture.</P>
      <P>None of the infected animals had entered the retail market, Huang said, adding
that the two sick goats were spotted by vets during routine health checks.</P>
      <P>Staff members of the Yunlin animal health inspection  and quarantine bureau
immediately traveled to the two problem ranches to examine and test all the
animals there, Huang said. A ban was also imposed on the movement of animals at
both ranches, he added.</P>
      <P>Follow-up tests at the BAPHIQ on samples collected at the ranches confirmed that
the goats had contracted GPV, a highly contagious disease of small ruminants
that is characterized by fever, ocular and nasal discharges. It also causes pox
lesions on the skin and on the mucous membranes of the nostrils, mouth and
vulva. Mortality can be high. Most kids and lambs with the disease tend to die
and the death rate among adult animals is around 50 percent.</P>
      <P>GPV cannot  infect  humans and can be destroyed  at high temperatures, according
to Huang.</P>
      <P>To prevent the spread of the virus, all of the animals on the two farms were
culled and the farms disinfected, Huang said.</P>
      <P>The bureau has already informed the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE)
of the case, he added. According to OIE regulations, Taiwan will be removed from
the list of sheep and goat pox (SGP) affected areas if no new cases are reported
in the next three years.</P>
      <P>The bureau has also launched a nationwide inspection of sheep ranches, which
will be completed by April 16, Huang said. About 200,000 goats and 1,000-plus
sheep are being raised in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Huang said the bureau will immediately procure the relevant medications and
vaccines in order to wipe out the disease as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The bureau is also investigating the source of the infection, Huang said.</P>
      <P>This is the second time that the disease has been reported in Taiwan. The first
outbreak was in July 2008 in northern Taiwan's Taoyuan County, and was believed
to be related to animal smuggling from GPV-affected areas, including Vietnam,
China, Mongolia, Africa and the Middle East, but the exact source is till
unclear, Huang said.</P>

      <P>As baseball is not only the national sport but also a core sporting industry in
Taiwan, the collapse of the country's professional baseball league could cause
30,000 people to lose their jobs, Sports Affairs Council (SAC) Minister Tai
Hsia-ling said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Tai made the comments in a speech at National Chung Cheng University in Chiayi
County, southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Tai said that although she often felt helpless when asked by legislators to
guarantee there will no more game-rigging after five major scandals in the
Chinese Professional Baseball League's 21-year history, she still called for
keeping the league afloat.</P>
      <P>According to Tai, the SAC has mapped out a plan to help resolve unemployment
among retired baseball players.</P>
      <P>The government also plans to set up 12 amateur baseball teams in the coming four
years.</P>
      <P>The sports sector has received less favorable treatment than many industries in
Taiwan, she said, but added that after the launch of the Taiwan Sports Lottery
in 2008, an estimated NT$2.4 billion (US$75.95 million) from it will be used to
promote sports this year.</P>
      <P>Tai also said she will do what she can to foster the development of the sports
industry, create more jobs for former athletes and provide preferential loans
for them. She said she hoped never to have to see athletes on TV calling on the
government to give them jobs.</P>
      <P>To encourage people to exercise regularly, the government will increase the
annual budget for sports from NT$4 to NT$28 per capita and has already allocated
NT$400 million toward a program aimed at building Taiwan into a sports island,
Tai said.</P>
      <P>The government will also issue a sports IC card to promote the industry and is
scheduled to complete the construction and connection of around-the-island
cycling trails in 2013, Tai added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Fragile soil played large part in Siaolin disaster: researchers</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A fragile geological system coupled with torrential rains caused the mudslide
that buried Kaohsiung County's Siaolin Village when Typhoon Morakot hit in
August last year, a research team reported Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Led by Hongey Chen, a professor at National Taiwan University's Geosciences
Department, and Chien-Chih Chen, a professor at National Central University's
Department of Earth Science, the team reported its findings to the National
Science Council.</P>
      <P>Chien-Chih Chen said Siaolin Village was leveled in two stages.</P>
      <P>First, excessive rains brought about by Typhoon Morakot caused the 1,445-meter
Siantu Mountain to begin collapsing at 6: 16 a.m. on Aug. 9.</P>
      <P>The slide, carrying the equivalent of some 23 million cubic meters of mud, silt
and rocks, plunged to a lower area of the mountain above Siaolin and began
building up after about 33 seconds, Chien-Chih Chen said. The entire slide
lasted only 110 seconds and buried Siaolin's northern part, he reported.</P>
      <P>Another cause was debris that clogged the flow of the Cishan Stream, creating a
quake lake that built up and breached its bank in 50 minutes, submerging
southern Siaolin.</P>
      <P>The village was totally devastated by the two disasters and most residents were
unable to escape, Chien-Chih Chen said.</P>
      <P>Some Siaolin villagers survived, but a majority of about 600 were killed.</P>
      <P>In  response  to  widespread  speculation  that  excessive precipitation was the
prime cause leading to the disaster, Hongey Chen stressed that the fragile soil
formation in the region played an important part in the village's burial.</P>
      <P>According to Hongey Chen, as much as 91 million tons of silt piled up in the
Cishan and Laonong streams during the five days the typhoon affected the region.
That was more than 80 percent of the silt that the Gaoping River, a major river
in southern Taiwan, carries a year, he noted.</P>
      <P>The researchers began the probe in the wake of Typhoon Morakot, which was the
worst to hit southern Taiwan in over 50 years. The team examined 144 villages
and townships across the country, 92 of which were found to be unsafe.</P>
      <P>As typhoon season approaches, the research team submitted the list of these
flood-prone villages to the Executive Yuan for its reference.</P>

    <HEADLINE>China universities will not attract many Taiwanese students: MOE</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Education (MOE) said Wednesday that China's latest move of
opening its universities to top Taiwanese students will not attract many
applicants.</P>
      <P>The MOE was commenting on an announcement by China earlier in the day that
Taiwanese senior high school students who score within the top 12 percent in the
scholastic aptitude tests can now apply directly to 123 universities in China
and will only be required to pass an interview.</P>
      <P>Fan Liqing, a spokeswoman for the Taiwan Affairs Office under China's State
Council, said that following China's decision last year to allow top Taiwanese
students to enter its universities, the preparatory work has been now completed.</P>
      <P>But Yang Yu-hui, deputy director of the MOE's Department of Higher Education,
said that currently, Taiwan only recognizes the academic credentials of 41
universities in China, and Taiwanese students who want to pursue higher
education in China should consider carefully whether that would be in their best
interests.</P>
      <P>"Despite China's move to open up so many of its universities, it will be up to
Taiwanese students to decide if they want to study there, " Yang said. If they
decide to go to China, they must remember that Taiwan only recognizes diplomas
from 41 universities there, she stressed.</P>
      <P>In addition, Taiwanese students in the top 12 percentile should be able to gain
admission to top universities in Taiwan, she said.</P>
      <P>Surveys have shown that 70 percent of parents are not willing to let their
children study in China because of political and social order factors, Yang
noted.</P>
      <P>An official of Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) said that the main
consideration will be the overall environment on both sides of the Taiwan
Strait.</P>
      <P>According to MAC Vice Chairman Liu Teh-shun, based on that factor, it is more
than likely that Taiwan will be able to retain its top students.</P>
      <P>He noted that while China is moving to attract Taiwanese students, Taiwan still
maintains various restrictions regarding Chinese students. For example, they are
not eligible for scholarships and are not allowed to moonlight or seek jobs in
Taiwan after graduation, Liu said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, several prestigious universities said that China's opening of its
universities to Taiwan students is an inevitable trend, but they expressed full
confidence in the quality of Taiwan's universities.</P>
      <P>Chiang Been-huang, Dean of National Taiwan University's Academic Affairs Office,
said that top students will only be attracted to top quality schools.</P>
      <P>Chiang said he is not worried about an exodus of top Taiwanese students to China
as he thinks that it is only under certain circumstances, such as if their
parents are working in China, students will consider studying there.</P>
      <P>Lin Chin-teng, Dean of National Chiao Tung University's Academic Affairs Office,
said that Taiwan's universities still have the competitive edge. However, China
has invested a great deal in higher education,  and Taiwan  universities  will
also need continued government support, he added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, an organization that represents Taiwanese students studying in China
said that the use of Taiwan's scholastic aptitude test score as the basis for
enrolling in Chinese universities will be more convenient for Taiwanese
students.</P>
      <P>But Chen Cheng-teng, vice president of Taiwan Students Union, suggested that the
12 percent threshold should be removed to give all Taiwanese students the option
of studying in China.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Alongside a referendum campaign promoted by the Taiwan Solidarity Union, pro-
Taiwanization groups are planning to gather 1 million people to take to the
streets against the proposed  economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA)
with China.</P>
      <P>Refusal by the administration of President Ma Ying-jeou to disclose details of
the agreement is the main reason why the policy has drawn wide-ranging
discontent. The administration has even turned down the people's request for a
referendum.</P>
      <P>Ma recently told trade union representatives that the ECFA will benefit workers
because tariff waivers provided by the agreement will boost the competitiveness
of Taiwanese products in the Chinese market, which will in turn stimulate
exports and employment. He seemed to completely disregard warnings by experts
that the influx of white-collar Chinese workers to Taiwan will impact the more
than 3 million workers in Taiwan's services sector.</P>
      <P>In order to sign the ECFA, Ma is selling out Taiwan's sovereignty altogether. He
has defined the agreement as one between the "Taiwan area" and "mainland area, "
rather than one between two countries. He is lying to the people by saying that
the ECFA will help reduce the obstruction faced by Taiwan in seeking to forge
free trade agreements (FTAs) with other countries. In the future, Taiwan will
have to obtain China's permission before signing FTAs with other countries.</P>
      <P>The Taiwanese people will soon lose their livelihood and national sovereignty.

      <P>Taiwan's exclusion from regional economic integration is probably the main
reason why exports have been declining, with the country's world ranking in
export volume dropping from 14th to 18th during the eight years the Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) was in power.</P>
      <P>The situation can be attributed to the DPP's adherence to the ideology of Taiwan
independence, which seriously damaged relations with China. As a result, except
for five Latin American allies, other countries refused to negotiate free trade
agreements (FTAs) with Taiwan for fear of offending China.</P>
      <P>Since his inauguration in May 2008, President Ma Ying-jeou has actively improved
cross-strait relations, turning Taiwan from a "troublemaker" into a "peace
creator." After Taiwan signs the proposed economic cooperation framework
agreement (ECFA) with China, the doubts held by other countries with regard to
forging FTAs with Taiwan will clear up.</P>
      <P>However, the DPP, now in the opposition, is vigorously resisting the signing of
the ECFA. The party not only wants a debate on the issue, but is also pushing
for a referendum and planning to take to the streets. Furthermore, it is using
false, sensational statements to stir up the people's emotions and create
conflict.</P>
      <P>The DPP opposes the ECFA because it fears that once the agreement is signed,
Taiwan will regain its economic vigor, boosting Ma's chances for a 2012 re-
election bid and even dampening any DPP hopes of returning to power in 2016.</P>
      <P>Voters have long seen through the DPP's tactics. Unless the party reverses its
course, it will be rejected by the voters again. (April 15, 2010)</P>

      <P>Taipei Songshan Airport, Taiwan's first international airport, will celebrate
its 60th birthday Friday with an elaborate party to usher in its revival as an
important entrance to the capital city, an official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>"The birthday celebration is also part of publicity efforts for the Taipei
International Gardening and Horticulture Exposition slated to open Nov. 6, as
the airport will be a major gateway to the dazzling floral show, " said Wei
Sheng-chih, director of the Taipei International Airport Office under the
Ministry of Transportation and Communications.</P>
      <P>The birthday party will be held near the fountain in front of the mass rapid
transit (MRT) system's Songshan Airport Station, where six 10-tiered cakes will
be cut to mark the occasion, Wei said.</P>
      <P>Mascots of the Taipei International Flora Exposition will join the birthday
celebration to add to the fanfare and festive mood, Wei said, adding that a
series of performances will also be made to promote the upcoming floral expo.</P>
      <P>"With the advent of the gardening and horticulture event, Taipei will definitely
become a global focal point and Songshan Airport will be a main gateway to
various events associated with the exposition... We are organizing the birthday
party to highlight the floral exhibition," Wei explained.</P>
      <P>During the Nov. 6-April 25, 2011 exhibition period, there will be several
special city bus lines to ferry passengers from Songshan Airport to various
exhibition sites, Wei said.</P>
      <P>Songshan airport was inaugurated in 1950 as Taiwan's first international
airport. It used to operate routes to the United States, Europe, Japan, South
Korea and Southeast Asia. Its current building was completed in 1961 when it
ranked among the best in the region.</P>
      <P>The airport has experienced ups and downs over the past six decades. Its
functions as the international airport declined after the inauguration of the
Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport in 1969.</P>
      <P>It got a new lease on life in 1987 when the government adopted an "open sky"
policy to allow for establishment of private carriers. In the following decade,
the airport thrived on booming domestic flight services, with the traffic volume
reached a peak of dealing with more than 15 million passengers in 1997.</P>
      <P>However, the number began a downward streak since 1998 and the opening of high-
spped railway service in 2008 gave the domestic flight service another fatal
blow, with the passenger number falling to slight more than 3.1 million that
year.</P>
      <P>The opening of direct cross-Taiwan Strait flights brought another opportunity to
Songshan Airport. With the inauguration of scheduled cross-strait flights in
August 2009, the number of passengers surged to 3.13 million last year.</P>
      <P>The airport is now undergoing a facelift in preparation for a resurrection  amid
booming  cross-strait  flight  services  and anticipated opening of direct
flights to Tokyo's Haneda Airport and Seoul's Gimpo Airport later this year.</P>

      <P>In an unusually open move, China announced Wednesday it would open its
universities to top Taiwanese high school graduates.</P>
      <P>Fan Liqing, a spokeswoman for the Taiwan Affairs Office under China's State
Council, said preparatory work was complete, paving the way for elite Taiwanese
students to enter 123 universities without having to pass Chinese entrance
exams, starting this fall.</P>
      <P>The surprising gesture met with mixed reactions in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts on the issue carried in Thursday's United Daily News
and China Times:</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>Liu Te-shun, a vice chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council, Taiwan's top China
policy coordinating body, said that top Taiwanese students and their parents
will take into consideration the overall cross-strait environment, including
China's political and social conditions, before making decisions.</P>
      <P>"As far as I know, the Ministry of Education is confident that Taiwan's
universities will be able to retain most of the elite high school graduates
despite China's beckoning," Liu said.</P>
      <P>On Taiwan's preparation for accepting students from China, Liu said amendments
are still pending legislation.  "Even if the amendments are passed into law in
this legislative session, which ends in late June, the Chinese students would
not be able to enroll in Taiwan's universities in time for this fall," he added.</P>
      <P>China's latest move of wooing Taiwan's best students is seen not only as a
"Taiwan-favoring policy, " but also a forward-looking scheme to further
consolidate its national strength.</P>
      <P>With Taiwan's reserved and wavering educational policy, it will witness an
increasing exodus of top Taiwanese students to China, while being unable to
attract elite students from China. This serious imbalance in China's favor will
eventually deplete the country's national strength. (April 15, 2010).</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>China announced that it is ready to accept top Taiwanese students after an
initial decision last year to allow them to enter its universities. One cause
for this was aggressive measures adopted by Hong Kong and Singapore to solicit
elite students from China and Taiwan that have spurred China's "sense of
crisis."</P>
      <P>Wu Hemao, a pundit with Peking University's China Center for Economic Research,
said Taiwan should not be left out of the race if it intends to reform its
higher education system.</P>
      <P>He said university competitiveness is like tectonic plates, which can sometimes
move very quickly. Citing the 2009 world university rankings compiled by
London's Times, he said six Chinese universities entered the top 200 ranks,
while Hong Kong had three and Taiwan had only one.</P>
      <P>Liu Chun-hao, an educator in Taipei, forecast that China's soliciting of
students will not attract many applicants from Taiwan this year, but the
beginning of an exodus of top Taiwanese students to China could be expected next
year "after students and parents are prepared psychologically." (April 15,
2010).</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou expressed his condolences Thursday over the loss of lives
and offered rescue aid after a 7.1-magnitude earthquake hit China's Qinghai
province a day earlier.</P>
      <P>As soon as he learned of the disaster Wednesday, Ma instructed Minister of the
Interior Jiang Yi-huah and the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) to gather
information from Chinese authorities and convey Taiwan's offer to help,
Presidential Office spokesman Lo Chih-chiang said.</P>
      <P>Jiang said the MAC has asked the semi-official Straits Exchange Foundation to
consult Beijing about whether it needs any rescue aid from Taiwan, and Taipei is
currently waiting for China's response.</P>
      <P>A 23-member rescue team organized by the National Fire Agency is on standby and
can depart within hours upon receiving China's consent, he said.</P>
      <P>According to China's state-owned  Xinhua news agency,  the confirmed death toll
from the earthquake -- centered on Yushu County, home to 100,000 Tibetans -- has
risen to 617, with 313 others reported missing and 9,110 injured.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC) , which oversees the
operations of the Taipei mass rapid transit (MRT) system, thinks that the
regulations banning eating and drinking on MRT trains should be retained, an
MOTC official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Legislators Chao Li-yun and Cheng Ru-fen of the ruling Kuomintang proposed
Thursday that the "no eating or drinking" rule be amended to allow passengers to
drink water on the subway because there are people who might need water
regularly for medical or health reasons.</P>
      <P>Responding to the lawmakers' suggestion, Deputy Transportation and
Communications Minister Chang Chiou-chien said the ministry would be inclined to
retain the current regulations, as the Taipei MRT system was designed for short
trips that take an hour at most.</P>
      <P>It is undeniable that the "no eating or drinking" rule has contributed
significantly to the cleanliness of the city's MRT trains, Chang said.</P>
      <P>In addition, it would be difficult for Metro Taipei which runs the Taipei MRT
system to verify whether passengers were drinking water or beverages, given that
many bottled beverages are labeled "water," she said.</P>
      <P>Besides, since the launch of the Taipei MRT system in 1996, Taipei Metro has
never had to fine a passenger for drinking water on the trains, she added.</P>
      <P>"Further consideration would have to be given to the question of whether to lift
the no eating or drinking ban," Chang told lawmakers.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Justice (MOJ) will propose amendments to the Criminal Code
within a year to pave the way for a gradual abolition of the death penalty,
Minister of Justice Tseng Yung-fu said Thursday.</P>
      <P>"We are working  on a raft of measures,  including  life imprisonment without
parole and the establishment of special prisons to house such convicts, in
preparation for the eventual elimination of capital punishment, " Tseng said at
a Legislative Yuan hearing on Taiwan's death penalty policy.</P>
      <P>However, he added that while the MOJ's ultimate goal is to abolish the death
penalty, it has not set a timetable for completion of the process as there is no
public consensus yet on the contentious issue.</P>
      <P>"Our fundamental position is to deal with relevant cases in accordance with the
existing laws, but we will also gradually reduce the use of capital punishment
by introducing substitute penalties, " Tseng told lawmakers from the Legislative
Yuan's Committee on Judicial and Legal Affairs.</P>
      <P>Since the death penalty is still on the country's law books, Tseng said, the
ministry will propose the addition of clauses to the Criminal Code that would
allow for some criminals convicted of violent crimes to be given sentences of
life imprisonment without parole.</P>
      <P>Responding to some lawmakers' worries that such an option may exacerbate the
problem of overcrowding in local prisons, Tseng said the ministry will draft
complementary measures to prevent that from happening.</P>
      <P>"Our draft package will include a blueprint for establishing special
correctional facilities for those who are sentenced to life imprisonment without
parole, " Tseng said. Such convicts will be offered vocational training so that
they would not add to the country's financial burden, he added.</P>
      <P>In addition, Tseng said, the amendment proposals will include broader
compensation as well as educational and employment aid to victims of violent
crimes.</P>

      <P>The Taiwan Confederation of Trade Unions (TCTU) said Thursday that members of
several labor rights groups will take to the streets May 1 -- Labor Day -- to
protest poverty in Taiwan and what it calls the "obviously inequitable
distribution of wealth in the country."</P>
      <P>The demonstration, dubbed an anti-poverty march, will highlight four appeals,
including an appeal for democratic supervision of an economic cooperation
framework agreement (ECFA) that Taiwan is set to sign with China, and that blue-
collar workers' rights should be included in the ECFA talks, said TCTU Chairman
Shih Chao-hsien.</P>
      <P>Shih said many workers see the ECFA as benefiting only big business
conglomerates and their owners,  to the detriment of lower-echelon workers.</P>
      <P>"Without any positive prospects in sight, laborers will take to the streets on
Labor Day to protest President Ma Ying-jeou's administration," he said.</P>
      <P>Another appeal to the government is to forbid dispatched work and oppose service
outsourcing -- under which business owners enjoy lower labor costs because they
do not have to pay benefits, severance or other packages to such workers --
according to Shih.</P>
      <P>The two other appeals will be for "labor union autonomy and opposition to
schemes to destroy labor unions, " as well as "allowing all wage earners to
receive monthly pensions," Shih added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, TCTU Secretary-General Hsieh Chuang-chih said the demonstration will
start at around noon May 1 at the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall in downtown
Taipei and end in front of the Executive Yuan.</P>
      <P>"The demonstrators will be ready for further moves if the Executive Yuan does
not give constructive answers that day, " Hsieh warned.</P>

      <P>Opening Taiwanese universities to Chinese students will allow universities on
both sides of the Taiwan Strait to compete on an equal footing, a Ministry of
Education (MOE) official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Chu Chun-chang, a section chief in the MOE's Department of Higher Education,
said that at present there is an imbalance because China permits Taiwanese
students to enter its universities but as yet there are no reciprocal
regulations in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He called on the public to support the government's plans to allow Chinese
students to study in Taiwan and to recognize Chinese diplomas and degrees.</P>
      <P>Chu made the remarks in the wake of China's latest policy to attract top
students from Taiwan to its universities.</P>
      <P>Under the policy, Taiwanese high school graduates who score within the top 12
percent in Taiwan's General Scholastic Ability Test will be able to apply
directly to 123 universities in China without having to take China's entrance
exams, starting this fall.</P>
      <P>Although the new measure may sound attractive to Taiwanese students, Chu said,
students intending to study in China should be reminded that Chinese diplomas
and degrees are not recognized in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He noted that this policy will remain in place until three related laws -- the
University Act, Junior College Law, and the Statute Governing the Relations
between the People of the Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area -- have been
amended.</P>
      <P>The MOE forecast Tuesday that China's new policy will not attract many Taiwanese
applicants in light of the general distrust of China among people in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to the results of a survey conducted by the MOE, 77.2 percent of
Taiwanese parents are not willing to send their children to schools in China,
based on concerns such as poor public order there, adaptation difficulties, and
the inconsistent quality of Chinese schools.</P>

      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih said Thursday that strengthening crackdowns on counterfeit
drugs and underground radio stations was not meant to suppress freedom of speech
or hurt the pharmaceutical industry, but to protect the public's health.</P>
      <P>Underground  radio stations  in Taiwan sometimes  broadcast advertisements for
fake or substandard medicine, and the premier issued a directive earlier this
year asking authorities to report to him every week from April 1 on the progress
of their crackdowns.</P>
      <P>From Jan. 1 to April 14, police discovered 65 cases involving the sale of
unlicensed drugs and arrested eight suspects, the Ministry of Justice reported
at a Cabinet meeting earlier Thursday.</P>
      <P>The National Communications Commission (NCC) said the number of active
underground radio stations had dropped to 27 as of April 13, compared to a
record high of 190 in 2008.</P>
      <P>The NCC also said that beginning this week, it will work overtime and intensify
its crackdown to include those underground radio stations that broadcast only on
the weekend.</P>
      <P>In addition, the NCC will provide information to the Construction and Planning
Agency under the Ministry of Interior so that illegal radio stations' broadcast-
tower antennas can be removed within a month.</P>
      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) reported that from April 1 to April 13, local

      <P>Teng Hsi-hua, a spokeswoman for the group that is monitoring the NHI program,
said the new system, which will base premiums on total household incomes rather
than the existing system that bases premiums on individual salaries, is expected
to increase the premium basis by 40 percent.</P>
      <P>Therefore, the premium rate -- which currently stands at 5.17 percent -- should
be cut to 3.11 percent under the new system, according to Teng.</P>
      <P>With each individual required only to pay 30 percent of the total premium and
the employer and the government picking up the balance, the actual premium rate
for individuals would be 0.93 percent, she added.</P>
      <P>She said that only those with unearned incomes should be made to pay higher
premiums under the new system and that wage and salary earners and those with
many dependents should not be affected.</P>
      <P>However, if the version of the proposal put forward by the Department of Health
is adopted, even those fresh out of school who perhaps earn only NT$22,000 per
month would see their premiums double, according to Teng.</P>
      <P>In response to her comments, Bureau of National Health Insurance Director-
General Cheng Shou-hsia said the 3.2 percent premium rate is not final and that
the details of the reforms are open to discussion.</P>
      <P>On concerns  that single  individuals  would  have to pay significantly higher
premiums if the household is used as the basic unit of premium calculation in
the future, Cheng said the government has yet to determine the definition of
"household" but he predicted that not many people will have to pay their
premiums independently.</P>

    <HEADLINE>China Times: Policy muddling unhelpful to Ma's rating</HEADLINE>

(April 15, 2010)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The results of the latest Global View Magazine survey shows President Ma Ying-
jeou's approval rating rising only 0.9 percent from the lowest level of 22.9
percent recorded after last August's typhoon disaster, while its disapproval
rating remains at a high of 66 percent.</P>
      <P>Over the past eight months, many things have changed, including the Cabinet
line-up, improvements in major economic indicators and the passage of critical
amendments to the Local Government Law. Why do so many people remain unimpressed
by Ma's performances?</P>
      <P>Perhaps, Ma himself has not discerned what has not changed so far is his policy-
making team, model and mechanism. Take for example the controversial Industrial
Innovation Bill that will soon be put to a showdown vote in the Legislative
Yuan.</P>
      <P>According to media reports, a major policy U-turn on a corporate income tax cut
to be adopted in the bill was made by Ma in a high-level meeting attended by
Vice President Vincent Siew and Premier Wu Den-yih. The Presidential Office
especially issued a news release after the meeting to set the tone on the
contentious tax reduction issue.</P>
      <P>The move seemed to be decisive. However, it lacked an in-depth overview of the
decision's possible impact. Tax losses will be an immediate result that will
exacerbate the government's financial straits. The tax cut apparently favors
corporate owners at the expense of regular taxpayers  and even future
generations.</P>
      <P>Worse still, such a decision was made by the country's top three leaders,
without reference to the 1,000 pages of written opinions presented by the
finance and economics ministries.</P>
      <P>Such a "muddling through" policy-making approach violates the principles of good
governance that require professionalism and policy transparency. Moreover, it
will not help improve the president's approval ratings as he owed the public a
detailed explanation of the reasons for a 3 percent cut on corporate income tax
at a time when the domestic wealth gap is widening significantly.</P>

      <P>A U.S. official said Thursday that a proposed economic cooperation framework
agreement (ECFA) between Taiwan and China will also be beneficial for
Taiwan-U.S. trade relations.</P>
      <P>However, Chris Castro, chief of the American Institute in Taiwan's (AIT's)
Kaohsiung branch, noted in an interview with CNA that Taiwan's stance on the
ECFA is strictly an internal affair.</P>
      <P>The AIT's Kaohsiung office will not interfere in discussions about the ECFA, but
it will support everything that it thinks can foster peaceful development of the
cross-Taiwan Strait relationship, said Castro, who took office in March 2008.</P>
      <P>Castro expressed hope that the political leaders in southern Taiwan will help
protect vulnerable industries and workers, as well as grab new opportunities
once the ECFA is signed.</P>
      <P>AIT will also encourage American architecture firms to seek participation in
many of the important construction projects under way in Kaohsiung, such as a
maritime cultural and pop music center, a passenger terminal at Kaohsiung
Harbor, a trade exhibition and convention center, and a planned marina, Castro
said.</P>
      <P>The Dream Mall in Kaohsiung, Taiwan's largest shopping mall, was designed by a
U.S.-based architecture firm, Castro added.</P>
      <P>In his remaining year in office, Castro went on, he will focus on further
boosting the functions of the Sun Yat-sen America Center, which re-opened last

    <TEXT>
      <P>Siaolin villagers expressed skepticism Thursday over the findings of a research
team that examined the cause of a mudslide that wiped out the village last
August, and they demanded a better explanation of the disaster.</P>
      <P>Hsu Po-yin, chief delegate of a local development association, asked the
government to give a clear explanation of why the soil structure in Kaohsiung
County's Siaolin Village was so fragile that Typhoon Morakot's torrential rains
triggered a massive mudslide that buried the village.</P>
      <P>Hsu said he agreed that the destruction was caused by the mudslide, but he
questioned whether the geological environment in Siaolin Village was really as
unstable as the investigators claimed. "How come the local residents never
noticed that?" he asked.</P>
      <P>Hsu's comments came one day after a research team from National Taiwan
University and National Central University unveiled the findings of their
investigation into the cause of the Siaolin Village disaster.</P>
      <P>In a report to the National Science Council, the team said a fragile geological
system coupled with torrential rains resulted in a mudslide that buried Siaolin
Village during Typhoon Morakot in August last year.</P>
      <P>Chien-Chih Chen, a professor at National Central University's Department of
Earth Science, said the side of the 1,445-meter Siantu Mountain began collapsing
at 6: 16 a.m. on Aug. 9., plunging downhill at a speed of 50 meters per minute.</P>
      <P>The slide, carrying the equivalent of some 23 million cubic meters of mud, silt
and rocks, lasted only 110 seconds and buried the northern area of Siaolin, Chen
reported. On the way downhill, the slide created a debris dam above the village,
he said.</P>
      <P>According to Hongey Chen,  a professor at National Taiwan University's
Geosciences Department, the debris dam in the Cishan Stream broke 50 minutes
after the musdslide, submerging southern Siaolin.</P>
      <P>The village was totally devastated by the two events and most residents were
unable to escape. About 600 villagers were killed.</P>
      <P>As part of its investigation, the research team examined 144 villages and
townships across the country, 92 of which were found to be unsafe.</P>
      <P>The team has submitted a list of the flood-prone villages to the Executive Yuan
for its reference as this year's typhoon season is approaching.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan will vigorously develop the electric car industry with the goal of
creating a production value of NT$120 billion (US$3.8 billion) by 2016, the
Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Deputy Minister of Economic Affairs Hwang Jung-chiou said in a report at the
Executive Yuan on the development of the industry that 10 operational projects
will be launched in the coming three years under five development strategies to
facilitate the development of the local electric car industry.</P>
      <P>The government will allocate a total of NT$9.7 billion over six years to help
speed up the development of electric cars, with the hope that Taiwan will have
one or several of the top 10 electric car makers in the world by 2016. Electric
cars are an irreversible trend amid growing environmental awareness, according
to MOEA officials.</P>
      <P>It also hopes that within six years, domestic sales of electric vehicles will
have topped 45,000 units, with 15,000 exported units, they added.</P>
      <P>In six years, the electric car manufacturing sector is envisioned to be worth
NT$120 billion, while the relevant service sector will be worth NT$31.2 billion,
they continued.</P>
      <P>Combined, the electric car manufacturing and service sectors will create jobs
for some 24,000 people in the same period, they concluded.</P>
      <P>After hearing the reports, Premier Wu Den-yih exhorted the MOEA and other
relevant agencies to cooperate closely to expedite the development of the
industry.</P>
      <P>"Your concerted efforts are needed to allow the local electric car industry to

      <P>Six people, including four elderly Chinese tourists, were injured Thursday in a
boating accident at Sun Moon Lake in central Taiwan's Nantou County, the Sun
Moon Lake National Scenic Area administration reported later that day.</P>
      <P>According to administration officials, a heavy fog that reduced visibility to
less than 100 meters on the lake was suspected as the cause of the accident in
which a boat carrying 26 passengers from northeastern China's Dalian City
collided with a boat carrying 40 Taiwanese tourists.</P>
      <P>The injured were treated at a local hospital for various minor injuries,  the
administration  said,  adding that police  were investigating the accident.</P>
      <P>Sun Moon Lake is one of the most famous scenic spots in Taiwan and is especially

      <P>Department of Health (DOH) Minister Yaung Chih-liang will deliver a five-minute
speech at the 2010 World Health Assembly (WHA) to be held May 17-21 in Geneva,
Switzerland, a Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Thanks to improvements in relations across the Taiwan Strait, China for the
first  time last year did not block  Taiwan's participation as an observer in
the annual WHA -- the decision-making body of the World Health Organization
(WHO) -- and then-DOH Minister Yeh Ching-chuan made history by delivering a
brief speech at that assembly.</P>
      <P>Paul W.L.  Chang,  director  of the MOFA's Department  of International
Organizations, said Yaung will follow the precedent set by Yeh by speaking
briefly at the upcoming WHA to share Taiwan's experiences in operating a
universal health insurance system and offering international medical aid.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Chang went on, Taiwanese delegates will speak at meetings of two
special WHA committees and will also hold bilateral meetings  with their
American,  Japanese  and European  Union counterparts on matters of mutual
concern.</P>
      <P>"We hope WHA attendance will update our understanding of the latest global
developments in health care and medical services while contributing to our bid
for expanded international cooperation, " Chang said.</P>
      <P>After gaining access to the WHA, Chang said, Taiwan is now eyeing meaningful
participation in two U.N.-affiliated organizations -- the United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the International Civil
Aviation Organization (ICAO).</P>
      <P>In the past few months, he continued, Taiwan's embassies and overseas
representative offices have been lobbying support of their host countries for
the ICAO bid.</P>
      <P>Such efforts have borne some fruit, as the European Parliament has already
passed a resolution supporting Taiwan's participation in the ICAO as an
observer, Chang said.</P>
      <P>Heads of state of some of Taiwan's diplomatic allies have also written to the
ICAO secretary-general expressing their support for Taiwan's presence in ICAO
activities, he added.</P>
      <P>In addition,  he went  on,  state  senates  or houses  of representatives in
eight U.S. states have also passed resolutions backing Taiwan's observer status
in the ICAO.</P>
      <P>Also, 85 Czech Republic parliamentarians have sent a joint letter to the ICAO
secretary-general expressing their support for Taiwan's presence, Chang said.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan is a linchpin in East Asian aviation services, Chang said an
average of 1.5 million flights pass through Taiwan's aviation zone annually.</P>
      <P>"Therefore, it is very important for Taiwan to obtain updated flight information
to ensure aviation safety, " he said, adding that Taiwan's participation in the
ICAO would allow the international community to hear Taiwan's opinions on and
visions of improvements in international flight safety.</P>

      <P>Award-winning Japanese violinist Mayuko Kamio will present her first concerto in
Taiwan, at the National Concert Hall in Taipei on May 22, according to an
organizer from the New Aspect Cultural and Educational Foundation Thursday.</P>
      <P>"Kamio is the first musician we are inviting in a series of concerts entitled
'21st Century Rising Stars, '" the organizer indicated.</P>
      <P>The Japanese  violinist  won the Gold Medal  in the 13th International
Tchaikovsky Competition in Moscow in 2007.</P>
      <P>She not only won the prize, but also an invitation from Vladimir Spivakov, a
leading Russian conductor and violinist, to perform the Tchaikovsky Violin
Concerto with the Russian National Orchestra.</P>
      <P>A gifted musician, Kamio began to learn the violin at the age of four, and made
her concerto debut in Tokyo at the age of 10 under the baton of Swiss conductor
Charles Dutoit in a concert broadcast on NHK television.</P>
      <P>Born in 1986, Kamio has won several important competitions, including the
Menuhin International Violin Competition in 1998, the Young Concert Artists
International Auditions in 2000, the Monte Carlo Violin Masters Competition in

same year.</P>
      <P>She has also worked with many famous orchestras, such as the BBC Philharmonic,
the Israel Philharmonic under Zubin Mehta, the Boston Pops and many others.</P>
      <P>In the Taipei concerto, Kamio will use a 1727 Stradivarius violin to present a
repertoire with Schubert's "Fantasy in C major" as the opening. The repertoire
will also include Prokofiev's "Violin Sonata No. 1 in F minor", Ysaye's "Poeme
Elegiaque in D minor" and R. Strauss's " Violin Sonata in E flat major."</P>

      <P>Ben Southall, a British man who beat 34,683 hopefuls last year to get what
Australia's Tourism Queensland described as "the best job in the world," said
when asked if he would have wanted to have his six-month contract extended to a
year that the job "was exhausting."</P>
      <P>"12 months would be a lovely contract, but it's just this chapter of life," the
35-year-old said at a press conference in Taipei during a visit in his new
capacity as an ambassador for Tourism Queensland.</P>
      <P>During his stint as caretaker of Hamilton Island, a resort island on the Great
Barrier Reef, from July to December 2009, Southall published 71 articles
comprising more than 84,000 words, took 1,800 photos and made 52 video diary
entries.</P>
      <P>He also gave interviews to more than 300 media outlets from all over the world.
He earned A$150,000 (US$139,910) for the job.</P>
      <P>Quoting the chief executive of Hamilton Island, Southall said that between
September and November last year, there had been a roughly 74 percent increase
in the number of British tourist visits, and a 236 percent rise in visitor
numbers from China.</P>
      <P>The tourism marketing campaign was launched at "one of the worst times ever"
because of the financial crisis, but the result was successful nevertheless,
Southall noted.</P>
      <P>Asked about his Taiwanese competitor in the final 16 round of job applicants,
Clare Wang, Southall said he is still in touch with her and the other finalists.</P>
      <P>"Clare got the support of the entire country here in Taiwan. She won the wild
card entry. She was the one who got the most votes at the early stages of the
competition when it was down to the top 16, " he said.</P>
      <P>"Everybody does stay in touch," he went on. "Once a month, we all send an e-mail
between all the best job finalists."</P>
      <P>"We all now have 15 other places that we can go to sleep on a sofa," he added to
a laughing audience.</P>
      <P>Southall had visited the United States, Canada, Japan, Denmark, Ireland, the
United Kingdom and China before coming to Taiwan as part of his tourism
ambassador job.</P>
      <P>On his new role, Southall said that "it's really still about making people
jealous around the world -- making people jealous enough to book a flight out to
Queensland."</P>
      <P>"All I am doing is giving presentations, showing the real photos I took and
making people realize that they can do the same thing," he said.</P>

      <P>Robert Horry, an ESPN commentator and retired basketball player who is visiting
Taiwan, predicted Thursday that the 2010 NBA Finals will be a matchup between
the Los Angeles Lakers and Cleveland Cavaliers.</P>
      <P>Horry, who earned the nickname "Big Shot Rob" for his clutch three-point
shooting in playoffs during his 16-year career, also told the media that he
would pick Oklahoma City Thunder young star Kevin Durant as the next great big
shot maker.</P>
      <P>The 208-centimeter forward, who retired in 2008, is one of only two players to
have won NBA championships with three different teams -- two with the Houston
Rockets, three with the Los Angeles Lakers and two with the San Antonio Spurs.</P>
      <P>Horry was invited to Taiwan to endorse the official launch of the NBA's
traditional Chinese character Web site.</P>
      <P>The NBA.com/Taiwan Web site, a collaborative effort by the local sports Web site
Pixnet and the NBA, will be operated by Pixnet starting this month and will
present live Internet streaming of games during the 2010 NBA playoff season from
April to June.</P>
      <P>Doug Creighton, who played for Bank of Taiwan in Taiwan's Super Basketball
League (SBL) , said it will be a great way for Taiwanese basketball fans to
learn more about NBA players.</P>
      <P>Currently, Taiwan cable television channels broadcast three or four NBA games
per week, featuring the more popular teams such as the Lakers, Cavaliers and
Boston Celtics.</P>
      <P>The Hong Kong-based media company TOM Group Limited signed a four-year deal with
the NBA in 2008 for the rights to operate the NBA Web site in China, Taiwan and
Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>However, Taiwanese fans complained that the company merely converted simplified
Chinese text, used in China, into traditional Chinese characters for Taiwanese
audiences, in disregard of the differences in Taiwan and China regarding
basketball terms and the transliteration of player names.</P>
      <P>The NBA playoffs begin Saturday with 16 teams competing in the best-of-seven
first round. The best-of-seven finals will be played in June.</P>
      <P>Asked about the most memorable big shot of his career, Horry said it would have
to be a three-pointer at the buzzer that gave the Lakers a 100V99 win over the
Sacramento Kings in Game 4 of the 2002 Western Conference Finals. The shot tied
the series at 2-2 and the Lakers went on to defeat the Kings in the seven-game
series to take their third straight championship.</P>
      <P>The 39-year-old veteran, who is on his first visit to Taiwan, told the media
that he was very impressed by the local people's knowledge of basketball and
with the Taipei 101 tower, which he said is "like a Transformer every time I
look at it."</P>
      <P>Prompted by reporters, Horry picked his "best starting lineup of today's NBA, "
which included himself, Utah Jazz point guard Deron Williams, Lakers shooting
guard Kobe Bryant, Dallas Mavericks power forward Dirk Nowitzki and Cavaliers
center Shaquille O'Neal.</P>
      <P>Horry jokingly said that as both Bryant and Nowitzki like to shoot, he would
select the veteran O'Neal as center so "I could get some shots."</P>

      <P>A motorcycle show highlighting the latest electrical  models kicked off in
Taipei Thursday  as Taiwan's government is promoting the production and use of
eco-friendly scooters in a country with the highest scooter density in Asia.</P>
      <P>"The Ministry of Economic Affairs allocated NT$1.6 billion (US$51 million) for a
four-year subsidy plan in 2009 to encourage the public to buy electrical
scooters or motorcycles, " said Hsu Chun-fang, deputy director-general of the
ministry's Bureau of Foreign Trade.</P>
      <P>"That is part of the government's goal to promote the use of eco-friendly
products," she told the opening ceremony of the four-day Motorcycle Taiwan show.</P>
      <P>The target of the show is to see sales of 100,000 such scooters or motorcycles
over the next four years, Hsu added.</P>
      <P>Earlier this month, however, leaders of local major business groups urged the
government to raise the target for electrical motorbike sales to one million
over the four-year period.</P>
      <P>They also asked the government to set up lanes especially for electrical
motorbikes and recharging stations for the bikes in cities throughout Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has the highest scooter density in Asia, with every 1.6 person owning a
scooter on average, according to government figures. There are some 14.55
million scooters or motorcycles on the island of 23 million people.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan's  domestic  market  for motorbikes  is reaching maturation, local
companies have begun shifting their focus to overseas markets in the United
States and Europe in recent years, Hsu said at the ceremony.</P>
      <P>The ratio of the country's motorbike exports to total bikes produced rose from
32.94 percent in 1999 to 41.23 percent in 2009, Hsu noted.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's motorbike companies are now facing low-price competition from

      <P>Road damage has taken a heavy toll on travel services in the Alishan area, one
of Taiwan's most iconic tourist destinations, causing the number of visitors to
the mountain resort during this year's spring flower season to drop to a 27-year
low, sources said Thursday.</P>
      <P>According to statistics released by the Alishan Highway Toll Station, only
102,853 people visited the Alishan National Scenic Area between March 15 and
April 15, the lowest number for the period since the inauguration of the Alishan
Highway in 1983.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Forest Bureau designates the month-long period as the Alishan's
flower season to coincide with the blossoming of various species of the many
flowering cherry trees grown there.</P>
      <P>A toll station official said this year's visitor number was even lower than that
recorded in the flower season immediately following the deadly Sept. 21, 1999
earthquake.</P>
      <P>In its 2000 flower season, Alishan still managed to attract 136,000-plus
visitors, the official said.</P>
      <P>"Normally, the number can be expected to exceed 200,000 or even hit 300,000
during the season," said the official.</P>
      <P>He attributed this year's record low number mainly to the suspension of services
of the well-known Alishan alpine railway in the wake of Typhoon Morakot, which
wreaked havoc in the region and several other parts of southern Taiwan last
August.</P>
      <P>Two branch railway lines, including one that leads to Chushan, the traditional
destination for watching the sunrise, have also been closed since the typhoon.</P>
      <P>Worse still, the Alishan Highway, the region's main traffic link, has been
closed to large tour buses since the typhoon. Some sections of the highway are
still being repaired and are only open to small buses and cars.</P>
      <P>Local tour operators said they hope highway and railway repair work can be
completed as soon as possible to give a much-needed shot in the arm to the
region's tourism industry.</P>

      <P>Swiss judicial authorities said Thursday that they expect to hand over the
assets of former President Chen Shui-bian's relatives frozen in Swiss bank
accounts to the Taiwanese authorities as early as possible, but gave no specific
timetable as to when the money would be forthcoming.</P>
      <P>It was the first time the Office of the Attorney General (OAG) of Switzerland
had commented publicly on the ex-first family's case.</P>
      <P>"There is an excellent collaboration between the Taiwanese authorities and the
OAG, " Jeannette Balmer, spokeswoman of the OAG, wrote in a statement to CNA.</P>
      <P>"The objective target of this collaboration is the handover of the assets to the
Taiwanese authorities as early as possible (i.e. practicable)," she went on.</P>
      <P>The Swiss authorities' attitude and their handling of the case are seen as key
in deciding whether Chen will be released on bail.</P>
      <P>On April 2, the High Court gave an ultimatum to Chen's relatives, demanding that
they return the money, and said Chen will have a good chance of being released
on bail if the money is returned and little chance if it is not.</P>
      <P>The former president, indicted on corruption and embezzlement charges, has been
in custody at the Taipei Detention Center in Taipei County since Dec. 30, 2008.
He was given a life sentence and a fine of NT$200 million last September. He is
presently appealing against the sentence and the High Court is expected to hand
down a ruling on it June 11.</P>
      <P>However, it is uncertain whether the Swiss handover of the assets can be
completed by that time.</P>
      <P>Balmer said that measures for such a procedure take time and that no further
information would be given at this stage.</P>
      <P>According to sources familiar with the case, after Taiwan's Special
Investigation Division under the Supreme Prosecutors Office, which is
responsible for the former president's case, sent an agreement signed by Chen's
family to the OAG at the end of March, the Zurich-based RBS Coutts Bank AG and
Merrill Lynch Bank (Suisse) S.A. started account-closing procedures.</P>
      <P>With Chen's current detention period slated to expire April 23, his family are
hopeful that the money held in Switzerland -- roughly NT$700 million (US$21
million) -- can be transferred to a bank account designated by prosecutors,
increasing the chances that Chen can be released on bail.</P>

to serve as a Chinese spy by collecting information related to the government's

December 2008 and February this year.</P>
      <P>Ho also offered Chao US$20,000, liquor and additional pay several times that of

      <P>"The two sides should hold the talks and set up game rules as soon as possible

      <P>The director of the Taipei Office of the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) ,
which represents U.S. interests in the absence of bilateral diplomatic
relations, said Thursday that he is optimistic about Taiwan's economic recovery
and that he welcomes closer economic cooperation between the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>William A. Stanton made the remarks while addressing a party hosted by AmCham-
Kaohsiung in the southern city of Kaohsiung earlier that day.</P>
      <P>A Southern Taiwan White paper, which assesses the business environment in the
region and offers suggestions on the development of industry and education, was
released by AmCham-Kaohsiung at the party.</P>
      <P>AmCham-Kaohsiung President Brian Aiello said the paper was written after visits
to Kaohsiung city and county officials and a survey of 1,737 businesses in the
area.</P>
      <P>On Taiwan's proposed economic cooperation framework agreement with China, Aiello
said that if signed, it will be an important step forward for Taiwan, just as
when the country joined the World Trade Organization (WTO), and will eventually
benefit Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The white paper says the ECFA will allow Taiwan to further consolidate  its
business  base and reduce the trade barriers worldwide,  but suggests that the
country's central and local governments should take good care of the areas and
sectors that will be adversely impacted by the pact.</P>
      <P>Predicting that southern Taiwan will see more focus on the development of green
energy and tourism, the white paper urges the government to speed up the
modernization of airports and seaports in the region, and to improve tourism and
transport facilities.</P>
      <P>Chris Castro, chief of the AIT's Kaohsiung branch, also said in an interview
with CNA that day that the ECFA will also be beneficial for Taiwan-U.S. trade
relations.</P>
      <P>He said AIT will also encourage American architecture firms to seek
participation in many of the important construction projects under way in

      <P>A motorcycle show highlighting the latest electrical  models kicked off in
Taipei Thursday  as Taiwan's government is promoting the production and use of
eco-friendly scooters in a country with the highest scooter density in Asia.</P>
      <P>"The Ministry of Economic Affairs allocated NT$1.6 billion (US$51 million) for a
four-year subsidy plan in 2009 to encourage the public to buy electrical
scooters or motorcycles, " said Hsu Chun-fang, deputy director-general of the
ministry's Bureau of Foreign Trade.</P>
      <P>"That is part of the government's goal to promote the use of eco-friendly
products," she told the opening ceremony of the four-day Motorcycle Taiwan show.</P>
      <P>The target of the show is to see sales of 100,000 such scooters or motorcycles
over the next four years, Hsu added.</P>
      <P>Earlier this month, however, leaders of local major business groups urged the
government to raise the target for electrical motorbike sales to one million
over the four-year period.</P>
      <P>They also asked the government to set up lanes especially for electrical
motorbikes and recharging stations for the bikes in cities throughout Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has the highest scooter density in Asia, with every 1.6 person owning a
scooter on average, according to government figures. There are some 14.55
million scooters or motorcycles on the island of 23 million people.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan's  domestic  market  for motorbikes  is reaching maturation, local
companies have begun shifting their focus to overseas markets in the United
States and Europe in recent years, Hsu said at the ceremony.</P>
      <P>The ratio of the country's motorbike exports to total bikes produced rose from
32.94 percent in 1999 to 41.23 percent in 2009, Hsu noted.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's motorbike companies are now facing low-price competition from
counterparts in China and Southeast Asian countries, but their quality has
helped them play a leading role in the industry, Hsu said.</P>
      <P>Outside the Taiwan International Motorcycle Show, there is a small area to allow

      <P>The latest reversal  of the industrial  innovation  policy highlights a serious
flaw in President Ma Ying-jeou and his staff with regard to financial policy
research and analysis.</P>
      <P>The finance minister and chief budgeter of a country are required to have clear
thinking and a strong professional background, and should not subject themselves
too much to restrictions by the premier and the president.</P>
      <P>However,  our present finance minister  and chief budgeter obviously are more
submissive than professional. Their silence with regard to the industrial
innovation bill reflects their negligence in supervising Taiwan's fiscal
situation.</P>
      <P>Even after a whole year of arbitrary tax cuts in 2009, the Ma administration
has still not realized the seriousness of the country's fiscal deficit and is
now allowing lawmakers to haggle over the corporate income tax rate -- which
could be dropped to 17 percent as a result. The populist, obsequious manner
demonstrated by the administration is very worrisome.</P>
      <P>This serious lack of basic fiscal and financial concepts by our nation's leader

      <P>It was the most malignant and darkest event involving the medical sector in

be working with a fraud ring to claim health insurance reimbursement and payouts
from insurance companies.</P>
      <P>Facing a punitive fine of NT$150 million (US$4.75 million) , one of the
hospitals involved -- Kaohsiung Medical University Chung-Ho Memorial Hospital in
southern Taiwan -- contended that the punishment is too heavy since it was not
the hospital that committed the fraud.</P>
      <P>However, as a medical center, can the hospital actually even say it is not
responsible for the conduct of its medical personnel? There are obviously
glitches in the hospital's management if its director of the Department of

"phony"  patients  undergo chemotherapy treatment, as well as surgery, in order
to claim reimbursement from the National Health Insurance system and insurance

      <P>A 45-year-old woman living in Miaoli County who died two days ago is suspected
of having died from botulism growing on dried bean curd or preserved oysters
that she had eaten, Department of Health (DOH) officials said Friday.</P>
      <P>The woman's 72-year-old mother-in-law, who had also eaten the two suspicious
items, was on intubation in the Taichung Veterans General Hospital intensive
care unit, said Feng Jun-lan, an official with the Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) under the DOH.</P>
      <P>The suspect dried bean curd was bought from a store in their neighborhood in
Miaoli, while the oysters were bought recently in Yunlin, Feng said.</P>
      <P>No symptoms were reported among the other members of the family, including a
grandfather and son, who did not eat the dried bean curd at all, and a grandson
who only consumed a little of the food, according to Feng.</P>
      <P>Lin Ting, deputy director of the DOH's Centers for Disease Control (CDC), said
that although it would take two days to find out the results of tests, their
symptoms suggested serious paralytic illness caused by a nerve toxin produced by
the bacterium clostridium botulinum.</P>
      <P>The CDC has rushed antiviral agents to the hospital in the hope that the 72
-year-old's life can be saved, Lin said.</P>
      <P>Samples of the dried bean curd and salted oyster were also retrieved by the FDA,
but lab reports are not expected to be available for two weeks, Feng said.</P>
      <P>She described the bacteria as anaerobic, gram-positive, spore- forming rods that
produce a potent neurotoxin and grow best in low oxygen conditions.  She
suggested that all home-canned  foods, vegetables and meats should be boiled for
at last 10 minutes before consumption.</P>
      <P>According to DOH tallies, Taiwan's botulism mortality rate averages between 5
percent-10 percent. The illness was declared by the CDC as a notifiable disease
in 2007.</P>
      <P>A total of 12 botulism cases were reported in 2007-2008, with one 67-year-old
man dying of the disease.</P>
      <P>The two Miaoli women were the third and fourth cases this year following a
mother and daughter in Taoyuan County who were diagnosed as victims of botulism
in early April, the CDC said.</P>

      <P>Canada has become the fourth country to sign a working holiday agreement with
Taiwan, allowing young people to travel and work in each other's country, the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) announced at a press conference Friday.</P>
      <P>A Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on youth mobility, which aims to simplify
the administrative process for young people aged 18-35 from Canada and Taiwan
who wish to travel and work in each other's territory for up to one year, was
signed in the Canadian capital of Ottawa earlier in the day by the Canadian
Trade Office in Taipei early Friday, said MOFA spokesman Henry Chen.</P>
      <P>CTOT represents Canadian interests in Taiwan in the absence of bilateral
diplomatic  ties,  while TECO functions as Taiwan's representative office in
Ottawa.</P>
      <P>"Through this arrangement, Canadian and Taiwanese youth can gain a unique
travel, work and life experience abroad, enriching their understanding of each
other's culture, " said CTOT Executive Director Scott Fraser in a press release.
"Such exchanges will also further strengthen the longstanding people-to-people
ties between Canada and Taiwan," he added.</P>
      <P>Taiwan signed similar agreements with Australia and New Zealand in 2004 and with
Japan in 2009. It is the fourth country in the Asia-Pacific region to have made
such arrangements with Canada, following Japan, South Korea and Hong Kong,
according to Chen.</P>
      <P>He said the MOU is expected to come into effect July 1. Each side will offer a
quota of 200 of multiple entry visas in the first year of the program,
increasing the number over the next few years depending on the popularity of the
program.</P>
      <P>The program is expected to boost bilateral tourism. According to statistics
provided by Taiwan's Tourism Bureau, the number of Taiwanese nationals traveling
to Canada plummeted from 112,413 in 2004 to 61,893 in 2009.</P>
      <P>The existing working holiday programs are going smoothly, Chen went on, with
more than 12,000 applicants -- 600 for New Zealand, 2,000 to Japan and more than
10,000 to Australia -- last year.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  Winston Chen, deputy director-general of MOFA's Department of North
American Affairs, said the ministry has been working hard toward Canada's
granting of visa-free privileges for Taiwanese nationals and will continue to do
so.</P>
      <P>In terms of Taiwan's potential filing of a complaint with the World Trade
Organization (WTO) against Canada over its refusal to allow generalized
preferential  tariffs on Taiwan-made  textile products, he said this will not
have a negative impact on the visa negotiations.</P>
      <P>"Bilateral relations between Taiwan and Canada are on the right track and are
too good to be damaged by a trade dispute, " he said, adding that Taiwan will
still do its best to protect its own interests once the case is in the WTO.</P>

      <P>The phenomenon of "one Taiwan, two worlds" is typical of the increasingly uneven
distribution of wealth in this country. Unless the vanishing middle class is
rejuvenated, this phenomenon of wealth polarization will place Taiwan in a
precarious situation.</P>
      <P>On the part of the government, providing assistance to the financially
disadvantaged will be of greatest help to producing a "multiplier effect."</P>
      <P>We are not advocating "robbing the rich to give to the poor" to provide social
equality. However, we understand that it is the wage and salary earners rather
than those high net worth individuals on the tip of the social pyramid that
contribute the largest share of the country's tax revenue. The government should
launch extensive reforms and impose a tax on personal property.</P>
      <P>As for the business sector, it should fulfill its social responsibility and
spend more on public interest efforts than ostentatious,  impractical  items.
Furthermore,  "employees are corporate assets" should not be a mere slogan but
should be put into practice.</P>
      <P>The middle class will only thrive in a society where businesses view their
employees as assets and provide their workers with reasonable pay and due
respect. Without a steady and strong middle class, the wealth disparity in
society will continue to widen, which will in turn intensify labor-capital
conflicts.</P>
      <P>The phenomenon should be taken seriously by the nation. In particular, the
country's two major political parties should get election considerations out of
their brains and stop passing laws that could further widen the divide between
the poor and the rich.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>With foreign money flowing into Asian currency markets in anticipation of the
Chinese yuan appreciation, the New Taiwan dollar has been rising against the
U.S. greenback in recent days.</P>
      <P>The local unit climbed NT$0.121, or 0.38 percent, to reach NT$31.339 at one
point in Thursday's trading session, but edged down as of the 4 p.m. close
following central bank intervention.</P>
      <P>According to a Goldman Sachs assessment, the NT dollar was undervalued by about
20 percent.</P>
      <P>Judging from Thursday's currency market development, banking sources said, the
central bank would not want the NT dollar to appreciate too fast, although the
general trend is for the local currency to continue to strengthen, they added.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from local media coverage of the issue: Commercial
Times:</P>
      <P>The NT dollar will continue to rise at a moderate pace after it surged past the
NT$31.5 level.</P>
      <P>According to a Goldman Sachs report, the local currency is undervalued by at
least 20 percent and it forecast that the NT dollar might rise to NT$30 against
the greenback over the next 12 months.</P>
      <P>Sakthi Siva, Credit Suisse's Asia-Pacific and emerging markets equity
strategist, said that even though Asian currencies have appreciated
significantly recently, most of them have not yet returned to the levels
recorded before the 2008-2009 global financial crisis. Therefore, he predicted
that their upward streaks will not end any time soon.</P>
      <P>Credit Suisse also forecast that the currencies of South Korea, Brazil,  Taiwan,
Israel  and China will have great room for appreciation this year. It gave an
even more optimistic forecast than Goldman Sachs, saying that the NT dollar has
the potential to rise to NT$29.5 against the greenback by the end of this year.
(April 16, 2010). China Times:</P>
      <P>Liu Kuo-chao, head of the Importers and Exporters Association of Taipei, said
the continued rise in the local currency's value has affected local
manufacturers' competitiveness.</P>
      <P>He said that if the NT dollar rises to 30 to the US dollar, many local exporters
will face enormous pressure. As a lot of hot money is flowing to Asia, central
banks in most Asian countries, including Singapore and South Korea, have been
forced to let their currencies to rise.</P>
      <P>In the face of this trend, Liu said he cannot expect Taiwan's central bank to do
otherwise. "We can only hope that our central bank will do its utmost to have
our currency rise at a moderate pace," Liu said.</P>
      <P>Market analysts shared Liu's view that the local currency cannot buck the
general market trend and will appreciate steadily. But they said whether the NT
dollar will rise to 31 will hinge on the international currency market trend.

    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice Premier Eric Liluan Chu's willingness to run for the Kuomintang (KMT) in
Xinbei City is a shot in the arm for the ruling party in the mayoral elections
for the five special municipalities, KMT Secretary-General King Pu-tsung said
Friday.</P>
      <P>The bid for Xinbei City -- to be upgraded from Taipei County -- marks a
challenge in Chu's political career but is a crucial and positive move for the
KMT, King said in an interview broadcast Friday on local television channel TTV.</P>
      <P>Chu's announcement of the bid has calmed the party's edginess concerning the
election in Xinbei, a major battlefield for the KMT and the opposition
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), King said.</P>
      <P>On the prospects of incumbent KMT Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin's taking on strong
DPP rival Su Tseng-chang, King said it would be a formidable task for Hau, but
added that the mayor is well-prepared and in high spirits.</P>
      <P>On the election in Kaohsiung City, which will be a merger of the southern port
city and Kaohsiung County, King said it would be a "decisive battle" that could
see a complete reversal for the ruling party in that crucial area.</P>
      <P>King said that six KMT members have made known their intentions to vie for the
Kaohsiung nomination.</P>
      <P>"The final nominee will be selected on principles of openness, fairness and
justice," the secretary-general said.</P>
      <P>Turning to his relationship with President Ma Ying-jeou, who doubles as KMT
chairman, King described it as a "relationship of trust."</P>
      <P>King said he will endeavor to do his best for the president and the country
while working as a top aide to Ma.</P>
      <P>On criticism that Ma was too weak as a president, King said that Ma is a mild
man who upholds democratic rationality and makes decisions based on democratic
consensus.</P>
      <P>He added that a democratic nation should avoid "politics of hate," referring to
criticism of President Ma by DPP members.</P>
      <P>According to King, the DPP distorted the president's hard-earned achievements in
improving the cross-Taiwan Strait relations -- lauded by the international
community -- as a plot to "sell out Taiwan" borne of Taiwan-centric ideology.</P>
      <P>On Ma's low approval ratings, King appealed to the country to give the president
"a little more time" for the results of his administrative efforts to show.</P>

      <P>The planned fund will exist in the form of a private equity fund that will
target all cross-Taiwan Strait industrial businesses without limitation on the
category of industrial sectors, Kung noted.</P>
      <P>Fubon is regarded as a Taiwanese financial holding company with a comprehensive
business deployment in China. Apart from the planned investment fund, it is also
working to form a fund management company with the Zhejiang Province-based
Founder Securities, according to the company.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, FHC Chairman Daniel M. Tsai expressed hope for the financial services
sector to be included in the first list of goods and services subject to
immediate tariff concessions or exemptions under the "early harvest"  program
of the proposed  economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) between Taiwan
and China.</P>
      <P>The early harvest lists are seen as the backbone of the trade pact Taiwan hopes
to be sealed as early as June.</P>
      <P>The financial sector was not placed on the agenda of the second round of ECFA
talks held March 31-April 1. The arrangement drew concern from Taiwanese
investors in China who have been calling for the two sides of the strait to open
their doors to the banking sectors of each side.</P>
      <P>While urging the government to proceed with the ECFA talks at a faster pace,
Tsai also called for the authorities in charge of financial affairs to relax
restrictions that restrain Taiwan's banking operators from investing in China.</P>

      <P>From May 17, United Kingdom passport applications for British nationals will no
longer be handled by the British Trade and Cultural Office (BTCO) and will need
to be sent directly by the applicant to a regional passport processing center in
Hong Kong, the UK's representative office in Taiwan announced Friday in a press
release.</P>
      <P>The office will no longer accept passport applications from British nationals,
said the BTCO, Britain's official authority in Taiwan in the absence of
bilateral diplomatic ties.</P>
      <P>Previously, the BTCO acted as a middleman for British passport applications in
Taipei, accepting the applications, sending them to the issuing authorities in
Hong Kong, and then issuing the passport to the applicant.</P>
      <P>According to the BTCO, the changes are part of a global initiative to streamline
the issuance of passports overseas.</P>
      <P>The Passport Processing Center in Hong Kong, which will produce and return
passports directly to applicants in Taiwan, aims to issue all new passports
within 10 working days, the office said.</P>
      <P>If British nationals need to travel urgently, however, the BTCO will still be

can be designated as a world cultural heritage item by the United Nations.</P>
      <P>Ma also instructed government agencies to use traditional, also known as
standard, Chinese characters, instead of the simplified form of characters used
in China, when receiving visitors from there, so as to promote the use of the
traditional writing form.</P>
      <P>The president made the remarks when addressing the opening of a cross-Taiwan
Strait conference on Chinese literature held in Taipei. Other participants
included National Cultural Association (NCA) President Liu Chao-shiuan, the 2000
Nobel laureate in literature Gao Xingjian, poet Ya Hsien, and writers Lee Ou-fan
and Liu Zaifu.</P>
      <P>According to Liu Chao-shiuan, literature could be the only available resolution
to cross-strait differences because the two sides share a common cultural and
historical memory.</P>
      <P>In light of the situation in which there are terms that carry different meanings
in China and Taiwan, the NCA is seeking to compile a database of Chinese terms
in cooperation with China to expedite cross-strait cultural exchanges, he said.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the issue, Gao, however, said it is not necessary to standardize

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taoyuan County Public Health Bureau on Friday ordered two dried bean curd
makers to suspend operations for two weeks after two women were reportedly
poisoned by food that may have come from the two companies.</P>
      <P>The bureau notified Cheng Hsiang Foods Co. and Richang Bean Curd Plant in the
northern Taiwan county to temporarily suspend business after their products were
found in the refrigerator of the two women's home in Miaoli County.</P>
      <P>Of the two, the 45-year-old daughter-in-law died two days ago. Doctors suspect
she contracted botulism from either dried bean curd or preserved oysters she had
eaten, the Cabinet-level Department of Health (DOH) said earlier that day.</P>
      <P>The woman's 72-year-old mother-in-law, who had also eaten the two food items,
was on intubation in Taichung Veterans General Hospital's intensive care unit,
according to Feng Jun-lan, an official with the Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) under the DOH.</P>
      <P>Lin Ting, deputy director of the DOH's Centers for Disease Control (CDC) , said
that although it would be two days before test results are available,  the
women's symptoms suggested serious paralytic illness caused by a nerve toxin
produced by the bacterium clostridium botulinum, which causes botulism.</P>
      <P>The CDC had rushed several doses of botulismus-antitoxin to the hospital in a
bid to save the 72-year-old's life, Lin said.</P>
      <P>The Taoyuan health officials have also notified major grocery chain stores in
the county to pull products from the two companies off shelves.</P>
      <P>The companies' owners, however, complained of mistreatment. They said their
products were safe and produced in line with government standards.</P>
      <P>They complained that the two-week suspension will cost them hundreds of
thousands of New Taiwan dollars.</P>
      <P>"I hope the relevant tests will be completed soon so that my company's name can
be cleared, " said Tseng Fan-Hsiang, owner of Cheng Hsiang Foods Co.</P>
      <P>In related news, Lin said around noon that the CDC's inventory of botulismus-
antitoxin doses now totals only around 15 after 10 were sent to National Taiwan
University Hospital and Taichung Veterans General Hospital.</P>
      <P>"We have already placed new orders for the medicine to beef up our supplies,"
Lin said.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, the antitoxin costs NT$149,000 per dose of 250cc and is
distributed to botulism patients free of charge because the illness was declared
by the CDC as a notifiable disease in 2007.</P>
      <P>Samples of the dried bean curd and salted oysters that the two women consumed
were also retrieved by the FDA, but lab reports are not expected to be available
for two weeks.</P>
      <P>The two Miaoli women were the third and fourth cases this year following a
mother and daughter in Taoyuan County who were diagnosed with botulism in early
April, the CDC said. The Taoyuan mother and daughter have been treated with
botulismus-antitoxin.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Interns get low job ratings but remain in demand by employers: poll</HEADLINE>

      <P>Domestic enterprises expressed widespread dissatisfaction with the performance
of interns hired under a special government subsidy program, but more than 90
percent said they were willing to keep at least some of the interns on for a
second year, a poll conducted by the 1111 job bank has found.</P>
      <P>In a survey of 458 companies conducted by the job bank between March 31 and
April 13, the respondents gave the interns an average score of 41 on a scale of
100 for their job performance, with 34.62 percent of respondents giving their
interns scores between 21 and 40.</P>
      <P>The main causes of dissatisfaction were the interns' attitude toward their jobs
and early termination of their contracts, according to the survey, the results
of which were released Friday.</P>
      <P>At the same time, however, 92 percent of the companies said they were willing to
keep the interns on after their one-year contracts expired, and 52.32 percent
were willing to offer them formal positions.</P>
      <P>A spokeswoman for 1111 Job Bank explained that the apparent contradiction
between the high disapproval rate and the high willingness to retain the interns
was related to two factors.</P>
      <P>Companies involved in the program hired five interns on average, so even if they
were willing to rehire only some of their interns, they would have been included
among the 92 percent willing to retain the interns.</P>
      <P>Also, because many companies had already invested in training and familiarizing
the interns with their operations, the employers were more willing to rehire the
experienced interns than new recruits, the spokeswoman said.</P>
      <P>Under the internship program launched in mid-2009 to curb unemployment among
young adults, the government provides subsidies to businesses that offer one-
year internships  to individuals who graduated from a university or college
within the previous three years.</P>
      <P>Businesses receive NT$26,000 per month for each new graduate hired (including
subsidies for health and labor insurance) , and the interns are paid NT$22,000
per month.</P>
      <P>Open to 34,000 people, the program is still employing 29,265 interns. Most of
the jobs are related to planning and design, marketing and trade, and business
management, according to the survey.</P>
      <P>Up to 68.75 percent of the companies responding to the poll have raised their
interns' salaries, with an average monthly salary of NT$23,651 paid to each
intern, the survey found.</P>
      <P>Just over half, or 57 percent, of the companies said that if they rehired the
interns, they would raise their salaries by an average of NT$1,280, while 13
percent said they had already raised their salaries, and 30 percent said they
would maintain the salary level at NT$22,000.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 64 percent of respondents expressed the belief that the program would
help address unemployment among new university graduates, who faced a
particularly difficult job market after graduating in 2009 because of the global
economic downturn.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Chung-Hua Institution for Economic Research (CIER) on Friday revised its
forecast for Taiwan's GDP growth in 2010 upwards to 4.99 percent, 0.33
percentage points higher than its previous projection made last December.</P>
      <P>Wang Lee-rong, director of the CIER's Center for Economic Forecasting,
attributed the revision to growing private-sector investment and increased
exports amid a recovering economy.</P>
      <P>She warned, however, that if the government decides to wind down the economic
stimulus measures it has used to combat the global economic slump or lower
public investment to curb its budget deficit, Taiwan's growth rate could fall to
4.08 percent in 2010.</P>
      <P>The economic research body also forecast that Taiwan's GDP should grow 6.55
percent in the second quarter of the year, 4.01 percent in Q3, and 1.08 in Q4,
while unemployment for the year should average 5.5 percent.</P>
      <P>Weaker growth experienced in Q4 could continue into 2011, Wang said, with the
CIER revising its growth forecast for next year downwards to 4.09 percent from
4.30 percent.</P>
      <P>Wang said inflationary pressures should be moderate in 2010, with consumer
prices expected to rise 1.71 percent and wholesale prices projected to increase
by 5.76 percent.</P>
      <P>She stressed, however, that the CIER's projections were on the conservative side
and had not taken into account the impact of a planned economic cooperation
framework agreement (ECFA) with China and a possible appreciation of the Chinese
yuan.</P>
      <P>Wang predicted that the yuan will gain in value in June when the G20 holds a
summit of finance ministers and central bankers, and she expected that if
China's currency become stronger, the Taiwan dollar would also appreciate.</P>
      <P>She did not believe, though, that the yuan would appreciate too rapidly in a
short period of time.</P>
      <P>The CIER forecast that the Taiwan dollar will average 31.299 against the
greenback in 2010 and that it will continue rising in 2011.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Wang warned that the government's finances would worsen if an
industrial innovation bill, which slashes the corporate income tax rate to 17
percent (from the current 20 percent) , passes the Legislative Yuan, an outcome
that could affect public investment in the future.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Friday that it is the right time to sign a proposed
economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) with China and that the
government will do what it can to prevent disadvantaged industries from being
affected by the pact.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks in response to a call by several precision machinery
companies in Taichung City to sign the proposed ECFA as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Victor Taichung Machinery Works Co. President Huang Ming-ho said that Taiwan's
machinery exports to China face strong competition from South Korea now and that
the competition will become even stiffer if China signs a free trade agreement
with South Korea allowing South Korean exports to China to enjoy lower tariffs.</P>
      <P>The signing of the proposed ECFA might pose a risk to Taiwan, but it could also
be an opportunity for the country, Huang said, adding that if Taiwan does not
sign the cross-Taiwan Strait trade pact, the machinery sector could be left with
nowhere to go.</P>
      <P>But if an ECFA is signed, there would be room for the industry to develop and
create a peak period of about 5 to 10 years, or even more than 20 years,
according to Huang.</P>
      <P>Echoing Huang, Ma said the machinery sector is a major source of Taiwan's soft
power, and that if the ECFA is not signed, the competitiveness of Taiwan's
machinery industry would lag behind its Japanese and South Korean rivals in the
Chinese market.</P>
      <P>Ma cited experts as saying that due to the global economic recovery, it is the
right time to sign the pact and it could help stimulate the revival of domestic
industries.</P>
      <P>The president said that in the initial stage, the scope of products and services
on an early harvest list for immediate concessions under the trade accord will
be small, but include the necessary items.</P>
      <P>To mitigate potential negative impact the accord could bring to vulnerable local
industries, the government will provide funds to help affected sectors, he said.</P>

      <P>Israeli conductor Amos Talmon will present music from Israel's past and present
when he makes his debut in Taipei this weekend.</P>
      <P>In the concert, called "Voice of Israel -- Now and Then, " Talmon will
collaborate with local cellist Ku Mei-yu to present Max Bruch's "Kol Nidrei" and
conduct the Moment Musical Youth Orchestra in performances of Jewish composer
Marc Lavri's "Emek" and Tchaikovsky's Symphony No. 6 in B minor, "Pathetique."</P>
      <P>"Lavri's symphonic poem 'Emek' depicts Israel's landscape and spirit through
music. The other piece by Max Bruch, 'Kol Nidrei, ' is the most Jewish piece I
can think of, " said Talmon Friday.</P>
      <P>Invited to Taipei by Chiang Ching-po, the music director of the Philharmonia
Moment Musical, Talmon is excited about his first appearance in Taiwan's
capital, and he hopes to promote communication between young musicians in the
two countries in the future.</P>
      <P>Chiang and Talmon are both committed to promoting talented young musicians, so
after they met in Israel, where Chiang was invited to conduct the Israel
Symphony Orchestra Rishon LeZion last Christmas, they became good friends, and
Chiang invited Talmon to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"It's a good start for our future cooperation to introduce talented young
musicians to come to Taipei or to go to Israel to present their music," Chiang
said.</P>
      <P>The 47-year-old Talmon is regarded as unique among conductors internationally
because of the unusual path he's taken to making a name for himself in his
profession.</P>
      <P>He had been a businessman for much of his young adult life but could not shake
an interest in music that had been with him since childhood.</P>
      <P>"So I decided to take action on music 13 years ago, and now when I look back, I
feel great about my choice," he said.</P>
      <P>Talmon launched his career by conducting orchestras in his home country, such as
the Israel Philharmonic, Israel Symphony Rishon LeZion and Jerusalem Radio
Symphony.</P>
      <P>As he gained fame, he later collaborated with famous orchestras outside of the
country, including the Polish Radio Symphony Warsaw, Zurich Symphony Orchestra,
Beijing Symphony, and the Mexico State Symphony.</P>
      <P>He also founded the Music Angels Herzliya Foundation in 2000 and was also the
music director of the Grand Symphonic Series, produced by the Music Angels

      <P>The high court panel took charge of Chen's case on Sept. 24, 2009, after he
appealed his life sentence.</P>
      <P>Both Chen and his wife were sentenced to life in prison on Sept. 11, 2009 by the
Taipei District Court and fined NT$200 million (US$6.13 million) and NT$300
million, respectively, on counts of corruption, embezzlement and taking bribes.</P>

      <P>The Taipei-based Eden Social Welfare Foundation launched a campaign Friday to
help children from an orphanage school in China's Qinghai province after the
school was destroyed in a 7.1 magnitude earthquake April 14.</P>
      <P>The foundation announced that it will first donate NT$1 million (US$31,800) to
the school in Qinghai's Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture of Yushu before sending
volunteers from Taiwan in May to help with relief work.</P>
      <P>At a news conference Friday, Eden called Nyima Renzin, the principal of the
school,  to ask about the aftermath of the earthquake. The principal cried as he
said that the school's 220 orphans and more than 10 teachers have been forced to
camp at a horse-racing course since the quake destroyed the school, killing one
teacher and injuring six students.</P>
      <P>"They need winter clothes very much now to keep them warm," Nyima Renzin said,
noting that the temperature dropped to low as to minus 4 or 5 degrees Celsius at
night.</P>
      <P>Eden Chief Executive Huang Cho-sung said it is difficult to enter Yushu at the
moment because the Chinese government has blocked roads leading to quake-hit
areas. Moreover, sandstorms had reportedly caused trouble for road traffic
between Xining, the capital of Qinghai province, and Yushu, he added.</P>
      <P>Volunteers from Eden currently posted in Sichuan province were expected to
arrive in Qinghai Friday, where they will work along with Handicap International
to provide aid, Huang said.</P>
      <P>The earthquake left 760 people dead, according to China's state-run Xinhua News
Agency.</P>
      <P>Since 2004, the Eden foundation has sent volunteers annually to remote,
impoverished areas in foreign countries including the Philippines, Thailand,
India and China to help less-privileged children and families.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwanese scientist makes breakthrough in biotracer research</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 16 (CNA)
04/16/10  21:10:57

    <TEXT>
      <P>A Taiwan-trained biomedical engineer has gained international renown with a
breakthrough in creating a new generation of biotracer, the National Science
Council (NSC) said Friday.</P>
      <P>Lin Cheng-an, an assistant professor in Chung Yuan Christian University's
Department of Biomedical Engineering, received the 2010 Young Investigator Award
from the International Society for Optical Engineering (SPIE)  in January for
his achievements  in using nanotechnology in developing new materials for
biotracer production, the council said.</P>
      <P>His paper, which described a novel method of synthesizing fluorescent gold
nanoclusters for molecular imaging inside the human body, was carried in the
2009 ACS Nano, a peer-reviewed scientific journal published by the American
Chemical Society.</P>
      <P>It ranked third in terms of the click through rate among the journal's
nanotechnology-related papers in 2009.</P>
      <P>The paper even attracted the attention of "Nature, " one of the world's most
prestigious science journals,  which published an interview with him in its
March 25 issue.</P>
      <P>"It marked the first time that the world's top science journal has carried an
exclusive interview with a young Taiwanese scientist," NSC Deputy Minister Chen
Cheng-hong said at a news conference. "It is an honor for our academic sector."</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, Lin said biotracers are an important tool to
track and mark cells in biomedical research. At present, quantum dots are the
preferred material for cellular imaging because of their stability and
brightness relative to organic dyes.</P>
      <P>But they still have major drawbacks. They cannot be used in humans because they
contain toxic ions, such as cadmium.</P>
      <P>In comparison, Lin said, the biotracer he developed using fluorescent gold
nanoclusters are more suitable for molecular imaging inside the human body
because nanoparticles are smaller, and gold is a bioinert and biocompatible
material.</P>
      <P>"It will allow us to track cells -- for example, an antibody that is a marker
for cancer -- over a long period of time, " Lin said, adding that the material
can be used in biophotonics, biomedicine and molecular biotechnology.</P>
      <P>Lin acknowledged that his new material still needs to undergo more biosafety and
biocompatibility, and other issues, such as how to flush it out of one's system,
also need to be resolved before it can be used in humans on a clinical basis.</P>
      <P>Lin said that at present, he is collaborating with Yeh Hung-yi, a cardiologist
at Mackay Memorial Hospital in Taipei, to use the nano-biotracer to mark stem
cells taken from the human body and inject them into the deformed rear limbs in
mice to help them recover.</P>
      <P>The 33-year-old is a locally trained scientist who obtained his bachelor,
master's and doctoral degrees in biomedical engineering from Chun Yuan Christian
University.</P>
      <P>In his interview with Nature, Lin said he originally studied the biological
effects of ultrasound stimulation. Under his mentor Walter Chang's
encouragement,  he decided  to focus his efforts  on nanobiotechnology in 2002
when the NSC began promoting a national nanotechnology program.</P>
      <P>He received a scholarship co-sponsored by the NSC and Germany's DAAD (Deutscher
Akademischer Austausch Dienst) to do post-doctor research on nanobiophotonics.</P>
      <P>The research project allowed him to receive tutoring from both Taiwan and German
collaborators, which Lin said gave him plenty of inspiration.</P>
      <P>"Nanobiophotonics -- generating photons to image or manipulate biological
materials at the nanoscale -- was quite new in Taiwan at that time, " Lin
recalled in the interview, adding that he and his mentor's initial efforts to
synthesize fluorescent nanocrystals failed.</P>
      <P>"Collaborators in Germany helped us gain the necessary skills, " Lin said.</P>
      <P>In 2005, Lin said, Professor Chang arranged for him to visit Wolfgang Parak's
group, then at Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, for two months to learn
the skills needed to synthesize quantum dots.</P>
      <P>On his future career plans, Lin said he hoped to develop some promising nano-
related products, especially for clinical use, and patent them.</P>
      <P>"Once they are on the market, the benefit of the technology transfer will come
back to our university for research and education efforts," he added. CNA Photo

    <HEADLINE>National Academy of Civil Service opens with president's blessing</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou gave his full support Friday to proposed amendments to
the country's civil service performance evaluation system, saying it's time for
the existing system to be modified to upgrade the quality of the country's civil
service.</P>
      <P>"The purpose of the Civil Service Performance Evaluation Act is to encourage
civil servants rather than punish them, " Ma said at the inauguration ceremony
of the National Academy of Civil Service.</P>
      <P>"Therefore, we should place our focus on whether the proposed reform can realize
the goal of rewarding outstanding civil servants while retiring underperforming
ones."</P>
      <P>It was the first time that Ma has publicly thrown his weight behind the
controversial Examination Yuan-initiatied amendments to the civil service
evaluation act.</P>
      <P>The amendments  have sparked a backlash among some public functionaries because
they would require all government agencies to give at least 3 percent of their
staffers a "C" grade in their annual evaluations.</P>
      <P>The draft package, which also proposes that civil servants be retired or fired
if they get three "Cs" over 10 years, is now pending legislative approval.</P>
      <P>Ma said critics need not focus their concern on the "3 percent C-grade" proposal
and should instead determine whether the new system can effectively boost the
morale of civil servants and upgrade service quality.</P>
      <P>The president  said the package's  inclusion  of objective evaluation standards
and a mechanism for underperforming civil servants to offset poor evaluations,
as well as guidelines to establish an efficient and independent channel of
appeal, are very important to reforming the system.</P>
      <P>He therefore hoped the reform package could clear the Legislature in the not-
too-distant future.</P>
      <P>He also lauded Examination Yuan President John Kuan for his broad-mindedness and
modesty shown in the process of formulating the reform package.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, Kuan said the National Academy of Civil Service
is an upgrade of the Examination Yuan's original body responsible for civil
service training.</P>
      <P>The new academy is expected to play a greater role in training and cultivating
competent  civil servants in order to better contribute to good governance, Kuan
said.</P>
      <P>"Reform of the civil service evaluation system and reinforcement of manpower
training are like two wings to help uplift our civil service quality," he added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan approved the draft Statute to Encourage Industrial
Innovation Friday night, after a marathon debate between legislators of the
ruling Kuomintang (KMT) and the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>The  Legislative  Yuan  began  showdown  votes  on various controversial clauses
of the draft bill Friday afternoon, with dozens of legislators offering
arguments for and against.</P>
      <P>The caucuses of the KMT and the DPP agreed in the morning that the screening of
the draft bill had to be finalized during Friday's session.</P>
      <P>At a consultation initiated by Legislative Speaker Wang Jin-pyng, the two
caucuses agreed to set aside 17 controversial clauses and concluded the second
reading of the draft bill in the morning.</P>
      <P>The deadlocked clauses mainly concerned tax incentives and non-project related
subsidies to business and industry for innovation that the DPP caucus has said
will only benefit big businesses. Most of the DPP arguments failed to be adopted
as the bill was undergoing its final review, or third reading.</P>
      <P>A KMT version of the draft bill was approved by the Cabinet in May 2009 as a
means to stimulate industrial innovation and research and development, since a
previous investment-stimulating measure -- the Statute for Upgrading Industry --
was to expire at the end of 2009.</P>
      <P>During the last legislative session, however, the proposal met strong resistance
from the DPP, which said that several of the draft's provisions overlooked the
requirements  of small-  and medium-sized industries.</P>
      <P>Although the ruling KMT controlled a majority of the legislative seats, the
draft bill failed to pass the legislature before the Statute for Industrial
Upgrading expired.</P>
      <P>The hotly debated business income tax rate is not included in the draft bill,
despite the fact the tax break is meant to be a major incentive measure to
encourage research and development.</P>
      <P>A closely related draft bill on business taxes will be screened by legislators
next week after the KMT caucus submits a proposal to cut the business income tax
rate from 20 percent to 17 percent. A DPP proposal to reduce the business income
tax rate from 20 percent to 17.5 percent already passed the second reading at
the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Since tax incentives remain at the core of the innovative incentive bill, a bill
on tax breaks is required for tax authorities to make necessary adjustments to
the taxation system.</P>

      <P>A local financial holding company called on the government Friday to lift a ban
on Chinese banks from holding stakes in Taiwan's banks and financial holding
companies, saying local banks would not necessarily be at a disadvantage at the
negotiating table.</P>
      <P>Victor Kung, president of Fubon Financial Holding Co., Taiwan's second largest
listed financial services company, said the attempts by some Taiwanese banks to
sell stakes to Chinese banks has raised concerns that an major influx of funds
from China could undermine Taiwan's banking system.</P>
      <P>Kung dismissed the concerns, however, arguing that if local banks can sell their
stakes at 3-5 times their value, they could be the winners in the transactions.</P>
      <P>Noting that the banking and financial sector in Taiwan now operates in an
extremely competitive environment, Kung said that if Chinese investors took over
Taiwanese banks, he doubted whether they could survive the market.</P>
      <P>Also, Chinese authorities would also not necessarily be willing to allow their
banks to invest in Taiwan, the Fubon Financial executive said, adding that with
China's banks enjoying an interest rate spread of at least 3 percent, Taiwan's
financial sector might not be very attractive to them to begin with.</P>
      <P>Kung said, however, that Chinese banks are welcome to take a stake in Fubon and
that the company is keen to forge strategic alliances with Chinese partners.</P>
      <P>But he indicated that if their offers are not attractive enough, Fubon is not
likely to be interested in working with them.</P>
      <P>Fubon Financial was Taiwan's first financial services company to buy a stake in
a Chinese bank, when it bought a 19.99 percent share in Xiamen City Commercial
Bank through Fubon Bank (Hong Kong) in 2008.</P>
      <P>It now plans to launch insurance and fund-management ventures in China in the
hope of building a business conglomerate in Fujian Province on a scale similar

      <P>National Defense Minister Kao Hua-chu gave his word Friday that an ammunition
depot located in an aboriginal community in Taitung County will be removed in
three to five years, after residents voiced their opposition to having the depot
so close to them.</P>
      <P>Kao made the promise during a visit to Hsinwu community in the eastern county's
Haiduan Township to listen to the voice of the Bunun people who live there. He
was there at the invitation of Legislator Kung Wen-chi of the ruling Kuomintang.</P>
      <P>In 1972, the MND chose the mountainous community, which is about 70 kilometers
from downtown Taitung City, as the site for an ammunition depot where the guns
and cannons for the Army and the Air Force in the Taitung area could be
stockpiled.</P>
      <P>With the ammunition depot near their homes, the residents have lived "in
constant fear, " Kung said. They also believe it hampers the tourism development
of the community, which is part of the Southern Cross-Island Highway linking
Kaohsiung and Tainan counties in the west to Taitung County in the east.</P>
      <P>For Haiduan Township's years of accommodating the depot, the Ministry of
National Defense said it would reciprocate by providing NT$2 million annually to
the community starting in 2011, as long as the depot remained in the area.</P>
      <P>It stipulated, however, that 90 percent of the funds were to be used on local
development, which residents of the area claimed would not be in line with local
needs.</P>
      <P>They hoped the funds could be allocated to other areas, such as culture and
health insurance,  or as subsidies for low-income households.</P>
      <P>But even with the promise of money, community residents agreed it was best "if

      <P>Young children are highly susceptible to influenza A (H1N1) if any family member
is infected with the virus, a pediatrician at National Taiwan University (NTU)
Hospital said Friday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the annual conference of the Asian Society for Pediatric Research
(ASPR) , Chang Luan-ying said the average H1N1 infection rate within households
was 27 percent, but the ratio reached an average of 61 percent among children.</P>
      <P>Chang said her report was based on the findings of a study on 87 local families
with a total of 310 members.</P>
      <P>Citing the findings, Chang said that if an H1N1 patient was living with four
family members, one was likely to come down with the virus.</P>
      <P>While the within-family infection rate was 15 percent among adults, the
percentage for children was more than four times that figure, Chang said.</P>
      <P>"Children were not only more vulnerable to H1N1 infection than adults but also
more susceptible to complications, " said Chang, who argued that children,
particularly pre-schoolers, should be put on the priority list for immunization.</P>
      <P>According to Chang, NTU Hospital's pediatrics department accepted 61 patients
with severe H1N1 symptoms who needed hospitalization and 47 of them were
discharged after recovery. The remaining 14 had to stay at intensive care wards
or died.</P>
      <P>"Our statistics show that 21 percent of H1N1 child patients needed to be
hospitalized and their average mortality rate was about 5 percent," she added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Wavering policies and disrespect for professionalism by the administration of
President Ma Ying-jeou, as demonstrated in its dealing with the industrial
innovation bill, will alienate and hollow out his economic and finance talent
pool.</P>
      <P>When the bill was being discussed by the Cabinet's Tax Reform Committee last
October, the committee members agreed on a version that would lower the
corporate income tax rate to 20 percent and keep four types of tax breaks.
However, after the bill reached the Legislative Yuan, this version was discarded
amid noise by lawmakers and business representatives.</P>
      <P>Of all the finance and economic officials in the Cabinet, there are probably
none who would brace up and defend their own policies. These officials lack any
core ideas and policy directions and comply with whatever instructions come from
above. This is where the Ma administration's crisis lies.</P>
      <P>The president's financial and economic advisory council is also to blame for
Taiwan's present financial and economic problems, because there are serious
flaws in both its composition  and operation.</P>
      <P>Around one-third of the members in the council are linked to the business
sector, with the result that almost all economic and financial policies lean
toward the sector. In meetings, the members often come to conclusions after only
brief discussion. How reckless the policy-making method is. (April 17,  2010)</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOEA to expand distribution of distinctive local products</HEADLINE>

      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) will push to expand the distribution
network for products specific to localities in the latter half of the year, an
economics official said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Lin Mei-hsueh, deputy director general of the Small and Medium Enterprise
Administration (SMEA) under the ministry, said that adopting the local marketing
concept of "One Town One Product" (OTOP) from Japan, the SMEA started from 1989
to help stimulate distinctive local industry by integrating local resources and
their specialties.</P>
      <P>The government wants to develop industries that have rich historical, cultural
and distinctive features that local people are proud of, Lin said.</P>
      <P>But currently the display and distribution network for these types of products
is limited to places such as the Taiwan High Speed Rail's Chiayi Station,
Nantou's scenic Sun Moon Lake resort and the Dream Mall in Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>Lin noted that 70 percent of the products are agriculture produce or area
specialities, with the local governments deciding on the display and
distribution network.</P>
      <P>"To expand the distribution, the SMEA is planning to push for its own
distribution networks in the latter half of the year," Lin said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Cell phone shipments to reach nearly 1.6 billion units: TRI</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The shipment of global mobile phones in 2010 is expected to grow by about 12
percent to nearly 1.59 billion units due to increased demand in emerging
markets, the Taiwan-based Topology Research Institute (TRI) forecast Saturday.</P>
      <P>According to the private think tank, handset shipment growth will be driven
largely by key emerging markets such as India and China.</P>
      <P>The number of mobile phone users in India is expected to increase from 400
million at present to over 700 million in 2012 -- boosted by telecom tax changes
and liberalization measures, the TRI said. China's  effort to promote 3G
services  is also expected  to substantially increase its mobile phone
shipments.</P>
      <P>Hsieh Yu-shan, an analyst at the TRI, said that 2010 will be the year of the
smartphone, adding that a sharp growth in sales is expected to begin from Q2.</P>
      <P>The global smartphone penetration rate, which was 13 to 15 percent in 2009, is
expected to reach 18 to 20 percent this year, and 25 to 28 percent next year,
Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>Although global cell phone shipments have continued to increase, shipments and
market percentage of mobile phones from Taiwanese manufacturers have been
decreasing over the past few years, the TRI said.</P>
      <P>The shipment of Taiwanese mobile phones is expected to drop to 56 million units
this year, compared to 59.7 million units in 2009 and 89 million in 2008, it
said.</P>
      <P>The percentage of Taiwanese mobile phones among global shipments is expected to
decrease to 3.5 percent this year, compared to 4.2 percent in 2009 and 6.6
percent in 2008, it added.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said, however, that shrinking shipments of Taiwanese mobile phones may not
be necessarily negative, because most Taiwanese manufacturers were trying to
reposition themselves and move toward producing more high-end mobile phones.</P>
      <P>If Taiwanese cell phone manufacturers only focus on shipment and revenue
numbers, their gross profit margins will continue to drop, she added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan players dream of hitting the hardwood in China</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 17 (CNA)
04/17/10  16:03:27

    <TEXT>
      <P>Despite limited success, most Taiwanese basketball players who opted to play in
China said they didn't regret the decision, which may have alienated them from
local basketball but is symbolic and meaningful for their careers.</P>
      <P>An all-time high of five players left their teams in the local professional
Super Basketball League (SBL) last year to play in the Chinese Basketball
Association (CBA) . They said the CBA, a growing league of 17 teams, offers
higher salaries and better competition.</P>
      <P>Local players wouldn't have left if the basketball environment was better in
Taiwan, said Lin Chih-chieh, formerly one of the most popular players in Taiwan
and a national team regular who spent last season with the China's Zhejiang
Lions.</P>
      <P>Despite its spot as the second most popular sport after baseball, professional
basketball in Taiwan is still said to lack the planning, organization and vision
necessary for the game to develop.</P>
      <P>In its seventh year, the average attendance at SBL games is under 1,000. Lacking
sponsors and advertisers, the majority of team revenues comes from television
broadcast fees. The league didn't allow foreign players until its fifth year and
at one point considered a monthly salary maximum of NT$120,000 (US$3,826) per
player so that teams could keep their budgets down.</P>
      <P>Discontented with the current status and unknown future of the league, players
started to look for a way out.</P>
      <P>Playing in China was an easy and natural answer because of the common language
and culture, as well as the fact the Chinese league blossomed in recent years as
the country's economic power rose, Lin said. The CBA is now capable of hiring
active National Basketball Association (NBA) players, such as former New York
Knicks guard Stephon Marbury.</P>
      <P>And there are other Taiwanese players in China. Chen Hsin-an played for the
Dongguan Leopards in Guangdong province and Yen Hsin-shu played for the Shanghai
Sharks last season, and Hsu Hao-cheng and Lin Kwan-lun both joined Shanxi
Zhongyu this year.</P>
      <P>It was not the first time domestic basketball lost talent to China. Cheng Chih-
lung was the first Taiwanese player in the CBA when he signed with the Shanghai
Sharks in 1999, joining current Houston Rockets center Yao Ming in 1999. The
Sina Lions became the first Taiwanese team to play in the Chinese league in
2002-2003.</P>
      <P>While thousands of American players earn a living by playing overseas, it's
unusual for foreign teams to show interest in Taiwanese players. Playing
overseas is seen as proof of a local player's skill and talent.</P>
      <P>Lin was reportedly paid US$15,000 monthly plus incentives -- about four times
what he made in Taiwan. Chen Hsin-an signed a two-year contract for an annual
salary of US$340,000, and even second-string player Lin Kuan-lun was signed for
US$8,000 a month.</P>
      <P>However, part of the Taiwanese players' "China Dream" was not what they had
imagined. Although Lin played an important role in Zhejiang, cracking the
starting lineup and averaging 11.7 points and four rebounds per game, as well as
leading the team to the semifinal, none of the other four played more than 10
minutes per game.</P>
      <P>It's disappointing to get big paychecks but sit on the bench, media quoted Chen
as saying.</P>
      <P>For Lin, he said the training and playing style in Taiwan and China are very
different and that he had learned a lot. Most of all, he said, the facilities
and treatment of players are much better in China. Every team hires a
weightlifting coach, he said.</P>
      <P>"You have to do everything yourself in Taiwan, " he said, adding that he will
play in China again next season and encouraging aspiring Taiwanese players to do
the same.</P>
      <P>Lin said that players have to learn to take care of themselves because their
careers are short and the local league is not going anywhere.</P>
      <P>One staff member from a local team agreed that when it came to money, Taiwan
just couldn't compete.</P>
      <P>"Of course we would like to keep our players on the team, but the salary the
Chinese league is offering is just crazy and we couldn't possibly match that, "
said a team representative who declined to be identified.</P>
      <P>"I really don't think these players help their careers or skills with such
miserable playing time in the games, but they sure make a lot more money," he
said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Talk of the day -- Legislature passes innovation bill</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>04/17/10  16:42:25
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan passed a controversial draft Statute to Encourage
Industrial Innovation late Friday after a marathon debate between lawmakers of
the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) and opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>The bill was designed to pave the way for Taiwan to become a global innovation
hub, in keeping with President Ma Ying-jeou's goals and Premier Wu Den-yih's
directive for more attention to be given to small- and medium-sized enterprises
(SMEs) and to job creation.</P>
      <P>Wu thanked Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng later Friday for the
legislature's support of the bill that aims to benefit both large and small
businesses.</P>
      <P>Although the bill passed in the legislature is different from the original
version submitted by the Executive Yuan, Wu said he is quite satisfied with the
new law that will replace the decades-old Statute for Industrial Upgrading and
help reinvigorate Taiwan's industrial sector.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from local media coverage of the issue:</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>President Ma hailed the passage of the bill,  saying the government is sticking
firmly to its central idea of opening Taiwan to the world.</P>
      <P>According to Ma, the industrial innovation law and a planned Taiwan-China
economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) will be the two key strategic
tools to help enhance Taiwan's innovation and competitiveness.</P>
      <P>The law will allow the government to create a fund to provide capital and
technology assistance to companies. But of the four tax incentive proposals
originally put forth, only one concerning a 10-year tax deduction for business
innovation was retained in the bill.</P>
      <P>The legislature will vote next Tuesday on the KMT's proposed 17 percent
corporate income tax rate, which will require an amendment to the Income Tax
Act.</P>
      <P>However, some critics have said that lowering the corporate income tax from 20
percent to 17 percent will hurt the government's finances.</P>
      <P>Wang Lee-rong, director of the Center for Economic Forecasting of the Chung-Hua
Institute for Economic Research (CIER), warned that the tax cut will lead to a
shortfall of NT$34.3 billion (US$1.1 billion) in government revenue.</P>
      <P>In response, KMT Legislator Lai Shyh-bao said the KMT caucus has proposed
raising the tax rate on companies' undistributed earnings from 10 percent to 15
percent. (April 17, 2010)</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>Acer Inc. Chairman C. T. Wang on Friday expressed support for the proposal to
lower the corporate income tax to 17 percent. "This would help boost Taiwan's
economic development over the next 10 years, " he said.</P>
      <P>Lin Ping-pin, chairman of the National Association of Small and Medium
Enterprises, called for a speedy revision of the Income Tax Act to drop the
corporate income tax to 17 percent, or to 17.5 percent as proposed by the
opposition Democratic Progressive Party.</P>
      <P>Huang Ming-ho, general manager of Victor Taichung Machinery, called the proposal
"belated justice, " saying that traditional businesses have always been taxed 25
percent, in contrast to the almost zero income tax rate for high-tech firms.
"This would help us to significantly improve our profits," he said. (April 17,
2010)</P>
      <P>The Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>Some academics have criticized the clause in the innovation bill that allows
small companies to receive government subsidies for hiring additional workers.</P>
      <P>The bill is meant to help companies sharpen their competitiveness and create
jobs for the public, not to increase jobs by offering government subsidies,
Taiwan Thinktank Chairman Chen Po-chih said.</P>
      <P>Economics Minister Shih Yen-shiang stressed Friday that the revisions to 27 sub-
legislations related to the innovation bill will be completed within three
months of the bill's promulgation, which he said will help spur the upgrade and
transformation of Taiwan businesses.</P>
      <P>KMT caucus whip Lin Hung-chih predicted that the bill will help to expand
Taiwan's GDP by NT$69 billion. (April 17, 2010)</P>

    <HEADLINE>Apple Daily: Hospital disgraces memory of its founder</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>04/17/10  16:48:12
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>It is extremely shameful that Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital became
involved in a case of National Health Insurance (NHI) fraud, which resulted in
the hospital being fined NT$150 million.</P>
      <P>We cannot help but feel sorrow on behalf of the hospital's late founder, Tu
Tsung-ming, a stickler for integrity and ethics, whose memory has now been
tarnished by those who suceeded him.</P>
      <P>According a biography of Tu written by Yang Yu-ling,  Tu (1893-1986) devoted his
entire life to upgrading the quality of the medical profession in Taiwan. He was
the first Taiwan citizen to hold a PhD, which he earned at the University of
Tokyo.</P>
      <P>In 1954, he established the Kaohsiung Medical College -- the forerunner of the
university -- and introduced an honor system under which students who cheated in
exams were flunked. Tu said he was profoundly influenced by the moral education
he received from his elementary school principal, who thought the value of an
individual was determined by his or her moral character, not erudition.</P>
      <P>Despite having such a great founder, the university has turned out skilled
doctors who nonetheless lack any sense of shame. Regardless of whether the
problem lies in the NHI system or the university's education system, the fact
remains that the university has betrayed the purpose of Tu's establishment of
the school in the first place. (April 17, 2010)</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The number of Taiwanese students applying for visas to study abroad remained
between 32,000 and 37,000 annually from 2004 to 2008, despite a growing number
of graduates, an official at the Cabinet-level National Science Council (NSC)
said Saturday.</P>
      <P>According to Ministry of Education statistics, the accumulated number of
graduates with a bachelor's or master's degree in Taiwan rose from around
253,000 people in 2004 to more than 285,000 in 2008.</P>
      <P>The figures suggest a drop in the percentage of graduates seeking advanced
education abroad, said Chang Ching-ray, director general of the NSC'S Department
of International Cooperation.</P>
      <P>Moreover, department researchers found that in recent years, more and more
graduates went abroad for short-term language courses only, instead of acquiring
an academic degree, Chang noted.</P>
      <P>Most graduates stayed in Taiwan for higher education, he said.</P>
      <P>Amid globalization,  Taiwan  needs a pool of talent  with international vision,
Chang said, adding that local young people need to be encouraged to study
abroad.</P>
      <P>To achieve that goal, the NSC has prepared various subsidy programs, including
an academic exchange plan with the German Academic Exchange Service, under which
Taiwan sends up to 30 Ph.D. candidates to Germany every year for research
visits, Chang said.</P>

      <P>Over the past month, there have been two reported incidents of school children

be awarded a medal for "excellence" in the performance of duty. We cannot
comprehend why a teacher has to give a student more than 10 slaps in the face to

      <P>The pressure of competition is gradually distorting education in our schools,

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Saturday that a trade pact with China is a global
economic strategy to help Taiwan reach out to the world.</P>
      <P>"The signing of the cross-strait economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA)
is only the first step, " the president said. "The deal will help Taiwan sign
trade pacts with other countries and further reduce cross-strait tension."</P>
      <P>Ma said that all Taiwan's regional rivals have signed major free trade
agreements  over  the past  decade,  resulting  in the marginalization of
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Taiwan, whose lifeline depends on exports, has seen its global market share
gradually decline, he said. If it fails to do something, exports will face a
grave situation, he added.</P>
      <P>"If we close the door, we will wither. We can only have hope if we open up," the
president said.</P>
      <P>The ECFA is a steppingstone for Taiwan to take part in the economic activities
of East Asia, he continued, adding that closer economic cooperation  with China
will help Taiwan promote its relations with Japan and keep other countries from
having to "take sides."</P>
      <P>The president made the remarks at Xiulang Elementary School in Yonghe City,
Taipei County, as part of his island-wide tour to drum up support for the trade
pact.</P>
      <P>Accompanying the president were Vice Premier Eric Liluan Chu, Minister of
Economic Affairs Shih Yen-hsiang, and officials from the Council of Labor
Affairs, Council of Agriculture and Mainland Affairs Council.</P>
      <P>The president and other officials reaffirmed the principles for signing the
ECFA: Help local people do business and allow no more than the current
1,000-plus Chinese agricultural products to enter Taiwan from China.</P>
      <P>The government will also not allow Chinese laborers to enter the Taiwanese
market, they said. It will solicit tariff concessions for Taiwan  exports,
protect  the  investment  rights  of  Taiwan businesspeople and protect
intellectual property rights.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Vice President Vincent Siew said at a forum in Taipei Saturday that
Taiwan cannot shut its door and allow its rivals to jockey for position in the
Chinese market.</P>
      <P>Siew echoed Ma's remarks, saying Taiwan could use the trade deal with China as a
"steppingstone" to signing free trade agreements with other countries to avoid
being marginalized.</P>

      <P>Kuo Shan-huei, a former chairman of the Taiwan Businessmen  Association
Dongguan,  was narrowly elected Saturday to head the Association of Taiwan
Investment Enterprises on the Mainland -- seen as Taiwan's chamber of commerce
in China.</P>
      <P>Kuo defeated incumbent Chairman Chang Han-wen 101-100 after two rounds of
voting. A total of 203 members were present.</P>
      <P>Many voters described the three-candidate election as "intense." The third
candidate, Lin Po-feng, lost in the first round of voting with 17 votes, while
Chang received 96 and Kuo 89. A second round of voting was held because none of
the competitors won more than half of the votes.</P>
      <P>Kuo is the founder of the Lacquer Craft group, one of the world's largest wooden
furniture makers. He was a vice chairman of the association of Taiwanese
enterprises in China when it was established on April 16, 2007.</P>
      <P>On Saturday, Kuo won a three-year term as chairman of the business group.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou called Saturday for the Taiwan public to remain alert
against influenza HINI and he praised the Department of Health (DOH) for its
work since the outbreak of the virus last year.</P>
      <P>In conversation with Health Minsiter Yaung Chih-liang in the president's weekly
online journal, Ma urged the public to stay on guard against the potentially
fatal disease.</P>
      <P>Yaung described the DOH's immunization efforts as the most important battle in
Taiwan's public health history since the eruption of SARS in 2003.</P>
      <P>"Among the 32 members (and observers) of the Organization for Economic
Cooperation (OECD), Taiwan has the third-lowest H1N1-related mortality rate,
which indicates that the country's medical treatment of the virus is one of the
best in the world, " Yaung said.</P>
      <P>This can be attributed to the fast flow of information in Taiwan and to a sound
public health network facilitated by the National Health Insurance system, Yaung
added.</P>
      <P>According to Yaung, Taiwan's 70 percent H1N1 immunization rate among school
children is also the highest in the world.</P>
      <P>Although an H1N1 command center was temporarily dismantled by the DOH in late
February after 303 days of operation, the president said, the public should not
let down its guard against the virus as it might stage a comeback this year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Government finances face serious shortfall: experts</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>After the disputed Statute to Encourage Industrial Innovation passed the
Legislative Yuan late Friday, the government needs to propose supplementary
measures to improve its financial shortfall, experts said Saturday.</P>
      <P>The hotly debated corporate income tax rate was not included in the statute, but
will be screened by legislators April 20 after the ruling Kuomintang (KMT)
caucus submits a proposal to cut the rate from 20 percent to 17 percent.</P>
      <P>According to the Ministry of Finance, if the corporate income tax rate is
slashed to 17 percent under the new law -- which aims to provide subsidies to
business and industry for innovation -- it could create a shortfall of NT$34.3
billion in government revenue.</P>
      <P>Wu Chung-shu, the dean of National Dong Hwa University's College of Management
in Hualien, said that in the long run, the government needs to raise some tax
rates to make up for the shortfall.</P>
      <P>Wu pointed out that Taiwan's existing value-added tax rate is 5 percent,
substantially lower than the more than 10 percent tax rate in most other
countries.</P>
      <P>While tax breaks will hurt the government's revenue, the aging population and
the high dependency ratio will continue to increase government debt, Wu said.</P>
      <P>Wang Lee-rong, director of the Chung-Hua Institute for Economic Research's
(CIER's) Center for Economic Forecasting, also warned that the tax cut would
make the government's financial burden heavier.</P>
      <P>The CIER estimated that Taiwan's economic growth this year will contract by 0.91
percentage points, falling from a projected growth rate of 4.99 percent to 4.08
percent, if the government were to slash public investment to balance its
finances.</P>
      <P>However, Wang said that the forecast appeared to be conservative as it did not
calculate potential impact from a planned Taiwan-China economic cooperation
framework agreement (ECFA) and the appreciation of the Chinese yuan.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  opposition  Democratic  Progressive  Party (DPP) Chairperson Tsai
Ing-wen said Saturday that the innovation law would only increase -- instead of
reduce -- the government's financial burden.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A dozen foreign diplomats and their family members volunteered at a recycling
activity organized by the Buddhist Compassion Relief Tzu Chi Foundation in
Taipei Saturday.</P>
      <P>At a recycling station in a suburban area in Neihu, the eco-friendly envoys from
Taiwan's diplomatic allies in Central America and elsewhere were shown how to
use plastic bottles to make blankets, scarves or polo shirts. They then helped
with packaging or giving the products a final touch, like ironing labels onto
the blankets.</P>
      <P>The event, organized by the foundation, was held to celebrate the upcoming Earth
Day on April 22.</P>
      <P>The diplomats later spent an hour separating used plastic bags and taking apart
discarded VHS tapes to pick out valuable components.</P>
      <P>"We don't call this 'trash.' We call it 'gold' that will turn into 'love,'" said
Wang Ming-li, a foundation member.</P>
      <P>However, she said, it is a pity that because people think plastic bottles are
easily recyclable, they use too many of them.</P>
      <P>Wang said several senior citizens help out at the station regularly just to do a
good turn. "One man who had a stroke comes here every day for rehabilitation,"
she added.</P>
      <P>Njabuliso Gwebu,  the Taipei-based ambassador of Swaziland, described the
activity as "educational."</P>
      <P>Touching one of the blankets, Ruby Caines, a relative of the ambassador from St.
Kitts and Nevis, said, "It's so soft. I couldn't believe this."</P>
      <P>"What Tzu Chi is doing is recycling and at the same time, they are helping the
needy and poor people in the world, " said Efrain Novelo, Belize's ambassador in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"Today is the time to save the Earth, not tomorrow," he said.</P>
      <P>Tzu Chi has given away more than 250,000 such blankets to homeless people, poor
people or disaster victims in 20 countries since the foundation unveiled the
blanket in 2006.</P>
      <P>It takes 70 to 80 600cc plastic bottles to make a blanket that is 230
centimeters by 180 centimeters.</P>
      <P>The foundation has 4,500 recycling stations around the country and 70,000
volunteers.</P>
      <P>Around 200 groups from Spain, the United States, Thailand, Indonesia, Singapore,
the Philippines and other countries visited the recycling station in Neihu in
2009.</P>
      <P>"They don't just come from different countries, but also from different
religions to learn about Tzu Chi's recycling efforts, " foundation member Lin
Cheng-yuan said.</P>

      <P>The clouds of ash from a volcano in Iceland, which have drifted into the skies
over northern Europe and caused the grounding of many flights in that area, are
unlikely to reach Taiwan, an official of Taiwan's Central Weather Bureau said
Saturday.</P>
      <P>Chen Ming-tien, director of the bureau's Weather Forecast Center, said the plume
of ash thrown up by a volcanic eruption in Iceland was six kilometers high, but
"it was not huge in terms of volume."</P>
      <P>Most of the ash would remain in the troposphere and the grit would decrease as
the plume of ash spreads out, he said.</P>
      <P>Chen also predicted that the volcanic ash will not affect the global weather. To
cause such a big impact, an eruption would have to send ash more than 10 km into
the air, he said.</P>
      <P>In 1991, the ash cloud from the eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines
rose 15 km. Citing research results, Chen said thick drifts of ash from that
eruption were found to have blocked the sun's rays,  causing an average 0.5
degrees Celsius drop in global temperatures.</P>

      <P>Shih Ming-teh, a former chairman of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party

following the 1979 Kaohsiung Incident.</P>
      <P>The book is intended to mark the 30th anniversary of the nine-day military-court
trial, in which he was one of the defendants. Shih held the book-launching event
at the Jing-Mei Human Rights Memorial and Cultural Park in Sindian, Taipei
County -- the original site of the "first tribunal" where the trials took place.</P>
      <P>"I never thought that I would revisit the trial scene alive, " said Shih, who
was jailed for 10 years after being convicted of sedition for the Kaohsiung
Incident.</P>
      <P>Shih said the purpose of the book is to clarify the historical truth regarding
the trials. He said he feels very sad about the current situation in Taiwan,
which he described as "having no sense of right and wrong, no truth and no
justice."</P>
      <P>He called on politicians in the country to show ideals, a sense of mission and
an ability to self-reflect, adding that they should tell their supporters
exactly what they are leading the country toward.</P>
      <P>Also known as the Formosa Incident, the Kaohsiung Incident took place on Dec.
10, 1979, when a group of opposition activists held a demonstration on Human

      <P>The Kuomintang (KMT) government cracked down on the protest and arrested many of

      <P>The new industrial innovation bill and a planned cross-Taiwan Strait trade pact
are "injections" needed to transform Taiwan into a regional commercial hub,
President Ma Ying-jeou said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Stressing that "opening Taiwan to the world" is the focus of the government's
economic policy, the president said the bill and the Taiwan-China economic
cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) are strategic tools to upgrade Taiwan's
economy.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan companies can make big money if they reach out, like the Won Won and
Master Kang groups," he said.</P>
      <P>He pledged to allow the Legislative Yuan to closely scrutinize the ECFA before
it is signed.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks in a meeting with Taipei County residents to explain the
importance of the newly passed Statute to Encourage Industrial Innovation and
the proposed ECFA with China.</P>
      <P>However, the president said, local companies also need to go international as
part of the globalization effort. "We must not rely solely on the China market,"
he stressed.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Vice President Vicente Siew said Taiwan products need to be
innovative and to be sold with added value in more markets.</P>
      <P>"The passage of the industrial innovation bill means that Taiwan's economic
development will enter a new era over the next 10 to 20 years, " he said. "The
ECFA will be next, as Taiwan-made products will need an institutionalized
mechanism to avoid risks in the Chinese market."</P>
      <P>With other countries striving to seize a greater share of the Chinese market,
Taiwan cannot continue with its closed door policy, he said.</P>
      <P>"The ECFA will serve as a steppingstone to Taiwan signing free trade agreements
with other countries and will help to prevent its marginalization," he added.</P>
      <P>But Tsai Ing-wen,  chairwoman of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party
which has been critical of the ECFA, panned the innovation bill, calling it a
poor piece of legislation.</P>
      <P>"It will not help to reduce the government's financial burden nor will it help
companies to gain fair treatment by the government," she said.</P>
      <P>The controversial Statute to Encourage Industrial Innovation was passed in the
Legislative Yuan Friday. The law, along with the amendments to corporate tax
statute to be scrutinized next week, will lower the corporate income tax rate
from 20 percent to 17 percent for both traditional and hi-tech businesses.
According to aresearch institute, the tax cut will result in a shortfall of
NT$34.3 billion in government revenue.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) said Saturday that of all new U.S. beef products
to be imported into Taiwan, tongues will be subject to the most rigorous
inspections.</P>
      <P>Kang Jaw-Jou, director general of the DOH's Food and Drug Administration, said
that because of the higher risks associated with beef tongues, every carton of
that product will be examined.</P>
      <P>Kang made the remarks in response to an announcement Friday by the U.S.
Department of Agriculture (USDA) that exports of beef products to Taiwan will
include bones with meat, hanging tenders, tongues, penises, testicles, tails,
tendons, and skirts (diaphragm) derived from cattle less than 30 months of age
slaughtered on or after April 1.</P>
      <P>Kang said that except for tongues, all other beef parts will be subject to 5
percent examination -- the same level as for U.S. bone-in beef that was allowed
in earlier.</P>
      <P>He said that the new beef parts meet Taiwan's law on food safety, and that
Taiwan still maintains its ban on U.S. beef skulls, brains, eyes, spinal chords,
ground beef, offal and related products.</P>
      <P>The importers of U.S. beef parts, other than tongues, on the new list will be
required to apply to the Ministry of Economic Affairs' Bureau of Foreign Trade
for import permission, and the DOH will conduct the checks on the products.</P>
      <P>The Consumers' Foundation demanded Saturday that the DOH and the Ministry  of
Foreign Affairs clearly explain whether  allowing importation of the new U.S.
beef products means offal will be included.</P>
      <P>Chairman of the foundation Hsieh Tien-jen said he has reminded the DOH that the
U.S. and Taiwan can review the beef protocol 180 days after it was signed.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said that the USDA's latest announcement proves that the foundation's
worries are not unwarranted.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and the United States signed a protocol last October to allow the entry
of bone-in beef and other beef products, including ground beef and offal, that
had previously been banned out of concern over bovine spongiform encephalopathy
(BSE), or mad cow disease.</P>
      <P>But due to public outcry, the legislature amended the food safety law to
effectively bar U.S.ground beef, beef offal and other beef parts such as the
skull, eyes and intestines from access to Taiwan's markets.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said that consumers should not let down their guard despite the
legislature's action.</P>
      <P>"In order to protect their own health, consumers should actively join a
signature drive for a national referendum on reopening beef talks with the
United States," Hsieh said.</P>

      <P>The travel plans of some 2,000 Taiwanese were affected as a hazardous cloud of
volcanic ash from Iceland forced the closure of airports and the delay or

Saturday.</P>
      <P>According  to the Tourism  Bureau  under the Ministry  of Transportation and
Communications, 12 local travel agencies were affected by the chaos, while a
total of 70 tour groups organized by the agencies were either stranded in Europe
or could not proceed with their travel plans.</P>
      <P>According to local travel agencies, tours to Europe have been popular since the
beginning of the year, with a 30 percent increase in the number of tour groups
recorded in the first few months compared to the same period last year. The
tourists were mostly retired people and newly wedded couples, they added.</P>
      <P>Most of the travel agencies affected by the volcanic eruption in Iceland said
they could do nothing but face their losses because it was an unpredictable
natural disaster.</P>
      <P>Chen Shu-chuang of the Travel Quality Assurance Association acknowledged that
although the tour packages were all insured, the payments would not be enough to
cover the losses.</P>
      <P>The insurance companies will pay only NT$2,000 a day for each traveler stranded
in Europe, but the cost of food and accommodation there is more than NT$4,000
per person per day, he said. This means the travel agencies will have to meet

    <HEADLINE>U.S. beef tongues will be subject to rigorous checks: DOH</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) said Saturday that of all new U.S. beef products
to be imported into Taiwan, tongues will be subject to the most rigorous
inspections.</P>
      <P>Kang Jaw-Jou, director general of the DOH's Food and Drug Administration, said
that because of the higher risks associated with beef tongues, every carton of
that product will be examined.</P>
      <P>Kang made the remarks in response to an announcement Friday by the U.S.
Department of Agriculture (USDA) that exports of beef products to Taiwan will
include bones with meat, hanging tenders, tongues, penises, testicles, tails,
tendons, and skirts (diaphragm) derived from cattle less than 30 months of age
slaughtered on or after April 1.</P>
      <P>Kang said that except for tongues, all other beef parts will be subject to 5
percent examination -- the same level as for U.S. bone-in beef that was allowed
in earlier.</P>
      <P>He said that the new beef parts meet Taiwan's law on food safety, and that
Taiwan still maintains its ban on U.S. beef skulls, brains, eyes, spinal chords,
ground beef, offal and related products.</P>
      <P>The importers of U.S. beef parts, other than tongues, on the new list will be
required to apply to the Ministry of Economic Affairs' Bureau of Foreign Trade
for import permission, and the DOH will conduct the checks on the products.</P>
      <P>The Consumers' Foundation demanded Saturday that the DOH and the Ministry  of
Foreign Affairs clearly explain whether  allowing importation of the new U.S.
beef products means offal will be included.</P>
      <P>Chairman of the foundation Hsieh Tien-jen said he has reminded the DOH that the
U.S. and Taiwan can review the beef protocol 180 days after it was signed.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said that the USDA's latest announcement proves that the foundation's
worries are not unwarranted.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and the United States signed a protocol last October to allow the entry
of bone-in beef and other beef products, including ground beef and offal, that
had previously been banned out of concern over bovine spongiform encephalopathy
(BSE), or mad cow disease.</P>
      <P>But due to public outcry, the legislature amended the food safety law to
effectively bar U.S.ground beef, beef offal and other beef parts such as the
skull, eyes and intestines from access to Taiwan's markets.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said that consumers should not let down their guard despite the
legislature's action.</P>
      <P>"In order to protect their own health, consumers should actively join a
signature drive for a national referendum on reopening beef talks with the
United States," Hsieh said.</P>

      <P>The travel plans of some 2,000 Taiwanese were affected as a hazardous cloud of
volcanic ash from Iceland forced the closure of airports and the delay or
cancellation of many flights in Europe, Taiwan tourism authorities said
Saturday.</P>
      <P>According  to the Tourism  Bureau  under the Ministry  of Transportation and
Communications, 12 local travel agencies were affected by the chaos, while a
total of 70 tour groups organized by the agencies were either stranded in Europe
or could not proceed with their travel plans.</P>
      <P>According to local travel agencies, tours to Europe have been popular since the
beginning of the year, with a 30 percent increase in the number of tour groups
recorded in the first few months compared to the same period last year. The
tourists were mostly retired people and newly wedded couples, they added.</P>
      <P>Most of the travel agencies affected by the volcanic eruption in Iceland said
they could do nothing but face their losses because it was an unpredictable
natural disaster.</P>
      <P>Chen Shu-chuang of the Travel Quality Assurance Association acknowledged that
although the tour packages were all insured, the payments would not be enough to
cover the losses.</P>
      <P>The insurance companies will pay only NT$2,000 a day for each traveler stranded
in Europe, but the cost of food and accommodation there is more than NT$4,000
per person per day, he said. This means the travel agencies will have to meet
the difference, he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>China Times: Gov't policy tested as '22K' nears expiry date</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>04/18/10  15:27:03
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A government program, under which new university graduates working as interns at
local companies are paid NT$22,000 a month, will expire soon after one year in
operation. The expiration of the program, commonly known as the 22K program,
will test the graduates' readiness to formally enter the job market and the
success of the government's efforts to rev up employment.</P>
      <P>Since last summer, a total of 46,000 university and college graduate have
entered the internship program. Currently, 29,000 of them are still in the
program, while the others have either found better jobs or quit for assorted
reasons.</P>
      <P>The government plans to launch a new 22K program on June 1 for another 30,000
new graduates. However, this time around, employers of the interns will be
required to pay NT$12,000 of the NT$22,000 monthly salary and the government the
other NT$10,000.</P>
      <P>By offering immediate job opportunities to new graduates, the 22K program may
have helped to reduce the country's unemployment rate, but we see it as more of
an effort to delay the explosion of the unemployment rate, rather than a
solution to the problem.</P>
      <P>However, it would be unfair to deny the value of the program. At a time when
most private companies were reluctant to hire new employees because of the
global economic slump last year, the program served a three-pronged purpose --
benefiting the business sector, helping to reduce unemployment and allowing
fresh graduates to acquire some work experience before embarking on their
careers.</P>
      <P>Nonetheless, before launching the new program, the government should assess
whether it would be cost-efficient and not a waste of taxpayers' money and the
graduates' time. (April 18, 2010).</P>

      <P>A 20-member medical team assembled by the Red Cross Society of the Republic of
China, departed for Xining, western China Sunday, to provide assistance to
survivors of a deadly 7.1-magnitude earthquake that struck there April 14.</P>
      <P>Chang Huan-chin, leader of the team and superintendent of Lishin Hospital in
Pingzhen, Taoyuan County, said before his departure that his team consists of
medical personnel from Taipei City Hospital, National Cheng Kung University
Hospital in Taiwan City, and Lishin Hospital.</P>
      <P>Chang, whose experience includes relief work in the wake of the Sept. 21, 1999
quake in central Taiwan, the earthquake of May 12, 2008 in Sichuan, western
China and other disasters, said that his team is carrying 1,000 kg of medicines,
which is the maximum allowed because of the limited airlift capacity in the
disaster area.</P>
      <P>Most of the medicine would be used for preliminary surgery, according to Chang.</P>
      <P>Given that the disaster area is located at an altitude of 4,000 meters, Chang
said, the weather will be a severe challenge for his team, although each member
is equipped with up to 15 kg of gear that includes heavy coats and medicine for
altitude sickness.</P>
      <P>The medical team is expected to arrive in Xining, the capital of Qinghai
Province, Sunday night, via Hong Kong and Beijing.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile Cheng Zongliang, a spokesman for China's Red Cross Society in Beijing,
expressed gratitude for the assistance offered by its Taiwan counterpart.</P>
      <P>Cheng told China's Xinhua news agency that the Taiwan medical team will work in
the disaster area for one week.</P>
      <P>The 7.1-magnitude temblor that struck western China on April 14 has left 1,484
dead and more than 12,088 injured, according to Chinese authorities. The death
toll is expected to climb, as 312 people are still unaccounted for and hopes of
finding any more survivors are fading three days after the disaster.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Talk of the day--Goldman Sachs case could slightly affect Taiex</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>04/18/10  16:42:17
(By Y.L. Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Following the accusations of fraud against Goldman Sachs by the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission (SEC) which sent global stock markets plunging last
Friday, financial shares on the local bourse are expected to lead the local
stock market lower Monday, analysts predicted Sunday.</P>
      <P>In addition, because foreign investors began selling Friday after the Taiex set
a new high last week, the market is expected to correct itself on the first two
days of the coming week, the analysts said.</P>
      <P>However, a rebound is possible in the next few days because the fraud case is an
isolated one and will have limited impact on the local bourse, according to the
analysts.</P>
      <P>The market could be boosted on the last few trading days of next week by bargain
buying and by a legislative vote Tuesday on an amendment to the Corporate Income
Tax Act designed to lower the corporate income tax rate to 17 percent, the
analysts added.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from local media coverage of the issue:</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>The Taiwan stock market is expected to open lower Monday, reflecting the effects
of fraud accusations against Wall Street giant Goldman Sachs, with financial
shares likely to drop the most, analysts said.</P>
      <P>U.S. stocks have plunged the steepest since February, as the SEC's accusations
against Goldman Sachs Group Inc. have given rise to concern that the fallout
from the financial crisis is not over.</P>
      <P>Goldman Sachs shares plummeted 13 percent, the biggest drop in 15 months, after
the SEC sued the company for misstating and omitting facts about collateralized
debt obligations.</P>
      <P>The charges have badly shaken global financial markets, even hitting the price
of gold, oil and the currency markets.</P>
      <P>If the fraud suit spurs selling, particularly among foreign institutional
investors, it could be quite a challenge for Taiwan's stock market to remain
above the 8,000-point mark, analysts said.</P>
      <P>However, Chen Kuan-rong, chief of an asset management company, predicted that if
the Goldman Sachs's fraud case is an isolated one, the local bourse would open
lower Monday but there would be no long-term impact on the fundamentals of the
market.</P>
      <P>With the Taiex already reaching this year's high of around 8,100, if no new
energy is brought into the market, the Taiex could pull back to between 7,600
and 7,800, he added. (April 18, 2010).</P>
      <P>Economic Daily News:</P>
      <P>Wu Zu-wang, a fund manager at Shin Kong Investment Trust Co., said while he does
not expect the fraud case to heavily affect the Taiwan stock market, he thinks
the fallout from a recent volcanic eruption in Iceland could expand.</P>
      <P>The eruption has disrupted flights throughout Europe and sent shares in China
Airlines and EVA air plummeting last Friday, Wu noted.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, Wu said, China's bright economic outlook for the year could
help bolster the local bourse.</P>
      <P>World Expo 2010 Shanghai, the three-day Labor Day holiday and an appreciation of
the Chinese yuan are factors that could affect the local market, Wu added.</P>
      <P>Liu Kuan-hsi, general manager of Masterlink Securities Investment Advisory
Corp., said that if the Taiex cannot remain above its monthly moving average of
7,992, that could spur selling pressure.</P>
      <P>Because the volcano situation is uncertain, it is especially difficult to
estimate its effects, which casts a shadow on stock markets around the world, he
added. (April 18, 2010).</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) under the Department of Health confirmed
Sunday that a woman who died April 14 after eating dried beancurd and preserved
oysters had a botulism infection.</P>
      <P>CDC Deputy Director Lin Ting said lab tests confirmed that the 44-year-old woman
from Miaoli County had a botulism infection, which is usually caused by a nerve
toxin produced by clostridium botulinum bacteria.</P>
      <P>Several mice were injected with the woman's blood serum and they died within 24
hours, Lin added.</P>
      <P>However, further lab tests will be required to determine what type of botulism
caused the woman's death, he said.</P>
      <P>It was also still not known whether it was the dried beancurd or the preserved
oysters which the woman and her mother-in-law ate that caused the fatal botulism
infection, Lin said.</P>
      <P>The woman's 71-year-old mother-in-law has been on intubation at Taichung
Veterans General Hospital in central Taiwan since she fell ill after eating the
beancurd and oysters. Lab tests have confirmed that she also has a botulism
infection. She has received two doses of botulismus-antitoxin that were rushed
to the hospital by the CDC and which saved her life, according to Lin.</P>
      <P>However, the daughter-in-law was not that lucky, as she was rushed to a
different hospital in Taoyuan County, northern Taiwan which was not alert enough
to seek emergency assistance from the CDC for the treatment of botulism, Lin
said.</P>
      <P>Samples of two packs of dried beancurd and a can of salted oysters that were
found in the women's home in Miaoli were retrieved by the Food and Drug
Administration for testing, but the lab reports will not be available for two
weeks, the CDC said.</P>
      <P>The two Miaoli women were the third and fourth botulism cases this year,
following a mother and daughter in Taoyuan County who were diagnosed in early
April, the CDC said. The Taoyuan mother and daughter were treated with
botulismus-antitoxin.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Taoyuan County Public Health Bureau on Friday closed operations
for two weeks at the two companies where the dried beancurd was made and ordered
that the products be pulled from the shelves of major grocery stores.</P>
      <P>However, the companies have complained of mistreatment, saying that their
products were safe and were made in line with government standards. They
complained that the two-week suspension will cost them hundreds of thousands of
New Taiwan dollars.</P>
      <P>"I hope the relevant tests will be completed soon so that my company's name can
be cleared, " said Tseng Fan-Hsiang, owner of Cheng Hsiang Foods Co.</P>
      <P>The latest incident has also resulted in declining business in Taoyuan County's
Dasi township -- the center of dried beancurd production in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Huang Chien-chia, president of Tafang Foods, a well-established manufacturer of
dried beancurd and related products in Dasi, said his store's business has
shrunk by one-third this weekend.</P>
      <P>Chiang Chiu-yun, the owner of another company known as Wan Li Hsiang which was
established in 1921, said business at her store has also been affected by the
incident, but added that her faithful customers were not at all fazed.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The father of one of the world's top-ranking golfers, Yani Tseng of Taiwan, said
Sunday his daughter is eager to gain the sponsorship of local companies.</P>
      <P>Tseng Mao-hsin made the remarks while confirming that the Huabin Group in china
has offered to sign a long-term sponsorship contract with his daughter, who
vaulted into second place in the women's world golf rankings after she won the
Kraft Nabisco Championship earlier this month.</P>
      <P>The local Chinese-language daily China Times reported Sunday that the Huabin
Group intends to sign a five-year,  US$25 million sponsorship contract with the
21-year-old Taiwanese golfer.</P>
      <P>Responding to the report, Tseng Mao-hsin said that as a Taiwanese citizen, his
daughter would prefer to collaborate with Taiwanese business groups, but
regrettably none of them have stepped forward so far.</P>
      <P>Regarding the Huabin offer, Tseng Mao-hsin said the two sides are still
discussing the details of the contract.</P>
      <P>"We are not sure whether a sponsorship contract will eventually be signed, as we
have not yet come to terms on certain details, " he said.</P>
      <P>To be honest, Tseng Mao-shin, said the Huabin Group's offer is far from
attractive because the contract will not cover Tseng Yani's travel costs to
participate in LPGA tournaments.</P>
      <P>"As a matter of fact, LPGA tours comprise the largest chunk of Yani's annual
expenses... therefore, the Huabin offer is less than attractive in real terms,"
he said.</P>
      <P>Another aspect that has to be considered is Huabin's demand that Yani Tseng
terminate all other contracts with her existing sponsors of golf clubs,
sunglasses, sportswear and relevant sports gear once she signs a deal with
Huabin, her father said.</P>
      <P>Apart from Huabin, he said, several brokerage agencies are also negotiating
sponsorship contracts with his daughter.</P>
      <P>Yani Tseng is scheduled to return to Taiwan April 25 when various sponsorship
contract issues will be further discussed, he said. Aside from soaring up the
world rankings, Yani Tseng catapulted to the top of other major lists by winning
the April 4 Kraft Nabisco Championship in Rancho Mirage, California, the first
major tournament of the season. Her US$300,000 first prize made her the leading
prize money winner on the LPGA Tour after its first four events of the year.</P>
      <P>The Huabin Group was founded by Yen Bin,  a Thai-Chinese businessman. Over the
past decades, the group has grown into a multinational enterprise in four major
sectors, including consumer goods, modern service industries, sports, arts and
culture and financial services and investments. The group has offices in many
countries around the world.</P>
      <P>Yen Bin ranks 10th on the Hurun Rich List, an annual list of the 100 wealthiest
people in China.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan composer breathes new life into traditional music</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>04/18/10  18:59:59</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>In the musical world of Huang Chen-ming there are no limitations or boundaries.
He sees no problem combining traditional Taiwanese and Chinese music with
elements of Western rock, African music or Scottish folk songs.</P>
      <P>Wang, the founder of the Chai Found Music Workshop, has set himself the goal of
broadening the scope of traditional music and creating more opportunities for
Taiwan musicians to play all over the world.</P>
      <P>Since his return from the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, Canada earlier this
year and a tour of several United States cities, Huang thinks he has been moving
closer to this goal.</P>
      <P>His life mission is to promote traditional music, he told the Central News
Agency.</P>
      <P>"I want to create limitless possibilities for traditional music and I hope more
composers worldwide would join us," he said.</P>
      <P>Since he established the music workshop 19 years ago, Huang has brought together
a group of musicians that include pipa player Lin Hui-Kuan and di player Wu
Chung-Hsien.</P>
      <P>As the group's artistic director and composer, Huang uses traditional Chinese
instruments as a central thematic element and has created a unique musical space
that not only facilitates the performance of Sizhu music -- Chinese chamber
music -- but also provides  other composers  with an inspirational  platform for
experimentation.</P>
      <P>The group preserves traditional elements by fully exploiting the distinctive
sounds of Eastern instruments, while also introducing light innovation into the
genre of folk and world music. The aim is to create a groundbreaking expression
of the diversity, vitality and richness of Taiwanese contemporary music,
according to Huang.</P>
      <P>He thinks that traditional music could encompass all kinds of experimentation.
One of his latest concepts is that music should not only be heard, but also be
seen.</P>
      <P>With this in mind, he plans to incorporate tai-chi into his group's musical
performances.</P>
      <P>"All of our musicians will begin to learn tai-chi in May so that they can
express that art form through music and with their bodies," he said.</P>
      <P>As part of his efforts to expand the expression of traditional music, Huang last
year held a composers' competition based on the theme of the ancient Chinese
"five movements" philosophy which describes the interactions and relationships
among five elements -- wood, water, earth, fire and metal.</P>
      <P>The competition attracted many composers from the West and the East, eight of
whom were chosen to present their works at a concert.</P>
      <P>Huang is holding a similar competition this year, this time under the theme of
yin-yang, which describes the interconnectedness and interdependency of seeming
polar forces in the natural world.</P>
      <P>"In this competition, we could see quite different and very creative works from
Western and Eastern composers, which could also open another window for the
enrichment of traditional music," Huang said.</P>
      <P>The winning compositions will be presented at a concert in October, he added.</P>
      <P>Over the years, Huang 's group has been invited to several international
festivals such as the Barcelona Arts Festival in Spain in 1992, the Costa Rica
Culture Festival in 1998, the Hoergaenge Contemporary Music Festival in Austria
in 2000, the Cologne Music Festival in Germany 2001,  the Huddersfield
Contemporary Music Festival in England in 2004; and the Festival Dimension in
Seoul, Korea in 2009.</P>
      <P>"This year, we will have more opportunities to go abroad, to connect with other
countries, including France where we will perform with musicians in Paris at the
end of the year" Huang said.</P>
      <P>"But this is also the year for training for a great future, " he added. CNA

    <HEADLINE>ECFA early harvest list to be drafted soon: official</HEADLINE>

      <P>The third round of talks between Taiwan and China later this month on a proposed
trade pact is expected to produce a clear draft of an early harvest list of
products and services for tariff concessions, an economics official said Sunday.</P>
      <P>During the second round of technical talks, Taiwan and China reached consensus
on several aspects of the proposed Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement
(ECFA), the official added.</P>
      <P>Negotiations on financial services between the two sides will be held ahead of
the third round of ECFA talks, the official said.</P>
      <P>A panel of experts, commissioned by the Ministry of Finance's Department of
Customs Administration, has been in consultation with their Chinese counterparts
on the details  of place-of-origin regulations for imported products, he noted.</P>
      <P>The issue includes rules on "substantial transformation" of a product, added
value tax rates and changes in the customs tariff codes, according to the
official.</P>
      <P>"Substantial transformation" refers to the extent to which a product is
substantially changed after being imported for a specific manufacturing or
processing purpose.</P>
      <P>At present, the added value rate in Taiwan is 35 percent, but under the ECFA a
different rate will be applied to imported goods that are included in the early
harvest lists,  based on the characteristics of the products.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and China will also discuss imposing new regulations on imported textile
products in an effort to stop illegal transshipments of textiles which involves
the falsification of the country-of-origin information to avoid duties.</P>
      <P>During the second round of ECFA talks in March,  Chinese negotiators requested
that 700 items be put on the early harvest list, according to the official,
added in the next round of negotiations, "China is unlikely to propose that many
items."</P>
      <P>"The list will be acceptable to Taiwan, " because China has promised to make
concessions so that Taiwan's small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) would
benefit, therefore, it is likely that China would make requests that could
negatively affect SMEs, the official added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>All imports of U.S. beef tongues to be inspected: official</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The importation of beef tongues from the United States will require permission
from Taiwan and the product should be inspected batch-by-batch, an economic
official said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said beef tongues, cattle
penises, testicles and tails are not classified as offal, which is not allowed
into Taiwan according to a protocol signed with Washington last November.</P>
      <P>Therefore, the importation of the other beef parts mentioned are technically
allowed under the category of bone-in beef, which does not require special
permission and is subject only to random checks, the official said.</P>
      <P>However, the official added, Taiwan is insisting on special permission and
batch-by-batch inspection for the importation of those products because of
safety concerns among local consumers.</P>
      <P>Washington's announcement on April 16 regarding the export of U.S. beef tongues
to Taiwan was made only after it agreed to Taiwan's terms, the official said.</P>
      <P>In other words, the official said, importers will be required first to obtain a
U.S. phytosanitary certificate and health certificate before bringing beef
tongues into Taiwan, he said. Then they would have to apply for import
permission in Taiwan and agree to batch-by-batch inspection of the products by
Taiwan inspectors before the beef tongues could be put on the local market, the
official added.</P>
      <P>A health official confirmed that every case of imported U.S. beef tongues will
be opened and inspected. The first batch of the other beef parts will also be
inspected in the same way, but if they pass the checks, only 5 percent of the
cases in subsequent shipments will be inspected, the official added.</P>
      <P>According to a local beef importer, U.S. beef tongues and tails are unlikely to
see good sales because they are not that popular among local consumers, and the
same products from Australia and New Zealand cost much less.</P>
      <P>The U.S. announced Friday that all the beef parts mentioned above should come
from cattle younger than 30 months and slaughtered on or after April 1, which
would reduce the risk of mad cow disease.</P>
      <P>Last September, Taiwan lifted its ban on imports of U.S. bone-in beef, which had
been imposed out of fear of mad cow disease.</P>

      <P>A man who destroyed a patch of endangered beach grass by driving a dune buggy
across a wetlands area in Taichung County recently, may face a fine of up to
NT$250,000 (US$7,937), a Taichung police source said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The man, identified as Chen Sung-ming, was temporarily detained and questioned
several days ago after he drove a dune buggy across the Kaumei Wetlands near the
estuary of the southern bank of the Dajia River, said Lee Tsai-an, head of the
Chingshuei Police Department in Taichung County.</P>
      <P>The all terrain vehicle (ATV) damaged several hundred square meters of
endangered Guan grass (Bolboschoenus planiculmis) that was growing on the Kaumei
Wetlands, which has seven different kinds of environments and hosts many wild
animals and plants, Lee said.</P>
      <P>The Chingshuei Police Department referred the case to the Taichung County
government Sunday for penalty advice. The man could be fined up to NT$250,000
for violating the Wildlife Conservation Law, Lee added.</P>
      <P>The Guan grass, which grows naturally in the wetlands salty soil, is an
important aspect of the area's diverse ecology.</P>
      <P>According to the police, Chen had injured his leg recently before the ATV
incident, when a light plane he was flying crashed into the sea near the Dajia
River estuary on March 20.</P>
      <P>On that occasion, he was a given a ticket for violating the Law of Civil
Aviation, according to the Chingshuei Police Department.</P>

according to a financial official.</P>
      <P>Under the revised regulations, local banks will be permitted to apply to set up

      <P>However, Chinese banking institutions will only be permitted to invest in Taiwan
banks if a trade pact being negotiated by Taiwan and China allows them to do so,

      <P>After a hiatus of nearly 10 years, the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) leadership may
decide to reinstate soon the Sun Yat-sen scholarships that were previously
awarded to many of its promising young members, a party source said Sunday.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou, who is also chairman of the KMT, and the party's
secretary general King Pu-tsung may be invited soon to give the oral tests to
candidates, as both men were recipients of the scholarship and have a good
command of the English language, said Lin Yung-juei,  a KMT official  in charge
of administrative management.</P>
      <P>President Ma will meet with KMT heavyweights April 22 for discussions on the
reinstatement of the scholarship, which was established in 1960 by the KMT to
send talented young people abroad for advanced studies in different disciplines,
Lin said.</P>
      <P>The preliminarily plan is for 10 young men and women, under 40 years of age,
will be selected by the party this year to receive the Sun Yat-sen scholarships,
and NT$15 million will be allocated this year for that purpose, according to
Lin.</P>
      <P>The scholarships will be open only to candidates who have been KMT members for
more than two years, he added.</P>
      <P>Besides Ma and King, other prominent figures who were awarded the scholarships
for advanced studies overseas include Examination Yuan President John Kuan, KMT
Vice Chairman Chan Chuen-po, retired veteran diplomat  Eugene Yi-cheng Lok,
Taichung City Mayor Jason Hu, Government Information Office Minister Johnny Chi-

      <P>The first in a series of public hearings on the question of whether the death
penalty should be abolished will be held April 21 in Taipei County, the Ministry
of Justice (MOJ) said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The public hearing, which is expected to draw the participation of people on
both sides of the death penalty issue, will focus on two main questions --
whether the 44 convicts currently on death row should be executed and what
should be the government's policy on capital punishment, the ministry said in a
statement.</P>
      <P>While it is Taiwan's ultimate goal to abolish the death penalty, there is no
timetable for doing so, the ministry said. The priorities at the moment are to
forge a national consensus on the issue, reduce the use of death penalty and
give better protection to crime victims, it added.</P>
      <P>As part of the government's efforts to strengthen communication with the public,
the ministry will join with district prosecutors offices to hold four public
hearings on topics related to the death penalty.</P>
      <P>The first hearing will be held April 21 at a Lunshan Temple-owned culture hall
Banciao City, and the other three will be held later in Taichung, Kaohsiung and
Hualien, respectively.</P>
      <P>Members of the public are invited to attend the hearings to voice their views,
the ministry said.</P>
      <P>The discussions will examine factors that should be considered in evaluating
whether the death penalty should be phased out, the purpose and social
significance of such a move, the effects of correctional education, and whether
government finances and the country's image should be taken into account in
making a decision on capital punishment.</P>
      <P>Other issues to be discussed will include what complementary measures should be
adopted if death penalty will remain in place and how to improve the death
penalty-related judicial process.</P>

      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih said Sunday that he and President Ma Ying-jeou both support
rule of law and that if a referendum proposal on a trade pact with China is
presented in accordance with the law, no one would have the right to block or
oppose it.</P>
      <P>Wu said in a TV interview that the ruling Kuomintang is not opposed to a
referendum on the proposed cross-Taiwan Strait economic cooperation framework
agreement (ECFA) and that everyone should respect the right of referendum, once
the proposal adheres to the Constitution and the law.</P>
      <P>Wu's comments came days after the China Times reported that he was "not opposed
to an ECFA referendum." KMT Secretary-General King Pu-tsung also endorsed the
premier's statement, saying that if the opposition Democratic Progressive Party
insists on pushing for an ECFA referendum, "neither the KMT nor President Ma
would oppose it."</P>
      <P>The referendum issue was raised as the Mainland Affairs Council and the Ministry
of Economic Affairs were preparing to deliver documents and data on the ECFA to
the DPP Monday. The information is being given to the opposition party on Ma's
instructions  in preparation for a TV debate April 25 between him and DPP
Chairperson Tsai Ing-wen on the ECFA.</P>
      <P>The government will make all relevant documents available to the public,
according to Presidential Office spokesman Lo Chin-chiang Sunday. He also called
on the DPP to provide the president with information to support its opposition
to the proposed trade pact with China.</P>
      <P>Both sides have the right and responsibility to request and provide documents
ahead of the debate, he added.</P>
      <P>However, according to Lo, the debate will not be the beginning or the end of the
government's effort to promote the proposed trade pact with China.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, an alliance of white-collar workers in Taipei, which is opposed to
the ECFA, said Sunday that the debate should cover not only economic and trade
issues, but should also address the potential effect on politics, society and
culture.</P>
      <P>Chou Ni-an, leader of the alliance, said that currently the discussions on the
ECFA are focused on which industries would suffer and which sectors would
benefit as a result of the trade accord.</P>

recruiting economics and finance officials capable of articulating major
government policies and defending those policies in the face of opposition.</P>
      <P>The absence of such officials in Ma's economic and financial brain  trust has

botched formulation of policy in those critical areas.</P>
      <P>We look forward to seeing resourceful and eloquent economic and financial
experts join the Ma administration in the next Cabinet reshuffle, which is
widely expected after Vice Premier Eric Liluan Chu resigns, probably in May, to
run for mayor of Xinbei City.</P>

foundations and the pros and cons of major legislative proposals, as U.S.

healthcare reform initiative ahead of a congressional vote. Thanks to his full

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) under the Department of Health confirmed
Sunday that a woman who died April 14 after eating dried beancurd and preserved
oysters had a botulism infection.</P>
      <P>CDC Deputy Director Lin Ting said lab tests confirmed that the 44-year-old woman
from Miaoli County had a botulism infection, which is usually caused by a nerve
toxin produced by clostridium botulinum bacteria.</P>
      <P>Several mice were injected with the woman's blood serum and they died within 24
hours, Lin added.</P>
      <P>However, further lab tests will be required to determine what type of botulism
caused the woman's death, he said.</P>
      <P>It was also still not known whether it was the dried beancurd or the preserved
oysters which the woman and her mother-in-law ate that caused the fatal botulism
infection, Lin said.</P>
      <P>The woman's 71-year-old mother-in-law has been on intubation at Taichung
Veterans General Hospital in central Taiwan since she fell ill after eating the
beancurd and oysters. Lab tests have confirmed that she also has a botulism
infection. She has received two doses of botulismus-antitoxin that were rushed
to the hospital by the CDC and which saved her life, according to Lin.</P>
      <P>However, the daughter-in-law was not that lucky, as she was rushed to a
different hospital in Taoyuan County, northern Taiwan which was not alert enough
to seek emergency assistance from the CDC for the treatment of botulism, Lin
said.</P>
      <P>Samples of two packs of dried beancurd and a can of salted oysters that were
found in the women's home in Miaoli were retrieved by the Food and Drug
Administration for testing, but the lab reports will not be available for two
weeks, the CDC said.</P>
      <P>The two Miaoli women were the third and fourth botulism cases this year,
following a mother and daughter in Taoyuan County who were diagnosed in early
April, the CDC said. The Taoyuan mother and daughter were treated with
botulismus-antitoxin.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Taoyuan County Public Health Bureau on Friday closed operations
for two weeks at the two companies where the dried beancurd was made and ordered
that the products be pulled from the shelves of major grocery stores.</P>
      <P>However, the companies have complained of mistreatment, saying that their
products were safe and were made in line with government standards. They
complained that the two-week suspension will cost them hundreds of thousands of
New Taiwan dollars.</P>
      <P>"I hope the relevant tests will be completed soon so that my company's name can
be cleared, " said Tseng Fan-Hsiang, owner of Cheng Hsiang Foods Co.</P>
      <P>The latest incident has also resulted in declining business in Taoyuan County's
Dasi township -- the center of dried beancurd production in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Huang Chien-chia, president of Tafang Foods, a well-established manufacturer of
dried beancurd and related products in Dasi, said his store's business has
shrunk by one-third this weekend.</P>
      <P>Chiang Chiu-yun, the owner of another company known as Wan Li Hsiang which was
established in 1921, said business at her store has also been affected by the
incident, but added that her faithful customers were not at all fazed.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The father of one of the world's top-ranking golfers, Yani Tseng of Taiwan, said
Sunday his daughter is eager to gain the sponsorship of local companies.</P>
      <P>Tseng Mao-hsin made the remarks while confirming that the Huabin Group in china
has offered to sign a long-term sponsorship contract with his daughter, who
vaulted into second place in the women's world golf rankings after she won the
Kraft Nabisco Championship earlier this month.</P>
      <P>The local Chinese-language daily China Times reported Sunday that the Huabin
Group intends to sign a five-year,  US$25 million sponsorship contract with the
21-year-old Taiwanese golfer.</P>
      <P>Responding to the report, Tseng Mao-hsin said that as a Taiwanese citizen, his
daughter would prefer to collaborate with Taiwanese business groups, but
regrettably none of them have stepped forward so far.</P>
      <P>Regarding the Huabin offer, Tseng Mao-hsin said the two sides are still
discussing the details of the contract.</P>
      <P>"We are not sure whether a sponsorship contract will eventually be signed, as we
have not yet come to terms on certain details, " he said.</P>
      <P>To be honest, Tseng Mao-shin, said the Huabin Group's offer is far from
attractive because the contract will not cover Tseng Yani's travel costs to
participate in LPGA tournaments.</P>
      <P>"As a matter of fact, LPGA tours comprise the largest chunk of Yani's annual
expenses... therefore, the Huabin offer is less than attractive in real terms,"
he said.</P>
      <P>Another aspect that has to be considered is Huabin's demand that Yani Tseng
terminate all other contracts with her existing sponsors of golf clubs,
sunglasses, sportswear and relevant sports gear once she signs a deal with
Huabin, her father said.</P>
      <P>Apart from Huabin, he said, several brokerage agencies are also negotiating
sponsorship contracts with his daughter.</P>
      <P>Yani Tseng is scheduled to return to Taiwan April 25 when various sponsorship
contract issues will be further discussed, he said. Aside from soaring up the
world rankings, Yani Tseng catapulted to the top of other major lists by winning
the April 4 Kraft Nabisco Championship in Rancho Mirage, California, the first
major tournament of the season. Her US$300,000 first prize made her the leading

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan composer breathes new life into traditional music</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>04/18/10  18:59:59</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>In the musical world of Huang Chen-ming there are no limitations or boundaries.
He sees no problem combining traditional Taiwanese and Chinese music with
elements of Western rock, African music or Scottish folk songs.</P>
      <P>Wang, the founder of the Chai Found Music Workshop, has set himself the goal of
broadening the scope of traditional music and creating more opportunities for
Taiwan musicians to play all over the world.</P>
      <P>Since his return from the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, Canada earlier this
year and a tour of several United States cities, Huang thinks he has been moving
closer to this goal.</P>
      <P>His life mission is to promote traditional music, he told the Central News
Agency.</P>
      <P>"I want to create limitless possibilities for traditional music and I hope more
composers worldwide would join us," he said.</P>
      <P>Since he established the music workshop 19 years ago, Huang has brought together
a group of musicians that include pipa player Lin Hui-Kuan and di player Wu
Chung-Hsien.</P>
      <P>As the group's artistic director and composer, Huang uses traditional Chinese
instruments as a central thematic element and has created a unique musical space
that not only facilitates the performance of Sizhu music -- Chinese chamber
music -- but also provides  other composers  with an inspirational  platform for
experimentation.</P>
      <P>The group preserves traditional elements by fully exploiting the distinctive
sounds of Eastern instruments, while also introducing light innovation into the
genre of folk and world music. The aim is to create a groundbreaking expression
of the diversity, vitality and richness of Taiwanese contemporary music,
according to Huang.</P>
      <P>He thinks that traditional music could encompass all kinds of experimentation.
One of his latest concepts is that music should not only be heard, but also be
seen.</P>
      <P>With this in mind, he plans to incorporate tai-chi into his group's musical
performances.</P>
      <P>"All of our musicians will begin to learn tai-chi in May so that they can
express that art form through music and with their bodies," he said.</P>
      <P>As part of his efforts to expand the expression of traditional music, Huang last
year held a composers' competition based on the theme of the ancient Chinese
"five movements" philosophy which describes the interactions and relationships
among five elements -- wood, water, earth, fire and metal.</P>
      <P>The competition attracted many composers from the West and the East, eight of
whom were chosen to present their works at a concert.</P>
      <P>Huang is holding a similar competition this year, this time under the theme of
yin-yang, which describes the interconnectedness and interdependency of seeming
polar forces in the natural world.</P>
      <P>"In this competition, we could see quite different and very creative works from
Western and Eastern composers, which could also open another window for the
enrichment of traditional music," Huang said.</P>
      <P>The winning compositions will be presented at a concert in October, he added.</P>
      <P>Over the years, Huang 's group has been invited to several international
festivals such as the Barcelona Arts Festival in Spain in 1992, the Costa Rica
Culture Festival in 1998, the Hoergaenge Contemporary Music Festival in Austria
in 2000, the Cologne Music Festival in Germany 2001,  the Huddersfield
Contemporary Music Festival in England in 2004; and the Festival Dimension in
Seoul, Korea in 2009.</P>
      <P>"This year, we will have more opportunities to go abroad, to connect with other
countries, including France where we will perform with musicians in Paris at the
end of the year" Huang said.</P>
      <P>"But this is also the year for training for a great future, " he added. CNA

      <P>The third round of talks between Taiwan and China later this month on a proposed
trade pact is expected to produce a clear draft of an early harvest list of
products and services for tariff concessions, an economics official said Sunday.</P>
      <P>During the second round of technical talks, Taiwan and China reached consensus
on several aspects of the proposed Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement
(ECFA), the official added.</P>
      <P>Negotiations on financial services between the two sides will be held ahead of
the third round of ECFA talks, the official said.</P>
      <P>A panel of experts, commissioned by the Ministry of Finance's Department of
Customs Administration, has been in consultation with their Chinese counterparts
on the details  of place-of-origin regulations for imported products, he noted.</P>
      <P>The issue includes rules on "substantial transformation" of a product, added
value tax rates and changes in the customs tariff codes, according to the
official.</P>
      <P>"Substantial transformation" refers to the extent to which a product is
substantially changed after being imported for a specific manufacturing or
processing purpose.</P>
      <P>At present, the added value rate in Taiwan is 35 percent, but under the ECFA a
different rate will be applied to imported goods that are included in the early
harvest lists,  based on the characteristics of the products.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and China will also discuss imposing new regulations on imported textile
products in an effort to stop illegal transshipments of textiles which involves
the falsification of the country-of-origin information to avoid duties.</P>
      <P>During the second round of ECFA talks in March,  Chinese negotiators requested
that 700 items be put on the early harvest list, according to the official,
added in the next round of negotiations, "China is unlikely to propose that many
items."</P>
      <P>"The list will be acceptable to Taiwan, " because China has promised to make
concessions so that Taiwan's small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) would
benefit, therefore, it is likely that China would make requests that could
negatively affect SMEs, the official added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>All imports of U.S. beef tongues to be inspected: official</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The importation of beef tongues from the United States will require permission
from Taiwan and the product should be inspected batch-by-batch, an economic
official said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said beef tongues, cattle
penises, testicles and tails are not classified as offal, which is not allowed
into Taiwan according to a protocol signed with Washington last November.</P>
      <P>Therefore, the importation of the other beef parts mentioned are technically
allowed under the category of bone-in beef, which does not require special
permission and is subject only to random checks, the official said.</P>
      <P>However, the official added, Taiwan is insisting on special permission and
batch-by-batch inspection for the importation of those products because of
safety concerns among local consumers.</P>
      <P>Washington's announcement on April 16 regarding the export of U.S. beef tongues
to Taiwan was made only after it agreed to Taiwan's terms, the official said.</P>
      <P>In other words, the official said, importers will be required first to obtain a
U.S. phytosanitary certificate and health certificate before bringing beef
tongues into Taiwan, he said. Then they would have to apply for import
permission in Taiwan and agree to batch-by-batch inspection of the products by
Taiwan inspectors before the beef tongues could be put on the local market, the
official added.</P>
      <P>A health official confirmed that every case of imported U.S. beef tongues will
be opened and inspected. The first batch of the other beef parts will also be
inspected in the same way, but if they pass the checks, only 5 percent of the
cases in subsequent shipments will be inspected, the official added.</P>
      <P>According to a local beef importer, U.S. beef tongues and tails are unlikely to
see good sales because they are not that popular among local consumers, and the
same products from Australia and New Zealand cost much less.</P>
      <P>The U.S. announced Friday that all the beef parts mentioned above should come
from cattle younger than 30 months and slaughtered on or after April 1, which
would reduce the risk of mad cow disease.</P>
      <P>Last September, Taiwan lifted its ban on imports of U.S. bone-in beef, which had
been imposed out of fear of mad cow disease.</P>

      <P>A man who destroyed a patch of endangered beach grass by driving a dune buggy
across a wetlands area in Taichung County recently, may face a fine of up to
NT$250,000 (US$7,937), a Taichung police source said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The man, identified as Chen Sung-ming, was temporarily detained and questioned
several days ago after he drove a dune buggy across the Kaumei Wetlands near the
estuary of the southern bank of the Dajia River, said Lee Tsai-an, head of the
Chingshuei Police Department in Taichung County.</P>
      <P>The all terrain vehicle (ATV) damaged several hundred square meters of
endangered Guan grass (Bolboschoenus planiculmis) that was growing on the Kaumei
Wetlands, which has seven different kinds of environments and hosts many wild
animals and plants, Lee said.</P>
      <P>The Chingshuei Police Department referred the case to the Taichung County
government Sunday for penalty advice. The man could be fined up to NT$250,000
for violating the Wildlife Conservation Law, Lee added.</P>
      <P>The Guan grass, which grows naturally in the wetlands salty soil, is an
important aspect of the area's diverse ecology.</P>
      <P>According to the police, Chen had injured his leg recently before the ATV
incident, when a light plane he was flying crashed into the sea near the Dajia
River estuary on March 20.</P>
      <P>On that occasion, he was a given a ticket for violating the Law of Civil
Aviation, according to the Chingshuei Police Department.</P>

      <P>After a hiatus of nearly 10 years, the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) leadership may
decide to reinstate soon the Sun Yat-sen scholarships that were previously
awarded to many of its promising young members, a party source said Sunday.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou, who is also chairman of the KMT, and the party's
secretary general King Pu-tsung may be invited soon to give the oral tests to
candidates, as both men were recipients of the scholarship and have a good
command of the English language, said Lin Yung-juei,  a KMT official  in charge
of administrative management.</P>
      <P>President Ma will meet with KMT heavyweights April 22 for discussions on the
reinstatement of the scholarship, which was established in 1960 by the KMT to
send talented young people abroad for advanced studies in different disciplines,
Lin said.</P>
      <P>The preliminarily plan is for 10 young men and women, under 40 years of age,
will be selected by the party this year to receive the Sun Yat-sen scholarships,
and NT$15 million will be allocated this year for that purpose, according to
Lin.</P>
      <P>The scholarships will be open only to candidates who have been KMT members for
more than two years, he added.</P>
      <P>Besides Ma and King, other prominent figures who were awarded the scholarships
for advanced studies overseas include Examination Yuan President John Kuan, KMT

      <P>The first in a series of public hearings on the question of whether the death
penalty should be abolished will be held April 21 in Taipei County, the Ministry
of Justice (MOJ) said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The public hearing, which is expected to draw the participation of people on
both sides of the death penalty issue, will focus on two main questions --
whether the 44 convicts currently on death row should be executed and what
should be the government's policy on capital punishment, the ministry said in a
statement.</P>
      <P>While it is Taiwan's ultimate goal to abolish the death penalty, there is no
timetable for doing so, the ministry said. The priorities at the moment are to
forge a national consensus on the issue, reduce the use of death penalty and
give better protection to crime victims, it added.</P>
      <P>As part of the government's efforts to strengthen communication with the public,
the ministry will join with district prosecutors offices to hold four public
hearings on topics related to the death penalty.</P>
      <P>The first hearing will be held April 21 at a Lunshan Temple-owned culture hall
Banciao City, and the other three will be held later in Taichung, Kaohsiung and
Hualien, respectively.</P>
      <P>Members of the public are invited to attend the hearings to voice their views,
the ministry said.</P>
      <P>The discussions will examine factors that should be considered in evaluating
whether the death penalty should be phased out, the purpose and social
significance of such a move, the effects of correctional education, and whether
government finances and the country's image should be taken into account in
making a decision on capital punishment.</P>
      <P>Other issues to be discussed will include what complementary measures should be
adopted if death penalty will remain in place and how to improve the death
penalty-related judicial process.</P>

      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih said Sunday that he and President Ma Ying-jeou both support
rule of law and that if a referendum proposal on a trade pact with China is
presented in accordance with the law, no one would have the right to block or
oppose it.</P>
      <P>Wu said in a TV interview that the ruling Kuomintang is not opposed to a
referendum on the proposed cross-Taiwan Strait economic cooperation framework
agreement (ECFA) and that everyone should respect the right of referendum, once
the proposal adheres to the Constitution and the law.</P>
      <P>Wu's comments came days after the China Times reported that he was "not opposed
to an ECFA referendum." KMT Secretary-General King Pu-tsung also endorsed the
premier's statement, saying that if the opposition Democratic Progressive Party
insists on pushing for an ECFA referendum, "neither the KMT nor President Ma
would oppose it."</P>
      <P>The referendum issue was raised as the Mainland Affairs Council and the Ministry
of Economic Affairs were preparing to deliver documents and data on the ECFA to
the DPP Monday. The information is being given to the opposition party on Ma's
instructions  in preparation for a TV debate April 25 between him and DPP
Chairperson Tsai Ing-wen on the ECFA.</P>
      <P>The government will make all relevant documents available to the public,
according to Presidential Office spokesman Lo Chin-chiang Sunday. He also called
on the DPP to provide the president with information to support its opposition
to the proposed trade pact with China.</P>
      <P>Both sides have the right and responsibility to request and provide documents
ahead of the debate, he added.</P>
      <P>However, according to Lo, the debate will not be the beginning or the end of the
government's effort to promote the proposed trade pact with China.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, an alliance of white-collar workers in Taipei, which is opposed to
the ECFA, said Sunday that the debate should cover not only economic and trade
issues, but should also address the potential effect on politics, society and
culture.</P>
      <P>Chou Ni-an, leader of the alliance, said that currently the discussions on the
ECFA are focused on which industries would suffer and which sectors would

    <TEXT>
      <P>After learning of a mother who killed herself and her teenage daughter by
burning charcoal indoors, Minister of the Interior Jiang Yi-huah said Monday
that the ministry will take measures to strengthen its suicide prevention
mechanism.</P>
      <P>The National Police Agency will also be told to train police officers to be
alert when receiving reports of similar cases, after the 13 year-old victim had
attempted to find help upon learning her mother wanted to kill them both, Jiang
said.</P>
      <P>In response to media inquiries, Jiang admitted there were defects in the
existing suicide prevention reporting system.</P>
      <P>The girl, identified only by her surname Tsao, and her mother were both found
dead at their home in Taichung County's Taiping City April 17, with police
saying they had killed themselves by burning charcoal.</P>
      <P>The tragedy was publicized by a local newspaper, the United Daily News, on its
front page Monday, saying that despite the girl having attempted to find help at
school, her mother was still able to take the girl home and carry out her
suicide plan.</P>
      <P>The girl left two letters for classmates and one thank-you note for her teacher
to bid farewell, the report said.</P>
      <P>Citing the director of student affairs -- surnamed Chen -- at a private boarding
school in Nantou County where Tsao was enrolled, the report said: "I begged the
mother to leave the child here, but was rejected."</P>
      <P>"After learning of the death of the mother and girl, the image of the child, who
could not stop weeping out of fear for her mother's anger, kept emerging in my
head," Chen said.</P>
      <P>According to the report, Tsao told the school on April 1 of her mother's plan to
commit suicide during the Tomb Sweeping Day holiday April 3-5. On that same day,
Tsao's mother picked the girl up from school despite Chen's request that Tsao
stay with her.</P>
      <P>Chen said she had informed the police and county social workers of the alleged
suicide attempt. But "both of them failed to show up" before the mother and
daughter left, she said.</P>
      <P>"Despite the fact I tried not to let her go, I could only watch them leave,"
Chen said.</P>
      <P>The report said that Nantou County social workers transferred the case to their
counterparts in Taichung County where the mother lived, and that Taichung County
police and social workers did not handle the case until April 6, when they
visited the mother's home in Taiping City but found that no one answered the
door.</P>
      <P>After that, police and social workers visited the house three days in a row but
found no one until April 17, when police broke in and discovered the mother and
daughter had been dead for days, the report said.</P>
      <P>"It was a serious mistake by social working units, " the daily cited Peng Huai-
chen, an assistant professor at Tunghai University's Department of Social Work,
as saying.</P>
      <P>Peng blamed social workers' lack of alertness for the tragedy, saying they
shouldn't give up when they fail to reach someone involved in such a case.</P>

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwanese people, who were first allowed to purchase the Chinese yuan only
months ago, have been on a shopping spree for the currency in anticipation of an
appreciation this year.</P>
      <P>The new "fad of renminbi shopping" has caused shortages of the Chinese yuan
banknotes in Taiwan, a development which in turn led local banks to become
reluctant to sell the renminbi, with some even implementing a "buying only, no
selling" strategy.</P>
      <P>However, a banker reminds people wishing to profit from the price differences
that "hoarding" of the Chinese yuan will not necessarily yield any profits if
the yuan appreciates no higher than 5.1 percent.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts on the issue carried in Monday's China Times and
United Daily News.</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>A Mega Bank official said that with its store of Chinese yuan decreasing
drastically as a result of rising demand for the currency in Taiwan, the bank
was forced to acquire yuan from Bank of America and HSBC based in Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>The anticipation of the yuan's rise was so strong that even HSBC stopped
offering quotes on the currency.</P>
      <P>"Over the past month, we have either sourced renminbi cash at higher prices or
obtained none at all," the Mega banker said.</P>
      <P>That is why Mega Bank has implemented a "buying only, no selling" measure in all
its branches islandwide, the banker said, except for at Kaohsiung International
Airport, where the Chinese yuan is still available for exchange. (April 19,
2010).</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>"Hoarding" renminbi will not necessarily be profitable for Taiwanese people.</P>
      <P>The recent visit to Beijing by U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner has
stirred up forex speculators' expectations of the Chinese yuan's imminent
appreciation. China's Vice Minister of Commerce Zhong Shan, however, said last
week that China and the U.S. have reached a preliminary agreement that the value
of the yuan will not be adjusted and the currency will remain stable in both
China's forex exchange market and its foreign trade market.</P>
      <P>Chinese President Hu Jintao has also declared that "the renminbi exchange reform
will not begin because of any outside pressure."</P>
      <P>China's export traders, however, speculated that the renminbi will rise between
2-3 percent this year, despite the government's denial.</P>
      <P>Liu Enyuan, a vice president at Panpan Security Industries, said the renminbi's
appreciation is irreversible, given the fact that costs for all raw materials
have risen.</P>
      <P>"Even if the renminbi does not rise in a lump sum shortly, the currency is
forecast to grow stronger gradually, " Liu said. (April 19, 2010).</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Secretary-General  King  Pu-tsung  told Singapore-based  Lianhe  Zaobao  that
President  Ma Ying-jeou's disapproval rating declined by 18 percent in the KMT's
latest survey, which he branded as a positive development.</P>
      <P>However, we have to point out that according to another survey conducted by the
Global Views Monthly, Ma's approval rating remained at about 30 percent,
compared to the 60 percent polled who disapprove of his performance.</P>
      <P>So at best, Ma is still on the public's watch list.</P>
      <P>How could he fall from grace with the people so rapidly?</P>
      <P>Whether Ma will admit it or not, his ruling team doesn't have any central goals
for leading the country.</P>
      <P>Shortly after taking office, the president gathered a group of scholars and
experts with an eye to streamlining the country's</P>
      <P>taxation system, only to see their efforts fall flat because Ma's ruling team
was more than willing to overrule their suggestions for political reasons.</P>
      <P>In an attempt to outbid the opposition party, the business income tax provided
in the government's industrial innovation bill was cut, by the ruling team
itself, from 20 percent to 17 percent.</P>
      <P>There is no reason to cut it except to woo voters.</P>
      <P>The bill was crafted to replace two expired statutes that promoted investment in
and the upgrading of industry, and is supposed to eliminate tax breaks included
in its forerunners.</P>
      <P>However, it not only renews this outdated practice but expands it to cover
traditional economic sectors and small- and medium-sized enterprises, even
though they have nothing to do with innovation.</P>
      <P>Another example is the establishment of five municipalities, which includes two
more than President Ma's initial plan and run contrary to his goal of balancing
the development of northern, central and southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>If the only thing the head of the state is concerned about is how to win
elections in the newly formed municipalities, rather than a long-range vision
for the country, the country's democracy will not be able to develop healthily.</P>
      <P>A leader who is too accommodating to voters at the cost of his policies can
hardly earn people's respect. (April 19, 2010)</P>

    <HEADLINE>Talk of the day -- New military complex taking shape</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>04/19/10  14:02:57
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A special military district will take shape in the Taipei suburb of Dazhe next
year when the Ministry of National Defense (MND) and the Air Force General
Headquarters move into new buildings in the area next year.</P>
      <P>The ministry reportedly has formed a task force to oversee relevant construction
projects to ensure they are completed in time for inauguration next October as
part of the country's centenary celebrations.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the ministry has also completed a review of its 50-plus barracks in
metropolitan Taipei and has tentatively decided to release more than 200
hectares of land under its control for redevelopment.</P>
      <P>In line with the government's  "lean  and mean"  military streamlining project,
the MND is scheduled to disband its military forces entertainment corps in 2014
as part of its efforts to meet the goal of trimming the number of armed forces
to 215,000.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from local media coverage of the topic: China Times:</P>
      <P>Construction of the new MND building began in 2005 and was originally scheduled
for completion in 2008, but completion was delayed due to a redesign of its
interior to cope with new demand arising from military restructuring.</P>
      <P>The budget was also increased from NT$13.3 billion to more than NT$15 billion
(US$476.19 million) because of the redesign.</P>
      <P>Defense Minister Kao Hua-chu has been pushing for acceleration of construction
in order to finalize the ministry's relocation next year in time for the
country's centenary celebrations.</P>
      <P>The new MND headquarters is being built on the site of the old National Defense
University and will also house the new Air Force headquarters.</P>
      <P>The new MND and Air Force headquarters, and the adjacent Navy headquarters, will
form a new special military complex. Moreover, the new MND building is close to
the tightly guarded Heng Shan Military Command Center, an emergency command
center.</P>
      <P>The new location will allow for seamless integration of peacetime and wartime
operations, according to military sources.</P>
      <P>According to the sources, the new MND building can withstand a magnitude-7
earthquake and Chinese EMP (electromagnetic  pulse) attacks. Its blastproofing
and bombproofing capacity is on par with that of the U.S. Pentagon, the sources
said.</P>
      <P>The complex will have two large helipads. As the new MND headquarters has a
mountain at its back, it is better protected from missile and fighter jet
attacks, the sources went on, adding that anti-air attack missiles and ground
troops will be deployed at the complex to cope with possible enemy attacks.
(April 19, 2010). Commercial Times:</P>
      <P>The 200 hectares of land to be released by the military for redevelopment will
include a 185-hectare plot that will be left vacant following the downsizing of
the military's No. 202 artillery and ammunition factory in Nangang district, and
a 7-hectare plot to be vacated following the relocation of the Air Force
headquarters next year.</P>
      <P>The Air Force headquarters plot will be most lucrative, as it sits on the city's
tree-lined Renai Road, which boasts many luxury houses and beautiful scenery.</P>
      <P>The plot, worth NT$16.2 billion in terms of officially assessed price, has been
listed by the Executive Yuan as one of the areas to be subject to rejuvenation
and redevelopment.</P>
      <P>Local construction companies cannot wait to bid for cooperation with the
military to develop the plot, as they believe that housing built in the area
will fetch exorbitant prices. (April 19, 2010).</P>

    <HEADLINE>Strict controls on U.S. beef imports: economics minister</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 19 (CNA)
04/19/10  14:13:01

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan will adopt strict measures based on the existing law to ensure that
imports of U.S. beef products such as tongues and testicles are safe for
consumption, Minister of Economic Affairs Shih Yen-shiang said Monday.</P>
      <P>In response to lawmakers' questions at the Legislative Yuan, Shih said the
measures will be implemented based on the principles of "three controls and five
certifications."</P>
      <P>The measures set controls on beef imports at the source, at borders and in
markets, while the five certifications refer to verifying certification
documents, checking that shipments are marked with detailed product information,
opening a high percentage of cartons of imported beef to check the product,
conducting food safety tests and being able to get information on suspected
problem products immediately.</P>
      <P>Asked about the U.S. government's announcement that beef exports to Taiwan will
include tongues, testicles and tails, Shih cited Department of Health data as
explaining that these products are not categorized as "internal organs" that are
not allowed to be exported to Taiwan according to a Taiwan-U.S. protocol signed
last year.</P>
      <P>The Bureau of Foreign Trade will decide whether or not to allow the import of
such U.S. beef products based on the existing standard, Shih said.</P>
      <P>The U.S. Department of Agriculture announced Aril 16 that exports of beef
products to Taiwan will include bone-in meat, hanging tenders, tongues, penises,
testicles, tails, tendons, and diaphragms derived from cattle less than 30
months of age slaughtered on or after April 1.</P>
      <P>The beef parts are technically allowed to be exported into Taiwan under the
category of bone-in beef, which does not require special permission and is
subject only to random checks, according to ministry officials.</P>
      <P>Legislator  Ting Shou-chung of the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) suggested that the
government take immediate action to prohibit the beef parts from entering Taiwan
to prevent public outrage.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's agreement last year to lift its ban on U.S. bone-in beef and certain
other beef products, including ground beef and offal, sparked a huge public
outcry.</P>
      <P>The ban was imposed in 2003 due to fears of bovine spongiform encephalopathy
(BSE), or mad cow disease.</P>
      <P>Under public pressure,  the KMT-controlled Legislative Yuan amended the Act
Governing Good Sanitation Jan. 5 to deny access to Taiwan of beef products --
including ground beef, offal and other beef parts such as skulls, brains, eyes
and spines -- from countries with documented BSE cases over the past decades.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CBC advises banks to acquire renminbi directly from China</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Central Bank of the Republic of China (CBC) advised the two major foreign
banks in Taiwan that are authorized  suppliers of Chinese currency to acquire
banknotes directly from China to beef up their supplies, a CBC official said
Monday.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese people, who were first allowed to purchase the Chinese yuan only
months ago, have been snapping up the Chinese currency in anticipation of an
appreciation this year.</P>
      <P>The "renminbi shopping fad" has caused shortages of Chinese yuan banknotes in
Taiwan, a development that prompted local banks to become reluctant to sell the
currency renminbi, with some even implementing a "buying only, no selling"
strategy.</P>
      <P>Fielding questions at the Legislative Yuan, CBC Deputy Governor Chou A-ting
said renminbi  supplies  in Taiwan  had declined substantially over the past two
weeks.</P>
      <P>The amount of Chinese banknotes made available by HSBC and Bank of America in
Asia has dropped noticeably over the past several weeks, and their acquisition
of renminbi from financial markets around Asia has diminished by half, Chou
said.</P>
      <P>Chou made the remarks in response to questions from ruling Kuomintang Legislator
Lai Shyh-bao, who inquired about the New Taiwan dollar-yuan exchange rate and
limits on how much Chinese currency Taiwan citizens are allowed to buy from
banks.</P>
      <P>Chou said the NT dollar-yuan exchange rate is about 4.8: 1 and that people are
allowed to purchase 20,000 yuan per transaction from local banks.</P>
      <P>Lai suggested people could just go to the bank several times a day and acquire
as much Chinese as they wished.</P>
      <P>"People are hoarding the yuan," Lai told Chou.</P>
      <P>A Mega Bank official said earlier that with its store of Chinese yuan decreasing
drastically as a result of rising demand, the bank was forced to acquire yuan
from branches of HSBC and Bank of America based in Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>The anticipation of the yuan's rise was so strong that HSBC even stopped
offering quotes on the currency.</P>
      <P>"Over the past month, we have either sourced renminbi cash at higher prices or
obtained none at all," the Mega banker said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Economic Daily News: Issues to be clarified by party head debate</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>04/19/10  15:34:23
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou and opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
Chairperson Tsai Ying-wen are slated to have a debate April 25 on whether the
country should conclude  an economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA)
trade pact with China.</P>
      <P>Although the debate will neither change Ma's determination to clinch the pact
nor stop Tsai from going all out to stop it, we still hope it will clarify
certain issues surrounding the ECFA and will not simply be a case of trading
criticisms.</P>
      <P>Given the rise of China and the rapid economic integration in Southeast Asia,
Taiwan must adjust its economic development policy to accommodate this trend.</P>
      <P>Ma has opted to clinch the ECFA with China to break the bottleneck Taiwan faces,
but this has nothing to do with Ma's personal political preference, so the DPP
should not brand his option as "a plot to betray Taiwan" or to "knit Taiwan
together with China."</P>
      <P>On the other hand, the ruling party should not describe the DPP's opposition to
the pact as trying to seclude the island further from international society.</P>
      <P>Ma has characterized the ECFA as the first step toward a free trade pact with
China.</P>
      <P>In theory, a free trade pact will promote the efficient use of resources, but in
reality, the process of economic integration will come at a price for various
industries.</P>
      <P>The debate should disclose the extent of the pact's coverage and the timetable
for it to evolve into a full free trade pact so the public can estimate its
positive and negative effects on individual industries.</P>
      <P>The government should also reveal the complementary measures it will adopt to
ensure that the ECFA realizes its intended purposes and that its benefits will
be shared by the public.</P>
      <P>On behalf of the DPP, Tsai should tell the people how the DPP thinks the country
should enhance its international profile, promote ties with China, strengthen
its competitiveness and improve the welfare of the general public in the absence
of such a pact.</P>
      <P>Whether the debate will degenerate into a war of words, or become an actual
dialogue between the ruling and opposition leaders, depends greatly on the
participants' wisdom and vision. (April 19, 2010)</P>

    <HEADLINE>Vice premier promotes public transit to cut carbon emissions</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 19 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Instead of imposing a carbon tax to cut carbon emissions, the government should
put greater emphasis on improving the energy efficiency of vehicles and
encouraging the use of public transportation, Vice Premier Eric Liluan Chu said
Monday.</P>
      <P>In an interview with a local cable TV station, the vice premier, who heads a
carbon emissions reduction committee under the Executive Yuan, said a carbon tax
is one option to curb the consumption of fossil fuels, but the government's
overall strategy remains the most important factor in the effort.</P>
      <P>"Limiting the emissions of vehicles, encouraging the use of electric vehicles,
enhancing the efficiency of public transportation, and extending rapid transit
systems" would be more effective than imposing carbon taxes or congestion
pricing, according to Chu.</P>
      <P>The government  is also pushing 10 other carbon reduction measures, Chu said,
that focus in part on the development of clean and renewable energy and carbon-
reduction technologies, and the spread of green buildings, green factories and
green communities.</P>
      <P>Saving energy is part of modern ethics and should be a habit instilled in
students at school so they "can serve as energy-saving inspectors at home," the
vice premier added.</P>
      <P>Rapid transit systems are considered highly effective in cutting carbon
emissions, but Chu said the pace of infrastructure development has been too
slow, including in Taipei, where to date the MRT system covers 92.9 kilometers
and serves 1.38 million passengers daily.</P>
      <P>The system will cover 120 km when it is completed in 2015.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan is not a signatory of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol on Climate Change,
it has promised to cut its carbon emissions to the level of 2008 by between 2016
and 2020, and to 50 percent of the level of emissions seen in 2000 by 2050.</P>
      <P>The government formed a committee led by Chu on Dec. 28, 2009 to come up with
strategies to achieve the goals.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chu, who is considered the ruling Kuomintang's likely nominee in the
Xinbei City mayoral race in late 2010, said in the interview that he was not
certain when he will be formally tapped by the party as its candidate in the
race.</P>
      <P>"I will concentrate my energy on my job at the Executive Yuan before I am
nominated and will do my best to win the election after being nominated," Chu
said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Commercial Times: Investment promotion strategy needs revamp</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>04/19/10  17:40:40
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Executive Yuan recently formed a special task force to help remove
investment  barriers  and boost employment.  We welcome government action to
promote private investment.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, we should remind the government that a conventional technology-
centered investment strategy won't be enough to resolve Taiwan's unemployment
plight.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's private investment has steadily declined in recent years, but the
amount still ranges between NT$1.6 trillion and NT$2 trillion per year, higher
than the NT$1 trillion to NT$1.7 trillion per year recorded in the 1990s.</P>
      <P>Despite the relatively high level of investment,  Taiwan's unemployment rate
regularly exceeded 4 percent even before the 2008-2009 global financial crisis,
far higher than the 1990s average of 2 percent.</P>
      <P>Why was limited private investment in the past been able to create jobs to help
keep unemployment at bay? And why has the higher investment seen in recent years
been unable to drive down the jobless rate?</P>
      <P>A major reason is that the biggest portion of private investment has been pumped
into the semiconductor, flat panel display and other electronics industries.</P>
      <P>It is widely known that these capital- and technology-intensive industries
create few jobs. According to a 2006 industrial census, every NT$100 million
invested in the high-tech sector created only 6.4 jobs, compared to 16 jobs that
the same amount of investment could create in non-electronics or high-tech
sectors.</P>
      <P>These figures indicate that the government should not indulge in promoting large
investment projects in the high-tech sector. It should focus instead on
stimulating investment in conventional manufacturing sectors,  services,  and
small-  and medium-sized enterprises, which have been shown to be more effective
in generating new jobs. (April 19, 2010).</P>

    <HEADLINE>Groups launch campaign to herald new era of reading</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Delegates of 100-odd Taiwanese non-profit organizations (NPO) gathered Monday to
declare the establishment of the Taiwan NPO Reading Alliance, to herald a new
era of reading in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The delegates, led by the alliance's convener, Peter Mau-hsiu Yang, an associate
professor of children's literature at National Taitung University, announced a
"reading declaration" authored by writer Chien Chen.</P>
      <P>According to the declaration, reading is the bedrock of a civil society. Reading
enriches people's imagination, broadens their views and spurs their courage, it
says.</P>
      <P>In line with the purposes of the alliance's establishment, the members will
share resources and render support to each other to help build reading  habits
and facilitate  the alliance's  further development, the declaration says.</P>
      <P>Addressing the gathering, Education Minister Wu Ching-chi said he sees new hope
for the country with Taiwan's NPOs stepping forward to promote reading.</P>
      <P>He said reading is not an exclusive right reserved only for students. "Parents
and adults should also read," he noted.</P>
      <P>"People who read can see the whole world. Through reading, a man can see higher
and farther, as if he is standing on the shoulders of a giant," Wu said.</P>
      <P>Also speaking on the occasion, Lonnie Lin, a veteran NPO organizer, quoted a
2007 survey conducted by the Global View magazine as finding that the Taiwanese
spend an average of 16.94 hours per week watching television and 7.41 hours on
the Internet, but only 2.72 hours reading.</P>
      <P>This means that the public spend less than 23 minutes a day reading, Lin said,
adding that over half of Taiwan's adults are not in the habit of reading.</P>
      <P>According to another survey,  only 24 percent of Taiwan's 10-year-olds read for
fun every day, a rate that was the lowest of its kind in a survey of 45
countries.</P>
      <P>Noting that parents' attitudes toward reading have a direct impact on their
children, Lin suggested that the alliance should regularly organize a series of
activities every year to bolster reading habits in Taiwan.</P>

      <P>Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin and Legislator Huang Chao-shun of the ruling
Kuomintang (KMT) have beaten their rivals in public opinion surveys as to who
should represent the party to run in the year-end elections for mayor of Taipei
and Kaohsiung, respectively, KMT spokesman Su Jun-pin said Monday.</P>
      <P>In Tainan City, two potential contenders -- former KMT lawmakers Lee Chuan-chiao
and Kuo Tien-Tsai -- are within the statistical margin of error and either of
them could emerge as the KMT's candidate in the mayoral race there, Su cited the
results of another poll conducted by the KMT as saying.</P>
      <P>The KMT held three opinion polls last week to gauge support for potential
contenders seeking to run for the Taipei, Kaohsiung and Tainan mayoral seats.</P>
      <P>As incumbent Taichung Mayor Jason Hu and Vice Premier Eric Liluan Chu are likely
to be directly drafted by the KMT for the elections in Taichung City and Xinbei
City, the KMT did not hold polls in those two cities.</P>
      <P>Su said that KMT Secretary-General King Pu-tsung informed the potential
contenders of the results of the polls but that the details will not be released
to the public.</P>
      <P>The survey results will be used by the party as references in its nominee
selection procedure for candidates in the five special municipalities -- Taipei
City, Xinbei City, Taichung City, Tainan City and Kaohsiung City -- in the Nov.
27 elections.</P>
      <P>After the polls, KMT headquarters will coordinate among those party members who
enjoy similar amounts of public support, in an effort to ensure that the best
candidate is selected, according to Su.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Imports of U.S. beef offal allowed if no internal organs included</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>After a local beef importer applied to import 453 kilograms of U.S. beef offal
on April 15, health authorities said Monday that the applications will be
approved as long as high-risk internal organs are not included.</P>
      <P>It was the first application for importing U.S. beef offal since last November,
according to the Web site of the Bureau of Foreign Trade under the Ministry of
Economic Affairs (MOEA).</P>
      <P>To help ease any lingering public doubt about U.S. beef products, the Department
of Health (DOH) , the MOEA and the Council of Agriculture (COA) held a joint
press conference earlier Monday to explain the existing standards.</P>
      <P>Six types of beef offal such as beef tongues, penises, testicles, tails, tendons
and skirt (diaphragm) are not classified as internal organs, so imports of those
non-high-risk beef products will be accepted, they said.</P>
      <P>The foreign trade bureau's Web site, however, does not provide details of beef
offal products that the local business applied to import.</P>
      <P>Legislators from the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) argued that
the beef tongues and penises should be classified as internal organs, which
would make them illegal to import.</P>
      <P>The DOH said it decided last May that beef tongues are not classified as
internal organs -- unlike thoracic, abdominal, and pelvic organs, which are not
allowed into Taiwan under a protocol signed with Washington last October.</P>
      <P>However, as the public appears to have doubts about beef tongues, imports
require special permission and must also pass batch-by-batch inspection, DOH
Deputy Minister Hsiao Mei-ling said.</P>
      <P>Hsu Tien-lai, director general of the Bureau of Animal and Plant Health
Inspection and Quarantine under the COA, said that high- risk circumvallate
papillae, toward the base of the tongue, are required to be removed from beef
tongues before entering Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The first batch of the other beef parts will also be inspected batch- by-batch,
but if they pass the checks, only 5 percent of the cases in subsequent shipments
will be inspected, officials said.</P>
      <P>According to MOEA statistics, over 210,000 kg of U.S. bone-in beef products have
been imported since last November.</P>
      <P>The U.S. announced last Friday that exports of beef products to Taiwan will
include bone-in meat, hanging tenders, tongues, penises, testicles, tails,
tendons and diaphragms from cattle younger than 30 months and slaughtered on or
after April 1, seen as having a lower risk of carrying mad cow disease.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taichung Mayor Jason Hu instructed city officials and social workers Monday to
be more active in handling reports of suicide attempts and to try harder to
prevent tragedies.</P>
      <P>Hu issued the directive after learning about a mother who took her own life and
the life of her 13-year-old daughter by burning charcoal indoors, even though
the daughter had attempted to find help upon learning that her mother wanted to
kill them both.</P>
      <P>The victims -- identified only by the surname Tsao -- lived in Taichung County's
Taiping City, although their household registration was in Taichung City,
central Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The girl, who studied at a private boarding school in Nantou County, told
teachers April 1 that her mother was preparing to commit suicide by burning
charcoal.</P>
      <P>Although the school attempted the following day to keep the girl at school, and
contacted both the police and social workers to seek their assistance. Neither
the police nor the social workers bothered to attend, however, and the school
was forced to hand over the girl to her mother. Afterward, even when the child
did not show up at school, social workers of both Nantou County and Taichung
County made no contact with them until April 17, when police discovered their
bodies at their home in Taiping City.</P>
      <P>Hu expressed his regret and remorse, and questioned why the social workers and
policemen responsible for the case did not break into the victims' home much
sooner, since they were well aware of the mother's intention to commit suicide.</P>
      <P>"A strong hand must be used in handling matters regarding human lives, " Hu
said, criticizing those involved for "not being active enough" to prevent the
loss of life.</P>
      <P>Although the case occurred outside Taichung City, Hu said he had instructed the
city's Bureau of Social Affairs to review its measures based on the tragedy.
Social workers should not follow "regular rules when it is a possible matter of
life and death," he pointed out.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, describing the case as a significant warning and reminder for social
workers, Taichung City Department of Social Affairs Deputy Director Li Kun-ming
said that if the girl had been forcibly taken from her mother,  the tragedy
would have been prevented.</P>
      <P>However, he also acknowledged that in Taichung City, every social worker is
tasked with handling an average of 100 cases or more at a time. " They are not
omnipotent and it is a heavy burden to ask them to take full responsibility, "
Li said.</P>
      <P>A similar review and self-examination also began in the Taichung County
Department of Social Affairs.</P>
      <P>During a review meeting, department Director Wang Hsiu-yen acknowledged that the
Tsaos' death reflects the fact that their social workers lack experience and
professional judgment, and that defects exist in the reporting and communication
system.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei, April 19 (CNA The Republic of St. Christopher and Nevis, also known as
St. Kitts, has upgraded the post of its representative to Taiwan from charge
d'affaires to resident ambassador.</P>
      <P>Jasmine Huggins,  St.  Kitts's first ambassador to Taiwan, presented her letters
of credence to President Ma Ying-jeou Monday in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Huggins said at a reception later in the day that her new appointment as
ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary signals a deepening of the
friendship between St. Kitts and Taiwan and is a significant milestone in her
diplomatic career.</P>
      <P>"When I was asked to come to Taiwan to establish the (St. Kitts) embassy in
December 2007, I could not have imagined that my acceptance of that grave
responsibility would have taken me on this remarkable journey that would grant
me such enormous professional and personal satisfaction," she said.</P>
      <P>"The beauty of this country, the richness of its culture and the warmth of its
people quickly eroded any doubts that assailed me, and made a difficult task
manageable."</P>
      <P>The St. Kitts embassy in Taiwan was established 24 years after the two countries
sealed diplomatic relations. The office was set up amid a growing trend of
students from the Caribbean country coming to Taiwan to study.</P>
      <P>Even so, there are only about 15 students from St. Kitts studying at
universities in Taiwan at the moment. But Huggins said one of her aims is to
expand this area of cooperation between Taiwan and St. Kitts.</P>
      <P>"I shall  endeavor  to vigorously  pursue  the educational opportunities that
exist in the Republic of China for the youths of the federation wishing to
further their studies, " she pledged.</P>
      <P>"Our people-to-people exchanges, whether political, cultural or educational, can
only serve to foster understanding, engender respect and build lasting
relationships that would serve us in good stead in years to come."</P>
      <P>Another of the ambassador's stated priorities is to promote her country as a
competitive market for investment opportunities in areas such as tourism, light
manufacturing, information technology and agriculture.</P>
      <P>"I will assiduously work to create partnerships that would bind our countries
ever closer as we pursue the collective purpose of improving the quality of life
for our citizens. So potential investors from Taiwan whose ideas and energies
are in sync with those of our federation would find a welcoming and attractive
business climate," she said.</P>
      <P>At the reception, Hou Ping-fu, the director-general of the 3rd Bureau of the
Presidential Office, described Huggins as a highly experienced diplomat who
understands where the priorities lie in the relations between Taiwan and St.
Kitts.</P>
      <P>He said the frequent visits by high level officials between the two countries
are an indication of the importance the two sides attach to the ties that they
share.</P>
      <P>St. Kitts and Taiwan established diplomatic relations in 1983, immediately after
the Caribbean nation gained independence from Britain. The island country is one
of Taiwan's five allies in the Caribbean region.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's representative offices in Europe have geared up to help Taiwanese
travelers stranded there due to the closure of many European airports over
hazardous clouds of volcanic ash sweeping across the area from Iceland, an
official said Monday.</P>
      <P>Noting that many Taiwanese tour groups are stranded in Europe due to the
grounding of so many flights there, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Shen Lu-
hsun said at a Legislative Yuan meeting that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
(MOFA) had stepped in to help with the situation.</P>
      <P>"All of our representative offices in affected European areas, including
Frankfurt, Brussels, Amsterdam and Edinburgh have mustered all of their staff to
help our stranded compatriots, " Shen told lawmakers from the legislature's
Committee on Foreign Affairs and National Defense.</P>
      <P>For instance, Shen went on, all staff at the Frankfurt office have been working
at the Frankfurt airport to help Taiwanese passport holders apply for
provisional visas or entry permits, or to help those who need healthcare
services to get treatment or medication.</P>
      <P>Shen said the overseas offices will also offer maximum loans of US$500 to every
passenger in need of financial aid.</P>
      <P>Although there are fewer Taiwanese stuck in Edinburgh, Shen went on, staff at
Taiwan's representative office there have also visited the airport to see
whether any Taiwanese travelers are stranded and need help.</P>
      <P>Shen said the MOFA issued a yellow travel alert immediately after becoming aware
April 16 that clouds of volcanic ash spewing from an erupting volcano in Iceland
had affected flight safety across a large swath of Europe.</P>
      <P>According to the latest statistics released by the Tourism Bureau, 61 tour
groups comprising 1,589 travelers assembled by 14 local travel agencies were
still stranded in Europe as of noon Monday, some of which had been stranded for
up to five days, travel sources said.</P>
      <P>An executive with the Travel Quality Assurance Association advised people
intending to visit Europe to postpone their travel plans until the summer, as
flight services were not expected to return to normal any time soon.</P>

      <P>Rescuers from a whale rescue center said Monday that among a group of 21 pygmy
killer whales found stranded at a harbor in southern Taiwan late the previous
day, 17 had been rescued while four had died after a rescue operation lasting
several hours.</P>
      <P>According to the Forestry Bureau under the Council of Agriculture (COA) , which
sponsors the rescue team from the Taijiang Cetacean Rescue Center, the whales
were found at around 11 p.m. Sunday at Hsinda Harbor in Kaohsiung County.</P>
      <P>The rescue team, which included about 80 people from the Coast Guard
Administration, first tried to use speedboats to lead all 21 whales away from
the coast, but only six of them made their way to the ocean.</P>
      <P>Fifteen of the animals were later washed back onto the beach at around 3 a.m.,
by which time four had died. The remaining 11 whales were finally herded back
out into the open ocean by the rescuers.</P>
      <P>The causes for mass whale strandings of pygmy killer whales, which weigh between
110 kg and 170 kg and mostly live in tropical oceans, are still unknown,
although scientists have cited climate change, seismic activity, or infestation
by parasites, according to Forestry Bureau officials.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Libya eyes investment from Taiwan SMEs</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 19 (CNA)
04/19/10  20:45:05
(By Chris Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Libya is hoping for direct investment from Taiwan's small- and medium-sized
enterprises (SMEs) as the North African country seeks to become the region's
technology hub, visiting Libyan officials said at a seminar Monday.</P>
      <P>Officials from the Libyan Economic Development Board (EDB) briefed dozens of
Taiwanese businessmen on potential trade and investment opportunities  in Libya,
which has maintained warm relations with Taiwan in recent years despite the lack
of official bilateral diplomatic ties.</P>
      <P>EDB Director-General Mahmoud Gebril said the Libyan government launched a series
of ambitious programs in 2007, many of which were designed by the EDB, to
develop the country's modern infrastructure and "soft power," including
education and technology.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's SMEs, especially in the information and communication technology (ICT)
sector, are welcome to invest in Libya and will play an important role in its
national development if they do, Gebril said.</P>
      <P>Mike Hung, chairman of the Taiwan-Africa Industry Development Association, said
trade with Libya is more viable now that the United Nations (U.N.) has lifted
its trade sanctions and bans on aircraft movements, oil exports and arm sales
that were originally imposed over Libya's suspected terror links.</P>
      <P>But he noted that Taiwanese businesses never stopped doing business with Tripoli
during the time sanctions were in force because Libyan businessmen enjoyed good
reputations.</P>
      <P>Gebril, who insisted that the trip was private because of the sensitivity of
Taiwan-China-Libya relations, encouraged Taiwan's SMEs to take advantage of the
country's strategic geographic location, connecting the European Union (EU) ,
Africa and the Arab world and serving as a gateway to the African market.</P>
      <P>He added that Tripoli would provide foreign investors with a wide range of
incentives, such as tax exemptions in a special economic zone, to create a win-
win situation for both parties.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taiwan is also hoping to strengthen its exchanges with Libya.
Bilateral trade volume between the two countries grew by 2.7 percent last year,
one of Taiwan's few trade relationships to show positive growth during the
global economic slump,  said Chang Shih-chang, Europe and Africa Section manager
of the Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA), Taiwan's trade
promotion agency.</P>
      <P>In May 2006, then-Taiwan president Chen Shui-bian made a surprise visit to
Tripoli, where he was greeted by Libyan leader Muammar Al-Gaddafi.</P>
      <P>Saif Gaddafi, son of the leader, reportedly visited Taiwan prior to Chen's
meeting with his father, who has ruled the country since 1969. The visit was
dubbed as a "diplomatic breakthrough" by the Chen administration.</P>
      <P>In addition to the ICT sector, Taiwan SMEs which specialize in the water
purification, solar energy, machinery, infrastructure, hotel, and petrochemical
sectors are also encouraged to invest, Hung said.</P>
      <P>He also suggested that Taiwan's yacht manufacturers could take advantage of
Libya's 1,770-kilometer coastline.</P>
      <P>Libya has been keen to diversify its economy away from its traditionally heavy
reliance on oil exports, Hung said, which is why Libya has announced plans to
privatize more than 100 state-owned companies and encourage more foreign direct
investment (FDI).</P>
      <P>There are dozens of Taiwanese businessmen in Libya at present, Hung said.
Taiwan's state-owned petrochemical giant CPC Corp. has just launched an oil
exploration project this month after winning tenders on oil exploration rights
in southern Libya, he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwanese carriers estimate small losses from canceled flights</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Though a massive cloud of volcanic ash hovering over northern Europe has
disrupted global air travel, Taiwan's two major airlines said Monday that it
would not have a major financial impact on their businesses.</P>
      <P>Shares of China Airlines (CAL) and EVA Airways have plummeted over the past two
trading days because of the air travel chaos. But spokesmen for the two carriers
said that because Europe-bound air routes only constituted a small part of their
operations, the suspension of flights to the region would not prove too costly.</P>
      <P>CAL Director of Finance John Chang said that although the company has canceled
20 flights to and from Europe, leaving about 1,300 passengers stranded in Europe
over the past few days, the continent accounts for only 7 percent of the
company's flights.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for EVA said that between April 15 and April 19, the company
canceled 11 passenger flights and 5 cargo flights to and from Europe, affecting
about 4,000-5,000 passengers, but the number is small compared to the 5 million
passengers it serves every year.</P>
      <P>The International Air Transport Association (IATA) estimated Friday that
airlines around the world were suffering losses of more than US$200 million a
day because of the volcanic eruption.</P>
      <P>CAL said it had canceled flights from Frankfurt and Amsterdam to Taipei, as well
as flights between Bangkok and Amsterdam through Monday but had resumed its
flights between Bangkok and Taipei.</P>
      <P>The carrier also canceled its Tuesday flights from Amsterdam to Bangkok and
Taipei and between London and Taipei, but will resume its Taipei-Delhi-Rome and
Rome-Delhi-Taipei flights.</P>
      <P>EVA's flights between Bangkok and Vienna, London and Taipei and Paris and Taipei
on Monday were all canceled, and all flights to and from Amsterdam and London
through Bangkok scheduled for Tuesday have also been canceled.</P>
      <P>EVA also called off its late night Bangkok-Taipei flight on April 21.</P>
      <P>CAL reported later Monday that it would mobilize three passenger aircraft,
including one from Taipei to Rome via Delhi, Tuesday, to take more than 850
passengers stranded in Europe home.</P>
      <P>EVA will also apply to fly a Taipei-Bangkok-Vienna flight to help bring home its
stranded passengers.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Consumers' Foundation criticized the government Monday for not classifying
beef diaphragms as a high-risk internal organ and said the decision to allow the
imports of the beef part was "unbelievable."</P>
      <P>Foundation Chairman Hsieh Tien-jen said in an interview with the Central  News
Agency that the government's  classification  of diaphragms as something other
than an internal organ was different from the perception of most people.</P>
      <P>The U.S. announced last Friday that exports of beef products to Taiwan will
include bone-in meat, hanging tenders, tongues, penises, testicles, tails,
tendons and diaphragms from cattle younger than 30 months and slaughtered on or
after April 1, which are seen as having a lower risk of carrying mad cow
disease.</P>
      <P>The announcement sparked controversy because some, including Hsieh, saw it as
running counter to a measure passed by the Legislative Yuan in January that
banned the import of U.S. ground beef and internal organs.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said that aside from diaphragms, beef tongue and beef penis should also be
classified  as high-risk  products.  The World Organization for Animal Health
(OIE) has considered designating the latter as a high-risk material, he added.</P>
      <P>The foundation will continue to promote its petition drive to launch a
referendum on rejecting high-risk beef products from the United States, Hsieh
said.</P>
      <P>While some legislators argued earlier on Monday that beef tongue and penis
should be classified as internal organs, the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA)
explained in a written statement that the two were not classified as such.</P>
      <P>The ministry cited a decision by the Department of Health (DOH) last May that
beef tongue was not classified as an internal organ, unlike thoracic, abdominal,
and pelvic organs, which are not allowed into Taiwan under a protocol signed
with Washington last October.</P>
      <P>To help ease any lingering public doubts about U.S. beef products, the DOH, the
MOEA and the Council of Agriculture held a joint press conference earlier
Monday.</P>
      <P>They explained that six types of beef offal announced by the U.S. last Friday
(tongues, penises, testicles,  tails,  tendons and diaphragms) are not
classified as internal organs and imports of those non-high-risk beef parts
would therefore be accepted.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's new top prosecutor pledged Monday not to yield to political pressure or
interference in criminal investigations and prosecution.</P>
      <P>Huang Shih-ming made the vow as he was sworn in as the state public prosecutor
general in a ceremony overseen by Minister of Justice Tseng Yung-fu.</P>
      <P>With the judicial system's credibility under fire, Huang said the country's
prosecutorial system is encountering far harsher challenges than before.</P>
      <P>"But I will not be daunted by any tribulation that may lie ahead and will go all
out to fulfill my mission as the country's top prosecutor and the public's top
prosecutor, " Huang said.</P>
      <P>The new chief prosecutor said his top priority will be to forge a new image of
prosecutorial personnel by defending the rule of law, ensuring respect for due
process, being impartial in exercising judicial power, and getting rid of
political interference in criminal investigations and indictment.</P>
      <P>Under his leadership, Huang said, prosecutors will not waver under political
pressure.</P>
      <P>He also promised to initiate reforms in a number of areas, including improving
prosecutors' attitudes toward criminal suspects, respecting  the  interests  of
the  accused,  and  preserving confidentiality during investigations.</P>
      <P>Huang said he will also push prosecutors to exercise greater prudence in
initiating  searches,  confiscations  and seizures, encourage speedy conclusions
of criminal investigation, and work to improve the conviction rate.</P>
      <P>He further said that he will insist that chief prosecutors closely monitor and
supervise criminal investigations and that they will be held accountable if
there is any dereliction of duty or malfeasance involving prosecutors under
their oversight.</P>
      <P>Huang succeeds Chen Tsung-ming, who resigned Jan. 19 after being impeached by
the watchdog Control Yuan over dereliction of official duty and lack of moral
integrity.</P>
      <P>Some prosecutors of the Special Investigation Division (SID) , which headed the
investigation into corruption allegations against former President Chen Shui-
bian, applied to return to their original work units after Chen Tsung-ming's
resignation.</P>
      <P>Asked about whether the SID will undergo a partial or an overall personnel
reshuffle, Huang said he will come to a decision only after talking to SID
prosecutors on Tuesday about personnel issues and major cases under
investigation.</P>
      <P>On the corruption cases involving the former president, Huang said he will see
to it that prosecutors make every possible effort to seek foreign assistance in
having the Chen family's overseas slush funds returned back to Taiwan's national
coffers.</P>

      <P>Software giant Microsoft Corp. is due to launch a cloud computing services
research center in collaboration with Taiwan's economic ministry sometime around
June, a visiting Microsoft executive said Monday.</P>
      <P>"We've been having several meetings with the MOEA (Ministry of Economic Affairs)
and I guess what I could announce here is we are well underway with launching
something called the Microsoft Software and Services Excellence Center," said
John Kalkman, vice president of OEM Engineering and Services at Microsoft.</P>
      <P>At the moment, the project is under review, he said at a press meet in Taipei.</P>
      <P>"We look to launch this around the Computex timeframe, " he said, referring  to
the  world's  second  largest  information  and communications technology (ICT)
trade show annually held in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Microsoft seeks to provide software and service support to Taiwanese companies,
which excel at designing and making hardware in the field of cloud computing,
the Taiwan branch of the U.S. company said in a press release.</P>
      <P>Cloud computing means that users entrust technology companies with online data

      <P>Microsoft launched a cloud computing service in Taiwan with the country's
largest telecom operator Chunghwa Telecom Co. April 1, which is targeting
400,000 small- and medium-sized companies in Taiwan, the statement said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government is planning to increase its budget for supporting the development
of cloud computing by nearly 70 percent to NT$17 billion (US$540 million) by
2014, an Industrial Development Bureau (IDB) official said Monday.</P>
      <P>Addressing a seminar on cloud computing, IDB section chief Lu Cheng-hua said the
government would like to spend NT$17 billion within four years -- instead of the
NT$10.1 billion planned in February -- to encourage the growth of the cloud
computing sector, mostly by investing in infrastructure.</P>
      <P>If cloud computing, which refers to outsourcing online data storage and
applications, becomes a trend and lowers the demand for hardware, it will
adversely impact Taiwan's manufacturing industry, which has a high concentration
of OEM and ODM contractors, Lu acknowledged.</P>
      <P>The challenge, however, may also bring opportunities, Lu said. The government is
trying to develop cloud computing services and devices by targeting six emerging
industries -- tourism, medicine and health care, biotechnology, green energy,
cultural and creative enterprises, and specialty agriculture.</P>
      <P>Chen Yu-te, a manager of the Industrial Economics &amp; Knowledge Center under
the Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI) , also suggested at the
seminar that the medical, financial and manufacturing  sectors  in Taiwan should
put more effort into developing cloud computing.</P>
      <P>In a bid to grab a share of the growing cloud computing market, more than 50
companies in Taiwan's information and communications technology (ICT) and
service industries launched an alliance early this month.</P>

      <P>The Executive Yuan decided Monday to suspend a plan to set up an anti-epidemic
center and develop international medical services at a planned biomedical
science park in Hsinchu County, after the plan drew opposition from local
residents.</P>
      <P>The decision was made at a meeting to discuss the plan hosted by Premier Wu Den-
yih and attended by representatives from the county government, county council,
universities and academic institutions, according to ruling Kuomintang
Legislator Chao Li-yun, who was present at the meeting.</P>
      <P>Local representatives  expressed  strong opposition  to the initiative, under
which the Department of Health was to set up an anti-epidemic center and give
priority to developing medical tourism at the park.</P>
      <P>They argued it ran counter to a county government initiative to establish a
national-level hospital in the park to provide care to patients with acute
diseases in the Miaoli and Hsinchu area, according to Chao.</P>
      <P>Hsinchu County Magistrate Chiu Ching-chun told Wu that a medical center should
be established at the park to protect the lives of the 2 million residents in
the Greater Hsinchu area.</P>
      <P>Hsinchu County Councilor Chen Chien-hsien added that the quality of medical care
received by residents in the county ranks second to last in the country, and
stressed that it has an immediate need for a large medical center with more than
500 beds.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan decided to suspend the plan at the meeting even though the
contract for the center's design had already been tendered out, Chao said.</P>

      <P>The Executive Yuan said Monday that it regretted the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party's (DPP's) rejection of information on a cross-strait trade
pact provided by the Cabinet ahead of a debate on the issue.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet was responding to a DPP statement in which the party reacted with
disdain to information it received from the government on the cross-strait
economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA).</P>
      <P>"We asked for an apple, but we got a guava," the DPP said.</P>
      <P>The DPP also said the documents would be thrown into the recycling bin rather
than relayed to DPP Chairwoman Tsai Eng-wen to avoid wasting her time.</P>
      <P>Executive Yuan spokesman Johnny Chiang said the DPP's statement was regrettable,
and indicated that if Tsai was not satisfied, she could return the documents
rather than throw them away.</P>
      <P>"Is this how an opposition party should act? " Chiang asked.</P>
      <P>Tsai will debate President Ma Ying-jeou on the merits of the ECFA on April 25.
To prepare for the showdown, the DPP requested access to a number of documents,
including the early harvest list proposed by the government, the draft of the
agreement, and any government- commissioned ECFA assessment reports.</P>
      <P>At Ma's request, the Cabinet provided the information on the proposed trade
pact, but said it withheld the details on Taiwan's early harvest list.</P>
      <P>Chen Ching-tsai, deputy secretary-general of the Executive Yuan, carried the
more than 500 pages of information to the DPP in the afternoon.</P>
      <P>DPP spokesman Tsai Chi-chang said the documents included reports given by the
Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) and the Ministry of Economic Affairs at the
legislature, the information posted on the MAC Web site, the news releases and
public opinion polls.</P>
      <P>Tsai said the government has vowed to sign the ECFA in June, but the public does
not have any access to the content of the pact, and "the party wants to know on
what basis both sides are negotiating the deal."</P>

      <P>The government is planning to increase its budget for supporting the development
of cloud computing by nearly 70 percent to NT$17 billion (US$540 million) by
2014, an Industrial Development Bureau (IDB) official said Monday.</P>
      <P>Addressing a seminar on cloud computing, IDB section chief Lu Cheng-hua said the
government would like to spend NT$17 billion within four years -- instead of the
NT$10.1 billion planned in February -- to encourage the growth of the cloud
computing sector, mostly by investing in infrastructure.</P>
      <P>If cloud computing, which refers to outsourcing online data storage and
applications, becomes a trend and lowers the demand for hardware, it will
adversely impact Taiwan's manufacturing industry, which has a high concentration
of OEM and ODM contractors, Lu acknowledged.</P>
      <P>The challenge, however, may also bring opportunities, Lu said. The government is
trying to develop cloud computing services and devices by targeting six emerging
industries -- tourism, medicine and health care, biotechnology, green energy,
cultural and creative enterprises, and specialty agriculture.</P>
      <P>Chen Yu-te, a manager of the Industrial Economics &amp; Knowledge Center under
the Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI) , also suggested at the
seminar that the medical, financial and manufacturing  sectors  in Taiwan should
put more effort into developing cloud computing.</P>
      <P>In a bid to grab a share of the growing cloud computing market, more than 50
companies in Taiwan's information and communications technology (ICT) and
service industries launched an alliance early this month.</P>

      <P>The Executive Yuan decided Monday to suspend a plan to set up an anti-epidemic
center and develop international medical services at a planned biomedical
science park in Hsinchu County, after the plan drew opposition from local
residents.</P>
      <P>The decision was made at a meeting to discuss the plan hosted by Premier Wu Den-
yih and attended by representatives from the county government, county council,
universities and academic institutions, according to ruling Kuomintang
Legislator Chao Li-yun, who was present at the meeting.</P>
      <P>Local representatives  expressed  strong opposition  to the initiative, under
which the Department of Health was to set up an anti-epidemic center and give
priority to developing medical tourism at the park.</P>
      <P>They argued it ran counter to a county government initiative to establish a
national-level hospital in the park to provide care to patients with acute
diseases in the Miaoli and Hsinchu area, according to Chao.</P>
      <P>Hsinchu County Magistrate Chiu Ching-chun told Wu that a medical center should
be established at the park to protect the lives of the 2 million residents in
the Greater Hsinchu area.</P>
      <P>Hsinchu County Councilor Chen Chien-hsien added that the quality of medical care
received by residents in the county ranks second to last in the country, and
stressed that it has an immediate need for a large medical center with more than
500 beds.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan decided to suspend the plan at the meeting even though the
contract for the center's design had already been tendered out, Chao said.</P>
      <P>Planning for the park has been under way since 2001.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Executive Yuan said Monday that it regretted the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party's (DPP's) rejection of information on a cross-strait trade
pact provided by the Cabinet ahead of a debate on the issue.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet was responding to a DPP statement in which the party reacted with
disdain to information it received from the government on the cross-strait
economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA).</P>
      <P>"We asked for an apple, but we got a guava," the DPP said.</P>
      <P>The DPP also said the documents would be thrown into the recycling bin rather
than relayed to DPP Chairwoman Tsai Eng-wen to avoid wasting her time.</P>
      <P>Executive Yuan spokesman Johnny Chiang said the DPP's statement was regrettable,
and indicated that if Tsai was not satisfied, she could return the documents
rather than throw them away.</P>
      <P>"Is this how an opposition party should act? " Chiang asked.</P>
      <P>Tsai will debate President Ma Ying-jeou on the merits of the ECFA on April 25.
To prepare for the showdown, the DPP requested access to a number of documents,
including the early harvest list proposed by the government, the draft of the
agreement, and any government- commissioned ECFA assessment reports.</P>
      <P>At Ma's request, the Cabinet provided the information on the proposed trade
pact, but said it withheld the details on Taiwan's early harvest list.</P>
      <P>Chen Ching-tsai, deputy secretary-general of the Executive Yuan, carried the
more than 500 pages of information to the DPP in the afternoon.</P>
      <P>DPP spokesman Tsai Chi-chang said the documents included reports given by the
Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) and the Ministry of Economic Affairs at the
legislature, the information posted on the MAC Web site, the news releases and
public opinion polls.</P>
      <P>Tsai said the government has vowed to sign the ECFA in June, but the public does
not have any access to the content of the pact, and "the party wants to know on
what basis both sides are negotiating the deal."</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan to host int'l conference on health promotion</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>London,  April 19 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan has been awarded the right to host the 2012 conference of the
International Network of Health Promoting Hospitals and Health Services (HPH), a
network initiated by the World Health Organization, a Taiwan health official
said Monday.</P>
      <P>The International HPH Network -- established based on the health promotion
philosophy of the WHO as outlined in the WHO Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion
-- recently held its 2010 conference in Manchester, England. Its next
conference, in 2011, will be held in Finland.</P>
      <P>The network, of which Taiwan has been a member since 2006, decided at the
Manchester conference that its 2012 conference will be held in Taipei, the first
time its annual meeting will be held outside Europe, said Shu-ti Chiou,
director-general of the Bureau of Health Promotion under the Cabinet-level
Department of Health.</P>
      <P>Chiou led a Taiwan delegation to the April 14-16 Manchester conference, which
brought together more than 600 health officials and medical professionals from
39 countries.</P>
      <P>Citing the Ottawa Charter, Chiou said the role of the health sector should go
beyond its responsibility to provide clinical and curative services and embrace
an expanded mandate that is sensitive and respects cultural needs.</P>
      <P>This mandate should support the needs of individuals  and communities for a
healthier life and open channels between the health sector and broader social,
political,  economic  and physical environmental components, Chiou said.</P>
      <P>"The mandate is coincidentally in line with that of Taiwan's health culture,"
she told the Central News Agency.</P>
      <P>Chiou initiated Taiwan's HPH Network in 2006 and has since headed the
organization that now comprises 61 hospitals.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan HPH Network was the first of its kind in Asia and is one of the three
largest networks in the world, according to Chiou.</P>
      <P>Member hospitals of the Taiwan HPH Network submitted 74 papers to this year's
international conference, the most of any member country, she said.</P>
      <P>Chiou, who holds a Ph.D. in epidemiology from National Taiwan University  and
formerly served as director  of Taipei City's Department of Health, was elected
to the supervisory board of the International HPH Network in 2008 and is
responsible for promoting the network's influence and operations in Asia.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.S. criticizes Taiwan for tighter inspection of beef tongue</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  April 19 (CNA)
04/20/10  11:56:29
(By Zep Hu and Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) said Monday that it
was "deeply disappointed" with Taiwan's decision to require much stricter
inspection procedures for beef tongue imported from the U.S.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's actions are not consistent with a bilateral protocol signed last Oct.
22, under which Taiwan agreed to lift its ban on U.S. bone-in beef and certain
other beef products, the USTR told the Central News Agency in response to an
e-mail request for comment on the issue.</P>
      <P>Last Friday,  the U.S. Food Safety and Inspection Service announced that exports
of beef products to Taiwan will include bone-in meat, hanging tenders, tongues,
penises, testicles, tails, tendons and diaphragms from cattle younger than 30
months and slaughtered on or after April 1, which are seen as having a lower
risk of carrying mad cow disease.</P>
      <P>The announcement came after a Taiwanese beef importer applied to import 453
kilograms of U.S. beef offal on April 15, the first application to import such
products since last November when Taiwan opened its market wider to U.S. beef
producers.</P>
      <P>The application triggered controversy in Taiwan over how beef offal should be
defined and what parts should be considered as high risk and barred from entry
into Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan passed a measure in January that bars imports of U.S. beef
products classified as "internal organs, " but the term was not clearly defined,
and some believed the items listed in the USTR announcement should be included
as part of the "internal organ" ban.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's government argued Monday, however, that the six types of beef offal on
the USTR list (tongues, penises, testicles, tails, tendons and diaphragms) are
not classified as internal organs, so imports of those non-high-risk beef
products will be accepted.</P>
      <P>But acknowledging that public doubts linger over beef tongue, the government
said imports of the product would require a special import permit and would have
to pass batch-by-batch inspections, a decision not welcomed in Washington.</P>
      <P>"We are pleased that Taiwan authorities have clarified that beef tongues and a
number of other beef products are not considered internal organs, and are
eligible for export to Taiwan, " the USTR told CNA.</P>
      <P>But "we remain deeply disappointed that Taiwan has taken action that are not
consistent with our bilateral protocol, " which the USTR said "was negotiated in
good faith with Taiwan and is consistent with science and the guidelines laid
out by the World Organization for Animal Health and Taiwan's own risk assessment
that found that all U.S. beef and beef products are safe."</P>
      <P>USTR stated that Taiwan's actions will be reviewed carefully, and that it will
utilize all appropriate tools to resolve the issue.</P>
      <P>Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Shen Lyu-shun had said on Monday that the
U.S. "acted unilaterally" in opening beef tongue for export, but the USTR said
that was not the case.</P>
      <P>The U.S. Department of Agriculture "has merely updated the export library on its
website based on information received from Taiwan authorities as to which beef
products are permitted for export, " the U.S. trade office said.</P>
      <P>In answering a question on whether it has requested or will request
consultations to review the implementation of the U.S.-Taiwan protocol on beef,
the office replied that the U.S. and Taiwan have had regular consultations on
the workings of the protocol.</P>
      <P>"Both sides have agreed to continue to consult as needed to discuss the
operation of the protocol and inspection and quarantine issues relating to U.S
beef exports to Taiwan." it said.</P>

(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A standardized contract aimed at enhancing transparency in residential property
transactions will be launched on May 1.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts of the Liberty Times coverage of the story. Liberty
Times:</P>
      <P>A standardized contract that assigns separate prices to an apartment's main
living area, its attached balconies and terraces, and its share of common space
for presold residential units is set to be launched on May 1.</P>
      <P>Interior Minister Jiang Yi-huah warned real estate developers to abide by the
decree, because his ministry is determined to enforce it.</P>
      <P>The standardized contract, which obliges the sellers to list the price for an
apartment's main living area and attached structures separately, is meant
primarily to protect home buyers rather than to check rising real estate prices,
the minister said.</P>
      <P>"It is vital to buyers of houses that have not yet been finished," he said.</P>
      <P>Developers who fail to abide by the directive will be referred to Taiwan's
consumer regulatory agency for possible punishment, Jiang said.</P>
      <P>He added that the Consumer Protection Commission is drafting a revision to the
Consumer Protection Act to impose a fine of up to NT$200,000 on developers who
flaunt the rules.</P>
      <P>"Don't test our determination to protect the consumers." the minister warned.</P>
      <P>Ministry of the Interior official Wang Ching-hsiu said the next step is to
require the sellers of existing houses to follow suit by listing the price of
the main living area and attached structures separately.</P>
      <P>At the same time, the ministry is also considering excluding contentious parts
of the house often priced as part of the main living area, such as balconies and
terraces, from an apartment's formally registered floor space, she said.</P>
      <P>Under the standardized contract for presold units, the seller and buyer will be
required to pay or return the difference in price when the main living area of
the house is more than 1 percent smaller or bigger, respectively, than the floor
space listed in the contract.</P>
      <P>For presold houses sold through installment payments, the payment of each
installment should be at least 20 days apart, and buyers may cancel the contract
within five days after taking delivery of the apartment. (April 20, 2010)</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Chairman Shih Ming-teh -- one of the victims of the political trials following
the 1979 Formosa Incident that pushed for Taiwan's democratization -- alleged
recently that the lawyers who defended the political defendents might have been
"secret agents" serving the then-authoritarian Kuomintang government.</P>
      <P>Some of the former Formosa Incident lawyers might have betrayed their ideals
after making a career switch to politics, but this cannot be interpreted as
evidence that the Formosa democratic movement was sold out from the beginning.</P>
      <P>Those who are accused by Shih of being "stool pigeons" should take positive
action to restore history, such as making public how the legal team was formed
and operated and compiling an oral history on the incident.</P>
      <P>Following Taiwan's democratization, Taiwanese voters rapidly did justice to
Formosa movement participants by electing them to public office. Therefore, many
of the Formosa Incident victims have to some extent become beneficiaries. On the
contrary, this chapter of history could become a victim itself, and the DPP
should not take Shih's accusation lightly. (April 20, 2010)</P>

      <P>A low-emission public library that will enable passengers to check out books
before getting on the train will be launched April 22 on Earth Day 2010, the
Taiwan Railways Administration (TRA) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The environmentally friendly library, located in the lobby of Banciao Railway
Station, will be open from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. year round to all members of the
public, the TRA said. A Taipei MRT EasyCard will be needed for admission.</P>
      <P>Established and run jointly by the Taipei County government and Taipei County
Public Library, the library will be the first in Taiwan to be located in a
transportation hub that serves the traditional railway, an MRT system and
Taiwan's high-speed railway, the TRA said.</P>
      <P>The library will be fully automated,  featuring a digital round-the-clock
monitoring system. Books will be able to checked out and returned automatically,
without the help of a library clerk.</P>
      <P>The facility itself is also a low-carbon environment, with its lighting and air
conditioning systems designed to limit carbon emissions and optimize efficiency,
according to the TRA.</P>
      <P>The railway administration suggested that passengers can borrow books before
boarding trains and return the books when they arrive back at the station later
in the day after school or work.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's train network is not the only group eager to promote reading throughout
the country. Delegates of more than 100 nonprofit organizations gathered Monday
to declare the establishment of the Taiwan NPO Reading Alliance.</P>
      <P>The campaign, aimed at driving up Taiwan's low reading rate, was also launched
to coincide with World Book and Copyright Day on April 23.</P>
      <P>Addressing the gathering, Education Minister Wu Ching-ji said he sees new hope
for the country with Taiwan's NPOs stepping forward to promote reading.</P>
      <P>He said reading is not an exclusive right reserved only for students, but one
that parents and adults should also take advantage of.</P>
      <P>"People who read can see the whole world. Through reading, a man can see higher
and farther, as if he is standing on the shoulders of a giant," Wu said.</P>
      <P>A 2007 survey conducted by Global Views magazine found that Taiwanese  spend an
average of 16.94 hours per week watching television and 7.41 hours on the
Internet, but only 2.72 hours reading.</P>
      <P>This translates to less than 23 minutes a day reading, which is not surprising
since over half of Taiwan's adults are not in the habit of reading, said Lonnie
Lin, a veteran NPO organizer.</P>

      <P>Taiwan did not violate its bilateral protocol on beef imports with the United
States by tightening inspection procedures, as Washington has charged, the
deputy minister of the Department of Health (DOH) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The Office of U.S Trade Representative said Monday that Taiwan's decision to
inspect imported U.S. beef tongue batch-by-batch was inconsistent with the
protocol,  but the DOH's Hsiao Mei-ling disagreed, saying that the protocol
allows Taiwan to impose measures to control U.S. beef at borders.</P>
      <P>Hsiao explained that in the second article of the protocol -- which opened
Taiwan's market to imports of U.S. bone-in-beef and other beef parts -- the U.S.
side promised that Taiwan's inspection and quarantine procedures would be
respected.</P>
      <P>The article authorizes Taiwan's control measures of "three controls" and "five
certifications, " as well as the provisions of the Act Governing Food Sanitation
Act, Hsiao said, reiterating that Taiwan has done nothing to violate the terms
of the protocol.</P>
      <P>The measures set controls on beef imports at the source, at borders and in
markets. The five certifications include verifying certification documents and
checking that shipments are marked with detailed product information.</P>
      <P>They also involve opening a high percentage of cartons of imported beef to check
the product, conducting food safety tests and being able to get information  on
suspected  problem products immediately.</P>
      <P>Both the DOH and the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) said at a joint press
conference the previous day that certain beef offal items allowed to be imported
to Taiwan -- including tongues, penises, testicles, tails, tendons and
diaphragms -- should come from among 40 U.S. government-certified butchers.</P>
      <P>Once  tongue  imports  arrive,  they  will be subject  to batch-by-batch
inspections. The same complete check will also be used for other imported beef
cuts, but if they pass the checks, only 5 percent of the cartons in subsequent
shipments will be inspected, officials said.</P>
      <P>The DOH and the MOEA's Bureau of Foreign Trade held another press conference
Tuesday, adding diaphragms and testicles to beef tongue as items that will
undergo strict batch-by-batch checks.</P>
      <P>Bureau Director-General Huang Chih-peng said the importer who applied on April
15 to import 453 kilograms of beef tongue and diaphragms -- which started the
controversy -- had called the bureau to withdraw an application for an import
permit, saying the goods had yet to be shipped by the supplier.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AIT reaffirms safety of U.S. beef imports</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The safety of U.S. beef, especially new items that were added to the import list
this month, is guaranteed, the top U.S. official in Taiwan said Tuesday as he
tried to diffuse a new controversy over U.S. beef that he contended was created
by local politicians.</P>
      <P>"What's now being talked about being imported were not part of the 13 items that
were excluded specifically by the amendment that was passed by the Legislature
Yuan, " said William Stanton, the director of the American Institute in Taiwan
(AIT) Taipei Office.</P>
      <P>The controversy arose after the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and
Inspection Service (FSIS) announced last Friday that exports of beef products to
Taiwan will include bone-in meat, hanging tenders, tongues, penises, testicles,
tails, tendons and diaphragms from cattle younger than 30 months and slaughtered
on or after April 1, which are seen as having a lower risk of carrying mad cow
disease.</P>
      <P>Local politicians  and the Consumers'  Foundation  chairman criticized Taiwan's
government Monday for not classifying beef diaphragms as a high-risk internal
organ and said the decision to allow the imports of the beef part was
"unbelievable."</P>
      <P>They argued that the new announcement runs counter to a measure passed by the
Legislative Yuan in January that banned the import of U.S. ground beef and
internal organs and insisted that beef tongue and testicles should also be
listed as "internal organs."</P>
      <P>Stanton said that in English, all of the items are referred to as offal, while a
distinction exists in Chinese between "offal" and "internal organ."</P>
      <P>Beef tongue, he said, "meets the definition as defined by Taiwan law, by its
amendment, and by our agreement, so there really shouldn't be any problem."</P>
      <P>"It's unfortunate that I think that some people for political reasons are making
this into an issue again, and it should not be, " he added.</P>
      <P>Stanton said that he himself eats beef tongue, the most talked about item in the
controversy, and noted that beef tongue has never being excluded by anyone nor
was it excluded by the U.S.-Taiwan agreement.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's inspection process is a matter for Taiwan to decide, he said, so long
as it is not inconsistent with its agreement with the U.S. Meanwhile, the U.S.
is confident that all its beef is safe and passed inspection in the U.S., he
said.</P>
      <P>Shen Lyushun, Taiwan's deputy minister of foreign affairs, told legislators
Monday that the new measure was "a unilateral action implemented by the U.S."</P>
      <P>In response, Stanton said he "didn't think the particular statement accurately
reflected the foreign ministry's point of view."</P>

    <HEADLINE>Commercial Times: Stunned by the so-called tax reform</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>04/20/10  15:38:37
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government's bill on industrial innovation,  which was railroaded through
the legislature, slashes the corporate income tax rate from the 20 percent
originally envisioned to 17 percent, in a bid to pre-empt opposition from the
Democratic Progressive Party.</P>
      <P>We are stunned by the result, which will seriously damage the country's finances
and runs contrary to the country's long-term goal of developing a healthy tax
system.</P>
      <P>"Lower tax rate, broader tax base" is a fundamental principle followed by all
tax planners around the world in mapping out taxation systems. Businesses in
Taiwan currently face a nominal income tax rate of 25 percent, but those favored
under a previous industrial innovation statute were actually paying a marginal
tax rate of 5-10 percent on average, which gave them undue advantages.</P>
      <P>To address this unfair tax system, a tax reform panel assembled by the
government in 2008 worked out a plan to wipe out targeted tax breaks while
lowering the overall corporate income tax rate.</P>
      <P>Wiping out most of the tax incentives was expected to raise revenues and
compensate for shortfalls expected from cutting the general corporate  income
tax rate to 20 percent,  increasing deductions and lowering marginal tax rates
for individual taxpayers, and cutting the maximum inheritance tax rate from 50
percent to 10 percent.</P>
      <P>This blueprint was not perfect, but it was organized and took into consideration
the country's overall interests and the benefits of various sectors.</P>
      <P>The panel's efforts were undone, however, by the administration and ruling
Kuomintang (KMT) lawmakers who considered the plan nothing more than a series of
unrelated tax breaks.</P>
      <P>Those who decided to lower the corporate income tax rate further than previously
envisioned failed to realize that any cut in taxes for one economic sector will
affect other sectors.</P>
      <P>They also mistook the country's finances as a means to improve enterprises'
finances, without acknowledging that a fair tax system is vital to the country's
sustainable development.</P>
      <P>Also, the finance minister didn't lift a finger to remind them of this, let
alone pull his weight in defending tax fairness.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou rammed the bill through the legislature in adesperate
effort to shed the image that he has failed to provide leadership to the
country, but the reckless process use to decide the issue was nothing short of
astounding. (April 20, 2010)</P>

      <P>Kuo Kuang Motor Transport, one of Taiwan's major long-distance bus operators,
announced Tuesday that a first group of five buses catering to cyclists will
depart from Taipei to scenic Sun Moon Lake May 1.</P>
      <P>Wu Chang-hsi, president of the bus company, said the exclusive "ibb life" (I
bike bus life) buses have been converted from passenger coaches, with about half
the seats pulled out to make room for two-wheeled vehicles.</P>
      <P>Only 20 seats for passengers remain, with the rest of the space occupied by
bicycle racks. Up to 23 bicycles can be stored in the bus if luggage locker
space, which can hold four bikes, is included, he said.</P>
      <P>Wu said that cars and bicycles have become vehicles of leisure for many people,
but current transportation trends have either separated the transport of people
and bicycles or forced people to carry them in or on their cars.</P>
      <P>Some motorists, however, are reluctant to load their bicycles onto their cars
out of fear of scratches or concerns over the bikes' ability to withstand the
sun and the wind, Wu said, a problem the ibb life buses will eliminate.</P>
      <P>"Our buses will serve the bikes as if they were humans," he said.</P>
      <P>Bicycles stored in the ibb life buses will be insured against damage along the
way.</P>
      <P>The first five buses to depart for Sun Moon Lake in Nantou County are fully
booked. Passengers will pay a discounted price of NT$3,200 for bus fare, a one-
night hotel stay, and two meals.</P>
      <P>The same package for individuals in the future will be NT$4,200 on weekdays and
NT$5,200 on weekends. Separate group tour deals will also be available.</P>
      <P>Wu said there will be five ibb life buses in service initially, but if the
response is good, he would not rule out the possibility of increasing his fleet
to 30 bike buses by the end of the year.</P>
      <P>"In the long run, the goal is 50 such buses, " he said, adding that once the
service reaches a certain scale, the bus company will begin regular and backpack

    <DATELINE>04/20/10  16:17:45
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The most disappointing aspect of a government is not corruption, but when it
allows a child to die because of government negligence.</P>
      <P>Early this month, a 13-year-old girl told her teachers that her mother intended
to kill her and commit suicide. The mother took the girl away from school the
next day, despite efforts by school officials to keep the girl away from the
mother. When social workers finally reported the case to police -- more than 10
days later -- the pair had already been dead since probably April 4.</P>
      <P>There were three opportunities to save the girl, all of which were missed. Had
the school authorities insisted on not allowing the girl to leave, she might
still be alive. If police and social workers had arrived immediately upon
receiving a report from the school, she might not have died. Had social workers
and police visited the girl and her mother April 3, the mother might have been
prevented from killing her child.</P>
      <P>We cannot rebuke the social workers, because there are too few of them. Their
workloads are far heavier than their U.S. and European counterparts, and
negligence is inevitable as a result of their exhaustion.</P>
      <P>We advocate decreasing the number of superfluous civil servants and increasing
the number of social workers. The shortage of social workers is the government's
fault and is yet another example of a system that is killing people. (April 20,

    <TEXT>
      <P>An environmental protection group invited the public Tuesday to visit its Web
site to sign an appeal asking the government to ban the import of seal oil.</P>
      <P>Chen Yu-ming of the Environment &amp; Animal Society of Taiwan said 4,480 people
had already signed the appeal, and she said it will be handed to the Council of
Agriculture when 10,000 signatures are collected.</P>
      <P>Since the campaign was launched a week ago, two brands of seal oil on the local
market have already been removed from the shelves of two retail chains, she
said.</P>
      <P>The group drew attention to its seal oil ban initiative by posting a film shot
by environmentalists showing the brutal culling of seals in Canada on its Web
site.</P>
      <P>Chen told a news conference last Tuesday that Canada allows its fishermen to
cull 380,000 seals a year, even though the seals account for only 5 percent of
the fishermen's annual income.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, the culling process is brutal. Canadian fishermen kill these
seals by knocking them on head with a cudgel and skinning them while they lie
helplessly in a pool of blood struggling to stay alive.</P>
      <P>"All this was recorded in a film shot by the Humane Society International and
posted on our Web site," Chen said at the time.</P>
      <P>"Many of the seal cubs, which are only one month old, are killed while lying on
the ice and waiting for their mothers to feed them, " Chen said, adding that it
was the world's largest massacre of marine mammals every year.</P>
      <P>Although seals are not listed as an endangered species by the United Nations
Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora,
products using seal ingredients are widely banned in the West, Chen said, and
she urged Taiwan to follow suit.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has become the fourth leading market for Canadian seal products. From
2003 to 2009, it imported 431,364 kilograms of seal oil, an amount requiring the
killing of 120,000 seals, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Seal oil is rich in omega-3 fatty acids, but its proponents contend that it
provides a higher concentration of the essential fatty acids that reduce the
risk of cardiovascular disease than other fish oils, driving demand for the
product.</P>
      <P>Chen argued, however, that seals need not be killed because every nutrient found
in the seal oil can be obtained from other natural sources.</P>
      <P>An official from the Council of Agriculture said on the condition of anonymity
that the council will not impose the ban until there is a consensus to do so.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's only running water supplier said Tuesday that water rationing might be
imposed in the greater Tainan area by mid-June if the ongoing drought in the
region persists.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Water Corp. (Taiwater) said that although water reserves in major
reservoirs in the area have continued to decline due to the drought, water
supplies have remained normal at about 840,000 cubic meters per day.</P>
      <P>Water reserves in the Nanhua Reservoir have fallen to some 24.37 million  cubic
meters,  representing  about 25 percent of the reservoir's maximum capacity,
while the Zengwen Reservoir has fallen to some 20 percent of capacity, or 68.31
million cubic meters, and the Wushantou Reservoir is at about 55.83 million
cubic meters, which is roughly 50 percent of its full capacity, according to
Taiwater.</P>
      <P>An official of Taiwater's Sixth District Administration said that according to
hydrologic statistics compiled by Taipower over the past decade or so, May 20 is
a crucial date, as it usually rains after that day, ending the annual dry season
in the greater Tainan area.</P>
      <P>"If it doesn't rain after May this year, it will be necessary for Taiwater to
limit water supplies," the official warned.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile that day, the Executive Yuan passed a bill allowing the Ministry of

years to dredge silt from the three main reservoirs in the greater Tainan area

      <P>The seventh Taiwan-Hubei (Wuhan) Week opened at the Grand Hotel in Taipei City
Tuesday, where participants hope to expand commercial, technological, cultural
and agricultural exchanges between Taiwan and central western China.</P>
      <P>A big delegation from Hubei Province, headed by Communist Party of China Hubei
Provincial Committee Secretary Luo Qingquan, is attending the annual event
organized by Hubei, which is being held in Taiwan for the first time.</P>
      <P>At the opening ceremony, Lien Chan, honorary chairman of Taiwan's ruling
Kuomintang (KMT), described Hubei as a significant province in central China
that has attracted over 2,000 Taiwanese investors and is home  to between  70
and  80 Taiwan-invested  agricultural enterprises.</P>
      <P>He said he anticipated that the event will further help boost industrial and
commercial cooperation.</P>
      <P>Preston Chen, chairman of the Taipei-based Chinese National Federation of
Industries, said he expected Luo's plan to visit local farms and make direct
contact with local people would be beneficial to mutual exchanges in the future.</P>
      <P>Those ties are also expected to be "closer" after the two sides ink an economic
cooperation framework agreement, he said.</P>
      <P>As of the end of 2010, there were 2,080 Taiwanese businesses operating in Hubei,
with total investment of US$5.8 billion, according to Chen.</P>
      <P>Luo's 1,000-member delegation is comprised of officials of the Hubei provincial
government, 17 provincial city governments, leaders of state-run and private
enterprises, and performing artists.</P>
      <P>In his address, Luo pinpointed cultural exchanges as one of the most important
segments of cross-strait exchanges, and he suggested that Taiwan encourage more
Taiwanese students to study in Hubei while pledging that Hubei would encourage
its students to study in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Luo also suggested that the two sides expand cooperation in the areas of
agriculture, technology, green energy, low-carbon commerce, information
technology and herbal medicine.</P>
      <P>Hubei has begun developing an industrial park for Taiwanese businesses and a
Taiwan farmers' park, new facilities that Luo touted as providing considerable
space for future cooperation between the industrial sectors from the two sides.</P>
      <P>The opening was attended by many influential entrepreneurs in Taiwan, including
Uni-President Enterprises Corp. CEO Jason C.S. Lin, Compal Group Chairman Rock
Hsu, Taiwan Glass Group Chairman P.F. Lin, Hon Hai Group Chairman Terry Gou, and
Far Eastern Group Chairman Douglas Hsu.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan's medical team in Qinghai praised by health official</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>China's Vice Minister of Health Yin Li on Tuesday praised the expertise and
experience of Taiwan Red Cross Society's medical team when he visited quake-
affected victims at a hospital in Qinghai, northwestern where the team was
serving.</P>
      <P>The 20-member Taiwan medical team with about 1,000 kg of medicines and relief
goods, left Taiwan Sunday for Qinghai to provide medical assistances to the
victims of the magnitude-7.1 quake that hit the Yushu county April 14.</P>
      <P>Yin viisted the Xining First People's Hospital intensive care units to see the
victims seriously injured in the quake, and said that that with the best medical
equipment in the hospital and assistance from Taiwan's medical team, they will
recover soon.</P>
      <P>Yin said the arrival of Taiwan's medical team is a demonstration of the
freiendship between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, as well as the spirit of
"blood running thicker than water."</P>
      <P>Noting that half of the memders of Taiwan's medical team had taken part in the
rescue mission in the Sichuan earthquake on May 12, 2008, he said this also
shows the close interaction between the two sides.</P>
      <P>Yin said that after the big temblor in Yushu County area, Taiwan's Red Cross
Society had asked to send a medical team there, but because the affected area is
on a plateau with no convenient transportation, and most of the victims had been
transported outside, China arranged for Taiwan's team to serve in Xining's
hospital instead. (By Chou Kuang-hung and Lilian Wu)</P>

    <HEADLINE>10 Chinese tourists injured in Alishan bus accident</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Ten Chinese tourists were hurt Tuesday in a road accident which occurred on
Alishan mountain in southern Taiwan's Chiayi County, with five seriously
injured, according to local sources.</P>
      <P>The 10 tourists on two separate small buses were wounded when one of the buses
collided with a sport utility vehicle (SUV) while coming down from the mountain
-- one of the top tourist destinations in Taiwan for Chinese visitors, the
county's firemen said.</P>
      <P>The first tour bus crashed against the SUV at the 83.5 kilometer spot of the
Alishan Freeway. Eight female Chinese tourists on that bus were wounded. Two
other Chinese tourists in the second bus got hurt when the vehicle they were in,
which was traveling behind the first tour bus, suddenly braked.</P>
      <P>The 10 Chinese tourists, part of a 27-member tour group from Beijing which
visited Alishan in three small buses, were rushed to a local medical station for
treatment.</P>
      <P>Five of the more seriously injured were later transferred to St. Martin De
Porres Hospital in Chiayi City. None of them were in life- threatening danger.</P>
      <P>Police have launched an investigation into the cause of the traffic accident.</P>
      <P>The tourists arrived in Taiwan Sunday for a week-long visit.</P>
      <P>The Alishan Freeway, which was severely damaged last August by Typhoon Morakot,
remains closed to large tour buses. Until roads are fully repaired, tourists
hoping to visit the mountain must travel in small buses. (By C. L. Chiang and

    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Kuomintang (KMT) is expected to soon begin mediation efforts among
would-be candidates as part of the nomination process for the year-end mayoral
elections in the five special municipalities, party officials said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Instead of holding a primary, the KMT will determine its nominees for the
elections by conscription.</P>
      <P>While it is almost certain that Vice Premier Eric Liluan Chu will run in Xinbei
City and Taichung Mayor Jason Hu will run in the greater Taichung area, the
candidates for Taipei City, greater Kaohsiung and greater Tainan have yet to be
finalized.</P>
      <P>Following the recent completion of opinion polls on the aspirants in these three
municipalities, KMT Secretary-General King Pu-tsung will mediate among them to
single out the best candidate for each city and try to win the losers' support
for the selected candidate, according to party officials.</P>
      <P>The results of the surveys show that incumbent Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin and
Legislator Huang Chao-shun are leading the popularity stakes in Taipei City and
greater Kaohsiung, respectively. In greater Tainan, former Legislator Kuo Tien-
Tsai is in the lead, but his support rating and that of former Legislator Lee
Chuan-chiao, who is in second place, fall within the statistical margin of
error.</P>
      <P>According to KMT spokesman Su Jun-pin, opinion surveys are an important
reference tool during the selection process.</P>
      <P>However, he went on, just because they win the highest support ratings in the
surveys does not mean that the aspirants will be drafted by the party. It only
means that they stand a higher chance of being drafted, he said.</P>

      <P>The CAL flight from Taipei to Rome via Delhi took off at 8: 40 a.m. and was

for Vienna via Bangkok that had been scheduled to take off at 10: 45 p.m. that

      <P>EVA Airways said the canceled flight will be grounded until April 22.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan should open doors to Chinese students: university presidents</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Several university presidents said Tuesday that Taiwan should open its doors to
Chinese students as soon as possible, insisting that there will be more pros
than cons.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's government late last year decided to allow Chinese students to study in
Taiwan, but it will limit the number of mainland Chinese students to under 2,000
a year in the initial stage of the program.</P>
      <P>The presidents of Taiwan's universities said during a press conference Tuesday
that opening Taiwanese universities to Chinese students will not threaten
Taiwanese students in any way, be it in the college entrance slots or job
opportunities.</P>
      <P>National Taiwan University President Lee Si-chen said that more than 80 percent
of university presidents in Taiwan support opening Taiwanese universities to
Chinese students, citing a survey conducted while he was serving as the head of
the Association of National Universities.</P>
      <P>It is a global trend to allow the free flow of students, and Taiwan should not
selectively open its doors to students from other countries but not those from
China, Lee said, adding that he expects local students will be greatly inspired
by Chinese students' attitude toward learning.</P>
      <P>The press conference was held by the legislative caucus of Taiwan's ruling party
Kuomintang (KMT), which supports the move.</P>
      <P>With a legislative committee scheduled to review law amendments regarding this
issue on Wednesday,  the opposition  Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) 's
legislative caucus said earlier Tuesday that they strongly opposed the
government's plan to allow Chinese students to study in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>However, the university presidents said the policy the government plans to carry
out along with the opening, will protect Taiwanese students' interests.</P>
      <P>Michael J.K. Chen, president of Ling Tung University in Taichung City, said that
the government's decision to attach the "three restrictions and six noes" policy
in allowing Chinese students to study in Taiwan will suit local circumstances.</P>
      <P>The three restrictions on Chinese students include restrictions on universities
to be enrolled in the program, the number of students to be admitted, and the
professional areas in which the Chinese students' educational credentials will
be recognized.</P>
      <P>Under the "six noes, " Chinese students will not be given preferential scores.
They will not affect the number of local students to be enrolled, they will not
be eligible for scholarships, and they will not be allowed to moonlight, seek
jobs or take tests for civil service examinations in Taiwan after graduation.</P>
      <P>Chen said the number of Taiwanese students aiming to obtain degrees in China was
1,888 in 2010, and the number has never exceeded 2,000 since 1987; therefore,
Taiwan's move to impose an upper limit of 2,000 on the number of Chinese
students in Taiwan will create a natural balance.</P>
      <P>Chen, who is also the head of the Association of Private Universities and
Colleges of Technology, also pointed out that around 60 percent of the foreign
students in Japan's universities were from China last year, and about 70 percent
of foreign students in South Korea were Chinese.</P>
      <P>Last week, a Ministry of Education official said that at present there is an
imbalance because China permits Taiwanese students to enter  its universities,
but as yet there are no reciprocal regulations in Taiwan.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Wu Deng-yih rebutted Tuesday former President Lee Teng-hui's criticism
of a proposed trade pact with China, pointing out that many of the things Lee
has said in the past were later proved wrong.</P>
      <P>Wu was responding to remarks made by Lee April 17 when he blasted the
administration of President Ma Ying-jeou for insisting on signing the cross-
strait economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) despite public misgivings
that it would make Taiwan even more dependent on China and would cost the
country jobs.</P>
      <P>Lee also said the inking of the ECFA will be China's first step toward
swallowing Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Asked during a TV interview about two ruling Kuomintang (KMT) legislators, Shyu
Jong-shyong and Lo Shu-lei, who accused the government of having failed to
effectively carry out risk control on the negative impact of the ECFA, Wu said
the government will do its best to mitigate any such impact.</P>
      <P>He noted that there are 75 KMT lawmakers in the 113-member legislature and said
the views of just two of them do not represent those of the whole party.</P>
      <P>"Their views represent more of a reflective voice to remind the government to
remain on guard," he added.</P>
      <P>Wu said he respects the voice of the opposition and will listen to its views,
adding that as long as it is willing to monitor and come up with better ideas
than those of the government, he is willing to adopt them.</P>
      <P>Asked why Taiwan should not sign a cross-strait peace agreement and demand that
China withdraw the more-than 1,000 missiles targeting Taiwan, Wu said he would
not agree to sign such a pact if all China had to do was withdraw its missiles.</P>
      <P>Wu said the time for the signing of a peace accord is still "far off. "</P>
      <P>Withdrawing that missiles would not be enough, Wu went on, adding that more
should be done to persuade China to stop squeezing Taiwan's maneuvering  space
in the international  community,  that more cross-strait trade, economic and
cultural exchanges could foster more mutual trust, and that China's freedom,
democracy and rule of law should grow.</P>
      <P>"When enough goodwill is accumulated over the long term, we can talk about
signing a peace accord," Wu said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's foreign ministry said Tuesday that it did not ask a third party to help
invite the former U.S. President George W. Bush to visit Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Tuesday that it directly contacted Bush's
office to arrange the visit and that a third party was never involved in the
process.</P>
      <P>In a statement, the ministry said Foreign Minister Timothy C.T. Yang has made it
clear that he represented President Ma Ying-jeou in inviting Bush to visit
Taiwan during his trip to Dallas in early December 2009.</P>
      <P>The foreign ministry issued the statement days after the China Times Weekly
reported that Jack Hu, a 25-year-old Chinese American, said in an exclusive
interview with the local Chinese-language magazine that he was asked by the
ministry to deal with the invitation.</P>
      <P>Hu added in the interview that he began helping arrange the visit after Harry
Tseng, director-general of the ministry's Department of North American Affairs,
asked him about the possibility of inviting a former head of state from the
United States to Taiwan during a telephone conversation in October last year.</P>
      <P>Bush, who left office in 2009, was reported to make the visit in late April. But
the ministry said earlier this month that the visit was not possible because of
Bush's tight schedule during his tour of Asia.</P>
      <P>Taiwan sees the U.S. as one of its major allies despite the lack of diplomatic
ties between the two.</P>
      <P>The foreign ministry said it will ask Taiwan's representative to the U.S. --
Jason Yuan - to continue to invite Bush as part of the ministry's efforts to
promote bilateral relations.</P>

the inauguration of the Taiwan pavilion at the 2010 World Expo in Shanghai,
ministry officials said later that day.</P>
      <P>The ministry give its green light to Liu's application on the grounds that the

      <P>Vice Premier Eric Liluan Chu said Tuesday that the National Stabilization Fund
(NSF) might completely withdraw from Taiwan's stock market next month and that
the government will set a strict standard for the fund to enter the local stock
market in the future.</P>
      <P>Chu said in a televised interview that he is optimistic about the outlook for
the stock market, citing the fact that the Chung-Hua Institution  for Economic
Research recently revised upward its forecast for economic growth this year to
4.99 percent, compared to the government's growth forecast of at least 4.8
percent.</P>
      <P>In addition, the ample funds in the market, the signing of a proposed economic
cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) with China, and an expected cut in
corporate tax are all positive factors for the stock market, Chu added.</P>
      <P>He expressed confidence that the NSF will no longer be needed to stabilize the
stock market as it did in late 2008 and early 2009.</P>
      <P>According  to statistics,  the  NSF bought  about  NT$59.9 billion-worth of
shares between late 2008 and early 2009, and has been gradually selling its
holdings since the beginning of the year, he said.</P>
      <P>The pace of selling has been very slow, Chu went on, denying media reports that
the government-run fund has sold NT$10 billion to NT$20 billion in a single day.</P>
      <P>The fund earned a profit of about NT$27 billion by selling more than two-thirds
of the shares it bought during the 2008-2009 period, with the rate of returns
estimated at over 60 percent, he said.</P>
      <P>He continued, however, that the fund was not aimed at making profits or long
term investments and was required to withdraw from the stock market following a
decision by the fund's management committee in January.</P>
      <P>Chu also pointed out that stricter standards will be applied for the fund to
enter the stock market in the future and that it will not be allowed to buy
shares when the TAIEX drops only 200 to 300 points, or to sell shares when it
surges just 400 or 500 points.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FPG's Jenwu plant could face record pollution fine</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) asked the Kaohsiung county government
Tuesday to fine Formosa Plastics Group (FPG) for serious pollution of soil and
underground water at its Jenwu plant in southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The plant in Kaohsiung County could be fined up to NT$150 million (US$4.76
million) , surpassing a NT$130 million administrative fine meted out to the
Kuanyin Industrial Park last year that is the highest of its kind ever levied in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen Hsien-heng, director of the EPA's Department of Water Protection, said the
exact amount of the fine will be decided after a remedial plan put forth by the
Jenwu plant is approved.</P>
      <P>He noted that the Jenwu plant has known since December 2003 that the underground
water was seriously polluted in its plant complex, but has failed to alert the
authorities and has not adopted emergency contingency measures.</P>
      <P>It was not until 2009, when the EPA entered the plant to conduct an
investigation, that the plant installed recycling wells to stem the spread of
the pollutants.</P>
      <P>Chen said that during the inspection, the EPA also discovered that the plant had
applied for a refund of nearly NT$40 million in the name of new investment for
anti-pollution facilities. The fund has yet to be approved.</P>
      <P>Chen said that if the Jenwu plant is fined under the Water Pollution Control
Act, it can be fined just NT$600,000 at most, but if the regulation of "improper
gains" under the Administrative Penalty Act is cited, the fine will be much
higher.</P>
      <P>The EPA has tentatively mapped out eight options, with fines ranging from NT$39
million to NT$150 million.</P>
      <P>Amid calls by environmental groups that the plant's operations should be
suspended, Chen said that if the pollution spreads, the plant might be shut
down, but if the pollution does not get worse, it will be permitted to continue
operating.</P>
      <P>Amid public concern about the safety of drinking water in the vicinity of the
plant, Kaohsiung county government environmental protection officials said that
96 percent of the people use tap water for drinking, while only a small number
use underground water, mostly for washing.</P>
      <P>County government officials have started collecting samples from the wells
within the plant as well as wells in six villages surrounding the plant and test
information is expected to be available April 29.</P>

      <P>Increased foreign-based manufacturing by Taiwanese firms is set to seriously
hurt the local job market and drag down private-sector consumption, the Ministry
of Economic Affairs (MOEA) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Although  overseas  manufacturing  is  beneficial  to local enterprises'
globalization, MOEA officials warned that it will also result in more local job
losses and will impact private-sector consumption.</P>
      <P>The percentage of products made by Taiwanese firms abroad rose above the 50
percent level to 50.69 percent in March for the first time in history, thanks
mainly to a sound supply chain they have built in other countries such as China,
the officials noted.</P>
      <P>In the past, the ratio stood always below 50 percent, they went on, voicing deep
concern that the trend will severely impact the local employment market and deal
a heavy blow to consumption in the private sector, despite news of a noticeable
economic recovery.</P>
      <P>In terms of sector, the information technology industry has the highest
percentage of overseas manufacturing at 84.96 percent -- which means that the
vast majority of Taiwan-branded notebook computers are produced outside the
country, the officials pointed out.</P>
      <P>According to the latest statistics published earlier in the day by the MOEA, the
value of export orders local companies received in March recorded a new high of
US$34.39 billion -- rebounding to the levels of before the financial tsunami
that began in 2008 and representing an annual growth rate of 43.66 percent.</P>
      <P>Foreign orders placed with Taiwanese companies in October 2007 were worth
US$32.2 billion, MOEA statistics show.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The gap between the rich and the poor in Taiwan was narrowed 1.69 times last
year as a result of comprehensive efforts by the government, the Council of
Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>CEPD Vice Chairman Hu Chung-ying made the remarks in response to a report by the
Apple Daily newspaper that wealth gap is higher than in either Japan or South
Korea and that it will worsen further in the next two or three years if the
government fails to properly address the adverse impact likely to arise from a
proposed cross-Taiwan Strait trade pact.</P>
      <P>"The difference would have widened to 7.74 times last year from 6.05 times a
year earlier if the government had not put in place tax and social welfare
measures," Hu said in a press conference.</P>
      <P>However,  he did acknowledge that the economic cooperation framework agreement
(ECFA) that Taiwan and China are expected to sign in June will pound some weaker
sectors, increase unemployment and worsen wealth distribution in spite of its
far greater benefit to the country's economy as a whole.</P>
      <P>Hu cited research by the Chung-Hua Institution for Economic Research (CIER) as
forecasting that the ECFA will create more than 257,000 additional jobs and
increase Taiwan's GDP by between 1.65 percent and 1.72 percent.</P>
      <P>For those industries that will bear the brunt of the ECFA, the government has
prepared a comprehensive program to help them weather their difficulties,
earmarking NT$95 billion to be distributed as subsidies, Hu added.</P>
      <P>He further pointed out that the Industrial Innovation Law that passed the
legislature last week will also help contribute to a fairer distribution of
wealth, as under the law,  small- and medium-sized enterprises are entitled a
corporate tax break, unlike its forerunner, the Statute for Upgrading Industry
that expired at the end of 2009 and which offered tax incentives mostly to hi-
tech conglomerates.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Tuesday that it is still trying to
offer help to Taiwanese travelers stranded in Europe five days after air traffic
over Europe came to a standstill.</P>
      <P>Giant clouds of ash spewing from an erupting volcano in Iceland has drifted over
large swathes of Europe, rendering flying hazardous.</P>
      <P>European Union transport ministers have held an extraordinary meeting via video
conference and have agreed on a "progressive and coordinated" reopening of
European airspace with full guarantees of safety.</P>
      <P>According to a MOFA press release, staff of its 26 representative offices based
in European countries have been assisting stranded Taiwanese round the clock
over the last five days and have offered help to more than 900 people.</P>
      <P>Those who run out of money in Europe as a result of the chaos will be granted an
emergency loan of US$500, the press release said, adding that the MOFA is also
coordinating an emergency evacuation plan that will arrange flights to transport
elderly citizens, children and those in need of medical services back to Taiwan
once flights resume.</P>
      <P>According to the EU website, the European Organization for the Safety of Air
Navigation (Eurocontrol) has divided the airspace into three zones based on the
volcanic ash content.</P>
      <P>Eurocontrol explained that the first of these zones is the region beneath the
volcanic plume, where there is still a strict no-fly zone, such as London and
Amsterdam. The second zone, which includes Vienna, covers an area where ash
might be present but in which operations will be coordinated by the authorities
of member states. The third zone is the area unaffected by the ash and in which
there are no flight restrictions, such as Rome.</P>
      <P>Eurocontrol was expecting 40 percent to 45 percent of flights in European
airspace to resume Wednesday compared to 30 percent Tuesday.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of the Interior approved Tuesday an application by former Premier
Liu Chao-shiuan to visit China May 10-18 to preside over a lighting  ceremony at
the inauguration of the Taiwan pavilion at the 2010 World Expo in Shanghai,
ministry officials said later that day.</P>
      <P>The ministry give its green light to Liu's application on the grounds that the
planned visit is a cross-Taiwan Strait cultural exchange only, and involves no
national security issues,  the officials said.</P>
      <P>The former premier will visit Shanghai to officially open the Taiwan pavilion at
the expo in his capacity as chairman of the National Cultural Association, a

      <P>Vice Premier Eric Liluan Chu said Tuesday that the National Stabilization Fund
(NSF) might completely withdraw from Taiwan's stock market next month and that
the government will set a strict standard for the fund to enter the local stock
market in the future.</P>
      <P>Chu said in a televised interview that he is optimistic about the outlook for
the stock market, citing the fact that the Chung-Hua Institution  for Economic
Research recently revised upward its forecast for economic growth this year to
4.99 percent, compared to the government's growth forecast of at least 4.8
percent.</P>
      <P>In addition, the ample funds in the market, the signing of a proposed economic
cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) with China, and an expected cut in
corporate tax are all positive factors for the stock market, Chu added.</P>
      <P>He expressed confidence that the NSF will no longer be needed to stabilize the
stock market as it did in late 2008 and early 2009.</P>
      <P>According  to statistics,  the  NSF bought  about  NT$59.9 billion-worth of
shares between late 2008 and early 2009, and has been gradually selling its
holdings since the beginning of the year, he said.</P>
      <P>The pace of selling has been very slow, Chu went on, denying media reports that
the government-run fund has sold NT$10 billion to NT$20 billion in a single day.</P>
      <P>The fund earned a profit of about NT$27 billion by selling more than two-thirds
of the shares it bought during the 2008-2009 period, with the rate of returns
estimated at over 60 percent, he said.</P>
      <P>He continued, however, that the fund was not aimed at making profits or long
term investments and was required to withdraw from the stock market following a
decision by the fund's management committee in January.</P>
      <P>Chu also pointed out that stricter standards will be applied for the fund to
enter the stock market in the future and that it will not be allowed to buy
shares when the TAIEX drops only 200 to 300 points, or to sell shares when it
surges just 400 or 500 points.</P>

(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President  Ma Ying-jeou's  recent decision  to push for a second-generation
National Health Insurance system marks a rare show of broad-mindedness since his
inauguration.</P>
      <P>A similar show of decisiveness was seen in Ma's rapid decision to lower the
corporate income tax rate to 17 percent in the wrangling over the industrial
innovation bill.</P>
      <P>It appeared that cutting the tax rate in a big way was one of Ma's plans in the
first place, but he dared not put it forward for fear that the opposition
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) might go against it. However, after the DPP
proposed dropping the tax rate to 17.5 percent, the Ma administration took the
opportunity to show its cards.</P>
      <P>More surprising still, Ma announced at the same time that in certain economic
and trade zones, the wages for foreign laborers do not have to comply with the
nation's minimum wage. The moves were like removing two big mountains  standing
in the way of the government's efforts to push for the special economic and
trade zones.</P>
      <P>It is not clear whether Ma has come to this string of prompt policies by chance
or with well-devised considerations. It requires further observation to see if
they will help launch long-anticipated projects to develop Taiwan into an
economic and trade platform in the Asia-Pacific region and set up special
economic and trade zones in the country. They would be means by which Taiwan
could face up to the severe challenges ahead. (April 21, 2010)</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Export orders placed with Taiwanese companies posted 43.66 percent year-on-year
growth in March to set a new single-month record of US$34.39 billion, according
to statistics released by the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The higher-than-expected growth was yet another indication that the local
economy has emerged from a year-long recession amid a global financial crunch.</P>
      <P>But some analysts are worried that the increased export orders will not
contribute to domestic consumption and employment because more than half of the
export orders will be produced abroad.</P>
      <P>The high ratio of overseas production highlights the exodus of local
manufacturers, which could exacerbate Taiwan's structural unemployment problem.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from local media coverage of the issue: Economic
Daily News:</P>
      <P>The combined value of export orders placed with local suppliers in March beat
the previous record of US$32.2 billion set in October 2007.</P>
      <P>"The March amount indicated that our export orders have returned to the pre-
global financial tsunami levels, " said Huang Chi-shih, director-general of the
MOEA's Department of Statistics.</P>
      <P>As orders are an indication of Taiwan's shipments in the next one to three
months to foreign countries, Huang said the March number signals robust export
trade for the second quarter of this year.</P>
      <P>According to Huang, export orders from China, Japan and six major ASEAN nations
all set new single-month records in March.</P>
      <P>As to the effects of the recent closures of major European airports over
volcanic ash from Iceland, Huang said the impact on Taiwan's export orders and
outbound shipments will be limited.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, he added, local companies may face a short-term shortage of parts
and components if they do not have adequate inventories in their overseas
warehouses. (April 21, 2010). Commercial Times:</P>
      <P>While Taiwan's export orders surged to a single-month high of US$34.39 billion
in March, it may not help much to boost domestic consumption and reduce
unemployment as 50.69 percent of the orders will be produced abroad.</P>
      <P>It marked the first time that the overseas production ratio has exceeded 50
percent. In the past, the percentage hovered around 40 percent, but the figure
began to rise steadily last October when export orders gradually regained
momentum amid a global economic recovery.</P>
      <P>MOEA officials said the percentage rose because the ratio of overseas production
in the information technology and electronics sectors shot up from 45.32 percent
in February to 50.36 percent in March.</P>
      <P>As a result, the officials said, the overall overseas production percentage
reached 50.69 percent in March from February's 49.42 percent.</P>
      <P>While local companies' efforts to relocate production lines abroad will
facilitate their global expansion plans, the official admitted that such moves
could adversely affect the domestic job market.</P>
      <P>They further predicted that if the domestic industrial structure is not
overhauled, the ratio of overseas production will continue to rise. (April 21,
2010) Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>Kenneth Lin,  an economics  professor  at National  Taiwan University, said the
high ratio of overseas production will not only worsen structural unemployment
but will also affect domestic wage levels and consumption.</P>
      <P>He reminded the government that the exodus of local IT and electronics companies
will further accelerate once the proposed cross-Taiwan Strait economic
cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) is signed. (April 21, 2010)</P>

      <P>In line with ongoing government restructuring efforts, the Cabinet recently came

could use new technology to make up for decreased manpower. Second, the

heavier responsibilities, collecting accurate information for timely and
efficient statistical analysis to provide a basis for policy-making and resource
distribution.</P>
      <P>We call on the authorities to pay attention to the profound impact that the

    <TEXT>
      <P>Love has proved more powerful than a volcanic eruption as a central European
couple have gotten married in Taiwan after being unable to return to Europe for
their wedding that had been planned for April 24.</P>
      <P>The 32-year-old Juraj Hegyi married Zuzana Marcekova, whom he has been in love
with for 13 years, Tuesday at the Orchard Park Hotel in northern Taiwan's
Taoyuan County.</P>
      <P>The hotel is not far from Taiwan's main international gateway, Taiwan Taoyuan
International Airport, where many passengers have been stranded after their
flights to Europe were canceled because of a volcanic eruption in Iceland.</P>
      <P>None of the couple's family members were present at wedding, but many local
residents, hotel staffers and other European travelers like Hegyi and Marcekova
stranded in Taiwan were on hand to help the couple celebrate their marriage.</P>
      <P>Hegyi, a physician from Slovakia, and Marcekova, 31, a radiology technician from
the Czech Republic, were taking a trip through Asia and had planned to return
home for their wedding in Slovakia on April 24.</P>
      <P>They had visited Thailand, Singapore and Hong Kong before flying to Taiwan for a
transit stop before heading on to Europe, but by that time, the ash drift spread
by the volcano had already shut down air travel over the continent.</P>
      <P>Marcekova said they had to cancel the wedding they had planned for more than a
year after learning their flight home would be postponed indefinitely. That
realization sent Marcekova into tears, according to hotel staff.</P>
      <P>After learning of the couple's story, hotel founder and chairman Li San-lian
decided to organize a wedding ceremony for them within a day.</P>
      <P>Dozens of hotel staffers and workers were summoned to assist the couple in
purchasing wedding rings,  arranging a ceremony and selecting a wedding gown.</P>
      <P>With all of the couple's new Taiwanese friends and her love for her husband, the
"volcanic eruption was nothing, " said the bride after the ceremony.</P>
      <P>The wedding was based on a traditional Christian ceremony -- singing Christian
songs, reading bible passages, and exchanging rings -- and was witnessed by
Christian minister Kao Tien-yuan from Chung Yuan Christian University.</P>
      <P>Family members of the couple watched the ceremony via video conference.
Expressing his gratitude, Hegyi said the passion of the Taiwanese people and the
hotel's assistance saved them from feeling regret for the rest of their lives.</P>
      <P>"Life is full of surprises. Taiwan will be a memory that we will never forget, "

      <P>Violent clashes broke out in the Legislative Yuan Wednesday as lawmakers fought
over draft amendments to two education laws that would pave the way for local
universities and colleges to recruit Chinese students.</P>
      <P>Ruling Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator Chao Li-yun, who was chairing the meeting of
the Education and Culture Committee, fainted during the commotion and was rushed
to nearby National Taiwan University (NTU) Hospital for treatment.</P>
      <P>Chao quickly regained consciousness and is recuperating at NTU Hospital, KMT
legislative caucus sources said.</P>
      <P>Two opposition Democratic Progressive Party legislators, Kuan Bi-ling and Chen
Ting-fei, were also sent to the hospital after sustaining injuries in the brawl.</P>
      <P>The clashes broke out at 9 a.m. immediately after Chao announced the start of a
hearing on draft amendments to the University Act and the Junior College Act.</P>
      <P>DPP lawmakers tried to block Education Minister Wu Ching-ji from delivering a
briefing on the amendment proposals, which would lead to the opening of local
universities and colleges to Chinese students.</P>
      <P>They surrounded Wu and asked him to suspend the proposals, but Wu managed to
deliver a brief report on the MOE-drafted amendments under the protection of KMT
lawmakers.</P>
      <P>Kuan fueled the flames when she displayed an e-mail from the secretariat of a
college association that suggested that nine university presidents who voiced
public support for the amendments a day earlier felt pressured to do so by the
Ministry of Education (MOE) because they receive MOE subsidies.</P>
      <P>More scuffles broke out after the KMT legislative  caucus announced  the start
of the question-and-answer  stage of the committee's review of the two bills.</P>
      <P>Chao fainted after she announced that the two bills had completed their first
review and were to be referred to the full legislature for further deliberation.</P>
      <P>The brawl came to an abrupt end at 9:55 a.m. when Chao was rushed to NTU
Hospital and Minister Wu left the building.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lin Yi-shih, who concurrently serves as the head of the KMT's policy
coordination committee, said the two bills completed their first review in
accordance with legal procedures.</P>
      <P>The DPP's legislative caucus thought otherwise, however, saying that the
procedures have yet to be finalized. DPP caucus members warned that if the KMT
sticks to its guns, they will do their utmost to block the bills at the full
legislative session.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) expressed confidence Wednesday that the
latest controversy on the Taiwan-U.S. beef trade can be handled properly with
mutual trust between the two sides.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has been maintaining fluid dialogue and consultation with the U.S. on the
issue and will make sure the communication continues, said Vice Minister of
Foreign Affairs David Y.L. Lin.</P>
      <P>Lin said Taiwan's decision to strengthen inspections of U.S. beef parts,
including tongues, diaphragms and testicles, should be understandable to the
U.S. government because it is an internal and domestic administrative measure.</P>
      <P>The controversy was triggered by a recent application by a Taiwanese firm to
import 453 kg of beef tongues and diaphragms from the United States.</P>
      <P>In response to the application, the Department of Health (DOH) and the Ministry
of Economic Affairs said beef offal items allowed to be imported to Taiwan
should come from just 40 butchers certified by the U.S. government.</P>
      <P>Once the products arrive, they will be subject to batch-by-batch inspections.</P>
      <P>However, the Office of the United States Trade Representative said Monday that
Taiwan's actions "are not consistent" with a bilateral protocol signed last
October, under which Taiwan agreed to lift its ban on U.S. bone-in beef and
certain other beef products.</P>
      <P>The DOH issued a rebuttal Tuesday, saying that the protocol allows Taiwan to
impose measures to control U.S. beef at borders.</P>
      <P>The Bureau of Foreign Trade said the same day that the importer had withdrawn
its application.</P>

      <P>With most of Europe opening up its skies in the wake of the diminishing effect
of a volcanic ash cloud drifting from Iceland, Europe-bound flights were

      <P>EVA Airways, one of Taiwan's two major carriers, said its three regular  flights
--  Taipei-Paris,  Taipei-Bangkok-Vienna  and Taipei-Bangkok-London -- would

      <P>EVA had originally canceled its Bangkok-London flight, but after the plane had
taken off from Taipei bound for Bangkok, it learned that London's  Heathrow

      <P>Hundreds of Taiwanese travelers who had been stranded in Europe for nearly a
week were finally able to return home Tuesday night when China Airlines (CAL)
resumed service on its Rome-Delhi-Taipei route.</P>
      <P>"We're finally going home! , " was the refrain of many relieved passengers after
receiving their boarding pass for the Rome-Taipei flight.</P>
      <P>A Taiwanese businessman said he had tried to seek a way to return home for a
week before getting on the flight in Rome.</P>
      <P>"You feel helpless when your heart is in Taiwan, but you can't fly back," he
said.</P>
      <P>Nearly 2,000 Taiwanese passengers were stranded in Europe when a volcanic
eruption in Iceland spewed massive amounts of ash into the atmosphere on April
14, forcing the cancellation of flights around the continent.</P>
      <P>With Rome the most likely of European destinations serviced by Taiwanese
carriers to be reopened first, some Taiwanese travelers made their way to the
Italian airport, hoping to catch an early flight home.</P>
      <P>Two Taiwanese businessmen recalled their ordeal after they could not get a
flight home from Milan. Unable to book seats on the Eurostar train between Milan
and Rome, they were forced to take local trains to the Italian capital, said one
of the businessmen, surnamed Huang.</P>
      <P>"We had to change trains four or five times to get here, " he said. 'We both
suffer from high blood pressure and we had to return to Taiwan as soon as
possible because we were running out of medicine."</P>
      <P>They had originally bought tickets for a flight on Beijing-based Air China in
Milan destined for China and thought they could then catch a connection to
Taiwan. But Air China later told them that there would be no flights until May
1, Huang said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taiwan's de facto ambassador to the United Kingdom, Katharine Chang,
said Tuesday that there were currently nearly 1,000 Taiwanese people left
stranded in London.</P>
      <P>Her office has been trying to help Taiwanese citizens in any way possible,
including assisting them in obtaining visas for travel to the European continent
to catch flights home, Chang said.</P>
      <P>The office has also helped travelers find cheaper hotels, hostels or restaurants
and assisted a diabetes patient get medicine, she said.</P>
      <P>After the British government announced that all airports in the U.K. would open
at 10 p.m. Tuesday, Taiwan's two major carriers, CAL and EVA Airways, said they
expected flights from London to Taipei to resume on April 22.</P>

      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih reiterated Wednesday that he will resign if Taiwan's
unemployment rate remains above 5 percent by the end of this year.</P>
      <P>In an interview with a cable TV station, Wu said he was serious when he pledged
earlier this year that he would step down if the jobless rate remains higher
than 5 percent at the end of 2010.</P>
      <P>Asked how the Cabinet  would achieve  the goal after the unemployment rate rose
to 5.67 percent in February, Wu said the increase mainly resulted from seasonal
factors, because many people change jobs around the Lunar New Year holiday.</P>
      <P>The premier indicated that one factor that could bring down the jobless rate is
the replacement of civil servants as they retire from government service.</P>
      <P>He also pointed to job openings that would be created as the global economy
continues to recover, and Taiwan's manufacturers receive more export orders.</P>
      <P>On the possibility that the jobless rate will surge to new highs this summer as

    <TEXT>
      <P>The U.S. Department of State (DOS) has notified Congress of Washington's
continued support for Taiwan's observer status at the 63rd World Health Assembly
(WHA) next month.</P>
      <P>The DOS submitted a report to Congress last week in accordance with a
congressional resolution that required the department to make clear the U.S.
position regarding Taiwan's participation ahead of the annual WHA.</P>
      <P>The report said: "Last year our efforts bore fruit: Taiwan was invited to
participate as an observer at the 62nd World Health Assembly in May 2009."</P>
      <P>For the first time since Taiwan began seeking observer status at the WHA in
1996, a delegation from Taiwan under the name "Chinese Taipei"  was  invited  by
World  Health  Organization  (WHO) Director-General Margaret Chan to participate
in the 2009 WHA as an observer.</P>
      <P>The report said that Washington would welcome the WHA extending another
invitation to Taiwan and that the U.S. will seek confirmation from the WHO
director general that Taiwan is invited to this year's assembly.</P>
      <P>"Our goal will be for the WHO to regularly invite Taiwan every year to attend
the WHA as an observer," the DOS said in the report.</P>
      <P>At last year's WHA, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said
the WHA welcomed Chinese Taipei's participation as an observer and expressed her
hope that "experts from Taiwan will be able to participate consistently and
meaningfully in technical meetings of the WHO, for the benefit of global public
health, " the report said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's participation in the WHA was a positive development and could provide a
model for its participation as an observer in other U.N. bodies, it said.</P>
      <P>"In addition to WHA observer status in 2009, at the urging of the United States
and other like-minded WHO Member States, the WHO made progress toward providing
Taiwan greater access to the work of the organization," it noted.</P>
      <P>For example, it said the WHO secretariat helped allow Taiwan to participate
directly in the implementation of the world health body's International Health
Regulations (IHRs), according to the DOS.</P>
      <P>"The United States will continue to work with the WHO and its Member States to
advance the universal application of the IHRs and to involve Taiwan's experts in
relevant technical meetings of the WHO consistent with our 'one China' policy,"
it said.</P>
      <P>The report went on to say that outbreaks such as severe acute respiratory
syndrome (SARS) , avian influenza, and H1N1 influenza underlined the "need to
involve Taiwan in a meaningful, pragmatic way in the work of the WHO."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou on Wednesday invited joint bids by foreign and local
construction companies for major infrastructure projects in Taiwan, saying it
would be a win-win situation for them.</P>
      <P>Addressing  the  opening  of the 38th  Conference  of the International
Federation of Asia and Western Pacific Contractors' Association (IFAWPCA) , Ma
said his administration has launched many large infrastructure construction
projects in recent years as part of its efforts to help boost domestic economic
development amid a global financial crisis.</P>
      <P>In 2009, Ma said, public infrastructure investment posted a 20 percent annual
growth, which has helped stimulate domestic demand and contributed to job
creation.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan has become a signatory to the Government Procurement
Agreement (GPA) under the World Trade Organization, Ma said his administration
has helped open up US$900 billion worth of business opportunities at home and
abroad for local contractors.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is now about to launch a number of critical infrastructure projects, such
as the Taoyuan aviation city development plan and the Kaohsiung shipping-
aviation hub program, he noted.</P>
      <P>"We are inviting foreign contractors to join forces with their Taiwanese
counterparts to bid for these ambitious projects for mutual benefits," Ma added.</P>
      <P>In the face of the threat of global warming, Ma also encourage contractors
around the world to build more green buildings to help conserve energy and
reduce carbon emissions.</P>
      <P>The three-day IFAWPCA conference has brought together senior executives of major
contractors' associations in 16 Asia-Pacific countries to discuss feasible
strategies for sustainable development in the 21st century, including the use of
new technologies to make buildings safer.</P>
      <P>Taiwan last hosted an IFAWPCA annual conference 22 years ago.</P>

      <P>Close to 58 percent of Taiwan's office workers dream of finding better-paying
jobs to improve their financial means, according to the results of a survey
published Wednesday.</P>
      <P>In the survey conducted by online manpower agency 104 Job Bank asking white-
collar  workers  what they dreamed about,  nearly three-fifths (57.86 percent)
said their most common dream was to change jobs and have a better salary.</P>
      <P>They needed annual incomes of NT$870,000 (US$27,620) on average to make their
dreams come true, the poll found.</P>
      <P>The other top dreams cited, in order, were saving NT$1 million, buying a home,
mastering a foreign language, and starting one's own business.</P>
      <P>They were followed by successfully losing weight, traveling independently,
falling in love, passing national examinations, and getting married, according
to the survey.</P>
      <P>Men and women's dreams varied significantly. Losing weight was the fourth most
popular dream among female respondents but did not figure in the top 10 among
men.</P>
      <P>Conversely, getting married and buying cars were the No. 6 and No. 8 dreams for
male respondents, respectively, but they were not high among women's choices.</P>
      <P>For those born after the 1980s, studying overseas was one of their top 10
dreams, according to the poll.</P>
      <P>Some 80 percent of office workers believe they do not make enough to meet their
needs and feel compelled to find other ways to make money, the survey found.</P>
      <P>They said the best methods to make more money were to get high-paid jobs, better
manage their finances, save money and take on part-time jobs.</P>
      <P>About 66 percent of the female respondents said they were trying to get extra
work at home, while 54 percent of their male peers preferred to have a part-time
job related to their full-time employment.</P>
      <P>Generally speaking, Taiwan's salaried workers take "time schedule flexibility, "
"the need not to disrupt their full-time work, " and "salary" into account when
considering whether or not to work part-time.</P>
      <P>According to the poll, those who already have a part-time job earn an additional
NT$7,875 per month on average, far below the NT$13,040 individuals who have yet
to find a part-time job are hoping for.</P>
      <P>The job bank carried out the survey from April 1-7, collecting 2,755 valid
questionnaires. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 1.86 percentage
points.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Premier explains policy on U.S. beef tongue imports</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 21 (CNA)
04/21/10  18:23:23
(By Lee Shu-hua and Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih defended Wednesday a government  decision to hold back on
approval for imports of controversial U.S. beef tongues, saying that no changes
had been made to the administration's beef policy and that experts will be
invited again to provide a clear definition of exactly which items constitute
beef internal organs.</P>
      <P>Praising the Department of Health's (DOH's) strategy for handling the
controversy surrounding certain U.S. beef offal items, Wu explained that the
decision to hold back import approval and invite experts to provide an
unambiguous definition were made to ensure public safety and calm public doubts.</P>
      <P>The DOH, the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Council of Agriculture
announced at a joint press conference the previous day that imported U.S. beef
tongues, testicles and diaphragms will all undergo the most strict inspection
upon arrival in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Checks will be performed "case by case" rather than "batch by batch" the
government had said a few days previously.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Bureau of Foreign Trade (BOFT) Director-General Huang Chih-peng
suggested  that traders refrain from importing  the controversial beef cuts
until the public doubts have been assuaged.</P>
      <P>The changes, however,  drew criticism from Hsien Tien-jen, chairman of the non-
profit Consumers Foundation, who denounced the government for not prohibiting
imports of high-risk beef products on one hand and for advising importers not to
import the products on the other.</P>
      <P>The government's measures "contradict each other, " he blasted. Eventually,
whole cows, regardless of how old they are, will be allowed to enter Taiwan's
markets, he predicted.</P>
      <P>Taiwan agreed in a protocol with Washington last Oct. 22 to lift a ban on U.S.
bone-in beef and certain other beef products from cattles younger than 30
months. Amid public concerns over the import of high-risk beef products, the
Legislative Yuan passed a measure in January that barred imports of U.S. beef
products classified as "internal organs."</P>
      <P>Wu pointed out that the DOH had invited experts last May 18 to define what
"internal organs" are in terms of U.S. beef cuts. At that time, tongues,
diaphragms and testicles were not included in the category, he said, noting that
it was this definition that allowed the BOFT to begin April 1 to accept
applications for imports of these beef cuts.</P>
      <P>However, since consumers and scholars began to question the safety of beef
tongues for consumption and why the item is not categorized as an internal
organ, the government believes it is necessary to gather experts for a review of
the definition, Wu said.</P>
      <P>The government announced Monday that six types of offal on the U.S. Trade
Representative list -- tongues, penises, testicles, tails, tendons and
diaphragms -- are not classified as internal organs and that imports of those
beef products will be permitted.</P>
      <P>But acknowledging the lingering public doubts over beef tongue, it said imports
of the product would require a special import permit and would have to pass
batch-by-batch inspections.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, amid the controversy that has inflamed debate among politicians and
consumer rights activists, Chung Cheng-wei, a chef at a Yakiniku restaurant in
Taichung City, was quoted by the United Daily News as saying that beef tongues
are covered with nerve tissue. Even if the part close to the tonsils are
removed, they can still be a threat if they come from a place affected by mad
cow disease, he said.</P>
      <P>Beef tongue is a popular menu item at Yakiniku restaurants in Taiwan, and even
beef testicles are seen as gourmet food, the report said.</P>

      <P>A Taiwanese fishing vessel that went missing off Indonesia last week has been
found and is being kept under surveillance by the Indonesian Navy, the head of a
fishermen's association in Liuchiu, Taiwan's southern county of Pingtung said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The Liuchiu-registered Chen Fu Hsiang 16 was found Tuesday, nearly a week after
it lost contact with Taiwan last Wednesday while it was operating in an area
south of Sri Lanka in the Indian Ocean, according to Tsai Pao-hsing, the head of

      <P>Due to high waves and strong winds at the sea off Indonesia Tuesday, the
Indonesian Navy was unable to approach the missing vessel and was only able to
keep a close watch on it.</P>
      <P>So it was still unknown what happened on the boat, Tsai said, citing information

      <P>The association and family members of the Taiwanese captain of the fishing
vessel suspect that the captain might have been hijacked by the eight Indonesian

      <P>Taiwanese singer and Internet sensation Lin Yu-chun -- dubbed "Taiwan's Susan
Boyle" -- was interviewed by two major U.S. talk shows Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Lin used a translator during the interviews on the Ellen DeGeneres Show and
Lopez Tonight, scheduled for broadcast the next day.</P>
      <P>Lin told Taiwanese journalists after the recordings that his feelings were
"indescribable" after appearing on the shows as the first-ever Taiwanese guest.</P>
      <P>"I'm very happy because I'm drawing the world's attention to Taiwan," Lin said.</P>
      <P>The 24-year-old shot to fame after a video showing him singing Whitney Houston's
version of "I Will Always Love You" was posted on YouTube April 6. The clip,
from his performance on Taiwan talent show "Million Star," has tallied over 12
million hits to date.</P>
      <P>On the Ellen Show, Lin said, he presented a live rendition of the song and
received a standing ovation from the audience.</P>
      <P>On Lopez Tonight, he sang "Saving All My Love For You, " another of Houston's
hits, and Bonnie Tyler's "Total Eclipse of the Heart."</P>
      <P>Lin said that it was the first time he sang "Total Eclipse of the Heart"
publicly and that his performance deeply impressed the accompanying musicians,
who encouraged him to seek a career in show business in the United States.</P>
      <P>Asked by George Lopez about what he would like to do the most, the food-lover
said he wanted to hold a hamburger in one hand and a bowl of Haagen-Dazs ice
cream in the other.</P>
      <P>Lin said that Lopez, who was aware of his love for ice cream, had arranged for
ice cream to be sent to his hotel and prepared more than 10 bowls of chocolate
ice cream for him in the studio, as well as giving him a gift certificate from a
prominent U.S. hamburger chain.</P>
      <P>Also on the show, Lin, who weighs 110 kg and is nicknamed "fatty, " recalled his
childhood experience of being bullied because of his size. He advised those who
are having the same problem not to worry and to have confidence in themselves.</P>
      <P>"The best way to get back at your bullies is to excel them, " he said.</P>
      <P>Speaking about the rest of his itinerary in Los Angeles, Lin said he will attend
an American Idol Gives Back concert with tickets presented to him by DeGeneres

      <P>Representatives of major businesses, including Wuhan Bluestar Computer and
Wushang Bulksale, from central China's Hubei Province, signed 35 procurement
agreements with local businessmen Wednesday.</P>
      <P>With Hubei Province aiming to become "China's optics valley," the purchases
mainly involved electronic parts such as flat panels and LEDs.</P>
      <P>Representatives from the Jointown Pharmaceutical Group, one of the top 500
businesses in China, noted that Taiwan excels in biotech medicine and medical
equipment, and the group signed a purchase deal worth US$15 million with a local
biotech firm.</P>
      <P>Jointown also expressed hope that it will be able to sell Chinese herbal
medicines to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Delphi Hubei, meanwhile, purchased nearly US$10 million-worth of automotive
electronic diodes from Taiwan's Actron Technology Corp.</P>
      <P>Hubei buyers also included the Wuhan Zhongbai Group and the Wuhan Zhongnan
Commercial  Group,  whose purchases  were focused on agricultural products and
daily necessities.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese businessmen attending the purchase meetings recognized the importance
of Hubei's geographic location and expressed hope that they will be able to use
the province as a stepping stone into China's domestic market.</P>
      <P>A total of 36 manufacturers from Hubei Province took part in the procurement
meetings.</P>
      <P>Yang Fang, an official of the Wuhan Hanshang Group, said there are not many
Taiwanese products available in Wuhan City, the provincial capital, and that
what is available is mainly sold in supermarkets.</P>
      <P>Yang said it was her first procurement visit to Taiwan, and she expressed
particular interest in beauty care products such as red cypress essential oil,
red cypress shampoo and facial masks, because such products are uncommon in
Wuhan and people generally have to go to beauty parlors to buy them.</P>
      <P>She suggested that Taiwanese businesses should establish agents in China to help
Chinese buyers who want to discuss business with them.</P>
      <P>The procurement meetings were part of the seventh Taiwan-Hubei (Wuhan) week that
opened in Taipei a day earlier,  in which participants  were hoping to expand
commercial,  technological, cultural and agriculture exchanges between Taiwan
and central western China.</P>
      <P>In a related development, meanwhile, a Taiwan-Hubei (Wuhan) Week Cultural
Exhibition opened in Taipei Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Luo Qingquan, secretary of the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party
of China, Taiwan's opposition New Party Chairman Yok Mu-ming, former Straits
Exchange Foundation Vice Chairman Chiao Jen-ho, as well as Chinese painter Zhou
Shaohua and Taiwanese artist Li Chi-mao, attended the opening ceremony.</P>
      <P>Luo was leading a 1,000-strong delegation from Hubei that arrived April 19 to
enhance exchanges between Hubei and Taiwan.  The delegation is expected to make
purchases worth more than US$500 million during the visit.</P>

      <P>Environmental activists held a press briefing Wednesday to urge local firms,
especially  those in electronics and green energy industries, to sponsor an
upcoming conference on climate change.</P>
      <P>More than 100 eco-friendly activists from abroad will attend the meeting, said
Pan Han-shen, the convener of the Green Party Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Major companies in Taiwan's petrochemical, steel and financial industries have
agreed to sponsor the second Conference of the Asia Pacific Greens Network,
which is slated to take place in Taipei April 30-May 2, Pan said.</P>
      <P>"We, however, have met setbacks in raising funds from local electronics and
green energy companies," he said.</P>
      <P>"The event is one of the major climate change conferences in the Asia Pacific
region... It is also the first time for Taiwan to host an event on international
cooperation on climate change, " Pan added.</P>
      <P>Tuvalu's Prime Minister Apisai Ielemia,  who received much attention after
warning that rising sea levels might submerge his homeland at last year's
Copenhagen climate change summit, originally could not attend the conference in
Taiwan due to the organizer's lack of financial support.</P>
      <P>"But after Taiwan's foreign ministry decided to lend a hand, the prime minister
will be able to give a keynote speech at the conference," Pan said.</P>
      <P>The organizer is now seeking sponsorship from 20 local companies, each of which
is expected to offer NT$48,000 (US$1,500) . The organizer explained that they
want to diversify the sources of donations to avoid the dominance of any single
company.</P>
      <P>"NT$48,000  will allow 10 Taiwanese non-profit organization members to take part
in the event. We will also allow one person from each sponsor to join the event
for free to learn more about green issues," Pan said.</P>
      <P>The event offers Taiwanese activists an opportunity to have a dialogue with
delegates from over 20 countries in the Asia Pacific region, the organizer said
in a statement.</P>
      <P>"I believe the great significance of the conference is to help us learn from
other countries that environmental protection means protecting the social and
economic environments as well, which is a world trend," said Robin Winkler, a
local environmentalist.</P>
      <P>"If the natural environment goes wrong, so does the social environment and the
economic environment," he told reporters.</P>
      <P>Miriam Solomon, international secretary of Australian Greens, said: "When people
come together from these different countries, very commonly, they are surprised
at how similar they are and how the struggles we have and difficulties we face
are very similar."</P>
      <P>"We found that normally across the world, if you are speaking the truth, a lot
of people don't like you, " she said. "So we come together to encourage each
other to keep speaking the truth and not to be discouraged."</P>

      <P>The government of southern Taiwan's Chiayi County launched a "Save Alishan Driv

Taiwan's most popular tourist destination but presently suffering a decline --
to 1 million people per year.</P>
      <P>Chiayi Magistrate Chang Hwa-kuan pointed out that since the Alishan area was

last August, the number of visitors has decreased dramatically.</P>
      <P>So far this year, only 94,780 people have visited Alishan for cherry blossom

in 2004, the year following the outbreaks of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
(SARS), she went on.</P>
      <P>Citing Tourism Bureau statistics, Chang said Alishan attracted 175,571
sightseeing visits in the first three months of this year, representing a
decline of 422,046 visits -- or 71 percent -- compared with the same period of
2009. This reflects the fact that tourism in the Alishan area is in recession,
she pointed out.</P>
      <P>In an effort to revive tourism, Chang invited all tour and hotel operators in
the mountain resort area to join the drive. She also urged the central
government to help by opening the Alishan National Forest Recreation Area for
free visits and repairing the forest railway that has been closed due to severe
damage by Morakot.</P>
      <P>She expressed hope that the number of tourists to Alishan will recover to an
average annual level of 800,000 people within a year, and rise further to 1
million within two years.</P>

      <P>Renowned cellist Yo-Yo Ma and the Silk Road Ensemble arrived in Taipei Wednesday
for a performance tour of three cities from April 22-25.</P>
      <P>They will also hold two workshops at which they will share their experience and
expertise with local musicians. One of the workshops is geared specifically
toward young people in the 12-18 age group.</P>
      <P>The concerts, to be held in Taipei, Taichung and Kaohsiung, will feature a
repertoire that includes Ahmet Adnan Saygun: Partita, Opus 31, Allegretto;
Persian Traditional: Ascending Bird; and Chinese Traditional: White Snow in the
Sunny Spring.</P>
      <P>Ma started The Silk Road Project, a non-profit artistic, cultural and
educational organization, 10 years ago.</P>
      <P>"During this time, we have been to Taiwan, Korean, Egypt and many other
countries. In these travels, we feel more part of the world and more human," Ma
said at a press conference Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The aim of the project is to promote innovation and learning through the arts,
he said.</P>
      <P>"The best students are teachers, the best teachers are students, and I think
that the best thing is to share our passions, " Ma said.</P>
      <P>The Silk Road Ensemble was established with the participation of internationally
renowned performers and composers from more than 20 countries. The instrumental
voices include piano, violin, pipa, erhu and many others.</P>
      <P>According to the ensemble, the goals of its virtuoso musicians are to nurture
global connections while maintaining the integrity of art rooted in an authentic
tradition.</P>
      <P>One of the ensemble members, Chinese musician Wu Tong who plays the sheng and
bawu, said the experience of working with Ma since 2000 has changed his life.</P>
      <P>According to Wu, he was rock singer but after he met Ma he started to try
different genres of music. In the process, he learned about tolerance and
understanding, he said.</P>
      <P>Wu also thanked Taiwan for sending medical and relief aid to the quake-affected
area of Qinghai in China. He promised to bring the best quality music to the
people of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The concerts will be held at National Concert Hall, Taipei April 22; Fulfill

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan ready to embrace trade pact with China: president</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 21 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>President and ruling Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou said Wednesday that
the government has readied itself to deal with the impact of a planned trade
pact with China on local industry and workers.</P>
      <P>To mitigate the possible negative effects of the cross-Taiwan Strait economic
cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) on some local industries and their
workers, the government is planning to earmark a budget of NT$95 billion
(US$3.03 billion) over a 10-year period to serve that end, Ma told reporters
after a weekly meeting of the KMT's policy-making Central Standing Committee.</P>
      <P>Citing a study by the Chung-Hua Institution  for Economic Research, Ma said the
tariff-concession trade pact would help create 260,000 jobs for Taiwanese
workers although it would also affect some 80,000 people.</P>
      <P>"This does not mean that 80,000 workers would lose their jobs, rather, it means
that their salaries or benefits might contract," he explained.</P>
      <P>According to an assessment made by the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) , 17
traditional sectors, such as towels, garments, bedding, and Chinese herbal
medicine, would become vulnerable if the two sides ink the trade agreement,
which aim to eliminate tariffs, he pointed out.</P>
      <P>But Ma stressed:  "There  will  be more  advantages  than disadvantages if the
trade deal is put in place."</P>
      <P>"Should we fail to sign the ECFA with China, a lot more companies would be
forced to relocate to other countries and more workers would lose their jobs,"
Ma said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and China are slated to hold the next round of ECFA talks in May or June
in China. Both sides have reiterated their resolve to clinch the agreement the
sooner the better.</P>
      <P>The two sides have tried hard to arrive at an "early harvest list" which will
contain items of trade that will enjoy immediate tariff reduction or elimination
after the agreement is signed.</P>
      <P>Ma said signing a trade agreement with China is particularly significant  to
Taiwan as it will make Taiwanese  goods more competitive in the vast Chinese
market amid fierce competition from countries in the region after China forms a
zero-tariff "ASEAN plus one" free trade area with countries in Southeast Asia
this year.</P>

      <P>The team was led by Chen Chih-fu,  leader of the Taiwan International

      <P>A young Taiwanese cosmetics artist won the coveted top prize at the
International Make-Up Artist Trade Show (IMAT) in Vancouver, Canada last Sunday.</P>
      <P>"It came as a big surprise to me," a jubilant Cheng Wei-ying said in a telephone
interview with the Central News Agency Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Cheng, an information and mass communications graduate of Yuan Ze University in
northern Taiwan's Taoyuan County, is studying makeup design at the Vancouver
Film School. She was the school's first student of Chinese descent to receive
the top award in an IMAT contest. The award carried a cash prize of 1,000
Canadian dollars.</P>
      <P>The IMAT is held five times per year -- in London, Toronto, Vancouver, Los
Angeles and Sydney -- and the contest is open to students and those who have
graduated for less than a year.</P>
      <P>In the final event in the contest, Cheng said that each participant was required
to demonstrate their creativity and make-up skills on a selected model using
themes from the Brothers Grimm fairy tales. Each contestant had three hours to
perform complete makevoers on the model's body, hair and face.</P>
      <P>The 24-year-old cosmetics artist said her entry was based on the tale of "The
Frog Prince" and infused with a sense of modernity.</P>
      <P>"I tried to convey a sense of solitude by styling the model into a cursed prince
who projected an ugly image but possessed a kind heart," Cheng explained.</P>
      <P>Finalists only had three weeks to prepare and assemble materials needed for
their creation, Cheng said.</P>
      <P>"I spent one week sewing a special jacket to be worn by the model and I spent
more than 1,000 Canadian dollars purchasing cosmetics materials, " she recalled.</P>
      <P>She only learned about patches to be pasted on the model's face 10 minutes
before the start of the contest. "Such an arrangement was aimed at testing the
contestant's sensitivity," she said, adding that she had to dye the hair on the
patches before pasting them on the model during the contest.</P>
      <P>Cheng has only studied cosmetics in Canada for a year. "I take great interest in
cosmetics as the human body is the most fascinating canvas for painting and the
feel of painting on the human body is beyond imagination," she added.</P>
      <P>After winning the first international prize of her career, Cheng said she still
has a long way to go to realize her dream of becoming an outstanding make-up
artist.</P>
      <P>"I would not hesitate to travel far to do makeup for somebody and to help
realize his or her dream, " Cheng said, adding that she hopes her creativity and
cosmetics work can help draw world attention to Taiwan.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Participants expressed their views on whether Taiwan should continue or abolish
the death penalty as they pitted themselves against each other in the first of
four public hearings on the controversial issue Wednesday.</P>
      <P>National Taiwan University Professor Lee Mao-sheng, who supports the abolishment
of capital punishment, said the execution of death row inmates has not achieved
the purpose of deterring crime.</P>
      <P>Lee argued that as it is impossible to avoid miscarriages of justice, once a
death penalty inmate is executed, the dead cannot be revived.</P>
      <P>However, Lin Chih-chieh, assistant professor of National Chiao Tung University,
who is opposed to abolishing or conditional scrapping of the death penalty, said
the quality of judicial judgment should be upgraded to deal with the problem of
wrongful convictions.</P>
      <P>Also, Lin said capital punishment should not be carried out in "closed-door
operations," but that legal proceedings and execution proceedings should be made
public.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a group concerned about crime victims' rights asked whether anyone
who supports abolishing the death penalty have family members who have been
murdered, and have had experience dealing with that excruciating pain.</P>
      <P>Sociologist Chu Hai-yuan said that the government's protection of crime victims
is not enough, and that effective protection should be a good policy.</P>
      <P>Chu said the public should be educated on the cause of crime and the purpose of
punishment so as to effectively prevent crimes and increase protection and care
for the victims and their families.</P>
      <P>The issue of whether Taiwan should abolish the death penalty came to the fore
recently when Taiwan's former Minister of Justice Wang Ching-feng openly stated
her objections to the death penalty and her refusal to approve any executions as
minister. Her statements led to public criticism, especially by victims'
families and opposition legislators. Wang later resigned.</P>
      <P>New Justice Minister Tseng Yung-fu has said he will approve the executions of
prisoners on death row if they exhaust the appeals process.</P>
      <P>In view of the controversial issue, the Ministry of Justice recently decided to
sponsor four public hearings to hear the public's opinion on the matter. The
hearing Wednesday was held in Banciao, Taipei County. Three others will be held
in Taichung, Kaohsiung and Hualien later.</P>
      <P>Justice Minister Tseng said Wednesday at the hearing that the ministry will read
through all the cases of the 44 inmates now on death row, and exhaust all relief
measures before carrying out capital punishment on them.</P>
      <P>"The execution of the death sentence will not drag to the end of this year,"
Tseng said.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Justice has not approved an execution since December 2005.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ECFA will not drive down wages to level in China: labor council</HEADLINE>

      <P>Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) Chairwoman Wang Ju-hsuan rebutted rumors
Wednesday that a planned cross-Taiwan Strait economic cooperation framework
agreement (ECFA) will drive down wages in Taiwan to the same level as in China.</P>
      <P>Reporting at the weekly meeting of the policy-making Central Standing Committee
of the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) , Wang said this will not happen because Taiwan
has a higher quality workforce than China.</P>
      <P>Wang pointed out that wages have not dropped in Hong Kong, Singapore, Australia
or New Zealand, all of which have signed trade agreements with China.</P>
      <P>As matter of fact, in Hong Kong, the average monthly wage of workers in the
industry and service sectors rose from US$1,591 in 2003, when it signed a closer
economic partnership arrangement (CEPA) with China, to US$1,765 in 2008, she
said.</P>
      <P>In addition, during that five-year period, Hong Kong's jobless rate dropped from
7.9 percent to 3.6 percent, with the number of employed workers increasing from
3.19 million to 3.52 million, she noted.</P>
      <P>Yiin Chii-ming, a former economics minister and now a minister without
portfolio, said at a news conference Wednesday that the ECFA is meant to help
Taiwan companies maintain their operations at home and attract more
multinationals to set up hubs in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He urged southern Taiwan local government chiefs affiliated with the opposition
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) to cooperate with the central government in
selling the ECFA to the public.</P>
      <P>"They should hold sessions to help local residents gain a better understanding
of the agreement and its benefits, " Yiin said.</P>
      <P>Eight local government chiefs last week signed a joint pledge, denouncing the
ECFA and arguing that it will cause job losses in Taiwan and lead to an influx
of Chinese agricultural products and laborers in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>However, the government is promoting the ECFA as means by which Taiwan  could
avoid marginalization  in the region and obtain preferential tariff treatment
for its exports to China.</P>

      <P>The presentation entitled "Spring Riot" will be staged in Taipei until April 25

      <P>Huang Yi, one of the young choreographers who took second place in the Cross
Connection Ballet 3rd International  Choreography Competition (CCBC) in Denmark
earlier this month, will present "Floating Domain" based on his award-winning
piece "Whisper".</P>
      <P>"The 20-minute piece is actually a reflection  of my own feelings," he said.</P>
      <P>The piece depicts an imagined relationship between people's emotions and the
space around them. When the dancers are sad, the space around them expands, but
the dancers can feel themselves getting smaller and more lonely, Huang said..</P>
      <P>Another choreographer, Cheng Tsung-lung, will present a 30-minute piece called
"Crack."</P>
      <P>"It is called 'Crack', but actually I want to show cohesion, " Cheng said. "It
is a search for a solution to close and seal all the cracks."</P>
      <P>The third choreographer Ku Ming-shen said her piece "Endless Shore "challenges
the dancers." In addition to displaying their skills, the dancers are encouraged
to transmit overtones", Ku said.</P>

      <P>The Cabinet-level Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) announced
Wednesday that it will set up a Web site in few weeks time to make real estate
information more transparent, as part of the government's efforts to curb rising
housing prices.</P>
      <P>Within three months of the Web site's launch, information on real estate
appraisals and property transactions will be posted to prevent inflated
valuations by private institutions and consequently higher market prices, the
CEPD said.</P>
      <P>The CEPD plan was announced after the Financial Supervisory Commission and the
Central Bank of the Republic of China (Taiwan) unveiled various measures to tamp
down on exorbitant housing prices by strengthening  financial supervision  of
loans for property purchase.</P>
      <P>The FSC earlier this year stepped up checks on financial institutions and banks
that approve an excessively high percentage of housing and construction loans.</P>
      <P>The action was taken to ensure that the lending institutions comply with
regulations on internal control and risk management. The FSC is also asking
banks to provide more information on their home loans and interest rates.</P>
      <P>In keeping with the government's policy to tighten loan risk management, the
central bank said Wednesday that it will conduct a full-scale investigation into
banks' home loan policies.</P>
      <P>The central bank will ask lending institutions to show data such as loan-to-
value ratios, loan-to-income ratios, interest rates, and grace periods in real
estate loans to investors.</P>
      <P>The government's efforts to cool down the housing market were welcomed in the
construction sector.</P>
      <P>Pan Chun-jung, chairman of the Taiwan Regional Engineering Contractors'

the general public.</P>
      <P>"How many people can afford to buy a house that costs as much as NT$2 million
per ping (3.31 square meters)?" he asked.</P>
      <P>Houses should be sold at prices that most people can afford because the economy

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih said Wednesday the Executive Yuan will step up efforts to
drive home the essence of a proposed trade pact with China in order to win wider
public support for the initiative.</P>
      <P>In an interview  with a cable  TV station,  Wu discounted speculations that the
government's plan to sign a cross-Taiwan Strait economic cooperation framework
agreement (ECFA) may adversely affect the ruling party's performance in the
year-end mayoral elections in two southern Taiwan municipalities.</P>
      <P>"There is no direct link between the ECFA and the mayoral elections," Wu
contended in the interview.</P>
      <P>He admitted that the government could do more to gain wider public support for
the ECFA initiative, as the results of a series of public opinion polls show
that the majority of people in the three southern counties of Yunlin, Chiayi and
Tainan are opposed to the trade pact.</P>
      <P>In comparison, public support for the ECFA in the northern and central parts of
the country is high, but in the southern counties of Kaohsiung and Pingtung
public opinion on the issue is evenly split, he said.</P>
      <P>According  to Wu,  this is due to three main reasons -- insufficient effort by
the government to promote the ECFA, misleading of the grassroots people by
opposition groups, and comparatively slow infrastructure development in southern
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>On the opposition Democratic Progressive Party's demand for the Presidential
Office to provide information about the "early harvest" list for tariff waivers
that will form the backbone of the ECFA, Wu said no such a document is available
at the moment because the ECFA negotiations are still in progress.</P>
      <P>Describing the ECFA as a rose bush, Wu said the government has been working hard
to prevent the thorns from hurting Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"We will make every possible effort to minimize the adverse effects of the ECFA,
" Wu said.</P>
      <P>However, an estimated 80,000 local people may suffer as a result of the "early
harvest"  list of items proposed by China for concessionary tariff treatment, he
added.</P>
      <P>"We are still working hard to keep that number as low as possible," he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Health minister asked to showcase H1N1 efforts</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice Premier Eric Liluan Chu asked Health Minister Yaung Chih-liang Wednesday to
showcase Taiwan's successful fight against the outbreak of influenza A (H1N1) to
the international community.</P>
      <P>Chu gave the instructions at a press conference at which he described Taiwan's
anti-H1N1 drive as one of the most successful in the world.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan has been on par with advanced countries in terms of fighting the
epidemic, judging from its high inoculation rate and low fatality rate," Chu
said, adding that "the health minister should use the coming World Health
Assembly (WHA) and other international occasions to showcase the country's
achievement."</P>
      <P>Yaung is scheduled to represent Taiwan as an observer at May's WHA.</P>
      <P>Chu said that the fatality rate for H1N1 in Taiwan was only one-third the
average of Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)
countries, and was the third lowest among all OECD members and observers.</P>
      <P>The percent of Taiwanese people vaccinated against the virus was the fifth
highest in the world, and its immunization rates for medical and disease
prevention personnel, and elementary and junior high school  students  ranked
first and second,  respectively, highlighting the success of the drive that
began last November, Chu said.</P>
      <P>In terms of the safety of the vaccines, the ratio of those vaccinated who have
had undesired side effects was lower than the global average; and 39 of the 46
post-vaccination death cases have been proven unrelated to the vaccines, Chu
said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Director-General
Steve H. S. Kuo reiterated that the controversial death of a seven-year-old boy
in Taichung City was because of hemophagocytic syndrome, a blood disorder,
caused by B19 parvovirus.</P>
      <P>At a press conference, Kuo was responding to yet another question raised by the
boy's father, a genealogist surnamed Liu, on an opinion page in a local
newspaper that same day.</P>
      <P>Liu has frequently questioned whether his son's death was closely related to a
locally produced H1N1 vaccine he received weeks before he died.</P>
      <P>Kuo said that results  of pathological  tests  by several institutes, including
the Ministry of Justice's Institute of Forensic Medicine (IFM) and the U.S. CDC
all pointed to parvovirus as the cause of the boy's death.</P>
      <P>Yaung said that the national anti-H1N1 drive cost the government NT$8.6 billion
(US$276 million), compared to NT$25 billion that was earmarked for the outbreak
of SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) in 2003, not to mention the surplus
8 billion doses of H1N1 vaccines and other anti-influenza medicines that could
be used in case of another outbreak of the disease.</P>

      <P>Renowned cellist Yo-Yo Ma and the Silk Road Ensemble arrived in Taipei Wednesday
for a performance tour of three cities from April 22-25.</P>
      <P>They will also hold two workshops at which they will share their experience and
expertise with local musicians. One of the workshops is geared specifically
toward young people in the 12-18 age group.</P>
      <P>The concerts, to be held in Taipei, Taichung and Kaohsiung, will feature a
repertoire that includes Ahmet Adnan Saygun: Partita, Opus 31, Allegretto;
Persian Traditional: Ascending Bird; and Chinese Traditional: White Snow in the
Sunny Spring.</P>
      <P>Ma started The Silk Road Project, a non-profit artistic, cultural and
educational organization, 10 years ago.</P>
      <P>"During this time, we have been to Taiwan, Korean, Egypt and many other
countries. In these travels, we feel more part of the world and more human," Ma
said at a press conference Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The aim of the project is to promote innovation and learning through the arts,
he said.</P>
      <P>"The best students are teachers, the best teachers are students, and I think
that the best thing is to share our passions, " Ma said.</P>
      <P>The Silk Road Ensemble was established with the participation of internationally
renowned performers and composers from more than 20 countries. The instrumental
voices include piano, violin, pipa, erhu and many others.</P>
      <P>According to the ensemble, the goals of its virtuoso musicians are to nurture
global connections while maintaining the integrity of art rooted in an authentic
tradition.</P>
      <P>One of the ensemble members, Chinese musician Wu Tong who plays the sheng and
bawu, said the experience of working with Ma since 2000 has changed his life.</P>
      <P>According to Wu, he was rock singer but after he met Ma he started to try
different genres of music. In the process, he learned about tolerance and
understanding, he said.</P>
      <P>Wu also thanked Taiwan for sending medical and relief aid to the quake-affected
area of Qinghai in China. He promised to bring the best quality music to the
people of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The concerts will be held at National Concert Hall, Taipei April 22; Fulfill
Amphitheatre, Taichung April 24; and at Jhihde Hall, Kaohsiung April 25.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan ready to embrace trade pact with China: president</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President and ruling Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou said Wednesday that
the government has readied itself to deal with the impact of a planned trade
pact with China on local industry and workers.</P>
      <P>To mitigate the possible negative effects of the cross-Taiwan Strait economic
cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) on some local industries and their
workers, the government is planning to earmark a budget of NT$95 billion
(US$3.03 billion) over a 10-year period to serve that end, Ma told reporters
after a weekly meeting of the KMT's policy-making Central Standing Committee.</P>
      <P>Citing a study by the Chung-Hua Institution  for Economic Research, Ma said the
tariff-concession trade pact would help create 260,000 jobs for Taiwanese
workers although it would also affect some 80,000 people.</P>
      <P>"This does not mean that 80,000 workers would lose their jobs, rather, it means
that their salaries or benefits might contract," he explained.</P>
      <P>According to an assessment made by the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) , 17
traditional sectors, such as towels, garments, bedding, and Chinese herbal
medicine, would become vulnerable if the two sides ink the trade agreement,
which aim to eliminate tariffs, he pointed out.</P>
      <P>But Ma stressed:  "There  will  be more  advantages  than disadvantages if the
trade deal is put in place."</P>
      <P>"Should we fail to sign the ECFA with China, a lot more companies would be
forced to relocate to other countries and more workers would lose their jobs,"
Ma said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and China are slated to hold the next round of ECFA talks in May or June
in China. Both sides have reiterated their resolve to clinch the agreement the
sooner the better.</P>
      <P>The two sides have tried hard to arrive at an "early harvest list" which will
contain items of trade that will enjoy immediate tariff reduction or elimination
after the agreement is signed.</P>
      <P>Ma said signing a trade agreement with China is particularly significant  to
Taiwan as it will make Taiwanese  goods more competitive in the vast Chinese
market amid fierce competition from countries in the region after China forms a
zero-tariff "ASEAN plus one" free trade area with countries in Southeast Asia
this year.</P>

      <P>A young Taiwanese cosmetics artist won the coveted top prize at the
International Make-Up Artist Trade Show (IMAT) in Vancouver, Canada last Sunday.</P>
      <P>"It came as a big surprise to me," a jubilant Cheng Wei-ying said in a telephone
interview with the Central News Agency Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Cheng, an information and mass communications graduate of Yuan Ze University in
northern Taiwan's Taoyuan County, is studying makeup design at the Vancouver
Film School. She was the school's first student of Chinese descent to receive
the top award in an IMAT contest. The award carried a cash prize of 1,000
Canadian dollars.</P>
      <P>The IMAT is held five times per year -- in London, Toronto, Vancouver, Los
Angeles and Sydney -- and the contest is open to students and those who have
graduated for less than a year.</P>
      <P>In the final event in the contest, Cheng said that each participant was required
to demonstrate their creativity and make-up skills on a selected model using
themes from the Brothers Grimm fairy tales. Each contestant had three hours to
perform complete makevoers on the model's body, hair and face.</P>
      <P>The 24-year-old cosmetics artist said her entry was based on the tale of "The
Frog Prince" and infused with a sense of modernity.</P>
      <P>"I tried to convey a sense of solitude by styling the model into a cursed prince
who projected an ugly image but possessed a kind heart," Cheng explained.</P>
      <P>Finalists only had three weeks to prepare and assemble materials needed for
their creation, Cheng said.</P>
      <P>"I spent one week sewing a special jacket to be worn by the model and I spent
more than 1,000 Canadian dollars purchasing cosmetics materials, " she recalled.</P>
      <P>She only learned about patches to be pasted on the model's face 10 minutes
before the start of the contest. "Such an arrangement was aimed at testing the
contestant's sensitivity," she said, adding that she had to dye the hair on the
patches before pasting them on the model during the contest.</P>
      <P>Cheng has only studied cosmetics in Canada for a year. "I take great interest in
cosmetics as the human body is the most fascinating canvas for painting and the
feel of painting on the human body is beyond imagination," she added.</P>
      <P>After winning the first international prize of her career, Cheng said she still
has a long way to go to realize her dream of becoming an outstanding make-up
artist.</P>
      <P>"I would not hesitate to travel far to do makeup for somebody and to help
realize his or her dream, " Cheng said, adding that she hopes her creativity and
cosmetics work can help draw world attention to Taiwan.</P>

      <P>Participants expressed their views on whether Taiwan should continue or abolish
the death penalty as they pitted themselves against each other in the first of
four public hearings on the controversial issue Wednesday.</P>
      <P>National Taiwan University Professor Lee Mao-sheng, who supports the abolishment
of capital punishment, said the execution of death row inmates has not achieved
the purpose of deterring crime.</P>
      <P>Lee argued that as it is impossible to avoid miscarriages of justice, once a
death penalty inmate is executed, the dead cannot be revived.</P>
      <P>However, Lin Chih-chieh, assistant professor of National Chiao Tung University,
who is opposed to abolishing or conditional scrapping of the death penalty, said
the quality of judicial judgment should be upgraded to deal with the problem of
wrongful convictions.</P>
      <P>Also, Lin said capital punishment should not be carried out in "closed-door
operations," but that legal proceedings and execution proceedings should be made
public.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a group concerned about crime victims' rights asked whether anyone
who supports abolishing the death penalty have family members who have been
murdered, and have had experience dealing with that excruciating pain.</P>
      <P>Sociologist Chu Hai-yuan said that the government's protection of crime victims
is not enough, and that effective protection should be a good policy.</P>
      <P>Chu said the public should be educated on the cause of crime and the purpose of
punishment so as to effectively prevent crimes and increase protection and care
for the victims and their families.</P>
      <P>The issue of whether Taiwan should abolish the death penalty came to the fore
recently when Taiwan's former Minister of Justice Wang Ching-feng openly stated
her objections to the death penalty and her refusal to approve any executions as
minister. Her statements led to public criticism, especially by victims'
families and opposition legislators. Wang later resigned.</P>
      <P>New Justice Minister Tseng Yung-fu has said he will approve the executions of
prisoners on death row if they exhaust the appeals process.</P>
      <P>In view of the controversial issue, the Ministry of Justice recently decided to
sponsor four public hearings to hear the public's opinion on the matter. The
hearing Wednesday was held in Banciao, Taipei County. Three others will be held
in Taichung, Kaohsiung and Hualien later.</P>
      <P>Justice Minister Tseng said Wednesday at the hearing that the ministry will read
through all the cases of the 44 inmates now on death row, and exhaust all relief
measures before carrying out capital punishment on them.</P>
      <P>"The execution of the death sentence will not drag to the end of this year,"
Tseng said.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Justice has not approved an execution since December 2005.</P>

      <P>Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) Chairwoman Wang Ju-hsuan rebutted rumors
Wednesday that a planned cross-Taiwan Strait economic cooperation framework
agreement (ECFA) will drive down wages in Taiwan to the same level as in China.</P>
      <P>Reporting at the weekly meeting of the policy-making Central Standing Committee
of the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) , Wang said this will not happen because Taiwan
has a higher quality workforce than China.</P>
      <P>Wang pointed out that wages have not dropped in Hong Kong, Singapore, Australia
or New Zealand, all of which have signed trade agreements with China.</P>
      <P>As matter of fact, in Hong Kong, the average monthly wage of workers in the
industry and service sectors rose from US$1,591 in 2003, when it signed a closer
economic partnership arrangement (CEPA) with China, to US$1,765 in 2008, she
said.</P>
      <P>In addition, during that five-year period, Hong Kong's jobless rate dropped from
7.9 percent to 3.6 percent, with the number of employed workers increasing from
3.19 million to 3.52 million, she noted.</P>
      <P>Yiin Chii-ming, a former economics minister and now a minister without
portfolio, said at a news conference Wednesday that the ECFA is meant to help
Taiwan companies maintain their operations at home and attract more
multinationals to set up hubs in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He urged southern Taiwan local government chiefs affiliated with the opposition
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) to cooperate with the central government in
selling the ECFA to the public.</P>
      <P>"They should hold sessions to help local residents gain a better understanding
of the agreement and its benefits, " Yiin said.</P>
      <P>Eight local government chiefs last week signed a joint pledge, denouncing the
ECFA and arguing that it will cause job losses in Taiwan and lead to an influx
of Chinese agricultural products and laborers in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>However, the government is promoting the ECFA as means by which Taiwan  could
avoid marginalization  in the region and obtain preferential tariff treatment
for its exports to China.</P>

      <P>Huang Yi, one of the young choreographers who took second place in the Cross

earlier this month, will present "Floating Domain" based on his award-winning
piece "Whisper".</P>
      <P>"The 20-minute piece is actually a reflection  of my own feelings," he said.</P>
      <P>The piece depicts an imagined relationship between people's emotions and the
space around them. When the dancers are sad, the space around them expands, but
the dancers can feel themselves getting smaller and more lonely, Huang said..</P>
      <P>Another choreographer, Cheng Tsung-lung, will present a 30-minute piece called
"Crack."</P>
      <P>"It is called 'Crack', but actually I want to show cohesion, " Cheng said. "It
is a search for a solution to close and seal all the cracks."</P>
      <P>The third choreographer Ku Ming-shen said her piece "Endless Shore "challenges
the dancers." In addition to displaying their skills, the dancers are encouraged
to transmit overtones", Ku said.</P>

      <P>The Cabinet-level Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) announced
Wednesday that it will set up a Web site in few weeks time to make real estate
information more transparent, as part of the government's efforts to curb rising
housing prices.</P>
      <P>Within three months of the Web site's launch, information on real estate
appraisals and property transactions will be posted to prevent inflated
valuations by private institutions and consequently higher market prices, the
CEPD said.</P>
      <P>The CEPD plan was announced after the Financial Supervisory Commission and the
Central Bank of the Republic of China (Taiwan) unveiled various measures to tamp
down on exorbitant housing prices by strengthening  financial supervision  of
loans for property purchase.</P>
      <P>The FSC earlier this year stepped up checks on financial institutions and banks
that approve an excessively high percentage of housing and construction loans.</P>
      <P>The action was taken to ensure that the lending institutions comply with
regulations on internal control and risk management. The FSC is also asking
banks to provide more information on their home loans and interest rates.</P>
      <P>In keeping with the government's policy to tighten loan risk management, the
central bank said Wednesday that it will conduct a full-scale investigation into
banks' home loan policies.</P>
      <P>The central bank will ask lending institutions to show data such as loan-to-
value ratios, loan-to-income ratios, interest rates, and grace periods in real
estate loans to investors.</P>
      <P>The government's efforts to cool down the housing market were welcomed in the
construction sector.</P>
      <P>Pan Chun-jung, chairman of the Taiwan Regional Engineering Contractors'
Association, said high housing prices are not in the interest of businesses or
the general public.</P>
      <P>"How many people can afford to buy a house that costs as much as NT$2 million
per ping (3.31 square meters)?" he asked.</P>
      <P>Houses should be sold at prices that most people can afford because the economy

      <P>Chao Li-yun, who earlier in the day presided over a meeting to screen two
education bills that would pave the way for local universities and colleges to
accept Chinese students, fainted and was rushed to National Taiwan University
Hospital after a brawl broke out between ruling Kuomintang and DPP lawmakers.</P>
      <P>President Ma urged DPP Chairperson Tsai Ying-wen not to condone her party's
disruption of legislative proceedings.</P>
      <P>Ma said the lawmakers could certainly express their opinions, but should do so
rationally.</P>
      <P>KMT Policy Committee Director Lin Yi-shih said Chao suffered multiple bruises
and that she is weak and would have to stay in the hospital.</P>
      <P>The Presidential Office on Wednesday also urged Tsai to restrain DPP members.</P>
      <P>Presidential Office spokesman Lo Chih-chiang said that Tsai has touted
rationality and respect for democracy, and that she should practice what she
preaches.</P>
      <P>On her part, Tsai said the KMT was acting "rashly."</P>
      <P>She said that if the acceptance of Chinese academic credentials was not
involved, then it would be good to exchange students or open school courses to
Chinese so that students could have more contact with their counterparts across
the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>But if accreditation is involved, Taiwan should conduct a "cautious assessment,"
Tsai said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Premier vows to drive home benefits of ECFA to win public support</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 21 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih said Wednesday the Executive Yuan will step up efforts to
drive home the essence of a proposed trade pact with China in order to win wider
public support for the initiative.</P>
      <P>In an interview  with a cable  TV station,  Wu discounted speculations that the
government's plan to sign a cross-Taiwan Strait economic cooperation framework
agreement (ECFA) may adversely affect the ruling party's performance in the
year-end mayoral elections in two southern Taiwan municipalities.</P>
      <P>"There is no direct link between the ECFA and the mayoral elections," Wu
contended in the interview.</P>
      <P>He admitted that the government could do more to gain wider public support for
the ECFA initiative, as the results of a series of public opinion polls show
that the majority of people in the three southern counties of Yunlin, Chiayi and
Tainan are opposed to the trade pact.</P>
      <P>In comparison, public support for the ECFA in the northern and central parts of
the country is high, but in the southern counties of Kaohsiung and Pingtung
public opinion on the issue is evenly split, he said.</P>
      <P>According  to Wu,  this is due to three main reasons -- insufficient effort by
the government to promote the ECFA, misleading of the grassroots people by
opposition groups, and comparatively slow infrastructure development in southern
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>On the opposition Democratic Progressive Party's demand for the Presidential
Office to provide information about the "early harvest" list for tariff waivers
that will form the backbone of the ECFA, Wu said no such a document is available
at the moment because the ECFA negotiations are still in progress.</P>
      <P>Describing the ECFA as a rose bush, Wu said the government has been working hard
to prevent the thorns from hurting Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"We will make every possible effort to minimize the adverse effects of the ECFA,
" Wu said.</P>
      <P>However, an estimated 80,000 local people may suffer as a result of the "early
harvest"  list of items proposed by China for concessionary tariff treatment, he
added.</P>
      <P>"We are still working hard to keep that number as low as possible," he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Health minister asked to showcase H1N1 efforts</HEADLINE>

(By Chen Li-ting &amp; Bear Lee)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice Premier Eric Liluan Chu asked Health Minister Yaung Chih-liang Wednesday to
showcase Taiwan's successful fight against the outbreak of influenza A (H1N1) to
the international community.</P>
      <P>Chu gave the instructions at a press conference at which he described Taiwan's
anti-H1N1 drive as one of the most successful in the world.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan has been on par with advanced countries in terms of fighting the
epidemic, judging from its high inoculation rate and low fatality rate," Chu
said, adding that "the health minister should use the coming World Health
Assembly (WHA) and other international occasions to showcase the country's
achievement."</P>
      <P>Yaung is scheduled to represent Taiwan as an observer at May's WHA.</P>
      <P>Chu said that the fatality rate for H1N1 in Taiwan was only one-third the
average of Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)
countries, and was the third lowest among all OECD members and observers.</P>
      <P>The percent of Taiwanese people vaccinated against the virus was the fifth
highest in the world, and its immunization rates for medical and disease
prevention personnel, and elementary and junior high school  students  ranked
first and second,  respectively, highlighting the success of the drive that
began last November, Chu said.</P>
      <P>In terms of the safety of the vaccines, the ratio of those vaccinated who have
had undesired side effects was lower than the global average; and 39 of the 46
post-vaccination death cases have been proven unrelated to the vaccines, Chu
said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Director-General
Steve H. S. Kuo reiterated that the controversial death of a seven-year-old boy
in Taichung City was because of hemophagocytic syndrome, a blood disorder,
caused by B19 parvovirus.</P>
      <P>At a press conference, Kuo was responding to yet another question raised by the
boy's father, a genealogist surnamed Liu, on an opinion page in a local
newspaper that same day.</P>
      <P>Liu has frequently questioned whether his son's death was closely related to a
locally produced H1N1 vaccine he received weeks before he died.</P>
      <P>Kuo said that results  of pathological  tests  by several institutes, including
the Ministry of Justice's Institute of Forensic Medicine (IFM) and the U.S. CDC
all pointed to parvovirus as the cause of the boy's death.</P>
      <P>Yaung said that the national anti-H1N1 drive cost the government NT$8.6 billion
(US$276 million), compared to NT$25 billion that was earmarked for the outbreak
of SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) in 2003, not to mention the surplus
8 billion doses of H1N1 vaccines and other anti-influenza medicines that could
be used in case of another outbreak of the disease.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A proposed amendment to the Personal Data Protection Act recently passed its
second reading in the Legislative Yuan.  The most controversial aspect of the
bill is a clause requiring the media and elected public officials to obtain the
consent of individuals before publicizing any information about them.</P>
      <P>We urge the legislature to drop this bill before the third reading. If it is
passed, it would be an unconstitutional law that could destroy Taiwan's hard-won
freedom of speech and of the press.</P>
      <P>According to the bill, the media will not be allowed to seek by any means
information  about the private  or social lives of individuals. This would leave
the media with very little to report. Even worse, the bill does not specify
whether the individuals it is seeking to protect are ordinary people or
government officials.</P>
      <P>Under the controversial clause, all information about individuals is designated
as private. However, it overlooks the fact that privacy is not an infinite or
absolute right.</P>
      <P>It is evident that the architects of the bill have no idea that there are
different rights pertaining to people's privacy and reputations.</P>
      <P>In media reporting, a person's privacy can only be violated if the information
is accurate. Therefore, if all information about individuals is considered
private and off limits to the media, there can be no accurate news stories, in
which case all the media outlets will have to shut down.</P>
      <P>We could not believe our eyes when we saw the bill and we wished that our
interpretation of it was incorrect. Can the Ministry of Justice and the
Legislative Yuan please tell us if we have read the bill correctly? (April 22,

    <HEADLINE>United Daily News: Reform and opening needed in Taiwan</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>04/22/10  12:47:35
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>"Reform and opening" was one of the late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping's
trademark slogans. We must say that Taiwan needs reform and opening now. In
particular, we are saying this to the opposition Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP).</P>
      <P>At a time when it has become totally impossible to bar people and capital from
flowing outward, the country has been throwing up various blockades to the
inflow of external resources. This is the true crisis in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>A case in point is the dispute over whether to open Taiwan to Chinese students.
It is impossible to bar Taiwanese students from going to China, but the DPP is
trying to block Chinese students from coming to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The DPP's objection to the signing of an economic cooperation framework
agreement (ECFA) with China is another example. Even as Taiwanese resources
continue to flow outward, there are fewer incentives for Taiwanese and foreign
businesses to keep their roots in Taiwan. But Taiwan has been shutting out
Chinese capital.</P>
      <P>Opening up will inevitably cause pain. However, unless Taiwan does so, it will
have no means of sharpening its competitiveness or continuing to attract global
resources.</P>
      <P>A closed-door policy is unfeasible. This is especially true when its comes to a
policy that shuts off the entry of resources, but not the exit. The DPP's
closed-door policy will serve only to increase the flow of Taiwanese students
and capital to China. (April 22, 2010)</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taichung mayor rules out possibility of presidential bid</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  April 22 (CNA)
04/22/10  12:58:09
(By Charles Kang and Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Jason Hu, mayor of the central Taiwan city of Taichung who once served as
Taiwan's foreign minister, has ruled out the possibility of running for
president either in 2012 or 2016.</P>
      <P>"It is out of the question." he said in an interview published in Thursday's
Chinese-language Lianhe Zaobao.</P>
      <P>"The Kuomintang should focus on rallying behind President Ma Ying-jeou to secure
his reelection in 2012." said the mayor, who is widely seen as a possible KMT
presidential candidate should Ma's low popularity preclude a second term.</P>
      <P>Obviously irritated by the interviewer's repeated questions on the possibility
of him making a presidential bid, Hu snapped, "I have already told you three
times that it is out of the question, how can I get this across to you."</P>
      <P>According to the paper, Hu is considered as one of the KMT's most prominent
leaders, along with President Ma and Vice Premier Eric Li-luan Chu, but the
mayor prefers to remain in his current post than to serve in the central
government.</P>
      <P>Lianhe Zaobao said that Hu's popularity is hard to explain because while he
doesn't bungle his job, his performance is not exactly brilliant. The level of
support he enjoys in southern Taiwan, which is a traditional stronghold of the
opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), is quite unusual, it noted.</P>
      <P>Hu's popularity has raised hopes among KMT supporters that he might run instead
of Ma on the KMT ticket in the 2012 presidential election, given Ma's poor
showing in various public opinion surveys.</P>
      <P>The mayor's supporters have maintained high expectations of him, even after he
suffered a mild stroke a few years ago.</P>
      <P>In February, they erected a huge billboard in Taichung City that reads "Support
to the hilt for Jason Hu as the 2012 presidential candidate."</P>
      <P>It forced Hu to scramble to nip the idea in the bud by stating his position
publicly.</P>
      <P>In the interview with Lianhe Zaobao, he praised Ma and downplayed his own
popularity.</P>
      <P>"You can hardly find anyone who is more honest and diligent in his work than Ma,
" the mayor said. "There are many factors that have contributed to his low
approval ratings at the moment, but there is no guarantee that I would be more
popular than him in a presidential election."</P>
      <P>"The KMT cannot afford divisions at this time, nor can it field a better
candidate than Ma Ying-jeou, so I am throwing my weight behind him with all my
heart and I urge all party members to do the same, " Hu said.</P>
      <P>He also entreated the KMT to stop flirting with the dangerous idea of swapping
horses in midstream.</P>
      <P>"The KMT's only option is to pull out all the stops to boost Ma's popularity and
win the (2012) election," he said.</P>
      <P>"There is no question of anyone within the KMT challenging Ma for the
presidential candidacy in 2012," he said.</P>
      <P>Hu, who will run for the first mayor of a new municipality that will be created
later this year by merging Taichung city and county, said the KMT is likely to
retain control in three of five such new municipalities and hopefully will win
another one or two.</P>
      <P>"We expect to win in the cities of Taipei, Xinbei and Taichung, and are not
ruling out victories in the cities of Tainan and Kaohsiung."</P>
      <P>Lianhe Zaobao said Hu is a shoo-in for Taichung mayor but the KMT candidates in
Taipei and Xinbei will face a stiffer challenge from the DPP candidates.</P>
      <P>In the interview, which was conducted in Taichung on April 19, the mayor
emphasized that Taiwan's power lies not in its armed forces but in its well-
developed democracy and economy.</P>
      <P>"Democracy has earned the country credit while its economy gives it the power to
engage other states."</P>
      <P>Hu, who served as foreign minister between 1997 and 1999, said Taiwan's
relations with China and the United States are the best ever at the moment, and
Taiwan is mending fences with Singapore.</P>

      <P>Taiwanese singer and Internet sensation Lin Yu-chun wowed audiences Wednesday
with his impeccable rendition of Whitney Houston's version of "I Will Always
Love You" on the Ellen DeGeneres Show.</P>
      <P>The talk show host exclaimed "unbelievable" several times as she expressed her
admiration  for what was called Lin's amazingly beautiful rendition of the song
that was written by Dolly Parton and made famous by Whitney Houston.</P>
      <P>At the end of his performance, during which he sang also "Amazing Grace," the
studio audience gave Lin a standing ovation.</P>
      <P>Wearing his trademark shirt, vest and a bow tie, Lin performed a short dance
piece at the start of his appearance on the Ellen DeGeneres Show.</P>
      <P>The 24-year-old told DeGeneres that he was inspired by the success story of
Susan Boyle, a Scottish singer who came to international attention when she
appeared as a contestant on the TV show Britain's Got Talent in April 2009,
singing "I Dreamed a Dream" from Les Miserables.</P>
      <P>Lin vaulted to fame after a video showing him singing "I Will Always Love You"
was posted on YouTube April 6. The clip, from his performance on a Taiwan talent
show "Million Star, " immediately went viral, propelling him to worldwide
stardom.</P>
      <P>Lin, who weighs 110 kg and is nicknamed "fatty, " admitted on the talk show that
he had been bullied during his childhood because of his weight.</P>
      <P>Prompted to offer some advice to other children who may be facing the same
problem, Lin said, "There is a reason for everyone's existence. Be confident.
The best way to get back at them (bullies) is to be more successful than they
are".</P>
      <P>DeGeneres endorsed Lin's advice, putting her arm around his shoulders and
saying, "that's the best revenge."</P>
      <P>Lin's popularity is such that he was recognized by some tourists in the famous
Hollywood shopping center "The Grove." Some of them approached him and asked to
take photos with him, while others asked whether he was the person who sang "I
Will Always Love You" in the YouTube video.</P>
      <P>TMZ, a popular celebrity news Web site, posted an article Wednesday introducing
Lin as "the Taiwanese, male Whitney Houston."</P>
      <P>Lin has also been interviewed for the Wednesday edition of the Lopez Tonight
talk show. On the show, he sang "Saving All My Love For You, " another of
Houston's hits, and performed Bonnie Tyler's "Total Eclipse of the Heart" in a
duet with Canadian actor, recording artist, and author William Shatner.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet recently decided to merge the government's statistics and accounting
units in more than 20 government agencies as part of a government restructuring
project. With the long existing shortage of resources in the country's
statistics department, this decision is tantamount to declaring that Taiwan will
soon have no trustworthy national statistics.</P>
      <P>Once the statistics and accounting units are merged,  the compilation of
macroeconomics data such as export orders, industrial production, and retail
surveys is bound to stop. Even if the work does continue, the quality of the
statistics will be worrisome.</P>
      <P>Inaccurate figures will result in miscalculations of the economic situation,
which can steer the economy toward disaster.</P>
      <P>It is inconceivable that our government restructuring efforts are now trying to
put accounting and statistics, widely known to be two totally different
disciplines, under one roof.</P>
      <P>In countries such as the United States, Japan, South Korea and China,  an
increasing level of importance is being placed on departments of statistics. In
comparison, is Taiwan making the right decision on this issue? We urge President
Ma Ying-jeou and Premier Wu Den-yih to pay special attention to this matter.

    <HEADLINE>Talk of the day -- Scuffles over opening to Chinese students</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>04/22/10  13:59:59
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislators brawled Wednesday over draft amendments to two education laws that
would pave the way for local universities and colleges to recruit Chinese
students.</P>
      <P>Clashes broke out when opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) lawmakers
stormed the podium to prevent two clerks from announcing the agenda of a
committee hearing on draft amendments to the University Act and the College Act.
DPP lawmakers also attempted to block Education Minister Wu Ching-ji from
delivering a briefing on the amendment proposals.</P>
      <P>The scuffles turned into a free-for-all, with DPP legislators pushing KMT
Legislator Chao Li-yun, who was chairing the session of the Legislative Yuan's
Education and Culture Committee.</P>
      <P>Chao, who was sweating and having difficulty breathing, fainted after she
announced that the two bills had completed their first review and were to be
referred to the full legislature for further deliberation.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from local media coverage of the issue:</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>Presidents and vice presidents of more than 100 local colleges and universities
witnessed the fracas at the legislature over an issue that is of crucial
importance to the development of Taiwan's institutes of higher education.</P>
      <P>Chen Tai-jan, a deputy president at National Taiwan University, said the fight
did not solve problems, but only deepened rifts. "It served as a bad example,"
he said.</P>
      <P>During the scuffles, DPP Legislator Kuan Bi-ling displayed an e-mail from the
secretariat of a college association that suggested nine university presidents
who voiced public support for the amendments a day earlier felt pressured to do
so by the Ministry of Education (MOE) because they receive subsidies from the
ministry.</P>
      <P>Dismissing Kuan's allegation, Chen said university executives do not need to be
"mobilized" because opening to Chinese students involves the globalization of
Taiwan's system of higher education and will increase its international
competitiveness.</P>
      <P>On DPP legislator complaints that Wu was "sacrificing Taiwan's next generation
only to kiss Beijing's ass, " Chen Chen-kuei, president of Ling Tung University,
said: "Our democratization is what they (the Chinese people) crave. We are
influencing them, not falling victim to any 'united front' scheme." (April 22,
2010).</P>
      <P>The Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>The amendment proposals, which appear only to lead to the opening of Taiwan's
universities and colleges to some 2,000 Chinese students a year, will probably
end up infringing on Taiwan students' rights to education and Taiwan people's
opportunities for work.</P>
      <P>"Tilting toward China" -- reflected in the MOE's pushing for the amendment
proposals -- is the real motive behind this and it is something Taiwan society
should worry about.</P>
      <P>Taking Hong Kong as an example, Martin Oei, a Hong Kong-based news commentator,
has warned that allowing Chinese students to enter Taiwan to study is tantamount
to surrendering to China. He said the opening would not just trigger problems
such as work opportunities for Taiwan's people and controversies over fake
academic credentials, but would also involve Taiwan's national security. (April
22, 2010).</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>A survey by this daily on Wednesday found that 47 percent of respondents agreed
with the government conditionally opening Taiwan's doors to Chinese students,
while 39 percent opposed it.</P>
      <P>Forty percent of the respondents said "yes" to a question asking whether Taiwan
should recognize academic credentials issued by Chinese institutes, and 43
percent said "no."</P>
      <P>The poll results also showed that 44 percent of the respondents think Taiwan
universities are better than their Chinese counterparts academically. Only 15
percent consider China's higher education of a higher standard than Taiwan's.</P>
      <P>A total of 787 adults were randomly selected for the survey. (April 22, 2010).</P>

      <P>Higher education does not guarantee a good job and vocational school graduates
are the "favorite" candidates in job interviews and in Taiwan's job market,
according to a survey by the 1111 Job Bank.</P>
      <P>Some 70 percent of business executives responding to the survey said they attach
importance to job seekers' educational backgrounds, saying the backgrounds
reflect the candidates' common sense, work attitude and professional capability,
the survey found.</P>
      <P>The executives were from the education sector,  government agencies, non-
governmental organizations, the medical, agricultural and husbandry sectors as
well as high-technology companies, in that order.</P>
      <P>Most companies in the service sector, however, said they don't care much about a
job seeker's educational background, according to the poll.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 75 percent of companies responding to the poll said they had hired
people whose educational backgrounds were not in line with requirements but had
great potential and work experience.</P>
      <P>The 1111 Job Bank conducted the poll online from April 4 to April 20 and
collected  340 valid  responses  from  companies  and organizations.</P>
      <P>Seventy-three percent of respondents said that when conducting interviews, they
do not necessarily hire applicants with the highest education backgrounds.
Respondents said they did not do so because people with high educational
backgrounds tend to think highly of themselves and give themselves airs and
graces, according to the poll.</P>
      <P>On statistics suggesting that the more education people have, the more likely
they are to be unemployed, respondents attributed the phenomenon to several
factors, with the most common being: They have grandiose aims but little
ability.</P>
      <P>It was also found that business companies were most satisfied with staff members
holding diplomas from vocational  colleges, followed by university graduates.</P>
      <P>The vocational school graduates were the "favorite" workers because their
professional  capabilities  conform to their job requirements and they don't put
on airs, according to the survey.</P>

      <P>To help Taiwanese people overcome the language barrier during possible
emergencies while traveling abroad, bilingual cards have been made available at
Taoyuan and Kaohsiung international airports for travelers, the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Passengers can obtain the emergency aid cards free of cost at the airports'
information desks and at the check-in counters of China Airlines and Eva Air,
according to a MOFA press release.</P>
      <P>The phrases on the cards, in both Chinese and English, request help or
information. Some of them are "I am from Taiwan (ROC) , and cannot speak
English, I wonder if I could have a Chinese (Mandarin) interpreter;" and "If no
one is available, please contact the Taiwan Mission in your country, I need
their assistance."</P>
      <P>The MOFA said that if Taiwanese travelers encounter problems at customs or
immigration in other countries or find themselves in emergency  situations
abroad they can use the cards to seek assistance.</P>
      <P>At present, the Chinese-English cards are available in four versions  for travel
in Asia,  to North America,  Europe and Trans-Atlantic regions. The MOFA said is
planning to add other language versions for use in Central and South America and
Africa.</P>
      <P>The information on the cards includes a MOFA emergency contact number,
886-800-085-095, and the emergency contact numbers of several Taiwanese missions
abroad.</P>

    <HEADLINE>President stresses importance of disaster prevention</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou stressed the importance of disaster prevention as he
reviewed a rescue exercise in Kaohsiung County Thursday.</P>
      <P>Approximately  500  members  of the military,  police  and firefighting forces
cooperated with staff from public and private agencies in the exercise, which
took place in a riverside park under the Wanda Bridge in the county's Daliao
Township.</P>
      <P>According to Ma, the importance of disaster prevention and rescue has become
evident following severe devastation caused by Typhoon Morakot that left more
than 700 people dead or missing in southern Taiwan last August.</P>
      <P>Ma noted that natural disasters usually cannot be foreseen or resisted.
Earthquakes are unpredictable, he said, and preventive measures such as raising
the quake-resistance level of buildings should be in place to minimize the
impact of disasters.</P>
      <P>Forecasts are helpful when it comes to typhoons, however, and residents should
be properly evacuated before disaster occurs, the president said.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that more than 9,000 people were evacuated before Typhoon Morakot
hit Taiwan. Had these people not left their homes, at least 1,000 more could
have been killed, he said.</P>
      <P>Ma admitted that if the evacuation had been conducted earlier and more quickly,
the Morakot death toll could have been lower. He urged government agencies to
strengthen their coordination in preparation for disasters.</P>

      <P>The La New Bears placed relief pitcher Keng Po-hsuan on the injured list after
he burned his crotch in an accident at home, the team said in a press release
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Keng, who played Major League Baseball for a Toronto Blue Jays farm team from
2005 to 2008, suffered injury to his private parts "from boiling water, " the
team said without elaborating. He is expected to return in one to two weeks.</P>
      <P>The right-handed reliever, who returned to Taiwan and was selected by La New in
a Chinese Professional Baseball League (CPBL) special draft in 2009, appeared in
seven games this season and registered one win and two saves with a 1.00 earned
run average (ERA).</P>
      <P>Keng was not the first La New player to suffer such an injury. On Oct. 19, 2007,
one day before La New opened the best-of-seven Taiwan Series against the Uni-
President Lions, American pitcher Andrew Lorraine had a similar experience.</P>
      <P>Lorraine was watching a scouting DVD with a cup of coffee in his hands when he
was bumped by a teammate and spilled the scalding hot beverage on his lap.</P>
      <P>The former major leaguer, who was later released in 2008, still managed to play
in Game 2 as a reliever and started Game 4. La New eventually lost 4-3 in the
series.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan-educated student awarded Fulbright Ph.D scholarship</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A Taiwan-educated student has been awarded a U.S. State Department-funded
international Fulbright science and technology Ph.D scholarship and will enroll
in Stanford University this fall to study nanotechnology.</P>
      <P>Hsu Po-chun, 25, is the third Taiwan student to have won the scholarship, a
flagship international educational exchange program sponsored by the U.S.
government that is granted to 45 international students every year in the
science and technology category.</P>
      <P>This scholarship is regarded as special because Hsu,  who graduated from
National Tsing Hua University (NTHU) in 2007, was educated only in Taiwan and is
one of the few Taiwanese students to study for a Ph.D after earning only a
bachelor's degree, said Chen Tung-jung, executive officer of The Foundation for
Scholarly Exchange (Fulbright Taiwan) , one of some 50 bilateral organizations
in the world established specifically to administer the program outside the U.S.</P>
      <P>Hsu told CNA he was surprised to find out that he had been granted the three-
year, US$240,000 scholarship last October because he had failed his first bid in
2009.</P>
      <P>Hsu plans to focus on nanotechnology and would like to apply the results of his
research to the development  of solar energy, especially solar cells. He
expressed hope that he will be able to use what he learns in the U.S. to help
Taiwan's scientific development.</P>
      <P>Hsu, a researcher at Academia Sinica, Taiwan's top research institute, does not
fit the traditional perception of a "good student" in Taiwan as he does not want
to be a "nerd" who does nothing but study and conduct scientific experiments.</P>
      <P>As well as taking classes in psychology and journalism, he was also vice
president of the Student Association, chief executive of the organizing
committee of the locally renowned intercollegiate athletic games between NTHU
and National Chiao Tung University and volunteered to work in the emergency room
at Mackay Memorial Hospital in Hsinchu City.</P>
      <P>Just as he has taken the road less traveled in his research, Hsu's favorite
sport -- soccer -- is not popular in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"I appreciate my parents for always respecting me and letting me make decisions
for myself. They let me find the uniqueness of myself, rather than just
following the herd," he said.</P>
      <P>Hsu, who describes himself as a hard worker rather than a genius, said he has
only been to the U.S. once, when he was a small child, but added that the
experience of being an exchange student at China's Tsing Hua University in 2006
helped broaden his perspective.</P>
      <P>Most university students in China work very hard because of fierce peer
competition and a strong desire to succeed, he observed. Taiwan's college
students, on the other hand, tend to be more animated and creative, to be good
at integrating cross-disciplinary knowledge and are better at teamwork,
according to Hsu.</P>
      <P>"We should leverage these characteristics to gain advantages in cross-Taiwan
Strait competition, " he said.</P>
      <P>The Fulbright Program was established in 1946 under legislation introduced by
then-Senator J. William Fulbright of Arkansas. It is sponsored by the U.S.
Department of State's Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs.</P>
      <P>Approximately 294,000 "Fulbrighters " -- 111,000 from the U.S. and 183,000 from
other countries -- have participated in the program since its inception. The
program awards around 7,500 new grants annually and presently operates in over
155 countries.</P>
      <P>Over the past 50 years, Fulbright Taiwan has financed over 1,400 Taiwan
Fulbright grantees to the U.S. and more than 1,000 U.S. Fulbright grantees
coming to Taiwan.</P>

      <P>A priority "early harvest" list prepared by Taiwan as part of negotiations on an
economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) with China is more comprehensive
than China's, Minister of Economic Affairs Shih Yen-shiang said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Fielding questions from ruling Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator Lee Ching-hua at a
legislative committee meeting, Shih said the number of items and their total
export value to be put forward by the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) at the
negotiating table will certainly be higher than China's, based on a proportional
principle due to the difference in size of the two markets.</P>
      <P>Commenting on a local media report that Taiwan will present a list containing
300 to 500 items, far short of China's list of more than 700 items, Shih
described it as sheer speculation, while also pointing out that China has
repeatedly said that it will make more concessions concerning the "early harvest
lists" in the ECFA talks.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and China are slated to hold the next round of ECFA talks in May or June
in China. Both sides have reiterated their resolve to clinch the agreement the
sooner the better.</P>
      <P>The two sides have tried hard to arrive at an "early harvest list, " which will
contain items of trade that will enjoy immediate tariff reduction or elimination
after the agreement is signed.</P>
      <P>Turning to a proposal by the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) that
a referendum should be held to allow the public to decide the fate of the cross-
Taiwan Strait trade pact, Shih contended that it will not be necessary, as most
democratic governments around the world sign free trade  agreements  without
the need for referendums.</P>
      <P>"But whether or not a referendum should be called to serve that end must be
handled in line with the Referendum Law," he added.</P>
      <P>"The Executive Yuan is responsible for the ECFA, and will submit the accord to
the Legislative Yuan for screening once the deal is signed," Shih said.</P>

      <P>Vegetables and fruit from central Taiwan's Changhua County attracted  a lot of
attention  at a promotional event in Singapore Thursday, and organizers of the
event said they are planning to introduce more Taiwanese fruit and vegetables to
Singapore.</P>
      <P>About NT$8 million (US$253,968) -worth of mushrooms, grapes, guavas, carrots and
star fruit from the county -- one of Taiwan's main agricultural areas -- will be
sold by NTUC Fairprice, a leading Singapore supermarket chain and one of the
event organizers.</P>
      <P>NTUC Fairprice Managing Director Seah Kian Peng said most Singaporeans have a

cooperate with Taiwan in introducing more Taiwanese vegetables and fruit.</P>
      <P>Addressing the opening ceremony of the promotional campaign, Changhua Magistrate

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwanese yacht builders signed a letter of intent with the Kaohsiung city
government Thursday to increase their investment in Kaohsiung and take advantage
of plans that the city government has mapped out to facilitate  their
development.</P>
      <P>John Lu, founder and CEO of Horizon Yachts -- the largest yacht builder in Asia
and sixth-largest in the world -- and chairman of the Taiwan Yacht Industry
Association, signed the letter of intent on behalf of association members with
Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu.</P>
      <P>Lu said that although many Chinese cities, including Shanghai, Qingdao and
Shenzhen, have beckoned Taiwanese yacht builders with investment incentives, he
prefers keeping his company home in Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>"The Kaohsiung sail boat industry has its competitiveness as a cluster of
builders has been forming here," Lu said.</P>
      <P>Addressing the signing ceremony, Chen said the development of a yacht building
hub, to be named the Asia Luxury Sail Boat Development District, will be one of
the pivotal projects under the port city's endeavor to speed up its industrial
transition.</P>
      <P>The sail boat building district will be located on a 105-hectare tidal land area
to which the city government will allocate NT$5 billion (US$160 million) for
development, Chen said.</P>
      <P>She added that the yacht building district has also been included in a project
approved by the Executive Yuan to develop a new "ocean-and-air" town in
Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>Lu said that despite China's beckoning, he and other Taiwanese yacht builders
preferred to keep their roots in Kaohsiung because of the high-caliber manpower
in Taiwan and a well-established research, production, marketing and delivery
chain.</P>
      <P>"The Asia Luxury Sail Boat Development District to be developed in Kaohsiung
could become the most complete and competitive yacht building area in the
world," a confident Lu forecast.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's yacht industry is a 40-year veteran in the yacht building world, even
though yachting is non-existent in Taiwan due to restrictive regulations.</P>
      <P>He said Taiwan is the only country in the world in which yacht builders build
yachts on land, and the only yacht building country in the world in which
yachting has until recent years not been permitted.</P>
      <P>It is not impossible for Taiwan to turn into a yachting country if the
government lifts a ban on the development of marinas and yachting, and adds new
statutes governing yachting, Lu said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The legislative caucus of the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) decided Thursday to
postpone the third reading of amendments to the Personal Data Protection Act
amid fierce criticism from the local mass media.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lin Yi-shih, who is head of the KMT's policy committee, said the
leading members of the caucus, after consultation with Cabinet officials,
decided Friday to ask the plenary session of the legislature to postpone the
third reading of the bill.</P>
      <P>However, the legislature is expected to make a firm decision on the revisions at
its next plenary session on April 27, Lin said.</P>
      <P>The KMT lawmakers stalled the bill amid complaints in the media about a clause
that would require news organizations to obtain the consent of an individual
before they could publicize his or her personal information. This is seen likely
to cramp the operations of many publications and TV talk shows that have built
their business on sensational expose's.</P>
      <P>The controversy flared up Tuesday after the legislature's Organic Laws and
Statutes Committee decided to strike out a clause in the amendments that would
have exempted the media from the consent requirement.</P>
      <P>The mass-circulated China Times said in its editorial Thursday that the revised
bill is unconstitutional, and if it is passed it will ruin the country's hard-
earned freedom of the press and undermine President Ma's promise to protect
human rights.</P>
      <P>The editorial blasted the Ministry of Justice, which crafted the original
version of the amendments, and the legislature, which struck out the media
exemption clause, as the chief culprits in what it said was a bungled attempt to
protect pesonal data.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile Tan Cheng-hsiang,  director of the Legal Affairs Department under the
Ministry of the Justice said the revisions were aimed at protecting people's
personal information rather than limiting freedom of the press.</P>
      <P>The original intention was to exclude the mass media from the stipulation, but
this idea was opposed by the majority of people with whom the ministry
consulted, he added.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's economic growth could hit 5 percent this year judging from its
performance in the first quarter, Minister of Economic Affairs Shih Yen-shiang
said Thursday.</P>
      <P>"The better-than-expected growth of course has something to do with the proposed
economic cooperation framework agreement with China, " Shih said while fielding
questions from Kuomintang Legislator Lee Ching-hua at the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>The agreement, which is still under negotiation between Taipei and Beijing, is
expected by the Taiwanese side to be concluded in June.</P>
      <P>Citing Taiwan's boosted international trade and export orders, Shih said there
are increasing signs that the growth rate could hit 5 percent this year,
although the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics has
forecast only a 4.72 percent growth.</P>
      <P>Shih also declined to rule out the possibility of a 6.5 percent growth --
forecast by the International Monetary Fund -- saying that "it is not absolutely
impossible, but 5 percent is a very reasonable forecast for the time being."</P>

      <P>Taiwan's health authorities reported Thursday the country's fifth case of severe
enterovirus infection for this year, which involved a 9-month-old boy in
Kaohsiung County.</P>
      <P>The infant has been hospitalized since April 11 after coming down with a fever,
drowsiness, seizures and acute flaccid paralysis, according to Lin Ting,
director-general of the Centers for Disease Control (CDC).</P>
      <P>The patient, who is now in stable condition, was later diagnosed as having
contracted enterovirus type 71 (EV71) -- the deadliest type of the virus, Lin
said.</P>
      <P>Investigations show that the boy could have contracted the virus from his 34
-month-old brother, who was diagnosed with a minor enterovirus infection on
April 7 and has since recovered, Lin said.</P>
      <P>According to the official, severe complications can easily occur among children
under 3 years old who get infected by an older child in the family. This is
because younger children have weaker immunity and they are exposed to higher
levels of the virus than the first victims.</P>
      <P>CDC monitoring data show that 4.09 people out of every 1,000 patients seeking
emergency medical attention last week were suffering from enterovirus. The ratio
has reached the alert level, which falls within a range between 2.73 percent and
5.24 percent, the CDC said.</P>

      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih announced the launch of a low-carbon homeland program
Thursday as part of activities to mark the 40th anniversary of World Earth Day.</P>
      <P>"The program, under which two low-carbon model communities in each city and
county around the country will be built by 2011, epitomizes our determination to
march toward a low-carbon society, " Wu said at the launching  ceremony held by
the Cabinet-level Environmental Protection Administration (EPA).</P>
      <P>Highlights of the program also include developing six low-carbon cities by 2014
and completing four low-carbon living areas in northern, central, southern and
eastern Taiwan by 2020, Wu said.</P>
      <P>"The Earth we live on requires protection from each of us... I hope each
government agency, school and private corporation will fulfill its obligation as
a member of the global village by contributing to global environmental
protection," the premier added.</P>
      <P>Since World Earth Day was launched on April 22, 1970 to raise public awareness
of the importance of environmental protection, Wu noted, the pursuit of a
healthy and sustainable living environment has never ceased.</P>
      <P>Countries around the world are now working on measures to reduce carbon
emissions, in accordance with the resolutions reached at the United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change, in order to mitigate the impact of
global warming on living creatures on the Earth.</P>
      <P>In the face of this global trend, Wu said, the local population should step up
its environmental protection efforts.</P>
      <P>In response to the Earthday Network's A Billion Acts of Green campaign, the EPA
has launched a series of green programs aimed at urging local people to conserve
water resources, reduce carbon emissions and practice recycling, wildlife
conservation, environmental cleanup and sustainable development of the land.</P>
      <P>"We hope business groups and individual citizens will join forces with the
government in carrying out these programs," the premier urged.</P>
      <P>He also pointed out that the government's energy conservation campaign has
generated encouraging results, saving 7 billion kilwatt hours of electricity
last year and over the past few months, a volume of water equivalent to Taipei
City's total consumption for 29 days.</P>

      <P>ASUSTeK Computer Inc., one of Taiwan's prime computer producers, is optimistic
about its business prospects in the second quarter due to better-than-expected
performance in Q1, company executives said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Q1 revenue of ASUS totaled NT$74.807 billion (US$2.38 billion) , only a 6.24
percent drop from its Q4 revenue -- better than the previous forecast of a 10
percent - 20 percent contraction, ASUS ECO Jerry Shen said at a shareholder
meeting.</P>
      <P>The company's March revenue hit NT$31.715 billion, an increase of 56 percent
from February and a 71 percent year-on-year growth.</P>
      <P>Shen also forecast that the company's revenue will expand from quarter to
quarter this year, thanks to rebounding business around the world, particularly
in eastern Europe.</P>
      <P>Brushing aside speculation that an ash cloud from an erupting volcano in Iceland
might have affected its business in Europe, ASUS Chairman Stan Shih said the
impact of suspended European flights on the company's deliveries will be limited
as the company has raised its ratio of marine transport. Europe is the main
market for the computer firm.</P>
      <P>Shih also reiterated his resolve to make ASUS the world's third-largest computer
firm next year.</P>
      <P>ASUS is currently the world's No. 1 maker of motherboards, enjoying a 37 percent
stake in the global market. It aims to be putting out more than 50 percent of
the world's motherboards by 2014.</P>

      <P>The Orchestre Philharmonique de Radio France, one of the top orchestras in
Europe, will bring their distinctive sounds to Taiwan in May.</P>
      <P>The philharmonic, led by Korean-born conductor Myung-Whun Chung, will give two
concerts at the National Music Hall on May 7-8, according to an official of the
National Theater and Concert Hall (NTCH) Thursday.</P>
      <P>The 104-member group will tour Shanghai for Shanghai's World Expo at the end of
this month, and then come to Taipei to present the group's best repertoire --
French composer Joseph-Maurice Ravel's works.</P>
      <P>The orchestra is the first philharmonic created by French Radio in the 1930s,
and since May 2000 has been led by Chung, who has successfully raised the
performance of the group to a new level.</P>
      <P>The changes are reflected in the latest music reviews: one music critic had
indicated that he thought France did not currently have an orchestra which was
capable of playing consistently at the level of those in Berlin, Amsterdam or
Vienna. But after listening to one of the philharmonic's concerts last month
conducted by Chung, he felt that they had demonstrated that such comparisons
were no longer true.</P>
      <P>The philharmonic has performed "with just about as much precision as one would
think humanly possible, " the critic Steven Kruger wrote in the Berkshire Review
for the arts.</P>
      <P>Chung is one of the most influential Asian musicians in the world. He has
received many honors, such as the Premio Abbiati award and the Arturo Toscanni
award in Italy. He has also been named "Artist of the Year" by the Association
of French Theatres and Music Critics in 1991.</P>
      <P>In addition, he received the Legion d'honneur in 1992, and three times the
"Victoire de la Musique" in 1995, a French music award.</P>
      <P>This time he is leading the group to Taiwan's capital to present works by French
impressionist composer Maurice Ravel, and has also invited French pianist Roger
Muraro, winner of the International Franz Liszt Piano Competition, to play
Ravel's piano concerto in G Major.</P>
      <P>The piece is one of the only two concertos that Ravel has ever composed. It is
unrestrained in rhythm and elegant in melody. In fact, some regard it as the
most beautiful movement in all Ravel's compositions, the organizer of the NTCH
said.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Thursday his administration will do its best to find
a win-win solution to the dilemma of balancing economic development with
reducing greenhouse gas emissions.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks while meeting with representatives of major domestic
environmental advocacy groups to mark the 40th World Earth Day.</P>
      <P>Noting that the government has designated 2010 as the year for promoting energy
conservation and carbon reduction, Ma said various public agencies are carrying
out 30-plus programs to realize those goals.</P>
      <P>Through the concerted efforts of the government, business groups and individual
citizens, Ma said, Taiwan managed to lower its annual carbon emissions to the
2005 level last year, far ahead of the original target of reducing carbon
emissions to the 2008 level by 2020.</P>
      <P>In related developments that day, Premier Wu Den-yi announced the launch of a
low-carbon homeland program to mark Earth Day.</P>
      <P>Under the program, two low-carbon model communities in every city and county
will be built by 2011, while six low-carbon cities will be developed by 2014 and
four "low-carbon living circles" will take shape in northern, central, southern

Power Co, Formosa Plastics Corp. and CPC Corp., Taiwan, to step up carbon
reduction efforts to contribute to the campaign against global warming.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Vice Premier Eric Liluan Chu attended a "save the Earth through
carbon reduction" event organized by the Taiwan Institute for Sustainable Energy
(TISE).</P>
      <P>Chu walked from the Executive Yuan to the site of the activity at a square in
front of Taipei Main Station to signify his support for a low-carbon green
lifestyle.</P>
      <P>Noting that the government has mapped out a 10-year carbon reduction plan, Chu
said 10 strategies will be adopted to realize the goal of cutting carbon
reduction by 210 million tons by 2020 through an industrial policy overhaul,
power generation and transportation reforms, and environmental education.</P>
      <P>TISE Chairman Eugene Chien said Taiwan accounted for about 1 percent of the
world's total carbon emissions of 28.9 billion tons last year, making it the
world's 22nd-largest source of carbon emissions. Taiwan's ranking was even
higher at 17th in terms of per capita carbon emissions.</P>
      <P>To avoid possible sanctions from the rest of the world, Chien said, Taiwan must
intensify its energy conservation and carbon reduction campaign. He suggested
that the government take the lead in this regard by pushing state-run
enterprises to cut carbon emissions and adjusting development policies for high-

      <P>Local hotels and restaurants offering Norwegian salmon sushi faced rising costs
and sought alternatives after grounded European flights over the past week
slashed shipments of the popular fish.</P>
      <P>"We still have salmon shipped from Norway, but the number of shipments has
significantly dropped, " said Huang Lien-fa, vice president of PTC Nakajima
Suisan (Taiwan) Co.</P>
      <P>The company sells sushi at various up-market supermarkets around Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The price of Norwegian salmon shipped by plane has gone up 10 percent to 20
percent, he told CNA Thursday in a telephone interview.</P>
      <P>Grand Formosa Regent Taipei, one of Taiwan's international five- star hotels,
has also had its Norwegian salmon supplies reduced.</P>
      <P>"Our supplier told us that there will be supplies on Thursday, but they are not
sure about Friday, " said Ellen Chang, the hotel's public relations director.</P>
      <P>If the supplies are cut off, she said, the hotel will have to replace raw
Norwegian salmon with other dishes in its restaurants.</P>
      <P>The hotel might also use salmon from Canada for other salmon dishes on its
menus, she added.</P>
      <P>Chang said the hotel is not facing a price increase, as the hotel signs long-
term contracts with its suppliers to ensure stable supplies and prices.</P>
      <P>Sushi Express Co., Taiwan's largest sushi chain group, said the sharp decrease
in Norwegian salmon air shipments due to the volcanic ash cloud from Iceland has
caused an impact on its 137 stores around the country.</P>
      <P>"The cost has surged 20 percent and we have been switching to salmon from Canada
and Australia," a company executive said.</P>
      <P>Sushi Express, which imports 3 to 5 tons of salmon per day, is expected to have
its Norwegian salmon supplies returned to normal next week, the executive noted.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Carrefour supermarket chain was due to feature Norwegian salmon
shipped by plane at a promotional event Thursday, but was forced to use frozen
stocks instead.</P>
      <P>Although flights were resuming in Europe,  a local dealer providing raw
Norwegian salmon to northern Taiwan said that whether the supply and price of
the fish will return to normal in the following week will rely on how fast
airports in Europe resolve their flight backlogs. CNA Photo 119</P>

      <P>Helped by growing business on its European routes, Yang Ming Marine Transport
Corp. is expected to turn a profit in the second quarter of this year, the

      <P>Yang Ming Marine President Robert Ho explained that the freight rates on the
company's European routes had gone up since Q4 last year, with the percentage of
European lines business also increasing from 35 percent to 40 percent.</P>
      <P>"Spring has arrived for container services, " said Ho, who is also director-
general of the Chinese Shipowner's Association of Taipei.</P>
      <P>The company made a huge net loss of NT$15.84 billion (US$500 million) in 2009 --
the first annual loss for nearly 10 years.</P>
      <P>However, the losses in Q1 decreased by between 70 percent and 80 percent from
the same period of last year, Ho said.</P>
      <P>Ho pointed out that the recovery of the global economy and rising freight rates
have decreased the number of idle container ships worldwide to 400 -- resulting
in the ratio of container ships sitting idle at 7.5 percent compared to 600, or
11.7 percent, in Q3 last year.</P>
      <P>A proposed freight rate hike is expected to help the company also earn a profit
on its American routes by June or July, he went on.</P>
      <P>The company is also planning new routes, in addition to a recently launched
Australian route, Ho added.</P>
      <P>European routes account for about 40 percent of the company's business, American

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou expects the legislative  and executive branches to work
together to allay suspicion that recent legal amendments might lead to excessive
restrictions on press freedom, the Presidential Office said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The office issued the statement amid mounting media criticism of a package of
amendments to the Personal Data Protection Act that, if enacted, would require
news organizations to obtain the consent of an individual before publishing his
or her personal information.</P>
      <P>The requirement is seen as likely to undermine press freedom and even stymie the
operations of some local media organizations, particularly gossip tabloids and
TV talks shows that thrive on sensationalist exposes.</P>
      <P>Noting that freedom of the press is not only a constitutionally protected basic
human right but also the bedrock of democracy, the statement said Ma is adamant
that press freedom should be protected.</P>
      <P>On the controversy surrounding the proposed amendments to the Personal Data
Protection Act, the statement said the contention mainly results from the
conflict between two basic human rights -- freedom of the press and the right to
personal privacy.</P>
      <P>Describing the proposed amendments as being aimed at better protecting the
personal privacy of ordinary people, the statement said the move should actually
be seen as a step forward for Taiwan's human rights protection.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, the statement said, the draft amendments might indeed cause
improper restrictions on press freedom. In this regard, the statement said, the
president hopes the legislative and executive branches will take steps to make
necessary improvements and alleviate misgivings.</P>
      <P>The ruling Kuomintang-controlled Legislative Yuan originally planned to complete
a third reading of the contentious package Friday, but made a reversal Thursday
following a media outcry.</P>
      <P>After consulting with Cabinet officials, leading members of the KMT legislative
caucus said they will ask the legislature Friday to postpone the third reading
of the bill until April 27 to allow for more extensive discussion on the
contentious points.</P>

      <P>Grand Formosa Regent Taipei, one of Taiwan's international five- star hotels,
has also had its Norwegian salmon supplies reduced.</P>
      <P>"Our supplier told us that there will be supplies on Thursday, but they are not
sure about Friday, " said Ellen Chang, the hotel's public relations director.</P>
      <P>If the supplies are cut off, she said, the hotel will have to replace raw
Norwegian salmon with other dishes in its restaurants.</P>
      <P>The hotel might also use salmon from Canada for other salmon dishes on its
menus, she added.</P>
      <P>Chang said the hotel is not facing a price increase, as the hotel signs long-
term contracts with its suppliers to ensure stable supplies and prices.</P>
      <P>Sushi Express Co., Taiwan's largest sushi chain group, said the sharp decrease
in Norwegian salmon air shipments due to the volcanic ash cloud from Iceland has
caused an impact on its 137 stores around the country.</P>
      <P>"The cost has surged 20 percent and we have been switching to salmon from Canada
and Australia," a company executive said.</P>
      <P>Sushi Express, which imports 3 to 5 tons of salmon per day, is expected to have
its Norwegian salmon supplies returned to normal next week, the executive noted.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Carrefour supermarket chain was due to feature Norwegian salmon
shipped by plane at a promotional event Thursday, but was forced to use frozen
stocks instead.</P>
      <P>Although flights were resuming in Europe,  a local dealer providing raw
Norwegian salmon to northern Taiwan said that whether the supply and price of
the fish will return to normal in the following week will rely on how fast
airports in Europe resolve their flight backlogs. CNA Photo 119</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Helped by growing business on its European routes, Yang Ming Marine Transport
Corp. is expected to turn a profit in the second quarter of this year, the
company's president said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Yang Ming Marine President Robert Ho explained that the freight rates on the
company's European routes had gone up since Q4 last year, with the percentage of
European lines business also increasing from 35 percent to 40 percent.</P>
      <P>"Spring has arrived for container services, " said Ho, who is also director-
general of the Chinese Shipowner's Association of Taipei.</P>
      <P>The company made a huge net loss of NT$15.84 billion (US$500 million) in 2009 --
the first annual loss for nearly 10 years.</P>
      <P>However, the losses in Q1 decreased by between 70 percent and 80 percent from
the same period of last year, Ho said.</P>
      <P>Ho pointed out that the recovery of the global economy and rising freight rates
have decreased the number of idle container ships worldwide to 400 -- resulting
in the ratio of container ships sitting idle at 7.5 percent compared to 600, or
11.7 percent, in Q3 last year.</P>
      <P>A proposed freight rate hike is expected to help the company also earn a profit
on its American routes by June or July, he went on.</P>
      <P>The company is also planning new routes, in addition to a recently launched
Australian route, Ho added.</P>
      <P>European routes account for about 40 percent of the company's business, American
routes make up 35 percent, and the Middle East and Asian routes comprise 25
percent, Ho noted.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou expects the legislative  and executive branches to work
together to allay suspicion that recent legal amendments might lead to excessive
restrictions on press freedom, the Presidential Office said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The office issued the statement amid mounting media criticism of a package of
amendments to the Personal Data Protection Act that, if enacted, would require
news organizations to obtain the consent of an individual before publishing his
or her personal information.</P>
      <P>The requirement is seen as likely to undermine press freedom and even stymie the
operations of some local media organizations, particularly gossip tabloids and
TV talks shows that thrive on sensationalist exposes.</P>
      <P>Noting that freedom of the press is not only a constitutionally protected basic
human right but also the bedrock of democracy, the statement said Ma is adamant
that press freedom should be protected.</P>
      <P>On the controversy surrounding the proposed amendments to the Personal Data
Protection Act, the statement said the contention mainly results from the
conflict between two basic human rights -- freedom of the press and the right to
personal privacy.</P>
      <P>Describing the proposed amendments as being aimed at better protecting the
personal privacy of ordinary people, the statement said the move should actually
be seen as a step forward for Taiwan's human rights protection.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, the statement said, the draft amendments might indeed cause
improper restrictions on press freedom. In this regard, the statement said, the
president hopes the legislative and executive branches will take steps to make
necessary improvements and alleviate misgivings.</P>
      <P>The ruling Kuomintang-controlled Legislative Yuan originally planned to complete
a third reading of the contentious package Friday, but made a reversal Thursday
following a media outcry.</P>
      <P>After consulting with Cabinet officials, leading members of the KMT legislative
caucus said they will ask the legislature Friday to postpone the third reading
of the bill until April 27 to allow for more extensive discussion on the
contentious points.</P>

      <P>"We opened it and it was from 2002 and was thrown in the ocean in Taiwan... A
couple from Holland were on a cruise ship. He was an officer on a cruise ship

of bottles into the ocean, " Shaw was quoted as saying.</P>
      <P>"Every time we sail together we throw a few bottles into the sea and hope
someone will find it and write to us, " the couple said in the letter, which had
been laminated so that it would survive longer in the ocean.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Economic Daily News: Fixing housing prices is a piece of cake</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>04/23/10  10:50:03
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government has recently been trying to cool housing prices in response to
wide-ranging public outrage over the skyrocketing market.</P>
      <P>However, the measures taken, such as imposing credit controls on housing
projects in restricted areas and stopping the auctioning off of state-owned
property, will only push housing prices even higher. By suppressing supply when
demand keeps soaring, the government is unlikely to succeed in lowering prices.</P>
      <P>The fundamental method of stabilizing housing prices is to maintain a balance
between demand and supply. A good example is Singapore, where the government has
been building public housing communities, known as new towns, for rent to
citizens. If several such new towns were built in the greater Taipei area so
that residents could easily find a home, housing prices would stabilize
immediately.</P>
      <P>Hoisting the banner of "grassroots economy, " the government is now moving in
the right direction by planning to build a large number of cheap residential
units in the suburban Linkou area. But this is still not enough. More new towns
should be established in other habitable areas for rent to people who do not own
a home.</P>
      <P>Targeting those rich people who can spend big money on luxury residences, the
government should gradually work to improve the transparency of housing trading
prices and significantly raise housing and land tax rates to the levels of
advanced countries. This would fix the housing headache for good. (April 23,

      <P>Taiwan's unemployment rate stood at 5.67 percent in March, down 0.09 percent
from the month-earlier level, and the number of those on the jobless list also
declined by 10,000 to 624,000.</P>
      <P>Good news in March also included that the numbers of jobless people aged over 45
and those who have been unemployed for over one year have both fallen, while the
average regular salary for office workers rose by 2.64 percent in the January-
February period to NT$35,912, marking the greatest growth for same period in 10
years.</P>
      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih reiterated recently that he will resign if Taiwan's
unemployment rate remains higher than 5 percent by the end of this year.</P>
      <P>Wu said the Cabinet will make every possible effort to boost employment,
including speeding up the replacement of civil servants as they retire from
government service, creating jobs for new graduates in the hope that the global
economy will continue to recover.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from local media coverage of the issue:</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>Liu Tien-tsu, an official with the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and
Statistics, attributed the rise in average regular salaries in January and
February mainly to a steadily recovering global economy and a relatively lower
comparison base from 2009.</P>
      <P>However, Liu stressed that the overall condition of the local workforce market
has not yet returned to the levels prior to the 2008-2009 global economic
meltdown.</P>
      <P>This fact is indicated in declining average irregular salaries, including
performance awards, year-end bonuses and dividend payments, that office workers
received between December 2009 and February 2010 -- totaling NT$51,620, which
was down by NT$8,268 year on year, Liu said. (April 23, 2010).</P>
      <P>The Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>The latest International Monetary fund (IMF) report adjusted upward its forecast
for global economic growth to 4.2 percent for 2010, with Taiwan's GDP rising by
6.5 percent, the highest among the four Asian dragons -- Taiwan, Hong Kong,
South Korea and Singapore.</P>
      <P>However, the IMF also forecast that Taiwan's unemployment rate will top 5.4
percent for the year, the highest among the dragons.</P>
      <P>For 2011, the IMF forecast that Taiwan's GDP will grow a little bit slower by
4.8 percent to rank third among the dragons, while its unemployment rate will
top 4.9 percent, still the highest among the four. (April 23, 2010).</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>JPMorgan Chase edged GE out to become the world's largest company in terms of
revenue this year, while Taiwan's Hon Hai Precision topped all 39 Taiwanese
companies that made the Global 2000 list published by Forbes recently.</P>
      <P>China's ICBC ranked fifth and Hon Hai was 176th. Other Taiwanese companies that
made the Forbes Global 2000 list included Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing

    <HEADLINE>China Times: Why should Taiwan shut out Chinese students?</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>04/23/10  12:48:25
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Fear makes people retreat,  which leads to restraint  and eventually self-
inflicted isolation. Facing the rise of China, Taiwan should not be frightened
and should not back down, because the island has nothing to fall back on.</P>
      <P>Based on this view, instead of rejecting Chinese students, Taiwan should attract
them to study here in the hope that Taiwan's shine and warmth will rub off on
China through these students.</P>
      <P>But while all the colleges in the country are ready to take in Chinese students,
a bill aimed at lifting the restrictions on them has prompted a fracas at a
Legislative Yuan committee meeting, and more violent conflict is expected when
the bill is referred to the whole floor for passage.</P>
      <P>Why are the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) lawmakers going out of their way
to block the bill? They claim that Chinese students would strain the country's
educational resources, compete with local young people for job opportunities and
crowd local students out of schools.</P>
      <P>These worries are groundless, as the Education Ministry has said that Chinese
students will not affect local student intakes and will not receive a penny in
grants from the government, while the Examination Yuan has reiterated many times
that Chinese students will not be allowed to take civil service examinations and
as far as local colleges can maintain their competitiveness, Taiwan should not
be afraid of allowing its students to study abroad, including in China.</P>
      <P>The movement of talent is a worldwide trend and Taiwan should ride the wave by
adapting itself to it rather than bucking it. Taiwan should harness worldwide
talent to enhance its competitiveness.</P>
      <P>After undergoing peaceful democratic development and creating the economic
miracle, what can scare Taiwan? China is following the path Taiwan trod so many
years ago toward democracy and a market economy. Taiwan could help China to move
ahead on the road without deviation or retreat. The DPP is worried that Chinese
students in Taiwan will serve as Chinese agents to influence Taiwan, but on the
other hand, Taiwan could win over these students and make them side with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The DPP shut the country's doors on China for eight years during its rule of
Taiwan, at the cost of Taiwan's economic growth. Should it continue to hold the
country hostage? Taiwan welcomes talent from all over the world, so why should
it reject talent from China? Exchanges across the Taiwan Strait are an
irresistible tide, and education exchanges are an inevitable part of this.
Failing to realize this will undermine the DPP's bid to return to power. (April

    <HEADLINE>Customs official accused in Japanese beef smuggling scandal</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Amid a months-long dispute over U.S. beef imports that appear set to continue,
prosecutors in Taoyuan County, which houses Taiwan's largest international
airport, have discovered that a local trader has been smuggling in banned beef
from Japan for at least a year.</P>
      <P>Taoyuan district prosecutors and police raided a trading company in Taipei City
Thursday, seizing 95 kg of frozen Matsuzaka beef, a Japanese product that has
been barred from entering Taiwan since 2001 after Japan reported mad cow disease
outbreaks.</P>
      <P>The prosecution took in the firm's owner, identified as Chang Shih-chun, 52, and
two of his staff later that day for interrogation.</P>
      <P>During the probe, it was discovered that Chang had been sending two-to-six
employees every week to Japan since 2009, who smuggled the beef into Taiwan on
their return, according to the Taoyuan District Prosecutors Office.</P>
      <P>Each trip they brought back scores of kilograms of Matsuzaka beef -- one of the
most famous kinds of beef in Japan and internationally known for its perfectly
balanced fat-to-meat ratio. In Japan, Matsuzaka is considered one of the
generally recognized three most famous beef brands along with Kobe beef and
Yonezawa beef.</P>
      <P>The prosecution pointed out that the traders had colluded with an inspector at
the Taipei Customs Office (TCO) , who shielded the smugglers from customs
clearance checks at the Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport.</P>
      <P>The company is suspected of having smuggled at least one ton of Matsuzaka beef
from Japan over the past year, the prosecutors said.</P>
      <P>The case was not exposed until Wednesday, when a Taoyuan district prosecutor,
Ministry of Justice inspectors and TCO personnel detained three passengers upon
their arrival at the airport from Japan and discovered a total of 95 kg of
frozen Matsuzaka beef in their luggage.</P>
      <P>Upon learning about the TCO inspector's involvement of the smuggling, the
Director-General of Customs pledged to bring the suspect to justice.</P>
      <P>On Friday, local newspapers reports said Chang had sold the beef to local high-
end steak houses and teppanyaki restaurants at an average price of NT$9,000
(US$287) per kilo.</P>
      <P>The United Daily News quoted Chang as saying that "the beef is very popular" and
that it "sells out as soon as it arrives" in Taiwan.</P>

      <P>The number of job openings in Taiwan surged in April following an improvement in
the employment climate the previous month, two major job banks said Friday.</P>
      <P>A total of 326,000 job openings were available around Taiwan in April, up 66
percent, or 130,000, over the year-earlier level, according to data compiled by
online manpower agency 104 Job Bank.</P>
      <P>It was the greatest growth of its kind since the global financial meltdown that
started in the latter part of 2008, said Fang Guang-wei, a public relations
manager for the 104 Job Bank.</P>
      <P>The rising manpower demand came mainly from the computer and consumer
electronics manufacturing,  semiconductor manufacturing, optoelectronic and
solar energy, financial services and electronic component manufacturing sectors,
in that order, Fang said.</P>
      <P>"Demand in all these areas increased by over 150 percent year on year, " he
added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the 1111 Job Bank noted that many people change their jobs in
February after the Chinese New Year, contributing in part to the rise in job
openings in March.</P>
      <P>Henry Ho, public relations director of the 1111 Job Bank, said the number of
jobs listed with the job broker website in March totaled over 200,000,
representing a month-on-month increase of 46 percent.</P>
      <P>Most of the openings were available in the hi-tech manufacturing sector, the
financial services sector and the real estate and housing brokerage sector, Ho
said.</P>
      <P>The unemployment rate stood at 5.67 percent in March, down 0.09 percent over the
month-earlier level and the number of those on the jobless list also declined by
10,000 to 624,000 people, according to the Directorate General of Budget,
Accounting and Statistics.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Liberty Times: Taiwan's workers must brace for fewer jobs, lower pay</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>04/23/10  13:50:16
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said at a meeting of the Kuomintang's (KMT's) Central
Standing Committee that about 80,000 local workers could be affected by the
proposed trade pact with China. They will not necessarily lose their jobs, but
probably will have to accept lower pay or fewer perquisites.</P>
      <P>Wages dropping because of the country's trade pact with China is not what is
anticipated, but that is what is going on. It will not be necessary to bring
wages down to China's level, but they will gradually move in that direction.</P>
      <P>Owing to its close economic ties with China, Taiwan's wage level has apparently
been dragged down in recent years and has declined to the level of 13 years ago,
while unemployment is surging.</P>
      <P>This trend is set to accelerate after the conclusion of the trade pact with
China.</P>
      <P>In order to avoid this, Taiwan should seek to boost domestic investment by
inking free trade pacts with developed countries that boast higher wage levels
rather than with developing states that have lower wage levels.</P>
      <P>Under those circumstances, local wages would be driven up toward the levels of
the developed countries. It would be a win-win situation for both management and
the workers. However, a trade pact with China will only cost the country the
chance of upgrading its industry and lay Taiwan open to China's political
manipulation.</P>
      <P>At the same time, local workers will face the risk of losing their jobs and the
prospects of declining wages. This is a lose-lose case for management and
workers alike.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the increasing exchanges with China evoked by the trade pact will
help China gain Taiwan's technology and make it easier for it to compete with
Taiwan. This means that the pact will benefit China more than Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Fortunately, Taiwan is a democracy and people do not have to resign themselves
to the government's decision on the trade pact with China.  Now that the people
are overwhelmingly calling for a referendum on the pact, the Ma administration
will be swept away if it dares to try to crush it. (April 23, 2010)</P>

    <HEADLINE>Tourism Bureau sees promotion drive paying off as arrivals surge</HEADLINE>

04/23/10  16:10:12

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's efforts to promote tourism are paying off as the number of visitors in
March hit a new single-month high of 516,512, Tourism Bureau Director-General
Janice Lai said Friday.</P>
      <P>The number marked a steep 30.7 percent year-on-year growth and beat the previous
single-month record of 450,000 set last December, Lai said.</P>
      <P>"Most encouraging was the fact that there was an increase in the number of
visitors from every major tourist source in March, "she noted.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the number of arrivals in every individual category also all increased
from the year-earlier level, she added. For example, the number of sightseers,
which formed 60 percent of the total arrivals, rose 46 percent in March, she
said.</P>
      <P>Even more impressive was the 85 percent year-on-year increase in the number of
visitors who came to Taiwan for study purposes, said Lai. In other categories,
the number of conference-goers rose by 60 percent, the number of visitors
attending family reunions by 30 percent, and the number of business visitors by
21 percent.</P>
      <P>"All these figures indicate that not only the Tourism Bureau but also various
government agencies have contributed to the drive to attract more visitors to
Taiwan," Lai said.</P>
      <P>Amid improved relations across the Taiwan Strait, China emerged as Taiwan's main
source of tourism in March, with 149,617 Chinese citizens visiting the island,
up 71.97 percent year-on-year. Incentive trips offered by major China-based
companies contributed significantly to the surge in the number of Chinese
tourist arrivals, Lai said.</P>
      <P>Altogether, Chinese travelers made 344,136 visits to Taiwan in the first quarter
of this year -- an increase of 98.64 percent year-on-year. Travel industry
sources predicted that the total number of Chinese visitors will break the 1
million mark this year.</P>
      <P>Japan ranked second in terms of the number of visitors to Taiwan in March,
totaling 112,231 and up 6.5 percent year-on-year.</P>
      <P>Hong Kong and Macau combined were the third largest source, with 61,024
arrivals, which represented an annual growth rate of 6.9 percent.</P>
      <P>The number of visits by American citizens in March was 37,696, which marked a
26.86 percent year-on-year increase and put the U.S. in fourth place as a
tourism source.</P>
      <P>The Tourism Bureau's promotional blitz in Times Square and on New York  subways,
coupled  with its invitations  to U.S.  media professionals and travel
executives to explore Taiwan's tourist attractions, has helped to boost the
market, Lai said.</P>
      <P>She noted that the annual number of arrivals from Malaysia rose by a whopping
106.96 percent to 26,698, which put Malaysia in fifth place as a tourism source
market. She attributed the steep growth in visitor arrivals from that country to
the increase in the number of Taiwan-Malaysia flights and the launch of budget
travel between the two countries.</P>
      <P>The number of visitors from Europe, Singapore and South Korea increased in March
by 17.37 percent, 14.75 percent and 28.67 percent, respectively.</P>
      <P>The increase in the number of tourist arrivals has benefited the local travel
and hospitality industries and even street vendors, market sources said.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the tourism boom has helped hotel operators in the eastern counties of
Taitung and Hualien tide over the effects of Typhoon Morakot, which wreaked
havoc in southern and southeastern Taiwan last August, according to industry
sources.</P>
      <P>Following Taiwan's wider opening to Chinese tourists nearly two years ago, 10
tourist hotels with a total of 2,602 rooms have been under construction, Tourism
Bureau statistics show. In addition, 137 new general hotels have opened and 805
others have had facelifts, in anticipation of an increasing number of visitors
from China.</P>
      <P>Five new tourist hotels are scheduled to open this year and four international
hotel chains, including Okura and Le Meridien, are expected to come on line in
Taiwan next year.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) has prepared a plan under which nearly
NT$5.5 billion (US$175 million)  will be spent assisting  local factories  in
making high-quality, reasonably priced consumer products for sales to emerging
markets, a trade official said Friday.</P>
      <P>The ministry briefed the Executive Yuan about the plan at a weekly meeting a day
earlier, saying that the plan was initiated as part of an effort to explore the
vast middle-class markets in emerging countries such as China, India and
Indonesia.</P>
      <P>The rise of middle-class consumers in these emerging markets has stirred up a
trend of consumption of premium and easily affordable products in the post-
financial storm era, said Bureau of Foreign Trade chief secretary Chiang Wen-
juo.</P>
      <P>She pointed out that in the first three months of this year, "our general
exports grew by 52.2 percent on average, but exports to most emerging countries
showed a rise of over 60 percent."</P>
      <P>"This shows that demand is very high in these countries, " Chiang said in an
interview with Radio Taiwan International.</P>
      <P>The official explained  that the middle class in emerging countries is now a
group of strong consumers who, although unable to afford such high-priced
products that some European and American customers can, nevertheless desire
consumer items that give the impression of luxury but at more modest prices.</P>
      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih said in Thursday's Cabinet meeting that emerging economic
entities have become an important power that is pushing global economic growth.</P>
      <P>As an export-reliant country, Taiwan should target these markets in efforts to
boost overseas sales with its premium yet fairly priced information
communication products, he said after the MOEA briefing.</P>
      <P>Under the three-year plan, budget will be allocated to help local businesses
create 40 innovative products that are internationally competitive in terms of
quality and price, establishing five new international or regional brands and
increasing Taiwan's exports to emerging countries by 30 percent before the end
of 2012, according to the MOEA.</P>
      <P>Efforts will also be made to promote Taiwan's high-quality consumer products
overseas through strategies that include building an international online
shopping mall, organizing trade fairs in emerging markets including China, India
and Vietnam, and opening special zones at various business exhibitions held in
Taipei to allow foreign buyers to get in touch with Taiwan's creative products,

(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President  Ma Ying-jeou  is set to debate with opposition Democratic Progressive
Party Chairperson Tsai Ing-wen on Taiwan's proposed economic cooperation
framework agreement (ECFA) with China on Sunday.</P>
      <P>We hope their discussion will be based on substance rather than ideology.</P>
      <P>The first point that should be made clear is that this pact is nothing unique to
Taiwan and China. It is an agreement designed by the World Trade Organization
(WTO) as a transitional step toward a free trade pact. China inked such a pact
with ASEAN in 2003 before moving on to a free trade agreement in 2010.</P>
      <P>WTO members sign ECFAs to eliminate barriers between them. Anyone who claims
that Taiwan is downgrading itself by choosing an ECFA with China instead of a
free trade agreement is misleading the public.</P>
      <P>As a member of the WTO, Taiwan should follow the organization's rules in making
such deals -- not only with China, but with all members. Any debate on whether
Taiwan should strike such a deal with China is totally pointless.</P>
      <P>Then we have to ask: Is there any option other than ECFA to wipe out the trade
barriers between Taiwan and China? The answer is "no." Taiwan has only been
reaching out to China for two years, and therefore it is impossible to sign a
free trade agreement immediately.</P>
      <P>Although the elimination of trade barriers will bring benefits to both sides in
the long term, in the meantime the transformation will help industries that
benefit from competition and undermine those which aren't competitive.</P>
      <P>So the only issues worth debating are which industries will be negatively and
positively affected by an ECFA, to what extent they will be influenced, and
whether the gains will outweigh the losses.</P>
      <P>We hope the two debaters will focus on these points and inform the public of the
pros and cons of the deal. (April 23, 20100)</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou's spokesman rebutted Friday an accusation by opposition
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairperson Tsai Ing-wen that the ruling
Kuomintang (KMT) was the instigator of the latest brawl in the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Lo Chih-chiang said the remarks appeared to clash with the image Tsai works to
maintain of being a woman of integrity.</P>
      <P>Lo made the comment in response to a report carried that day in the Liberty
Times newspaper that cited Tasi as saying that the tension between the ruling
and opposition parties was deliberately fomented by the KMT.</P>
      <P>Amid the approach of a widely anticipated debate between Ma and Tsai slated for
April 25 on the proposed economic cooperation framework agreement with China,
"it is bad to deliberately stir up confrontation and conflict," Tsai was quoted
as saying.</P>
      <P>Lo noted that Tsai has a reputation for maintaining an image of being rational
and honest, but appears now to be describing "herself as the victim of a crime
she herself committed" -- a reference to the recent violent scuffles in the
Legislative Yuan blamed by the KMT on the DPP.</P>
      <P>The incident, which occurred April 21, ended with KMT Legislator Chao Li-yun,
who had been presiding over a meeting to screen two controversial education
bills that would pave the way for local universities to admit students from
China, being taken to hospital after briefly fainting after the brawl broke out.</P>
      <P>Ma later urged Tsai not to condone her party's disruption of legislative

    <HEADLINE>Bill aimed at expediting trial of criminal cases passed</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A bill aimed at expediting the prosecution of criminal cases passed the
Legislative Yuan Friday, a measure legislators hope will prevent trials and
appeals from dragging on for more than a decade as occurs at present.</P>
      <P>Legislator Hsieh Kuo-liang, convener of the Judiciary and Organic Laws and
Statutes Committee, said he hoped the new statute would prevent the Supreme
Court from repeatedly remanding cases back to lower courts because of indecision
or minor flaws or stop prosecutors from filing endless appeals of not guilty
verdicts.</P>
      <P>The new law, which was passed with the support of both the ruling and opposition
parties, limits the period in which criminal cases -- including the initial
trial and all subsequent re-trials or appeals -- must be resolved to eight
years.</P>
      <P>The impetus for the bill has been a number of cases in Taiwan that have lasted
for a decade -- and even decades -- in some cases outlasting the criminals or
defendants involved.</P>
      <P>Under the new statute, if a case spends eight years in the courts without a
final resolution, the defendant will be released if he or she was found not

the sentence if found guilty at that point in the process.</P>
      <P>By the same token, the defendant cannot be detained for more than eight years
prior to a final conviction.</P>
      <P>The new statute will also prohibit prosecutors from appealing a case if the
defendant is found not guilty at both the district court and high court level,
unless the ruling has serious technical flaws.</P>
      <P>The law will become binding two years after it is promulgated by the president,
to give the judiciary system time to prepare for it.</P>
      <P>Judiciary Yuan official Lin Chun-yi said there are currently 30 defendants who
have been detained for more than five years as their cases make their way
through the court system.</P>
      <P>He said the judiciary system will try to close their cases within the next two
years before the new statute takes effect.</P>

    <HEADLINE>No farm products on ECFA 'early harvest list': COA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 23 (CNA)

      <P>To protect Taiwanese farmers, agricultural products from China will not be
included in a planned cross-strait economic cooperation framework agreement's
(ECFA) "early harvest list," a Council of Agriculture official (COA) said
Friday.</P>
      <P>Hsiau  Dong-chong,  deputy  director-general  of the  COA's International
Cooperation Division, said that at the second round of ECFA negotiations, which
concluded April 1, China agreed not to demand further opening of Taiwan's market
for Chinese agricultural products or to include its farm products on the "early
harvest" list.</P>
      <P>The "early harvest list" refers to goods and services that will enjoy lower or
no tariffs if the ECFA is signed.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has maintained bans on the importation of 830 agricultural products from
China that were in effect when President Ma Ying-jeou took office on May 20,
2008, and will not reduce tariffs on the 1,415 agricultural items already
allowed, Hsiao said.</P>
      <P>She was responding to remarks by former National Policy Adviser Huang Yueh-sui
that Taiwan's agriculture and fishery sectors could suffer a heavy blow if an
ECFA is signed.</P>
      <P>Hsiau added that at the first round of ECFA talks in Beijing on Jan. 26, Taiwan
refused to discuss issues related to further opening Taiwan to Chinese
agricultural products.</P>
      <P>Costs are the main reason behind the government's decision to allow imports of
some types of agricultural products, Hsiao said.</P>
      <P>For example, Taiwan began allowing the importation of watermelon seeds from
China in 1989 because local farmers didn't show interest in the product due to
high production costs, Hsiao said. Statistics from 2007 show 7.97 hectares were
devoted to the plants, a figure that decreased to 1.06 hectares in 2008. There
was almost no production in 2009, she said.</P>
      <P>However, Taiwan still bans the import of Chinese watermelons, she pointed out.</P>
      <P>The opening to imports of Chinese Pu-erh tea leaves and garlic from China was
due to the fact they are not produced locally, or because of high transport
costs for imports from other countries, Hsiao added.</P>

      <P>A dry spell that threatens Kaohsiung water supplies eased slightly as the area
saw rains Friday morning.</P>
      <P>However, government officials said the rainfall was far from enough to help
reservoirs take in sufficient water to maintain a normal supply beyond June.</P>
      <P>Wu Yueh-si, the deputy director-general of the Water Resources Agency, said that
although the rain did not solve shortages, it helped provide some relief for
daily water use. "We are still waiting for more precipitation to come," Wu said.</P>
      <P>The rain started at around 6: 00 a.m. and fell mainly on the flatlands. As of 8:
00 a.m., it had rained the most in Gangshan City in Kaohsiung County, which saw
40 millimeters, local weathermen said. Kaohsiung City only received 3-4 mm and
mountainous areas only saw a drizzle.</P>
      <P>Taking advantage of the rainfall brought about by weather fronts that approached
Taiwan, WRA personnel produced some 10 mm of artificial rain.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the season's first crop of rice paddies benefited from the rainfall,
Wu said. However, it had little effect on the Kaoping River, a major river in
southern Taiwan's Kaohsiung and Pingtung counties.</P>
      <P>"We took about 930,000 tons of water from the Kaoping River on Friday, " Wu
said, adding that water supplies may only last several months.</P>
      <P>No rain has fallen in parts of southern Taiwan since Typhoon Morakot lashed that
part of the country last August. Spring rice planting in some areas of central
and southern Taiwan has been suspended to save water.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SEF chairman stresses urgency of cross-strait trade deal</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>04/23/10  19:47:03</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>"Taiwan must not delay the signing of a mutual tariff concession agreement with
China, as it is much easier to reach consensus on a limited list of items for
tariffs reduction or exemption than to conclude a comprehensive economic
cooperation pact," according to the chairman of the Straits Exchange Foundation
(SEF).</P>
      <P>In an interview with focustaiwan.tw, Chiang Pin-kung spoke of the urgency of
Taiwan signing the proposed economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) with
mainland China.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan's move to negotiate and sign an ECFA with the mainland is, first of all,
due to the current trend of fast-moving economic integration, " said Chiang.</P>
      <P>He stressed the need for an export-oriented economy to ensure that Taiwan can
compete on a fair footing in export markets and avoid being economically
marginalized.</P>
      <P>"To date, both sides of the Taiwan Strait have held two rounds of formal
negotiations on the ECFA and have achieved consensus on matters such as the
basic structure of clauses in the agreement and rules and positions pertaining
to the 'early harvest list' of goods and services," he added.</P>
      <P>Chiang, a former minister of economic affairs (1993-1996) , explained that the
"early harvest list" will cover only about 500 items. It will not include
products in sensitive sectors that may become vulnerable to competition when
more tariff-free imports are allowed into the domestic market.</P>
      <P>"The much misunderstood 'early harvest list' is designed to ease the impact of
tariff concessions on domestic industries and allow time for the economy to
adjust to a new trade policy,"he explained.</P>
      <P>Over the years, Taiwan has opened its market to 8,612 products from the Chinese
mainland, including 7,200 industrial items and 1,412 agricultural products. In
the ECFA negotiations on the "early harvest list", Taiwan has insisted that only
about 500 of the 1,378 industrial items still under import control will be
listed for tariff concessions and that none of the 830 restricted Chinese
agricultural items will be included, Chiang said.</P>
      <P>Chiang forecast  that Taiwan industries  will benefit from cross-strait
economic cooperation in areas such as investment protection, intellectual rights
protection and tariff concessions, under the ECFA with China.</P>
      <P>According to an SEF report, China was the largest market for Taiwan products in
2008, absorbing US$74 billion worth of exports at an average tariff rate of 9
percent. Meanwhile, Taiwan imported US$31.4 billion worth of goods from China in
2008 at an average tariff rate of 4 percent, the figures show.</P>
      <P>Since the average import tariff rate in China was relatively higher,  a cross-
strait  trade agreement  that includes tariff concessions would be in Taiwan's
favor, the report states.</P>
      <P>Stressing the urgency of the ECFA, Chiang said it could lead to bilateral trade
agreements with other Asian economies and that Taiwan may face fewer obstacles
in its pursuit of such pacts.</P>
      <P>"With the establishment of a free trade zone involving six members of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and mainland China on Jan. 1 this
year, products are flowing within that zone tariff-free, which puts Taiwan at a
disadvantage, " Chiang said.</P>
      <P>The Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) 7.0 data base has forecast that with
the formation of the ASEAN plus China tariff free zone, Taiwan may see a 0.176
percent drop in its gross domestic product, a 0.412 percent decline in exports
and a 0.601 percent fall in imports.</P>
      <P>As a matter of fact, since a free trade agreement between ASEAN and China took
effect in 2005, Taiwan products in the China market have been lagging behind
those of the 10 ASEAN member states.</P>
      <P>In 2004, China imported US$64.7 billion worth of products from Taiwan, while
imports from ASEAN amounted to US$62.9 billion. Last year, China's imports from
Taiwan amounted to US$85.7 billion, while those from ASEAN totaled US$106.2
billion.</P>
      <P>Statistics  compiled by Taiwan and China's customs offices indicate that in
2009, China's import tariffs on Taiwan petrochemical products averaged 6.49
percent, on machinery 8.23 percent, and on automobiles and auto parts 14.92
percent.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, petrochemical products from the ASEAN countries were subject to an
average 0.98 percent import tariffs at China's customs in 2009 and the rate has
been reduced further to an average 0.25 percent this year.</P>
      <P>China has also dropped the average tariff rate on machinery imports from the
ASEAN countries from 2.08 percent in 2009 to 0.07 percent in 2010, and on
automobiles and auto parts from 7.04 percent to 4.31 percent.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan government is hoping that the ECFA will help Taiwan products to
remain competitive in the Chinese market, according to Chiang. It is also
pushing for the service sector to be included on the ECFA "early harvest list"
so that it can maintain its competitive edge, he added.</P>
      <P>The SEF chairman noted that Taiwan and China last year signed three memorandums
of understanding (MOUs) on financial supervision, which allows banking,
insurance, and securities and futures firms to conduct business in each others
territory. However, there are issues related to a difference in market access
thresholds, as defined by the World Trade Organization (WTO) , that need to be
resolved, he added.</P>
      <P>According to WTO regulations, Taiwan as a developed economy has lower market
access threshold compared to developing economies, including China. But Chiang
said the market access issue can also be resolved in the negotiation of the
trade agreement between Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>Admitting  that certain  local industries  would  encounter unprecedented
competition from Chinese products with the signing of the ECFA, Chiang said that
the Taiwan government has worked out a series of remedial measures in line with
WTO regulations in order to protect the vulnerable sectors.</P>
      <P>These include anti-dumping  duties,  countervailing  duties, compensatory
duties, and subsidies to certain disadvantaged sectors, he added.</P>
      <P>While the government has been trying to find ways for Taiwan's industries  to
maintain their competitiveness,  discussions  by politicians, in the media, and
in various economic sectors reflect the general concerns that persist over the
negative impact of the proposed ECFA.</P>
      <P>But Chiang thinks that some of the arguments are colored by ideological
orientations.</P>
      <P>"It is possible that there is some confusion over 'technical terms' such as
'early harvest list', but regrettably some of the negative responses to the
proposed trade pact are spurred by ideologically oriented arguments," Chiang
said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's pro-independence camp filed a new petition Friday for a referendum on
the proposed economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) with China, eight
months after their previous bid was rejected.</P>
      <P>The latest petition, initiated by the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) and other
groups, was submitted to the Central Election Commission (CEC) with signatures
of 110,000 supporters.</P>
      <P>TSU officials said in a news conference earlier in the day that a second-phase
signature drive will be launched next week, with the goal of collecting 1
million signatures.</P>
      <P>Former President Lee Teng-hui, the TSU's spiritual leader, set the goal even
higher at 2 million signatures.</P>
      <P>Lee argued that the ECFA would be disastrous for Taiwan because it is not an
agreement between sovereign states, but one that is similar to the Closer
Economic Partnership Arrangement between China and the special administrative
regions of Hong Kong and Macau.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, the ECFA is part of China's plot to annex Taiwan under the
pretense of economic cooperation.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese people should be given a say on the ECFA issue so that they can decide
their own fate, he added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Su Jia-chuan, secretary-general of the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) , threatened to launch extensive protests against the
administration of President Ma Ying-jeou if it again blocks the referendum bid
and insists on going ahead with its plan to sign the agreement with China in
June.</P>
      <P>The previous initiative for a referendum on the ECFA was filed by the DPP in
July last year, with the proposed question: "Do you agree that the government
should hold a referendum to allow the people to decide on the signing of a
Taiwan-China ECFA?"</P>
      <P>The initiative, however, was rejected by the Cabinet's Referendum Screening
Committee one month later. The committee said it was based on a hypothetical
situation and did not meet the criteria of the Referendum Law.</P>
      <P>In the latest petition, the proposed question has been rephrased to: "Do you
agree with the government's plan to sign an ECFA with China?"</P>
      <P>Upon receiving the TSU's referendum petition, CEC Spokesman Teng Tien-yu said
the CEC will meet May 4 to determine if the new proposal meets legal
requirements.</P>
      <P>Under the Referendum Law, a referendum proposal must pass two thresholds to be
accepted. In the initial stage, signatures from 0.5 percent, or 86,608, of the
17,321,622 eligible voters in the last presidential election must be collected.</P>
      <P>If a referendum screening committee finds that the proposed referendum conforms
to legal guidelines, the referendum's initiators then need to collect signatures
from 5 percent, or 866,081 eligible voters, for the question to be put to
referendum.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOI promises to address shortage of social workers in Taiwan</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of the Interior (MOI) plans to subsidize the hiring of more social
workers by local governments after controversy over a recent mother and daughter
murder-suicide brought to light the severe shortage of such workers in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The MOI said Friday that there are currently 1,688 social workers on government
payrolls, far from the number needed, and before their ranks can be replenished,
the ministry will continue to provide subsidies to help local governments
recruit new people.</P>
      <P>Local governments are responsible for hiring social workers, but because  many
of them are currently  facing serious financial constraints, they cannot afford
to hire more people to meet actual needs, causing the quality of social services
to suffer, the ministry noted.</P>
      <P>That decline in quality and the difficulties social workers face gained public
exposure recently when a mother killed herself and her daughter despite the
daughter's attempt to seek assistance.</P>
      <P>Social workers generally were blamed for the tragedy, but amid mounting
criticism, more than 100 social workers mobilized by a group trying to form a
union staged protests outside the MOI and the Executive Yuan Friday.</P>
      <P>The group complained that the government "took the lead" in blaming them for the
incident by describing them as not being proactive enough, lacking experience,
showing poor judgment, and acting negligently.</P>
      <P>The protesters countered that the government was unaware of the inadequacies and
flaws in its policies and demanded that a long-term and stable hiring system for
social workers be established as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The MOI said that to strengthen the ranks of social workers at the local
government level, the central government has subsidized the hiring of an
additional 320 social workers to protect children and teenagers and 190 social
workers to attend to domestic violence and sexual offense cases since 2006.</P>
      <P>Since 2008, it has used part of the proceeds from the public welfare lottery to
help local governments increase their staffing of social workers to strengthen
services for children, teenagers, women, the elderly and the physically and
mentally challenged, the MOI said.</P>

      <P>Holland's envoy to Taiwan, Menno Goedhart, said Friday that he and his wife have
decided to make Taiwan their home after he retires.</P>
      <P>At the launch of his new book "The Real Taiwan and the Dutch" at Fort Provintia
in Tainan City, Goedhart said he and his wife will resettle in the southern
township of Sinhua in Tainan County when his tenure as the Netherlands' top
envoy to Taiwan ends later this year.</P>
      <P>Over the past eight years, Goedhart has visited almost every corner of the
Taiwan -- including some areas that are unfamiliar to many Taiwanese -- to trace
the footprints of his ancestors who ruled Taiwan between 1524 and 1662.</P>
      <P>During that period, some citizens of Holland married local aborigines, mostly
from the Rukai tribe that is one the 10-odd recognized indigenous groups in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Goedhart, who has built a close friendship with the Rukai people, was given an
"elder" title by the tribe in Shantimen township in Pingtung. He is one of two
foreign citizens on whom the Rukai bestowed the title, the first being also a
Hollander who was given the honor in the early 20th century.</P>
      <P>Goedhart's book, published in Chinese and English, features many of Taiwan's
most attractive destinations, including the counties of Hualien and Taitung in
eastern Taiwan, the cities and counties of Tainan and Chiayi in the central part
and the offshore Penghu County. It also focuses on the indigenous tribes around
the country.</P>
      <P>According to Goedhart, he plans to make his home in Tainan when he retires and
to travel around Taiwan promoting his book. All proceeds from the book will to
be donated to the victims of Typhoon Morakot which devastated parts of eastern
and southern Taiwan last August, he added.</P>
      <P>At the book launch, Tainan Mayor Hsu Tain-tsair dubbed Goedhart as "the Marco
Polo of Taiwan, " citing the envoy's ambitious plan to sell Taiwan to the rest
of the world.</P>
      <P>Marco Polo was a Venetian merchant and adventurer who visited China in the 13th
century and wrote a book called "Il Milione di Marco Polo, " which gave

      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih said Friday that the government has helped reduce the jobless
rate and allowed as many as 220,000 people on unpaid leave to return to their
jobs over the past year.</P>
      <P>The premier noted that the unemployment rate hit an all-time high of 6.13
percent in August 2009, the highest on record since the government began
compiling unemployment statistics in 1978. The figure dropped to 5.64 percent
last month.</P>
      <P>The government is pushing for a "velvet revolution" to quickly drive down
unemployment rates, he said.</P>
      <P>Public efforts over the past year have reversed and changed many figures, the
premier continued.</P>
      <P>He cited the jobless rate in industrial zones as an example, saying that between
February and March in 2009, there were nearly 230,000 on unpaid leave, but that
the number has since dropped to less than 3,000, and would continue to drop.</P>
      <P>In the science-based parks, the number on unpaid leaves peaked at 126,000, but
now stands at under 100, he said.</P>
      <P>The premier said earlier in the week that he will resign if Taiwan's
unemployment rate remains above 5 percent by the end of this year.</P>

      <P>Japan has decided to allow imports of Taiwan dragon fruit, after more than nine
years of effort on Taiwan's part to gain access to that market, the Council of

country on a total acreage of 800 hectares, with the central and southern parts
of the country being the main areas of production.</P>
      <P>An annual output is 15,158 tons and is valued about NT$420 million (US$13.38
million), Ko said.</P>
      <P>Given Taiwan's outstanding breeding, cultivation and management technologies,
its dragon fruit variety is superior to those grown in southeast Asian
countries, in terms of color, taste and texture, he added.</P>
      <P>"Our dragon fruit has great market potential, but it has to pass rigorous
quarantine checks before it can be exported to Japan, " Ko said.</P>
      <P>Because the Oriental fruit fly and melon fly are found in Taiwan, it has been
difficult for Taiwan to obtain permission to export its dragon fruit, which
hosts those pests, to Japan, Ko said.</P>
      <P>In 2001, the quarantine bureau managed to develop a special dragon fruit
disinfection  technology and in 2003 developed a high-temperature steaming
technology to kill fruit flies on dragon fruit.</P>
      <P>"We then filed an application with Japan in 2004 for dragon fruit exports and
finally passed Japan's stringent quarantine examinations this year, " Ko said,
adding that shipments to Japan are expected to hit 100 tons in the first year.</P>
      <P>Noting that the types of Taiwan-grown fruit exported to Japan has continued to
expand in recent years, Ko said Taiwan now exports about 11,000 tons of fresh
fruits to Japan annually, worth about NT$670 million. The different types of
fruits include mangoes, grapes, papayas, mandarin orange, pomelo, lychees,
bananas and pineapples.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has also applied to Japan for permission to export star fruit,
cantaloupe, guava, pears and Indian dates. However, Japan has not yet completed
screening of those applications, he said, adding that the bureau is now
developing disinfection technologies for bell fruit and pineapple-custard apple.</P>

      <P>Lu Yen-hsun, Taiwan's top-ranked tennis player, advanced to the semifinals of
the Status Athens Open Friday with a flawless 6-4, 6-1 victory over Japan's
Yuichi Sugita.</P>
      <P>The eighth-seeded Lu has yet to lose a set in his first three matches at the
85,000 euro ATP Challenger event and remained sharp against his Japanese
quarterfinal opponent, winning the match without ever facing a break point.</P>
      <P>Lu, ranked 102nd in the world, got in an uncharacteristically high 77 percent of
first serves and broke Sugita four times to coast to victory in just over an
hour.</P>
      <P>He will now meet world No. 257 Gilles Muller of Luxembourg in Saturday's
semifinals, as he pursues his first tournament title since winning another
Challenger event (second-tier events on the men's tennis tour) in South Korea
last November.</P>
      <P>Lu reached a career best ranking of 55 last June, but it has since tumbled to
around 100 because he has played more main ATP Tour events against the world's
best players since the middle of last year, with mixed results.</P>
      <P>Teamed with Rik de Voest of South Africa, the 26-year-old Taiwanese has also
reached the semifinals of the doubles event in Athens, after defeating top seeds
Leos Friedl and David Skoch of the Czech Republic 6-1, 6-0 on Thursday.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's industrial production index reached a record high in March and grew at
a double-digit clip for the fifth consecutive month, the Ministry of Economic
Affairs (MOEA) reported Friday.</P>
      <P>The index rose 39.2 percent year-on-year in March to a record 120.30. It also
registered 47.1 percent annual growth in the first quarter, the MOEA said in a
statement.</P>
      <P>The MOEA attributed the continuing rise in industrial production to the global
economy's steady recovery and growing cross-Taiwan Strait trade activity.</P>
      <P>The improving economy was also reflected in the 42 percent rise in the
manufacturing production index in March.</P>
      <P>Among individual product categories, the production index for electronic parts
and components increased by 77.3 percent, leading all categories, while the
indexes for motor vehicles and parts, and machinery climbed 63.8 percent and
58.5 percent, respectively, according to MOEA figures.</P>
      <P>The electronic parts and components production  index also increased by 100.6
percent in the first quarter from the same period last year.</P>
      <P>The robust growth received a major boost from the recent launches of products
featuring new technology and the need to replenish parts inventories, the MOEA
noted.</P>
      <P>Because electronic industry inventories  have remained low, recently, with some
components in short supply, the production of semiconductors,  flat panels and
optoelectronic  materials rose considerably to meet heavy demand, it added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A top Kuomintang official criticized the opposition Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) Friday for avoiding any mention of possible benefits that a proposed trade
pact with China might bring to Taiwan, as a debate on the issue between the
leaders of the two parties looms.</P>
      <P>KMT Secretary-General King Pu-tsung accused the DPP for overly politicizing a
planned economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) between Taiwan and
China.</P>
      <P>He said that in Sunday's debate on the ECFA between President Ma Ying-jeou, who
doubles as the KMT's chairman, and DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen, Ma will explain
how the government is trying to push the trade accord to give Taiwan a path of
sustainable development.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, the DPP's anti-ECFA proposals are aimed at pressuring Ma to
step down, King argued.</P>
      <P>The DPP should keep in mind that in a democracy, the minority must follow the
majority, and the DPP should therefore work to seek more mainstream support,
King said.</P>
      <P>He also criticized Tsai for attempting to obfuscate the issue by using
"political language, " saying that calling on DPP supporters to boycott the
proposed trade accord is related to politics rather than to the policy.</P>
      <P>While the KMT is taking the ECFA seriously as a policy issue for debate, it is
regretful that Tsai, who usually acts rationally, is attempting to turn it into
a political issue, King contended.</P>
      <P>The upcoming debate between Ma and Tsai on the trade pact has already drawn
media attention from around the world because in many countries, the head of
state rarely participates in a debate with the opposition, according to King.</P>
      <P>Because the trade pact will be beneficial to Taiwan and a critical element in
its economic development in the coming decade, the president felt he has the
responsibility to expound on the issue personally, King reiterated.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs urged members of the public Friday to avoid
traveling to Thailand as clashes  between  pro-government  military  and  anti-
government protesters could break out at any time.</P>
      <P>The ministry meanwhile upgraded its travel alert to a "red" level for would-be
travelers to the Thai capital of Bangkok and neighboring provinces of
Nonthaburi, Samut Prakan, Nakhon Pathom, Pathum Thani and Ayutthaya. It
maintained an "orange" alert for travelers planning to visit four provinces in
southern Thailand.</P>
      <P>A red alert -- the highest in Taiwan's four-tier travel advisory system --
advises that no one should visit the affected destination under any
circumstances, while an "orange" alert advises would-be travelers to think of
their personal safety when deciding whether to visit.</P>
      <P>The ministry said it came to the decision based on a report on the situation
issued by Taiwan's representative office in Thailand.</P>
      <P>The Thai government has turned tougher against the "red-shirt" protesters --
mostly supporters of exiled Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra -- who have
economically paralyzed Bangkok and neighboring areas with their six-week long
demonstrations, the report said.</P>
      <P>Adding to the political uncertainty is that groups of people -- be they are
called "yellow-shirt, " "non-color" or "colorful" shirts -- are also taking to
the streets, and the Thai military has asked the protesters to disband or face a
second wave of "suppression," the report said.</P>
      <P>A wire service report indicated, however, that the Thai army may have changed
its strategy, with its commander-in-chief saying Friday that he does not plan to
use force to quell the demonstrations, because military action would result in
more disadvantages than advantages.</P>
      <P>Twenty-one demonstrators were killed and some 800 injured in a failed attempt by
the military on April 10 to disperse the protesters.</P>

      <P>The Fisheries Administration said Friday that it will respect the decision by a
group of eight Pacific island countries to ban fishing in 4.5 million square
kilometers of high seas in a bid to save rapidly depleting tuna stocks.</P>
      <P>Officials from the group known as the Parties to the Nauru Agreement (PNA) ,
which controls areas responsible for a quarter of the world's tuna supply,
agreed to extend the ban to new areas earlier in the day.</P>
      <P>Huang Hung-yen, a section chief at the Fisheries Administration, said Taiwan's
annual haul of tuna and similar fish in the Pacific is about 200,000 tons. The
figure constitutes one-sixth of the country's total coastal, deep-sea and
aquacultural fishing haul of 1.3 million tons.</P>
      <P>Huang said there are already two high sea areas in the Pacific that prohibit
fishing. In addition, large groups of fish often migrate into economic zones of
the island nations, where Taiwan's vessels have to pay for fishing rights.</P>
      <P>But if the vessels only fish in open sea areas, the fishing haul will be greatly
reduced, he said.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan will respect the decision by the Pacific island nations and operate  in
the areas with a spirit of cooperation  and coordination as in the past, " he

      <P>Scholars debated the possible benefits and disadvantages of a proposed cross-
Taiwan Strait trade agreement at a seminar Friday in a possible preview of
Sunday's showdown on the issue between President Ma Ying-jeou and the head of
the main opposition party.</P>
      <P>The seminar gathered university professors and researchers who both support and
oppose the signing of an economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) between
Taiwan and China, which Ma said he hopes to sign in June to prevent Taiwan from
being economically marginalized in the region.</P>
      <P>The 150-minute debate appeared to be a warm-up before Ma and opposition
Democratic Progressive Party Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen meet in a much-anticipated
nationally televised debate on the ECFA.</P>
      <P>If Taiwan does not take advantage of the China market, the world's biggest
market, it will be hard to make up for the "lost decade, " said Daniel Liu, a
senior researcher at the Chung-Hua Institution for Economic Research (CIER).</P>
      <P>He was referring to the period between 2000-2010 during which Taiwan  failed to
participate  in Asian economic  integration, especially in East Asia.</P>
      <P>Liu, who supports the trade pact, addressed at length objections raised by the
opposition to the deal, such as the possible influx of cheap Chinese labor, its
negative impact on agriculture and the pact's potential triggering of lower
wages in Taiwan based on factor-price equalization theory.</P>
      <P>The ECFA will be able to improve stability across the strait and be the starting
point of the institutionalization of cross-strait relations, he said, arguing
that the agreement "may not be the only way, but it will be an effective way to
improve Taiwan's economy."</P>
      <P>Wang To-far,  a professor of economics at National Taipei University who opposes
the ECFA, described it as China's first step toward enticing Taiwan to move
toward an eventual "one-China market" and economic integration before reaching
its ultimate goal of political integration.</P>
      <P>Wang argued that the government had exaggerated the benefits of the deal without
mentioning its possible adverse impact on employment and specific sectors, and
voiced concerns that the excessive reliance of Taiwan's investment and exports
on China's market would compromise the country's "economic sovereignty" in the
future.</P>
      <P>Lin Chu-chia, a professor of economics at National Chengchi University, was more
concerned, however, about the political tone of the arguments on the issue.</P>
      <P>"It seems to me that most people who support the agreement support it for
economic reasons, and people who are against the pact oppose it for political
reasons, " he said.</P>
      <P>"As an economist, I think we have to be rational and we have a responsibility to
tell the people what they're facing, " Lin said. "Unfortunately, the discussion
of this important agreement hasn't been rational in Taiwan."</P>

      <P>Five landscape sculptures created through an international environmental art
project were formally put on display Friday at the Cheng Long wetlands in
central-south Taiwan's Yunlin County to raise the public's environmental
awareness.</P>
      <P>All five installation sculptures were created by artists from home and abroad
with natural materials available from the wetlands, said Lin Hua-ching, an
ecological habitat management specialist with the Taiwan Forestry Bureau under
the Council of Agriculture.</P>
      <P>In the process, Lin said, local children and residents have been invited to work
together with domestic and foreign artists to find new possibilities for
development of their homeland.</P>
      <P>The 100-hectare Cheng Long wetland park was formed as a result of land
subsidence due to long years of excessive extraction of groundwater, Lin said.</P>
      <P>Owners  of 41 hectares  of the land agreed  to join the international
environmental art project organized by the Kuan Shu Educational Foundation with
a subsidy from the forestry bureau, Lin said.</P>
      <P>The project attracted submissions from 81 artists in 33 countries and five
entries were finally selected to be installed at the park.</P>
      <P>Wang Chao-mei, a Kuan Shu executive, said it was very interesting to see how
concepts changed and were developed after the artists came to the wetlands and
began their work.</P>
      <P>One of the works was sketched by American artist Roy Staab, Wang said. He worked
with local schoolchildren to make use of abundant oyster shells from the nearby
village and created a sort of drawing in the water with shells placed on bamboo
poles posted in the water.</P>
      <P>"The artwork is interesting to view at different times of day and from different
viewpoints," she said.</P>
      <P>The works will be displayed until July 25, Wang said, and then will return to
nature through weathering.</P>
      <P>"We hope the exhibition will help local residents find a new path for community
development in this sinking wetland," Wang said.</P>
      <P>Over the past year, Wang said the foundation has also sponsored a series of
ecological  exploration  programs  attended by local schoolchildren and
residents to help them better understand the importance of environmental
protection.</P>
      <P>The activities also included making wooden bird models to attract migrant birds
to the wetlands and environmental cleanup.</P>
      <P>"Our efforts have helped infuse new life into the wetland park, which now
attracts at least 86 migrating bird species annually, " Wang added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President  Ma Ying-jeou  is set to debate with opposition Democratic Progressive
Party Chairperson Tsai Ing-wen on Taiwan's proposed economic cooperation
framework agreement (ECFA) with China on Sunday.</P>
      <P>We hope their discussion will be based on substance rather than ideology.</P>
      <P>The first point that should be made clear is that this pact is nothing unique to
Taiwan and China. It is an agreement designed by the World Trade Organization
(WTO) as a transitional step toward a free trade pact. China inked such a pact
with ASEAN in 2003 before moving on to a free trade agreement in 2010.</P>
      <P>WTO members sign ECFAs to eliminate barriers between them. Anyone who claims
that Taiwan is downgrading itself by choosing an ECFA with China instead of a
free trade agreement is misleading the public.</P>
      <P>As a member of the WTO, Taiwan should follow the organization's rules in making
such deals -- not only with China, but with all members. Any debate on whether
Taiwan should strike such a deal with China is totally pointless.</P>
      <P>Then we have to ask: Is there any option other than ECFA to wipe out the trade
barriers between Taiwan and China? The answer is "no." Taiwan has only been
reaching out to China for two years, and therefore it is impossible to sign a
free trade agreement immediately.</P>
      <P>Although the elimination of trade barriers will bring benefits to both sides in
the long term, in the meantime the transformation will help industries that
benefit from competition and undermine those which aren't competitive.</P>
      <P>So the only issues worth debating are which industries will be negatively and
positively affected by an ECFA, to what extent they will be influenced, and
whether the gains will outweigh the losses.</P>
      <P>We hope the two debaters will focus on these points and inform the public of the
pros and cons of the deal. (April 23, 20100)</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou's spokesman rebutted Friday an accusation by opposition
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairperson Tsai Ing-wen that the ruling
Kuomintang (KMT) was the instigator of the latest brawl in the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Lo Chih-chiang said the remarks appeared to clash with the image Tsai works to
maintain of being a woman of integrity.</P>
      <P>Lo made the comment in response to a report carried that day in the Liberty
Times newspaper that cited Tasi as saying that the tension between the ruling
and opposition parties was deliberately fomented by the KMT.</P>
      <P>Amid the approach of a widely anticipated debate between Ma and Tsai slated for
April 25 on the proposed economic cooperation framework agreement with China,
"it is bad to deliberately stir up confrontation and conflict," Tsai was quoted
as saying.</P>
      <P>Lo noted that Tsai has a reputation for maintaining an image of being rational
and honest, but appears now to be describing "herself as the victim of a crime
she herself committed" -- a reference to the recent violent scuffles in the
Legislative Yuan blamed by the KMT on the DPP.</P>
      <P>The incident, which occurred April 21, ended with KMT Legislator Chao Li-yun,
who had been presiding over a meeting to screen two controversial education
bills that would pave the way for local universities to admit students from
China, being taken to hospital after briefly fainting after the brawl broke out.</P>
      <P>Ma later urged Tsai not to condone her party's disruption of legislative
proceedings. Regrettably, Lo said, Tsai was unrepentant and in fact accused the
KMT of being the side that started the fracas.</P>

      <P>A bill aimed at expediting the prosecution of criminal cases passed the
Legislative Yuan Friday, a measure legislators hope will prevent trials and
appeals from dragging on for more than a decade as occurs at present.</P>
      <P>Legislator Hsieh Kuo-liang, convener of the Judiciary and Organic Laws and
Statutes Committee, said he hoped the new statute would prevent the Supreme
Court from repeatedly remanding cases back to lower courts because of indecision
or minor flaws or stop prosecutors from filing endless appeals of not guilty
verdicts.</P>
      <P>The new law, which was passed with the support of both the ruling and opposition
parties, limits the period in which criminal cases -- including the initial
trial and all subsequent re-trials or appeals -- must be resolved to eight
years.</P>
      <P>The impetus for the bill has been a number of cases in Taiwan that have lasted
for a decade -- and even decades -- in some cases outlasting the criminals or
defendants involved.</P>
      <P>Under the new statute, if a case spends eight years in the courts without a
final resolution, the defendant will be released if he or she was found not
guilty in the most recent court ruling and be allowed to file for commutation of
the sentence if found guilty at that point in the process.</P>
      <P>By the same token, the defendant cannot be detained for more than eight years
prior to a final conviction.</P>
      <P>The new statute will also prohibit prosecutors from appealing a case if the
defendant is found not guilty at both the district court and high court level,
unless the ruling has serious technical flaws.</P>
      <P>The law will become binding two years after it is promulgated by the president,
to give the judiciary system time to prepare for it.</P>
      <P>Judiciary Yuan official Lin Chun-yi said there are currently 30 defendants who
have been detained for more than five years as their cases make their way
through the court system.</P>
      <P>He said the judiciary system will try to close their cases within the next two
years before the new statute takes effect.</P>

      <P>To protect Taiwanese farmers, agricultural products from China will not be
included in a planned cross-strait economic cooperation framework agreement's
(ECFA) "early harvest list," a Council of Agriculture official (COA) said
Friday.</P>
      <P>Hsiau  Dong-chong,  deputy  director-general  of the  COA's International
Cooperation Division, said that at the second round of ECFA negotiations, which
concluded April 1, China agreed not to demand further opening of Taiwan's market
for Chinese agricultural products or to include its farm products on the "early
harvest" list.</P>
      <P>The "early harvest list" refers to goods and services that will enjoy lower or
no tariffs if the ECFA is signed.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has maintained bans on the importation of 830 agricultural products from
China that were in effect when President Ma Ying-jeou took office on May 20,
2008, and will not reduce tariffs on the 1,415 agricultural items already
allowed, Hsiao said.</P>
      <P>She was responding to remarks by former National Policy Adviser Huang Yueh-sui
that Taiwan's agriculture and fishery sectors could suffer a heavy blow if an
ECFA is signed.</P>
      <P>Hsiau added that at the first round of ECFA talks in Beijing on Jan. 26, Taiwan
refused to discuss issues related to further opening Taiwan to Chinese
agricultural products.</P>
      <P>Costs are the main reason behind the government's decision to allow imports of
some types of agricultural products, Hsiao said.</P>
      <P>For example, Taiwan began allowing the importation of watermelon seeds from
China in 1989 because local farmers didn't show interest in the product due to
high production costs, Hsiao said. Statistics from 2007 show 7.97 hectares were
devoted to the plants, a figure that decreased to 1.06 hectares in 2008. There
was almost no production in 2009, she said.</P>
      <P>However, Taiwan still bans the import of Chinese watermelons, she pointed out.</P>
      <P>The opening to imports of Chinese Pu-erh tea leaves and garlic from China was
due to the fact they are not produced locally, or because of high transport
costs for imports from other countries, Hsiao added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Kaohsiung dry spell eases slightly</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A dry spell that threatens Kaohsiung water supplies eased slightly as the area
saw rains Friday morning.</P>
      <P>However, government officials said the rainfall was far from enough to help
reservoirs take in sufficient water to maintain a normal supply beyond June.</P>
      <P>Wu Yueh-si, the deputy director-general of the Water Resources Agency, said that
although the rain did not solve shortages, it helped provide some relief for
daily water use. "We are still waiting for more precipitation to come," Wu said.</P>
      <P>The rain started at around 6: 00 a.m. and fell mainly on the flatlands. As of 8:
00 a.m., it had rained the most in Gangshan City in Kaohsiung County, which saw
40 millimeters, local weathermen said. Kaohsiung City only received 3-4 mm and
mountainous areas only saw a drizzle.</P>
      <P>Taking advantage of the rainfall brought about by weather fronts that approached
Taiwan, WRA personnel produced some 10 mm of artificial rain.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the season's first crop of rice paddies benefited from the rainfall,
Wu said. However, it had little effect on the Kaoping River, a major river in
southern Taiwan's Kaohsiung and Pingtung counties.</P>
      <P>"We took about 930,000 tons of water from the Kaoping River on Friday, " Wu
said, adding that water supplies may only last several months.</P>
      <P>No rain has fallen in parts of southern Taiwan since Typhoon Morakot lashed that
part of the country last August. Spring rice planting in some areas of central
and southern Taiwan has been suspended to save water.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SEF chairman stresses urgency of cross-strait trade deal</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>04/23/10  19:47:03</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>"Taiwan must not delay the signing of a mutual tariff concession agreement with
China, as it is much easier to reach consensus on a limited list of items for
tariffs reduction or exemption than to conclude a comprehensive economic
cooperation pact," according to the chairman of the Straits Exchange Foundation
(SEF).</P>
      <P>In an interview with focustaiwan.tw, Chiang Pin-kung spoke of the urgency of
Taiwan signing the proposed economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) with
mainland China.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan's move to negotiate and sign an ECFA with the mainland is, first of all,
due to the current trend of fast-moving economic integration, " said Chiang.</P>
      <P>He stressed the need for an export-oriented economy to ensure that Taiwan can
compete on a fair footing in export markets and avoid being economically
marginalized.</P>
      <P>"To date, both sides of the Taiwan Strait have held two rounds of formal
negotiations on the ECFA and have achieved consensus on matters such as the
basic structure of clauses in the agreement and rules and positions pertaining
to the 'early harvest list' of goods and services," he added.</P>
      <P>Chiang, a former minister of economic affairs (1993-1996) , explained that the
"early harvest list" will cover only about 500 items. It will not include
products in sensitive sectors that may become vulnerable to competition when
more tariff-free imports are allowed into the domestic market.</P>
      <P>"The much misunderstood 'early harvest list' is designed to ease the impact of
tariff concessions on domestic industries and allow time for the economy to
adjust to a new trade policy,"he explained.</P>
      <P>Over the years, Taiwan has opened its market to 8,612 products from the Chinese
mainland, including 7,200 industrial items and 1,412 agricultural products. In
the ECFA negotiations on the "early harvest list", Taiwan has insisted that only
about 500 of the 1,378 industrial items still under import control will be
listed for tariff concessions and that none of the 830 restricted Chinese
agricultural items will be included, Chiang said.</P>
      <P>Chiang forecast  that Taiwan industries  will benefit from cross-strait
economic cooperation in areas such as investment protection, intellectual rights
protection and tariff concessions, under the ECFA with China.</P>
      <P>According to an SEF report, China was the largest market for Taiwan products in
2008, absorbing US$74 billion worth of exports at an average tariff rate of 9
percent. Meanwhile, Taiwan imported US$31.4 billion worth of goods from China in
2008 at an average tariff rate of 4 percent, the figures show.</P>
      <P>Since the average import tariff rate in China was relatively higher,  a cross-
strait  trade agreement  that includes tariff concessions would be in Taiwan's
favor, the report states.</P>
      <P>Stressing the urgency of the ECFA, Chiang said it could lead to bilateral trade
agreements with other Asian economies and that Taiwan may face fewer obstacles
in its pursuit of such pacts.</P>
      <P>"With the establishment of a free trade zone involving six members of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and mainland China on Jan. 1 this
year, products are flowing within that zone tariff-free, which puts Taiwan at a
disadvantage, " Chiang said.</P>
      <P>The Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) 7.0 data base has forecast that with
the formation of the ASEAN plus China tariff free zone, Taiwan may see a 0.176
percent drop in its gross domestic product, a 0.412 percent decline in exports
and a 0.601 percent fall in imports.</P>
      <P>As a matter of fact, since a free trade agreement between ASEAN and China took
effect in 2005, Taiwan products in the China market have been lagging behind
those of the 10 ASEAN member states.</P>
      <P>In 2004, China imported US$64.7 billion worth of products from Taiwan, while
imports from ASEAN amounted to US$62.9 billion. Last year, China's imports from
Taiwan amounted to US$85.7 billion, while those from ASEAN totaled US$106.2
billion.</P>
      <P>Statistics  compiled by Taiwan and China's customs offices indicate that in
2009, China's import tariffs on Taiwan petrochemical products averaged 6.49
percent, on machinery 8.23 percent, and on automobiles and auto parts 14.92
percent.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, petrochemical products from the ASEAN countries were subject to an
average 0.98 percent import tariffs at China's customs in 2009 and the rate has
been reduced further to an average 0.25 percent this year.</P>
      <P>China has also dropped the average tariff rate on machinery imports from the
ASEAN countries from 2.08 percent in 2009 to 0.07 percent in 2010, and on
automobiles and auto parts from 7.04 percent to 4.31 percent.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan government is hoping that the ECFA will help Taiwan products to
remain competitive in the Chinese market, according to Chiang. It is also
pushing for the service sector to be included on the ECFA "early harvest list"
so that it can maintain its competitive edge, he added.</P>
      <P>The SEF chairman noted that Taiwan and China last year signed three memorandums
of understanding (MOUs) on financial supervision, which allows banking,
insurance, and securities and futures firms to conduct business in each others
territory. However, there are issues related to a difference in market access
thresholds, as defined by the World Trade Organization (WTO) , that need to be
resolved, he added.</P>
      <P>According to WTO regulations, Taiwan as a developed economy has lower market
access threshold compared to developing economies, including China. But Chiang
said the market access issue can also be resolved in the negotiation of the
trade agreement between Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>Admitting  that certain  local industries  would  encounter unprecedented
competition from Chinese products with the signing of the ECFA, Chiang said that
the Taiwan government has worked out a series of remedial measures in line with
WTO regulations in order to protect the vulnerable sectors.</P>
      <P>These include anti-dumping  duties,  countervailing  duties, compensatory
duties, and subsidies to certain disadvantaged sectors, he added.</P>
      <P>While the government has been trying to find ways for Taiwan's industries  to
maintain their competitiveness,  discussions  by politicians, in the media, and
in various economic sectors reflect the general concerns that persist over the
negative impact of the proposed ECFA.</P>
      <P>But Chiang thinks that some of the arguments are colored by ideological
orientations.</P>
      <P>"It is possible that there is some confusion over 'technical terms' such as
'early harvest list', but regrettably some of the negative responses to the
proposed trade pact are spurred by ideologically oriented arguments," Chiang
said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's pro-independence camp filed a new petition Friday for a referendum on
the proposed economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) with China, eight
months after their previous bid was rejected.</P>
      <P>The latest petition, initiated by the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) and other
groups, was submitted to the Central Election Commission (CEC) with signatures
of 110,000 supporters.</P>
      <P>TSU officials said in a news conference earlier in the day that a second-phase
signature drive will be launched next week, with the goal of collecting 1
million signatures.</P>
      <P>Former President Lee Teng-hui, the TSU's spiritual leader, set the goal even
higher at 2 million signatures.</P>
      <P>Lee argued that the ECFA would be disastrous for Taiwan because it is not an
agreement between sovereign states, but one that is similar to the Closer
Economic Partnership Arrangement between China and the special administrative
regions of Hong Kong and Macau.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, the ECFA is part of China's plot to annex Taiwan under the
pretense of economic cooperation.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese people should be given a say on the ECFA issue so that they can decide
their own fate, he added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Su Jia-chuan, secretary-general of the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) , threatened to launch extensive protests against the
administration of President Ma Ying-jeou if it again blocks the referendum bid
and insists on going ahead with its plan to sign the agreement with China in
June.</P>
      <P>The previous initiative for a referendum on the ECFA was filed by the DPP in
July last year, with the proposed question: "Do you agree that the government
should hold a referendum to allow the people to decide on the signing of a
Taiwan-China ECFA?"</P>
      <P>The initiative, however, was rejected by the Cabinet's Referendum Screening
Committee one month later. The committee said it was based on a hypothetical
situation and did not meet the criteria of the Referendum Law.</P>
      <P>In the latest petition, the proposed question has been rephrased to: "Do you
agree with the government's plan to sign an ECFA with China?"</P>
      <P>Upon receiving the TSU's referendum petition, CEC Spokesman Teng Tien-yu said
the CEC will meet May 4 to determine if the new proposal meets legal
requirements.</P>
      <P>Under the Referendum Law, a referendum proposal must pass two thresholds to be
accepted. In the initial stage, signatures from 0.5 percent, or 86,608, of the
17,321,622 eligible voters in the last presidential election must be collected.</P>
      <P>If a referendum screening committee finds that the proposed referendum conforms
to legal guidelines, the referendum's initiators then need to collect signatures
from 5 percent, or 866,081 eligible voters, for the question to be put to
referendum.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOI promises to address shortage of social workers in Taiwan</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of the Interior (MOI) plans to subsidize the hiring of more social
workers by local governments after controversy over a recent mother and daughter
murder-suicide brought to light the severe shortage of such workers in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The MOI said Friday that there are currently 1,688 social workers on government
payrolls, far from the number needed, and before their ranks can be replenished,
the ministry will continue to provide subsidies to help local governments
recruit new people.</P>
      <P>Local governments are responsible for hiring social workers, but because  many
of them are currently  facing serious financial constraints, they cannot afford
to hire more people to meet actual needs, causing the quality of social services
to suffer, the ministry noted.</P>
      <P>That decline in quality and the difficulties social workers face gained public
exposure recently when a mother killed herself and her daughter despite the
daughter's attempt to seek assistance.</P>
      <P>Social workers generally were blamed for the tragedy, but amid mounting
criticism, more than 100 social workers mobilized by a group trying to form a
union staged protests outside the MOI and the Executive Yuan Friday.</P>
      <P>The group complained that the government "took the lead" in blaming them for the
incident by describing them as not being proactive enough, lacking experience,
showing poor judgment, and acting negligently.</P>
      <P>The protesters countered that the government was unaware of the inadequacies and
flaws in its policies and demanded that a long-term and stable hiring system for
social workers be established as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The MOI said that to strengthen the ranks of social workers at the local
government level, the central government has subsidized the hiring of an
additional 320 social workers to protect children and teenagers and 190 social
workers to attend to domestic violence and sexual offense cases since 2006.</P>
      <P>Since 2008, it has used part of the proceeds from the public welfare lottery to
help local governments increase their staffing of social workers to strengthen
services for children, teenagers, women, the elderly and the physically and
mentally challenged, the MOI said.</P>

      <P>Holland's envoy to Taiwan, Menno Goedhart, said Friday that he and his wife have
decided to make Taiwan their home after he retires.</P>
      <P>At the launch of his new book "The Real Taiwan and the Dutch" at Fort Provintia
in Tainan City, Goedhart said he and his wife will resettle in the southern
township of Sinhua in Tainan County when his tenure as the Netherlands' top
envoy to Taiwan ends later this year.</P>
      <P>Over the past eight years, Goedhart has visited almost every corner of the
Taiwan -- including some areas that are unfamiliar to many Taiwanese -- to trace
the footprints of his ancestors who ruled Taiwan between 1524 and 1662.</P>
      <P>During that period, some citizens of Holland married local aborigines, mostly
from the Rukai tribe that is one the 10-odd recognized indigenous groups in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Goedhart, who has built a close friendship with the Rukai people, was given an
"elder" title by the tribe in Shantimen township in Pingtung. He is one of two
foreign citizens on whom the Rukai bestowed the title, the first being also a
Hollander who was given the honor in the early 20th century.</P>
      <P>Goedhart's book, published in Chinese and English, features many of Taiwan's
most attractive destinations, including the counties of Hualien and Taitung in
eastern Taiwan, the cities and counties of Tainan and Chiayi in the central part
and the offshore Penghu County. It also focuses on the indigenous tribes around
the country.</P>
      <P>According to Goedhart, he plans to make his home in Tainan when he retires and
to travel around Taiwan promoting his book. All proceeds from the book will to
be donated to the victims of Typhoon Morakot which devastated parts of eastern
and southern Taiwan last August, he added.</P>
      <P>At the book launch, Tainan Mayor Hsu Tain-tsair dubbed Goedhart as "the Marco
Polo of Taiwan, " citing the envoy's ambitious plan to sell Taiwan to the rest
of the world.</P>
      <P>Marco Polo was a Venetian merchant and adventurer who visited China in the 13th
century and wrote a book called "Il Milione di Marco Polo, " which gave

      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih said Friday that the government has helped reduce the jobless
rate and allowed as many as 220,000 people on unpaid leave to return to their
jobs over the past year.</P>
      <P>The premier noted that the unemployment rate hit an all-time high of 6.13
percent in August 2009, the highest on record since the government began
compiling unemployment statistics in 1978. The figure dropped to 5.64 percent
last month.</P>
      <P>The government is pushing for a "velvet revolution" to quickly drive down
unemployment rates, he said.</P>
      <P>Public efforts over the past year have reversed and changed many figures, the
premier continued.</P>
      <P>He cited the jobless rate in industrial zones as an example, saying that between
February and March in 2009, there were nearly 230,000 on unpaid leave, but that
the number has since dropped to less than 3,000, and would continue to drop.</P>
      <P>In the science-based parks, the number on unpaid leaves peaked at 126,000, but
now stands at under 100, he said.</P>
      <P>The premier said earlier in the week that he will resign if Taiwan's
unemployment rate remains above 5 percent by the end of this year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Japan finally opens market to Taiwan-grown dragon fruit: COA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 23 (CNA)
04/23/10  21:19:02

    <TEXT>
      <P>Japan has decided to allow imports of Taiwan dragon fruit, after more than nine
years of effort on Taiwan's part to gain access to that market, the Council of
Agriculture (COA) announced Friday.</P>
      <P>"The Japanese Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries issued an official
notice April 16 on its decision to allow the entry of Taiwan-grown dragon fruit,
" said Ko Wen-chun, a section chief at the COA's Bureau of Animal and Plant
Health Inspection and Quarantine (BAPHIQ).</P>
      <P>Over the past 10 years, Ko said, dragon fruit (Hylocereus undatus) has emerged
as one of most popular fruit species in Taiwan. It is grown throughout the
country on a total acreage of 800 hectares, with the central and southern parts
of the country being the main areas of production.</P>
      <P>An annual output is 15,158 tons and is valued about NT$420 million (US$13.38
million), Ko said.</P>
      <P>Given Taiwan's outstanding breeding, cultivation and management technologies,
its dragon fruit variety is superior to those grown in southeast Asian
countries, in terms of color, taste and texture, he added.</P>
      <P>"Our dragon fruit has great market potential, but it has to pass rigorous
quarantine checks before it can be exported to Japan, " Ko said.</P>
      <P>Because the Oriental fruit fly and melon fly are found in Taiwan, it has been
difficult for Taiwan to obtain permission to export its dragon fruit, which
hosts those pests, to Japan, Ko said.</P>
      <P>In 2001, the quarantine bureau managed to develop a special dragon fruit
disinfection  technology and in 2003 developed a high-temperature steaming
technology to kill fruit flies on dragon fruit.</P>
      <P>"We then filed an application with Japan in 2004 for dragon fruit exports and
finally passed Japan's stringent quarantine examinations this year, " Ko said,
adding that shipments to Japan are expected to hit 100 tons in the first year.</P>
      <P>Noting that the types of Taiwan-grown fruit exported to Japan has continued to
expand in recent years, Ko said Taiwan now exports about 11,000 tons of fresh
fruits to Japan annually, worth about NT$670 million. The different types of
fruits include mangoes, grapes, papayas, mandarin orange, pomelo, lychees,
bananas and pineapples.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has also applied to Japan for permission to export star fruit,
cantaloupe, guava, pears and Indian dates. However, Japan has not yet completed
screening of those applications, he said, adding that the bureau is now
developing disinfection technologies for bell fruit and pineapple-custard apple.</P>

      <P>Lu Yen-hsun, Taiwan's top-ranked tennis player, advanced to the semifinals of
the Status Athens Open Friday with a flawless 6-4, 6-1 victory over Japan's
Yuichi Sugita.</P>
      <P>The eighth-seeded Lu has yet to lose a set in his first three matches at the
85,000 euro ATP Challenger event and remained sharp against his Japanese
quarterfinal opponent, winning the match without ever facing a break point.</P>
      <P>Lu, ranked 102nd in the world, got in an uncharacteristically high 77 percent of
first serves and broke Sugita four times to coast to victory in just over an
hour.</P>
      <P>He will now meet world No. 257 Gilles Muller of Luxembourg in Saturday's
semifinals, as he pursues his first tournament title since winning another
Challenger event (second-tier events on the men's tennis tour) in South Korea
last November.</P>
      <P>Lu reached a career best ranking of 55 last June, but it has since tumbled to
around 100 because he has played more main ATP Tour events against the world's
best players since the middle of last year, with mixed results.</P>
      <P>Teamed with Rik de Voest of South Africa, the 26-year-old Taiwanese has also
reached the semifinals of the doubles event in Athens, after defeating top seeds
Leos Friedl and David Skoch of the Czech Republic 6-1, 6-0 on Thursday.</P>

    <HEADLINE>March industrial production reaches new high: MOEA</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's industrial production index reached a record high in March and grew at
a double-digit clip for the fifth consecutive month, the Ministry of Economic
Affairs (MOEA) reported Friday.</P>
      <P>The index rose 39.2 percent year-on-year in March to a record 120.30. It also
registered 47.1 percent annual growth in the first quarter, the MOEA said in a
statement.</P>
      <P>The MOEA attributed the continuing rise in industrial production to the global
economy's steady recovery and growing cross-Taiwan Strait trade activity.</P>
      <P>The improving economy was also reflected in the 42 percent rise in the
manufacturing production index in March.</P>
      <P>Among individual product categories, the production index for electronic parts
and components increased by 77.3 percent, leading all categories, while the
indexes for motor vehicles and parts, and machinery climbed 63.8 percent and
58.5 percent, respectively, according to MOEA figures.</P>
      <P>The electronic parts and components production  index also increased by 100.6
percent in the first quarter from the same period last year.</P>
      <P>The robust growth received a major boost from the recent launches of products
featuring new technology and the need to replenish parts inventories, the MOEA
noted.</P>
      <P>Because electronic industry inventories  have remained low, recently, with some
components in short supply, the production of semiconductors,  flat panels and
optoelectronic  materials rose considerably to meet heavy demand, it added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A top Kuomintang official criticized the opposition Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) Friday for avoiding any mention of possible benefits that a proposed trade
pact with China might bring to Taiwan, as a debate on the issue between the
leaders of the two parties looms.</P>
      <P>KMT Secretary-General King Pu-tsung accused the DPP for overly politicizing a
planned economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) between Taiwan and
China.</P>
      <P>He said that in Sunday's debate on the ECFA between President Ma Ying-jeou, who
doubles as the KMT's chairman, and DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen, Ma will explain
how the government is trying to push the trade accord to give Taiwan a path of
sustainable development.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, the DPP's anti-ECFA proposals are aimed at pressuring Ma to
step down, King argued.</P>
      <P>The DPP should keep in mind that in a democracy, the minority must follow the
majority, and the DPP should therefore work to seek more mainstream support,
King said.</P>
      <P>He also criticized Tsai for attempting to obfuscate the issue by using
"political language, " saying that calling on DPP supporters to boycott the
proposed trade accord is related to politics rather than to the policy.</P>
      <P>While the KMT is taking the ECFA seriously as a policy issue for debate, it is
regretful that Tsai, who usually acts rationally, is attempting to turn it into
a political issue, King contended.</P>
      <P>The upcoming debate between Ma and Tsai on the trade pact has already drawn
media attention from around the world because in many countries, the head of
state rarely participates in a debate with the opposition, according to King.</P>
      <P>Because the trade pact will be beneficial to Taiwan and a critical element in
its economic development in the coming decade, the president felt he has the
responsibility to expound on the issue personally, King reiterated.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs urged members of the public Friday to avoid
traveling to Thailand as clashes  between  pro-government  military  and  anti-
government protesters could break out at any time.</P>
      <P>The ministry meanwhile upgraded its travel alert to a "red" level for would-be
travelers to the Thai capital of Bangkok and neighboring provinces of
Nonthaburi, Samut Prakan, Nakhon Pathom, Pathum Thani and Ayutthaya. It
maintained an "orange" alert for travelers planning to visit four provinces in
southern Thailand.</P>
      <P>A red alert -- the highest in Taiwan's four-tier travel advisory system --
advises that no one should visit the affected destination under any
circumstances, while an "orange" alert advises would-be travelers to think of
their personal safety when deciding whether to visit.</P>
      <P>The ministry said it came to the decision based on a report on the situation
issued by Taiwan's representative office in Thailand.</P>
      <P>The Thai government has turned tougher against the "red-shirt" protesters --
mostly supporters of exiled Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra -- who have
economically paralyzed Bangkok and neighboring areas with their six-week long
demonstrations, the report said.</P>
      <P>Adding to the political uncertainty is that groups of people -- be they are
called "yellow-shirt, " "non-color" or "colorful" shirts -- are also taking to
the streets, and the Thai military has asked the protesters to disband or face a
second wave of "suppression," the report said.</P>
      <P>A wire service report indicated, however, that the Thai army may have changed
its strategy, with its commander-in-chief saying Friday that he does not plan to
use force to quell the demonstrations, because military action would result in
more disadvantages than advantages.</P>
      <P>Twenty-one demonstrators were killed and some 800 injured in a failed attempt by
the military on April 10 to disperse the protesters.</P>

      <P>The Fisheries Administration said Friday that it will respect the decision by a
group of eight Pacific island countries to ban fishing in 4.5 million square
kilometers of high seas in a bid to save rapidly depleting tuna stocks.</P>
      <P>Officials from the group known as the Parties to the Nauru Agreement (PNA) ,
which controls areas responsible for a quarter of the world's tuna supply,
agreed to extend the ban to new areas earlier in the day.</P>
      <P>Huang Hung-yen, a section chief at the Fisheries Administration, said Taiwan's
annual haul of tuna and similar fish in the Pacific is about 200,000 tons. The
figure constitutes one-sixth of the country's total coastal, deep-sea and
aquacultural fishing haul of 1.3 million tons.</P>
      <P>Huang said there are already two high sea areas in the Pacific that prohibit
fishing. In addition, large groups of fish often migrate into economic zones of
the island nations, where Taiwan's vessels have to pay for fishing rights.</P>
      <P>But if the vessels only fish in open sea areas, the fishing haul will be greatly
reduced, he said.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan will respect the decision by the Pacific island nations and operate  in
the areas with a spirit of cooperation  and coordination as in the past, " he
added.</P>

      <P>Scholars debated the possible benefits and disadvantages of a proposed cross-
Taiwan Strait trade agreement at a seminar Friday in a possible preview of
Sunday's showdown on the issue between President Ma Ying-jeou and the head of
the main opposition party.</P>
      <P>The seminar gathered university professors and researchers who both support and
oppose the signing of an economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) between
Taiwan and China, which Ma said he hopes to sign in June to prevent Taiwan from
being economically marginalized in the region.</P>
      <P>The 150-minute debate appeared to be a warm-up before Ma and opposition
Democratic Progressive Party Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen meet in a much-anticipated
nationally televised debate on the ECFA.</P>
      <P>If Taiwan does not take advantage of the China market, the world's biggest
market, it will be hard to make up for the "lost decade, " said Daniel Liu, a
senior researcher at the Chung-Hua Institution for Economic Research (CIER).</P>
      <P>He was referring to the period between 2000-2010 during which Taiwan  failed to
participate  in Asian economic  integration, especially in East Asia.</P>
      <P>Liu, who supports the trade pact, addressed at length objections raised by the
opposition to the deal, such as the possible influx of cheap Chinese labor, its
negative impact on agriculture and the pact's potential triggering of lower
wages in Taiwan based on factor-price equalization theory.</P>
      <P>The ECFA will be able to improve stability across the strait and be the starting
point of the institutionalization of cross-strait relations, he said, arguing
that the agreement "may not be the only way, but it will be an effective way to
improve Taiwan's economy."</P>
      <P>Wang To-far,  a professor of economics at National Taipei University who opposes
the ECFA, described it as China's first step toward enticing Taiwan to move
toward an eventual "one-China market" and economic integration before reaching
its ultimate goal of political integration.</P>
      <P>Wang argued that the government had exaggerated the benefits of the deal without
mentioning its possible adverse impact on employment and specific sectors, and
voiced concerns that the excessive reliance of Taiwan's investment and exports
on China's market would compromise the country's "economic sovereignty" in the
future.</P>
      <P>Lin Chu-chia, a professor of economics at National Chengchi University, was more
concerned, however, about the political tone of the arguments on the issue.</P>
      <P>"It seems to me that most people who support the agreement support it for
economic reasons, and people who are against the pact oppose it for political
reasons, " he said.</P>
      <P>"As an economist, I think we have to be rational and we have a responsibility to
tell the people what they're facing, " Lin said. "Unfortunately, the discussion
of this important agreement hasn't been rational in Taiwan."</P>

      <P>Five landscape sculptures created through an international environmental art
project were formally put on display Friday at the Cheng Long wetlands in
central-south Taiwan's Yunlin County to raise the public's environmental
awareness.</P>
      <P>All five installation sculptures were created by artists from home and abroad
with natural materials available from the wetlands, said Lin Hua-ching, an
ecological habitat management specialist with the Taiwan Forestry Bureau under
the Council of Agriculture.</P>
      <P>In the process, Lin said, local children and residents have been invited to work
together with domestic and foreign artists to find new possibilities for
development of their homeland.</P>
      <P>The 100-hectare Cheng Long wetland park was formed as a result of land
subsidence due to long years of excessive extraction of groundwater, Lin said.</P>
      <P>Owners  of 41 hectares  of the land agreed  to join the international
environmental art project organized by the Kuan Shu Educational Foundation with
a subsidy from the forestry bureau, Lin said.</P>
      <P>The project attracted submissions from 81 artists in 33 countries and five
entries were finally selected to be installed at the park.</P>
      <P>Wang Chao-mei, a Kuan Shu executive, said it was very interesting to see how
concepts changed and were developed after the artists came to the wetlands and
began their work.</P>
      <P>One of the works was sketched by American artist Roy Staab, Wang said. He worked
with local schoolchildren to make use of abundant oyster shells from the nearby
village and created a sort of drawing in the water with shells placed on bamboo
poles posted in the water.</P>
      <P>"The artwork is interesting to view at different times of day and from different
viewpoints," she said.</P>
      <P>The works will be displayed until July 25, Wang said, and then will return to
nature through weathering.</P>
      <P>"We hope the exhibition will help local residents find a new path for community
development in this sinking wetland," Wang said.</P>
      <P>Over the past year, Wang said the foundation has also sponsored a series of
ecological  exploration  programs  attended by local schoolchildren and
residents to help them better understand the importance of environmental
protection.</P>
      <P>The activities also included making wooden bird models to attract migrant birds
to the wetlands and environmental cleanup.</P>
      <P>"Our efforts have helped infuse new life into the wetland park, which now
attracts at least 86 migrating bird species annually, " Wang added.</P>

      <P>Some 10,000 Chinese Goshawk (or Chinese sparrow hawk) passed over the Kenting
area Thursday, allowing local and foreign visitors to gain a glance of the
migratory birds as they fly northward after having wintered in the south.</P>
      <P>Some Malaysian visitors shrieked in joy as they watched large flocks of the bird
flying over the skies of Kenting -- a hot tourist destination in southern
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The Chinese Goshawk breeds in Korea and southeast China, and winters in
Indonesia and the Philippines, passing through the rest of Southeast Asia,
including Taiwan. As many as 1000,000 and 200,000 sparrow hawks fly through the
area in autumn.</P>
      <P>"This was the first time in spring that large flocks of the birds were seen
flying over the area, " Tsai I-jung, an official of the Kenting National Park
Headquarters, said Friday.</P>
      <P>"We now know that there are more Chinese Goshawk at the Lingshiao Pagoda within
Sheding Park, which is the best vantage point in Kenting from which to watch the
birds," Tsai said.</P>
      <P>He explained that because it rained Friday in the Kaohsiung area, the flocks of
Chinese Goshawk might fly to neighboring Pingtung County or Taitung County
before they continue migrating north.</P>
      <P>According to Tsai, local researchers have been unable to collect sufficient
information to understand how many birds fly over Kenting on their way north
during the spring, as they had seldom appeared in large numbers in Kenting
during the season.</P>
      <P>In contrast, researchers have collected a wealth of information about the bird
when it flies over Kenting in autumn on its way southward to winter in some
southeast Asian countries, he said.</P>
      <P>The bird usually passes through Kenting before mid-September, with 20,000-30,000
potentially flying over Kenting in a single day.</P>

      <P>Taiwanese singing sensation Lin Yu-chun returned home early Saturday after
concluding a high-profile visit to the United States during which he appeared on
two popular talk shows.</P>
      <P>Lin told reporters upon his arrival at the Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport
that he was both happy and nervous about his TV debuts in the United States and
was "flattered" by the courtesy he had received.</P>
      <P>"The biggest gain of the visit was allowing more people to see Taiwan, " Lin
said. "Many people greeted me by saying 'Hi, Taiwan boy!' when I walked on the
streets."</P>
      <P>The talent show contestant, who shot to fame when a video of him singing Whitney
Houston's version of "I Will Always Love You" was posted on YouTube and received
millions of views, said he will seek to sharpen his singing skills and improve
his physical posture and strength to pave the way for his future career as a
professional performer.</P>
      <P>However, Lin said he does not have any plans to lose weight, adding that he was
afraid people might not recognize him if he slimmed down.</P>
      <P>Excited to be on the same flight with the celebrity, many passengers said they
had had their photos taken with him while on the plane. There were also fans who
greeted him at the airport lobby.</P>
      <P>The main purpose of the U.S. visit, mainly in Los Angeles, was to perform and do
interviews on the Ellen DeGeneres Show and Lopez Tonight.</P>
      <P>Lin again impressed his audience when he sang "I Will Always Love You" on the
Ellen DeGeneres Show.</P>
      <P>The video showing him singing the song on a Taiwanese talent show "Million Star"
went viral soon after it was posted on YouTube April 6, with immediate
comparisons between Lin and British singing sensation Susan Boyle, who rose to
stardom after auditioning for "Britain's Got Talent" last year.</P>
      <P>Lin was also well-received on the Lopez Tonight show when he did a duet of
Bonnie Tyler's "Total Eclipse of the Heart" with William Shatner of U.S. popular
TV series Star Trek fame.</P>
      <P>His performance of Houston's "Saving All My Love For You" on Lopez Tonight  was
also highly  praised,  with videos of his performances on the show widely shared

    <HEADLINE>Economic Daily News: New paradigm impossible in ECFA debate</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>04/24/10  15:49:13
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The upcoming debate between President Ma Ying-jeou and opposition Democratic
Progressive  Party (DPP)  Chairperson  Tsai Ing-wen originally stood a chance of
building a new paradigm in Taiwan's democracy history. It is a pity that this
has become impossible in reality.</P>
      <P>Even before the debate on the proposed Taiwan-China economic cooperation
framework agreement (ECFA) begins, the DPP has stated that regardless of its
outcome, it will push for a demonstration and referendum against the trade pact.
It appears that the DPP's sole purpose of taking part in the debate is to
justify its further struggle against the Ma administration. In this case, is
there still room for rational discussions?</P>
      <P>The DPP has been manipulating the ECFA issue by accusing Ma of "leaning toward
China and selling out Taiwan." However, can we deal with an issue that concerns
Taiwan's future and survival in such a simple, emotional, populist, bellicose
and ideological manner?</P>
      <P>The debate should be more than just a debate and should allow for in-depth
discussions on Taiwan's future and survival. Topics involved may include
globalization,  regional economic organizations and China's dominant status in
the global manufacturing and global market. Others are the diminishing U.S. role
in international affairs, a shift to "peaceful development" in China's Taiwan
policy, and the collapse  of the Taiwan  independence  course in the
international context.</P>
      <P>Only if Ma and Tsai bear these backdrops in mind would they be able to prevent
the debate from becoming a superficial political struggle and find a way out for
Taiwan. (April 24, 2010)</P>

    <HEADLINE>Talk of the day -- Speedy criminal law</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>04/24/10  16:02:37
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan approved the Fair and Speedy Criminal Trials Act Friday,
which will limit the prosecution of criminal cases in the courts to no more than
eight years.</P>
      <P>Also, in cases that have not been resolved after eight years, either the
defendant will be freed if the most recent ruling was "not guilty" or be allowed
to file for a commutation of the sentence if the most recent verdict was guilty.</P>
      <P>The measure will take effect two years after being promulgated by President Ma
Ying-jeou.</P>
      <P>In a bid not to waste judicial resources, the law will also prohibit prosecutors
from appealing a criminal case if a defendant is acquitted of the charges in
both the district and high courts, or the case has been remanded to a lower
court more than three times. This measure will take effect from September 1.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts of local media's coverage of the story:</P>
      <P>The Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>Supreme Court President Yang Yen-shou said Friday that the Supreme Court has
started handling cases more quickly and estimates it could close about 4,500
cases in two years.</P>
      <P>Presidential Office spokesman Lo Chih-chiang said President Ma Ying-jeou was
glad to see that Taiwan's human rights have taken a big step forward and voiced
hope that the judicial system could handle cases "adequately" and "rapidly."</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Justice (MOJ) pointed out Friday that the law will strip
prosecutors of their right to appeal. Although the ministry said it respects the
Legislative Yuan's decision to pass the law, it worried that the law will also
affect the right to appeal of those involved.</P>
      <P>Some senior prosecutors ascribed Taiwan's much maligned lengthy trials to the
Supreme Court, accusing it of frequently invalidating the rulings of lower
courts simply based on minor technical details.</P>
      <P>The Judicial Reform Foundation, however, was skeptical about the effectiveness
of the impact of the new statute on judicial reform.</P>
      <P>The law will not help lengthy cases be settled quickly unless the defendants
plea guilty, said a spokesman for the association.</P>
      <P>A lawyer contended that the law, without complementary measures, would more
favorable to the defendants due to the time limit on trials. (April 24, 2010)</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>The statute  was established  in line  with  international conventions and
legislation by other countries to allow defendants to be treated and tried
fairly.</P>
      <P>Robert Tsao, the former UMC chairman who is still being pursued in court by
prosecutors despite being found "not guilty" of illegally investing in China,
said that while the law will impose greater restrictions on prosecutors, they
still possess too much power.</P>
      <P>Judicial Yuan President Lai In-jaw, however, hailed the law as a hallmark in the
history of Taiwan's human rights. He urged the judges to accelerate the pace of
handling cases based on the principle of "presumption of innocence" and "quick
sentencing." (April 24, 2010)</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Justice (MOJ) expressed regret Friday over passage of the law
that will restrict prosecutors' power to appeal. It asked the Judicial Yuan to
swiftly come up with complementary measures to deal with widespread concern that
the rights of victims could be hurt.</P>
      <P>Civic groups advocating a judicial overhaul, meanwhile, contended that the law
was only designed to clear up old cases while turning a blind eye to unworthy
judges who ignore their official duties at the expense of the victims' human and
appeal rights. (April 24, 2010)</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan's people conserved large amount of water last year</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 24 (CNA)
04/24/10  16:09:17
(By Lin Hui-chun and Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's people consumed 271 kiloliters of water per person in 2009, three
kiloliters less than the previous year, saving a larger amount of water compared
to previous years, according to statistics released by the Water Resources
Agency (WRA) Saturday.</P>
      <P>The amount of water saved represented the best water conservation results over
the past 19 years, the WRA said. Water consumption is calculated on water
consumed at homes and in work places, or during commercial and leisure
activities.</P>
      <P>Water consumption by government agencies and schools last year was down by 2.4
percent from 2008, showing the government's campaign to conserve water has borne
fruit, the WRA said.</P>
      <P>Per capita water consumption in Taiwan surpassed 272 kiloliters a day in 1991, a
time when Taiwan was experiencing rapid economic growth, and then grew by years
to the peak of 291 kiloliter.</P>
      <P>But due to a government policy to cut water use to under 250 kiloliters per
people per day, water consumption has gradually decreased yearly.</P>
      <P>This year, southern Taiwan is facing a drought. Taiwan Water Corp., announced
earlier this week that water rationing might be imposed in the greater Tainan
area by mid-June if the ongoing drought in the region persists.</P>
      <P>With the specter of water rationing in southern Taiwan looming, the Ministry of
Economic Affairs has provided preferential water fees to those who conserve
water.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that the amount of water conserved has surpassed 30 million tons
in the first quarter, or one third of the effective accommodation of Nanhua
Reservoir, a major reservoir in southern Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>'Chinese Taipei': Ex-Olympic head's controversial legacy</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>04/24/10  16:52:59</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The name "Chinese Taipei, " which allows Taiwan entry in many international
events, is one of the most controversial achievements of late International
Olympics Committee (IOC) head Juan Antonio Samaranch, who passed away Wednesday
at the age of 89.</P>
      <P>The former Spanish diplomat, who died of cardio-respiratory failure in
Barcelona, Spain, was instrumental in devising the "Chinese Taipei" formula in
1981 that allowed Taiwan to participate in the Games, after the IOC decided in
1979 that China's Beijing Olympic Committee would become the "Chinese Olympic
Committee."</P>
      <P>"The clever technical arrangement by Samaranch made possible the co-existence of
Taiwan and China in sporting competitions and set up Taiwan's return to the
Olympics, " said Wu Ching-kuo, the only IOC member from Taiwan and chairman  of
the International  Boxing Association, in a statement Thursday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan first competed as Chinese Taipei under the Chinese Taipei Olympics
Committee flag in the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. Since then it has
participated in almost all international sporting events and some international
organizations under the name.</P>
      <P>Huang Chih-hsiung, a ruling Kuomintang (KMT) legislator and silver medalist in
taekwondo at the 2004 Athens Olympics, has said that Taiwan should keep politics
out of sports.</P>
      <P>But it's  not always  easy.</P>
      <P>As China squeezes Taiwan's international  maneuvering room, organizations
increasingly refer to Taiwan as "Chinese Taipei, " including  the Asia Pacific
Economic  Cooperation  forum,  the Organization  for Economic  Co-operation  and
Development,  the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the World
Health Organization, among others.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has also been called "Chinese Taipei" at Lions Club International events,
the Miss World and Miss Universe pageants, the World Baseball Classic and the
Little League World Series.</P>
      <P>Opposition  Democratic  Progressive  Party  Legislator  Chai Trong-rong
contends  that the name "Chinese Taipei" sends an inaccurate message to the
international community.</P>
      <P>The name, he argues, suggests that Taiwan is happy and willing to accept the
arrangement, which he compares to the status of "Hong Kong, China."</P>
      <P>Samaranch's legacy has caused another problem:  translating "Chinese Taipei"
into Chinese. While China translated it as "Zhongguo Taipei," suggesting that
Taiwan is a part of China, Taiwan translated it as "Zhonghua Taipei, " where the
translation for "Chinese" refers to a cultural entity rather than a state.</P>
      <P>Chinese President Hu Jintao first publicly referred to Taiwan as "Chinese
Taipei" when he met then-KMT Chairman Wu Po-hsiung in May 2009.  The
unprecedented  move  signified  important  political implications  in cross-
Taiwan  Strait  relations,  Beijing-based researcher Xiao Yongguo wrote in an
analysis for China Review News agency.</P>
      <P>Hu's remark implied the possibility of mutual non-denial between China and
Taiwan and underlined a chance for Taiwan to participate in the international
community under the name Chinese Taipei while handling domestic affairs under
the ROC Constitution, he said.</P>
      <P>Thus, the name "Chinese Taipei" has created a path for Taiwan and China to co-
exist in the political arena, Xiao concluded.</P>
      <P>IOC member Wu, who described his relationship with Samaranch as "like that of
father and son, " said in the statement that the former diplomat left behind a
lasting legacy as a mediator between China and Taiwan as well as between South
Korea and North Korea.</P>
      <P>But Samaranch was not seen by all as a friend of Taiwan, especially in 1995 when
the southern city of Kaohsiung lost its bid to host the 2002 Asian Games to its
bitter rival -- South Korean port city Busan.</P>
      <P>At the time, local media reported that Samaranch interfered with the selection
process -- which was changed from a secret ballot vote to a show of hands --
that led some Kaohsiung supporters to withdraw their backing in the final vote.

    <TEXT>
      <P>Susan Brennan, president of the World Young Women's Christian Association (World
YWCA) was presented with a Lifetime Service award by the Taiwan YWCA Saturday
while commending the local branch for its work with underprivileged female
immigrants.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan to celebrate "World YWCA Day" with over 200 local YWCA members at a
breakfast meeting in Taipei, Brennan gave a talk on how women are creating a
safe world and shared examples of the work of YWCAs around the world to end
violence and bring peace, prosperity and security to society.</P>
      <P>"On this day, we rejoice in the leadership of women in creating safe spaces:
spaces which are free from violence and war, free from want and discrimination,
spaces in which women and girls realize their full potential," she said.</P>
      <P>Brennan also lauded the efforts of Taiwan's YWCA not only for helping female
immigrants but also for touching countless lives through special activities and
creating an opportunity for young women to participate in international affairs
and events.</P>
      <P>Brennan, in Taiwan for the second time, was elected president of the World YWCA
in Nairobi, Kenya in 2007. The 40-year-old Australian is the youngest women ever
and only the third woman from the Asia Pacific region to hold the office.</P>
      <P>In painting her vision of "a safe world, " she said it included the personal,
economic, political and environmental security of women and an unapologetic
emphasis on women as agents of change.</P>
      <P>"From the developing world, we have learned that a woman or girl reinvests 90
percent of her income in her family; a man reinvests 30-40 percent," Brennan
said.</P>
      <P>An extra year of primary school raises a girl's lifetime wages by 10-25 percent,
an extra year of secondary school raises a girl's lifetime wages by 15-25
percent, and the children of educated women are healthier and more likely to be
in school themselves, Brennan contended.</P>
      <P>The YWCA president acknowledged that considerable progress had been made
worldwide on women's human rights, but that more needed to be done.</P>
      <P>Many countries have passed laws to prevent violence, and women have obtained
greater levels of participation in political decision making, she said but
violence and cultural attitudes toward violence and women's participation in
education remained big problems.</P>
      <P>When asked specifically about the current environment for women in Taiwan,
Brennan told the Central News Agency that the current level of engagement with
the government by women's organizations is a really positive development.</P>
      <P>At the breakfast meeting, Brennan embraced a unique tradition practiced by the
Taiwan YWCA branch -- ringing small bells at the end of a meeting to highlight
their commitment and willingness to accept responsibility.</P>
      <P>"It is a beautiful sound, so I got a bell to take home with me, and I will bring
that custom with me and it will travel with me," she said.</P>
      <P>Brennan, who arrived Saturday morning, will be in Taipei until April 27.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan Solidarity Union officially filed a petition for a referendum  on the
proposed Taiwan-China  economic  cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) Friday,
two days before a debate is held on the issue between President Ma Ying-jeou and
opposition Democratic Progressive Party Chairperson Tsai Ing-wen.</P>
      <P>The widespread doubts and discontent in Taiwanese society toward the ECFA is
exactly what Ma and Tsai must address in the debate.</P>
      <P>Ma claimed that the agreement will be purely economic and that terminology
concerning sovereignty and unification will not appear in the agreement. This
aligns perfectly with China's obvious conspiracy to strip Taiwan of its
sovereignty and government under the pretense of "putting aside differences"
and "separating economics from politics."</P>
      <P>Also, the Ma administration has failed to clear up concerns that China may
continue to bar Taiwan's bids to sign free trade agreements with other countries
even after the signing of the ECFA. More ridiculous still, the ECFA has been
advertised in such a way that it appears  as if it will only bring Taiwan
benefits,  but not disadvantages.</P>
      <P>To this day, the vast majority of people still have no idea what the ECFA is all
about, and even government officials have no knowledge of its details.</P>
      <P>With the Ma administration continuing to lean toward China and the Legislative
Yuan failing to fulfill its oversight duty, the public has lost its confidence
in the government. Under these circumstances, the Taiwanese people have no other
choice but to push for a referendum to express their voice directly. (April 24,

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's Peking opera diva Wei Hai-ming loves to challenge herself by performing
new creative works, and this year she will hold a vocal recital for the first
time to showcase the extensive range of her talent.</P>
      <P>"I've loved to sing since I was a kid, but the key factor in making my dream
come true has been my training in recent years, which has made me believe that I
can do it, " she told the Central News Agency recently.</P>
      <P>The unprecedented concerts, to be held in Taichung, Taipei and Tainan on May 8,
16 and 29, respectively, will feature songs from the 1930s to the present,
including three episodes called Fantasia, Nostalgia and Aria Variata.</P>
      <P>Wei will share the stage with 12 musicians who either play Western musical
instruments or Eastern instruments.</P>
      <P>"I will present 20 songs that are adapted from different genres of Chinese
music. Some of them will include elements of Peking opera songs," Wei said.</P>
      <P>The Peking opera star will also go to Shanghai to perform her two favorite
operas -- "The Story of the Golden Cangue" and "The Kingdom of Desire" -- at the
World Expo in June, she said.</P>
      <P>"The Story of the Golden Cangue" is an adaptation of a modern novel, while "The
Kingdom of Desire" is a 1986 adaptation of Macbeth, with Wu Hsing-kuo, a
traditionally trained performer, playing Macbeth and Wei as Lady Macbeth."</P>
      <P>Wei is one of the most famous Chinese opera actresses of the Mei Lanfang school
in Taiwan and China. In 1996, she received the Plum Flower Award, the highest
honor for Peking opera actors.</P>
      <P>"I love tradition, but beyond just following that path, I have always wanted to
do more, " she said.</P>
      <P>Because of that drive, she has collaborated with Wu to create new forms of
theatrical expression such as "The Kingdom of Desire," which has received rave
reviews.</P>
      <P>She also cited the example of the play "Meng Xiaodong," presented earlier this
year for the first time, in which she sang as a woman, an old man or a young
man. Having trained for different roles in the past, she felt at that point in
time that it was "time to try something different."</P>
      <P>When Wei presented "The Kingdom of Desire" for the first time in China, some
critics compared it to dropping a bomb in China's drama milieu, since actors
there usually still strictly follow tradition.</P>
      <P>But now, more people appreciate innovative performances, and the actress remains
determined to constantly strive for improvement and give audiences something
new.</P>
      <P>"No matter how many times people see my performances, they can still see
something different, something new, because I always try to refresh the role and
reinterpret it," Wei said. By Sunnie Chen, CNA Staff Reporter</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The number of families receiving government assistance after meeting low-income
criteria rose 55.4 percent in 2009, according to statistics released by the
Ministry of the Interior (MOI) Saturday.</P>
      <P>The big jump resulted mainly from an amendment to the Statute for Providing Aid
to Families in Dire Straits in January 2009, which allows  assistance  to  be
granted  to  single-father  and skipped-generation families, the MOI said in a
statement.</P>
      <P>A total of 18,776 households were defined as families in dire straits around
Taiwan, with 1,202 led by men and the rest by women.</P>
      <P>Of the male-led families, 59 percent were led by single divorced men, while 48
percent of the female-led families were run by women who were forced to raise
children alone after their husband died, statistics showed.</P>
      <P>Over two-fifths (41.81 percent) of the heads of households receiving financial
assistance, or 7,850, were between the ages of 30 and 39, making it the age
bracket with the most aid recipients under the program in 2009.</P>
      <P>The second largest age group receiving aid were those in the 40-49 age bracket,
with 5,619 people applying for government help, followed by the 20-29 age group,
consisting of 3,957 people.</P>
      <P>Under the revised law, families in "dire straits" are defined as those in which
the average monthly income of each family member is less than 2.5 times the
government-designated minimum cost of living for the year, and which suffer from
extenuating circumstances, such as domestic violence or the absence of one of
the parents.</P>
      <P>Eligible households are entitled to various forms of aid, including emergency
living aid, living allowances for children aged under 18 years of age, and
subsidies for day care, education, health care, legal expenses, and business
start-up loans.</P>
      <P>The latest MOI statistics show that in 2009, the government distributed NT$491.3
million in different forms of aid to the families facing financial woes, 43
percent more than a year earlier.</P>

      <P>It is estimated that the government will lose at least NT$50 billion in tax

lower the corporate income tax rate to 17 percent and offer employment subsidies
to small- and medium-sized enterprises and tax credits for R&amp;D expenses.</P>
      <P>We have four suggestions for President Ma Ying-jeou to fix the country's
finances. First, Ma should state that he will not put forth further tax cut
plans in the remainder of his term and in his possible second term, nor will he
allow legislators from his Kuomintang to support any such plans.</P>
      <P>Second, in the first quarter of 2011, his administration should calculate
corporate income tax revenue for 2010 to see if the lower tax rate in fact
increase revenues, as some interest groups have claimed. In the event of a
decrease, the administration should seek to adjust the tax rate.</P>
      <P>Third, the Ma administration should set a ceiling on the share of tax revenue to
be distributed to Taipei City and four other special municipalities that will be
created at the end of the year.</P>
      <P>Fourth, Ma should request the Constitutional Court to issue an interpretation on
Article 91 of the Budget Act, which requires that legislators consult the
Executive Yuan and identify possible fiscal remedies when they initiate
legislation that would significantly decrease the government's revenue.</P>
      <P>To date, the article has not been observed, and Ma should ask the Constitutional
Court to give him the power to review or adjust laws that have violated it.

      <P>According  to city figures,  30 percent of low-to-mid-rise residential buildings
in Taipei City are more than 30 years old, and 80 percent (around 290,000

      <P>Based on an average of four people per household, 1.16 million people living in

      <P>The captain of a recreational fishing boat that sank after a collision with a

      <P>Ho Hung-yi, accompanied by Taipei County Magistrate Chou Hsi-wei and Legislator
Lee Ching-hua of the ruling Kuomintang, sailed out from a fishing harbor off
northern Taiwan to celebrate his new ship.</P>
      <P>On June 10, 2008, Ho's vessel, the Lienho, sank after it was rammed by a
Japanese vessel near the disputed Tiaoyutai islands, which are claimed by
Taiwan, China and Japan.</P>
      <P>The 13 recreational fishermen and three crew members on board were rescued as

      <P>Taipei County Magistrate Chou Hsi-wei helped make appeals to the Japanese

the captain for his vessel.</P>
      <P>Japan's  representative  office in Taiwan,  the Interchange Association, later

They also expressed willingness to compensate him for his losses.</P>
      <P>Ho was eventually  given NT$10.5 million  (US$333,330)  in compensation and then
borrowed about NT$8 million from his friends to buy the new boat.</P>
      <P>The 49-ton vessel is 23.7 meters long and 4.84 meters wide, considerably larger

      <P>The much anticipated televised debate on the economic cooperation framework

      <P>An opportunistic Lu Yen-hsun continued his hot run at the Status Athens Open
Saturday, defeating Gilles Muller of Luxembourg in straight sets to advance to
Sunday's final.</P>
      <P>Lu, currently ranked 102nd in the world, overcame a game challenge from the
lower-ranked Muller and a short rain delay early in the second set to book his
ticket to the final with a 6-4, 6-4 victory.</P>
      <P>He will face his occasional doubles partner, German Rainer Schuettler, in the
final of the 85,000 euro ATP Challenger event. Schuettler is seeded seventh and
has dropped two sets in his four wins leading to the final.</P>
      <P>Though the eighth-seeded Lu was rarely in trouble on his serve, losing a total
of only 13 points in 10 service games, he had trouble getting break
opportunities against the hard-serving Muller, who had 11 aces on the day.</P>
      <P>Lu had only six break points in the entire match, with four of them coming in
the first game of the second set -- all of which were saved by Muller.</P>
      <P>Fortunately for the 26-year-old Taiwanese, he converted the other two to earn a
service break in each set and the victory.</P>
      <P>Lu, whose ranking has dropped as he has played more top level ATP Tour events
over the past 10 months, is hoping to rack up ranking points on the second tier
Challenger tour during the main ATP Tour's claycourt season leading up to the
French Open in late May.</P>
      <P>Lu has never felt comfortable on clay and rarely plays on it, so he's hoping to
use the time to perform well enough in hardcourt Challenger events to propel him
back into the top 100.</P>
      <P>A victory in Athens would send him back into the top 90, where he would be
assured of gaining automatic entry to the main draw of grand slam events.</P>

      <P>Lu had only six break points in the entire match, with four of them coming in
the first game of the second set -- all of which were saved by Muller.</P>
      <P>Fortunately for the 26-year-old Taiwanese, he converted the other two to earn a
service break in each set and the victory.</P>
      <P>Lu, whose ranking has dropped as he has played more top level ATP Tour events
over the past 10 months, is hoping to rack up ranking points on the second tier
Challenger tour during the main ATP Tour's claycourt season leading up to the
French Open in late May.</P>
      <P>Lu has never felt comfortable on clay and rarely plays on it, so he's hoping to
use the time to perform well enough in hardcourt Challenger events to propel him
back into the top 100.</P>
      <P>A victory in Athens would send him back into the top 90, where he would be
assured of gaining automatic entry to the main draw of grand slam events.</P>

      <P>With three cases of dengue fever reported since March, a doctor warned that the
early start of indigenous infections may signal that the number of local cases
will increase this year.</P>
      <P>According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) under the Department of
Health, three dengue fever infections -- all indigenous -- have been found in
southern Taiwan's Kaohsiung City since the beginning of March, compared with
only one reported case during the same time last year.</P>
      <P>Huang Kao-pin, director of pediatric infectious disease at Chang Gung Medical
Foundation, Kaohsiung Branch, said that theoretically, indigenous infections
shouldn't begin to appear until July or August and peak in October or November.</P>
      <P>"It means that some mosquitoes even carried dengue virus during the winter,
which would result in an early start of the dengue fever outbreak," said Huang,
who is also the director-general of the Taiwan Society of Parasitology.</P>
      <P>Huang also said that there may be more people infected by dengue fever illness
this year, and that the possibilities of dengue hemorrhagic fever infection -- a
severe, potentially fatal infection that is different from normal dengue fever
-- will also become higher.</P>
      <P>Lin Ting, deputy director of the CDC, said that the number of dengue fever
infections will increase when the weather becomes hotter. Lin suggested the
public spend more effort cleaning living environments to prevent the outbreak of
the disease.</P>
      <P>Dengue fever is an influenza-like viral disease spread by the bite of infected
mosquitoes. Patients develop symptoms including fever, headache, nausea, fatigue
and pain in the muscles and joints.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A first-ever policy debate between a president and an opposition leader in
Taiwan's history will be held this afternoon. It is not only drawing wide
attention at home but also from foreign observers concerned about the Asia
Pacific region.</P>
      <P>Neither President  Ma Ying-jeou  nor opposition  Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen dares to overlook the debate on whether Taiwan
should sign a wide-reaching trade pact with China as it could influence their
leadership authority and political stature.</P>
      <P>While the Ma administration is preaching the need to strike an economic
cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) with China to protect Taiwan from being
marginalized amid mounting regional economic integration, the DPP-led opposition
camp strongly opposes the bid out of concern that Taiwan's sovereignty could be
at stake.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from local media coverage on the issue: China Times:</P>
      <P>Public Television Service (PTS) , the host of the high-profile event, conducted
a rehearsal for the debate Saturday. Aides from both sides showed up at the PTS
studio to finalize the procedures.</P>
      <P>Ma and Tsai were reportedly cautiously finalizing the lists of guests to be
invited to Sunday's televised debate, as the invitations would hint at their
positions on the ECFA deal.</P>
      <P>Ma's spokesman Lo Chih-chiang said the Presidential Office will invite a wide
range of representatives, such as farmers, laborers, white-collar workers and
scholars to attend, because the ECFA is a matter concerning the entire country.
Some Presidential Office staffers will also be present, but only Premier Wu Den-
yih will attend the event, with all other Cabinet members absent on the guest
list.</P>
      <P>DPP spokesman  Tsai Chi-chang  said the party will invite representatives  from
underprivileged  groups  and conventional industries that are most likely to be
affected by the trade pact. (April 25, 2010). United Daily News:</P>
      <P>In his weekly video address Saturday, Ma vowed to forge ahead the ECFA, saying
the administration will definitely sign the proposed trade accord because it is
conducive to Taiwan and its people.</P>
      <P>Presidential Office sources said Ma called off all other public activities for
the weekend in preparation for the debate and that he has been coached by his
team of advisers and aides, headed by Vice President Vincent Siew.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, DPP spokesman Tsai Chi-chang said Tsai Ing-wen was
maintaining her usual daily routine Saturday, except that she would go to bed
early to get plenty of sleep ahead of Sunday's debate.</P>
      <P>Given the emphasis both sides are putting on the event, political analysts said
the debate seems to be an opener for the 2012 presidential election. (April 25,
2010). Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>Ma will expound in detail in the debate the need for Taiwan to adopt an open-
door policy and the possible grave consequences if Taiwan continued a closed-
door policy implemented by the previous DPP administration.</P>
      <P>For her part, Tsai will articluate DPP's strategies for Taiwan to connect with
the world rather than putting Taiwan increasingly reliant on China.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Media an unseen casualty of game-fixing culture in local baseball</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>04/25/10  15:08:28</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Hundreds of thousands of baseball fans, dozens of honest players, and the game's
image have been seen as the main casualties of persistent game-fixing in
Taiwan's professional baseball league over the past 15 years.</P>
      <P>But they aren't the only ones. Local sportswriters have also been tormented by
the continuing scandal, which has led them to question their love for the
national pastime, the value of their work and careers in the media, and even
their trust and belief in others.</P>
      <P>"It is very difficult to accept the fact that those games you covered were
fixed, and those stories you wrote were kind of a joke," says Lan Tsung-piao, a
sportswriter who has been covering baseball since 1991, a year after the Chinese
Professional Baseball League (CPBL) , Taiwan's only professional baseball
organization,  was established.</P>
      <P>The game-fixing scandal last year was the sixth in a wave of scandals that has
undermined pro baseball in Taiwan since 1996. Similar incidents followed in
2003, 2005, 2007, 2008 and 2009.</P>
      <P>More than 100 Taiwanese and foreign players and coaches have been implicated in
those scandals for allegedly taking bribes from local bookies to throw games.</P>
      <P>Even big name players, such as former U.S. major leaguer Tsao Chin-hui, the
first Taiwanese pitcher to make it to the big leagues, have not been spared,
though Tsao was not indicted by prosecutors.</P>
      <P>The scandals have generally sent attendance plummeting, with the league never
regaining its popularity of the mid-1990s, when it drew more than 5,000 fans per
game. The average has lingered between 1,000 and 2,000 in recent years.</P>
      <P>According to Lan, media coverage has also been drastically cut back, and
reporters are no longer assigned to cover games outside of Taipei.</P>
      <P>Former baseball writer Kerry Wu, who decided to quit covering the game he loves
in 2000 and now works as a securities analyst, says there were about 30-40
reporters at each game when the league was at its peak in the 1990s.</P>
      <P>But as Lan says: "Now you're lucky if you can find more than four (reporters) in
the press room."</P>
      <P>The experienced baseball writer said he did not sense anything wrong until the
scandal broke out in 1997, when he was shocked to learn that some players who
were his close friends had been lying to him over the years.</P>
      <P>"I still love baseball. I really do, but I'm having trouble figuring out who --
including players and coaches -- to believe, " he says.</P>
      <P>Lan still vividly remembers the good times, making the repeated debacles even
more difficult to fathom.</P>
      <P>He recalls seeing a family of four, days before the 1996 scandal broke out,
happily talking about the game in the parking lot of a ballpark with the father
explaining baseball rules to his children.</P>
      <P>"It was such a lovely and inspiring scene. And that's why I never imagined how
deeply those players and scandals would hurt the feelings of these passionate
and supporting fans in every corner of the country, " he says.</P>
      <P>Wu also suffered through the duplicity, remembering a player who one morning
blasted the ethical standards and integrity of those who had been arrested, only
to be arrested himself in the afternoon.</P>
      <P>Some sportswriters were suspicious of the integrity of the game from the
beginning and published their observations, Lan says, but it was very difficult
to tell who was throwing games and who was not.</P>
      <P>"We could not pretend it was not happening. We had to depend on our instincts
but we had no evidence. Some writers, me included, received letters from law
firms threatening legal action. Some were even sued, " he laments.</P>
      <P>The scandals and declining interest in the game was difficult for these writers
to take, Lan's wife told the Central News Agency.</P>
      <P>"You're talking about a group of guys who covered the game, went home to watch
the replay, and played nothing but baseball video games together when they were
on road trips, " she says. "Most of them are baseball junkies who are hopelessly
passionate about the game to apathetic degree."</P>
      <P>A baseball  writer who helped  a guilty player write his autobiography before he
was implicated in game-fixing allegations, said she "felt cheated after the
scandal broke out."</P>
      <P>Wu says he turned his attention to the U.S. Major League baseball after quitting
his job as a reporter and has not been following the domestic league lately.
Others have decided to cover amateur competition.</P>
      <P>Lan, who still covers baseball to this day, says he thinks the league should
suspend operations for one or two years, change its name, and start fresh
because the fans have endured too many scandals.</P>
      <P>"Otherwise, every error, strikeout and fireworks in the outfield (a signal from
bookies) will always be suspicious."</P>
      <P>Kevin Hsiao, a younger reporter who has been covering the game for only a few
years, feels differently.</P>
      <P>"For younger reporters like me, we grew up with this league. It's hard to
imagine that this league would vanish for even one day, " he says, and Lan
acknowledges that Hsiao will probably get his way.</P>
      <P>"The show will go on. All we can do is cover the game as well and as responsibly
as we can. Hopefully there will be no more scandals. Just don't bet on it." By

    <HEADLINE>Economic Daily News: Learn from former lessons</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>04/25/10  15:14:42
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>While preparing to sign a trade pact with China that could have a profound and
far-reaching impact on Taiwan's economy and the people's welfare, we need to
remember the hard lessons the country has learned in the past, including tariff
concessions we made to gain admission to the World Trade Organization (WTO) and
the controversy over a pact on imports of U.S. beef.</P>
      <P>More than 10 years ago, when Taiwan was bidding to enter the GATT, which was
later superseded by the WTO, it promised to tax locally produced rice wine -- a
staple ingredient in Taiwanese cooking -- at a rate that was equal to taxes on
imported spirits such as Scotch whiskey.</P>
      <P>The tax commitment hurt the daily lives of ordinary Taiwanese people and
triggered smuggling and heavy protests, prompting the Legislature in recent
years to think about reclassifying rice wine as a cooking ingredient so that it
could be taxed at a lower rate.</P>
      <P>The administration believes, however, that any adjustment would be difficult to
defend because it would be seen as Taiwan reneging on the commitments it made to
gain WTO membership.</P>
      <P>Similar headaches occurred after Taiwan signed a pact with the United States
late last year agreeing to import U.S. bone-in beef, ground beef and some safe
bovine offal -- which triggered an outcry from critics who raised fears that the
cuts would bring mad cow disease to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Signing international agreements is no trivial matter and once they are signed,
it's hard to override them.</P>
      <P>We suggest that before signing any pact with any foreign country, the government
first research the issues carefully  and then communicate well with the people,
particularly those directly affected, on the issue.</P>
      <P>By doing so, the government could discover possible problems or pitfalls that
have been overlooked, and the public's opinions could be used as leverage by the
country's negotiators.</P>

    <DATELINE>04/25/10  15:16:52
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The public was shocked by an April 19 report that a mother took her own life and
the life of her 13-year-old daughter by burning charcoal indoors, despite the
fact the daughter had sought help after learning of her mother's plans.</P>
      <P>Social services and the police were criticized for lacking the skills and system
to prevent the tragedy.</P>
      <P>We admit that no social service institution is capable of saving everyone who is
determined to die. But it is unforgivable that the mother was able to take the
daughter with her. We hope that social workers and resources would be able to
help, and not just by breaking into the house when the mother began burning the
charcoal. We hope the social support system would have been able to let the
mother know death is not the only answer and that she had other options.</P>
      <P>It was reported that the mother -- identified only by the surname Tsao -- had
been tormented by the decision of the girl's father not to officially accept the
child as a member of his family. Suicide was her revenge.</P>
      <P>Sadly, we find most adults are selfish and often treat children like property,
arbitrarily deciding whether they live or die. Both Tsao and the father made the
wrong choices. While social workers are blamed for not being alert and causing
the girl's death, we shouldn't forget that her parents are also culprits. (April
25, 2010).</P>

      <P>Economics Minister Shih Yen-shiang said Sunday that recent movements in various
indicators showed that Taiwan's economy will be strong this year.</P>
      <P>Addressing the opening ceremony of a job fair in Taipei, Shih expressed

stronger.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan's economy should be strong this year, " Shih said, citing many economic
indicators to support his viewpoint.</P>
      <P>Shih said the International Monetary Fund (IMF) expected Taiwan's economy to
achieve growth of 6.5 percent in 2010, and the Council for Economic Planning and
Development (CEPD) also has forecast the economy to grow by at least 5 percent
this year.</P>
      <P>If those forecasts pan out, Taiwan's economic growth will outpace that of the

      <P>In addition, Shih said the value of export orders and industrial production both
set a new high in March, indicating that Taiwan's economy is growing at a fast

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou pledged Sunday to uphold Taiwan's interests at all costs
in negotiating an economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) with China, an
arrangement which  he  said  is  essential  to  reviving  Taiwan's  trade
competitiveness.</P>
      <P>"If the ECFA talks cannot secure Taiwan's overall economic benefits, I won't
accept it (the agreement) and would rather let it fall apart, " Ma said in his
opening statement when debating opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
Chairperson Tsai Ing-wen on the trade pact.</P>
      <P>According to Ma, the agreement will cover three main areas: tariff reductions
and exemption,  investment  protection,  and intellectual rights protection.</P>
      <P>There is a consensus between Taipei and Beijing that Taiwan will not open its
market to Chinese agricultural products and laborers, and that the two sides
will make the best of their efforts to protect conventional industries in
Taiwan, Ma said.</P>
      <P>For the small minority of conventional industries that are likely to be impacted
by the agreement, the government will set aside NT$95 billion over 10 years to
assist them, he said.</P>
      <P>After Taiwan's global trade ranking declined from 14th to 18th due to a closed-
door policy adopted by the DPP during its eight years in power, the ECFA will
boost Taiwan's exports and investment as well as employment, Ma argued.</P>
      <P>He said Taiwan must not allow itself to be isolated and marginalized  as the
regional economy is becoming increasingly integrated, noting that the number of
free trade agreements signed in Asia has increased from three in 2000 to 58 in
2009.</P>
      <P>In the next 10 years, he continued, a super-large free trade area comprising 17
nations and regions with total population of 3.3 billion is expected to be
established.</P>
      <P>"We cannot wait any longer. I want to lead Taiwan to recover those eight lost
years and open up 10 golden years ahead," he said.</P>
      <P>In her opening statement, however, Tsai said Ma's emphasis on the importance of
signing the ECFA with China has demonstrated the thinking that "Taiwan can only
gain access to the world via China." She challenged the president to tell the
public if this is Taiwan's "only choice" and if there is no other alternative
available.</P>
      <P>According to Tsai, the DPP insists that Taiwan should follow several principles
in developing economic and trade ties with China.</P>
      <P>These include that Taiwan must maintain its autonomy and that the relations
should be allowed to progress gradually, she said. Also, the ties must comply
with the World Trade Organization treaties, and Taiwan must maintain its trade
balance and avoid overly leaning toward China, Tsai said.</P>
      <P>She argued that signing the ECFA is not a mere economic issue, because Taiwan's
move will tilt the strategic balance in East Asia and even the whole of Asia.</P>
      <P>Also, Tsai expressed disappointment at Ma's failure to provide details of the
ECFA talks and dismay at government publicity that outlines only the benefits of
the ECFA, with no mention of its disadvantages.</P>
      <P>Once the agreement is signed, Taiwan will be subject to a 10-year time frame in
which it will be required to open its market fully, Tsai warned.</P>
      <P>"But the president has never told us how large the impact will be," she said.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou appealed to the nation Sunday to report the situation if
any official is found profiting from Taiwan's talks with China on signing an
economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA).</P>
      <P>"I attach great importance to the integrity of officials and the country's
ultimate interests in the long run," Ma said in response to a question from
opposition Democratic Progressive Party Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen,  who suggested
that some officials  of the Ma administration have probably begun to benefit
from the ECFA talks.</P>
      <P>Tsai  suggested  that  the  Ma administration  conduct  an investigation  into
possible  irregularities,  and Ma said his government welcomes reports of any
irregularities.</P>
      <P>He also stressed the importance and necessity of signing the ECFA with China,
the earlier the better.</P>
      <P>"I will have let down the voters and future generations if the signing of the
trade pact is delayed by my administration, " he asserted.</P>
      <P>Tsai accused Ma's pro-China policy of having drained Taiwanese resources and
deepened Taiwan's commercial and trade reliance on China.</P>
      <P>Ma argued, however, that his government has pursued Taiwan's opening to China in
a vigilant manner. He said that Taiwan's trade reliance on China stood at 23
percent in 2000, but the rate shot up to 40 percent in 2008 while the DPP was in
power.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan's trade reliance on China increased by a mere one percentage point to 41
percent by the end of 2009, after the year the Kuomintang has been in office,"
Ma said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, he said more Taiwanese enterprises who had relocated their investment
operations to China over the last decade, such as the Want Want Group and the
Tinghsin Group, have moved back to Taiwan to take advantage of the government's
liberalized cross-strait measures.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DOH to complete long-term care insurance proposal this year</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 25 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Department of Health (DOH) Minister Yaung Chih-liang said that the DOH is
scheduled to send a draft long-term care service bill to the Executive Yuan in
the second half of this year.</P>
      <P>It is hoped that the draft bill can be legislated into law in 2012 to address
the needs of Taiwan's graying society, Yaung said at a seminar sponsored by the
Taiwan Long-term Care Professional Association.</P>
      <P>Yaung said that the planning of long-term care will pose a great challenge that
"could prove even more difficult" than the current drive for a second-generation
health insurance  program  that calculates premiums based on total household
income, rather than the current system based on individual income.</P>
      <P>According to the long-term care insurance program envisioned by the Council for
Economic Planning and Development, there are two options: national insurance for
everyone or compulsory insurance for those over 40 years old, with the premium
for the former set at one-seventh of the health insurance premium and the latter
at two-sevenths of the health insurance premium.</P>
      <P>Day Guey-ing, deputy convener of a DOH panel working on the long- term care
program, said that private civic groups have asked the government to provide
long-term care through tax revenues as in some Scandinavian countries.</P>
      <P>She noted, however, that Taiwan's tax burden is only 13.4 percent, compared with
36 percent in Sweden and 48 percent in Denmark.</P>
      <P>The tax burden of a nation is usually evaluated by the ratio of total tax
revenue to GDP.</P>
      <P>For this reason, the premiums of the long-term care program should still follow
the payment pattern of the national health insurance program, she said.</P>
      <P>Day said that the public cares most about if there are sufficient long-term care
institutions and variations in the quality of service and prices charged.</P>
      <P>"But we have to first serve before talking about how to pay the bill," she said.</P>
      <P>She added that there is a growing number of mentally and physically challenged
people, as well as those who suffer from Alzheimer's disease. It is estimated
that by 2028, the number of such people will exceed 810,000.</P>
      <P>Moreover, due to the declining birth rate and the structural changes of
families, long-term care will no longer just be needed by a small number of
people, she added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ECFA urgently needed: President Ma</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou highlighted Sunday the urgent need for a planned trade
deal between Taiwan and China, stressing that as a responsible head of state, he
had to quickly clinch the agreement to protect the livelihoods and interests of
Taiwan's people.</P>
      <P>In one of the question-and-answer exchanges between Ma and Democratic
Progressive Party Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen in a debate on the proposed economic
cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) , Tsai challenged Ma's support for the
pact by saying it would deal a heavy blow to small businesses if it is rashly
inked in exchange for only limited benefit.</P>
      <P>Tsai also wondered why the government was aggressively pursuing a deal to lower
tariffs for goods exported to China when the machinery sector, for example,
already enjoyed an import duty of 1.95 percent under the WTO's most favored
nation treatment.</P>
      <P>Ma replied, however, that he knew one owner of a machinery company in Taichung
surnamed Lai who told him that goods exported by Taiwan-based machinery
exporters to China are actually subject to an 8 percent tariff rate.</P>
      <P>Noting that Lai's company is just one of over 200 small companies supplying
parts to a big machinery producer and exporter, Ma stressed that "large business
groups and small firms do not necessarily have contrary trade practices, " and
he argued the ECFA will help complete industrial clusters in a number of sectors
improve their profits.</P>
      <P>"What the government should do for local businesses, particularly these brave
and diligent small firms, is set a stage for them, and the ECFA is the right
stage at this point of time," he explained.</P>
      <P>To help Taiwan find a new lease on life and continue thriving amid fierce
competition from ASEAN, Japan and South Korea, the president emphasized he is
racing against time to achieve the goal. Otherwise, it will be too late after
eight years of inaction under the previous DPP administration.</P>
      <P>"The ECFA is urgent and necessary to Taiwan, and the government is poised to
consolidate every step it takes, " the president stressed.</P>
      <P>The Ma-Tsai debate was the first ever between the president and a major
opposition party leader in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The DPP strongly objects to the ECFA out of fear that it might open Taiwan's
doors to laborers and agricultural products from China, hurting the local
economy and threatening the livelihoods of the country's citizens, particularly
in southern Taiwan people.</P>
      <P>The DPP enjoys widespread support in Taiwan's southern regions, which heavily
relies in agriculture and conventional sectors.</P>

    <HEADLINE>United Daily News: Comments on speedy trial act</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>04/25/10  17:36:35
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A bill aimed at expediting the trial of criminal cases was passed by the
Legislative Yuan last Friday. The Judiciary Yuan should also push for the
revamping of the Code of Criminal Procedure to ensure the quick and appropriate
trial of criminal cases.</P>
      <P>The bill entitles a defendant who has stood on trial for more than eight years
to ask for a commutation of any sentence under certain conditions, limits the
prosecutor's power to appeal, and prohibits the detention of the defendant
before a case is adjudicated for more than eight years.</P>
      <P>The bill has its problematic areas. For example, defendants who were charged
with the same offense may be treated differently because of the differing
lengths of time their cases have been in the court system.</P>
      <P>Also the bill will open avenues for prosecutors and judges to help defendants by
dragging their feet in trials.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the bill has usurped the role of the Code of Criminal Procedure by
setting limitations on the detention of the defendant and the prosecutors' power
to appeal, thus confusing criminal procedures.</P>
      <P>The root cause of criminal trials becoming cumbersome is that the Supreme Court
repeatedly remands cases to lower courts for retrials.</P>
      <P>The remedy is to make sure that the evidence in a case is fully disclosed and
clearly determined in the first trial and does not need to be investigated again
in ensuing trials. The Supreme Count should be limited to examining whether the
law applied in the case is appropriate.</P>
      <P>There is no reason to stipulate the period of detention in the Code of Criminal
Procedure for defendants charged with misdemeanors and in the bill on a speedy
trial for those charged with felonies.</P>
      <P>Stipulating the periods of detention in different laws will complicate the task
of streamlining criminal procedures.</P>
      <P>The bill prohibits prosecutors from filing appeals in cases where the defendant
was found not guilty in both the first and second trials. However, Ministry of
Justice statistics show that verdicts in 60 percent of such cases were thrown
out by the Supreme Court on appeal by prosecutors.</P>
      <P>The bill also failed to take into consideration how the victims in criminal
cases would feel if no one were found responsible for their suffering.</P>
      <P>The bill is more a way to silence public criticism than to fix the problem of
procrastination in criminal trials. (April 25, 2010)</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou urged the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
Sunday not to boycott discussion in the Legislative Yuan on the pros and cons of
a proposed wide-reaching trade pact with China.</P>
      <P>In a televised debate with DPP Chairperson Tsai Ing-wen, Ma expressed regret
over what he called the opposition party's repeated obstructions of reports by
government officials on the initiative to sign an economic cooperation framework
agreement (ECFA) with China.</P>
      <P>Stressing the importance of such a deal to Taiwan's future economic development,
Ma said officials of his administration have been more than willing to brief DPP
lawmakers on the ECFA's essence and draft content.</P>
      <P>DPP lawmakers, however, had repeatedly boycotted such sessions in the
legislature, he said.</P>
      <P>In a mature democratic country, Ma said, the legislature should be a key venue
for policy debate. Instead of blaming the government for keeping the opposition
party in the dark on the pact, Ma urged Tsai to order DPP lawmakers not to
hinder legislative hearings on ECFA issues anymore.</P>
      <P>Ma, however, failed to respond to Tsai's question on whether his administration
has any alternative plan if ECFA talks with China break down.</P>
      <P>Accusing the Ma administration of creating a false sense of urgency in
concluding such a critical agreement with China, Tsai said that China may have
ulterior  motives  for making  unilateral concessions to Taiwan in ECFA talks.</P>
      <P>She also advised the Ma administration to prepare a detailed package of measures

    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen said in a
debate Sunday that the public's sense of insecurity over a proposed trade pact
with China was not "something the DPP could create," after her party was accused
of being only good at scaring the people over the deal.</P>
      <P>In a highly anticipated debate on the economic cooperation framework agreement
(ECFA) Sunday, President Ma Ying-jeou charged that the DPP was behind much of
the negative impression people had of the controversial pact.</P>
      <P>Citing a DPP estimate on the number of white-collar workers who would be
adversely affected by the ECFA that went from 3.21 million on April 6 to 5.9
million five days later, Ma asked if Tsai wanted to use public sense of
insecurity to intimidate people for political ends and election gains.</P>
      <P>Moreover, as noted experts such as Michael Porter and Paul Krugman and foreign
investors think that the merits of signing the ECFA are bigger than the
disadvantages, Ma asked why the DPP has often had more pessimistic views.</P>
      <P>"The DPP has always talked about going global, but why has it deliberately left
out China?" Ma asked.</P>
      <P>In response, Tsai said the public's insecurity does in fact exist and was not
something that a party could create.</P>
      <P>The DPP is a poor party  and does  not have  the ample administrative resources
of the KMT, so that it can only reflect and voice the deepest anxieties of the
people.</P>
      <P>"Not only the green camp led by the DPP, but between 40 and 50 percent of those
in the pro-blue camp led by the KMT have had a sense of anxiety about Taiwan's
future in public opinion polls conducted by the DPP," she said.</P>
      <P>In fact, since President Ma assumed his office, he has never stood up for
Taiwan's sovereignty, Tsai said.</P>
      <P>Moreover, in negotiations with China and the United States, the Ma
administration has never strongly defended its position, leaving the public
feeling it does not have a "president they can trust, " Tsai said.</P>
      <P>She said the public has not seen the ECFA's early harvest list, and the biggest
issue is that the administration has never honestly addressed the issue, either
by explaining the possible downside of the trade pact or releasing its internal
assessments  on the agreement.</P>
      <P>Tsai said the DPP was by no means trying to intimidate the people by trying to
inflate the number of white-collar workers impacted by the ECFA, saying that the
party had to adjust the number because it had to include those whose salary will
not increase.</P>
      <P>Although Ma noted that scholars and foreign investors support the inking of the
ECFA, Tsai said that as a president, Ma should consider himself as somebody of a
different status and responsibility, not an economics master.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President  Ma Ying-jeou expressed confidence that Taiwanese people have the
ability to deal with any adverse impact from a proposed trade pact with China
and said the government will take the bold move of signing to secure a better
future for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In a live,  televised  debate  with opposition  Democratic Progressive Party
Chairperson (DPP) Tsai Ing-wen on the economic cooperation framework agreement
(ECFA) ,  Ma stressed that the government planned to take measures to help 17
weaker industries that could be affected adversely by the pact.</P>
      <P>He said measures to be taken include helping those industries to revive or
adjust their business nature, and offering subsidies of about NT$95 billion
(US$3 billion) , of which about NT$36.5 billion will be used by the Council of
Labor Affairs.</P>
      <P>In early April, the Industrial Development Bureau added five industries --
Chinese medicines, pesticides, environmental agents, animal drugs and bamboo and
wooden products -- to the list of industries to be eligible to receive
subsidies. The previously planned 12 industries include garments, home
appliances and stone materials.</P>
      <P>"It will not be the first time Taiwan faced such a crisis. Taiwan survived a
greater impact after joining the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2002, " said
Ma, adding that he believes Taiwan has the ability to get over the crisis this
time as well.</P>
      <P>Tsai argued that Taiwanese  businessmen,  attracted by the elimination of
tariffs as proposed under the pact, would invest in China and use the lack of
tariffs to sell their products back to Taiwan cheaply, which could force even
more Taiwanese companies to move to China.</P>
      <P>Ma said the government would take measures to enhance the checking of
certificates of origin to prevent illegal imports of Chinese products from
damaging local manufacturers.</P>
      <P>The "no-hurry" attitude on Taiwan-China trade relations that the DPP took during
its eight years in power hurt Taiwan's economy, Ma said, adding that as
president he needs to have a vision and consider what may happen in five or 10
years.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou stressed Sunday that Taiwan needed to quickly sign a
trade pact with China to prevent Taiwan from being marginalized further at a
time when regional trade blocs are forming at an increasing pace.</P>
      <P>ASEAN plus One (China) took effect in January this year and that ASEAN plus
Three and other trade blocs are already on drawing boards, Ma said in a debate
with opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen on
the economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA).</P>
      <P>South Korea has signed free trade agreements (FTAs) with seven major trade
partners, China has signed FTAs with nine major players in international trade
and Singapore has signed FTAs with 14 major economies, but Taiwan has signed
none in Asia, the president said.</P>
      <P>"While other countries strived to tie trade knots, we are arguing among
ourselves and losing time, " he argued.</P>
      <P>Tsai disagreed, saying that signing an ECFA is not a pressing issue, arguing
that ASEAN plus China has only cost Taiwan 0.035 percent of GDP, and the signing
of ASEAN plus Three is a long way away.</P>
      <P>She told Ma that signing an ECFA with China is not an issue that can be dealt
with "romantically," arguing that China's desire to sign the ECFA with Taiwan or
FTAs with other countries was based on strategic considerations, rather than
pure economic purposes.</P>
      <P>Citing Indonesia as an example, Tsai said Southeast Asian countries have begun
to feel the heat after the ASEAN plus China trade zone came into being.</P>
      <P>"Indonesia has asked for a delay in the implementation of the regional trade
pact," she said.</P>
      <P>Tsai warned that Taiwan's signing of the ECFA with China, reportedly in June,
may result in the change of the strategic map of East Asia and further increase
China's clout in the region.</P>
      <P>Tsai said the ECFA is not a must for Taiwan, pointing out that Taiwan should
seek to strengthen trade ties with other countries under the World Trade
Organization (WTO) framework, such as the Trade and Investment Framework
Agreement (TIFA) signed with the United States for example.</P>
      <P>Ma responded that strengthening trade engagement with other countries beyond
China is of course an option of his administration, but Taiwan has encountered
difficulties doing so when those countries became reluctant to sign any
agreement with Taiwan because "Taiwan maintains no connections with China."</P>
      <P>Tsai accused the Ma administration of rushing to sign the pact without having
not fully informed Taiwan's people about its contents, saying that three-fourths
of the people were not familiar with the trade pact or an "early harvest" list
covering products to receive immediate tariff concessions.</P>
      <P>Concerned that terms of the agreement would not be reviewed by the Legislature
before the deal was completed and signed, Tsai asked Ma what would happen if the
ECFA was rejected by the Legislature. "Will you redo it all over again?"</P>
      <P>Ma ignored the question but reasserted his administration's rationale for the
pact.</P>
      <P>"Our strategy is to not let Taiwan be left behind, " he said. "We would be
unable to meet the challenges ahead or cope with the international situation if
we do not sign the ECFA."</P>
      <P>Contending that his government has consulted economic experts, scholars and the
private sector and is well prepared for the signing of the ECFA, Ma asked Tsai
what the DPP's plans were to meet future challenges, other than waiting,
spreading fear and even intimidating the government and the people over the
issue.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen on Sunday
rejected the government's argument that a trade pact with China is needed to
counter the impact of the "ASEAN plus One" free trade zone, saying Southeast
Asian countries are not Taiwan's main competitors in China.</P>
      <P>In a debate on a proposed economic cooperation  framework agreement (ECFA)
between Taiwan and China, President Ma Ying-jeou said the new free trade zone,
which took effect Jan. 1, has directly affected Taiwan's automobile, machinery,
petrochemical and textile sectors.</P>
      <P>Those sectors are now faced with higher tariffs than their ASEAN competitors in
the Chinese market, Ma said, and added that the DPP think tank's suggestion to
let industrial sectors facing high tariffs move to China rather than signing the
ECFA would leave some 590,000 workers in Taiwan jobless.</P>
      <P>In response, Tsai said that Japan and South Korea, and not ASEAN (Association of
Southeast Asian Nations) countries, were Taiwan's main rivals in those sectors
in China.</P>
      <P>She accused the president of exaggerating and overstating the impact of the
"ASEAN plus One" zone, and said that in a mature industrial sector, quality,
innovation and value-added determined profitability more than tariffs on trade.</P>
      <P>Also, once the value of the Chinese yuan rises, triggering the likely rise in
the appreciation of Taiwan's currency, any gains from the tariff reductions will
be offset, Tsai argued.</P>
      <P>She also challenged Ma's belief that Taiwan will be further marginalized once
Japan and South Korea join "ASEAN plus One" and make it "ASEAN plus Three,"
reportedly in 2012.</P>
      <P>"ASEAN plus Three will not be formed within the foreseeable future, " she
predicted, because of reluctance on the part of Japan and South Korea.</P>
      <P>The two countries not only fear that their domestic industries cannot  withstand
competitors  from  China,  but also that a "China-centric East Asian economic
circle" will be formed, which they believe will change the strategic balance in
the region, Tsai said.</P>

      <P>Opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen said
Sunday that President Ma Ying-jeou failed to give convincing responses to her
questions about the impact of a proposed cross-Taiwan Strait trade pact on local
industries.</P>
      <P>Tsai also complained about Ma's criticism of the DPP in a 150-minute debate on
an economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) currently being negotiated
with China, saying he contradicted himself on the DPP's handling of cross-strait
relations during its eight years in power from 2000-2008.</P>
      <P>"On the one hand, Ma completely denied the DPP's efforts to promote cross-strait
exchanges during its eight years in power, but he also recognized the DPP's
contribution to promote cross-strait tourism and economic exchanges, " Tsai said
at a post-debate news conference.</P>
      <P>"His statements were contradictory."</P>
      <P>In the debate, Ma repeatedly asked the public to trust him and have confidence
in his guarantee of the trade pact's benefits, but he failed to allay public
worries whether his assurance would be valid or not, Tsai said.</P>
      <P>She also expressed regret that Ma failed to give convincing responses to many
substantive issues she questioned him about in the televised debate.</P>
      <P>They included contingency plans the government had if the ECFA talks with China
broke down, the exact amount of tariff benefits Taiwan could reap under the ECFA
deal, and measures to deal with the increasing gap between rich and poor caused
by the deal.</P>
      <P>"His failure in this regard further confirms our belief that the ECFA initiative
was a hasty decision proposed by a few people, " Tsai argued at the news
conference.</P>
      <P>While Ma took advantage of the debate to advertise what he called the ECFA's
advantages and make false accusations against the DPP, Tsai said Ma's
performance highlighted the ruling Kuomintang's inability to examine itself and
its treatment of dealings with the opposition party as political warfare.</P>
      <P>In the debate, Ma attacked the DPP for what he called the party's "closed-door"
policy toward China, characterizing the period as the "lost eight years" because
it hindered progress in cross-strait ties and  exacerbated  Taiwan's  diplomatic
isolation  and economic marginalization.</P>
      <P>Tsai said Ma's accusation was unfair and reflected his lack of introspection.</P>
      <P>Instead  of  discounting  the  DPP's  criticism  of  his administration's ECFA
initiative, Ma and his administrative team should take into account the DPP's
proposals in policy formulation.</P>
      <P>While the DPP supports the strategy of using the Chinese market to beef up
Taiwan's economic strength, Tsai the DPP calls for developing relations with
China in a gradual manner.</P>
      <P>Tsai further said ECFA not only involves economic issues but will also affect
the balance of power in entire Asia, warning that Taiwan's speedy economic
integration with China may tilt strategic balance of power in Asia.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Pact with China to benefit both sides: president</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The proposed economic cooperation framework agreement with China will benefit
both sides, President Ma Ying-jeou said in an indirect denial of Beijing's
claims that it will concede benefits to Taiwan through the pact.</P>
      <P>In his televised debate with Democratic Progressive  Party Chairperson Tsai Ing-
wen over whether the country should sign such a pact with China, Ma said
Taiwanese have invested more than NT$200 billion (US$6.34 billion) in China,
adding that Taiwan enjoyed a cross-strait trade surplus of more than NT$400
billion a year.</P>
      <P>Much of these exports are materials shipped to China and processed there before
being exported to foreign markets, a system that benefits both Taiwan and China,
the president said.</P>
      <P>As to the problem of redistributing wealth and reorganizing local industries
after the pact is signed, Ma said this would be done through the social welfare
system and taxation.</P>
      <P>The president said that there are 17 kinds of local industries that will be
negatively influenced by the pact, and that the government  will help them ride
out the crisis  by upgrading themselves.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan succeeded in cushioning the impact brought about by its
admission to the World Trade Organization in 2002, Ma said this experience gave
the country confidence to cope with any fallout triggered by the proposed trade
pact with China.</P>

      <P>Taiwan and China are likely to complete an "early harvest list" in the fourth
round of bilateral talks on a cross-Taiwan Strait economic cooperation framework
agreement (ECFA) , Minister of Economic Affairs Shih Yen-shiang said Sunday.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan and China will be able to fix the major items to be included on the list
in their third-round talks, which may take place in late April or early May,"
Shih told reporters.</P>
      <P>"Therefore, the two sides are expected to settle the 'early harvest list' in the
fourth talks, and it could be published if both sides agree to do so," he added.</P>
      <P>The "early harvest list " refers to a list of items that will enjoy an immediate
reduction or elimination of tariffs after the ECFA is signed. The priority tax
cut list is the centerpiece of the agreement,  which the government  says will
help Taiwan avoid marginalization amid increasingly integrated trade in the
region.</P>
      <P>According to Shih, the machinery, textile, petrochemical and transportation
industries,  as well  as a few categories  of information-related products, will
be included on the "early harvest list" to be put forth by his ministry.</P>
      <P>"One thing is for sure, Taiwan's 'early harvest list' will be more comprehensive
than China's, " he added. This means that the number of items and their total
export value will certainly be higher than China's due to the difference in the
size of the two markets, he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Transition from ECFA to FTA will be gradual: Ma</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Sunday that the cross-strait proposed economic
cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) is not a fully developed free trade pact
but a start toward it, and that the country will have time to adapt during the
transition.</P>
      <P>The transition between the ECFA and a full-fledged free trade pact would be
gradual and that Taiwan's people were up to the challenge, he added.</P>
      <P>In a televised debate with Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairperson Tsai
Ing-wen over whether the country should sign an ECFA with China, Ma said that
the DPP government opened the local market to 936 Chinese agricultural goods
during its eight years in power, while his administration has approved none.</P>
      <P>Still, Ma said, the DPP often accuses him of planning to allow more Chinese
agricultural products to enter Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In her response, Tsai said that the DPP approved the entry of Chinese produce to
bring the country in line with the rules of the World Trade Organization (WTO).</P>
      <P>Tsai, a former vice premier under the administration of former President Chen
Shui-bian, said the ECFA is a step toward a free trade pact under the WTO
framework, which she said required signatories to fully open their markets to
each other's produce within 10 years, and Taiwan would be no exception.</P>
      <P>"If the plan is to obtain China's  consent to waive the requirement for Taiwan,
why would China do this and how would other states allow it?" she asked.</P>
      <P>Not all free trade pact signatories have to fully open their produce markets
within 10 years, Ma said, adding that 23 out of the 272 free trade pacts under
the WTO provided for 10 to 24 years for the opening to 50 percent to 90 percent
of the counterpart's produce.</P>
      <P>Tsai said Taiwan won't be allowed to follow the examples of these 23 pacts in
light of its strong trading power, and is sure to be asked to open its market to
90 percent  or more of Chinese agricultural products during negotiations with
China.</P>
      <P>She criticized  the government  for not making public the industries that will
enjoy an early exemption of tariffs, which she said has caused a panic among
businesses, adding that more than three-fourths of Taiwan's people don't
understand what the ECFA is about.</P>
      <P>Ma said his administration has been going out its way to explain the pact to the
general public.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ECFA crucial to petrochemical sector: industry association</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Signing  a cross-strait  economic cooperation  framework  agreement  (ECFA)  is
crucial  to the petrochemical sector because it would make Taiwan's products
more competitive, a local petrochemical association said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The Petrochemical Industry Association of Taiwan said 70 percent of the
petrochemical products produced in Taiwan are currently exported to China to
meet demand that is not satisfied by the mainland's own production.</P>
      <P>China has to rely on imports for 30 percent of its needs, of which 20 percent
come from Taiwan, the association said, just hours after President Ma Ying-jeou
and Democratic Progressive  Party Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen held a marathon debate
on the merits of the proposed trade pact.</P>
      <P>The ECFA, currently being negotiated, is strongly opposed by Tsai and her party
because they fear it will undermine Taiwan's economy and because the potential
benefits are not as ample as the government has suggested.</P>
      <P>According to one association official, members of the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations (ASEAN) receive duty-free treatment when shipping their
petrochemical products to China, but Taiwan's products face tariffs of 6.5
percent, making them less competitive against those offered by ASEAN rivals.</P>
      <P>The official  noted that among  the sectors  to be given preferential tariff
treatment under the ECFA's "early harvest list" -- machinery, mid- and upstream
textiles, transportation vehicles and petrochemicals -- only the petrochemical
sector involves one-way trade, from Taiwan to China, while the others involve
two-way trade.</P>
      <P>Based on these considerations, the official said the inking of the ECFA is
crucial to the petrochemical industry.</P>
      <P>The Formosa Plastics Group (FPG), the dominant private player in Taiwan's
petrochemical sector, said signing the pact will help its products make further
inroads into China's vast market.</P>
      <P>The company said that Taiwan's petrochemical products are highly competitive,
and that if Taiwan can sign free trade agreements with other countries after
signing the ECFA, it will be able to strengthen its Taiwan base and export to
the whole world.</P>

      <P>An isolated living coral reef was found in a Dongsha atoll lagoon area that
contains mostly dead coral, showing the atoll will likely return to its original
appearance, park administration said Sunday.</P>
      <P>According to the National Park Administration under the Ministry of Internal
Affairs' Construction and Planning Agency, the huge reef -- about 8 kilometers
east of Dongsha Island -- has a diameter of over 100 meters, and its lifeless
top looks like many other dead reefs in the area.</P>
      <P>After noticing a group of fishes appearing near the reef flat, however, a group
of researchers decided to dive into the water and found a lot more fish and
invertebrates inhabiting the reef slope, where massive live corals -- such as
porite or "finger" coral, acropora or "table" coral, and brain coral were also
found.</P>
      <P>The discovery of the massive live corals was encouraging, because corals in the
Dongsha atoll have been recovering slower than those on the outside of the atoll
since the destruction of coral from the effects of El Nino in 1998, the
administration said.</P>
      <P>The administration said it will spend more effort investigating and researching
the atoll lagoon's ecology and seek effective ways to restore it.</P>
      <P>Park administration increased its underwater investigation after it bought a
research boat last year and started to explore the Dongsha atoll lagoon area
this year, it added.</P>
      <P>The Dongsha atoll, located about 444 kilometers southwest of Kaohsiung, was
designated by the government as the country's first marine national park in

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Sunday that that the process of negotiating the
"early harvest list" under a proposed economic cooperation framework agreement
(ECFA) with China, should be transparent, but that its content should not be.</P>
      <P>In a debate on a proposed cross-strait trade pact, the president said he agreed
with his rival, Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen, that
the negotiations in principle should be transparent.</P>
      <P>"But what is currently under negotiation cannot be revealed at the moment, " he
said.</P>
      <P>Ma promised that his administration will make public the content of the "early
harvest list" before submitting it to the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Admitting that the government needs to do more to help the public understand the
proposed trade pact with China and the urgency of signing such a deal, Ma said
some non-high-tech sectors anticipate that they might be left at a disadvantage
by the deal.</P>
      <P>"The Ministry of Economic Affairs has listed 17 categories of disadvantaged
industries and is making contact with companies in these sectors, trying to help
them reduce the impact from such an agreement," the president said.</P>
      <P>Tsai rejected Ma's argument  that accepting  the potential consequences of the
ECFA was a challenge that Taiwan needed to accept in order to maintain the
competitiveness of local industries before the formation of the ASEAN
(Association of Southeast Asian Nations) plus Three (China, Japan and South
Korea) trade bloc.</P>
      <P>She suggested that such a bloc was still a long way away because both Japan and
South Korea have strategic concerns to consider before entering into a trade
pact with China.</P>
      <P>The two countries are worried about the impact of free trade agreements with
China on their domestic industries, and also fear the emergence of a China-
centric East Asia economic zone, according to Tsai.</P>
      <P>She also argued that Taiwan might pay a huge price in the long run for accepting
minor tariff concessions from China.</P>
      <P>Although the items listed in the "early harvest list" might be limited, Taiwan's
partial lifting of import restrictions on Chinese products would eventually lead
to the wide opening of the local market and hurt companies that rely primarily
on domestic sales, she said.</P>

      <P>The Taiwan Hosiery Manufacturers' Association (THMA) said Sunday that it
welcomed the government's efforts to sign an economic cooperation framework
agreement (ECFA) with China.</P>
      <P>THMA Chairman Wei Ping-chi said socks, tights and stockings made in Taiwan are
of much higher quality than those produced in China and once an the cross-strait
trade pact is forged, made-in-Taiwan hosiery products will enjoy a fast-growing
market in China.</P>
      <P>"The opening of the market brought about by the ECFA will create a new business
niche in China for Taiwanese hosiery manufacturers, " Wei forecast.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks in response to a televised debate between President Ma Ying-
jeou and opposition Democratic Progressive Party Chairperson Tsai Ing-wen on
signing an ECFA.</P>
      <P>Tsai said during the debate that Taiwanese manufacturers may benefit from ECFA-
authorized tariff concessions temporarily, but that the international
competitiveness of Taiwan's industrial sector would be compromised in the long
run.</P>
      <P>Wei is president of Fu Chu Knitting Co., producer of high-quality legwear under
several brand names. Eighty percent of the company's products are exported to
the United States and the remaining 20 percent are mainly exported to Europe,
Asia and Latin America.</P>
      <P>He predicted that after the ECFA is signed, the government will be obliged to
strengthen inspection and control on imports from China and in turn stymie the
smuggling of substandard hosiery products from China.</P>
      <P>"The ECFA will allow Taiwan manufacturers an opportunity to compete with their
Chinese rivals on a fair and legal platform, creating a niche for us," Wei said.</P>
      <P>He said that from this year on, he plans for his company's business in China to
increase by at least 20 percent per year.Fu Chu has also been working to set up
some 200 retailing stores in major Chinese cities, he added.</P>
      <P>Wei said that opposing an ECFA is tantamount to protecting dishonest players,
suggesting that some Taiwanese traders have imported inexpensive hosiery from
China via a third place and relabeled the smuggled goods so they appeared to be
from Vietnam, Japan or South Korea.</P>
      <P>He said that despite a high 17 percent import tariff, Chinese hosiery importers
have increasingly placed orders with his company and other Taiwanese makers
because they were impressed by the Taiwan products' high quality and designs.</P>
      <P>"They (Chinese importers) paid before delivery was made, " Wei said.</P>
      <P>He painted a rosy picture for his company and other Taiwanese hosiery
manufacturers after Taiwan signs the ECFA with China, saying that a market of
over one billion hosiery users is indeed a big draw for Taiwan makers.</P>
      <P>"It would be too late for us to catch up once the ASEAN Plus Three (China, Japan
and South Korea) is struck," Wei asserted.</P>

      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party will continue to push for a
referendum on the proposed economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) with
China, the party's chairwoman, Tsai Ing-wen, said Sunday.</P>
      <P>"Our position on the referendum is very clear. We will press on toward the goal
together with our ally, the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) , " Tsai said in a
news conference held immediately after her debate on the trade pact with
President Ma Ying-jeou.</P>
      <P>As a responsible leader, Ma should help facilitate the referendum and even have
legislators from his Kuomintang cooperate with the DPP in promoting the vote,
Tsai said.</P>
      <P>She also said she could not remember  Ma "answering  any substantive questions"
throughout the entire debate. However, she said, the DPP will welcome any chance
for further debate on the issue.</P>
      <P>On whether  to go ahead  with a plan to hold a massive demonstration against the
ECFA, Tsai said her party will watch if Ma will adjust its attitude and drop the
thinking that the agreement "must be signed no matter what" in June.</P>
      <P>In the debate, the opposition leader described the ECFA policy as an ill-advised
one that is based on a miscalculation of Taiwan's international situation.</P>
      <P>She warned that Taiwan's premature economic integration with China could tilt
the strategic balance in East Asia and even the whole of Asia.</P>
      <P>The agreement will also force Taiwan to fully open its market to China in the
next 10 years, leaving many Taiwan people out of work, according to Tsai.</P>
      <P>In a separate news conference, Ma said he looks forward to holding further
discussions with Tsai on the issue and that he will see if there are other
things his administration can do to clear up the doubts held by the public.</P>
      <P>Ma said the public should not see the signing of the ECFA as Taiwan taking a
risk.</P>
      <P>"If the agreement is signed, Taiwan's economic and trade status in East Asia
will be very different," the president said.</P>
      <P>On the referendum issue,  Ma reiterated that initiating a referendum is part of
the people's rights and that the government will not interfere as long as such
an initiative is consistent with the law.</P>
      <P>However, the government will not launch a referendum on the ECFA, because under
the Referendum Act, the government is forbidden from doing so unless there is a
situation threatening national security.</P>
      <P>On Thursday, the TSU filed a new petition with the Central Election Commission
for a referendum on the ECFA, eight months after a previous petition filed by
the DPP was rejected.</P>
      <P>The CEC will meet May 4 to determine if the new proposal meets legal
requirements.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou unveiled on Sunday a plan to assemble a task force that
he will lead to facilitate Taiwan's efforts to negotiate free trade agreements
with its major trade partners.</P>
      <P>In his closing remarks in a debate with the opposition Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) Chairperson Tsai Ing-wen on the merits of a proposed economic
cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) with China, Ma broached the plan as he
defended the pact, which he said would help counter the formation of regional
trade blocs.</P>
      <P>Japan, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations countries have
forged or are seeking to form trade partnership relations with China to achieve
mutual economic and trade benefits and enhance their competitiveness, Ma said.</P>
      <P>But Taiwan did not make any progress in improving its economic status under the
rule of the previous DPP government due to the closed mind-set of the party, he
said.</P>
      <P>"Others have already run four or five laps while we're still tying our
shoelaces. How much longer can we wait? Do we want to win or not?" he said.</P>
      <P>Key to the effort, Ma said, is signing the ECFA, which will give new life to
Taiwan's economy and create jobs, and then making renewed efforts to sign free
trade agreements (FTAs) with other major trading partners.</P>
      <P>To expedite the process, Ma said he will lead the FTA task force on signing FTAs
with other countries, and urged China not to block Taiwan's pursuit of free
trade deals with them.</P>
      <P>In her closing remarks, Tsai summarized the "unprecedented negative impact" the
proposed ECFA would have on some local sectors, particularly low-end industries.</P>
      <P>Questioning Ma's assurances that the government would safeguard the country's
interests, Tsai asked how people could trust him after he has been unable to
fulfill his campaign promise to raise economic growth to 6 percent, reduce
unemployment to 3 percent, and raise per capita income to US$30,000.</P>
      <P>Rather than the government providing assurances, Tsai urged Ma to come up with
concrete  measures  to particularly  protect the disadvantaged, farmers and wage
earners who are expected to be affected the most by the ECFA.</P>
      <P>She also panned the government's focus on ECFA, saying there were many difficult
issues facing the country, such as an aging society, a weak job market, an
imbalance between urban and rural development and natural disaster prevention
that also required attention.</P>
      <P>The country's  economic  policy should also encompass  the adjustment of
Taiwan's economic structure, industrial development and financial policy, Tsai
added.</P>
      <P>Signing the ECFA, she said, is not only the option, suggesting that Taiwan can
also seek to forge closer economic and trade relations with other countries
under the frameworks of the World Trade Organization and the Asia Pacific

      <P>Two officials of farmers and fishermen's groups in central and southern Taiwan
said Sunday they would take President Ma Ying-jeou at his word that currently
banned Chinese agricultural products would not be brought into Taiwan under the
country's proposed trade pact with China.</P>
      <P>In a telephone interview with the Central News Agency, Liao Cheng-hsian,
secretary-general  of the Farmers' Association of Changhua County, said he
believes the president will follow through on his promise, which has already
been conveyed to the country's farmers through Council of Agriculture Minister
Chen Wu-hsiung.</P>
      <P>He said, however, that the government should come up with measures to help
industries that are expected to bear the brunt of the negative impact of the
proposed pact with China.</P>
      <P>Chen Yu-ling, an official with the Fishermen's Association of Linbian Township
in Pingtung County in southern Taiwan, told CNA by phone that Taiwan's
agricultural products are more competitive than those from China, so she was not
worried about potential competition from the mainland.</P>
      <P>As long as the government can screen out inferior Chinese goods, competition
will only stimulate local farmers and fishermen to improve the quality of their
products to capture customers, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Ma reiterated his promise Sunday in a televised debate with Democratic
Progressive Party Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen on the merits of the proposed pact
with China.</P>
      <P>Tsai argued that the pact, once inked, will obligate Taiwan to open its market
to 90 percent of China's products under the rules of the World Trade
Organization (WTO), meaning that Taiwan will have to open its market wider to
Chinese agricultural products that are currently barred, to the detriment of the
country's farmers.</P>
      <P>But Ma said the obligation is not necessarily inherent to free trade pacts,
citing a number of other free trade deals that have been signed around the
world.</P>
      <P>An agricultural official who spoke on condition of anonymity told CNA that
Taiwan's free trade pact with Guatemala is a good example, because 15 percent of

    <HEADLINE>President, DPP leader welcome more discussions on ECFA</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Both President Ma Ying-jeou and opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
Chairperson Tsai Ing-wen said after their historic debate Sunday that they
welcomed more discussion on a proposed contentious trade pact with China.</P>
      <P>The 150-minute televised debate on the Ma administration's plan to sign an
economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) with China marked a new step in
Taiwan's democracy. Never before had the country's head of state engaged an
opposition leader in a public policy debate.</P>
      <P>"The event will contribute  to the deepening  of Taiwan's democratization, " Ma,
who concurrently heads the ruling Kuomintang, said at a post-debate news
conference.</P>
      <P>Although the debate featured biting dialogue, Ma praised Tsai for her
professionalism,  sincerity and open-mindedness  during the showdown.</P>
      <P>He further said the debate has helped him better understand the opposition
camp's major concerns about the proposed trade pact with China.</P>
      <P>"The government cannot afford to ignore public misgivings or fears, " Ma said,
adding that he will see what the government can further do to alleviate public
misgivings about the ECFA deal.</P>
      <P>The debate began with Ma and Tsai each giving an eight-minute presentation  on
their stances  on the deal,  followed  by a cross-examination period when each
asked the other person five questions. Each then delivered a six-minute
concluding statement.</P>
      <P>In the debate, Ma said ECFA is essential to revive Taiwan's trade
competitiveness and shield Taiwan from being marginalized amid mounting regional
economic integration.</P>
      <P>"If we don't do this deal, what else can we do? As the rest of Asia is building
alliances, we and North Korea could be eliminated and become Asia's orphaned
birds," Ma said.</P>
      <P>According to Ma, the agreement will cover three main areas: tariff reductions
and exemptions,  investment  protection,  and intellectual rights protection.</P>
      <P>However, Tsai warned that the deal would flood Taiwan with cheaper Chinese
products and could fuel an increase in property prices.</P>
      <P>She accused Ma of being too bullish on the agreement and of brushing aside what
she described as widespread fears of Beijing's ulterior motives behind its
promise of unilateral concessions in ECFA talks.</P>
      <P>"President Ma, this is not a matter that can be dealt with romantically. It's
something that's rife with many challenges, " she added.</P>
      <P>Tsai expressed regret at a separate news conference that Ma failed to give
convincing responses to many substantive issues she questioned him about in the
debate.</P>
      <P>They included contingency plans the government had if the ECFA talks with China
broke down, the exact amount of tariff benefits Taiwan could reap under the ECFA
deal, and measures to deal with the increasing gap between rich and poor caused
by the deal.</P>
      <P>While the DPP supports the strategy of using the Chinese market to beef up
Taiwan's economic strength, Tsai the DPP calls for developing relations with
China in a gradual manner.</P>
      <P>She further said ECFA not only involves economic issues but will also affect the
balance of power in entire Asia, warning that Taiwan's speedy economic
integration with China may tilt strategic balance of power in Asia.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Lu grabs ATP Challenger title in marathon three-setter</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's Lu Yen-hsun denied Germany's Rainer Schuettler a joyful 34th birthday
celebration Sunday by outlasting his occasional doubles partner 3-6, 7-6 (3) ,
6-3 in the final of the 85,000-euro Status Athens Open.</P>
      <P>The victory in the ATP Challenger event was the world No. 102 Lu's first title
in 2010 and should move him back into the top 90, which will guarantee him
automatic entry into the main draws of grand slam events.</P>
      <P>The 26-year-old Taiwanese, seeded eighth in the tournament, had breezed through
the first four rounds of the tournament without losing a set, while the seventh-
seeded Schuettler had been stretched to three sets twice.</P>
      <P>At the age of 34, considered ancient in men's tennis, Schuettler could have been
forgiven if he showed signs of fatigue in the final, but he pushed his opponent
all the way in the 2 hour, 26 minute battle.</P>
      <P>Lu got off to a horrible start, spotting the German the first 12 points of the
match to quickly fall behind 3-0.</P>
      <P>He fought back and had two break points to keep the set alive with Schuettler
serving at 5-4, but the former Australian Open finalist saved them and closed
out the set.</P>
      <P>In the second set, Lu ran off the final four points of the tiebreaker to pull
even at a set apiece, and then moved clear of his German rival midway through
the third set with only his second service break of the match.</P>
      <P>The Taiwanese served out the final game at love to win his first tournament
since taking an ATP Challenger event in South Korea last November, earning him
12,250 euros in prize money.</P>
      <P>Opting to play more top-level ATP Tour events over the past 10 months, Lu has
seen his ranking fall from a career high 55 in June 2009 after a string of mixed
results against top-flight competition.</P>
      <P>Twice this year, he has faced American Andy Roddick in the second rounds of the
ATP Tour events, and lost in straight sets both times.</P>
      <P>But rather than playing top-flight tourneys during the ATP's claycourt season
leading up to the French Open in late May, Lu decided to enter second tier
Challenger events, such as this week's 85,000-euro Athens event, on his
preferred hardcourt surface to rack up ranking points, in part to ensure he will
get free entry into the Wimbledon draw.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP to press ahead with ECFA referendum after debate</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party will continue to push for a
referendum on the proposed economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) with
China, the party's chairwoman, Tsai Ing-wen, said Sunday.</P>
      <P>"Our position on the referendum is very clear. We will press on toward the goal
together with our ally, the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) , " Tsai said in a
news conference held immediately after her debate on the trade pact with
President Ma Ying-jeou.</P>
      <P>As a responsible leader, Ma should help facilitate the referendum and even have
legislators from his Kuomintang cooperate with the DPP in promoting the vote,
Tsai said.</P>
      <P>She also said she could not remember  Ma "answering  any substantive questions"
throughout the entire debate. However, she said, the DPP will welcome any chance
for further debate on the issue.</P>
      <P>On whether  to go ahead  with a plan to hold a massive demonstration against the
ECFA, Tsai said her party will watch if Ma will adjust its attitude and drop the
thinking that the agreement "must be signed no matter what" in June.</P>
      <P>In the debate, the opposition leader described the ECFA policy as an ill-advised
one that is based on a miscalculation of Taiwan's international situation.</P>
      <P>She warned that Taiwan's premature economic integration with China could tilt
the strategic balance in East Asia and even the whole of Asia.</P>
      <P>The agreement will also force Taiwan to fully open its market to China in the
next 10 years, leaving many Taiwan people out of work, according to Tsai.</P>
      <P>In a separate news conference, Ma said he looks forward to holding further
discussions with Tsai on the issue and that he will see if there are other
things his administration can do to clear up the doubts held by the public.</P>
      <P>Ma said the public should not see the signing of the ECFA as Taiwan taking a
risk.</P>
      <P>"If the agreement is signed, Taiwan's economic and trade status in East Asia
will be very different," the president said.</P>
      <P>On the referendum issue,  Ma reiterated that initiating a referendum is part of
the people's rights and that the government will not interfere as long as such
an initiative is consistent with the law.</P>
      <P>However, the government will not launch a referendum on the ECFA, because under
the Referendum Act, the government is forbidden from doing so unless there is a
situation threatening national security.</P>
      <P>On Thursday, the TSU filed a new petition with the Central Election Commission
for a referendum on the ECFA, eight months after a previous petition filed by
the DPP was rejected.</P>
      <P>The CEC will meet May 4 to determine if the new proposal meets legal
requirements.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou unveiled on Sunday a plan to assemble a task force that
he will lead to facilitate Taiwan's efforts to negotiate free trade agreements
with its major trade partners.</P>
      <P>In his closing remarks in a debate with the opposition Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) Chairperson Tsai Ing-wen on the merits of a proposed economic
cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) with China, Ma broached the plan as he
defended the pact, which he said would help counter the formation of regional
trade blocs.</P>
      <P>Japan, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations countries have
forged or are seeking to form trade partnership relations with China to achieve
mutual economic and trade benefits and enhance their competitiveness, Ma said.</P>
      <P>But Taiwan did not make any progress in improving its economic status under the
rule of the previous DPP government due to the closed mind-set of the party, he
said.</P>
      <P>"Others have already run four or five laps while we're still tying our
shoelaces. How much longer can we wait? Do we want to win or not?" he said.</P>
      <P>Key to the effort, Ma said, is signing the ECFA, which will give new life to
Taiwan's economy and create jobs, and then making renewed efforts to sign free
trade agreements (FTAs) with other major trading partners.</P>
      <P>To expedite the process, Ma said he will lead the FTA task force on signing FTAs
with other countries, and urged China not to block Taiwan's pursuit of free
trade deals with them.</P>
      <P>In her closing remarks, Tsai summarized the "unprecedented negative impact" the
proposed ECFA would have on some local sectors, particularly low-end industries.</P>
      <P>Questioning Ma's assurances that the government would safeguard the country's
interests, Tsai asked how people could trust him after he has been unable to
fulfill his campaign promise to raise economic growth to 6 percent, reduce
unemployment to 3 percent, and raise per capita income to US$30,000.</P>
      <P>Rather than the government providing assurances, Tsai urged Ma to come up with
concrete  measures  to particularly  protect the disadvantaged, farmers and wage
earners who are expected to be affected the most by the ECFA.</P>
      <P>She also panned the government's focus on ECFA, saying there were many difficult
issues facing the country, such as an aging society, a weak job market, an
imbalance between urban and rural development and natural disaster prevention
that also required attention.</P>
      <P>The country's  economic  policy should also encompass  the adjustment of
Taiwan's economic structure, industrial development and financial policy, Tsai
added.</P>
      <P>Signing the ECFA, she said, is not only the option, suggesting that Taiwan can
also seek to forge closer economic and trade relations with other countries
under the frameworks of the World Trade Organization and the Asia Pacific
Economic Cooperation, she noted.</P>
      <P>Tsai contended that there is no need for Taiwan to rush to sign an ECFA in June
as the Ma administration hopes. Instead, Taiwan should pursue FTAs with other
countries at the same time.</P>

    <HEADLINE>President, DPP leader welcome more discussions on ECFA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 25 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Both President Ma Ying-jeou and opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
Chairperson Tsai Ing-wen said after their historic debate Sunday that they
welcomed more discussion on a proposed contentious trade pact with China.</P>
      <P>The 150-minute televised debate on the Ma administration's plan to sign an
economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) with China marked a new step in
Taiwan's democracy. Never before had the country's head of state engaged an
opposition leader in a public policy debate.</P>
      <P>"The event will contribute  to the deepening  of Taiwan's democratization, " Ma,
who concurrently heads the ruling Kuomintang, said at a post-debate news
conference.</P>
      <P>Although the debate featured biting dialogue, Ma praised Tsai for her
professionalism,  sincerity and open-mindedness  during the showdown.</P>
      <P>He further said the debate has helped him better understand the opposition
camp's major concerns about the proposed trade pact with China.</P>
      <P>"The government cannot afford to ignore public misgivings or fears, " Ma said,
adding that he will see what the government can further do to alleviate public
misgivings about the ECFA deal.</P>
      <P>The debate began with Ma and Tsai each giving an eight-minute presentation  on
their stances  on the deal,  followed  by a cross-examination period when each
asked the other person five questions. Each then delivered a six-minute
concluding statement.</P>
      <P>In the debate, Ma said ECFA is essential to revive Taiwan's trade
competitiveness and shield Taiwan from being marginalized amid mounting regional
economic integration.</P>
      <P>"If we don't do this deal, what else can we do? As the rest of Asia is building
alliances, we and North Korea could be eliminated and become Asia's orphaned
birds," Ma said.</P>
      <P>According to Ma, the agreement will cover three main areas: tariff reductions
and exemptions,  investment  protection,  and intellectual rights protection.</P>
      <P>However, Tsai warned that the deal would flood Taiwan with cheaper Chinese
products and could fuel an increase in property prices.</P>
      <P>She accused Ma of being too bullish on the agreement and of brushing aside what
she described as widespread fears of Beijing's ulterior motives behind its
promise of unilateral concessions in ECFA talks.</P>
      <P>"President Ma, this is not a matter that can be dealt with romantically. It's
something that's rife with many challenges, " she added.</P>
      <P>Tsai expressed regret at a separate news conference that Ma failed to give
convincing responses to many substantive issues she questioned him about in the
debate.</P>
      <P>They included contingency plans the government had if the ECFA talks with China
broke down, the exact amount of tariff benefits Taiwan could reap under the ECFA
deal, and measures to deal with the increasing gap between rich and poor caused
by the deal.</P>
      <P>While the DPP supports the strategy of using the Chinese market to beef up
Taiwan's economic strength, Tsai the DPP calls for developing relations with
China in a gradual manner.</P>
      <P>She further said ECFA not only involves economic issues but will also affect the
balance of power in entire Asia, warning that Taiwan's speedy economic
integration with China may tilt strategic balance of power in Asia.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Lu grabs ATP Challenger title in marathon three-setter</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 25 (CNA)
04/25/10  23:11:12
(By Luke Sabatier)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's Lu Yen-hsun denied Germany's Rainer Schuettler a joyful 34th birthday
celebration Sunday by outlasting his occasional doubles partner 3-6, 7-6 (3) ,
6-3 in the final of the 85,000-euro Status Athens Open.</P>
      <P>The victory in the ATP Challenger event was the world No. 102 Lu's first title
in 2010 and should move him back into the top 90, which will guarantee him
automatic entry into the main draws of grand slam events.</P>
      <P>The 26-year-old Taiwanese, seeded eighth in the tournament, had breezed through
the first four rounds of the tournament without losing a set, while the seventh-
seeded Schuettler had been stretched to three sets twice.</P>
      <P>At the age of 34, considered ancient in men's tennis, Schuettler could have been
forgiven if he showed signs of fatigue in the final, but he pushed his opponent
all the way in the 2 hour, 26 minute battle.</P>
      <P>Lu got off to a horrible start, spotting the German the first 12 points of the
match to quickly fall behind 3-0.</P>
      <P>He fought back and had two break points to keep the set alive with Schuettler
serving at 5-4, but the former Australian Open finalist saved them and closed
out the set.</P>
      <P>In the second set, Lu ran off the final four points of the tiebreaker to pull
even at a set apiece, and then moved clear of his German rival midway through
the third set with only his second service break of the match.</P>
      <P>The Taiwanese served out the final game at love to win his first tournament
since taking an ATP Challenger event in South Korea last November, earning him
12,250 euros in prize money.</P>
      <P>Opting to play more top-level ATP Tour events over the past 10 months, Lu has
seen his ranking fall from a career high 55 in June 2009 after a string of mixed
results against top-flight competition.</P>
      <P>Twice this year, he has faced American Andy Roddick in the second rounds of the
ATP Tour events, and lost in straight sets both times.</P>
      <P>But rather than playing top-flight tourneys during the ATP's claycourt season
leading up to the French Open in late May, Lu decided to enter second tier
Challenger events, such as this week's 85,000-euro Athens event, on his
preferred hardcourt surface to rack up ranking points, in part to ensure he will
get free entry into the Wimbledon draw.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Liberty Times: Television propaganda on a big scale</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>04/26/10  12:28:26
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The leaders of the ruling and largest opposition parties engaged in an
unprecedented televised debate yesterday on a proposed economic cooperation
framework agreement (ECFA) between Taiwan and China. Disappointingly, President
Ma Ying-jeou, the force behind the ECFA initiative,  failed to offer a clear and
comprehensive policy statement.  His presentation  was nothing  but large-scale
TV propaganda.</P>
      <P>In the debate, Ma avoided giving any direct responses to queries about the trade
pact, including the question of what exactly is the ECFA.</P>
      <P>The other questions asked were: What is the early harvest program? Why the
reluctance to publicize that program? What are the monitoring mechanisms? How
will the ECFA affect Taiwan's economy, particularly the employment market? How
will the pact affect Taiwan's sovereignty? What is Taiwan's economic strategy?</P>
      <P>It seems the Ma administration firmly believes that once it bombards the people
with propaganda, it can fool them into thinking that the ECFA, a poisonous weed,
is in fact a fragrant flower.</P>
      <P>We hereby remind the Ma government that if it respects public opinion it should
follow the rules of a democratic country and put the ECFA issue to referendum so
that the country's 23 million people could decide whether or not Taiwan should
sign the pact. (April 26. 2010).</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou's approval ratings surged after his Sunday debate with
opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairperson Tsai Ing-wen on the
signing of an economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) with China. The
debate might be a boost to his re-election bid for 2012, but has it given the
public a better understanding of the ECFA?</P>
      <P>Ma said in the debate that he will guard Taiwan's sovereignty when signing the
ECFA with China to bolster Taiwan's economy, while Tsai said the pact will put
Taiwan's sovereignty at stake and be harmful to the country's economic standing.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from local media coverage of the issue:</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>A high of 67 percent of the respondents to a poll conducted immediately after
the debate said they are concerned about the ECFA issue, but 59 percent of them
said the debate did not help them find out more about the pros and cons of
Taiwan's signing the ECFA with China.</P>
      <P>Forty-two percent of the respondents to the United Daily News poll said they
support the government's bid to forge the ECFA with China, while 30 percent were
opposed and 28 percent offered no opinion.</P>
      <P>Of the supporters of the ECFA, some 50 percent-60 percent were company owners or
white-collar office workers. People from the agricultural, fishery and husbandry
sectors showed the highest concern about the ECFA, with less than 20 percent
supporting the bid and 49 percent opposed. (April 26, 2010).</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>A total of 53 percent of the respondents to a survey conducted by the Want Want
China Times Poll Center Sunday said they watched Sunday's televised debate and
47 percent said they did not watch it.</P>
      <P>Of the respondents, 41 percent said Ma gave a better performance in the debate
than Tsai, while 28 percent said Tsai performed better and 10 percent considered
the two to be equally matched.</P>
      <P>Sixty-three percent of the respondents said they had a clearer picture about the
ECFA after watching the debate, while 26 percent said the debate did not help
them better understand the cross-strait trade pact.</P>
      <P>After the debate, public support for the ECFA rose to 48 percent, up 7
percentage points posted in a similar poll conducted in early April. (April 26,
2010).</P>
      <P>The Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>Thirty-six percent of the respondents to a poll conducted by the Liberty Times
Sunday said they opposed the ECFA signing, 8 percentage points more than those
who expressed support for it. Thirty-six percent offered no opinion.</P>
      <P>After watching the debate, 80 percent of the respondents said their attitude
toward the bid remained unchanged, and only 7 percent said their attitude had
changed.</P>
      <P>A total of 60 percent said that before Taiwan signs the ECFA with China, the
people should be given a say via a nationwide referendum on the issue, while
23.7 percent said a referendum is not necessary.</P>
      <P>Seventy-nine percent of the respondents said they still did not totally or even
partially understand the trade pact with China, even after watching the Ma-Tsai
debate. (April 26, 2010).</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou exhorted Taiwanese students Monday to pursue advanced
studies in the United States as a means  to  broaden  their  views  and  build
person-to-person relationships.</P>
      <P>During a talk at the Presidential Office with William C. Kirby, a history
professor at Harvard University and director of Harvard's Fairbank Center for
Chinese Studies, Ma said the number of Taiwanese students going to the U.S. for
advanced studies has declined over the past decade, while the number from China
has steadily increased.</P>
      <P>Ma, himself a Harvard alumnus, expressed hope that more students from Taiwan
will attend first-class U.S. universities such as Harvard, for advanced studies.</P>
      <P>"I hope Taiwan can maintain closer contact and cooperation with the academic
sector in the United States," he said.</P>
      <P>He said things have changed since he attended the Harvard Law School 30 years
ago, in that the number of Taiwanese students in the U.S. at that time was much
greater than that of Chinese students. He said the sliding number of Taiwanese
students in the United States could be related to the fact that increasing
numbers of Taiwanese students have been going to the United Kingdom or Australia
to pursue advanced studies.</P>
      <P>The president expressed his appreciation to Kirby for arranging a teleconference
April 6 at the Fairbank Center that allowed him to address Harvard faculty
members and students and take questions from the audience.</P>
      <P>Ma delivered a 20-minute address at the conference, titled "The Quest for
Modernity, " that covered a variety of issues, including Taiwan's experience in
weathering the global economic downturn, the country's policy of pursuing cross-
Taiwan Strait peace and flexible diplomacy, and the country's values of
democracy and freedom.</P>

      <P>An earthquake measuring 6.6 on the open-ended Richter scale struck Taiwan
Monday, the Central Weather Bureau's Seismology Center reported later that day.</P>
      <P>The earthquake hit at 10: 59 a.m., with the epicenter located at sea 190.4 km
northeast of the Lanyu seismic observation station on the outlying island of
Lanyu, also known as Orchid Island, at a depth of 20 km, the center said.</P>
      <P>The earthquake was felt throughout Taiwan, with buildings swaying in Taipei for
up to 20 seconds, but there were no immediate reports of casualties or damage.</P>
      <P>Seismologists said the earthquake was caused by the convergence of the Eurasian
and Philippine Sea tectonic plates, and could be considered a normal release of
energy.</P>
      <P>Earthquakes frequently rattle Taiwan but most are minor and cause little or no
damage. However, a magnitude-7.3 earthquake in central Taiwan on Sept. 21, 1999

    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling and opposition parties outlined their different visions, policies and
strategies toward China through the debate between President Ma Ying-jeou and
opposition Democratic Progressive Party Chairperson Tsai Ing-wen Sunday.</P>
      <P>The economy is Taiwan's lifeline, and Taiwan's economy depends largely on its
trade with other states. In order to maintain its economic competitiveness,
Taiwan has to integrate itself into regional trade blocks, but these efforts
have always been blocked by China.</P>
      <P>In the debate, Ma advocated his views of reconciling with China as a first step
toward enhancing Taiwan's international role.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, Tsai called for engaging with China under a multilateral
framework, warning that a bilateral trade pact with China could contribute to
China's dominance in Asia and paint Taiwan into a corner.</P>
      <P>The advantages and disadvantages of the proposed pact were the focus of their
debate, with Ma saying that the pact will allow Taiwan to make up for the eight
years it lost during the DPP's time in office and usher in a golden decade in
terms of the economy.</P>
      <P>However, Tsai cast doubt on Ma's promise to not allow in any more Chinese
agricultural products, saying that the pact will oblige Taiwan to open its
market to 90 percent or more of Chinese goods tariff-free within 10 years.</P>
      <P>Ma argued that this obligation is not necessarily part of a trade pact and that
such obligations vary in time-frame and extent from deal to deal.</P>
      <P>Tsai floated an alternative to the pact, suggesting negotiations with China on
various issues separately, such as tariff exemptions, investment protection and
intellectual property rights protection, rather than a single trade pact.</P>
      <P>If Tsai's proposal were to be implemented in the next decade, it would not
really be contrary to the government's plan.</P>
      <P>The most noteworthy part of the debate is that although there was a trade of
barbs, the two leaders did not find themselves stuck in the mire of partisan
bickering that has been usual for past debates between the two sides.</P>
      <P>We believe that the more such debates continue, the more clearly the facts will
be exposed and the more likely the differences between the two sides will be
ironed out. (April 26, 2010)</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan to enjoy 5.11% economic growth in 2010: think tank</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan will post a growth of 5.11 percent in real gross domestic product (GDP)
in 2010 amid an overall economic recovery, the Taiwan Institute of Economic
Research (TIER) forecast Monday, revising its previous prediction of 4.81
percent.</P>
      <P>The latest figure represents a reversal from a 1.87 percent GDP contraction
recorded in 2009, the TIER said in its monthly economic report released that
day.</P>
      <P>The institute also forecast that annual economic growth will reach 9.64 percent
in the first quarter of the year, followed by 7.19 percent in Q2, 3.11 percent
in Q3 and 1.52 percent in Q4.</P>
      <P>TIER Macroeconomic Forecasting Center Director Chen Miao said the upward
adjustment  of the GDP growth in 2010 was made after researchers observed
trends, including an increase in corporate intention and ability to launch
investment projects.</P>
      <P>Judging from that, TIER predicted that the investment growth rate will rise to
15.3 percent this year,  while exports of both commodities and services will
grow by 16.92 percent, Chen said.</P>
      <P>In terms of private consumption, Chen said, TIER kept its previous forecast of
2.07 percent growth unchanged because the researchers did not see any factors
that would affect the growth rate.</P>
      <P>TIER President David S. Hong pointed out that the private consumption growth
rate has rarely surpassed the 3 percent mark since 2000, restrained by
unemployment and consumer prices.</P>
      <P>In the TIER report, Taiwan's exports are projected to grow 26.83 percent and
imports by 33.87 percent this year, which would translate into a trade surplus
of US$24.879 billion.</P>
      <P>TIER also forecast that wholesale prices will move higher by 5.27 percent due to
increasing global demand and inflation caused by depreciation of the U.S.
dollar.</P>
      <P>Consumer  prices  are  anticipated  to grow  1.77  percent year-on-year,
resulted from rising costs of raw materials and fuel, the report went on.</P>
      <P>In terms of the local currency, the institute predicted that the New Taiwan
dollar will see a trend of appreciation this year thanks to increasing demand
for the major Asian currencies and a market situation that will put pressure on
the U.S. dollar to depreciate.</P>
      <P>In this regard, the institute forecast that the local unit will stand at an
average of NT$31.35 against the greenback this year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>China Times: Ma regains confidence through debate</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>04/26/10  15:29:43
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou demonstrated leadership in Sunday's debate and many
political pundits said it brought out the best in him for the first time since
2008.</P>
      <P>At the beginning of the debate, Ma pointed out the contradictions in the
Democratic Progressive Party's criticism of the proposed trade pact with China,
saying that when the DPP was in power it had approved the importation of 900
Chinese agricultural items, while his administration has approved none.</P>
      <P>Also, the direct air links between Taiwan and China and Taiwan's wider opening
to Chinese tourists began under the DPP administration, but were maintained only
on a small scale throughout the DPP's eight years in power, he said.</P>
      <P>Worst of all, Taiwan's global competitiveness ranking slid from 14th to 18th
under the DPP administration, he added.</P>
      <P>At the conclusion of the debate, the president foiled his rival's arguments by
noting that the DPP's manifesto states Taiwan should develop comprehensive
exchanges with China, including economic and trade cooperation, and seek long-
term peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Like a true leader, Ma said that he is well aware of Beijing political designs
regarding Taiwan, but gave the assurance that he will not ink any pact with
China unless it is beneficial to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He said he will personally lead a government task force that will be responsible
for seeking free trade agreements  with other countries, and he urged Beijing
not to block Taiwan's efforts to achieve this goal.</P>
      <P>Democratic  Progressive  Party  Chairperson  Tsai  Ing-wen's performance paled
in comparison to Ma's because she could not afford to offend her party base and
was saddled with the DPP's poor record of governance.</P>
      <P>She asked Ma why not forge free trade pacts with other states, but this is
exactly what the DPP failed to do while in office. Then she expressed doubts
that an "ASEAN plus three" economic grouping would ever materialize, ignoring
the fact that the trade bloc was launched at the beginning of this year.</P>
      <P>Her biggest accusation was that cross-strait trade is being dominated by
relatives of top officials on both sides of the Taiwan Strait, but she was
unable to provide any supporting facts and her charge was easily deflected by
Ma. He promised to prosecute to the full extent of law anyone found guilty of
Tsai's charge.</P>
      <P>In the news conference after the debate, Tsai kept criticizing Ma, while Ma
praised Tsai's performance and said he looked forward to other such exchanges
with her.</P>
      <P>The president gave voice to the people's views that Taiwanese are courageous and
confident. We are pleased to see that the president is also confident. (April

      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih officiated at a groundbreaking ceremony Monday to kick off
the construction of permanent housing in the southernmost county of Pingtung for
people displaced by Typhoon Morakot last August.</P>
      <P>The housing  project,  authorized  by the Pingtung  county government, will be
carried out by non-profit charity organization the Buddhist Compassion Relief
Tzu Chi Foundation in Pingtung's Changjhih Township.</P>
      <P>The project, to be known as the Changjhih Tzu Chi Da Ai Community upon
completion, will be located on a 30-hectare plot that used to house the Pingtung
branch of the semi-official Central Broadcasting System of the Republic of
China.</P>
      <P>A total of 167 housing units will be built in the first phase of the project to
accommodate Morakot victims from the county's Sandimen and Wutai townships.</P>
      <P>Addressing the ceremony, Wu said Typhoon Morakot, one of the worst natural
disasters to hit Taiwan that left more than 700 people dead or missing and more
than 10,000 families homeless, has served to tap people's empathy for each other
and to strengthen person-to-person ties.</P>
      <P>He expressed appreciation to the Tzu Chi Foundation for its empathy and
magnanimity toward the displaced Pingtung residents, most of whom are indigenous
people.</P>
      <P>One of the affected villagers also expressed his gratitude at the ceremony to
the Pingtung county government and to the Tzu Chi Foundation for providing the
housing, which he praised as having "a great design."</P>

      <P>The Ministry of the Interior (MOI) will formulate a package of regulations
within three months, requiring that information on real estate transactions be

      <P>Jiang said at a legislative session that his ministry is mapping out

    <TEXT>
      <P>Tilapia growers in Liuchia in southern Taiwan's Tainan County threw a banquet
Sunday to promote their product in the domestic market amid falling exports and
strong competition from China.</P>
      <P>With more and more Taiwan's tilapia farmers relocating their investments to
China, the island's tilapia business has seen a steep decline in exports, while
China's exports of the fish have jumped.</P>
      <P>According to the United Evening News, China's frozen tilapia exports to the U.S.
totalled 29,672 metric tons in 2009, while Taiwan's were 13,180 metric tons.
China's frozen tilapia fillet sales to the U.S. last year hit 10,691 metric
tons, far in excess of Taiwan's 2,333 metric tons.</P>
      <P>China is now the largest tilapia exporter to the U.S., the newspaper said.</P>
      <P>In an effort to mitigate the effects of weakening exports, local tilapia farmers
are giving more attention to the domestic market. However, an increase in local
supply has dragged down domestic prices by 29 percent to 34 percent.</P>
      <P>About 90 percent of Taiwan's tilapia species are being grown in China as the
industry is moving more and more of its capital there. In addition, Taiwan
investors have taken Taiwan's advanced breeding technologies to China, which is
now producing a better quality product than Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Hung San-yi, secretary general of the Tainan fishery association, said China's
strength in the aquaculture business cannot be ignored. The Taiwan government
and the industry itself will have to figure out the best strategy to combat the
stiff competition from China, he added.</P>
      <P>Su Huan-chih, magistrate of Tainan County which is the center of tilapia
breeding in Taiwan, said the government has to come up with concrete measures to
enhance Taiwan's global distribution network and also has to establish a
certification mechanism to differentiate between the products on the two sides
of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Su said he is worried that Taiwan's tilapia growers will suffer even more once
an economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) with China is signed as it
will require Taiwan to eventually open its market wider to Chinese products.</P>
      <P>In the next round of high-level cross-strait  negotiations scheduled for the
middle of this year, Taiwan will seek to include protective measures in relevant
agreements to protect the local agriculture sector from the effects of a wider
market opening, according to the Council of Agricu lture (COA).</P>
      <P>In addition, local agricultural businesses are expected to be required to pay a
significant sum for licenses to move their operations to China, the COA said.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the COA said, Taiwan will implement strict rules on place-of-origin
identification of its fishery products.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A public hearing was held Monday by the Central Election Commission to sound out
public opinion on the redrawing of lawmakers' constituencies in three of the
four new special municipalities to be formed by the end of this year.</P>
      <P>Teng Tien-you, secretary-general of the commission, said the redrawing of the
constituencies is necessary for the municipalities of Taichung, which will be
formed through a merger of the existing Taichung City and Taichung County;
Tainan, which will consist of a merger of the existing Tainan City and Tainan
County; and Kaohsiung, which will be a merger of the existing Kaohsiung County
and Kaohsiung City.</P>
      <P>In the three new municipalities, the number of lawmakers in Kaohsiung will total
eight, one seat less than the combined number of the present Kaohsiung City and
Kaohsiung County, and six in Tainan, one seat more than the combined number in
Tainan County and Tainan City. The actual number of seats will remain unchanged
in Taichung.</P>
      <P>Redrawing the lawmaker's constituencies is not necessary in the two other
municipalities -- the already existing Taipei City and the upgraded Taipei
County, to be called Xinbei City -- because their administrative regions will
not be changed.</P>
      <P>Teng said the redrawing of the constituencies will be finished and presented to
the Legislative Yuan for approval by May 31 as required by law.</P>
      <P>Hsu Yang-ming, deputy mayor of Tainan City, opposed the redrawing at the
hearing, saying that the constituencies were redrawn as recently as 2007 and are
set to be divided yet again after the redrawing of administrative districts in
the new municipalities that is set to take place after municipality chief
elections at the end of this year.</P>
      <P>He suggested leaving the existing constituencies unchanged until the redrawing
of administrative districts in the new municipalities.</P>
      <P>His opinion was supported by Legislator Huang Chao-shun, a ruling  Kuomintang
lawmaker  from Kaohsiung.  Huang said the commission's plan to cut the number of
Kaohsiung lawmakers by one is certain to be rejected by the Legislative Yuan,
along with its plan to drastically re-organize the municipality's
constituencies.</P>
      <P>Instead of changing the constituencies, she suggested, the commission should ask
the Legislature Yuan to leave them unchanged.</P>
      <P>However, Teng said the commission will carry out its duties according to the
law.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih Monday ordered more manpower and machinery to be employed for
rescue missions on the No. 3 Freeway between Taipei and Keelung in northern
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"Saving lives is the current priority, " he said during a visit to southern
Taiwan's Pingtung County. Meanwhile, he added, the Ministry of Transportation
and Communications and the Keelung City government have outlined transportation
alternatives for commuters on the national freeway.</P>
      <P>Without an obvious cause like an earthquake or human activity, a slope slid the
previous day from the eastern side of the freeway at the 3.1-kilometer mark from
the northern end, just north of the Chitu toll station, burying more than 300
meters of road.</P>
      <P>Earlier Monday, the Keelung City Fire Bureau said it had received nine phone
calls for help to search for missing cars after the incident occurred.  It
contacted the owners of seven vehicles suspected of being buried in landslide,
but there are still two cars missing, the bureau said.</P>
      <P>As of noon Monday, no people or vehicles had been discovered in the dirt and
rocks that buried the freeway. Taiwan Area National Freeway Bureau Director
General Tseng Ta-jen said efforts to clear the road were proceeding faster than
scheduled.</P>
      <P>"The work is expected to be completed two weeks ahead of plans, " he said,
noting that it is still unclear whether people are trapped in the rubble.</P>
      <P>According to Tseng, nearly 120 vehicles, including 45 excavators, and over 900
personnel had been mobilized for the project.</P>
      <P>It was estimated that 200,000 cubic meters of dirt and rocks poured onto the
road in what was the worst landslide ever on a freeway in the country, the
national freeway bureau said.</P>
      <P>Lin Chao-chung, director of the Ministry of Economic Affairs' Central Geological
Survey, attributed the landslide to rock anchors -- steel reinforcers -- in
restraining walls along the freeways.</P>
      <P>Faulty construction or wear on the anchors could have led to the slide, Lin
said.</P>
      <P>An investigation into the incident has been launched.</P>
      <P>That section of the freeway was opened in 2000.</P>
      <P>The 430.5 km-long No.  3 National Freeway was the second North-South freeway
built in Taiwan. It begins at Jijin Interchange on Provincial Highway No. 2, or
Jijin Road, in Keelung City and ends on Provincial Highway No. 17 in Pingtung
County's Linbian. The construction began in 1987, and the first completed
section was opened for traffic in 1993.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's  growing service sector, particularly tourism, has the potential to
strengthen the local job market and mitigate the impact of structural
unemployment, a think tank said Monday.</P>
      <P>David Hong, president of the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research (TIER) , said
the service sector accounts for 70 percent of Taiwan's gross domestic product
(GDP) , and if it can sustain its growth, the domestic job market will improve
accordingly.</P>
      <P>He specifically cited the tourism, retail, and health care sectors as labor-
intensive service industries that could offset unemployment caused by structural
changes to the local economy, such as factories relocating offshore.</P>
      <P>Tourism especially has been one of the bright spots in the domestic economy,
fueled by a dramatic rise in the number of Chinese visitors in the first quarter
of the year as cross-Taiwan Strait ties improve.</P>
      <P>A total of 344,136 Chinese nationals visited Taiwan in the first three months of
2010, up 98.64 percent from a year earlier, making China the largest source of
visitors to the island. More than 1 million Chinese arrivals are expected this
year.</P>
      <P>Hong cautioned, however, that as local businesses continue to move overseas, the
country's jobless rate, which fell slightly in March to 5.67 percent, is
unlikely to drop below 3 percent in the near future.</P>
      <P>During his election campaign in early 2008,  President Ma Ying-jeou pledged to
bring unemployment down to 3 percent during his term, but that goal was derailed
when the global financial crisis took its toll on Taiwan's economy.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the think tank revised its forecast of Taiwan's 2010 GDP growth to
5.11 percent from a previous estimate of 4.81 percent on rising investment as
the global economy recovers.</P>
      <P>It also expected private consumption in 2010 to grow 2.07 percent, compared with
1.48 percent in 2009.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) Minister Wang Ju-hsuan reiterated Monday that she
will step down if wages for foreign workers are delinked from the nation's
minimum wage.</P>
      <P>After Premier Wu Den-yih floated the concept earlier in the month that the link
should be removed within certain economic and trade zones to allow lower wages
for foreign workers and thereby attract foreign investment, ruling Kuomintang
Legislator Luo Shu-lei brought forward a proposal to amend the Labor Standards
Act to abolish the regulation that applies the country's minimum wage of
NT$17,280 to migrant workers.</P>
      <P>The proposed amendments have sparked outrage and protests among labor and
immigrant advocacy groups, some of which rallied in front of the Legislative
Yuan Monday, demanding that Wang resign over the matter.</P>
      <P>Pressured by opposition Democratic Progressive  Party (DPP) Legislator Huang
Sue-ying, Wang said at a legislative session that she remained consistent in her
opposition to the delinkage and that she made it clear long before she assumed
her post that she would resign if she failed to uphold the bottom line.</P>
      <P>No other countries that have adopted a minimum wage policy have waived the
minimum wage requirement for migrant workers, Wang argued.</P>
      <P>According to Wang, there is no legal minimum wage in Singapore or Hong Kong,
where salaries are usually negotiated between employers and employees based on
what the job entails. Despite this, the wages paid to foreign workers in the two
countries are similar to those in Taiwan, she added.</P>
      <P>Wang said one employer told her that a U.S. human rights report ranking Taiwan
as a place unfriendly to foreign workers once caused him to lose an order worth
NT$50 million (US$1.59 million). If the link is removed, the situation will
become even worse and create an even greater barrier for Taiwan to negotiate

      <P>Taiwan is likely to be affected by a dust storm swept over from China as early
as Tuesday afternoon, the Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) warned
Monday.</P>
      <P>According to the EPA, sand particles in the air could reach 350 micrograms per
cubic meter, which is five to six times the normal amount.</P>
      <P>However, with a cold front affecting Taiwan late Monday, showers were expected
across the country, which could alleviate the effects of the pollution, the EPA
said, adding that the extent of the impact will depend on the actual amount of
rain, as well as the wind direction.</P>
      <P>Chu Yu-chi, director-general of the EPA's environmental monitoring and
information management unit, said that since the weather tends to be unstable in
the spring, the routes and durations of dust storms are difficult to predict.</P>
      <P>The EPA placed further information on the dust storm on its website at

(MOU) Monday with Michael T.L. Lin, deputy CEO of the Taiwan Design Center, to
become one of the global partners of the 2011 International Design Alliance
(IDA) Design Congress Taipei.</P>
      <P>The red dot design award is a large and coveted international product  design

aim of the prize is to honor outstanding design quality. It has been described
as the "Oscars of the design field" and is one of the most important design
awards in the world.</P>
      <P>"Through cooperation with the organization, Taiwan can extend its connections
with other countries in Europe, " said Connie Chang, a senior specialist  of the
knowledge  services division of the Industrial Development Bureau under the
Ministry of Economic Affairs.</P>
      <P>The 2011 IDA Congress will be held Oct. 24-26 next year in Taipei, and will be
the first congress since the establishment of the IDA in 2007, said Lin, who is
one of the organizers.</P>
      <P>Lin said the congress is expected to attract a lot of overseas designers, as the
IDL has also signed MOUs with six associations from Thailand, Japan and several
other countries.</P>
      <P>"This year, Taiwan has 68 creative products that have won red dot awards," he
added.</P>
      <P>Zec lauded the achievements Taiwan has made in the awards, saying they are "the

Monday, a move aimed at helping boost the number of its stored value EasyCards
in circulation by 10 percent before the end of the year, a company official said
Monday.</P>
      <P>Sean Lien, the company's chairman, said the average number of transactions with

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou on Monday hailed CSBC Corp., Taiwan's delivery of three
container ships to a German customer in a single day, saying it was a feat
rarely seen even in major shipbuilding countries such as Japan and South Korea.</P>
      <P>Addressing a joint christening and delivery ceremony for the three ships at a
CSBC shipyard in the southern port city of Kaohsiung, Ma also lauded German
shipping company Peter Dohle Schiffahrts-KG for its decision not to cancel its
orders with CSBC despite the 2008-2009 global financial crisis.</P>
      <P>"I came here to especially express my gratefulness to Peter Dohle and other
companies that decided not to cancel the orders. This is obviously a wise
decision, " Ma said at the ceremony.</P>
      <P>"I also want to stress it is our strategy for making Taiwan the innovation
center of the world, the springboard for investment in Asia, and the global
headquarters location for Taiwanese companies and regional headquarters location
for multinational corporations, " the president said.</P>
      <P>More than a year ago, Ma said, Taiwan's economy faced harsh challenges amid a
global economic downturn. Through concerted public and private efforts, Taiwan
has emerged from a year-long recession, with exports rebounding almost to pre-
crisis levels, he added.</P>
      <P>Citing a recent International Monetary Fund (IMF) forecast, Ma said Taiwan is
expected to outpace the other Asian Tigers -- South Korea, Hong Kong and
Singapore -- with a 6.5 percent growth rate, coupled with a 1.5 percent
inflation rate.</P>
      <P>Moreover, he said, the IMF report predicts Taiwan will lead the three other
Asian Tigers for most of the next five years.</P>
      <P>Ma further said he hopes the current export recovery will help fuel growth in
various industrial sectors, including the shipbuilding industry, so that Taiwan
can realize its ambitious goal of connecting with the Asia Pacific region and
reaching out to the world.</P>
      <P>The ships delivered  Monday include two vessels  that can accommodate 6,600
20-foot containers and one ship capable of carrying 4,200 20-foot containers.</P>

      <P>The Guang Hua Digital Plaza, one of Taiwan's most famous technological and
electronic goods malls, has come a long way since its original incarnation as a
grubby and dank market, and now attracts more than 15,000 customers on weekdays
and around 23,000 on weekends.</P>
      <P>The original Guang Hua market, which was a crowded warren of tiny aisles
established in 1973 under the Guang Hua Bridge, formerly specialized in used
books, athletic products and to a far lesser extent in computer hardware.</P>
      <P>When the bridge was demolished as part of a road-widening project, the market
moved to its present location, a purpose-built building at the corner of Jinshan
North Road and Civic Boulevard.</P>
      <P>The cluster effect of sellers has made the plaza a Mecca for 3C electronics
customers and ensures that the merchandise remains competitive in terms of price
and quality, market analysts said.</P>
      <P>Lin Wen-wei, owner of De Tzung Computers in the plaza, applauded the city
government's relocation of the market.</P>
      <P>To make sure the plaza and the surrounding district continues to provide 3C
goods, the Taipei city government is launching the second phase of a BOT project
to develop the plot of land immediately to the west of the plaza into a digital
theme park and an animation merchandise mall.</P>

      <P>The ruling Kuomintang (KMT) plans to conduct nominations in two rounds for the
year-end five special municipality mayoral elections, with all the five
candidates to be finalized by May 19, KMT spokesman Su Jun-pin said Monday.</P>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin, Vice Premier Eric Liluan Chu, Taichung Mayor Jason Hu
and Legislator Huang Chao-shun are likely candidates to represent the KMT in the
Nov. 27 elections in Taipei City, Xinbei City, Greater Taichung City and Greater
Kaohsiung City.</P>
      <P>In Greater Tainan City, two potential contenders -- former KMT lawmakers Lee
Chuan-chiao and Kuo Tien-tsai -- are within the statistical margin of error
after two polls and the party will begin mediation efforts between them to
single out the best candidate, Su said.</P>
      <P>Kuo had a slim lead over Lee in both of the polls, a KMT source disclosed.</P>
      <P>The nominations will be passed on to a KMT task force charged with consulting
candidates and screened by a nomination review committee  before being submitted
to the KMT Central Standing Committee for final approval.</P>
      <P>Other than the nominee for Tainan, the candidates for the other four special
municipalities will be finalized in the first round of nominations, Su said.</P>

      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) announced Monday that the party drug mephedrone
was found for the first time in Taiwan recently, and it warned the public of the
serious effects it can have on people's health and lives.</P>
      <P>According to the Food and Drug Administration under the DOH, some drugs
containing mephedrone were found in a batch of illegal drugs seized by the
Aviation Police Office recently.</P>
      <P>Cheng Chin-feng, an official with the Division of Controlled Drugs, said that
according to information obtained, mephedrone is a new substance produced in
China that was exported to Europe as a chemical fertilizer beginning in 2008.</P>
      <P>Because the substance is relatively new, all that's known about its composition
is that it is similar to amphetamine, Cheng said.</P>
      <P>As the drug only takes a short time to exert its effect, users may keep applying
the drugs, and that may cause severe constriction of the blood vessels, heart
attack, irregular pulse, anxiety, and even death, he said.</P>
      <P>Mephedrone, also known as meow meow, Meow, or M-Cat, is now officially a Class B
controlled drug in the U.K., and an illegal drug in Germany and Sweden.</P>
      <P>Worried about the spread of the new drug, the DOH will recommend to the Ministry
of Justice that it classify mephedrone as a controlled drug, Cheng said.</P>
      <P>He indicated that mephedrone has caused many deaths in other countries, citing a
girl in the U.K. who died just a few hours after taking a drug containing both
ketamine and mephedrone.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's government should create an environment favorable for local
shipbuilding companies to compete with their foreign rivals, the head of the
country's largest shipbuilder urged Monday.</P>
      <P>CSBC Corporation, Taiwan Chairman Cheng Wen-lon made the appeal in an interview
with the Central News Agency on the sidelines of a ceremony celebrating the
delivery of three CSBC-built container vessels to German shipping company Peter
Dohle Schiffahrts-KG.</P>
      <P>One of the most effective steps the government could take to boost the
competitiveness of local shipbuilders would be to permit Taiwanese banks to
offer financing to potential foreign buyers, Cheng said.</P>
      <P>Insisting that CSBC can compete technologically with Japanese, Korean and
Chinese shipbuilders, Cheng said it would gain more leverage in pursuing foreign
orders if local banks were allowed to provide financing to its potential
customers.</P>
      <P>China, Japan and South Korea jointly control 90 percent of the world's total
commercial shipbuilding market, while Taiwan only has a 0.8 percent share, Cheng
said.</P>
      <P>"What we rely on in competing with foreign shipbuilders is our technical
expertise and our fine workmanship and quality, " Cheng said proudly. But the
company would do better if the government could create a business environment on
a par with the major shipbuilding countries, he said.</P>
      <P>Noting that China has done much to prop up its shipbuilding industry, Cheng said
Japan, South Korea and other powers in the industry have all offered financing
on attractive terms to help attract foreign customers for their shipbuilders.</P>
      <P>As for its delivery of the three container vessels Monday, Cheng said it was
fortunate that Peter Dohle only asked for a four-month delay in the delivery of
its ships, considering that the global container shipping industry was hard hit
by the 2008-2009 global financial crisis.</P>
      <P>One of CSBC's customers, an Israeli company, actually canceled its orders
because of the downturn, Cheng said.</P>
      <P>The German company placed orders for 12 container vessels with CSBC in 2006.
After Monday's delivery of two vessels capable of carrying 6,600 20-foot
containers and a vessel that can accommodate 4,200 20-foot containers, six more
vessels are still to be delivered.</P>
      <P>"German shippers are known to be demanding of high quality. Our technology has
helped us secure orders from Peter Dohle, " Cheng said.</P>

      <P>The Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) passed a construction
proposal to add four stations to the Taiwan high speed rail system by 2015 to

      <P>Under the plan, Nangang Station in Taipei City is scheduled to be completed in
October 2012, and Miaoli, Changhua and Yunlin stations are scheduled for June
2015, the official said.</P>
      <P>In January 2010, the daily number of passengers using the rail system averaged
93,000, with an average seat use rate of about 46 percent. After the additional
stations are completed, the passenger load is estimated to increase by 5
percent, the official added.</P>
      <P>The project would cost NT$52 million (US$1.65 million) for construction of
Miaoli, Changhua and Yunlin stations and related facilities, NT$191 million for
compensation for requisition of land and resettlement for residents of
demolished houses, and NT$289 million for construction supervision and
management. The Taiwan High Speed Rail Corp. will provide NT$7.5 billion for the

      <P>The ruling Kuomintang (KMT) plans to conduct nominations in two rounds for the
year-end five special municipality mayoral elections, with all the five
candidates to be finalized by May 19, KMT spokesman Su Jun-pin said Monday.</P>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin, Vice Premier Eric Liluan Chu, Taichung Mayor Jason Hu
and Legislator Huang Chao-shun are likely candidates to represent the KMT in the
Nov. 27 elections in Taipei City, Xinbei City, Greater Taichung City and Greater
Kaohsiung City.</P>
      <P>In Greater Tainan City, two potential contenders -- former KMT lawmakers Lee
Chuan-chiao and Kuo Tien-tsai -- are within the statistical margin of error
after two polls and the party will begin mediation efforts between them to
single out the best candidate, Su said.</P>
      <P>Kuo had a slim lead over Lee in both of the polls, a KMT source disclosed.</P>
      <P>The nominations will be passed on to a KMT task force charged with consulting
candidates and screened by a nomination review committee  before being submitted
to the KMT Central Standing Committee for final approval.</P>
      <P>Other than the nominee for Tainan, the candidates for the other four special
municipalities will be finalized in the first round of nominations, Su said.</P>
      <P>Asked about whether Chu will resign from the post of vice premier if he is
nominated, Su said it would be decided by Chu and Premier Wu Den-yih.</P>
      <P>Chu said a few days ago that he will go all out to win if he is nominated.</P>
      <P>After the elections, Greater Kaohsiung City will be a merger of Kaohsiung City
and Kaohsiung County; Greater Tainan City will be a merger of Tainan City and
Tainan County; Greater Taichung City will be a merger of Taichung City and
Taichung County; and Taipei County will be upgraded to Xinbei City.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Party drug mephedrone found for the first time in Taiwan</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) announced Monday that the party drug mephedrone
was found for the first time in Taiwan recently, and it warned the public of the
serious effects it can have on people's health and lives.</P>
      <P>According to the Food and Drug Administration under the DOH, some drugs
containing mephedrone were found in a batch of illegal drugs seized by the
Aviation Police Office recently.</P>
      <P>Cheng Chin-feng, an official with the Division of Controlled Drugs, said that
according to information obtained, mephedrone is a new substance produced in
China that was exported to Europe as a chemical fertilizer beginning in 2008.</P>
      <P>Because the substance is relatively new, all that's known about its composition
is that it is similar to amphetamine, Cheng said.</P>
      <P>As the drug only takes a short time to exert its effect, users may keep applying
the drugs, and that may cause severe constriction of the blood vessels, heart
attack, irregular pulse, anxiety, and even death, he said.</P>
      <P>Mephedrone, also known as meow meow, Meow, or M-Cat, is now officially a Class B
controlled drug in the U.K., and an illegal drug in Germany and Sweden.</P>
      <P>Worried about the spread of the new drug, the DOH will recommend to the Ministry
of Justice that it classify mephedrone as a controlled drug, Cheng said.</P>
      <P>He indicated that mephedrone has caused many deaths in other countries, citing a
girl in the U.K. who died just a few hours after taking a drug containing both
ketamine and mephedrone.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Banks should be allowed to offer loans to foreign shipowners: CSBC</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's government should create an environment favorable for local
shipbuilding companies to compete with their foreign rivals, the head of the
country's largest shipbuilder urged Monday.</P>
      <P>CSBC Corporation, Taiwan Chairman Cheng Wen-lon made the appeal in an interview
with the Central News Agency on the sidelines of a ceremony celebrating the
delivery of three CSBC-built container vessels to German shipping company Peter
Dohle Schiffahrts-KG.</P>
      <P>One of the most effective steps the government could take to boost the
competitiveness of local shipbuilders would be to permit Taiwanese banks to
offer financing to potential foreign buyers, Cheng said.</P>
      <P>Insisting that CSBC can compete technologically with Japanese, Korean and
Chinese shipbuilders, Cheng said it would gain more leverage in pursuing foreign
orders if local banks were allowed to provide financing to its potential
customers.</P>
      <P>China, Japan and South Korea jointly control 90 percent of the world's total
commercial shipbuilding market, while Taiwan only has a 0.8 percent share, Cheng
said.</P>
      <P>"What we rely on in competing with foreign shipbuilders is our technical
expertise and our fine workmanship and quality, " Cheng said proudly. But the
company would do better if the government could create a business environment on
a par with the major shipbuilding countries, he said.</P>
      <P>Noting that China has done much to prop up its shipbuilding industry, Cheng said
Japan, South Korea and other powers in the industry have all offered financing
on attractive terms to help attract foreign customers for their shipbuilders.</P>
      <P>As for its delivery of the three container vessels Monday, Cheng said it was
fortunate that Peter Dohle only asked for a four-month delay in the delivery of
its ships, considering that the global container shipping industry was hard hit
by the 2008-2009 global financial crisis.</P>
      <P>One of CSBC's customers, an Israeli company, actually canceled its orders
because of the downturn, Cheng said.</P>
      <P>The German company placed orders for 12 container vessels with CSBC in 2006.
After Monday's delivery of two vessels capable of carrying 6,600 20-foot
containers and a vessel that can accommodate 4,200 20-foot containers, six more
vessels are still to be delivered.</P>
      <P>"German shippers are known to be demanding of high quality. Our technology has
helped us secure orders from Peter Dohle, " Cheng said.</P>

      <P>The Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) passed a construction
proposal to add four stations to the Taiwan high speed rail system by 2015 to
increase passengers by about 5 percent, a CEPD official said Monday.</P>
      <P>Under the plan, Nangang Station in Taipei City is scheduled to be completed in
October 2012, and Miaoli, Changhua and Yunlin stations are scheduled for June
2015, the official said.</P>
      <P>In January 2010, the daily number of passengers using the rail system averaged
93,000, with an average seat use rate of about 46 percent. After the additional
stations are completed, the passenger load is estimated to increase by 5
percent, the official added.</P>
      <P>The project would cost NT$52 million (US$1.65 million) for construction of
Miaoli, Changhua and Yunlin stations and related facilities, NT$191 million for
compensation for requisition of land and resettlement for residents of
demolished houses, and NT$289 million for construction supervision and
management. The Taiwan High Speed Rail Corp. will provide NT$7.5 billion for the
project, according to the official.</P>
      <P>He also said that in 2002 the Executive Yuan approved plans to transform the
Nangang preparatory station into an auxiliary operation station to ease traffic
jams, adding that an additional NT$1.70 billion has been earmarked for
construction of the station.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US urges China take steps to encourage Taiwan engaging in dialogues</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The United States would like to see China to take steps to make Taiwan
comfortable in engaging in cross-Taiwan Strait dialogues, U.S. Assistant
Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Kurt Campbell told the
media Monday.</P>
      <P>"We would very much like to see China to take steps and to encourage Taiwan and
to make them feel comfortable (in cross-Strait dialogues) ... We believe that
overall process of this dialogue is important, " Campbell responded to a
reporter's question in a keynote speech,  titled "American Engagement  and
Asia",  in the 2010 International Media Conference.</P>
      <P>Campbell acknowledged that there has been a security dimension in the cross-
Strait relations and said that the U.S. have urged restraint on both sides.</P>
      <P>Reviewing recent U.S.-Taiwan relations, the veteran diplomat said that one of
the biggest source of concerns in the past several years was "unintended
development" and "accidents, " but there has been an increase of confidence
since then.</P>
      <P>Campbell reiterated  that the U.S.  maintains a unofficial relationship with
Taiwan, which has been maintained by succession of administrations, and the
commitment is legally binding by the Taiwan Relations Act.</P>
      <P>"We have confidence in our broad relationship and encourage dialogues between
two sides. " he said.</P>
      <P>Asked on what role the U.S. will play under the circumstances of the warming
cross-Strait ties, Campbell did not give a direct answer but said that "I see no
concerns (from the U.S.) of a warming relationship between Taiwan and China."</P>
      <P>In terms of China, Campbell affirmed in the one-hour speech that the U.S.
maintains a stable and constructive relationship with China.</P>
      <P>However, he said that current U.S.-Sino relations are no longer a "monotone" and
"something like black and white" during the Cold War era.  The relations are now
multi-layer and more diverse and complicated, containing a wide range of factors
from currency to trade, and from Iran to North Korea, all of which make the
relations "extraordinary complex".</P>
      <P>The bilateral relations suffered certain degree of a setback during U.S.
President Barack Obama's second year in office during which China was not happy
with Obama's meeting with the Dalai Lama and the U.S. arm sales to Taiwan, he
recognized.</P>
      <P>But at the same time, the U.S. will keep up its cooperation with China on many
issues. For example, China could play a role on Korean Peninsula, he said.</P>
      <P>Campbell said that the U.S. presence in the Asia Pacific region is still strong
and maintains good relationship with its traditional allies as well as several
emerging countries, despite a widespread perception of a gradual U.S. power
decline in the region over the years.</P>
      <P>The U.S. will meet the challenge by increasing high-ranking official visits to
the region and interactive with the Asian Pacific countries regularly, he said.</P>
      <P>Almost 300 international politics experts and media members attended the three-
day "2010 International Media Conference" from April 26-28, which was organized
by the East-West Center, established by the U.S. Congress in 1960 to promote

    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairperson Tsai Ing-wen will
explain the party's stance to local and foreign media on a proposed trade pact
with China, a party task force said Monday.</P>
      <P>The DPP will also push for a referendum on the economic cooperation framework
agreement (ECFA), and assess the possibility of holding a demonstration on the
issue before mid-May, said Julian Kuo, a spokesman for the task force.</P>
      <P>Kuo said that after the high-profile debate between President Ma Ying-jeou and
the DPP's chairwoman Sunday, the party felt that the president had not addressed
or answered many questions raised by Tsai.</P>
      <P>"The DPP will help the public find the real answers through the legislature and
its campaign," Kuo said.</P>
      <P>Tsai will also meet with major local and foreign media to explain why the party
believes it would be rash to sign an agreement that it contends would leave
Taiwan too economically dependent on China.</P>
      <P>On the possibility of a referendum, the opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU)
has completed the first stage of a petition drive to hold a referendum on the
ECFA by sending 110,000 signatures to the Central Election Commission (CEC) ,
which the CEC will review in May.</P>
      <P>If a referendum screening committee finds that the petition conforms with the
Referendum Act, the DPP will push to collect the signatures needed -- about
850,000 or 5 percent of the nearly 17 million eligible votes in the last
presidential election -- in the second stage of the campaign.</P>
      <P>"The role of the DPP will be more clear and positive," Kuo said.</P>
      <P>On suggestions by some DPP members that the party stage a large-scale rally
prior to the signing of the ECFA, which the ruling Kuomintang hopes occurs in
June, Kuo said it was a question of how much momentum could be built through a
demonstration.</P>
      <P>The DPP feels the issue for which it can gain the most support is holding a
referendum on the trade pact, he said.</P>
      <P>The party expects that the "early harvest list, " which allows early tariff
concessions, will be unveiled before May 20, and the DPP will assess at that
time what kind of demonstration would be held, he said.</P>

      <P>The debate may have changed Ma's resistance to the idea of holding a referendum
on the ECFA. Although he still appears not to approve the idea, he is no longer
opposed to the movement seeking such a referendum.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, former Minister without Portfolio Chu Yun-peng praised the debate for
encouraging the leaders of ruling and opposition parties to engage in meaningful
dialogue on a significant public policy.</P>
      <P>Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>Public survey results from the pro-DPP Taiwan Thinktank show that 66 percent of
respondent thought that whether or not to sign the ECFA should be decided by
popular referendum</P>
      <P>Their analysis also found that nearly half of "pan-blue alliance" supporters
support the idea of holding the referendum. It indicates that the idea of an
ECFA referendum has crossed political party barriers to become a common opinion
of "pan-green" and "pan-blue" supporters.</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>Ma's spokesman Lo Chih-chiang cited Ma as saying that the president recognized
the debate's function, which Ma said enabled him to listen to different voices
on his ECFA policy.</P>
      <P>Amid growing public popularity thanks to the debate, President Ma planned two
meetings with foreign reporters Tuesday and Wednesday to convey his ideas on the
cross-strait trade pact to the international community.</P>
      <P>High ranking government officials and bigwigs in the ruling Kuomintang pointed
out that Ma, who deeply believes the ECFA is the road Taiwan must take, will
never accept any of the DPP's hundreds of political reasons for not signing the
pact.</P>
      <P>President Ma firmly believes he can allow people to understand the policy
through a public explanation. The Presidential Office said that efforts to
publicize the ECFA will continue. (April 27, 2010).</P>

    <HEADLINE>United Daily News: Reconsideration the only remedy for evil bill</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>04/27/10  11:52:23
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Pressured by public opinion, the Legislative Yuan decided to delay passage of a
personal data protection bill that was ready to be voted on last week, so that
sections that limit press freedom can be revised. This is the last opportunity
to remedy this evil bill.</P>
      <P>If the lawmakers don't understand what a foolish bill it is and decide to enact
it anyway, then the Executive Yuan will have no choice but to ask the
Legislature to reconsider it. That would set an embarrassing precedent in which
an administration would ask the Legislature  controlled  by the same party  to
reconsider  an ill-conceived bill.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, many lawmakers from both the ruling and opposition parties do not
understand even now what is wrong with the bill, and have to consult the
executive branch for a remedy. This highlights the reckless attitude of the
lawmakers in carrying out their job.</P>
      <P>The controversial bill made it through a legislative committee along with 16
other bills last Tuesday, with none of the lawmakers bothering to study the
ramifications of any of them. The lawmakers took pride in the idea that they
were improving the protection of personal data by endorsing this controversial
bill, without realizing they had strangled press freedom.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Justice shares the blame for crafting the bill recklessly. It
invited only one correspondent from a newspaper which is friendly to the
opposition Democratic Progressive Party to a public hearing on the bill.</P>
      <P>Worst of all, at the urging of the Taiwan Association for Human Rights at the
public hearings, it struck off an article offering the mass media exemption from
the restrictions on revealing personal data. We are astounded by the deep-rooted
hostility this human rights group has shown toward the mass media, which is
considered the fourth estate and is respected around the world.</P>
      <P>Because of the recklessness of the executive and legislative branches, the bill
not only infringes on the freedom of the press but also restricts Internet
surfers. We are not certain that, if passed, the law could prevent the leakage
of personal data from the data bank of big enterprises as is its intention, but
it will leave people who post photos of spring scream concert-goers in Facebook
open to prosecution.</P>
      <P>The lawmakers have to right the wrong they made by having the bill reconsidered.
They are not only fixing the bill but also erasing their tarnished images.

      <P>Group purchasing has become very popular among office workers in Taiwan, with
more than four-fifths of them having tried it, a survey showed Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Food products were the favorite target of group purchases, which harness the
bargaining power of groups of online shoppers to negotiate discounts with
vendors, the survey conducted by 360D Human Resources found.</P>
      <P>About 82 percent of the polled office workers said they had joined with
colleagues in group purchasing, while 67 percent said company executives had
also become involved.</P>
      <P>According to the survey, 41 percent of respondents said the e-commerce
innovation was very trendy in offices, while almost half made purchases through
group buying as often as three times a month.</P>
      <P>Apart from food products, office workers also used group buying to purchase
cosmetics, garments and accessories, according to the survey, which was
conducted between April 15 and April 22 and collected 1,019 valid responses.</P>
      <P>PayEasy, one of Taiwan's leading e-commerce retailers, said its business has
felt the growing impact of office workers shopping online, though it did not
specify whether the purchases were made by individuals or groups.</P>
      <P>The company said the peak hours for online purchases were at around 9: 30 a.m.
and 2: 30 p.m., when office workers had a moment to surf shopping Web sites
before their bosses stepped into the office.</P>
      <P>Buying volume during the peak hours was 14 times the volume seen during non-peak
periods, it said.</P>
      <P>PayEasy  expected  its online  shopping  business  to grow significantly as

      <P>Rescuers scrambling to dig out cars suspected of being buried Sunday in a
landslide on the No. 3 National Freeway have found a license plate that
corresponds to one of the vehicles said to be missing.</P>
      <P>The license plate with the number VF4988, which was found at 11: 47 p.m.
Tuesday, matches that of the Mercedes-Benz that was reported as missing on
Monday by the father of one of the car's passengers,  Kuo Wen-han, who was
headed to Keelung with his girlfriend.</P>
      <P>More than 1,000 rescue workers, manning 200 excavators and other heavy
equipment, have been working non-stop for the past two days to rescue four cars
and five people feared buried in the landslide, which covered 300 meters of the
freeway's Keelung-Sijhih section with around 200,000 cubic meters of soil and
rock.</P>
      <P>Despite persistent rain and occasional downpours, the rescuers have worked
relentlessly without a minute of rest,  said Hsu Cheng-chang, the director of
the National Freeway Bureau's Northern Region Engineering Office.</P>
      <P>As of 10 a.m. Tuesday, the workers, including 930 soldiers, had removed some
33,000 cubic meters of earth and rocks, Hsu said.</P>
      <P>The Freeway Bureau's command center has four life-detecting systems at the
scene, hoping to detect spots where people buried under the rubble might have
survived against the odds.</P>
      <P>As of 11 a.m., no people or vehicles had been discovered, in the worst landslide
ever on a freeway in Taiwan, Hsu said.</P>
      <P>Lin Chao-tsung, director of the Central Geological Survey under the Ministry of
Economic Affairs, attributed the landslide to damaged rock anchors in the
restraining walls along the freeway.</P>
      <P>Faulty construction or wear on the anchors may have precipitated the collapse of
a hill hovering over the freeway's Keelung-Sijhih section, Lin said.</P>
      <P>The side of the hill facing the freeway was a dip slope -- a geological
formation particularly  vulnerable to landslides -- composed largely of
sandstone, Lin said.</P>
      <P>An investigation into the incident has been launched.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Two more cases of indigenous dengue fever have been reported in the southern
city of Kaohsiung, bringing to five the total number of such cases recorded
since the start of the dengue epidemic season in March, the Centers for Disease
Control (CDC) said Monday.</P>
      <P>The latest cases, reported within a week, were classified as a cluster infection
involving two people who live 15 meters away from each other in the city's
Lingya district,  according  to CDC Director-General Ling Ting.</P>
      <P>The three previous cases also occurred in the port city.</P>
      <P>Lin said this year's dengue fever epidemic pattern is similar to that of 2002 in
that the season started early, which raises concerns that the outbreak this year
could be as bad as it was in 2002.</P>
      <P>In 2002, a total of 5,336 cases of indigenous dengue fever were recorded. The
number included 241 cases of hemorrhagic fever, a potentially fatal development
of the mosquito-borne disease, and 21 deaths.</P>
      <P>This year's epidemic season began in the 11th week -- three weeks earlier than
in 2002, Lin noted. The interval between the start of the 2010 epidemic season
and the end of the 2009 epidemic season was four weeks, which was two weeks
shorter than that between 2002 and 2001, he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Commercial Times: China should concede to Taiwan on vital interests</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>04/27/10  14:01:51
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>With a debate on the planned economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA)
with China having drawn a positive reaction from Taiwan's people, the pact with
China is almost certain to be wrapped up by the middle of this year.</P>
      <P>But many local businessmen are concerned about whether their industries will be
listed among the first group of businesses to enjoy lower tariffs under the
pact, and what Beijing's promise of making concessions to Taiwan means.</P>
      <P>Ever since Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao promised  to "yield benefits" to Taiwan
under the ECFA, many local businessmen have believed that the ECFA would give
Taiwan's economy a shot in the arm.</P>
      <P>And many people came around to supporting the pact because of Wen's promise.
That belief was only natural given that China's economy is much bigger than
Taiwan's, and that it would sweeten the pot to attract  Taiwan to joining  it in
long-term  economic cooperation.</P>
      <P>Those people also believed that Wen could not back down on his promise in order
to win over Taiwan's people for political purposes.</P>
      <P>However, Beijing's promise seemed to be empty words during the most recent round
of bilateral negotiations. Many sectors Taiwan hoped would be included in the
"early harvest list" -- such as petrochemicals, machinery, flat panel, and
automobile and components -- were rejected or scaled down by Beijing.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, China's list of industries to be granted low tariffs was
longer than Taiwan's. Many of the sectors covered would surely price out their
Taiwanese competitors.</P>
      <P>Why didn't China honor its promise of concessions? Probably because it conceives
concessions differently from Taiwan. It thought that not pressing Taiwan to open
its market wider to Chinese agricultural  products  and allowing in Chinese
workers was a concession. Or it may be that China's many state-run business were
reluctant to make concessions to their Taiwanese counterparts.</P>
      <P>If that is the truth, then the differences between Beijing and Taipei are major,
because not opening Taiwan's market to Chinese laborers or more widely open it
to agricultural products are considered by Taiwan to be preconditions to any
ECFA rather than topics for negotiation.</P>
      <P>Anyway, we hope the Chinese authorities will redefine their promise of
concessions to accommodate Taiwanese businessmen, and make concessions on vital
interests to facilitate cooperation across the Taiwan Strait. China's
concessions will not only earn credit for their leader but also be compensated
for by the fruits of bilateral cooperation in the future. (April 27, 21010)</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan expressed concern Tuesday over a Japanese plan to explore seabed
resources around a disputed island group in the East China Sea.</P>
      <P>Chen Tiao-ho, secretary-general of the East Asia Relations Commission, said
Taiwan's representative office in Japan has voiced concern about the likelihood
that Japan will explore the resources, including rare metals, in waters around
the Diaoyutai Islands, known in Japan as the Senkaku Islands.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's move came after Japan's Kyodo News Agency disclosed a day earlier a
Japanese official document detailing the country's strategy to ensure undersea
resources and energy through seabed exploration in its sovereign waters,
including part of the East China Sea.</P>
      <P>Taiwan, Japan and China all claim sovereignty over the island group, which
offers the possibility of plentiful oil reserves under the continental shelf
below the islands. Relations among the three become strained whenever disputes
over the islands arise.</P>
      <P>Chen said Taiwan will watch closely how the exploration plan develops and will
employ necessary measures at an appropriate time to protect its interests.</P>
      <P>He added that as Taiwan has never changed its stance on the Diaoyutai Islands
sovereignty, while Japan still insists on its own viewpoint, the two sides
should put aside the sovereignty issue and work together on marine resource
exploration.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) announced Tuesday that it will push a
policy of establishing offshore wind power plants and propose incentives in July
to encourage local firms to invest in offshore wind power generation.</P>
      <P>Deputy Minister of Economic Affairs Huang Chung-chiou said it is not too late
for Taiwan to develop offshore wind generation, citing Denmark, the U.K, and
Holland, which are still in the initial stages of developing the energy
resource.</P>
      <P>"Offshore wind generation should be given top priority, " Huang said, adding
that the Taiwan Strait has very good locations for developing offshore wind
power generation.</P>
      <P>The capacity of a wind power generation station located within 20 meters off the
coast could reach 1,200 megawatts (MW) , which is larger than the capacity of a
similar wind power plant on land, Huang said.</P>
      <P>If the plant is set up around 20 meters to 50 meters off the coast, its capacity
could increase to 5,000 MW -- almost equal to the combined capacity of two
nuclear power plants, according to Huang.</P>
      <P>Yeh Hui-chin, chief of the Bureau of Energy under the MOEA said that offshore
areas near central Taiwan's Changhua and Yunlin counties are suitable sites for
developing wind power generation, and the MOEA will propose a plan in July to
specify wind farm areas and the capacity needed.</P>
      <P>According to the MOEA, the production value of Taiwan's wind power generation
equipment was NT$4 billion (US$128 million) in 2009, with investment from 20
companies. The value of investment is expected to increase by more than NT$1.5
billion per year from 2010.</P>
      <P>Huang pointed out that the Teco Group, Formosa Heavy Industries Corp., Yuan Jun
Fong, and Taiwan's China Steel are aggressively taking part in developing the
wind power industry.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Hon Hai Group, the world's biggest contract electronics manufacturer, was
named Tuesday as the preferred bidder for a build-operate-transfer (BOT)
contract to build an information park next to Guang Hua Digital Plaza in Taipei
City.</P>
      <P>Hon Hai's distribution subsidiary, Cybermart Worldwide Co., beat out four other
companies, including Clevo Co., which was named the alternate bidder, and Lemel,
Taiwan's leading information product distributor, to gain the upper hand in
clinching the project.</P>
      <P>Taipei's Department of Finance said it chose Cybermart Worldwide because of its
proposal that stressed Taipei could not be left out of the global technology
network, and because of the backing provided by the Hon Hai Group's deep
resources.</P>
      <P>The operator of the BOT project will have the right to operate the park for 50
years.</P>
      <P>The planned complex, to be situated on a 2,686-ping lot (8,864 square meters) ,
is expected to include a 3C shopping mall, brand product shop, and multi-
functional exhibition hall.</P>
      <P>Other planned facilities in the park, expected to be opened in March 2014,
include a state-of-the-art technology exhibition center, digital entertainment
zone, and business cultivation center.</P>
      <P>Hon Hai Chairman Terry Gou also promised to set up a NT$200 million  fund to
encourage  young  people  to participate  in international information design
contests and promote cooperation between Taiwan's universities and their foreign
counterparts, the department added.</P>
      <P>The city expects the BOT project will draw NT$3.7 billion in private investment
and create 1,500 new jobs in the next few years, while contributing an estimated
NT$7 billion in sales and income tax revenues to central government coffers
during the 50-year concession period.</P>
      <P>The BOT project is the second-phase of the local government's ambitious plan to
build an "Akihabara electric town" in the capital city. Akihabara is an area of
Toyko that is known for 3C electronics, animation, manga and video games.</P>
      <P>Commenting on his company's runner-up finish, Clevo Chairman Kent Hsu said he
was very disappointed.</P>
      <P>After successfully opening the Buynow shopping mall chain in China, which
retails 3C information-related products, Hsu said he wanted to use their know-
how to build a successful shopping center along the same lines in Taiwan.</P>

Mother's Day.</P>
      <P>Among the 600 respondents aged between 20 and 40, 96 percent said they regard
their mothers as very important. However, 48.66 percent said they rarely hug
their mothers, while 25.5 percent said they do so only when their mothers are
ill.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted by TC Reading, a Taichung-based civic group that
promotes reading.</P>
      <P>The results were released at a news conference held by the city's Department of
Social Affairs to promote a Mother's Day event scheduled for this Sunday aimed
at encouraging people to hug their mothers to show their gratitude.</P>
      <P>Sharing his own experience of interacting with his parents-in-law and two
daughters, Chang Kuo-hui, director of the department, said that for most
parents, receiving a hug or a phone call from their children is all they want.</P>
      <P>A group of kindergarten kids also attended the news conference to tell how they
see their own mothers, with some describing her as a magician conjuring up
delicious meals or working around the clock like a convenience store. Others
likened their mothers to a whipping top and an alarm clock.</P>

      <P>A shipment of frozen pork ribs imported from the United States was destroyed
after it was found to contain the banned substance ractopamine, a drug put in
feed to make pigs raised for meat leaner.</P>
      <P>The Keelung Customs Office said the 1,360-kilogram shipment of pork ribs was
brokered through customs on March 29. The importer decided not to return the
pork ribs to the shipper, because the value of the shipment,  NT$47,790
(US$1,520) ,  was lower than the transportation costs US$2,000.</P>
      <P>Opposition  Democratic  Progressive  Party  legislators  Liu Chien-kuo, Huang
Jen-shu and Chen Ying, along with officials from the Bureau of Animal and Plant
Health Inspection and Quarantine, Bureau of Standards, Metrology and Inspection,
and customs, were on hand to see the pork ribs taken out of their container and
destroyed in an incinerator.</P>
      <P>Chen said the frozen pork ribs were found to have contained 1.18 ppb of
ractopamine, an additive allowed by only five countries and banned by Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Liu said that recently, a customs official was found to have collaborated with a
trading company in Taipei City to allow in frozen Matsuzaka beef from Japan,
which has been barred from entering Taiwan since 2001 after Japan reported an
outbreak of mad cow disease.</P>
      <P>Because of such examples of customs corruption, Liu and Chen said that they will
propose in the legislature that in the future, the process of destroying any
seized commodities should be recorded for monitoring purposes.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>U.S. Representative David Wu said Monday that he supports the idea of inviting
Republic of China President Ma Ying-jeou to attend the annual meeting of the
Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum this year.</P>
      <P>At a tea party he hosted for correspondents of Chinese-language media in
Washington, D.C., Wu said it would be a good idea to have U.S. President Barack
Obama invite Ma to an unofficial summit of APEC leaders that the U.S. president
will host in Hawaii later this year.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's president has been blocked from the summit due to China's opposition
ever since it was admitted to the forum in 1991. Taiwan usually sends a senior
economic official instead.</P>
      <P>Wu said the U.S. should cancel a self-imposed ban on visits to Washington by
Taiwan's president.</P>
      <P>Recalling that he took a five-hour flight from Washington to San Francisco in
January for a 90-minute meeting with Ma, Wu said he "cannot understand" why it
is so difficult to meet with the ROC president in the United States.</P>
      <P>Ma arrived in San Francisco Jan. 26 on a transit stop en route to a visit to
Honduras.</P>
      <P>With regard to Taiwan's negotiations with China on a trade pact, Wu, who is
originally from Taiwan, said it is good for Taiwan and China to promote
bilateral exchanges.</P>
      <P>He also lauded Ma's push for reconciliation with China, saying the president is
moving at an appropriate pace.</P>
      <P>However, he said the prospects for Taiwan clinching a free trade pact with the
U.S. for the time being are dim. He did not elaborate.</P>
      <P>He also said it is inevitable that the Chinese yuan will appreciate, but
predicted that it will be a gradual process, so that both U.S. consumers and
Chinese producers will be able to adapt to the situation.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan not economically over-dependent on China: president</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   April  27  (CNA)
04/27/10  17:49:40
(By Alex Jiang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou on Tuesday dismissed concerns that Taiwan might become
too dependent on China economically, after the signing of a controversial trade
pact with China.</P>
      <P>"I will call that (Taiwan-China trade) mutual or interdependent, " Ma said when
fielding a question from an audience of Taipei-based foreign reporters at a
meeting in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's exports to China and Hong Kong in March reached an all-time high of
US$10.26 billion, the highest amount in a single month ever. Taiwan's exports to
the mainland and Hong Kong hit US$26.42 billion in the first quarter of this
year, accounting for a record 42.8 percent of its total exports.</P>
      <P>It's "because that more than 40 percent of our exports go to the mainland, we
need a mechanism to administrate and to do something about this large volume of
trade to make sure that will actually increase the benefits to Taiwan," Ma said.</P>
      <P>In addition, Ma said that the signing of the trade liberalization agreement with
China is not the first step toward unification with China, but a step toward
helping Taiwan regain a prominent place in world trade and in East Asia,
especially as a springboard for foreign investment in the region.</P>
      <P>"We can handle diplomatic isolation, but economic isolation is fatal," Ma said.</P>
      <P>He said Taiwan will move quickly to sign free-trade agreements with other
countries, including Singapore and the United States, once it signs the
agreement with China, and urged China not to bar Taiwan from signing such deals
with its other trade partners.</P>
      <P>"I demand mainland China not to obstruct our efforts to sign FTAs with major
trading partners of Taiwan," Ma said.</P>
      <P>However, Ma did not specify which country will be the first of his efforts to
help Taiwan reach FTAs or the number of FTAs he expects to reach after inking
the proposed economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) with China,
possibly in June.</P>
      <P>"We cannot say, at the moment, how many but certainly we will try our best. And
we hope we could do it right after we have our ECFA passed by our Legislative
Yuan (Taiwan's legislature)," Ma said.</P>
      <P>"And then we will formalize our action to do that. So we hope as soon as
possible," Ma said.</P>
      <P>During a debate with opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairwoman
Tsai Ing-wen days earlier, Ma said that he will lead a task force in signing
FTAs with Taiwan's major trading partners to diversify the country's export
markets.</P>
      <P>China is now Taiwan's largest trade partner and export market. Besides the
United States and Singapore, the European Union countries and Japan are said to
be on Taiwan's future FTA list.</P>
      <P>Ma,  who is seen as more friendly toward China than his predecessor, Chen Shui-
bian, also told the reporters that other countries had advised Taiwan to first
sign an FTA with China, in order to reach deals with other countries, which
Beijing had objected to.</P>
      <P>"When we tried to approach other countries, well, it's a rejection everywhere, "
he noted. "Many countries told us that if you want to have an FTA with us, well,
maybe you should try mainland China first."</P>
      <P>Questioned how he can prevent deeper economic reliance on China from eroding
Taiwan's cherished democratic way of life, Ma expressed confidence  and urged
his audience to have faith in Taiwan's democracy.</P>
      <P>"There are things that Taiwan can do to really strengthen our democracy and
really solidify our sovereignty. I think our press freedom and other things will
help... So I keep telling people you have to trust Taiwan's people and Taiwan's
democracy. I think that will have a very very important power in making Taiwan
free and democratic," Ma said.</P>
      <P>He also stressed that Taiwan's pact with China will be different from that
between Hong Kong and China as the ECFA text will not carry any political
language, including "one China" or "one country, two systems, " which would
downgrade Taiwan's sovereignty.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC) is set to commission a
task force within three days to explore the cause of a Sunday landslide that
buried part of the No. 3 Freeway, including five people in four cars that were
trapped under the rubble.</P>
      <P>Chen Yen-po, deputy director of the MOTC's Department of Railways and Highways,
said the team, to be made up of geological experts, will be tasked with finding
out the cause of the disaster, the worst that has occurred on a national highway
because of slope failure.</P>
      <P>In addition, Chen said, the team will also conduct a detailed investigation into
the design of the freeway in northern Taiwan, which is built along a dip slope.</P>
      <P>Some academics have suggested that damaged rock anchors might be behind the
landslide and warned that 32 dip slopes along the nation's freeways are
potentially at risk.</P>
      <P>In response to grave public concern that more landslides might take place in
these disaster-prone areas, the MOTC's National Freeway Bureau said it will
conduct an overall probe of all the dip slopes along the country's freeways
within three days to check whether any of them are in dangerous shape.</P>
      <P>Later that same day, the Taipei City Geotechnical Engineering Office urged
residents living in houses near slopeland not to worry about their safety, as no
signs of insecurity around their homes have been discovered in the wake of
several days of rain.</P>
      <P>According to Huang Lee-yuan, the office's chief engineer, 135 apartment
complexes under the office's jurisdiction are built near side slopes.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a news conference, Huang said the city government is considering
installing free monitoring systems in these residential communities to help
prevent disasters related to slope failures, so that the office can demand that
the communities' management swiftly handles insecure situations if any problems
are detected.</P>
      <P>There are more than 20,000 artificial side slopes in Taipei City, according to
the most recent investigation conducted April 1.</P>

      <P>Mexico will soon relax its visa requirements for Taiwan citizens in an effort to
attract larger numbers of Taiwanese visitors, a Mexico envoy in Taiwan said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Martin Munoz Ledo Villegas, head of the Mexican Trade Services Documentation and
Cultural Office in Taiwan, said that his office will implement simple and
convenient procedures for Taiwan citizens to visit Mexico and will make a more
detailed announcement on the matter this weekend.</P>
      <P>The new policy is expected to take effect in May, according to Munoz Ledo.</P>
      <P>"We have a long history, beautiful views, good food and rich culture, which make
us an ideal country for people to visit for tourism," he said.</P>
      <P>Statistics from the office show that in recent years, the number of Taiwanese
tourists to Mexico has increased greatly, propelling Taiwan into second place
after India in terms of Mexico's tourism sources in Asia, he said.</P>
      <P>"In 2006, my office issued about 4,000 visas, of which business visas accounted
for approximately 85 percent to 90 percent, " Munoz Ledo said. "But in 2009, we
issued 6,000 visas, with business visas dropping to 60 percent of the total and
the remainder being tourist visas."</P>
      <P>Munoz Ledo said that he was encouraged by these numbers and has set a goal this
year to persuade more Taiwanese people to go to Mexico.</P>
      <P>"I hope that the number from Taiwan will surpass the number from India, " he
said.</P>
      <P>As part of Mundo Ledo's plan, an art gallery has been set up in the waiting area
of the consulate section of his office and he has held many activities in Taiwan

      <P>Three people were honored in Taichung City Tuesday for making the highest number
of blood donations in the central Taiwan area.</P>
      <P>Liu Cheng-ting, 57, who was given an award for the most whole blood donations --
a total of 210, said that in his experience blood donations not only save lives
but can also help the donor to maintain good health.</P>
      <P>Lu vowed that as long as his health permits, he will continue to be a blood
donor.</P>
      <P>Blood donation "is a worthy lifetime cause, " he added.</P>
      <P>Liu's sentiments were echoed by Tsai Min-yu and Tsai Fang-ching, the top male
and female donors, respectively, in the category of plateletpheresis.</P>
      <P>The pair, both in their 40s, pledged to continue to donate blood and teach
children the advantages of this action.</P>
      <P>Tsai Min-yu has recorded nearly 1,000 plateletpheresis blood donations, and Tsai
Fang-ching about 800.</P>
      <P>The process of donating whole blood is relatively quick but such donations can
only be made by an individual at three-month intervals, at the minimum,
according to the Taichung Blood Donation Center.</P>
      <P>The plateletpheresis donation process, in which only platelets are acquired,
takes a longer time but individuals can make such donations every two weeks, the

    <TEXT>
      <P>A package of amendments to the Personal Data Protection Act were passed into law
Tuesday after concerns over its potential restrictions on press freedom were
smoothed out.</P>
      <P>Before the amendments cleared the legislative floor, ruling and opposition
lawmakers reached a consensus on exempting mass media from the legislation's
requirement that the consent of an individual has to be obtained before personal
information about that person is released publicly.</P>
      <P>Based on the principle of protecting public interests, mass media outlets will
now be allowed by the amendments to obtain personal information on parties
involved in news reports without obtaining their consent in advance, according
to the newly enacted law.</P>
      <P>Legislators, however, were not exempted from the stipulation.</P>
      <P>Controversy has brewed over the bill since last week after the Legislature's
Organic Laws and Statutes Committee decided to remove a clause in the amendments
that would have exempted the media from the consent requirement.</P>
      <P>The passage of the law comes after the Presidential Office issued a statement on
April 22 that said freedom of the press is not only a constitutionally protected
basic human right but also the bedrock of democracy.</P>
      <P>It stressed that President Ma Ying-jeou is adamant that press freedom should be
protected.</P>
      <P>The newly enacted law also excludes personal blogs from the consent requirement.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Chin Cheng-hsiang, director of the Ministry of Justice's
Department of Legal Affairs, said bloggers will be dealt with under the Civil
Code if their posts damage others' reputations or use their personal pictures
without obtaining prior consent.</P>
      <P>As there has been controversy over the definition of "public interests, " a sub-
resolution was also passed Tuesday, demanding that the Executive Yuan engage in
further discussion with experts and civic groups on the definition of "public

      <P>The proposed economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) between Taiwan and
China is a "lean and necessary" trade deal for Taiwan rather than a fully
fledged free trade agreement (FTA), Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairwoman
Lai Shin-yuan said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>In an interview with a local radio station, Lai said the Taiwan-China ECFA is
"special economic deal" in line with the spirit of the World Trade Organization
(WTO) , of which both sides are members.</P>
      <P>Lai lamented that the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has
misconstrued the ECFA as an FTA and has claimed that Taiwan will be obliged to
open its market fully to China within 10 years of signing.</P>
      <P>As a matter of fact, Lai went on, the WTO has never asked any signatories of the
272 FTAs that exist around the world to complete mutual market opening within a
period of 10 years, adding that marketing openings among some FTA partners have
even been less than 50 percent.</P>
      <P>In addition, the WTO is unlikely to punish FTA partners whose market opening
lags behind schedule, she added.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou's administration hopes that the ECFA can be signed in
June as a means of sharpening Taiwan's international competitiveness, but has
met strong opposition from the DPP, which is concerned  that it will make Taiwan
over-dependent  on China economically and result in a massive influx of Chinese
farm goods and laborers.</P>
      <P>Lai said that in its ECFA talks with China, government will uphold the principle
that there will be no all-out market opening under the trade deal.</P>

      <P>Dubbed by Business magazine as "the most dangerous woman in China," prominent
Chinese journalist Hu Shuli told the international media Tuesday that she is
back in Chinese media circles and hopes, through a new venture, to achieve the
goal of independent news reporting in China.</P>
      <P>Less than six months Hu left "Caijing, " an influential and profitable business
magazine founded by her in China in 1998, she has established "Caixin Media."</P>
      <P>The new enterprise  will be as "outspoken,  critical  and professional" as
before, she told around 300 media workers and international politics experts in
a keynote speech at the 2010 International Media Conference organized by the
U.S. East-West Center.</P>
      <P>"Our future should be in our own hands, " said Hu, 56, who was forced to resign
from Caijing last fall amid government anger over the magazine's exposure of a
series of scandals in China's stock market  and its criticism  of the Chinese
administration  as incompetent.</P>
      <P>Her insistence on holding the authorities accountable and on sticking to
recognized journalistic standards was supported by almost 200 journalists and
employees at Caijing who resigned when she did.</P>
      <P>With the establishment of Caixin Media, Hu said, she now envisions a bigger
future.</P>
      <P>"Political influence and commercial interests should and will be kept out of
Caixin Media," she stressed.</P>
      <P>The enterprise publishes two Chinese-language magazines, Century Weekly and
China Reform, as well as the English-language Caixin Digest.</P>
      <P>It also hosts a Web site (www.caing.com) and offers mobile content and
electronic magazine subscriptions. It links to online social networks such as
Facebook and Twitter for better communication with its readers, according to Hu.</P>
      <P>In an era when the media world has changed because of TV, the Internet and
mobile devices, Hu said, she is seeking to pursue independent journalism in
China via a multimedia platform.</P>
      <P>She said that although the traditional media in China, especially newspapers and
magazines, is still on the rise, she has decided that her new business should
take on the bigger challenge of competing with well-known international media.</P>
      <P>"I hope we can find a new business model to catch up with the times before it's
too late, " she said.</P>
      <P>Asked about her relationship with the Chinese government, Hu described it as "up
and down, back and forth." However, she has not given up hope, she said.</P>
      <P>She noted that among China's 400 million Internet users, 80 percent of them
listed reading news as their favorite online activity as opposed to 20 percent
in the Western world.</P>
      <P>"All we need to do is grasp the opportunities and never give up," she said. "I
don't worry much about difficulties. I always prefer to look for opportunities."</P>
      <P>Responded to reporters' questions on tight governmental control of the Chinese
media, Hu said she doesn't think the media in China is still an instrument of
the state.</P>
      <P>The Chinese media is now more diversified, especially in the Internet-dominated
news market, she said.</P>
      <P>"You cannot say there is only one voice (in China), " she added.</P>
      <P>Hu's choice of career was in the footsteps of her mother who was a senior editor
at Workers' Daily in China. Her father worked in a trade union.</P>
      <P>She was awarded the 2003 International Editor of the Year by the World Press
Review, and the 2007 Louis Lyons Award for Conscience and Integrity in
Journalism  by the Nieman Foundation  at Harvard University. In May 2008, the
U.S. magazine Foreign Policy named her as one of the top 100 public
intellectuals in the world.</P>

      <P>He noted that foreign investors used to complain about Taiwan not doing enough
in terms of intellectual  property  rights (IPR) protection, but with Taiwan
putting more efforts into R&amp;D, design, marketing and branding over the
years, it has turned the tables and is now asking other nations to provide IPR
protection for Taiwanese products.</P>
      <P>He noted that Taiwan has specifically  asked to have IPR protection clauses
included in the proposed cross-strait economic cooperation framework agreement

the local job market.</P>
      <P>"Although the economy is steadily picking up, we still need some time to judge
whether the employment market has improved, " Hu said, adding that
"manufacturing, exports and private-sector investment have regained momentum,
but no substantial improvements have been observed in the job market."</P>
      <P>According to CEPD statistics, the combined amount of every private  investment
project  worth over NT$50 million in the January-February period totaled
NT$291.1 billion (US$9.3 billion) , accounting for 28 percent of the full-year
target set by the government. The ratio was the highest on record for the first
two months of the year.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the March industrial production index set a fresh new high of 120.3,
an increase of 39.2 percent year on year, while the value of March export orders
also recorded a historic single-month high of US$34.39 billion.</P>
      <P>"These are signs that Taiwan's macro-economy  has advanced strongly," Hu
explained.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the economy flashed a red light for March, according to the five-
color monitoring system for the country's economic performance, the CEPD
announced earlier the same day. The March composite score stood at 39 points, up
one point from February.</P>
      <P>The council said improvements among consumer, wholesale, retail and
restaurant/beverage indicators were the primary reason for the third month of a
red light.</P>
      <P>The March leading indicator index reached 109.3 points, up by 0.3 percent over
February.</P>
      <P>Hong Ruei-bin,  director  of the CEPD's Economic  Research Department, said the
government is poised to launch more public construction works to help attract
more private-sector investment and create jobs.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan's economic prospects are optimistic, " he said.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Tuesday that Taiwan and the Philippines have
continued to cooperate in pushing for the establishment of a typhoon center
under the framework of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum.</P>
      <P>Ma noted that since National Science Council (NSC) Minister Lee Lou-chuang
visited  Manila  last  year to attend  the second Taiwan-Philippine ministerial-
level science and technology conference and both sides reached a consensus
during the meeting, bilateral exchanges have been close.</P>
      <P>He said the Philippines is planning to send eight meteorologists to Taiwan's
Central Weather Bureau to help nurture the Southeast Asian country's
meteorological talent.</P>
      <P>He also noted that NSC Deputy Minister Chen Cheng-hong led a delegation to
Manila to attend a Taiwan-Philippines forum on climate change earlier this
month.</P>
      <P>At present, the bilateral cooperation includes a feasibility assessment on
installing a meteorological radar station in the northern Philippines, in
addition to the proposed typhoon center under the APEC framework, Ma said.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that all nations attach great importance to regional cooperation
when studying climate change and that Taiwan and the Philippines, each of which
face the threat of natural disasters, should strengthen their cooperation.</P>
      <P>Ma also said the Philippines will hold a general election in two weeks, and
expressed hope that the two sides can maintain good science and technology
exchanges after the polling.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Media challenges discussed at international conference</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Media members taking part in an international conference Tuesday discussed
possible new models for the media business, which is facing enormous challenges
in the Internet age.</P>
      <P>Items such as "free vs. subscription, " the fierce competition for readership
and advertising dollars and the "rethinking of the media" were discussed by
participants in a debate titled "Sustainable Media Models in the Internet Age"
on the second day of the 2010 International Media Conference, organized by the
U.S. Congress-funded East-West Center.</P>
      <P>Joshua Benton, Director of Nieman Journalism Lab at Harvard University, noted
that it is difficult for traditional media to be profitable in an age in which
fewer people read print news.</P>
      <P>Since 2006, one-third of newsroom jobs in the U.S. have been cut, he said.</P>
      <P>While the average time spent on a news website per user averages between 2-8
minutes per month, Benton said, the same stats for the social website Facebook
is 7 hours per month.</P>
      <P>According to Benton, most news organizations lack technical expertise and their
newsrooms tend to insist on sticking with traditions, which hampers much-needed
adjustment.</P>
      <P>Benton said that a good model for increasing revenues would be to publish
newspapers only two or three times per week, charging NT$315 (US$10) per paper.
That way, he said, readers would be interested in news content because there
would be increasing segregation between printed material and web content.</P>
      <P>Thomas Crampton, a former New York Times journalist, said the emergence of
social media such as blogs, and services such as Facebook and Twitter, have
caused a structural impact, as the barrier of entry has become extremely low,
while some advertisers no longer deal with the print media at all.</P>
      <P>Charging readers does not sound like a good idea because "a lot of people will
be happy with the free alternatives, " he said.</P>
      <P>In terms of the negative impact suffered by the emergence of the Internet, the
media business is a lot like the music industry, Crampton went on.</P>
      <P>He advised the media to pay attention to the three pillars of "print, online and
in-person, " which means media companies should provide their news stories
online and in print, and should probably organize  real-life  events to create
closer bonds and better communication with readers.</P>
      <P>Reginald Chua, editor-in-chief of the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post,
said the media suffers because the revenue it receives from advertisements  and
subscriptions  and the costs of news production do not match.</P>
      <P>Chua urged the media to think hard about how to generate revenue, how to change
its way of telling stories, how the newsroom can help with reporting and how to
restructure the newsroom, which according to him has not changed much since the
1950s.</P>

      <P>To help Taiwan cope with a fast-changing global economy, the Council for
Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) has started working on a program with
the aim of creating a "golden decade" for the country, CEPD Vice Chairman Hu
Chung-ying said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>In addition to crafting an economic strategy to sharpen Taiwan's
competitiveness, the "2020 national visionary program" will outline projects for
the country's development on a broad range of fronts over the next decade, Hu
told a news conference.</P>
      <P>"The CEPD will iron out a development blueprint for the major challenges that
Taiwan is likely to encounter in the coming 10 years, ranging from an aging
society to green industry," he said.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan and China are expected to soon ink an economic cooperation  framework
agreement (ECFA)  that might lead to a fundamental change in Taiwan's economic
structure, Hu said it is vital that Taiwan explores its niche in long-term
development at a time when most countries have already begun to do so.</P>
      <P>Hu's remarks came after President Ma Ying-jeou revealed the "golden decade"
vision Sunday in a debate with opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
Chairperson Tsai Ing-wen on whether or not Taiwan should sign the ECFA with
China.</P>
      <P>In contrast to Tsai's fear that the proposed ECFA will hurt Taiwan's economy and
sovereignty, Ma said the agreement is vital to Taiwan's survival after eight
years of inaction under the DPP.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Although several countries have approached Taiwanese ace tennis player Chang
Kai-chen with a view to having her represent them in competition, her father
remained adamant Tuesday that Taiwan is still her priority choice.</P>
      <P>Chang Chin-lai said at a news conference during which his daughter signed a
sponsorship contract with a local real estate developer that Taiwan's support
for players is limited.</P>
      <P>Two years ago, other countries approached Chang, hoping that Kai-chen would play
for them, but Chang said he turned down the offers.</P>
      <P>"Two years ago, I placed Taiwan as the top priority. But the playing career of a
professional athlete is short and I and her coach will make the best choice for
her next year at the latest, " Chang said.</P>
      <P>Kai-chen signed a sponsorship contract with the real estate developer Tuesday
that will provide her with NT$1 million (US$31,741) over three years.</P>
      <P>Chang said his daughter has received only paltry government subsidies over the
years and that the NT$1 million is not sufficient to meet her expenses, pointing
out that hiring a professional coach alone costs more than NT$4 million per
year.</P>
      <P>Kai-chen, who placed 88th in the ATP rankings as of April 12, said she will
remain focused on her on-court performance and will leave other things to her
father and her coach.</P>
      <P>Asked if she will compete in the Asian Games in Guangzhou, China, at the end of
the year, she said that "I'll do my best if time permits."</P>
      <P>Kai-chen was scheduled to leave for Portugal later in the evening to play in the
Estoril Open, scheduled to take place May 1-9.</P>
      <P>Earlier this month, local outstanding golfer Yani Tseng was also reportedly
turned down an approach by a Chinese group seeking to sign a long-term
sponsorship contract with her.</P>
      <P>Tseng's father said his daughter would prefer to collaborate with Taiwanese
business groups, but regrettably, none have expressed any interest.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 28 (CNA)
04/28/10  11:45:20
(By Garfie Li and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Wednesday that a stronger international cooperation
network should be established to better protect homeland security.</P>
      <P>Addressing the opening of a two-day international seminar on homeland security,
Ma said he hoped concrete measures could be proposed through discussions at the
seminar to facilitate the establishment of a loophole-free international
security net.</P>
      <P>The issue is more pressing today because the concept of homeland security has
expanded since the 911 terrorist attacks on the United States and now covers
many non-conventional security considerations.</P>
      <P>In addition to conventional military and terrorist attacks, homeland security
also encompasses health and economic threats, such as the 2008-2009 global
financial crisis and swine flu outbreaks, Ma said.</P>
      <P>In those two cases, the international community worked together to help mitigate
their impact on various countries around the world, he noted.</P>
      <P>Stressing that Taiwan is more than willing to cooperate with other countries in
addressing public health issues, Ma said Taiwan not only actively contained the
spread of the influenza A (H1N1) virus through school closures but also produced
vaccines for a nationwide immunization campaign.</P>
      <P>To better cope with the consequences of climate change, Ma said Taiwan has
assisted the Philippines in establishing 15 automatic weather observation
stations to improve the accuracy of typhoon forecasting.</P>
      <P>In terms of more conventional security challenges, the president said, Taiwan
benefited from international cooperation in obtaining intelligence to prevent
possible security glitches during two major international sports events held in
Taiwan's two largest cities in 2009 -- the Taipei Deaflympics and the Kaohsiung
World Games.</P>
      <P>The homeland security seminar brought together scholars and experts from Taiwan
and five other countries to boost international cooperation in preventing
security incidents.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, Premier Wu Den-yih said global weather changes
have made it all the more important for each country around the world to devote
more energy and effort to ensure international peace and order as well as
protect safety of human lives and property.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan often encounters natural disasters and is active in
international trade and other international activities, Wu said Taiwan must
fulfill its obligations as a member of the international community and fully
cooperate with other peace-loving democratic countries in enhancing homeland
security.</P>

    <HEADLINE>China Times: Original survey data should be made public</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>04/28/10  12:08:14
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The results of recent surveys released by various media outlets consistently
show that most people think President Ma Ying-jeou performed better than
opposition  Democratic Progressive  Party Chairperson Tsai Ing-wen in the Sunday
debate on the proposed economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) with
China. People's awareness and support for the ECFA have also increased
significantly after the debate, according to the results.</P>
      <P>The only exception is the Liberty Times, which published figures that are
totally at odds with the other surveys.</P>
      <P>A polling organization that operates normally usually conducts more than 100
surveys a year. However, the Liberty Times "poll center" has only released the
results of three surveys over the past five years, all of which came at crucial
times, such as before an election, and contained figures that were totally
opposite to those obtained by others.</P>
      <P>We are curious about when the "poll center" was established, who its manager is
and the background of its members.</P>
      <P>We are not insinuating that the survey is fake. Our question is: Why not make
public the questionnaire? Other details that were not provided also include the
demographics of the sample, the political affiliation of the respondents and the
response rate.</P>
      <P>The best way to clear up the doubts is for the Liberty Times "poll center" to
provide the telephone numbers of the respondents and recording of the interviews
with them as well as other data files for reexamination by a neutral academic
institution. If the "poll center" did conduct the survey, it should not be
difficult at all to make public the "original data." (April 28, 2010)</P>

    <HEADLINE>United Daily News: Landslide exposes flaws in disaster prevention</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>04/28/10  12:09:01
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The landslide that occurred Sunday on the Cidu section of the No. 3 National
Freeway has seriously dented the public's confidence in the freeway system. How
could the slope have collapsed barely two months after it passed a spot check
that showed "no abnormalities"?</P>
      <P>Conducting a comprehensive inspection and strengthening the monitoring of the
freeway system is probably the only way out. We should no longer use naked-eye
observation  but should employ instruments for the purpose.</P>
      <P>A fundamental way to tackle the problem is to set up a database of sites that
constitute potential geological risks, draw a disaster prevention map, and
restrict the use of high-risk land.</P>
      <P>Just like the collapsed Siandu Mountain that buried Siaolin village during
Typhoon Morakot last August, the site of the latest landslide is a dip slope
consisting of alternating layers of sandstone and shale with particularly big
gaps in between. Rainwater making its way into those gaps could act as a
lubricant helping the slope slide down. Unfortunately, we did not learn a lesson
from the loss of more than 400 lives in Siaolin village.</P>
      <P>Many government agencies regularly survey sensitive, high-risk land.
Regrettably, the data collected have not been integrated for practical use.</P>
      <P>Only if the fundamental work is done properly will we be able to forecast,
prevent and avoid disasters. Taiwan must not continue to allow such disasters to
erode its national strength. (April 28, 2010)</P>

    <HEADLINE>Economic Daily News: Tax cut should be able to create triple wins</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>04/28/10  12:13:57
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government's proposed amendment to the income tax law is expected to clear
the legislature's floor this coming Friday. Once it is passed, the corporate
income tax rate will fall to 17 percent.</P>
      <P>Although the tax cut will lower tax revenues by an estimated NT$34.3 billion, it
is expected to boost industrial development and increase Taiwan's tax income in
the middle and long run. The ruling Kuomintang has estimated that the tax cut
will create NT$69 billion in economic benefits.</P>
      <P>There is optimism that the tax cut will end the seemingly hostile stand-off
between large and small enterprises, raise tax income in the long term and
sharpen  the competitive  edge of Taiwan's businesses. But we're skeptical the
win-win-win situation can just pop up out of nowhere. Is there a possibility the
triple wins could become a triple defeat?</P>
      <P>Could the tax cut lead to the erosion of the country's tax base, expand the gap
between rich and poor due to an imbalance in the tax system, and lower national
competitiveness because the tax change affects resource distribution and
industrial activity in a negative way?</P>
      <P>It depends on where the money that companies save thanks to the tax adjustment
will go. The best scenario is that the funds will be spent on creating
innovation, cultivating talent and increasing employment. If so, we see it as
the beginning of the win-win-win scenario.</P>
      <P>However,  we've observed  that many local enterprises  are relocating overseas
or reducing investment in Taiwan not because of high tax rates but because of
government restrictions and a bad investment environment.</P>
      <P>The government needs to put forth measures that can harness the potential
benefits the expected tax cut can generate.</P>
      <P>Taiwan faces serious problems, including high unemployment and an aging
population. The government needs to build a solid social welfare system and an
economic security mechanism for the country. Those measures are just as
important to improving the investment environment as cutting taxes. (April 28,
2010).</P>

    <HEADLINE>Research team reveals how staph infections resist antibiotics</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 28 (CNA)
04/28/10  14:31:55
(By Sunnie Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Taiwanese research team has discovered a key molecular mechanism that
contributes to antibiotic resistance in "Staphylococcus epidermidis, " a type of
staphylococcus that lives on the skin, according to Academia Sinica, Taiwan's
top research institute.</P>
      <P>Staphylococcus bacteria are notorious for quickly developing resistance  to
antibiotics  and  are  the  main  culprit  in hospital-acquired infections that
can kill patients admitted for other diseases.</P>
      <P>Among them, the staphylococcus epidermidis usually lives off skin and causes no
harm to healthy people, according to the team from Academia Sinica's Institute
of Biological Chemistry.</P>
      <P>But it can cause severe infections in immune-suppressed patients and those with
catheters or other surgical implants, said Andrew H.J. Wang, vice president of
Academia Sinica and the research team's leader.</P>
      <P>The key to understanding the mechanism described by Wang's team is that the
bacteria protects itself from the host's immune system and enhances its
resistance to antibiotics by producing a biofilm.</P>
      <P>The groundbreaking research revealed the structure of the protein component,
called Teicoplanin-Associated Locus Regulator, or TcaR, that effectively
prevents the formation of the biofilm under normal conditions.</P>
      <P>But when antibiotics are introduced, they induce the inactivation and departure
of TcaR from the DNA it would normally bind with, allowing the antibiotic-
resisting biofilm to form, according to Wang.</P>
      <P>"It is very exciting to note that our study has clearly delineated the
antibiotic binding site of TcaR and the mechanism of how antibiotics induce
biofilm formation, " Wang said.</P>
      <P>"It is expected that additional drugs will be designed and developed through the
help of structural biology."</P>
      <P>Chang Yu-ming, the study's lead writer, said future research should be targeted
at identifying or developing antibiotics that do not precipate the changes that
lead to the inactivation of TcaR.</P>
      <P>One approach, he said, was to screen existing antibiotics to see if any avoid
interacting with cells TcaR. Researchers could also develop 3D structural models
to run simulations of the biofilm formation  mechanism  that might  help lead to
more effective medications.</P>
      <P>The article "Structural Study of TcaR and its Complexes with Multiple
Antibiotics from Staphylococcus epidermidis" was published in the scientific
journal "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS)" on April 27.</P>

04/28/10  14:47:17
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Chairman Morris Chang was bullish on the semiconductor sector's growth prospects
in the near future, predicting that the global semiconductor market will grow 22
percent and the contract chip making business will grow 36 percent in 2010.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from local media coverage of the issue: Economic
Daily News:</P>
      <P>TSMC, the world's largest contract chip manufacturer by revenues, posted better-
than-expected results for the first quarter of this year, with net earnings per
share of NT$1.3, higher than the NT$1.2 forecast by foreign financial
institutions.</P>
      <P>Chang said TSMC's Q2 sales are expected to grow by 8.5-10.6 percent to a record
high of NT$100 billion to NT$102 billion, based on an exchange rate of NT$31.1
to the greenback.</P>
      <P>He further said that as global semiconductor demand in the first half of this
year is stronger than normal, growth in the second half of the year may be
slower. The global semiconductor business will remain robust for all of 2010, he
said, with growth reaching 22 percent, higher than the previous forecast of 18
percent. (April 28, 2010). China Times:</P>
      <P>TSMC's Q1 sales totaled NT$92.19 billion (US$2.94 billion) which generated anet
profit of NT$33.66 billion, or NT$1.3 per share, the highest in the past eight
quarters.</P>
      <P>Chang revealed for the first time in Tuesday's conference call that TSMC will
launch construction on its 15th wafer foundry at the Taichung Science Park in
central Taiwan later this year.</P>
      <P>According to Chang, the company's Fab15 will start with 40 nm processes but
plans to add 28nm and 20nm processes in the future.</P>
      <P>Construction on Fab15 is scheduled to start in mid-2010, Chang said, adding that
the project will help increase job opportunities in the Taichung area. (April
28, 2010). Commercial Times:</P>
      <P>Fab15, TSMC's third 12-inch wafer foundry, is expected by equipment
manufacturers to be its most advanced 28nm fab.</P>
      <P>TSMC decided to accelerate its construction of the NT$100 billion foundry
because the demand for memory chips using processes more advanced than 0.13
micron technology outpaces supply by 30 percent to 40 percent.</P>
      <P>By the end of this year, the company's 12-inch wafer fab production will
increase by 35 percent, with the volume accounting for 50 percent of its total
production. (April 28, 2010).</P>

      <P>The first group of Chinese fishing workers to be hired by Taiwanese fishing
boats under a new screening system arrived in Taiwan Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The 48 Chinese workers, the first group hired under an agreement on fishing crew
cooperation signed by Taiwan and China last December, were ferried to the
Danshuei second fishing port in northern Taiwan's Taipei County from Fujian,
southern China.</P>
      <P>Soon after the Chinese workers arrived, security inspectors from the Maritime
Patrol Directorate General under the Coast Guard Administration boarded the boat
to confirm their identities.</P>
      <P>Five of the workers got off in Danshuei and immediately underwent health exams
and had their personal documents and luggage checked.</P>
      <P>The other workers were later dropped off at the ports of Yehliu (20) and Shenao
(8) in Taipei County, Badouzih (6) in Keelung City, and Daxi (9) in Yilan
County, according to the Fisheries Agency.</P>
      <P>They had all been hired in advance by local fishing boat owners through
qualified manpower brokerage agencies.</P>
      <P>Before the agreement on fishing crew cooperation was signed late last year,
Chinese nationals working on Taiwanese fishing boats were not allowed to set
foot in Taiwan. They had to stay on fishing boats or so-called "hotels on the
sea" off the country's coast.</P>
      <P>The agreement also enables local fishing boats to better screen Chinese workers
they hire. Previously, no mechanism existed to systematically check the
identities, backgrounds, or health of the Chinese nationals they employed.</P>
      <P>Since the pact was signed on Dec. 22, 2009, 14 brokerage agencies, including the
Taiwan Provincial Fishermen's Association, were approved to introduce Chinese
fishing workers to Taiwan, the agency said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan needs to put more effort into restoring its coastal forests so that they
can serve as protection against wind and tides, the Cabinet-level Council of
Agriculture (COA) said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Chen Tsai-hui, an analyst at the COA's Taiwan Forestry Research Institute, said
that the country's coastal forests have declined substantially in recent years
because of the establishment of coastal industrial parks, fishing ports, and
recreational and wind power facilities.</P>
      <P>The western coastline is suffering serious erosion, Chen said. The overuse of
concrete armor units and bulwarks defeat the purpose of their construction,
often resulting in encroachment of the sea, he added.</P>
      <P>Land subsidence along the southwest coastline has also resulted in coastal
forests being swamped, he said.</P>
      <P>Another problem is air pollution caused by wind-blown sand in the monsoon
season, which is becoming more serious in the area near the mouths of the
Jhuoshui and Dajia rivers, he noted.</P>
      <P>In order to limit the damage from high tides and sandstorms, more forests should
be planted along Taiwan's 1,250 kilometers  of coastline, and the mangrove
forests near river mouths need to be restored, Chen advised.</P>

      <P>A massive landslide on the No. 3 National Freeway that killed at least four
people has brought home the urgency of passing a geological bill, and the ruling
Kuomintang will speed up its screening, a KMT whip said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Lin Hung-chih said that although a geological bill almost passed during the
previous legislature, lawmakers had requested the proposal be reconsidered.</P>
      <P>At the time, legislators said the bill would conflict with around 10 existing
laws, and even require farmers to submit geological safety assessments if they
want to build houses on their own farmland.</P>
      <P>But Lin said that in light of the landslide Sunday, passing the bill is a high
priority.</P>
      <P>"The Executive Yuan has submitted a new version of the geological bill, and KMT
lawmakers will speed up the screening process, " Lin said.</P>
      <P>In the wake of the tragedy, Lin also asked the government to make a thorough
assessment of dip slopes -- geological formations often created by the erosion
of tilted strata -- on national, provincial and county roads and residential
areas.</P>
      <P>Lin made the remarks at a press conference with Tsao Su-chung, chief of the
Planning Office of the Central Geological Survey under the Ministry of Economic
Affairs, attending.</P>
      <P>Tsao said that if the bill passes, the government will publish a list of
geologically sensitive regions. Development of the regions would have to pass
geologic surveys and safety assessments and then certified by the technicians.</P>
      <P>"The passing of the law will also help the government compile and manage the
geological information," he added.</P>
      <P>Tsao said that for large-scale sensitive areas, the government could install
strain measuring instruments to monitor land changes, and take preventative
measures. For small-scale sensitive areas, the government could reinforce
existing structures.</P>
      <P>But installation of the devices would have to take cost into consideration, Tsai
said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Taipei City government said that 30 out of the city's listed 135
residential communities on slopes were near dip slopes. Officials urged the
public to check the Internet for related information.</P>
      <P>The Construction and Planning Agency under the Ministry of the Interior said
there should be a law on the publication of related information, but conceded it
would trigger controversy as it would include private property.</P>
      <P>Housing brokers said that the incident might affect the prices of housing units
near slopes.</P>
      <P>On the fourth day after the landslide,  the Ministry  of Transportation and
Communications said that clearing work will continue and that aerial photos will
be posted on the Internet to help the public follow its progress.</P>
      <P>Three cars and four people were buried in the landslide, which covered 300
meters of the freeway's Keelung-Sijhih section with around 200,000 cubic meters
of soil and rock. Four bodies were dug out on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>As of noon Wednesday, 55,466 cubic meters had been cleared from the landslide
area.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Scholars discuss ECFA, arms sales in cross-Strait relations forum</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Hong  Kong,  April  28  (CNA)
04/28/10  17:10:47

    <TEXT>
      <P>Scholars from Taiwan and China recognized the positive direction in which
bilateral relations are heading but disagreed on U.S. arm sales to Taiwan, at a
forum on cross-Taiwan Strait relations in Hong Kong Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Highlighting improving relations are negotiations over a proposed economic
cooperation  framework agreement (ECFA)  that Taiwan's president, Ma Ying-jeou,
hopes to sign in June, according to the speakers.</P>
      <P>The agreement would not only represent the normalization of bilateral trade
relations but also a needed step before both sides enter a phase of political
negotiations, said Chu Shulong, deputy director of the Institute of
International Strategic and Development Studies at China's Tsinghua University.</P>
      <P>Chu and his Taiwanese counterpart Alexander Huang, a professor in Tamkang
University's Graduate Institute of International Affairs and Strategic Studies,
addressed more than 100 media members at the forum, moderated by American
Institute in Taiwan (AIT) Chairman Raymond Burghardt, on the final day of the
2010 International Media Conference, organized by the U.S. Congress-funded East-
West Center.</P>
      <P>The AIT is the U.S. representative office in Taiwan in the absence of formal
diplomatic ties. Burghardt doubles as director of East-West Seminars in the
East-West Center.</P>
      <P>Huang described the ECFA as signifying Taiwan's intention to "reconnect with the
Asia Pacific region and the ASEAN community, " Huang said.</P>
      <P>He also brushed off the concern of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party
that it would make Taiwan's economy too dependent on China, saying that "no
matter what happened, Taiwan's investment kept flowing to China over the past 20
years."</P>
      <P>While Chu said Beijing is ready to talk to Taiwan on political issues, including
confidence-building measures (CBMs) , after the signing of the ECFA, Huang said
the Ma administration is hesitant to do so because of domestic politics.</P>
      <P>The subject of U.S. arm sales to Taiwan also popped up at the forum, with Chu
saying that Beijing recognized that Taiwan had the right to possess and seek to
procure weapons from other contries, but that countries like the U.S. or Japan
have no right to sell weapons to Taiwan because Taiwan is a part of China.</P>
      <P>Taipei has defended its purchases of weapons because of Beijing's threat to use
force against Taiwan, backed by a heavy military build-up that includes more
than 1,000 missiles targeted across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Ma has said that any negotiations on a cross-strait peace pact could not begin
until Beijing had removed or dismantled the missiles.</P>
      <P>According  to Chu,  China needs to maintain  its military deployment, including
the missiles, to prevent against a worst-case scenario.</P>
      <P>He said Beijing continues to monitor Taiwan's independence movement, a sentiment
it believes still enjoys strong support in Taiwan, and remains prepared for the
possibility that the DPP will return to power.</P>
      <P>Also, better cross-strait ties have not led to a fall in U.S. arms sales to
Taiwan, Chu noted. The Obama administration still approved the sale of a US$6.5
billion package of weapons to Taiwan in January, a fact that Chu said was
difficult for China to accept.</P>
      <P>Huang responded that the U.S. is the only country that provides Taiwan the
weapons it needs, and Taiwan does not challenge China's military deterrence or
posture across the Strait with its weapons procurement and would not attack
China.</P>
      <P>Burghardt  pointed  out  the  paradox  of  the  triangular U.S.-Taiwan-China
relationship,  which he said the U.S.  side "basically wrestles with every day."</P>
      <P>Any Taiwan government, he said, wants clear U.S. public support before dealing
with China, which was why issues like arm sales, extradition, avoidance of
double taxation, and visits by Cabinet members have been important to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>That helps Taiwan's president show Taiwan's people that he is not ignoring the
U.S. as he tries to improve cross-Strait ties, he said.</P>
      <P>China, however, constantly objects to U.S. moves that show its support for
Taiwan even though the U.S. has warned that cross-Strait relations would
possibly grind to a halt if China failed to realize the mindset.</P>
      <P>Huang said most Taiwanese people do not oppose better economic relations with
China, as almost one-tenth of Taiwan's population live in China to do business.
And they want an elected government that is able to manage or nurture better
cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>What Taiwanese people need in cross-strait exchanges, Huang said, is a strategic
reassurance that there will be no war, and they want to preserve their
democratic system so their future generations can enjoy basic freedoms and
choose their lifestyles, while also being able to elect their president once
every four years.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Wednesday that signing a proposed economic
cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) with China will promote peace between the
two sides.</P>
      <P>Ma cited a report by a London-based economic policy institute as saying that the
best way for two rivals to ease hostility is to initiate a free trade agreement
(FTA), raising the costs if they opt to enter war after the pact is signed.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks at a tea party celebrating the 100th birthday of former
Republic of China Ambassador to Malawi Chao Chin-yung at the Taipei Guest House.</P>
      <P>Ma also expressed his respect for Chao, who worked at the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs between 1939 and 1984 and still serves as a foreign affairs adviser.</P>
      <P>While praising Chao for his contribution to the country, Ma said that few people
understand the pressure and hardship that Taiwan's diplomats encounter.</P>
      <P>Ma said  that  he has been striving  to expand  Taiwan's international space and
enhance ties with countries by improving cross-Taiwan Strait relations.</P>
      <P>Although some see danger in the detente with China, Ma said he believes the
policy is going in the right direction because it seeks to resolve the problem
at its root.</P>
      <P>He said that the United States, Japan, Europe, New Zealand, and Australia have
become more at ease about improving ties with Taiwan due to an improvement in
cross-strait relations over the past two years.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's promotion of economic and trade exchanges, as well as humanitarian and
cultural diplomacy with other countries, has drawn attention from the
international community that could better protect its safety and interests, Ma
added.</P>
      <P>As a result of government efforts, local companies received procurement orders
worth about US$50 million last year after Taiwan became the 41st member of the

    <HEADLINE>Endangered Taiwan sassafras trees found in unexpected location</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Researchers found a sizable group of endangered Taiwan sassafras trees in
central Taiwan for the first time last month, an unexpected surprise that
prompted the Forestry Bureau to decide to preserve their genes and try to
cultivate them in the future.</P>
      <P>The group of trees was found by forest bureau inspectors while they were doing a
field survey in the Danda mountain area in Sinyi Township of central Taiwan's
Nantou County, the bureau's Nantou office said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Tseng Yen-hsieh, an assistant professor at the Department of Forestry of
National Chung Hsing University, who was commissioned to verify the finding in
Danda, said there are over 20 trees in the group, measuring 20 to 30 centimeters
in diameter.</P>
      <P>It was the second biggest group of the endemic species, listed by the
International Union for Conservation of Nature as endangered, ever to be found
in Taiwan and the first to be discovered in the central part of the country.</P>
      <P>The only bigger population group of the species has been found in Sheipa
National Park, which straddles Miaoli and Hualien counties in northern and
eastern Taiwan, according to Liu Fu-sheng, the director of the bureau's Nantou
office.</P>
      <P>Tseng said he advised the bureau to preserve the trees' seeds for regeneration
after observing that they had developed a healthy population.</P>
      <P>Taiwan sassafras (Sassafras randaiense) is native to Taiwan but rarely observed
now in the wild, Tseng said. He noted that the plant plays a vital ecological
role in Taiwan because it is the sole food source for caterpillars of the
endangered broad-tailed swallowtail butterfly (Agehana maraho).</P>
      <P>Once the plant dies off, it will lead to the extinction of the butterfly, which
is also endemic to Taiwan, Tseng said.</P>
      <P>According to the Nantou forestry office, sassafras grew widely around the globe
before the Ice Age, when it nearly went extinct. Now only three kinds of the
species exist in the world -- the one in Taiwan, one native to eastern North
America and one native to China.</P>
      <P>Taiwan sassafras has existed on the island for 1.8 million years, and the
office's Liu said that from the viewpoint of conservation, it must urgently be
protected and researched.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Some 47 percent of Taiwanese firms are willing to hire university and college
graduates from China or Hong Kong, a recent survey found.</P>
      <P>Chinese university graduates have good communication and foreign language skills
as well as international vision, Taiwanese companies that have employed Chinese
graduates told the 104 Job Bank, which conducted the survey March 8-19.</P>
      <P>Although  graduates  in Taiwan and China possess different qualifications,  Fang
Kuang-wei, 104 Job Bank public relations manager, said Taiwanese college
students remain competitive in the local job market, as local university
graduates are strong in professional  expertise,  respect  team work and follow
ethic principles.</P>
      <P>Citing the results of previous polls, Fang said the overall competitiveness of
Taiwanese graduates is 1.86 times better than that of their Chinese
counterparts.</P>
      <P>Vickey Chen, chief of human resources at Standard Chartered Bank, said that
Taiwan acts as a "talent bank" in Asia, exporting high-end power to China and
the rest of the region.</P>
      <P>Chen praised Chinese graduates as more ambitious and braver than their Taiwanese
peers. "This is something which enterprises appraise very much when they need
personnel to explore new markets," she said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  graduates  from National Cheng Kung University, National Taiwan
University and Tamkang University are the most popular among local businesses,
the survey found. Graduates from Feng Chia University and Fujen Catholic
University ranked in the fourth and fifth spots, the same survey found.</P>
      <P>The job bank said graduates of private universities such as Tamkang, Feng Chia
and Fujen were also highly praised by local companies.</P>
      <P>According to Fang, 62.63 percent of enterprises said students at local
universities  and colleges  should  increase  their work experience. Some 47.71
percent said foreign language abilities should be improved and 42.29 percent
recommended getting professional aptitude certificates.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan and China will soon sign an economic cooperation framework agreement
(ECFA) with China, Fang said Taiwanese students will definitely face stiffer
competition from China and other countries.</P>
      <P>"Foreign language ability is thus very important, " he said, adding that
obtaining higher degrees or spending time abroad would not necessarily improve
an applicant's chances of obtaining a job.</P>
      <P>The job bank collected 1,127 valid samples for the survey, which had a margin of
error of 1.98 percent.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Despite government scrutiny, property lending still balloons</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Although financial authorities have stepped up efforts to prevent real estate
bubbles, Taiwan's bank loans to property developers are still on the rise,
partly fueling the sky rocketing property prices, analysts said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>In March, bank loans for construction totaled NT$1.06 trillion, up NT$24.2
billion from a month earlier, even hitting a new 13-month high, statistics from
Taiwan's Central Bank showed.</P>
      <P>Local property prices in the first quarter of 2010 rose by about 10 percent from
the same period a year earlier and are expected to grow further for the rest of
the year, according to real estate agency Taiwan Realty Corp., adding that a
recovering local economy was also a factor.</P>
      <P>In recent months, the government authorities have put the booming local property
market under close scrutiny in an attempt to prevent escalating market
speculation.</P>
      <P>The speculation is largely driven by anticipation of a boom in property values
after Taiwan signs a landmark trade agreement with mainland China, which is
expected to bring an infusion of Chinese capital to Taiwan's market. Also
driving the speculation is extra cash flowing around from people who are still
cautious about investing too heavily in stock markets.</P>
      <P>Market observers  remain skeptical  of the impacts of the government's efforts
to stabilize the property market as loans for property purchases are still
growing.</P>
      <P>"The move adopted by the financial authorities is not harsh at all. I do not
expect it will impose any immediate impact on property prices, " Lee Jian-ming,
an analyst with Sinyi Realty Inc., told CNA.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  the central bank and the Financial Supervisory Commission are
tightening measures in examining banks' lending practices due to fears that
rising bank loans to property speculators will boost housing prices.</P>
      <P>In the initial stage, the financial authorities targeted bank lending to luxury
residential property buyers, and now they are also monitoring loans to land
investors as well as loans to property developers by asking banks to keep an eye
on risk control.</P>
      <P>Last week, the authorities staked out about 10 banks to check whether they have
followed government instructions to cut investment property lending and raise
interest rate levels for property loans.</P>
      <P>Under the examination, banks had to show the authorities how they reviewed
property loan applications and how they set interest rates.</P>
      <P>Through such strict examination measures, the authorities hope they can get a
better sense about whether and how property developers are hoarding land for
future profits, and how the property market will evolve.</P>
      <P>"But what property investors fear is interest rate hikes by the Central Bank,"
Lee said.</P>
      <P>But he added that was unlikely to happen.</P>
      <P>"As the local economy remains on the way to a recovery, it is unlikely for the
central bank to employ such a dramatic way to hurt the real economy," Lee said.</P>
      <P>Lee said foreign funds are expected to continue to flow into the island and
local real estate will be one of their major investment targets.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Realty analyst Brian Lee agreed, adding he expects local prices for the
whole of 2010 to rise by up to 15 percent from 2009 levels and the peak is
expected to be seen in the third quarter.</P>
      <P>Banks also said they believe the government has no intention of depressing
property prices, but just want to "stabilize" the local real estate market.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Premier says drugs are biggest threat to public security</HEADLINE>

(By Hsieh Chia-chen, Justin Su and Fanny Liu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih said Wednesday that the problem of drugs poses the biggest
threat to Taiwan's public security at present, and the authorities should
intensify their clamp down against drugs.</P>
      <P>During the first three months of this year, police seized a total of 1,922
kilograms of drugs, up 1,099 kg, or 75 percent from the same period last year,
according to the National Policy Agency (NPA) under the Ministry of the
Interior.</P>
      <P>Police investigated a total of 12,225 cases involving the possession of drugs in
the first quarter, up 987 from the same period last year, the NPA said at a
conference on public security in the Executive Yuan.</P>
      <P>And 12,816 suspects were arrested, up 1,068, or 9 percent, from the same time
last year, the agency said.</P>
      <P>One of the reasons why the number of drug cases and people arrested have
increased is because ketamine has been classified as an illegal drug, according
to the agency.</P>
      <P>Under a law revision that took effect last November, individuals who possess
more than 20 grams of "third-grade" banned drugs like ketamine are subject to a
jail sentence of up to three years. Those who possess less than 20 grams of the
drug will be fined between NT$10,000 (US$317) to NT$50,000.</P>
      <P>To further prevent the spread of ketamine,  a legislative judiciary and laws and
statutes committee asked the Ministry of Justice Wednesday to discuss within one
month whether ketamine should be reclassified from a "third-grade" to a "second-
grade" banned drug, so that heavier criminal responsibility will be applied to
those drug possessors.</P>
      <P>Deputy Minister of Justice Wu Chen-huan said that most members of the ministry's
drug review committee considered ketamine as a party drug with limited drug
dependence.</P>
      <P>Classifying the drug as a second-grade drug may increase the cost to society, Wu
said. Such a change could also result in more people who would be arrested
dropping out of school or losing their jobs, he said.</P>
      <P>Premier Wu on Wednesday requested the police agency to not only step up

      <P>The Mexican Trade Services Documentation and Cultural Office in Taiwan is
embracing the arts with a new art gallery in the waiting area for visa
applicants, greatly changing people's impression of the space, the head of the
office said.</P>
      <P>Cultural communication is the most natural and best way to let Taiwanese people
know more about Mexico, Martin Munoz Ledo Villegas , head of the Mexican office,
told the Central News Agency when asked about the reasons for establishing the
gallery.</P>
      <P>The current exhibit showcases 12 works by 11 contemporary Mexican female artists
and runs through May 28.</P>
      <P>Munoz Ledo said he thought of setting up the gallery because "the area is not
only for applying papers, but can be a corner presenting artworks. Actually we
also have used the space for all kinds of activities, such as concerts,
lectures, arts and many others since last year."</P>
      <P>He also welcomed other foreign offices in Taiwan to use the space to present
their cultures.</P>
      <P>The exhibition, which opened this month, features porcelain and oil paintings by
female Mexican artists including Monica Castillo, Alicia Paz and Irma Palacios.</P>
      <P>"Most of these works are strongly influenced by world-famous Mexican painters
Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo, " the office chief said.</P>
      <P>"I hope that we can also bring Diego Rivera's and Frida Kahlo's works here in
the future. This event is to pave the road for that, " he said.</P>
      <P>Having been assigned to Taiwan for three and a half years, the office chief
thinks that the key for promoting exchange is based on a mutual understanding of
the countries' people.</P>
      <P>Munoz Ledo said he hoped to increase tourism and business opportunities by
introducing Mexican culture, food and art, and expanding local understanding of
his country.</P>
      <P>Statistics from the office show that in recent years, the number of Taiwanese
tourists to Mexico has increased greatly, propelling Taiwan into second place
after India for Asian tourists, he said.</P>
      <P>"In 2006, my office issued about 4,000 visas, of which business visas accounted
for approximately 85 percent to 90 percent, " Munoz Ledo said. "But in 2009, we
issued 6,000 visas, with business visas dropping to 60 percent of the total and
the remainder being tourist visas."</P>
      <P>Munoz Ledo said he was encouraged by the numbers and has set a goal this year to
persuade even more Taiwanese people to go to Mexico.</P>
      <P>"I hope that the number from Taiwan will surpass the number from India," he
said.</P>

      <P>A children's rights advocacy organization said on Wednesday that increasing
reports of child abuse showed Taiwan needed to hire 2,500 more social workers.</P>
      <P>On average, there is one case of child abuse reported every two days, said Yeh
Ta-hwa, secretary-general of Taiwan Alliance for Advancement of Youth Rights and
Welfare.</P>
      <P>Yeh attributed the situation partly to a dearth of social workers trained to
work with children.</P>
      <P>From January to April there were 61 cases of child victims of murder-suicides,
child abuse and sexual abuse on campuses or in homes, with 19 deaths and 17
injuries.</P>
      <P>The figures showed that the existing Child and Youth Welfare Code is not enough
to protect children, Yeh said.</P>
      <P>Yeh said Taiwan has a severe shortage of social workers, with only 55 social
workers at schools in five cities and counties.</P>
      <P>The ratio of school social workers to students is about 1: 1,000 in many
countries, and Taiwan has more than 2 million students, according to Yeh.</P>
      <P>If the country wants to keep up, it should add 2,500 more social workers in
schools and help centers, Yeh said.</P>
      <P>The alliance is pushing for legislation to protect children and youth, and to
enable Taiwan to keep abreast of international standards of child protection.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) , acting on behalf of a Taiwanese
fishing boat which was recently hit by a Chinese fishing vessel, wrote a letter
Wednesday to its Chinese counterpart asking for compensation from the Chinese
ship.</P>
      <P>It was the reported that the Taiwanese boat from Suao in eastern Taiwan's Yilan
County was scraped on the side by the Chinese vessel that was operating nearby
in the area.</P>
      <P>Four Indonesian fishermen working for another Taiwanese fishing ship boarded the
Chinese boat to try to help with the incident, but the Chinese vessel
nevertheless escaped from the scene at full speed.</P>
      <P>The four fishermen were later brought back to Taiwan after Taiwan's coast guard
authorities dispatched a vessel to their rescue.</P>
      <P>SEF said Wednesday it is now asking ARATS to help the Taiwanese vessel seek
NT$11 million in compensation from the Chinese ship.</P>
      <P>According to SEF Deputy Secretary General Kao Wen-cheng, the SEF immediately
sent the letter to the ARATS over the compensation issue after it got relevant
papers from the Taiwanese ship owner.</P>
      <P>"We soon contacted the Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Straits (ARATS)  for some NT$11 million in compensation from the Chinese ship

    <HEADLINE>Presidential Office questions DPP head over cross-strait trade pact</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Presidential Office on Wednesday raised several questions regarding a
proposed cross-strait trade pact with China and asked opposition Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen to answer them.</P>
      <P>Lo Chih-chiang, spokesman of the Presidential Office, said the DPP has continued
to claim that President Ma Ying-jeou evaded the questions raised by Tsai during
the high-profile debate between the two on Sunday over the issue, but actually,
it was Tsai who failed to answer questions raised by Ma.</P>
      <P>Lo asked that if Tsai's fear of signing the proposed cross-strait economic
cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) is that Taiwan will open itself up to
Chinese products within a decade, does that mean that the DPP will not sign any
trade pact similar to that of the ECFA with China within the 10 year period?</P>
      <P>Lo also asked how long the DPP thinks Taiwan can afford to drag its feet as all
Asian countries are engaging in economic integration, and as Taiwan's exports to
major markets are declining.</P>
      <P>Tsai had also questioned whether Taiwan has relied too much on China in terms of
its exports. But Lo said if this is so, how come the DPP did not take any action
during its eight years in office when the percentage of Taiwan's exports going
to China surged from 24 percent to 40 percent.</P>
      <P>Tsai has admitted that the DPP had opened Taiwan's market to 936 mainland
Chinese agricultural products during its rule between 2000 and 2008, but Ma has
not added any new items since his inauguration in May 2008. Then why is the DPP
accusing Ma of selling out Taiwan, Lo asked.</P>
      <P>The Presidential Office also asked what the DPP thinks are the alternative
options for Taiwan if it does not sign the trade agreement with China, Taiwan's
biggest trade partner and export market.</P>
      <P>If the high-tariff sectors go to China for investment, then the industrial
exodus will lead to unemployment, Lo said, asking how Tsai would deal with the
unemployment problem.</P>
      <P>On Tsai's declaration the previous day that if the DPP returns to power in 2012,
it will initiate a national referendum to scrap the ECFA, Lo said that this
shows that the DPP only thinks about the 2012 presidential election and has not
thought about the economic future of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In response, a DPP spokesman said Wednesday that Tsai has provided the Ma
administration with good recommendations based on her professionalism and
knowledge of related issues, but Ma did not want to address the issues of the
impact of the ECFA on Taiwan's people, the government's contingency measures, as
well as the public's misgivings about the trade pact.</P>
      <P>DPP spokesman Tsai Chi-chang said the questions raised by the Presidential
Office are for political gains, and the DPP will have no time for it, but it
welcomes Ma to have more debates on the trade agreement issue if he is willing
to return to a more professional stance.</P>
      <P>Tsai Chi-chang also said that if President Ma continues to ignore the voice of
the people, and insists on signing the ECFA in June, then if the DPP returns to
power, it will initiate a referendum to let people decide whether to continue or
terminate the ECFA.</P>
      <P>Tsai Chi-chang said that the signing of the ECFA will trigger the most serious
wealth redistribution in Taiwan's history.</P>
      <P>"Shouldn't the government listen to the people's voice and let the people decide
through a referendum on the process of this kind of wealth redistribution?" he
asked.</P>
      <P>Tsai Chi-chang said that as the gap between the rich and poor in Taiwan is
already big, judging from the experience of the Closer Economic Partnership
Arrangement (CEPA) signed between Hong Kong and China, if an ECFA is signed, the
gap will be even wider.</P>
      <P>Tsai Ing-wen believes that if a policy will change the wealth map and benefit
only a few, then why not listen to the people and let them decide, according to
Tsai Chi-chang.</P>

      <P>Taiwan is preparing to open academies in Los Angeles and Houston to promote
Taiwanese culture and help Americans understand the value of traditional Chinese
characters, a senior official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>"The initiative to set up a Taiwan Academy in Los Angeles and Houston is
entering a final stage and could be put in practice as soon as the end of this
year, " said Emile Sheng, minister of the Council for Cultural Affairs (CCA).</P>
      <P>Fielding questions at a hearing of the Legislative Yuan's Committee on Education
and Cultural Affairs, Sheng said the CCA will discuss details regarding the
Taiwan Academy initiative with other government agencies in May and that if all
goes well, the program to promote the study of traditional Chinese characters
and introduce Taiwanese culture will be launched late this year.</P>
      <P>Sheng admitted that the Taiwan Academy initiative echoes China's efforts to set
up Confucius Institutes to promote Chinese language and culture.</P>
      <P>China has so far established more than 500 Confucius Institutes around the
world. The rapidly growing number of Confucius Institutes has even prompted some
Americans into thinking that Confucianism is a religion, according to ruling
Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator Chiang Nai-hsin.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the same session, KMT Legislator Hung Hsiu-chu said Taiwan should
not sit idly by while China actively promotes Chinese language and culture, as
Taiwan has been a stronghold for preserving traditional Chinese culture.</P>
      <P>"We may be unable to compete with China in terms of quantity, but we have an
edge in presenting Chinese culture experts and enthusiasts an alternative
choice," Hung said.</P>
      <P>In addition to letting the international community know that there is another
Chinese-speaking world, Hung said, Taiwan Academy should provide a unique core
value or concept to distinguish it from China's Confucius Institute.</P>
      <P>Sheng said he shares Hung's views.</P>
      <P>"Our top goal is helping foreigners understand that Taiwanese traditional
culture and traditional Chinese characters are more valuable than the simplified
Chinese characters presently used in China," he said.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou ordered the Ministry of Transportation and Communications
(MOTC) Wednesday to help the families of those who were killed in massive
landslide on the No. 3 National Freeway to apply for national compensation.</P>
      <P>Ma, who is also chairman of the ruling Kuomintang, issued a directive by phone
to Transport Minister Mao Chi-kuo for the MOTC to show the government's
sincerity by offering help to the families instead of waiting for them to appeal
for assistance, said KMT spokesman Su Jun-pin.</P>
      <P>The president gave the directive before a KMT Central Standing Committee meeting
at which he asked for a moment of silence in memory of the victims and in
sympathy with their families.</P>
      <P>Rescue workers on Wednesday dug out four bodies from the rubble at the site of
the landslide that occurred Sunday.</P>
      <P>Mao said later in the day at a press conference that Deputy Transport Minister
Yeh Kuang-shih had met with the relatives of the victims and given each family
condolence compensation of NT$1 million (US$31,786) . He also provided them with
information on how to apply for national compensation, according to Mao.</P>
      <P>Yeh said that the relatives of Kuo Wen-han, the driver of a black Mercedes Benz
that was crushed by the landslide, have said they will apply for national
compensation but the other three families have not yet decided.</P>
      <P>The MOTC will do its best to help the families, Mao stressed.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a 10-member investigation committee commissioned by the ministry to
investigate the cause of the landslide was assembled Wednesday, with Liao Hung-
jiun, a professor at National Taiwan University of Science and Technology,
serving as the head. Its members will include experts in the areas of geology,
civil engineering, soil and water conservation, and earth science.</P>
      <P>The committee will search for clues to the cause of the disaster -- the worst on
a freeway in 30 years -- and will mobilize 50-60 engineers to carry out safety
checks on all the slopes along the freeway.</P>
      <P>Lao said the results of the checks can be completed within a week if the weather
permits.</P>

      <P>Taipei City suffered the worst housing shortage among all the cities and

74,868 units, the Ministry of Interior (MOI) said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>According to the MOI's Construction and Planning Agency, Taichung City in
central Taiwan was out front in terms of housing supply, with a surplus of
73,104 units in Q4 2009.</P>
      <P>In addition to the capital city, other areas that recorded housing shortages in
the fourth quarter of last year included Yunlin County, Kaohsiung County and
Kinmen County, the agency said.</P>
      <P>Figures for that quarter show that the total number of households in the country

supply of housing units was 7.83 million, up 0.91 percent year-on-year, the

      <P>Although there was a country-wide surplus of 33,000 units, it did not
necessarily mean that there was an adequate supply of housing, an official at
the agency said, adding the figures did not reflect the movement of residents.</P>
      <P>The number of building permits in Q4 was 18,223, up 28.4 percent from the same

      <P>The British Museum plans to acquire two paintings by Liu Kuo-sung, one of the
most famous Taiwanese modernist ink painting masters, when an ongoing exhibition
of his works in London ends, arts sources said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>A collection of 25 of Liu's paintings that is currently on display in the U.K.
has been highly acclaimed by the British arts community.</P>
      <P>It is the 78-year-old painter's first exhibition in London after a 30-year
hiatus.</P>
      <P>The British Museum has shown keen interest in acquiring two of the works on
display -- "Rising Sun," a color ink painting created in 2008 and "Sun and Moon:
Floating? Sinking? " that was done in 1970, sources close to the museum said.</P>
      <P>Chang Siao-yue, Taiwan's representative to the United Kingdom, told the Central
News Agency after visiting the exhibition the previous day that she admires
Liu's work and is very happy to learn that the British Museum plans to acquire
some of his masterpieces.</P>
      <P>"Buying master Liu's paintings will never be a bad decision," she added.</P>
      <P>Liu's paintings have been shown at many well-known museums in the United States,
Switzerland, Italy, Germany, Australia, Malaysia, the Philippines and other
countries. The Beijing Palace Museum has not only held an exhibition of his
works but has also acquired some of them.</P>
      <P>If the British Museum, one of the world's top three museums, indeed acquires two
of Liu's paintings, it will be yet another milestone in his career which spans
more than six decades.</P>
      <P>Liu described the two paintings sought after by the British Museum as exquisite
and impeccable works that rank among his favorites.</P>
      <P>Michael Goedhuis, an arts agent who organized Liu's London show, said Liu was
the first artist of Chinese descent to diligently study Western painting art and
techniques, in the 1950s.</P>
      <P>Goedhuis said Liu has spent 40 years creating a new painting style that
incorporates Western arts concepts and classic Chinese civilization.</P>
      <P>Liu's efforts to blend Western and Chinese arts and cultures have infused new
life into traditional Chinese ink and brush paintings, said Goedhuis, adding
that Liu has been a trailblazer in the modernization of Chinese fine art.</P>
      <P>Liu's exhibition has been highly praised by the British media, arts critics and
museum curators and many orders have been received for his paintings.</P>

      <P>A "zero-energy building" developed by a team led by a National Taiwan University
(NTU) professor were unveiled Wednesday at a seminar titled 2010 Solar Building
Technology and Industry Development at the university in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Huang Bin-juine, director of NTU's New Energy Center and a professor in the
Department of Mechanical Engineering, presented the technology -- the result of
concerted efforts by more than 10 graduate students and engineering researchers
at the center.</P>
      <P>The 13-square-meter building, which was constructed using thermal insulation and
high-efficiency environmental control technologies as well as solar energy
generation systems, can be used by three people, according to Huang.</P>
      <P>He said it was developed to run on solar power alone, without the need for
petrochemical energy.</P>
      <P>With only a few members of the team specializing in architecture, there is room
for improvement in the design and planning of the structure, according to Huang.</P>
      <P>A new generation of zero-energy buildings is expected to be rolled out within
six months and the technologies for mass production of such buildings are near

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou ordered the Ministry of Transportation and Communications
(MOTC) Wednesday to help the families of those who were killed in massive
landslide on the No. 3 National Freeway to apply for national compensation.</P>
      <P>Ma, who is also chairman of the ruling Kuomintang, issued a directive by phone
to Transport Minister Mao Chi-kuo for the MOTC to show the government's
sincerity by offering help to the families instead of waiting for them to appeal
for assistance, said KMT spokesman Su Jun-pin.</P>
      <P>The president gave the directive before a KMT Central Standing Committee meeting
at which he asked for a moment of silence in memory of the victims and in
sympathy with their families.</P>
      <P>Rescue workers on Wednesday dug out four bodies from the rubble at the site of
the landslide that occurred Sunday.</P>
      <P>Mao said later in the day at a press conference that Deputy Transport Minister
Yeh Kuang-shih had met with the relatives of the victims and given each family
condolence compensation of NT$1 million (US$31,786) . He also provided them with
information on how to apply for national compensation, according to Mao.</P>
      <P>Yeh said that the relatives of Kuo Wen-han, the driver of a black Mercedes Benz
that was crushed by the landslide, have said they will apply for national
compensation but the other three families have not yet decided.</P>
      <P>The MOTC will do its best to help the families, Mao stressed.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a 10-member investigation committee commissioned by the ministry to
investigate the cause of the landslide was assembled Wednesday, with Liao Hung-
jiun, a professor at National Taiwan University of Science and Technology,
serving as the head. Its members will include experts in the areas of geology,
civil engineering, soil and water conservation, and earth science.</P>
      <P>The committee will search for clues to the cause of the disaster -- the worst on
a freeway in 30 years -- and will mobilize 50-60 engineers to carry out safety
checks on all the slopes along the freeway.</P>
      <P>Lao said the results of the checks can be completed within a week if the weather
permits.</P>

      <P>Taipei City suffered the worst housing shortage among all the cities and
counties in Taiwan in the last quarter of 2009, falling short of demand by
74,868 units, the Ministry of Interior (MOI) said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>According to the MOI's Construction and Planning Agency, Taichung City in
central Taiwan was out front in terms of housing supply, with a surplus of
73,104 units in Q4 2009.</P>
      <P>In addition to the capital city, other areas that recorded housing shortages in
the fourth quarter of last year included Yunlin County, Kaohsiung County and
Kinmen County, the agency said.</P>
      <P>Figures for that quarter show that the total number of households in the country
was 7.8 million units, up 1.96 percent from the same period of 2008, and the
supply of housing units was 7.83 million, up 0.91 percent year-on-year, the
agency said.</P>
      <P>Although there was a country-wide surplus of 33,000 units, it did not
necessarily mean that there was an adequate supply of housing, an official at
the agency said, adding the figures did not reflect the movement of residents.</P>
      <P>The number of building permits in Q4 was 18,223, up 28.4 percent from the same
period of 2008, while the number of permits for occupancy of residence was
17,387, down 33.7 percent year-on-year, the agency said.</P>
      <P>The worst housing shortage in Taipei City occurred in Q3 2006, when demand
exceeded supply by 81,861 units, according to the agency.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The British Museum plans to acquire two paintings by Liu Kuo-sung, one of the
most famous Taiwanese modernist ink painting masters, when an ongoing exhibition
of his works in London ends, arts sources said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>A collection of 25 of Liu's paintings that is currently on display in the U.K.
has been highly acclaimed by the British arts community.</P>
      <P>It is the 78-year-old painter's first exhibition in London after a 30-year
hiatus.</P>
      <P>The British Museum has shown keen interest in acquiring two of the works on
display -- "Rising Sun," a color ink painting created in 2008 and "Sun and Moon:
Floating? Sinking? " that was done in 1970, sources close to the museum said.</P>
      <P>Chang Siao-yue, Taiwan's representative to the United Kingdom, told the Central
News Agency after visiting the exhibition the previous day that she admires
Liu's work and is very happy to learn that the British Museum plans to acquire
some of his masterpieces.</P>
      <P>"Buying master Liu's paintings will never be a bad decision," she added.</P>
      <P>Liu's paintings have been shown at many well-known museums in the United States,
Switzerland, Italy, Germany, Australia, Malaysia, the Philippines and other
countries. The Beijing Palace Museum has not only held an exhibition of his
works but has also acquired some of them.</P>
      <P>If the British Museum, one of the world's top three museums, indeed acquires two
of Liu's paintings, it will be yet another milestone in his career which spans
more than six decades.</P>
      <P>Liu described the two paintings sought after by the British Museum as exquisite
and impeccable works that rank among his favorites.</P>
      <P>Michael Goedhuis, an arts agent who organized Liu's London show, said Liu was
the first artist of Chinese descent to diligently study Western painting art and
techniques, in the 1950s.</P>
      <P>Goedhuis said Liu has spent 40 years creating a new painting style that
incorporates Western arts concepts and classic Chinese civilization.</P>
      <P>Liu's efforts to blend Western and Chinese arts and cultures have infused new
life into traditional Chinese ink and brush paintings, said Goedhuis, adding
that Liu has been a trailblazer in the modernization of Chinese fine art.</P>
      <P>Liu's exhibition has been highly praised by the British media, arts critics and
museum curators and many orders have been received for his paintings.</P>
      <P>Liu and his wife have already left London for a lecture tour in China.</P>

Technology and Industry Development at the university in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Huang Bin-juine, director of NTU's New Energy Center and a professor in the
Department of Mechanical Engineering, presented the technology -- the result of
concerted efforts by more than 10 graduate students and engineering researchers
at the center.</P>
      <P>The 13-square-meter building, which was constructed using thermal insulation and
high-efficiency environmental control technologies as well as solar energy
generation systems, can be used by three people, according to Huang.</P>
      <P>He said it was developed to run on solar power alone, without the need for
petrochemical energy.</P>
      <P>With only a few members of the team specializing in architecture, there is room
for improvement in the design and planning of the structure, according to Huang.</P>

      <P>In Taiwan, a lot of legislation can be described using the Chinese proverb "not
shedding a tear until one sees the coffin." One example is the geology bill,
which has long been stalled in the Legislative Yuan and is now receiving
attention from lawmakers only after people were killed in a recent landslide on
the No. 3 National Freeway.</P>
      <P>It is shameful to even speak of why legislators refused to review the bill for
so many years. It was because of their collusion with property developers, who
could suffer great losses if their hillside development  projects  were to be
banned  under the proposal. Legislators even failed to change their minds when
the Lincoln Mansions -- a hillside residential complex in Sijhih, Taipei County
-- collapsed in 1997.</P>
      <P>The bill even cleared the legislature in 2004. However, a group of 42
legislators, most of whom were from the blue camp, wanted it to be reconsidered
on grounds that it would cause inconvenience for the public. It has since been
paralyzed.</P>
      <P>The bill would require the government to publicize areas with sensitive
geological conditions and limit development projects there. Permission to build
in those areas would only be granted if they passed geological surveys and
safety assessments. No wonder property developers are opposing it vigorously.</P>
      <P>It is frightening to see high-rise buildings covering the hillsides of the
greater Taipei area. With constant earthquakes and the increased frequency of
heavy rains because of climate change, those households can only rely on luck or
pray for their safety because they have legislators who collude with business
groups.</P>

    <HEADLINE>United Daily News: ECFA, a springboard for globalization</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>04/29/10  12:48:33
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Democratic Progressive Party Chairperson Tsai Ing-wen recently said
that by attempting to sign an economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA)
with China, the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) is trying to lead Taiwan's economy to
the world via China.</P>
      <P>During her debate with President Ma Ying-jeou, Tsai said that the DPP, which
held power from 2000 to 2008, had on the contrary taken steps to "lead Taiwan
toward China via the world."</P>
      <P>Tsai opposed Ma's push to sign an ECFA with China too quickly, which she said
would make Taiwan's economy overly dependent on China. She suggested Taiwan
first build multilateral trade ties with China and the rest of the world under
the World Trade Organization (WTO) framework.</P>
      <P>Tsai's suggestion was unrealistic, given that the WTO's Doha round of talks has
stalled and trade liberalization has not worked in Taiwan's favor.</P>
      <P>The ECFA, however, is seen to open Taiwan's market "in a gradual manner" and
pave the way for Taiwan to enhance trade ties with other WTO member countries
and strike free trade agreements (FTAs) with other countries.</P>
      <P>This can be seen as a two-step approach that will act as a springboard for
Taiwan to trade globalization.</P>
      <P>If Taiwan can survive the ECFA trial and gradually improve its business and
trade relations with China, the country will be in a better position to meet the
challenges of opening its market.</P>
      <P>Tsai is mistaken in supporting the WTO but opposing an ECFA. Taiwan would have
to open its doors much wider to imports from China and many other WTO member
countries if the Doha agreements are put into force, but an ECFA would allow
freer two-way trade only across the Taiwan Strait, with Taiwan enjoying room to
maneuver. (April 29, 2010).</P>

    <HEADLINE>Astrophysicists unveil shape of dark matter's distribution</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>An international team of astrophysicists including Japanese scholars working at
Academia Sinica discovered clear, direct evidence about the shape of dark
matter's distribution, according to a press release from Taiwan's top research
institute Thursday.</P>
      <P>Dark matter is an enigma of the cosmos that has fascinated astrophysicists for
many years. The existence of dark matter was originally hypothesized to account
for discrepancies found between measurements of the mass of galaxies, clusters
of galaxies and the entire universe.</P>
      <P>As dark matter is invisible and no "dark matter particle" has been discovered,
however, its existence is only inferred from a gravitational effect on other
visible celestial matter or theoretical models, the scientists said.</P>
      <P>Recently,  astrophysicists from Japan and Taiwan, including Postdoctoral Fellow
Nobuhiro Okabe from the Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics at Academia
Sinica (ASIAA), have evidence that dark matter is distributed in an elliptical
shape in massive clusters of galaxies,  a finding that confirms a major
prediction in the prevailing theory about dark matter.</P>
      <P>The team observed the clusters of galaxies using the Subaru Telescope's Prime
Focus Camera (Suprime-Cam) . Observations with Suprime-Cam yielded wide-field
images of massive clusters of galaxies -- typically located 3 billion light
years from Earth -- which the team then used to measure and analyze dark matter
distribution, the institute said in a press statement.</P>
      <P>From their analysis of the images, the team obtained evidence that the
distribution of dark matter in the clusters has, on average, an extremely
flattened shape rather than a simple spherical shape. The degree of the
flattening was quite large, corresponding to ratio of 2: 1 in terms of the ratio
of the major to minor axes of the ellipse.</P>
      <P>The team's article, entitled "Direct measurement of dark matter halo ellipticity
from two-dimensional lensing shear maps of 25 massive clusters, " was published
online April 23 in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, a leading
astrophysics journal.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Talk of the day -- New momentum on geological bill</HEADLINE>

      <P>The mudslide that buried a section of a freeway and took four lives last Sunday
has led to new momentum on discussion  of legislation intended to govern the
development of geologically fragile areas.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from local leading newspapers' reports of the issue.
China Times:</P>
      <P>Last Sunday's mudslide that buried a section of the No. 3 National Freeway and
killed four has drawn public attention to the enactment of a draft geological
act, with lawmakers across the political spectrum vowing to railroad it through
the legislature.</P>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan's Economics Committee decided to alter its agenda on
Thursday to listen to a brief by Minister of Transportation and Communications
Mao Chih-kuo on the disaster and potential mudslide threats to the country's
highways.</P>
      <P>Tsao Shu-chung, director of the Central Geological Survey under the Ministry of
the Economic Affairs, said the bill was crafted to make public the geologically
sensitive areas around the country, regulating  their development  and improving
the management of geological data.</P>
      <P>The geological bill was intended to safeguard the security of the public by
stepping up geological surveys and the management of geological data and
employing them in construction projects.</P>
      <P>The bill went through the Legislative Yuan in 2004 but was put on hold after a
group of legislators led by current Nantou Magistrate Cho Po-yuan asked for
reconsideration on the grounds that parts of it conflicted with existing laws.
The group also said the proposal would oblige farmers to conduct unnecessary
geological surveys before building their houses.</P>
      <P>Their request for reconsideration was approved by the legislature and the bill
was remanded to the Executive Yuan for improvement, but it soon lost momentum.</P>
      <P>Legislator Wong Chin-chu of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) said that
current Premier Wu Den-yih helped kill the bill by endorsing Cho's request in
2004.</P>
      <P>"It is ridiculous that he would change his mind and push for it now," Wong said.</P>
      <P>The premier said he asked for reconsideration  because of conflicts in the bill
and that he would urge the legislature to support it now that the bill has been
revised.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lin Hung-chi, secretary of the legislative caucus of ruling
Kuomintang (KMT) , said Sunday's mudslide underscored the importance of the bill
and that the KMT caucus will shepherd it through as soon as possible. (April 29,
2010) United Daily News:</P>
      <P>Public Construction Commission Minister Fan Liang-shiow said no geologically
sensitive areas should be developed. "The government will set an example in this
regard," he said.</P>
      <P>Legislator Chien Chao-tong of the DPP is one of the 41 lawmakers who endorsed
Cho's reconsideration request in 2004. He said he supported the request because
of the bill's restrictions on farmers. Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>The DPP criticized Premier Wu Den-yih for blocking the geological bill in 2004
and now, finding he was mistaken, going all out to push for it.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou's administration revised the bill and presented it to the
legislature again earlier this year. However, it was returned to the Executive
Yuan for additional review by the Economics Committee in March.</P>
      <P>Legislator Huang Wei-cher of the DPP prodded the government to disclose housing
projects and public construction projects that are threatened by mudslides,
without regard to the impact on housing prices and pressure from real estate
developers. (April 29, 2010)</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Following  the debate between President  Ma Ying-jeou  and opposition Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP)  Chairperson Tsai Ing-wen on a proposed trade pact with
China, we find that two issues crucial to Taiwan's economic development deserve
further discussion.</P>
      <P>First, Ma's statement that "trade is Taiwan's life" indicated that he fully
understood where the true problem lies, and he also put forth possible
solutions. Now that he is heading in the right direction, he should persist and
remove all obstacles to carry out the plans.</P>
      <P>Second, when speaking of the differences between the DPP and Ma's Kuomintang
(KMT) , Tsai said "the DPP is approaching China via the world, while the KMT is
approaching the world via China."</P>
      <P>However,  the DPP's indirect  approach  of trying  to use multilateral
arrangements to gain access to China has been proven a failure. After missing
out for eight years, can Taiwan continue to wait?</P>
      <P>Tsai also said that by signing a trade pact with China alone, Taiwan could tilt
the regional strategic balance and lead to the creation of a "China-centered"
East Asia. But in fact, no country can block China from becoming the center of
East Asia. With all the countries in the region scrambling to get on the high-
speed train driven by China's economic growth, Taiwan will only end up in a dead
end if it allows itself to be shut out.</P>
      <P>The differences should be resolved through rational discussion in the
Legislative Yuan. The strategy that is considered the most favorable to Taiwan
and is accepted by most people should be considered the right strategy. (April

      <P>The air quality in most of Taiwan has returned to normal, which suggests that
the effects of a dust storm from China has lessened, the Environmental
Protection Administration (EPA) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Chu  Yu-Chi,  director-general  of the EPA's  Environmental Monitoring and
Information Management unit, said observation stations islandwide have recorded
safe levels of air quality, thanks to heavy rainfall over the past few days.</P>
      <P>However, in Taiwan's outlying islands such as Kinmen and Matsu, a higher volume
of dust particles -- 200 micrograms per cubic meter -- was recorded, Chu said.</P>
      <P>Also, the levels still remain slightly higher than normal, at around 150
micrograms per cubic meter, in several regions of northern Taiwan such as Kuan
Yin, Wan Li and Shih Lin, Chu added.</P>
      <P>Due to strong winds that could carry the dust around, the air quality is likely
to vary in different regions of the country from time to time, he said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's top financial regulator said Thursday that the country's risks in
Europe are "at a controllable level" amid fears that Greece will collapse
financially and drag all of Europe down with it.</P>
      <P>Sean Chen, chairman of the Cabinet-level Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC)
, said during a legislative session that financial investments Taiwanese banks
and securities houses have made in Europe totaled about NT$33.7 billion (US$1.07
billion) , an amount that can be handled if problems there escalate.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks in response to ruling Kuomintang Legislator Lai Shyh-bao,
a Legislative Yuan Finance Committee member, who said that Greece's debt crisis
could trigger a financial plague throughout Europe as national credit dries up
in Italy, Portugal and Ireland.</P>
      <P>Lai asked Chen whether he thought the credit crisis could sweep through Europe
or even the whole world, and what possible impact Greece's credit collapse could
have on Taiwan's finance market.</P>
      <P>Chen responded that soon after Greece's credit worries started, the FSC surveyed
Taiwanese banks and financial service firms that operate in European funds and
securities.</P>
      <P>"I'm not sure whether those Taiwanese investors will eventually bear some of the
weight of the Greek crisis, but it looks manageable to me as of now," Chen told
Lai.</P>
      <P>Chen also said he was waiting for a signal from Berlin on how quickly a bailout
could be delivered to rescue Greece. German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schauble
is currently head of the International Monetary Fund.</P>
      <P>The German government was highly intelligent, Chen said, adding that it had
decided to make known the bailout plan on May 10, one day after the federal
elections, out of consideration that a majority of the German public are against
financial aid.</P>
      <P>Chen said he believes Germany will grant aid to Greece to help ease the
burgeoning debt load and keep the euro-zone stable.</P>

      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih ordered government agencies Thursday to step up monitoring of
water management in southern Taiwan, as the Kaohsiung and Tainan areas would
face a shortage if the current dry spell continues.</P>
      <P>Although the situation in northern Taiwan has eased after recent rainfall, Wu
said the Kaohsiung and Tainan areas could see problems starting in June.</P>
      <P>"All government agencies should cooperate in saving water and the Ministry of
Economic Affairs (MOEA) should continue promoting the campaign," the premier
said after hearing a briefing on water supply situations by ministry officials
at a weekly Executive Yuan meeting.</P>
      <P>According to MOEA officials, normal water supply in the two areas could be
affected if the amount of rainfall fails to reach 40 percent of the annual
average by the end of June.</P>
      <P>The premier also ordered relevant authorities to take full anti-flooding
precautions as typhoon season approaches.</P>
      <P>Cultivation of rice for the first harvest in some central and southern counties
has been suspended to save water.</P>
      <P>There has been limited precipitation in southern Taiwan since Typhoon Morakot
lashed the region in August last year.</P>
      <P>The effect of government efforts at generating artificial rain has been limited.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan is planning to attract 500 self- funded graduate students from India next
year, following a bilateral agreement signed in March under which both countries
agreed to mutually recognize higher education diplomas on each side, a Ministry
of Foreign Affairs official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Lee Shieh-ming, director-general of the ministry's Department of East Asian and
Pacific Affairs, said that attracting some of the roughly 500,000 Indian
students who study abroad every year will bring significant economic and
cultural value to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The students will be provided with free Chinese classes during their stays in
Taiwan, said Lee, who added that after graduating, they will be the best
candidates for managerial jobs in Taiwanese companies operating in India.</P>
      <P>"That could also increase Taiwanese businessmen's willingness to invest in India
or expand their investments there, " Lee said at a press conference.</P>
      <P>As Indian students  generally  excel in math and English, attracting more Indian
students to study in Taiwan is also expected to help inspire Taiwanese students'
research and learning abilities, according to Lee.</P>
      <P>Lee said that in the initial stage, the program will focus on enrolling Indian
graduate students and will gradually expand to include undergrads.</P>
      <P>There are 370 Indian graduate students studying in Taiwan at present.</P>
      <P>Lee said the MOFA is also discussing with other Asian countries, including the
Philippines and Vietnam, similar cooperation programs in order to implement
President Ma Ying-jeou's target of attracting 20,000 overseas students to study
in Taiwan during his four-year term.</P>

      <P>The Executive Yuan approved a draft bill Thursday on the development of cloud

      <P>The plan, proposed by the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) , calls for the
investment of NT$24 billion (US$764 million) in cloud computing development by

      <P>Huang Wen-jung, deputy secretary-general of the semiofficial Taiwan External

      <P>A preliminary report on the cause of the April 25 mudslide that buried a section
of the No. 3 Freeway, killing four people, will be ready by May 7, Minister of
Transportation and Communications Mao Chi-kuo said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The minister told the Transport Committee of the Legislative Yuan that an ad hoc
panel of experts and scholars has been set up to probe the cause of the
disaster.</P>
      <P>Mao said the panel will examine whether the freeway was designed, built and
maintained according to norms, and whether those norms should be revamped.</P>
      <P>A detailed joint report and recommendations will be made by the panel, working
with an international panel.</P>
      <P>In order to prevent similar mudslides on other freeways and railways under the
jurisdiction of Ministery of Transportation and Communications, Mao said his
ministry will conduct a survey before mid-May and install monitoring devices in
places with signs of landslides, such as cracks triggered by strain on retaining
walls, falling rocks and dilapidated protection devices.</P>
      <P>On the same occasion, Vice Minister of Transportation and Communications Chang
Chiu-chun said it is impossible to determine whether human error was involved in
the mudslide before the ad hoc panel presents its report.</P>
      <P>Lin Chao-chung, chief of the Central Geological Survey under the Ministry of
Economic Affairs, repeated the vice minister's line while fielding lawmakers'
questions, adding that the scene of the accident was located beneath a dip slope
and was thereby vulnerable to mudslides.</P>
      <P>However, lawmaker Wong Chin-chu of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) said human error was to blame after learning from Chang that no monitoring
devices had been set up at the scene of Sunday's disaster.</P>
      <P>Mao said his ministry would help the families of the dead to claim compensation
from the government, but stopped short of agreeing with lawmakers' demands of
immediate compensation, saying legal procedure must be followed.</P>
      <P>Three DPP lawmakers, led by Chai Trong-rong, called for Mao's resignation for
the disaster, saying he should kneel down to the victims to allay the anger of
their families.</P>
      <P>The disaster took place when a retaining wall along the National Freeway No. 3
near Chidu in Taipei County collapsed without warning, burying a section of the
freeway under hundred of thousands tons of earth.</P>
      <P>Three cars were covered by the earth, while many other vehicles escaped by the
skin of their teeth.</P>
      <P>A round-the-clock rescue operation began immediately after the accident. The
wreckage of the three cars and the four bodies of their occupants had been
found, but the route was still closed to traffic.</P>
      <P>The accident has snarled traffic to and from Keelung, the port city at the
beginning of the freeway, and President Ma Ying-jeou's administration -- which
was criticized for its bungled relief efforts in the wake of Typhoon Morakot
last August -- has tried much harder to cope with this most recent diaster.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Thursday that the government needs to create better
conditions to allow indigenous people to organize autonomous communities.</P>
      <P>Addressing  a national  indigenous  people's  administration conference, Ma said
the government will push for autonomy for indigenous people, and he expressed
hope that the conference -- which has not been held for the past nine years --
can help solve the problems faced by indigenous people.</P>
      <P>"The government should aggressively create conditions for making indigenous
autonomy a reality, " said Ma, adding that the government will review existing
laws, allow the establishment of a test autonomous demonstration area, and help
develop indigenous people's abilities to manage their own affairs.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet is reviewing the indigenous  autonomy bill to determine if any
revisions are needed before the bill is further addressed in the legislature.</P>
      <P>Sun Ta-chuan, minister of the Cabinet-level Council of Indigenous Peoples, said
the bill is not only good for indigenous people, but also meaningful for Taiwan
and he expressed hope that it can be passed in the current legislative session.</P>
      <P>The government plans to offer indigenous people 32,000 jobs over four years,
while indigenous students will be provided with tuition waivers and living
subsidies from kindergarten to graduate school, Ma said.</P>
      <P>He also pointed out that it will be a big challenge to preserve Taiwan's
indigenous languages, which have decreased from some 40 kinds to only about 20
at present.</P>

      <P>Financial services will be high on the "early harvest" list for preferential
market access under an economic cooperation  framework agreement (ECFA)  with
China,  Financial Supervisory Commission Chairman Sean C. Chen said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Fielding questions at a hearing of the Legislative Yuan's Finance Committee,
Chen said financial services were tabbed for the the "early harvest" list from
the very beginning of the ECFA talks.</P>
      <P>During the hearing, ruling Kuomintang Legislator Sun Ta-chien asked whether
financial services will be on the "early harvest" list if the ECFA, a scaled
back free trade agreement, is signed in June as scheduled.</P>
      <P>"Of course, financial services will definitely be high on the 'early harvest'
list... They have been on the list from the beginning of the talks.... There
have not been any changes, " Chen told lawmakers.</P>
      <P>When the negotiations are completed, Chen said, the FSC will unveil details of
the package, with the consent of the other side.</P>
      <P>Noting that the two intermediary bodies on the two sides of the Taiwan Strait
are arranging a new round of ECFA talks, Chen said the FSC has been asked to
"stand by" for the planned meeting.</P>
      <P>The first round of ECFA talks took place Jan. 26 in Beijing and the second round
was held in Taoyuan, some 40 kilometers south of Taipei.</P>
      <P>The quasi-official Straits Exchange Foundation and its Chinese counterpart, the
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait, have not yet announced the
date or venue for the third round of ECFA talks.</P>
      <P>The "early harvest" list, referring to a list of goods and services to be
subject to tariff waivers or favorable market access treatment, forms the
backbone of the proposed ECFA deal with China.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ECFA could marginalize US in East Asia: DPP chair</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 29 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The U.S. presence in East Asia could be compromised as China is expected to
emerge as the region's leader if a cross-Taiwan Strait trade pact forces South
Korea and Japan to seek closer economic ties with China, Taiwan's main
opposition party leader said Thursday.</P>
      <P>At a 60-minute press conference, Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairperson
Tsai Ing-wen addressed dozens of international media members on various
political matters, most notably her debate with President Ma Ying-jeou last
Sunday on the proposed economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA).</P>
      <P>Ma said the agreement, which he intends to sign before June, would ease cross-
strait tension and benefit Taiwan's economy.</P>
      <P>Tsai said the pact would pressure regional powers such as South Korea and Japan
to actively seek free trade agreements (FTAs) with China and eventually shift
the power balance in the region.</P>
      <P>"China will be the center of this region and the U.S. will be marginalized," she
said.</P>
      <P>"We don't have a problem with China leading the region -- if it's a democracy
and a market economy, " she added.</P>
      <P>Tsai said that her party, which has been widely seen as adopting a "zero-sum"
strategy in managing it's cross-strait relations, will pursue a "more stable,
consistent and predictable (China) policy." The DPP will use its experience
ruling the country from 2000 to 2008 to draw up "10-year policy guidelines" that
will improve its ability to manage relations with China as well as the U.S. and
Japan, Tsai said.</P>
      <P>According to the pro-independence DPP, the guidelines will be unveiled in August
and offer flexible strategies for resolving problems facing Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In terms of the ECFA, "it's not as urgent as President Ma said and the benefit
is not as much as the government claimed," Tsai said.</P>
      <P>The ECFA is not necessary to ease cross-strait tensions, Tsai said, adding that
cross-strait relations have been relatively stable due to extensive trade
activity. The real tensions Taiwan needs to address are domestic economic and
social matters, she said.</P>
      <P>Tsai said that the World Trade Organization (WTO) would provide enough room,
protection and mechanisms for Taiwan to boost its economy and deal with
countries all over the world. "There's no need to go beyond the WTO," she said.</P>
      <P>While Ma contended that Taiwan will be able to secure FTAs with other countries
after signing the ECFA, Tsai added, it will set a bad example and appear that
Taiwan needs China's consent before engaging in activities with the
international community.</P>
      <P>At the same time, trade volume between Taiwan and China is expected to increase
after the pact is signed and could cause reduction of trade with other
countries, compromising the incentive for them to sign FTAs with Taiwan, she
said.</P>
      <P>Responding to a question, Tsai said that if the deal is signed and the DPP
returns to power in 2012, it could terminate the agreement or adjust its content
after receiving public consent through either referendum or legislative
discussions.</P>
      <P>Tsai said that one of her biggest domestic concerns is the widening wealth gap.
Citing a poll, she said that only one-third of Taiwan people stand to benefit
from globalization, while two-thirds fail to gain -- or even suffer -- from
trade liberalization.</P>
      <P>The DPP supports a referendum proposal submitted by a minor opposition party,
the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU), that calls for a vote on the ECFA. Tsai said
it would give people "an opportunity to make decisions" on major policy issues.</P>
      <P>The DPP is still assessing the impact of the referendum on five year-end special
municipality elections, she said.</P>

      <P>The Executive Yuan approved the audit of the central government's 2009 budget
Thursday and decided that unclaimed consumer vouchers, valued at about NT$1
billion (US$32 million), would be returned to national coffers.</P>
      <P>The vouchers, worth a total of NT$83.37 billion, were issued by the central
government in early 2009 to Taiwan citizens as part of efforts to prop up the
economy during the global financial crisis.</P>
      <P>According  to  financial  statements  provided  by  the Director-General of
Budget, Accounting and Statistics in the weekly Executive Yuan meeting, NT$1.809
trillion in spending and NT$1.673 billion in revenue were approved for last
year's central government.</P>
      <P>The NT$ 136.5 billion deficit was offset by government agencies through public
borrowing, bank loans and NT$36.5 billion in surplus left over from 2008.</P>
      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih praised retrenchment efforts last year by government agencies
at all levels, lauding the agencies for managing their finances amid sharply

    <HEADLINE>U.S. congressmen call for free trade pact with Taiwan</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  April 28 (CNA)
04/29/10  18:14:35

    <TEXT>
      <P>Three U.S. congressmen urged the U.S. government Wednesday to negotiate a free
trade agreement with Taiwan in light of the fact that China  is ready to sign a
trade liberalization pact with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In a seminar organized by the Washington-based pro-Taiwan group, Formosan
Association of Public Affairs, U.S. Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen said a free trade
pact with Taiwan will increase U.S. exports to Taiwan by 16 percent,  citing  a
study by the United States International Trade Commission.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's  government  hopes to sign a trade liberalization agreement with China
- called the economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) - by June, saying
it is crucial for helping Taiwan avoid economic isolation. The opposition
Democratic Progressive Party, however, has warned that the agreement could make
Taiwan too dependent on China, and hurt Taiwan's workers and industries.</P>
      <P>Branding ECFA as a Trojan horse which led to the fall of Troy according to Greek
legend, the congressman said China is expanding its presence throughout the
whole of Asia, and Washington should not sit on its hands while watching China's
rising dominance in the Asia-Pacific region.</P>
      <P>Rep. Robert Andrews dismissed worries that Washington would raise eyebrows in
Beijing by negotiating a free trade pact with Taiwan, asking why the U.S. should
care so much about what Beijing thinks.</P>
      <P>Andrews said he is seeking sponsorship from other congressmen for an appeal  for
the U.S.  administration  to start free trade negotiations with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Rep. Scott Garrett echoed Andrews' view, urging his congressional colleagues  to
sponsor  the appeal  in droves  to show their determination.</P>
      <P>However, former Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific
Affairs Randall Schriver said he was not optimistic about a free trade pact
between the U.S. and Taiwan for the time being, citing the reluctance of the
U.S. Democratic administration to push for one.</P>
      <P>He suggested instead the resumption of talks with Taiwan under the Trade and
Investment Framework Agreement, which was suspended after Taiwan reneged on a
promise to allow previously banned U.S. ground beef and offal to be imported to
the island.</P>
      <P>John Tkacik, a fomer State Department official, said the problem with the trade
deal between Taiwan and China is the lack of transparency in negotiations.</P>
      <P>Citing the list of industries to enjoy the earlier tariff reduction privileges
as an example, Tkacik pointed out that the list has still not been published
even though the pact is set to be inked in June.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's government has said the full list cannot be revealed as doing so would
jeopardize Taiwan's ability to negotiate a deal that is favorable to Taiwan. The
government has said it will avoid placing on the list local industries that
would need time to adjust to competition from China.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's representative to Canada, David Tawei Lee, and his office were again
highly commended recently by an Ottawa-based foreign policy weekly for his
diplomatic clout and the office's attractions.</P>
      <P>In its latest annual "Embassy Sexy and Savvy Survey" published Wednesday,
Embassy, Canada's foreign policy newsweekly, awarded Lee's office -- the Taipei
Economic and Cultural Office in Canada, Taiwan's de facto embassy in Canada --
the title of "Embassy with Best Business Lunches."</P>
      <P>Lee himself, meanwhile, was voted by the weekly as the "second most influential
ambassador" in Canada.</P>
      <P>Lee, who has been Taiwan's representative to Canada since April 2007, attributed
the title mainly to the office's hosting of major parties such as the Taiwan
Night and the Double-Ten ROC National Day reception.</P>
      <P>He attributed the success of those activities to the support extended by the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Taipei and the hard work carried out by his
staff.</P>
      <P>It was the fourth survey of its kind conducted by the magazine. In the previous
three, Lee was voted the "hardest working ambassador" and the "second most
influential ambassador, " and was ranked third in the category of "ambassador
with the best inside scoop on Canadian politics."</P>
      <P>His office has also previously won the title of "Embassy with Best Food at
Receptions."</P>
      <P>Embassy, published every Wednesday, has a circulation of around 70,000. It is
considered an important publication in Canada's diplomatic circles and a "must
read" for Canadian public officers, parliamentarians and think-tank experts.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Second-generation NHI premiums to be 2.57-3.06 percent: minister</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Department of Health (DOH) Minister Yaung Chih-liang said Thursday that premium
rates for a second-generation National Health Insurance (NHI) program based on
total household income will be between 2.57 percent and 3.06 percent.</P>
      <P>This was the first time that the DOH revealed details of the proposed second-
generation NHI program, which is expected to be introduced within two years. In
early April, Yaung said the premiums will be between 3 percent and 4 percent.</P>
      <P>At a legislative committee meeting, Yaung presented 16 versions of plans for the
second-generation program. Yaung said, however, that under any of the versions,
about 60 percent of households will enjoy lower health insurance premium rates,
with 40 percent of singles paying lower rates.</P>
      <P>The proposal's lowest premium rate -- for total household income of at least
NT$150,000 -- is 2.57 percent. Yaung said the rate couldn't be lower because the
government is required to pay for 30 percent of total medical expenses and no
reserve fund is allocated.</P>
      <P>Under the lowest premium rate, Yaung said, households earning less than
NT$150,000 a year will pay a monthly fee of around NT$300 per person.</P>
      <P>If total household income exceeds the upper limit of NT$7.5 million, each person
in the household will pay NT$16,062 per month.</P>
      <P>Yaung  said  the second-generation  plan  improves  on the first-generation
program, and that it is expected to last for 15 to 20 years.</P>
      <P>Before the second-generation plan is introduced, a temporary plan that took
effect on April 1 raised the health insurance premium rate to between 4.55
percent to 5.17 percent of an individual's salary.</P>
      <P>As of the end of last year, the national health insurance program had
accumulated debts of NT$58.8 billion, an amount officials said could soar to an
estimated NT$101.5 billion by the end of 2010 if no adjustments are made.</P>

      <P>In response to a noticeable fall in the local currency a day earlier on the
foreign exchange market, the central bank denied speculation Thursday that it
had interfered in the market, despite its efforts to stem the influx of hot
money.</P>
      <P>"The value of the New Taiwan dollar is decided by market forces and the central
bank did not interfere to make it weaker, " Central Bank Deputy Governor Chou
A-ting told a legislative committee meeting.</P>
      <P>"After talking with several foreign institutional investors, we found that the
influx of speculative money had slowed down and more than NT$300 billion in
funds remitted into Taiwan is currently deposited in local banks," Chou said.</P>
      <P>As to the question of whether Taiwanese companies have also been lining up to
speculate on a rising local currency, he promised that the central bank will
closely monitor the situation.</P>
      <P>In a bid to ease a noticeable influx of hot money into Taiwan, the central bank
has been monitoring the movement of foreign institutional investors since the
beginning of this year. Some 20 of them have been named by the bank on its
"watch list."</P>
      <P>Central Bank Governor Peng Fai-nan has repeatedly asked foreign institutional
investors to buy Taiwanese shares or take their idle money out of Taiwan in an
effort to prevent them from taking advantage of an appreciating local currency

      <P>Taiwan and Australia signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) Thursday for
cooperation in the area of oceanographic research, the National Science Council
(NSC) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The MOU was signed at the headquarters of the Australian Institute of Marine
Science (AIMS) in Townsville, Queensland on the northeastern coast of Australia
by NSC Vice Minister Chang Wen-chuang and Ian Poiner, a chief executive of the
Australian institute, on behalf of the two sides, the NSC said in a press
statement.</P>
      <P>The two sides have agreed to promote exchanges of research staff, to co-sponsor
strategic seminars and conduct of joint research programs and they look forward
to achieving breakthroughs  in oceanographic  research  through  various
cooperative  projects, according to the NSC.</P>
      <P>Poiner was quoted as having said at the signing ceremony that international
cooperation is critical to unveiling the mysteries of marine life.</P>
      <P>He noted that the AIMS is strong in several core research fields such as marine
biodiversity, aquaculture of tropical crustacean species, water quality and
ecological health, and climate change and its effects on marine ecology.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese research fellows are welcome to conduct joint research projects with
their AIMS peers and to utilize the AIMS' world-class research facilities, he
added.</P>
      <P>Echoing Poiner's views, the NSC said that although oceans cover 70 percent of
the surface of the Earth, there is far less research and knowledge pertaining to
the sea than to the land.</P>
      <P>As 64 percent of oceans around the world are open seas outside of national
boundaries, the NSC said, international cooperation is necessary for marine
research.</P>
      <P>"We hope the cooperative programs with the Australian institute will produce
remarkable results," the NSC said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A biotechnology company in Taiwan said Thursday that it has helped a local woman
who carries the hemophilia gene to conceive a baby who will not suffer from
hemophilia -- a genetic disease that makes bleeding uncontrollable -- and hailed
it as the first case in Asia.</P>
      <P>"Women often choose abortion after finding out that they have a baby with
hemophilia, which is painful for them, both physically and psychologically,"
Joanna Teng, the manager of Bionet Corp., said at a press briefing.</P>
      <P>The woman, whose name was not revealed, had lost four sons over the past 10
years, one of whom died during surgery, possibly because of hemophilia, when he
was 7 months old, while the other were aborted after being diagnosed with
hemophilia.</P>
      <P>"She did not give up despite a series of failed attempts. Now, she is having a
healthy child due in August after using an advanced biotechnology technique
called pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD)," said her doctor, Stork Lai.</P>
      <P>"The biotechnology helps find out if an embryo is free of the hemophilia gene
before the embryo is implanted in the womb, " he told reporters.</P>
      <P>At the press briefing, Lai donated NT$1 million (about US$32,000) he received
from the woman's husband as a gift to benefit more of those in Taiwan who fear
having a hemophiliac baby.</P>
      <P>The donation will go to Genesis Genetics Asia (GGA), a subsidiary of Bionet that
offers the biotechnology. The donation is expected to benefit 15 people, each of
whom will receive a subsidy of NT$75,000 that will pay for the biotechnology to
screen out the hemophilia gene.</P>
      <P>"The biotechnology is expensive and we hope the government can also provide
funds to better cover the expenses, " said Jacky Liao, head of Hemophiliacs'
Rights Taiwan, a body dedicated to the welfare of hemophiliacs.</P>
      <P>There are more than 900 hemophiliacs in Taiwan, many of whom want to have
children, he added.</P>
      <P>Hemophiliacs are the top receivers of government subsidies for their disease
expenses under Taiwan's national health program, according to government figures
released in March.</P>
      <P>The PGD technology, which was invented by U.S. doctor Mark Hughes in 1990, has
helped some 5,000 cases in the United States and Europe, covering hemophilia and
nearly 200 other hereditary  diseases, according to GGA.</P>
      <P>Bionet sought to obtain the biotechnology eight years ago, but did not get
authorization for the Asian region until 2008 after beating competitors from
Malaysia, Japan and China, said Chris Tsai, the company's chairman.</P>
      <P>Bionet established GGA in late 2008 as a joint venture with Hughes' Genesis
Genetics Institute.</P>
      <P>A number of hospitals in Taiwan have recently announced that they have developed
and applied similar biotechnologies for those who suffer from various other
genetic diseases.</P>

      <P>A Chinese official expressed gratitude to Taiwan's Red Cross Society Thursday
for its help in rebuilding  public health facilities  damaged in a devastating
earthquake that struck China's Sichuan Province in May 2008.</P>
      <P>Wang Pohua, head of the Wuhou public health center in Mian County in Shaanxi
Province in northwestern China, expressed thanks to Wang Ching-feng, vice
president of the Red Cross Society of the Republic of China, who is visiting
China to review various post-earthquake reconstruction projects financed by the
charity.</P>
      <P>The Red Cross Society decided to help rebuild 15 healthcare centers, including a
rural health station, in Mian County in the aftermath of a magnitude-7.9
earthquake that was centered in Sichuan and affected parts of neighboring
Shaanxi Province.</P>
      <P>Because of the wide urban-rural gap in public health conditions and a lack of
health consciousness among many local residents, the reconstruction process had
many twists and turns, according to Wang Ching-feng. It took much hard work and
coordination to complete the project, she added.</P>
      <P>In an interview with the Central News Agency, Wang Pohua said that the new Wuhou
healthcare center not only offers basic healthcare services to local residents,
but also provides epidemic prevention and health education.</P>
      <P>"The local people are very grateful for Taiwan's generous effort to rebuild our
public healthcare system that now offers much better services than before the
earthquake," he added.</P>
      <P>On Tuesday, the Taiwan Red Cross Society delegation headed by Wang Ching-feng
visited Yifu Elementary School in Mian County which was rebuilt also with funds
from the charity. Wang, who once served as Taiwan's minister of justice,
presented scholarships to students in need during the visit.</P>

      <P>Taiwanese artist Heidi Huang debuted 20 of her paintings at the Red House in
Taipei for the first time recently.</P>
      <P>The 28-year old's exhibit covers three themes -- figures, animals and plants --
and will run through June 27.</P>
      <P>In all her paintings, there is a cute little rabbit called "Heidi Doll" which
appears. Huang also designs and makes by hand rabbi bags, key chains, pillows
and many other products.</P>
      <P>"Creation of this doll actually is inspired by a thought I had that I want to
comfort people, so I use my own image to create the doll," she told the Central
News Agency Thursday.</P>
      <P>Huang has wanted to be a painter from the time she was in kindergarten.</P>
      <P>"I have never changed my mind,"she said.</P>
      <P>After graduating from National Taiwan University of Arts, Huang worked as an
arts editor at a company, but she was not happy then. She later bravely decided
to follow her own path -- making creative works in the field of art.</P>
      <P>But the road she has chosen is not easy.</P>
      <P>"I used to take a simple briefcase to show my works on the street in front of
the Eslite Dun-nan (book) store, or in an arts fair, " Huang said.</P>
      <P>Now, she is happy to have a small booth showing her works at the Red House.</P>
      <P>Actually, Huang already has many fans from different countries. She revealed
that people from Hong Kong and Singapore love her rabbit products, while
tourists from the West prefer her paintings.</P>
      <P>"Painting and making creative products are my life," Huang said.</P>
      <P>She added that she was inspired by this opportunity of being able to exhibit her
works at the historical building, and said that she will keep working hard and
plans to write picture books in the future.</P>
      <P>She will also take her creations to Japan where she will present them at the
International Design Festival on May 15-16 and share her paintings and
handicrafts with artists from other countries.</P>
      <P>"I hope to communicate with young artists from all over the world through this
opportunity," Huang said.</P>

      <P>The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) said Thursday that the proposed economic
cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) with China is purely an economic issue
that has nothing to do with politics.</P>
      <P>MAC Vice Chairman Liu Te-shun made the comment following China's Taiwan Affairs
Office Director Wang Yi's mention of the so-called "1992 Consensus" at a cross-
Taiwan Strait entrepreneurs summit in the Chinese city of Nanjing.</P>
      <P>Addressing the opening ceremony of the summit earlier that day, Wang said that
both China and Taiwan should continue to consolidate a key political foundation
of opposing Taiwan's independence and supporting the "1992 Consensus" -- which
will serve as a sustainable and reliable political guarantee for developing
economic cooperation between the two sides.</P>
      <P>Liu responded at a press conference that there has been nothing -- either in
ECFA discussions or within the content of the ECFA -- related to any political
appeal.</P>
      <P>Liu said that it's understandable that Chinese officials need to make statements
in line with their political positions, but added that as both sides have their
own political  viewpoints  and directions, he also hopes that China can show
empathy toward Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The "1992 Consensus" refers to an understanding the ruling Kuomintang claims was
reached in Hong Kong in 1992 between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait that
there is only one China, but with both sides free to make their own
interpretations of what "one China" actually means.</P>

      <P>An official of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) said
Thursday that the debt crisis in Greece is having a "very limited" impact on

      <P>Schepers was in Taipei for a meeting with representatives of Taiwan's central

      <P>Labor rights activists renewed their call Thursday for wage earners around the
country to take to the streets this weekend to protest declining wages and the
rising prevalence of dispatch work.</P>
      <P>Representatives of various labor rights groups, including the Taiwan
Confederation of Trade Unions (TCTU) , made the appeal in a news conference held
in front of the Council of Labor Affairs. It marked the third time in the past
two weeks that labor rights groups have appealed for like-minded activists to
take part in the May 1 protest march to mark Labor Day.</P>
      <P>Huang Yu-teh, spokesman for a labor alliance against poverty, said the appeals
against poverty and dispatch work have won the support of many workers, both
blue collar and white collar.</P>
      <P>"We believe more than 10,000 people will turn out for the anti-poverty parade
this weekend," Huang said.</P>
      <P>The demonstrators will march from Liberty Square at the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial
Hall complex on Taipei's Zhongshan South Road to the intersection of Zhongshan
South Road and Zhongxiao West Road near the Executive Yuan to voice their
appeals, Huang said.</P>
      <P>The protest march will focus on four appeals -- "fighting poverty and forbidding
dispatched work," "labor union autonomy, " "labor participation in and
democratic supervision of ECFA, " and "allowing all wage earners to receive
monthly pensions," he added.</P>
      <P>Dispatched workers refer to those who work for manpower agencies and are
"dispatched" full-time to companies on a contract basis.</P>
      <P>Some companies prefer this arrangement because of the flexibility it gives them
in managing their work forces and because they do not have to pay benefits or
severance to the contract workers.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A 32-member fraud ring operating across the Taiwan Strait has been uncovered
through joint efforts by law enforcement units on the two sides of the strait,
Kaohsiung city police announced Thursday.</P>
      <P>Thirteen suspects were arrested in Taiwan,  including  the mastermind, surnamed
Yeh, along with account books, computers, cellphones, travel documents and
remittance records that were used to commit the fraud.</P>
      <P>Earlier that same day, 19 accomplices were also detained in a raid carried out
by Chinese public security agents in China.</P>
      <P>According to the Kaohsiung police authorities, the criminal group had made about
NT$500 million (US$15.87 million) over the past six months by posing as
personnel of Chinese telephone companies or public security authorities to cheat
people on both sides of the strait.</P>
      <P>The public security authorities in Quanzhou City in China's Fujian Province
first received complaints from local residents and passed the information to the
Taiwanese authorities in line with a cross-strait cooperation mechanism that was
established by the two sides to crack down on rampant cross-strait fraud.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taiwan's Ministry of the Interior (MOI) reported that 4,837 attempted
telephone fraud cases have been successfully thwarted over the past six years
thanks to an exclusive anti-fraud telephone line under its jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>"As much as NT$657.69 million in potentially swindled money was secured thanks
to the help of the anti-fraud unit during the six-year period, " Chiu Feng-
kuang, deputy chief of the Criminal Investigation Bureau under the MOI's
National Policy Agency, reported in a news conference.</P>
      <P>Between the start of this year and April 27, 422 attempted fraud incidents were
stymied by the anti-fraud unit, he elaborated.</P>
      <P>Although the MOI's anti-fraud line workers took around 3.27 million inquiries
from members of the public questioning whether they had been targeted by a fraud
ring, more than NT$8.8 billion was still raked in by con artists working various
telephone scams, he reported.</P>
      <P>According to Chiu, the public are very easily taken in by scamsters if they
claim to be law enforcement personnel, such as judges, prosecutors,
investigation agents or police.</P>

      <P>Taiwan and Australia signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) Thursday for
cooperation in the area of oceanographic research, the National Science Council
(NSC) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The MOU was signed at the headquarters of the Australian Institute of Marine
Science (AIMS) in Townsville, Queensland on the northeastern coast of Australia
by NSC Vice Minister Chang Wen-chuang and Ian Poiner, a chief executive of the
Australian institute, on behalf of the two sides, the NSC said in a press
statement.</P>
      <P>The two sides have agreed to promote exchanges of research staff, to co-sponsor
strategic seminars and conduct of joint research programs and they look forward
to achieving breakthroughs  in oceanographic  research  through  various
cooperative  projects, according to the NSC.</P>
      <P>Poiner was quoted as having said at the signing ceremony that international
cooperation is critical to unveiling the mysteries of marine life.</P>
      <P>He noted that the AIMS is strong in several core research fields such as marine
biodiversity, aquaculture of tropical crustacean species, water quality and
ecological health, and climate change and its effects on marine ecology.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese research fellows are welcome to conduct joint research projects with
their AIMS peers and to utilize the AIMS' world-class research facilities, he
added.</P>
      <P>Echoing Poiner's views, the NSC said that although oceans cover 70 percent of
the surface of the Earth, there is far less research and knowledge pertaining to
the sea than to the land.</P>
      <P>As 64 percent of oceans around the world are open seas outside of national
boundaries, the NSC said, international cooperation is necessary for marine
research.</P>
      <P>"We hope the cooperative programs with the Australian institute will produce
remarkable results," the NSC said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Firm helps hemophilia carrier have healthy child</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A biotechnology company in Taiwan said Thursday that it has helped a local woman
who carries the hemophilia gene to conceive a baby who will not suffer from
hemophilia -- a genetic disease that makes bleeding uncontrollable -- and hailed
it as the first case in Asia.</P>
      <P>"Women often choose abortion after finding out that they have a baby with
hemophilia, which is painful for them, both physically and psychologically,"
Joanna Teng, the manager of Bionet Corp., said at a press briefing.</P>
      <P>The woman, whose name was not revealed, had lost four sons over the past 10
years, one of whom died during surgery, possibly because of hemophilia, when he
was 7 months old, while the other were aborted after being diagnosed with
hemophilia.</P>
      <P>"She did not give up despite a series of failed attempts. Now, she is having a
healthy child due in August after using an advanced biotechnology technique
called pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD)," said her doctor, Stork Lai.</P>
      <P>"The biotechnology helps find out if an embryo is free of the hemophilia gene
before the embryo is implanted in the womb, " he told reporters.</P>
      <P>At the press briefing, Lai donated NT$1 million (about US$32,000) he received
from the woman's husband as a gift to benefit more of those in Taiwan who fear
having a hemophiliac baby.</P>
      <P>The donation will go to Genesis Genetics Asia (GGA), a subsidiary of Bionet that
offers the biotechnology. The donation is expected to benefit 15 people, each of
whom will receive a subsidy of NT$75,000 that will pay for the biotechnology to
screen out the hemophilia gene.</P>
      <P>"The biotechnology is expensive and we hope the government can also provide
funds to better cover the expenses, " said Jacky Liao, head of Hemophiliacs'
Rights Taiwan, a body dedicated to the welfare of hemophiliacs.</P>
      <P>There are more than 900 hemophiliacs in Taiwan, many of whom want to have
children, he added.</P>
      <P>Hemophiliacs are the top receivers of government subsidies for their disease
expenses under Taiwan's national health program, according to government figures
released in March.</P>
      <P>The PGD technology, which was invented by U.S. doctor Mark Hughes in 1990, has
helped some 5,000 cases in the United States and Europe, covering hemophilia and
nearly 200 other hereditary  diseases, according to GGA.</P>
      <P>Bionet sought to obtain the biotechnology eight years ago, but did not get
authorization for the Asian region until 2008 after beating competitors from
Malaysia, Japan and China, said Chris Tsai, the company's chairman.</P>
      <P>Bionet established GGA in late 2008 as a joint venture with Hughes' Genesis
Genetics Institute.</P>
      <P>A number of hospitals in Taiwan have recently announced that they have developed
and applied similar biotechnologies for those who suffer from various other
genetic diseases.</P>

      <P>A Chinese official expressed gratitude to Taiwan's Red Cross Society Thursday
for its help in rebuilding  public health facilities  damaged in a devastating
earthquake that struck China's Sichuan Province in May 2008.</P>
      <P>Wang Pohua, head of the Wuhou public health center in Mian County in Shaanxi
Province in northwestern China, expressed thanks to Wang Ching-feng, vice
president of the Red Cross Society of the Republic of China, who is visiting
China to review various post-earthquake reconstruction projects financed by the
charity.</P>
      <P>The Red Cross Society decided to help rebuild 15 healthcare centers, including a
rural health station, in Mian County in the aftermath of a magnitude-7.9
earthquake that was centered in Sichuan and affected parts of neighboring
Shaanxi Province.</P>
      <P>Because of the wide urban-rural gap in public health conditions and a lack of
health consciousness among many local residents, the reconstruction process had
many twists and turns, according to Wang Ching-feng. It took much hard work and
coordination to complete the project, she added.</P>
      <P>In an interview with the Central News Agency, Wang Pohua said that the new Wuhou
healthcare center not only offers basic healthcare services to local residents,
but also provides epidemic prevention and health education.</P>
      <P>"The local people are very grateful for Taiwan's generous effort to rebuild our
public healthcare system that now offers much better services than before the
earthquake," he added.</P>
      <P>On Tuesday, the Taiwan Red Cross Society delegation headed by Wang Ching-feng
visited Yifu Elementary School in Mian County which was rebuilt also with funds
from the charity. Wang, who once served as Taiwan's minister of justice,
presented scholarships to students in need during the visit.</P>

Hall complex on Taipei's Zhongshan South Road to the intersection of Zhongshan
South Road and Zhongxiao West Road near the Executive Yuan to voice their
appeals, Huang said.</P>
      <P>The protest march will focus on four appeals -- "fighting poverty and forbidding
dispatched work," "labor union autonomy, " "labor participation in and
democratic supervision of ECFA, " and "allowing all wage earners to receive
monthly pensions," he added.</P>
      <P>Dispatched workers refer to those who work for manpower agencies and are
"dispatched" full-time to companies on a contract basis.</P>
      <P>Some companies prefer this arrangement because of the flexibility it gives them
in managing their work forces and because they do not have to pay benefits or
severance to the contract workers.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Cross-strait fraud ring smashed</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A 32-member fraud ring operating across the Taiwan Strait has been uncovered
through joint efforts by law enforcement units on the two sides of the strait,
Kaohsiung city police announced Thursday.</P>
      <P>Thirteen suspects were arrested in Taiwan,  including  the mastermind, surnamed
Yeh, along with account books, computers, cellphones, travel documents and
remittance records that were used to commit the fraud.</P>
      <P>Earlier that same day, 19 accomplices were also detained in a raid carried out
by Chinese public security agents in China.</P>
      <P>According to the Kaohsiung police authorities, the criminal group had made about
NT$500 million (US$15.87 million) over the past six months by posing as
personnel of Chinese telephone companies or public security authorities to cheat
people on both sides of the strait.</P>
      <P>The public security authorities in Quanzhou City in China's Fujian Province
first received complaints from local residents and passed the information to the
Taiwanese authorities in line with a cross-strait cooperation mechanism that was
established by the two sides to crack down on rampant cross-strait fraud.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taiwan's Ministry of the Interior (MOI) reported that 4,837 attempted
telephone fraud cases have been successfully thwarted over the past six years
thanks to an exclusive anti-fraud telephone line under its jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>"As much as NT$657.69 million in potentially swindled money was secured thanks
to the help of the anti-fraud unit during the six-year period, " Chiu Feng-
kuang, deputy chief of the Criminal Investigation Bureau under the MOI's
National Policy Agency, reported in a news conference.</P>
      <P>Between the start of this year and April 27, 422 attempted fraud incidents were
stymied by the anti-fraud unit, he elaborated.</P>
      <P>Although the MOI's anti-fraud line workers took around 3.27 million inquiries
from members of the public questioning whether they had been targeted by a fraud
ring, more than NT$8.8 billion was still raked in by con artists working various
telephone scams, he reported.</P>
      <P>According to Chiu, the public are very easily taken in by scamsters if they
claim to be law enforcement personnel, such as judges, prosecutors,
investigation agents or police.</P>

      <P>Eleven Taiwanese banks and financial service houses have applied to venture into
China since a law liberalizing local investment in China was enacted April 19,
the Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) said Friday.</P>
      <P>Of the 11 firms, six are publicly owned banks who applied to establish branches
in China -- Taiwan Cooperative Bank, First Commercial Bank, Land Bank of Taiwan,
Chang Hwa Bank, Cathay United Bank and Hua Nan Commercial Bank.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the publicly owned Medium Business Bank of Taiwan applied to set up a
representative office in China, according to the FSC,  while ChinaTrust
Commercial Bank applied to establish a subsidiary and First Financial Holding, a
securities firm, registered to set up a representative office.</P>
      <P>Two investment and trust firms -- Fuh Hwa Investment Trust and Polaris
Investment Trust -- also applied to set up representative offices, according to
the FSC.</P>
      <P>The Taiwanese financial service firms filed the China-bound investment
applications after amendments to three revised statutes governing the operations
of banks, insurance companies and securities houses were enacted, which paved
the way for such companies to file applications to break into China.</P>
      <P>After the FSC gave the green light to the Taiwanese banks and firms, FSC
Chairman Sean Chen said, it would take another four to six months for the
Chinese authorities to process the applications before granting licenses.</P>
      <P>"I'm afraid that it will be the end of the year at the earliest before Taiwanese
banks will be able to formally venture into China, " Chen said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Banking Bureau Director Kuei Hsien-nung said the screening and
supervising of Chinese banks making inroads into Taiwan will be a "dual track"
mechanism, with the FSC and the Investment Commission under the Ministry of
Economic Affairs in charge of the issue.</P>
      <P>So far, no Chinese banks or financial service firms have submitted applications

      <P>Taiwan's freedom of the press world ranking has declined slightly, but its level
of media freedom has not shown any significant change over the past year, a
Freedom House report released Thursday said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan ranked 47th on the U.S.-based human rights watchdog body's 2010 global
press freedom rating, which was based on the findings of a survey on the media
situations in 196 countries and territories around the world in 2009.</P>
      <P>Taiwan dropped four notches from its ranking of a year ago, but Freedom House
said Taiwan's media freedom status did not show any significant changes or
numerical shifts in 2009.</P>
      <P>According to Freedom House's Freedom of the Press Index, Taiwan's scores on its
legal environment and political environment for the media remained the same at 7
and 9, respectively, while its score on the economic environment increased one

    <HEADLINE>Kuomintang claims ownership of slush fund</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 30 (CNA)
04/30/10  12:08:26
(By Lee Shu-hua and Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Kuomintang (KMT) has claimed ownership of a slush fund of NT$240
million (US$7.65 million) two days after the frozen money was collected from the
court by James Soong, chairman of the now-marginalized People First Party.</P>
      <P>KMT spokesman Su Jun-pin told a news conference Thursday that the KMT decided
from Soong's previous public accounts that the funds belong to the KMT and Soong
had intended to return the cash to the party.</P>
      <P>"James Soong should explain publicly, with evidence, if he now thinks
otherwise," Su said.</P>
      <P>"The Kuomintang will deal with the issue carefully and with total transparency
to avoid any damage to its image," Su went on.</P>
      <P>He said the funds will be donated to public interest projects if they are
returned to the KMT.</P>
      <P>In order to verify the party's claims, Su cited Soong as disputing an order for
him to pay tax on the funds at a public rally in Nanao, Yilan County in 2002, on
the grounds that the money, accumulated by Soong during his term as KMT
secretary-general between 1989 and 1993, belonged to the KMT and that he
therefore should not be asked to pay tax on it.</P>
      <P>The funds came to light in 1999 when Soong fell foul of then-President Lee Teng-
hui, who doubled as KMT chairman from 1988 to 2000, over his bid to run for the
presidency against Lee's hand-picked KMT candidate, Lien Chan.</P>
      <P>Soong, who was engaged in a three-way presidential race at the time, told a news
conference Dec. 14, 1999 that the funds were entrusted to him by Lee for party
use during Soong's term as KMT secretary-general.</P>
      <P>Soong did not hand over the money to his successor when he left his KMT post to
take over as Taiwan provincial governor in 1994.</P>
      <P>Lee denied that he had any previous knowledge of the funds, much less entrusted
it to Soong.</P>
      <P>In order to show he had no intention of embezzling the money, Soong deposited
the funds with the court Jan. 25, 2000, with Lee as the receiver, after Lee
rejected Soong's offer to return the money to the KMT.</P>
      <P>The KMT filed a complaint with the prosecution against Soong on Feb. 16, 2000,
accusing him of siphoning off NT$360 million from the party coffers.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors decided not to indict Soong after finding no evidence to support
the KMT's complaint and closed the case Jan. 17, 2005.</P>
      <P>The case made headlines again Wednesday after an attorney collected the funds
from the court on behalf of Soong earlier this month.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou, who also serves as KMT chairman, decided to deal with
the issue fairly rather than turning a blind eye to it.</P>
      <P>One of his close aides said that whoever lays claim to the funds -- Soong or Lee
-- should verify his claim with evidence, or the funds should go to the KMT.</P>
      <P>"We are compelled to deal with the issue, and must show our hand," the aide said
on condition of anonymity.</P>
      <P>However, Soong, who was on a private trip to Shanghai, told reporters Friday
that the KMT should not be washing its dirty linen in public.</P>
      <P>His attorney, Huang Shan-shan, who was holding the funds on Soong's behalf, said
Thursday in Taipei that she was surprised by the KMT's claim of ownership.</P>
      <P>Noting that during an investigation into the case the party denied having
entrusted any funds to Soong, did not claim ownership and did not try to collect
the money over the last decade, Huang questioned how the party could now demand
the money.</P>
      <P>Soong and Lee, who fell out during the 2000 presidential election, reconciled
only recently, evidenced by Lee's consent for Soong to collect the funds from
the court.</P>

    <HEADLINE>United Daily News: City makeover worth a lift</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>04/30/10  12:28:14
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taipei city government has encouraged the rebuilding of low-to-mid-rise
residential buildings in the city that are 30 years or more old through
financial and technical assistance programs. The move, however, has drawn
questions and criticism from the Ministry of the Interior and lawmakers.</P>
      <P>The critics have expressed doubts that the city government's plan can work and
have claimed that it could, on the contrary, fuel the surging residential
housing prices, which are already too high.</P>
      <P>However, the plan is an innovative move that has imagination and guts, given the
fact that under a free and democratic system, urban renewal in Taiwan is a
complicated,  constantly  changing and hard-to-control process.</P>
      <P>The makeover plan is worthy of support from the points of view of improving the
capital city's overall look and elevating the quality of living for residents.</P>
      <P>Taipei is a rather unattractive  city compared with other metropolises around
the world. The numerous old residential buildings -- many of them built in the
same period of time to a uniform design -- not only make the city look tired,
but the outdated road system and utilities also prevent its residents from
enjoying a quality of life equal to those in other modern cities.</P>
      <P>The city government's  makeover plan is worthy of central government
encouragement and support, as the plan will provide residents with an
opportunity to renovate their own residences, help facilitate a facelift for the
run down-looking metropolis, and indirectly help arrest the spiralling housing
prices.</P>
      <P>Better late than never, but if the plan is procrastinated over for too long, it
will be too late for the city to rejuvenate itself. (April 30, 2010).</P>

    <HEADLINE>Talk of the day -- Housing market shows no signs of cooling</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>04/30/10  14:02:36
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Despite recent measures taken by the government to try to cool the overheated
housing market, it seems that the efforts are producing few results.</P>
      <P>According to the latest issue of real estate monthly magazine My Housing, realty
developers are set to roll out presold housing projects totaling NT$158.6
billion in value in the northern part of Taiwan between May 15 and June 15 --
boom season for the country's housing market.</P>
      <P>The volume represents a 140 percent increase from the same period of last year
and a rise of 34 percent compared to the time prior to the outbreak of the
global financial crisis.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  a realty  index  released  Thursday  by Cathay Construction Co.
reveals that housing prices around Taiwan have been rising for three consecutive
quarters. The average transaction price for presold housing projects in Q1 2010
reached NT$190,700 per ping (one ping equals 3.3 square meters) , up 2.86
percent from the previous quarter.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from local leading newspapers' reports on the issue.</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>Chang Chin-oh, a professor at National Chengchi University's Department of Land
Economics, said it is a "very strange" phenomenon that the housing market is
demonstrating a V-shaped recovery when there has not been a significant upswing
in the country's overall economy and national income.</P>
      <P>This shows the soaring housing prices lack fundamental support and are the
result of excessive liquidity, Chang said, describing the increase as "a
temporary rebound amid a downturn."</P>
      <P>He said the outlook for the housing market will depend on factors such as
changes in liquidity supply and demand, the central bank's monetary policy and
measures taken by the government in reaction to public outrage over the
skyrocketing housing prices. (April 30, 2010).</P>
      <P>Economic Daily News:</P>
      <P>Ni Tzu-jen, chief R&amp;D officer of My Housing, predicted that housing prices
in premium areas of greater Taipei will continue to rise due to a limited supply
of land available  for housing development, when these areas are the main target
of Chinese and foreign investors seeking to make real estate purchases in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chang Ding-shuan, an associate professor in Jin Wen University of Science and
Technology's Department of Finance, cautioned that there are signs that the
market mechanism is out of order as a result of a monopoly on land resources and
strong demand for investment targets that are depreciation-resistant. (April 30,
2010).</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>Despite the central bank's attempts to stop domestic banks from wooing loan
customers with low interest rates, some of the local banks, faced with a
liquidity glut, have dropped their interest rates for construction loans to 1.2
percent and even 0.9 percent.</P>
      <P>Statistics compiled by the central bank show that as of the end of March,
outstanding construction loans had topped NT$1 trillion, up NT$24.2 billion from
the month-earlier level. The increase was the highest for the past 13 months.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, outstanding housing loans had hit a record high of nearly NT$5
trillion as of the end of March, an increase of NT$21.7 billion from the month-
earlier level. (April 30, 2010).</P>

    <HEADLINE>Acer sees challenge from HP</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>An official of Acer Inc. said Friday that he expects Hewlett-Packard (HP) to
present a strong challenge to the company after the Taiwanese computer giant
replaced its U.S. rival as the global leader in first quarter notebook computer
sales.</P>
      <P>Acer Chairman J.T. Wang said he expects HP will try hard to make a comeback by
boosting its low-priced notebook shipments in the world market in an effort to
regain its position as the world's No. 1.</P>
      <P>Citing statistics compiled by Gartner, an information technology research firm,
Wang said he was glad that Acer accounted for 19.4 percent of the global
notebook market, beating HP for the first time to grab the Q1 No. 1 title.</P>
      <P>"But the competition is far from over," Wang said, adding that as Acer's global
notebook shipments were only around 20,000 units higher than those of HP over
the past three months, it is unlikely that HP will sit on its hands.</P>
      <P>According to Gartner, Acer sold 9.49 million notebooks in Q1, up 54.5 percent
from a year earlier.</P>
      <P>"Acer had strong shipment growth across all regions, " Gartner said in a
statement.</P>
      <P>Wang said Acer is aiming to boost its sales in China, a market that is coveted
by all of the world's personal computer vendors, and has listed the China market
as the company's top marketing priority.</P>
      <P>He said his company will introduce new notebooks exclusively tailored toward
Chinese consumers by the end of this year.</P>
      <P>China accounted for 5 percent of Acer's Q1 revenue -- worth NT$162.1 billion
(US$5.1 billion) -- while Europe, the Middle East and Africa represented 50
percent, the Americas took 27 percent and the Asia-Pacific accounted for 16
percent.</P>
      <P>Acer posted NT$3.29 billion in net profits for the three-month period, up 62.6
percent from the year-earlier figure, while earnings per share hit NT$1.25,
compared with NT$0.78 recorded a year ago.</P>
      <P>Wang said he expects Acer will continue to post significant growth in the second
quarter thanks to recovering global demand for high tech products.</P>
      <P>He added that his company is also planning to launch four new smartphone models
and Internet-related products this year.</P>

      <P>With 17 inventions in the running, Taiwan is the third-largest competitor behind
Poland, with 31 entries, and China with 27.</P>
      <P>The most distinguishing characteristic of this year's contest is that most of
the entries are already on the market, said Hsu I-chuan, chief of the Taiwanese

      <P>He said that according to global statistics, only three out of every 100
inventions make it as far as commercial production.</P>
      <P>The 17 Taiwanese entries cover a wide range of categories and include a cake
knife, an ergonomic chair, an umbrella incoporating its own lighting system, an
emergency kit that can be transformed into a rope, and a tea cup that
automatically separates tea leaves from water.</P>
      <P>Other notable entries include an air cleaning system invented by Hsiao Yen-kun
that has already won numerous international prizes and is being widely applied
in the manufacture of respiratory care equipment.</P>

      <P>Nearly 200 leaders and environmental activists from home and abroad met in
Taipei Friday at the start of a regional  forum  that  highlighted  the
importance  of shared responsibility in protecting natural resources.</P>
      <P>"Our interdependence is integral to our survival. Our resources as well as our
responsibilities need to be equitably distributed in order to sustain the
quality of life for future generations, " said the Taiwanese organizers of the
Second Congress of the Asia Pacific Greens Network (APGN).</P>
      <P>The first APGN congress was held in Kyoto in 2005, days before the Kyoto
Protocol, an international agreement designed to fight global warming, entered
into force.</P>
      <P>"We have convened the second congress five years later -- five years that have
seen unprecedented growth of chaos and denial, " said Robin  Winkler,  a co-
convener  of  the  event  and  a local environmentalist, in his opening remarks.</P>
      <P>There have been "escalation of wars and military expansion, short-sighted
corporate control of more and more of the world's resources, media repression,
and all manner of social, economic and environmental abuse," he added.</P>
      <P>For his part, Australian Greens leader and Senator Bob Brown said that "we have
a big burden on our shoulders, but a warmth in our hearts and a smile on our
face. We must replace the old politics of development, consumption and greed."</P>
      <P>In his address, Pan Han-shen, the convener of the Green Party Taiwan, said he
looks forward to seeing an expansion of green parties worldwide.</P>
      <P>"There are more than 100 green party lawmakers in the Asia Pacific region and
over 1,000 worldwide, " he noted. "I hope that in the next five or 10 years,
there will be at least one green party lawmaker in every country."</P>
      <P>The APGN, which is mainly a political alliance, is hosting the three-day  event
at the Tianmu  Convention  Center,  with the participation of more than 20
nations,</P>
      <P>Tuvalu's Prime Minister Apisai Ielemia is expected to give a speech at the forum
on Saturday. Ielemia received much attention after warning at last year's
Copenhagen climate change summit that rising sea levels might submerge his
homeland.</P>
      <P>Discussions on major challenges, policies and strategies for dealing with
climate change in the Asia Pacific region will also be held during the congress.</P>
      <P>At the opening,  the participants took turns to introduce themselves  in English

dance and a traditional top-spinning ritual was presented by members of Taiwan's
Bunun Tribe.</P>
      <P>Environmentally friendly items such as bamboo cups, cotton handkerchiefs and
recycled bags are being used at the event and the organizers  have provided
bicycles as transportation  for the participants.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Memorial park honoring late Japanese engineer to open next year</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Friday that a park being built to commemorate
Japanese civil engineer Yoichi Hatta, whose work contributed greatly to the
success of an irrigation system in southern Taiwan, is slated to be inaugurated
May 8 next year.</P>
      <P>The Yoichi Hatta Memorial Park, located at Wushantou Reservoir in southern
Tainan County, will mark another milestone in the historical and cultural
exchanges between Japan and Taiwan, Ma told a group of parliamentarians from
Japan led by Yoshihide Suga, a Lower House Liberal Democrat dietman who formerly
served as a minister of internal affairs and communications.</P>
      <P>Wushantou Reservoir is the centerpiece of the Chia-Nan Irrigation System, a
flagship civil engineering project of Hatta's that was completed 80 years ago.</P>
      <P>Ma told his guests that Hatta is revered and memorialized by farmers in southern
Taiwan, where his irrigation system -- a 10,000-km water distribution system --
has played a major role in irrigating some 150,000 hectares of farmland in
Tainan and Chiayi counties since 1930 following the completion of Wushantou
Reservoir.</P>
      <P>Ma expressed hope that after the Hatta Memorial Park is completed next year, it
will become another major tourism attraction for southern  Taiwan that will help
attract tourists  from Japan, particularly those from Hatta's home town of
Kanazawa, in Ishigawa Prefecture.</P>
      <P>The president  also noted that although  formal diplomatic relations between
Taiwan and Japan were severed in 1972, bilateral exchanges have remained close.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan and Japan are closely linked, both historically and geographically, and
no countries in the world are as close as these two countries, which exchange
250 flights each week, " according to Ma.</P>
      <P>Japan is one of Taiwan's three largest trade partners and the number of Japanese
tourists that visit Taiwan tops the tourist numbers from all other countries in
the world, Ma noted.</P>
      <P>At the same time, he went on, Taiwan is also one of Japan's major sources of
tourists.</P>
      <P>Despite the close relations, however, Taiwan and Japan maintain no formal
diplomatic relations, Ma continued.</P>
      <P>"I therefore designated 2009 as the year for promoting special partnerships
between Taiwan and Japan," he said.</P>
      <P>Since then, bilateral exchanges have improved further, including the signing and
implementation of a working holiday project that benefits the youth of both
countries, the establishment of a branch office in Sapporo by Taiwan's
representative office in Tokyo, and the launch of two-way flights between
Taipei's Songshan Airport and Tokyo's Haneda Airport slated for this October, he
added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Apple Daily: National compensation in landslide disaster</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>04/30/10  17:36:15
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The families of the four people who were killed in a landslide on National
Freeway No.  3 last Sunday are entitled to national compensation. No one could
take issue with this. But as taxpayers, we are entitled  to know whether any
government  officials  were responsible for the disaster; if there were, who
they were and would they be punished for failing in their duties.</P>
      <P>Under the law, there are two types of compensation that could be claimed in such
cases. The first type is for damages as a result of negligence on the part of
government officials, and the other is for damages in the case of fault or
failure of public facilities not necessarily as a result of human error.</P>
      <P>The disaster on National Freeway No. 3 was caused by a landslide on a dip slope
that had been shaved at the base to build the freeway. This cannot be
categorized as a natural and unavoidable catastrophe over which government
officials had no control. There was no rain or storm near the slope that day
that could have triggered the landslide.</P>
      <P>In addition, the ground anchors used to retain the slope had rusted and were
therefore weak, which belies the claim by government officials that human error
was not a factor.</P>
      <P>It seems that the government is trying protect its officials by offering
compensation under the category unrelated to human error, but this would not go
down well with the public. (April 30, 2010)</P>

(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>After slashing the business income tax from 25 percent to 17 percent through the
Industrial Innovation Act, two ruling Kuomintang lawmakers  suggested
increasing  the tax rate  for businesses undistributed dividends from 10 percent
to 15 percent, or requiring businesses to distribute their dividends when they
have accumulated to half of their capital.</P>
      <P>Business profits should be subject to business tax and personal income tax when
they are distributed to individual shareholders, and business income tax should
be credited against personal income tax.</P>
      <P>When the rate for business income tax is much lower than that for personal
income tax, individual stock owners will prefer to keep their profits as
retained earnings in the company -- thereby raising its net assets and stock
prices -- and then sell their shares to transform stock earnings into stock
transaction gains.</P>
      <P>In order to close the loophole, most countries impose a tax on retained
earnings, and Taiwan follows their examples by levying a 10 percent tax in this
regard.</P>
      <P>According to one estimate, business income tax revenues used to make up a third
of the country's personal income tax takings.</P>
      <P>As we have explained above, the bigger the difference between the rate of
business income tax and the rate of personal income tax, the heavier the
influence it will exert on companies decisions on whether to retain earnings,
which will in turn affect the government's income tax revenues.</P>
      <P>This complicated issue has been discussed in detail by the tax reform commission
that was dissolved at the end of last year after mapping out a plan to
streamline the country's tax system.</P>
      <P>To address the problem triggered by the sharp cut in business income tax from 25
percent to 17 percent, the government could either increase the tax on retained
earnings or ban businesses from accumulating their earnings inappropriately.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Finance, however, should create its own options and stick to
them, and should not merely swim with the tide of public opinion. (April 30,

(By Lee Shu-hua and Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou reiterated Friday his call for an early signing of the
proposed economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) with China, an
arrangement he said is essential to ensuring an equal footing for Taiwan in
competing with other countries.</P>
      <P>Ma noted that with China having become the world's second-largest economy and
exporting country, manufacturers around the world are desperate to get a
foothold in the vast market of 1.3 billion potential customers.</P>
      <P>"This is a reality that we cannot evade, " he said while receiving a group of
worker representatives at the Presidential Office ahead of May 1 Labor Day.</P>
      <P>The ECFA is especially important to Taiwan as the country has been excluded from
free trade arrangements with most countries, a situation that has seriously
undermined Taiwan's competitiveness, Ma said.</P>
      <P>He stressed that Taiwan will not open its market to Chinese laborers under the
ECFA and said again that the government would rather give the pact up altogether
if it cannot not bring any benefits to Taiwan's overall economy.</P>
      <P>The president recalled that prior to Taiwan's accession to the World Trade
Organization in 2002, there were also widespread concerns about the entry of
cheap products from other countries that it was feared could impact local
industries.</P>
      <P>However, it was later proven that joining the WTO was favorable to Taiwan, with
the country's foreign trade volume having doubled during the seven years
following accession, he said.</P>
      <P>According to Ma, there is a consensus between Taiwan and China that the impact
of the ECFA on Taiwan's conventional industries must be kept to a minimum.</P>
      <P>In the worst case scenario, he said, the ECFA could affect 100,000 workers in 17
industries. This, however, does not mean that the workers will lose their jobs,
but it does mean that their benefits or pay might decrease, he added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislators across party lines reached a consensus Friday to reinitiate the
review of two bills that would allow Chinese students to study in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The two parties agreed that the KMT would resubmit revised versions of the draft
amendments to the University Act and the Junior College Act in early May and
that they would then be screened in committee, said Legislator Lin Yi-shih,
chief of the KMT's Central Policy Committee.</P>
      <P>The original versions of the bills, which would pave the way for local
universities and colleges to recruit Chinese students, were first reviewed by
the Education and Culture Committee on April 21.</P>
      <P>But scuffles broke out among the legislators when the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party tried to block the proceedings.</P>
      <P>Ruling Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator Chao Li-yun, who was chairing the meeting,
fainted amid the commotion after she announced that the two bills had completed
their first review and were to be referred to the full legislature for further
deliberation.</P>
      <P>A free-for-all erupted again April 26 when the opposition Democratic Progressive
Party tried to block the committee's move to confirm the minutes of the April 21
session.</P>
      <P>Despite the fierce clashes, the KMT legislative caucus asserted that the result
of the first review was valid. The DPP disagreed, saying the result of the April
21 meeting was announced by Chao as she was fainting.</P>
      <P>In a meeting to bridge their differences, Legislative Speaker Wang Jin-pyng
called on the ruling and opposition parties to make concessions on the issue
during a meeting Friday.</P>
      <P>He proposed that the two parties either recognize the validity of the first
review and negotiate on the issue further before referring it to the full
legislature or allow the committee to hold another session to review the bills
again.</P>
      <P>The two parties agreed that KMT lawmakers will submit revised amendments on May
3, and that the full legislature will approve sending them to committee on May
7, the KMT's Lin said.</P>
      <P>The new amendments will then be reviewed by the Education and Culture Committee
May 10.</P>
      <P>At the same time, the Internal Administration Committee will review draft
amendments to the Statute Governing the Relations Between the Peoples of the
Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area that would lead to the opening of local
universities and colleges to Chinese students, Lin said.</P>
      <P>The DPP promised that it will follow the rules of procedure and not resort to
violence.</P>
      <P>DPP caucus whip Lee Chun-yee said the DPP was happy to see the KMT agree to
reinitiate the review of the bills. He defended his party's blocking the
majority KMT from "railroading" bills through the legislature as an action taken
to protect the rights of Taiwan's workers.</P>
      <P>Recognition of Chinese academic credentials could lead to an exodus of Taiwanese
students to China and chaos in Taiwan's job market and would affect the
employment rights of Taiwan's students, Lee argued.</P>

hinder or block Taiwan's bid to forge free trade agreements (FTAs) with other
countries, but he did not indicate if he has received a response.</P>
      <P>"As a member of the World Trade Organization (WTO) , Taiwan is entitled to
signing the FTAs, " the president said while meeting a group of presidential
advisers on industrial affairs.</P>
      <P>China has been said to be behind Taiwan's failed attempt to reach FTA
arrangements with the world's major economic players.</P>
      <P>On the proposed economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) that his
administration hopes to sign with China in June, Ma said it is a part of
Taiwan's global economic strategy.</P>
      <P>"The ECFA is just one important step in Taiwan participating in regional
economic integration," the president said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan stands a greater chance to strike FTAs with other countries after inking
the trade pact with China, as it is expected to help Taiwan become stronger,
establish better links with other parts of the Asia Pacific region, and reshape
its global deployment.</P>
      <P>President Ma said he will personally lead a government task force to expedite
Taiwan's FTA drive.</P>
      <P>He also told his advisers that the International Monetary Fund has recently
forecast 6.5 percent economic growth for Taiwan this year, showing that the
country is doing well in reviving its economy and the government also foresees
continued improvement in the near future.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Ex-premier to step up push for referendum on ECFA</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Premier Frank Hsieh announced Friday the establishment of an action
alliance that will step up the pace of the push for a national referendum on a
proposed trade pact between Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>He said that the alliance will stage a massive rally on May 20 -- the second
anniversary of President Ma Ying-jeou's inauguration -- to highlight the call
for a referendum on the cross-strait economic cooperation framework agreement
(ECFA).</P>
      <P>According to Hsieh, Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen
made the case well for a referendum, during a televised debate with President Ma
on April 25, but there is not enough momentum in the drive to reject the trade
pact.</P>
      <P>If the DPP waits until June to hold a major rally against the ECFA, it will not
be able to build enough momentum to reject the deal, as the Ma administration
hopes to sign the pact with China by mid-year, Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>With this in mind, he and the eight civic groups, including the Taiwan
Association of University Professors (TAUP) and Alliance of Referendum for
Taiwan, have forged an action group to push harder and faster for the
referendum, he said.</P>
      <P>"We want to block the ECFA which is gathering steam," he added.</P>
      <P>Heish said that the two strategies of opposing the ECFA -- taking to the streets
in protest and arguing against it in the legislature -- should be integrated.</P>
      <P>To this end, in the lead up to the rally on May 20, a sit-in will be held and a
series of speeches will be given in front of Kaohsiung Arena on May 2 to inform
the public about the danger the ECFA poses to Taiwan, said a former chairman of
the Council of Labor Affairs, Lee Ying-yuan.</P>
      <P>TAUP President Chen Yi-sheng said that the series of activities are aimed at
informing the public about the importance of referendum as a tool for rejecting
the Ma administration's China policy.</P>
      <P>"Only through referendum can the people decide their own fate, " he said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A proposed economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) with China will not
be a Trojan horse as a U.S. congressional  member has reportedly said,
Presidential Office spokesman Lo Chih-chiang said Friday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a seminar organized by the pro-independence Formosan Association for
Public Affairs (FAPA) in Washington, D.C. Wednesday, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, a
Republican congresswoman from Florida, likened the deal to a Trojan horse
Beijing is using to help it annex Taiwan, according to news reports.</P>
      <P>Responding to the report, Lo said Ros-Lehtinen had misunderstood the essence of
the ECFA.</P>
      <P>As an export-oriented country, Taiwan needs to sign a free trade agreement (FTA)
with its major trading partners to ensure the free flow of merchandise and
capital, which Lo said is the only viable option to sustain Taiwan's economic
lifeline.</P>
      <P>Noting that both the United States and China are Taiwan's key trade partners, Lo
said Taiwan has been working hard to expand trade ties with both countries.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Lo said, improved cross-strait economic and trade relations will help
stabilize the Taiwan Strait situation which is in U.S. interests and is also a
direction that the U.S. government looks forward to seeing.</P>
      <P>At the briefing, Congressman Robert Andrews, a Democrat from New Jersey also
suggested that the United States should take steps to negotiate a free trade
agreement with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lo said the administration of President Ma Ying-jeou welcomed such an appeal.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, commenting on opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen's claim at an international news conference held the
previous day that the United States will be marginalized once Taiwan and China
strike the ECFA deal, Lo said Tsai's speculation was unfounded and unnecessary.</P>
      <P>"Both the U.S. government and the American Chamber of Commerce in Taipei
(AmCham) have voiced explicit support for the ECFA initiative because the deal
will not only benefit Taiwan but is also in U.S. interests," Lo said in an
interview with local news media.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the U.S. government has been positive toward the cross-strait
ECFA initiative, Lo said American Institute in Taiwan Director William A.
Stanton, who is the top U.S. representative in Taipei, has on many occasions
welcomed closer cross-strait commercial exchanges and cooperation to help
maintain regional stability and prosperity.</P>
      <P>In its 2009 white paper, Lo said, AmCham even pointed out that Taiwan would be
forced out of the vast Chinese market because of tariff disadvantages if it
cannot sign a cross-strait ECFA, a scaled-back free trade pact.</P>
      <P>Lo also reminded Tsai that AmCham once urged Taiwan's opposition camp to refrain
from politicizing or complicating ECFA issues for the sake of Taiwan's overall
economic interests.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) is
considering the feasibility of extending the Danshui MRT line to Danhai New Town
to help accelerate the community's development, the CEPD said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The planned elevated Danhai line, a medium-capacity light rail transit system
(LRT) , would run from Hongshulin Station on the existing  Danshui line to
Danhai New Town and allow the new community's residents to get to Taipei Main
Station in one hour.</P>
      <P>Following a meeting on the project's feasibility that also included the Ministry
of Transportation and Communications (MOTC) , CEPD Deputy Minister Hwang Wang-
hsiang said the project would contribute to the new town's development.</P>
      <P>The new community has been planned to accommodate 300,000 residents, but to
date, only 453 hectares of the community's 1,756 hectares have been developed,
largely because of the lack of convenient transportation and peripheral
services.</P>
      <P>Hwang said the line would take six to seven years to build and could also be
extended to Danshui Station and provisions existed for another spur line that
would connect Danhai New Town and Fisherman's Wharf, a popular tourist
destination at the mouth of the Danshui River.</P>
      <P>The MOTC has estimated that the line from Hongshulin Station to Danhai New Town
would cost an estimated NT$9.7 billion (US$310 million) to build. Adding a loop
line to Danshui Station would cost an additional NT$2.1 billion, an MOTC
official said.</P>
      <P>According to a local media report,  the project had been previously rejected by
the MOTC over fears that it was too expensive but that it was being revived out
of election considerations.</P>
      <P>Officials from both the CEPD and MOTC told the Central News Agency, however,
that the report was wrong on both counts.</P>
      <P>The MOTC did ask for additions to be made to an initial project plan but had not
turned it down, the MOTC official said, and its evaluation has followed a
schedule unrelated to election activities.</P>
      <P>Taipei County, which is to be upgraded to a special municipality called Xinbei
City, will elect a new mayor in late 2010.</P>
      <P>One CEPD official told CNA that the light-rail project will contribute to Danhai
New Town's development, but other supplementary measures will also be needed to
boost services and other industries to entice more people to move to the new
community.</P>
      <P>Hwang said the MOTC will include a neighborhood development plan as part of the
project, and will submit it to the CEPD for review. After it is approved by the
CEPD, it will be submitted to the Executive Yuan for final approval.</P>

      <P>Taiwanese students amassed five gold, one silver, four bronze and six honor
medals at the 11th Asia Physics Olympiad (APhO), which concluded in Taipei City
Friday.</P>
      <P>Wang Si-buo from Taipei Municipal Jianguo High School emerged as the

theory.</P>
      <P>The competition brought together 130 students from 16 countries or regions.</P>
      <P>As host, Taiwan entered two teams with a total of 16 students in the
competition. One of the teams took gold in a group event.</P>
      <P>Wang, a gold medal winner at the International Mathematical Olympiad and at the
International Olympiad in Informatics, has been granted  automatic  admission
to National  Taiwan University's Department of Electrical Engineering.</P>
      <P>Wang said that to win an award, contestants had to read extensively and
familiarize themselves with past test questions. "There is no shortcut to
success," he added.</P>
      <P>Silver medalist Hsu Nai-lun, who has been offered a place in NTU's Department of
Physics, said that mathematics and physics were his favorite subjects and that
he is deeply interested in physics because it is closely related to situations
in everyday life.</P>
      <P>Lin Min-juey, a physics professor at National Taiwan Normal University, which
was responsible for training Taiwan's students, said they would  have performed
well even if their  Chinese counterparts had participated.</P>
      <P>At last year's contest in Bangkok, China took home eight gold medals to Taiwan's
seven, with China's Lei Jin named the overall winner.</P>
      <P>China is absent from this year's competition due to "political considerations, "

      <P>The Taipei Revenue Service said Friday that it has identified 9,850 households
in the city that will be assessed a "luxury house tax, " which will increase
their housing tax burden by as much as 320 percent.</P>
      <P>Service Director Hsieh Sung-fang said the "luxury house tax" will be launched in
July 2011, after the publicly assessed house values of "luxury houses" are
adjusted upwards.</P>
      <P>The publicly assessed housing value is an estimate of a house's worth, not
including the land, made by a public agency and is used to calculate the housing
tax. Taiwan does not assess taxes on land or houses based on actual transaction
values.</P>
      <P>The city will only start benefiting from the increase when it begins collecting
the tax in May 2012. The tax is expected to add NT$800 million to the city's
revenues.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said that since Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin announced that the city would
impose a 'luxury house tax" in February, it had identified as of Friday 9,850
houses in Taipei that should be classified as "luxury houses."</P>
      <P>But due to confidentiality considerations and the safety of taxpayers, the
office will not identify the houses.</P>
      <P>He said the upwards adjustment of the publicly assessed house value was not only
based on trying to raise tax revenues but also on the principle of tax fairness.</P>

      <P>Taiwan executed four death row inmates Friday, the first time the death penalty
had been carried out in the country since December 2005.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Justice (MOJ) confirmed Friday evening that four death row
convicts, identified as Chang Chun-hung, Hung Chen-yao, Ko Shih-ming and Chang
Wen-wei, were executed earlier in the day, two days after Justice Minister Tseng
Yung-fu signed the warrants for the executions, the ministry said in a
statement.</P>
      <P>Taiwan last executed death row convicts in December 2005. The lack of executions
since then drew attention earlier this year when former Minister of Justice Wang
Ching-feng insisted on promoting the abolition of capital punishment and refused
to sign death warrants.</P>
      <P>Wang was later forced to resign March 11 amid a public outcry of victims of
violent crimes and their families.</P>
      <P>When Tseng assumed office March 22, he made it clear that while abolishing the
death penalty is an ultimate goal, he would abide by the rule of law in dealing
with issues regarding death row convicts.</P>
      <P>Following Friday's executions, Taiwan still has 40 individuals on death row.</P>
      <P>Presidential Office spokesman Lo Chih-chiang said that since Taiwan is a country
that upholds the rule of law, it must deal with death row convicts according to
existing law, unless there are reasons prescribed in the law that justify
suspending the execution.</P>
      <P>Acknowledging that scrapping the death penalty is a mainstream trend in a
majority of countries around the world, Lo said local residents remain highly
divided on the issue.</P>
      <P>Because there is still no consensus on capital punishment in Taiwan, more
rational discussion is needed before a final decision can be reached, he said.</P>
      <P>In the interim, the government will study the feasibility of extending prison
terms for certain kinds of felonies, raising thresholds for parole of those who
have been given life sentences and tightening procedures for meting out the
death peanlty.</P>
      <P>The government will also seek to cut back the use of capital punishment through
legal amendments, Lo added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said the triangular relations among Taiwan, the United
States and China are the best they have been in 60 years in an interview
broadcast on CNN Friday night Taipei time.</P>
      <P>In an interview with Christiane Amanpour that was recorded on Wednesday, Ma said
that since he was sworn in on May 2008, he has made great efforts to ease
tensions across the Taiwan Strait by inking 12 cooperative agreements with
China, successfully turning the Taiwan Strait from a flash point into a peaceful
and prosperous area in the Asia Pacific area.</P>
      <P>He stressed, however, that all of the pacts were reached without compromising
the sovereignty of the country.</P>
      <P>Questioned on whether the U.S. would continue selling weapons to Taiwan, Ma said
Taiwan needed to purchase weapons to defend itself and its democracy, and that
the U.S. has been providing Taiwan with defensive weapons in accordance with the
Taiwan Relations Act.</P>
      <P>He said arms deals are in the interests of both Taiwan and the U.S, and
Washington understands arms sales to Taiwan will help maintain stability in the
region.</P>
      <P>Amanpour early on asked Ma about domestic opposition to a proposed economic
cooperation framework agreement that Taiwan hopes to sign with China in June.</P>
      <P>He said that after his debate with an opposition leader last Sunday, support for
such a pact has increased, and that his government will continue to explain it
to the general public to solicit more support for a deal that he argued would
benefit Taiwan very much.</P>
      <P>Amanpour also questioned Ma about possible plans to meet Chinese leader Hu
Jintao, but the president said there were no such plans at present because the
time for such a meeting was not right.</P>
      <P>He said he would seek to consolidate the foundation for better cross-strait
relations  by increasing  economic,  cultural and educational exchanges between
the two sides.</P>
