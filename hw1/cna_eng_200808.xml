    <HEADLINE>One more carrier cancels flights on Taiwan's western corridor</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  July  31  (CNA)
08/01/08  10:24:13
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Domestic flight services on Taiwan's western corridor will be slashed further
after Trans Asia Airways decided to suspend all its Taipei-Kaohsiung and Taipei-
Tainan flights from Friday, due to the strong competition from the more
convenient and less expensive high-speed railway.</P>
      <P>The cancellation will leave Mandarin Airlines -- an affiliate of China Airlines,
Taiwan's largest carrier -- as the only carrier plying the route between Taipei
in northern Taiwan and Kaohsiung in the south, while the Taipei-Tainan air route
will close for good.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for Mandarin Airlines said Thursday that they will consider also
closing the Taipei-Kaohsiung route if passenger loads in August continue to make
the route a money-loser.</P>
      <P>The high-speed railway that opened in January 2007, coupled with rising crude
oil prices in the international market, are to blame for the flight service
cuts, said Mandarin Airlines Director of Public Affairs Irving Hsu,  who noted
the difficulty  of maintaining profitable flight operations on the western
corridor.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that the only profitable domestic passenger flight operations are
those serving the eastern cities of Hualien and Taitung, as well as the outlying
islands.</P>
      <P>As a result, Mandarin opened a Taipei-Taitung air route that same day and was to
begin offering flights from Taipei to the Penghu islands Friday in an effort to
balance the losses incurred on the western corridor, Hsu added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan to seek talks with China over relaxed bourse investment</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  July 31 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government will ask its quasi-official intermediary body to negotiate with
China over the signing of an agreement for a possible relaxation of rules
governing Chinese investment in Taiwan's stock market, an official said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>The remarks came after the Cabinet decided at a meeting earlier in the day to
allow qualified domestic institutional investors (QDII) from China to invest in
the Taiwan bourse from October at the earliest.</P>
      <P>At the meeting, Lai Shin-yuan, chairwoman of the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC),
Taiwan's China policy planner, described the opening policy as an important step
in capital liberalization across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>However, she cautioned that the policy will not deliver the desired results if
China does not launch related measures and sign a memorandum of understanding
(MOU) with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Without a MOU with China, Taiwan's new policy would be able to attract only 3
percent of Chinese QDII investment into the local stock market, which would
represent a combined investment of NT$33.8 billion (US$1.1 billion).</P>
      <P>Lai said the council will ask the Taipei-based Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF)
to negotiate with its Chinese counterpart, the Association for Relations Across
the Taiwan Strait, to facilitate the signing of such an agreement.</P>
      <P>The two quasi-official intermediary bodies were set up to engage in cross-strait
negotiations in the absence of diplomatic ties between the two sides.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, local securities companies said they believe the policy should help
boost Taiwan's stock market in the long run, but they also called for a full
opening to Chinese capital investment in Taiwanese stocks.</P>
      <P>Taiwan International Securities Corp. predicted that Chinese investors will
particularly want to invest in Taiwan's technology stocks, as the local high-
tech sector is globally competitive.</P>
      <P>However, the company said China's stock markets have also fallen a great deal
recently and speculated that not many Chinese investors will be willing to
invest in Taiwan in the near future.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Taipei-based Capital Securities Corp. also said that the policy
might not immediately drive up Taiwan's stock market, but still hailed the move
as a "good beginning."</P>
      <P>The company said the policy will be more effective if the MOU is inked and
Chinese investors are permitted to pour capital into Taiwan.</P>
      <P>However, Chen Po-chih, chairman of a private thinktank advocating Taiwan-centric
policies, warned that the new policy will tie Taiwan's stock market closely to
China's.</P>
      <P>Any turbulence in China's stock markets will immediately affect Taiwan's, Chen
said, describing China's stock markets as "relatively unstable."</P>
      <P>Beijing could also use its investments to achieve its political purpose --
forcing Taiwan to accept unification with China, Chen speculated.</P>
      <P>China does not have a free economy and much of the Chinese capital is controlled
by the government or state-run companies, he went on.</P>
      <P>Therefore, the Beijing authorities can dominate the decisions of more qualified
institutional investors, he said.</P>
      <P>Chen also warned that Chinese investors could intervene in Taiwanese companies'
management decisions if they control just 3 percent of the companies' shares.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan to open doors to 5 more Chinese media outlets</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Five more regional Chinese media outlets will be allowed to post journalists in
Taiwan, the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) announced Thursday.</P>
      <P>The new measure follows the council's lifting of a ban in late June on the
posting of correspondents from the two foremost Chinese national news
organizations -- the Xinhua news agency and the People's Daily newspaper.</P>
      <P>MAC Vice Chairman Liu Te-shun said the Cabinet-level MAC has already begun
accepting applications from prospective regional media outlets from all over
China, with a Sept. 30 application deadline.</P>
      <P>The new measure, Liu said, will allow Chinese journalists to stay for up to
three months per visit.</P>
      <P>Since the MAC, the country's top China policy coordinating agency, began in 2000
to open Taiwan's doors to Chinese newsmen seeking to cover events in Taiwan,
five Chinese national media organizations have been granted the green light to
post journalists in Taipei. In 2005, two Chinese regional newspapers -- the
Nanfang City News and the Xinmin Evening News -- were also permitted to post
correspondents in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In 2006, the then-Democratic Progressive Party administration revoked licenses
for Xinhua and People's Daily to post correspondents in Taipei over their biased
reports on Taiwan's reaction to China's Anti-Secession Law targeting Taiwan.</P>
      <P>With cross-Taiwan Strait relations warming up following the inauguration of the
China-friendly Kuomintang government, the MAC has decided to open the doors
wider to Chinese media outlets with an aim to promote mutual understanding.</P>
      <P>Noting that city and regional media outlets in China have consistently shown
keen interest in covering news in Taiwan, Liu said the MAC decided to further
relax the entry restrictions, adding that if the new opening measure gives
satisfactory results, the duration of stay for Chinese correspondents might also
be extended.</P>

      <P>The central government's expenditure for 2009 is budgeted at NT$1.83 trillion
(US$60 billion) , marking a 6.9 percent year-on-year increase, the Directorate
General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) reported Thursday.</P>
      <P>The increased budget will mainly be used for new economic development projects,
more social welfare services and additional spending on education, culture and
technology research, the DGBAS said in a press statement.</P>
      <P>According to the statement, Premier Liu Chao-shiuan presided over abudget
planning meeting in the morning, during which the central government's  budget
plan for the coming year was tentatively projected.</P>
      <P>As the government's 2009 tax revenues are estimated at just about NT$1.7
trillion, the statement said, the government will have to issue state bonds and
use budget surpluses accumulated in the previous years to make its ends meet.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou once again expressed welcome to China's reference to
Taiwan as "Chinese Taipei" in the Olympic Games Friday, saying that it
represents an "important development" in cross-Taiwan Strait relations.</P>
      <P>Ma said China's official media outlets have referred to Taiwan's Olympic team as
"Zhonghua Taipei" -- Chinese Taipei -- rather than "Zhongguo Taipei, "which
means "Taipei, China" in mandarin and implies that Taiwan is part of China.</P>
      <P>"It's a significant change in Beijing's stance on Taiwan and it would not have
happened if we had not made efforts to improve cross-Taiwan Strait relations
over the past two months, " Ma said to Stephen Waters,  representative of the
Australian Commerce and Industry Office in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Ma said he reiterated in his inaugural speech May 20 that cross-strait relations
will go nowhere if Taiwan continues to be isolated by China in the international
arena.</P>
      <P>"I also reiterated that China and Taiwan should cooperate and show respect to
each other in the international community, rather than locking horns in
malicious competition that are unnecessarily wasteful, " Ma told Waters during a
brief meeting at the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>Ma said he had repeated his ideas on various occasions during visits he made to
Australia two years ago that if Taiwan wants to cease meaningless competition
with China, the key should not only rely on diplomatic solutions, but also on
improving cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>"We have now started working toward that direction," Ma told Waters.</P>
      <P>He noted that after his administration pronounced a "diplomatic truce" proposal,
the idea raised the eyebrows of China, the United States and other nations
concerned about cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>As to another proposal that he has spelled out on seeking cross-strait
reconciliation in the international arena, Ma said that so far, the two sides
have not exchanged views on the issue, although there have been many discussions
on each side.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that Chinese media called Taiwan's team "Zhongguo Taipei" or
"Taipei, China" during the last two Olympics, but after his administration
expressed a firm stance on the designation issue, China's state media outlets
are now referring to Taiwan as "Zhonghua Taipei," in accordance with
International Olympic Committee protocol.</P>
      <P>"This is a positive and significant development for both Taiwan and China, as
well as for the international community," he said.</P>

      <P>Taichung Hospital has recently won the first health promotion excellence award
presented by the Taiwan Society of Health Promoting Hospitals and the Taiwan
Network of Health Promotion Hospitals and Health Services.</P>
      <P>Hsu Yung-nien the president of Taichung Hospital who received the award from
Vice President Vincent Siew in a July 27 ceremony, said the award is a great
honor for the medical facility, which was established over 115 years ago.</P>
      <P>Taichung Hospital beat out over 20 hospitals in Taiwan that participated in the
Health Promoting Hospitals program.</P>
      <P>Hsu said that one of the keys to Taichung Hospital's success is the fact that
all the doctors, nurses and administrative staff follow the principle of
"treating patients like family."</P>
      <P>In 2006, Taichung Hospital became the first hospital in central Taiwan to be
awarded an accreditation certificate from the World Health Organization
Collaborating Centre's (WHOCC's) Network of Health Promoting Hospitals and
Health Services.</P>
      <P>At last year's 1st National Conference of Health Promoting Hospitals in Taiwan
held at the Taiwan Adventist Hospital, WHOCC Director Hanne Tonnesen accredited
17 health promoting hospitals in Taiwan, bringing the number of hospitals in the
country with accreditation certificates to 22.</P>
      <P>There are currently over 600 hospitals around the world taking part in the
program.</P>
      <P>Under the program,  hospitals incorporate  health promotion concepts, values and
standards into their organizational culture and services, allowing all of a
hospital's employees and their families, patients and their families, and
residents of the community to participate in health promotion together.</P>

      <P>The average number of passengers on Taipei's Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) system
reached 1.15 million per day in July, the city government's Department of
Transportation said Friday.</P>
      <P>The figure marks an increase of 5.5 percent over the level of 1.09 million
riders per day for the same month of the previous year, according to Hung Tsang-
lang, head of the department's Planning and Development Division.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, rider numbers on Taipei City public buses stood at 1.64 million per
day for July, Hung said.</P>
      <P>Although the figure was down from the 1.67 million of the year-earlier level,
the average number of riders per day from July 16 to the present rose to 1.72
million, he added.</P>
      <P>The Taipei Rapid Transit Corp. said at a city government meeting that passenger
numbers on the Maokong cable car system have averaged 13,000 per day since its
inauguration last year, with the highest daily total reaching 32,000,
demonstrating that the system has been well-received by the public.</P>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin said that public transportation use has been rising,
largely due to the increase in fuel prices at filling stations, with many city
residents opting to leave the car at home to save money.</P>
      <P>He added that the city will continue to expand and improve public transport
services in the city, pointing out that the public's satisfaction rate with the
city's public transport system has a significant influence on the municipal

    <HEADLINE>Writer claims China's economy close to collapse</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New York,  July 31 (CNA)
08/01/08  14:48:44
(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The author of a controversial 2001 book titled "The Coming Collapse of China",
predicted Thursday that the Beijing Olympics, as China's coming-out party, has
accelerated the upside of China's economy and that it will also accelerate the
downside afterward.</P>
      <P>Speaking to some 50 international journalists and academics at the Taipei
Economic and Cultural Office in New York, Gordon Chang said that during a recent
trip to Beijing he saw gigantic infrastructure, including sports facilities, an
airport terminal and hundreds of hotels, built in Beijing for the Olympics.</P>
      <P>"Chinese dream large, but their fear is even larger," said Chang.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that in Beijing, security concerns prevail, with restrained
Internet  access and large deployments  of police, paramilitary  forces  and
volunteers  for  the Olympics.  The extraordinary security measures might not
return to normal after the Olympics, he claimed.</P>
      <P>With high inflation, the economy remains an especially difficult challenge in
the future for China, and Beijing is due for a post-Olympic recession, according
to Chang.</P>
      <P>He suggested that sponsoring the Olympics has had a positive effect on China in
the past few years, however, with an upside is bound to come a downside, and
China's economy might take a hit in the coming years, he speculated.</P>
      <P>Reaffirming predictions he made in "The Coming Collapse of China" almost a
decade ago, Chang said it is very difficult for the Communist Party of China
(CPC) to sustain its power monopoly. The regime is seeking to keep this monopoly
by enhancing nationalism and delivering economic prosperity.</P>
      <P>Chang said that from his observations, Chinese society is progressing forward
quickly, with more and more people conscious of their individual rights. On the
other hand, the system today has become more repressive, he claimed, forecasting
that the CPC will collapse.</P>
      <P>Answering a question on the warming of cross-Taiwan Strait relations, Chang said
that despite of what the leaders on both sides of the Taiwan Strait have said,
anything involving sovereignty is still a zero-sum game with no compromise.</P>
      <P>According to Chang, the next two to three years, maybe the next half-decade, is
not a time for Taiwanese to invest in China, especially in China's financial
market.</P>
      <P>Chang graduated from Cornell Law School in 1973. He lived and worked in China
and Hong Kong for almost 20 years, most recently in Shanghai as counsel to an
American law firm.</P>
      <P>In addition to contributing to such publications as The Wall Street Journal, The
New York Times, The New York Sun and The Far Eastern Economic Review, he has
appeared on CNN, BBC, Fox News Channel, CNBC, MSNBC and Bloomberg Television,
and is often invited to speak at think tanks.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Postal company restores name to `Chunghwa Post Co.'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  1 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The board of the state postal company decided Friday to restore the company's
original name -- Chunghwa Post Co. -- more than a year after it was renamed
"Taiwan Post Co." by the former pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) administration.</P>
      <P>The move was made in line with a resolution adopted in April by the ruling
Kuomintang (KMT) -dominated Legislative Yuan, which required the company to
reinstate the original name within six months, on the grounds that the name
change process was unlawful.</P>
      <P>"The company has always been referred to as `Chunghwa Post Co.' in related laws,
although it was changed to `Taiwan Post Co.' under a policy (of the former DPP
administration), " explained Chunghwa Post Chairman Wu Min-yu during a news
conference held after a board meeting.</P>
      <P>Wu said signboards at post offices nationwide will all be changed by Monday.</P>
      <P>The company adopted the name "Taiwan Post Co." in February 2007 amid a DPP-
backed campaign to change the names of state-owned enterprises that contain
references to China. "Chunghwa" means "Chinese" or "China" in the Chinese
language.</P>
      <P>Also renamed in the campaign were Chinese Petroleum Corp., which was changed to
"CPC Corp., Taiwan, " and China Shipbuilding Corp., which was changed to "CSBC
Corp., Taiwan."</P>
      <P>The DPP argued that the name change campaign would help avoid confusion
resulting from Taiwanese organizations carrying names similar to those used by
organizations in China.</P>
      <P>However, despite the name change, bills introduced by the DPP administration to
amend the Postal Service Act and a statute on the establishment of the Chunghwa
Post Co. to change the laws' references to the company were stalled by the
legislature after failing to win support from the majority KMT.</P>
      <P>Following his election victory, President Ma Ying-jeou of the KMT expressed
disapproval  for the name  change  and of the DPP administration's decision to
print "Taiwan" in Chinese and English, rather than the country's official title
"Republic of China, " on postage stamps issued by the postal company.</P>
      <P>Soon after the KMT administration's inauguration in May, the Ministry of
Transportation and Communications decided that stamps printed solely with
"Taiwan" will be issued for the last time Aug. 1 and that the issuance of stamps
printed with "Republic of China" will begin anew Aug. 20. The new print will
read "Chunghua Minkuo" in Chinese and "Republic of China (Taiwan) " in English,
according to the ministry.</P>
      <P>From Feb. 28, 2007 until Aug. 1, 2008, Taiwan Post Co. has issued a total of 33
sets of postage stamps printed with "Taiwan." As an exception, a set of stamps
issued May 20 to mark Ma's inauguration were printed with "Republic of China" at
the request of the president.</P>

      <P>After more than three years of inactivity, Taiwan's Control Yuan reopened
Friday,  with new Control Yuan President Wang Chien-shien vowing to rebuild the
prestige of the government branch and restore justice in the country.</P>
      <P>I promise that all Control Yuan members will investigate cases with only right
and wrong in mind, without the intervention of any political forces, declared
Wang at the swearing-in ceremony for him and the body's 24 other members, who
will serve six-year terms.</P>
      <P>He said the new members were determined to restore the "glory of the
institution's investigative powers" and uphold the principles of the five-power
consitution laid out by Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the founder of the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>The Control Yuan is one of Taiwan's five branches of government, responsible for
monitoring and investigating the behavior of civil servants and public
officials.</P>
      <P>Authorized to impeach, censure, and audit members of government, the Control
Yuan had been paralyzed since the previous members' terms expired on Jan. 31,
2005, when the Kuomintang-controlled legislature began a prolonged  boycott of
then-President  Chen Shui-bian's nominations of new members.</P>
      <P>The election of a new administration in March 2008 paved the way for new members
to be nominated by President Ma Ying-jeou of the KMT and confirmed by the
lawmaking body.</P>
      <P>After Friday's swearing-in ceremony presided over by Ma that was held at the
Office of the President, Control Yuan President Wang and the 24 members gathered
at the Control Yuan for the inauguration ceremony, attended by Vice President
Vincent Siew.</P>
      <P>Amid high expectations for the new members because of pervasive corruption in
the country, Wang said the Control Yuan is committed to fullilling its role of
restoring integrity to public insititutions.</P>
      <P>"Righteousness  will exalt  a nation;  only when there is righteousness can the
country be developed, said Wang, citing a passage in the Bible that he
encouraged all members to keep in mind.</P>
      <P>Wang, a devout Christian, is nicknamed "saint" for his integrity and toughness.</P>
      <P>Vice President Siew encouraged the members to transform the current state of
political ethics and raise the quality of Taiwan's democracy, so that one day
they will no longer have any cases to investigate.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>More human resources are required for the country's social welfare efforts to
provide better support for the disadvantaged, first lady Chow Mei-ching said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Chow made the remarks at a seminar held by the World Vision Taiwan charity on
the learning environment for disadvantaged children that was attended by many
representatives of non-profit groups, government officials and scholars.</P>
      <P>Chow said the country's social welfare groups have made great strides in
improving the living environment for the disadvantaged, but added that more
participation by groups and individuals is needed to help greater numbers of
people in difficulty.</P>
      <P>"Software" rather than "hardware" is more a problem in terms of helping
disadvantaged children, especially those living in remote areas, Chow said.</P>
      <P>For example, she went on, some schools that have been given computers are
allowing them to lie idle as they lack the personnel capable of teaching
computer skills to students, while one tribal community left boxes of donated
books sealed for six months as they had no-one to take care of them.</P>
      <P>This lack of human resources has created barriers to the learning opportunities
for disadvantaged children, Chow said.</P>
      <P>In addition, she went on, good social work skills should be an important
requirement for teachers in remote areas. Caring teachers without good social
work skills can frustrate students who tend to be easily offended by
unintentionally hurtful words, Chow said.</P>
      <P>The first lady also pointed out that school books designed for most children in
Taiwan are not necessarily suitable for children in remote areas. She suggested
designing learning materials and classes according to local cultures to better
fit these children's daily lives.</P>
      <P>Chow said children in remote areas are often raised by their grandparents, who
are often unable to help with the children's learning, and she expressed hope
that improvements in the economy will draw children's parents back to work in
their home areas. That way, she said, more normal families will be seen in
remote areas, which will support the education environment for disadvantaged
children.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Ferry services on the route between the Taiwan-held outlying island of Matsu and
the port of Mawei in China's Fujian Province have been increased by one crossing
per day from Friday to deal with increasing passenger numbers following the
expansion of the "mini three links" in late June.</P>
      <P>From Friday, the Minchu will depart from Fuao port in Matsu's Nangan township
every day at 9: 40 a.m., bringing the number of daily crossings to three. The
other two ferries depart from Matsu and Mawei, respectively, at 2 p.m.</P>
      <P>The average number of passengers using the route has risen to over 225 daily
since the Cabinet issued an executive order lifting restrictions on ferry
services to Fujian Province June 19.</P>
      <P>Following the directive, anyone with valid travel documents for entry to both
Taiwan and China can travel by ship to the Fujian ports of Xiamen, Quanzhou and
Mawei. Previously, only residents of the outlying  islands of Kinmen and Matsu,
as well as Taiwanese businessmen and their dependents, could use the route.</P>
      <P>Liu Teh-chuan, head of the Lienchieng Province transportation bureau, said the
extra ferry has been added to deal with growing passenger numbers. Lienchiang is
the name given to the Matsu administrative region.</P>
      <P>Immigration officials, customs officers, coast guard patrol forces and related
officials have undergone training to deal with the increase in passenger numbers
and to speed up customs clearance at Matsu's point of entry, Liu went on, adding
that adjustments to ferry services on the route will be made in the future based
on demand and practical considerations.</P>

    <HEADLINE>New TSEC head promises more global, open capital markets</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Schive Chi, the new chairman of the Taiwan Stock Exchange Corporation (TSEC)
pledged Friday to foster a more internationalized capital market, saying his key
missions were to attract more overseas investment, develop new financial
instruments and upgrade Taiwan's status to "developed market" rank.</P>
      <P>Schive made the comments during his inauguration ceremony today at the TSEC.</P>
      <P>Shive said that in the past, economic and financial constraints -- including the
cap on Taiwan-based firms' China-bound investment -- had driven away substantial
overseas capital.</P>
      <P>On July 17, the Cabinet relaxed the cap on China-bound investment to 60% of a
firm's net worth, effective this month. Before, such investment was limited to
40% or less of a firm's net worth.</P>
      <P>That relaxation was designed to encourage more foreign and local investment in
Taiwan, since foreign enterprises should now be more willing to base their
businesses on the island in order to indirectly access the China market.</P>
      <P>In another bid to attract overseas capital, the Cabinet decided Thursday to
allow qualified domestic institutional investors (QDII) from China to invest in
the Taiwan stock market beginning as soon as October. That initiative is seen by
many as an important step in cross-strait capital liberalization.</P>
      <P>These new measures can help Taiwan transform itself into a regional financial
hub, said Schive, an economics scholar who was formally vice minister of the
Council of Economic Planning and Development and the head of the Taiwan Academy
of Banking and Finance.</P>
      <P>Schive said that in order to expand the local securities market, TSEC will
promote greater variety in investment instruments, such as exchange-traded funds
(ETFs) and index warrants. He said such instruments will offer more investment
choices.</P>
      <P>Schive said he will seek to upgrade Taiwan's financial status, as ranked by the
Financial Times Stock Exchange Group (FTSE) , from "advanced
emergingtodevelopedmarket rank.</P>
      <P>The TSEC will develop a more internationalized trading system to ensure security
and order in the markets, while pursuing more opportunities to cooperate with
foreign securities companies,Schive said.</P>
      <P>The FTSE Group, an independent company which originated as a joint venture
between the Financial Times and the London Stock Exchange, is a provider of more
than 120,000 equity, bond and alternative asset class indices.</P>
      <P>The new chairman said he will collaborate with the government's plan to
streamline market operations  and management,  upgrade efficiency and boost the
competitiveness of Taiwan's capital markets.</P>
      <P>The government plans to establish a holding company to oversee market trading.
The company will integrate supervision of Taiwan's stock exchange, futures
exchange, securities central depository, and over-the-counter market.</P>
      <P>Combining the four authorities is in line with global trends, " Schive said.</P>
      <P>He said there's not yet a timetable for establishing the holding company.</P>

      <P>Guatemala has recently completed the renovation of a historical and cultural
heritage site, work that was documented by a team from National Cheng Kung
University (NCKU) and supported by financial assistance from Taiwan's
government.</P>
      <P>The NCKU team, led by Hsu Ming-fu, director of the NCKU College of Planning and
Design, has been in Antigua, Guatemala, since July 2007 to keep records of the
restoration of the former Las Capuchinas Monastery and the Sor Juana de
Maldonado Convent in the city.</P>
      <P>In participating in the project, NCKU is the first Taiwanese academic
institution to partake in any restoration work abroad involving UNESCO-
designated historical and cultural sites.</P>
      <P>Taiwan also recently donated US$400,000 to support the projects and has pledged
another US$300,000 to the Guatemalan national relic conservation committee that
is converting the two sites into museums.</P>
      <P>According to the university, the renovation of the Capuchinas Museum was
completed recently, with the museum opened to the public July 25, while the Sor
Juana de Maldonado Museum is scheduled to be inaugurated in April 2009.</P>
      <P>Antigua was founded in 1543 as the seat of the Spanish colonial for the Kingdom
of Guatemala, which covered part of Mexico and much of Central America.</P>
      <P>It was largely destroyed by an earthquake in 1773, which forced many of its
residents to relocated, but was never completely abandoned.</P>
      <P>Today,  its monumental  bougainvillea-draped  ruins and its preserved and
carefully restored Spanish colonial public buildings and private mansions form a
city of charm and romance unequaled in the Americas.</P>
      <P>UNESCO recognized Antigua, a town with just over 30,000 people, as a Cultural
Heritage of Mankind site in 1979.</P>
      <P>Because of its work in Antigua, NCKU has developed a friendship with Guatemala's
prestigious University of San Carlos, and the two tied a sisterhood knot
recently.</P>
      <P>In 2004, former Taiwan Vice President Annette Lu initiated a historical site
conservation project during a visit to the city.</P>
      <P>On another visit in 2005, she signed a letter of intent with her Guatemalan
counterpart, under which Taiwan would cooperate with Guatemala to restore and
preserve its historical sites.</P>
      <P>The agreement stated that Taiwan would donate a total of US$700,000 in two
stages to assist with the restoration of the two historical and cultural sites
in Antigua.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Paraguay's ambassador to Taiwan said Friday that diplomats are arranging a
formal meeting between President Ma Ying-jeou and Paraguay President-elect
Fernando Lugo ahead of Ma's visit to the South American ally, a signal the two
countries remain committed to strengthening diplomatic ties.</P>
      <P>"Yes, ...we are arranging (the meeting for President Ma and President Lugo) , "
Ambassador Ramon Diaz Pereira told the Central News Agency, ahead of Ma's Aug.
12-19 trip to Latin America to attend the inaugurations of Lugo on Aug.  15 and
Dominican Republic President- elect Leonel Fernandez on Aug. 16.</P>
      <P>He added that he is scheduled to leave a day earlier than Ma to Paraguay to
arrange for his visit.</P>
      <P>Pereira's comment was seen as an encouraging sign just days before Ma's planned
trip, as Lugo has said many times that he wants to switch diplomatic recognition
to China, giving rise to speculation that Taiwan might lose its only diplomatic
ally in South America.</P>
      <P>Asked about the state of current relations between Taiwan and Paraguay, Pereira
replied, "we hope that we will maintain the relationship as before...as
ambassador of the government, that is my hope. "</P>
      <P>Ma's planned visit is seen by some analysts as the first major test of his new
government's approach to China on the diplomatic front, which hopes to set aside
competition between Taiwan and China for allies.</P>
      <P>After taking office, Ma declared he would seek a "diplomatic truce" with China
in an attempt to end the "checkbook diplomacy" used by both sides to solicit
recognition by offering large sums of money to mostly poor nations.</P>
      <P>A meeting between Ma and Lugo could signal that Paraguay might be less keen to
switch allegiances than is widely portrayed. Simon Ko, director-general of the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Department of Central and South American Affairs,
said the ministry is currently consulting with its Paraguayan counterpart to set
up the encounter.</P>
      <P>"Based on diplomatic protocol, we are now trying to arrange a meeting for
President Ma and Lugo to meet privately, " Ko said.</P>
      <P>"Although no concrete result has been obtained on the time and location of the
meeting, we hope that all details will be confirmed before Ma leaves for
Paraguay."</P>
      <P>Taiwan, which now has 23 formal allies, has held diplomatic ties with Paraguay
since 1957.</P>

      <P>Interior Minister Liao Liou-yi said Friday that Taiwan's alternative military
service would still be necessary even after the country adopts an all-volunteer
military force.</P>
      <P>Liao made the remarks one day after Taiwan's military said it will adopt an all-
volunteer system as soon as 2014 to fulfill an election pledge made by President
Ma Ying-jeou earlier this year.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of National Defense (MND) plans to implement the volunteer system
beginning in 2010,  decreasing the number of conscripts by 10 percent annually,
Defense Minister Chen Chao-min said.</P>
      <P>Under the ministry's plan, those who do not volunteer for military service will
still need to receive three or four months of basic military training.</P>
      <P>The ministry aims to establish a 200,000-member force eventually, down from more
than 300,000 at present.</P>
      <P>Liao told reporters after speaking to alternative  service conscripts at a
ceremony held at a military training base in the central county of Taichung that
he hopes alternative military service will remain in the future.</P>
      <P>He explained that the some 80,000 to 100,000 male citizens in Taiwan who will
not volunteer for military service every year will be able to fulfill their
military duties by receiving military training in schools or participating in
alternative service.</P>
      <P>Taiwan now has 14,000-16,000 alternative service conscripts serving at local
schools, fire departments and high tech companies, according to interior
ministry.</P>
      <P>Some of them are also serving at government agencies in the fields of sports,
diplomacy, tourism,  medicine,  culture and environmental protection.</P>
      <P>Liao argued that such service prevents the waste of human resources or time.</P>
      <P>For example, he said, allowing alternative service conscripts to serve at local
technology companies can both meet the companies' needs for technology and
people, and help the conscripts keep their skills up to date.</P>
      <P>The interior ministry also launched a program in 2007 to help disadvantaged
children with their school studies, with more than 400 alternative service
conscripts joining the program this summer to assist more than 1,700 children.</P>
      <P>On Friday, the defense minister said that Taiwan would follow the United States
and Japan in switching to an all-volunteer military, but added that further
planning for financing military spending and restructuring the troops is needed.</P>
      <P>At present, Taiwan's conscription system targets males over the age of 18.
Starting from Jan. 1 this year, Taiwan cut military service to one year.</P>
      <P>Opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Legislator Chai Trong-rong said
Friday that the defense ministry should first solve existing problems before
adopting an all-volunteer force.</P>
      <P>Chai said many people find it difficult to adjust to military life after
volunteering to become soldiers or officers.</P>
      <P>There is no mechanism in place, however, to allow them to leave the  military,
which  forces  them  to  intentionally  behave inappropriately to try and get
kicked out of the military, he observed.</P>
      <P>He urged the ministry to set up such a mechanism soon.</P>
      <P>Also, after related regulations take effect, those who serve four years in the
military will be designated as "veterans" and become eligible for a retirement
payment of at least NT$150,000, Chai said.</P>
      <P>With another system already in place under which more than 300,000 conscripts
have retired after three and a half years but without a lump-sum payment, Chai
wondered if they would be allowed to volunteer to rejoin the military as officer
trainees or officers for another six months to get the benefit.</P>
      <P>Chai also noted that he had received complaints accusing the defense ministry of
exaggerating benefits or hiding negative aspects of military life when
recruiting volunteer soldiers and officers.</P>
      <P>Another issue questioned by the lawmaker was whether the increase in number of
personnel recruiters from 120 to 2,700 to 3,000 to handle  the all-volunteer
system would affect  the military's operations.</P>

      <P>The government warned the public Friday of the hazards -- including coma and
death -- of three designer drugs that have recently been seized in raids on
night clubs and from passengers entering the country from New Zealand and
Australia.</P>
      <P>Liu Chia-juey,  a drug analyst at the National Bureau of Controlled Drugs under
the Cabinet-level Department of Health (DOH) , said that justice and aviation
officials have informed the bureau of three problem drugs: BZP, TFMPP and DOB.</P>
      <P>The three are often sold to unsuspecting users as the popular club drug
"ecstasy" (the common name for the amphetamine MDMA) or promoted as an ecstasy
alternative.</P>
      <P>BZP is a synthetic stimulant, TFMPP is a hallucinogen, and DOB, or
Brolamfetamine, is a psychedelic hallucinogen.</P>
      <P>According to Liu, BZP and TFMPP are listed as first-grade medical drugs in the
United States, while DOB is banned. But in Taiwan, the use of BZP and TFMPP has
not been restricted, while DOB is listed as a second-grade medical drug whose
possession or sale is illegal.</P>
      <P>There have been several cased of DOB-related deaths in other countries, Liu
said. He added that even low doses of the drug can cause vomiting, cramps and
even coma.</P>
      <P>The combination of BZP and TFMPP produces a range of side effects, including
pronounced visual effects and a "hangover" effect. The use of TFMPP on its own
can cause insomnia, nausea or headaches.</P>
      <P>Dr. Yang Chen-chang, from Taipei Veterans General Hospital's poison control
center, said that a patient he treated died from liver and kidney failure after
taking the illicit drugs at a home party.</P>
      <P>Yang warned the public to avoid the three drugs, since their effects vary
dramatically from one person to another based on body chemistry, age, gender and
dose.</P>
      <P>He warned that a "cocktail" mix of the three drugs, even in low doses, could
cause stroke or psychosis. endiem /JA</P>

      <P>The Taipei City government plans to design a cap with reflectors to be worn by
senior citizens in order to make them more highly visible to vehicle drivers on
the roads, Taipei City Mayor Hau Lung-bin said Friday.</P>
      <P>The idea came from the observation that seniors seem to favor wearing caps when
they go out, Hau said, adding that light reflectors on the hats will allow
drivers to clearly see pedestrians and thus help to prevent accidents.</P>
      <P>Luo Shiaw-shyan, director-general of Taipei City's Department of Transportation,
noted that many senior citizens like to go out for exercise at night or at dawn
when visibility is lower than in the daytime.</P>
      <P>According to Chen Ming-cheng, commander of Taipei City Police Department's
Traffic Division, there were five traffic deaths in the city in June, with four
of the victims being elderly people, 80 years old on average, who were hit by
cars while walking on the street.</P>
      <P>Taipei City introduced a pedestrian safety measure for the elderly four years
ago when it provided 800,000 free wristbands with reflectors to residents over
65. The city government also encouraged senior citizens to wear bright colors
that they would be more highly visible to drivers, Luo said.</P>
      <P>He said that his department will disclose more details of the new plan to
improve elderly pedestrian safety.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Businesses that joined the "Travel Shopping Assurance System" said Thursday that
their business hadn't improved since Taiwan began allowing more Chinese to visit
the country last month, despite high expectations.</P>
      <P>The number of Chinese tourist arrivals over the past two weeks averaged only
200-300 per day. That amount was far lower -- less than a tenth -- of the 3,000
Chinese tourists permitted to visit Taiwan per day under a tourism agreement
reached by Taipei and Beijing in June.</P>
      <P>Business representatives said that those low numbers meant that sales at their
shops weren't as brisk as expected.</P>
      <P>They made the remarks at a ceremony to mark the joining of 54 businesses to the
Travel Shopping Assurance System. That system was developed by the Travel
Quality Assurance Association to ensure that foreign tourists get a fair deal
for all products sold at member stores.</P>
      <P>More than 150 stores nationwide have joined the system. Of those, 18 sell
agricultural and fishery products, including those that produce Alishan tea. The
newly-added members also include many 3C consumer electronics outlets,
eyeglasses stores, and vitamin and supplements shops.</P>
      <P>Among the 150 stores in the system, only about 20 received orders from their
Chinese customers in July.</P>
      <P>Association chairman Boggy Lin admitted that Chinese tourist arrivals to Taiwan
were lower than expected. But he expressed optimism that the companies' sales
would get a boost in September and October, when Taiwan is expected to see great
numbers of inbound Chinese tourists.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Tourism Bureau Director-General Janice Lai said that Chinese tourist
arrivals were lower than expected in part because it takes two weeks for Chinese
tourists to apply to visit Taiwan, and because seats on non-stop cross-strait
weekend charter flights are still scarce.</P>
      <P>Several of the system's new member companies have experience of serving Chinese
tourists who arrived in Taiwan via a third location or hold a second passport
from another country. Such Chinese tourists have been allowed to visit Taiwan
since 2002.</P>
      <P>Vendors also commented on Chinese tourists' distinct shopping habits. Hsu Jun-
chin, a representative of the Taipei County-based Paoyee watch and spectacle
store chain, said that Chinese tourists' favorite watch brands were Longines,
Rado, and Omega. Most Chinese visitors prefer watches with a metal strap, rather
than the leather strap favored by Taiwanese customers, she said.</P>
      <P>Hsu expressed  confidence  in future business from Chinese tourists, saying that
Taiwan offers a wide range of options for tax-free watches, allowing mainland
customers to avoid the 20% luxury tax levied on high-end watches in China.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Buckwheat allergy cases have been rare in Taiwan, but a 57-year-old businessman
has nearly been killed three times in the past three years after unwittingly
ingesting food items containing small amounts of buckwheat flour.</P>
      <P>The businessman, whose name was withheld and who was identified only as a
Taiwanese businessman operating in China, was first struck by a buckwheat
reaction in October 2005 after eating a bowl of buckwheat noodles in China,
according to Hsu Shih-tah, director of the Department of Allergy and Immunity of
Mackay Memorial Hospital in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Within half an hour of consuming the noodles, the businessman suffered an itchy
throat and tongue and a skin rash.</P>
      <P>He then fell unconscious from shock and was rushed to a nearby hospital but was
saved by Chinese doctors, who suspected afterward that he had suffered an
allergic reaction to buckwheat flour.</P>
      <P>In 2006 in Taiwan, according to Hsu, the businessman again went into shock after
eating one of five small grain buns he took with him while hiking on a hill in
suburban Taipei. He was rushed to Mackay Memorial for emergency treatment.</P>
      <P>After recovering, the businessman returned to the store where he bought the buns
and was told they contained buckwheat flour, convincing him that he was fatally
alleric to buckwheat, according to Hsu.</P>
      <P>Yet, despite his best efforts to prevent further problems, the businessman fell
victim a third time in China in April this year while being entertained by
friends at a restaurant.</P>
      <P>The man began enjoying a bowl of noodles after double checking with his hosts
that they were not made with buckwheat, but he quickly developed an acute
asthmatic attack after eating about half the noodles and then went into shock
before and after being rushed to an emergency room.</P>
      <P>Afterward, they discovered that the chef at the restaurant unwittingly added
buckwheat flour into regular wheat flour to make the noodles.</P>
      <P>Buckwheat, often used in a variety of foods, including pancakes and Japanese
soba noodles, is popular for its rich flavor and high nutritional value. Being
gluten-free, it is also a sought-after alternative for those who are gluten
intolerant.</P>
      <P>According to Hsu, buckwheat allergy cases are extremely rare in Taiwan, with the
most common allergic cases involving mites.</P>
      <P>Hsu suggested that patients who know they are allergic to buckwheat should carry
adrenaline with them at all times to inject into themselves if they suffer an
allergic reaction.</P>

      <P>Nine hospitals in Taiwan received awards from the Taiwan Society of Health
Promoting Hospitals recently for demonstrating excellence in promoting health.</P>
      <P>Vice President Vincent Siew presented the awards to the nine hospitals at a
ceremony on July 27 on behalf of the association.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Adventist Hospital, a teaching hospital that serves the greater Taipei
area, won the Model Health-Promoting Hospital Award for not only providing
integrated professional medical care, but also promoting a healthy lifestyle as
part of its preventive medicine program.</P>
      <P>The other eight hospitals  that won the Health  Promotion Excellence Award are
Taichung Hospital in Taichung City; Cardinal Tien Hospital's Yung Ho Branch in
Taipei; Changhua Christian Hospital in Changhua City; National Taiwan University
Hospital's Yunlin County Branch; Tzu-ai General Hospital in Yunlin County;
Taipei City Hospital's Renai Branch; and Lishin Hospital in Taoyuan County.</P>
      <P>Changhua Christian Hospital received an additional Friendly Workplace Award,
while Taipei Medical University Hospital and Lishin Hospital were each honored
with an Organizational Reform Award.</P>
      <P>The Yunlin branch of National Taiwan University Hospital also won a Creativity
Award for running a successful methadone maintenance treatment program in the
local community, while the Buddhist Dalin Tzu Chin General Hospital in Chiayi
County was honored with two Creativity Awards for launching a community health-
promoting program and for turning a stairway of the hospital into a healthy
walkway.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Society of Health Promoting Hospitals, founded in August 2008, is
working in conjunction with the Taiwan Network of Health Promotion Hospitals,

      <P>The Taiwan Association for Human Rights (TAHR) will work with the Thailand

and Taiwanese inmates in Thai prisons, the association's chairman said in a

      <P>According to TAHR Chairman Chang Hsueh-hai, the association will design a
questionnaire for Thai prisoners in Taiwan to gain a better understanding of

      <P>Thailand's Trade and Economic Office in Taipei will help provide a translation

      <P>Results of the surveys will serve as a reference for future improvements in

      <P>The association will also recruit Thai people in Taiwan to take translation
courses so that they can provide translation services in future legal

      <P>Chang expressed the hope that Arbhorn Manasvanich, executive director of the
Thailand Trade and Economic Office, will support the association's push for an
inmate exchange program between Taiwan and Thailand -- something long hoped for

      <P>It may require an additional NT$2 billion (US$65.57 million) to NT$3 billion to
complete the National Palace Museum (NPM) southern branch, given the recent

      <P>Chou made the remarks after inspecting the site of the NPM southern branch in
Chiayi County near the Chiayi county government, accompanied by the county's
Magistrate Chen Ming-wen.</P>
      <P>Chen, who wants to make the southern branch one of his major legacies when his

      <P>The construction project, which includes clearing land and building an

    <HEADLINE>Fuel prices go unchanged, but for how long?</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  August 1 (CNA)
08/01/08  20:43:39
(By Yeh Fang-hsun)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's state-run oil refiner CPC Corp., Taiwan, opted Friday not to increase
domestic fuel prices to help stem inflation, but the freeze may only last a week
as the government decided to adjust the mechanism it uses to determine prices at
the pump.</P>
      <P>After discussions with its supervisory authority, the Ministry of Economic
Affairs (MOEA), CPC Corp. decided to help stabilize domestic consumer prices and
meet the public's expectations of a price freeze, a company spokesman said.</P>
      <P>With the two typhoons arriving in July that caused domestic prices to rise even
higher, we decided to absorb the rising costs to help the people get through
this critical period, Chu Shao-hua, CPC Corp.'s vice president and spokesman,
said Friday at a news conference announcing the decision.</P>
      <P>CPC Corp.'s chief domestic rival,  privately-owned  Formosa Petrochemical Co.,
followed the state-run oil giant's lead in keeping its prices unchanged, citing
a need to remain competitive at its 600 gas stations, including 200 franchises.</P>
      <P>Friday's announcement countered widespread speculation in the news media
Thursday that gasoline prices would be increased by NT$0.8 per liter.</P>
      <P>The MOEA and CPC Corp. had been mulling increasing fuel prices in August under a
floating price mechanism used to adjust prices on a monthly basis.</P>
      <P>With international crude oil prices rising 2.05 percent in July to US$131.85 per
barrel from US$129.20 per barrel in June, gasoline and diesel fuel prices should
have been increased by NT$0.5 to NT$0.6 per liter under the monthly price
adjustment system.</P>
      <P>An increase would have been highly unpopular and hard to explain, however,
because  of the nearly US$20 per barrel dropoff in international crude prices
since exceeding US$147 per barrel in mid-July.</P>
      <P>To more accurately reflect fluctuations in global oil markets, the MOEA
announced later Friday that in the future, local fuel prices would be reviewed
on a weekly rather than monthly basis, a change Chu believed would benefit the
company's pricing decisions.</P>
      <P>"With international oil prices changing each day, adjusting fuel prices every
week will help the company more efficiently reflect costs," the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>Keeping domestic prices at their present levels in August without reflecting the
higher price of crude in July would add NT$600 million (US$19.73 million) to the
company's losses for the month, Chu said.</P>
      <P>The company has already been pounded by the combination of soaring international
crude prices and a freeze imposed on domestic fuel prices in the first five
months of the year by the previous Democratic Progressive Party administration.</P>
      <P>From January to May, CPC lost NT$43.15 billion, including losses of more than
NT$10 billion in March, April and May, Chu said.</P>
      <P>The new Kuomintang  government restored the floating price mechanism after
taking power May 20 and promptly hiked local fuel prices by NT$3.9 per liter on
May 28.</P>
      <P>The move helped limit the company's losses to NT$3.45 billion in June, but
despite another NT$1.5 liter hike on July 1, Chu estimates CPC Corp. lost NT$4.5
to NT$5 billion in July because of the higher cost of crude.</P>
      <P>Chu emphasized that Taiwan's fuel prices were still relatively cheap compared
with those in other Asian countries, saying prices at the pump here were around
NT$6.65 lower per liter than elsewhere in Asia.</P>

      <P>Minister of Education Cheng Jei-cheng said Friday the ministry will subsidize
the lunches of more students in elementary and junior high schools starting in
September.</P>
      <P>Cheng said the government will fully fund the lunches of 223,000 students at a
cost of NT$1.27 billion (US$41.69 million).</P>
      <P>The ministry is already subsidizing students from low-income families,  from
families  that  have  encountered  unexpected difficulties, or from families
that teachers think need the subsidies after paying them visits.</P>
      <P>Starting from September, students from "low- or middle-income families" will
also be included in the program, meaning 52,000 more students will have their
lunches paid for than during the previous academic year.</P>
      <P>Students in five administrative districts considered to have more abundant
financial resources -- Taipei City, Taipei County, Kaohsiung City, and the two
outlying islands of Kinmen and Matsu -- have not and will not have their lunches
subsidized by the Ministry of Education, Cheng said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taipei area Housing market feels pinch of economic downturn</HEADLINE>

      <P>Housing markets across most of Taiwan were sluggish in July, with the greater
Taipei area in northern Taiwan the most affected, real estate insiders said
Friday.</P>
      <P>The housing market in the greater  Taipei area contracted noticeably  in July,
both in terms of property  values  and transactions, continuing a severe decline
seen in May and June.</P>
      <P>Over the past three months, housing sales in Taiwan's capital have plummeted,
with transactions down 60 percent in July compared to April, when the housing
market in Taiwan's capital began losing steam.</P>
      <P>A big reason for the lack of activity, real estate brokers said, was that
property investors have been pulling out of the market.</P>
      <P>They have been beset by higher mortgage payments driven by higher interest rates
and a need to sell property to cover losses on the local stock market, which has
lost around 20 percent of its value since early June.</P>
      <P>Most potential buyers, industry insiders say, are now those seeking to purchase
a house of their own.</P>
      <P>An executive at real estate broker Evertrust Rehouse Co., Ltd., said market
indicators in July suggested a continued decline in August -- "ghost month" on
the lunar calendar -- despite the recent sale of two plots of land in a prime
district in downtown Taipei City at near record prices.</P>
      <P>Housing prices in the greater Taipei area averaged NT$267,000 (US$8,783) per
ping (equal to 3.3 square meters) in July, down by 10 percent from June,
Evertrust Rehouse statistics showed. Transactions in July also decreased by 15
percent compared to the June figure.</P>
      <P>Property prices in Taiwan's prime districts have corrected by less than 5
percent month to month.</P>
      <P>The housing market in Taichung City in central Taiwan also contracted slightly
last month, as the average price per ping fell by 5 percent from June to
NT$91,000, while the number of deals also plunged by some 30 percent, according
to Evertrust Rehouse figures.</P>
      <P>The residential property market in the Kaohsiung area in southern Taiwan was the
only one in Taiwan to show some strength. The average price per ping in the area
remained at around NT$90,000 in July, while transactions were up 5 percent
compared to June.</P>
      <P>Although the U.S. subprime loan crisis jolted the global market in many sectors
when it erupted in July 2007, Taiwan's housing market has performed even worse a
year later, one housing property broker commented.</P>
      <P>But he predicted that the overall housing market could rebound in the fourth
quarter if international oil prices stabilized or fell.</P>
      <P>According to a report published in late April by the Institute for Physical
Planning and Information, a housing bubble was already looming in Taiwan,
particularly in Taipei City.</P>
      <P>Residential property prices in Taipei City have surged by 50 percent over the
past three years, while average local household income has grown by only 2
percent over the same period -- a stunning contrast that shows housing prices
have irrationally outpaced local residents' earnings, the report stated.</P>
      <P>In the first quarter of this year, the average price per ping (3.305 square
meters) for pre-sold houses in Taipei City reached NT$530,000 (US$17,377), the
report noted.</P>
      <P>Some economists believe that the overheated housing market caused by speculation
over possible Chinese investment and the popularity of real estate as an
investment to fight inflation have artificially pushed up residential property
prices by about 30 percent.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Relationship among U.S., China, Taiwan in 'better place': Bush</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>United States President George W. Bush has said that the relationship between
the U.S., China and Taiwan is in a "better place," the South China Morning Post
reported Friday.</P>
      <P>Accordig to the front-page report, Bush made the remarks in an interview at the
White House with the paper and three other regional papers.</P>
      <P>Bush also said he sought to highlight the consistency of U.S. policy in his time
in office.</P>
      <P>Addressing U.S. policy on relations across the Taiwan Strait, Bush said he made
it abundantly clear that there were some red lines for the U.S. on this issue.</P>
      <P>He said there would be no unilateral declaration of independence by Taiwan and
that U.S. policy was still the same.</P>
      <P>When asked about Sino-U.S. relations, Bush warned against calling China either a
strategic competitor or a potential partner of the U.S., saying the nations'
"good, solid" relationship had grown too complex for labels.</P>
      <P>One reason for him to call it complex, he said, is that in America, trade with
China is not necessarily universally accepted as good.</P>
      <P>The president also said he is worried that Americans have become isolationist
and protectionist.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Nantou County certified a traditional grocery store as an environmentally
friendly green store Friday, the first of its kind to earn the green label in
the landlocked county.</P>
      <P>Chiao Hsin Supermarket, located in the town of Puli, earned the distinction
after passing the county government's screening process, allowing it to join
some of the biggest names in retailing in the country to obtain the "green
store" label.</P>
      <P>Ten other stores in the county had already earned the honor but were all part of
big chains, such as Carrefour and the Tsann Kuen Group, which operates the "3C"
chain of stores selling electronic and IT products, according to the county
government.</P>
      <P>County officials praised the Chiao Hsin market for its efforts in environmental
protection and expressed the hope that more local stores would follow the model
and turn "green."</P>
      <P>Encouraging local business operators to go "green" is part of the central
government's efforts to save energy and cut carbon dioxide emissions to combat
the threat of global warming.</P>
      <P>Under Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) regulations, stores labeled
as "green" must sell "green products, " develop marketing strategies in the
spirit of environmental protection, and manage the shop in ways that protect the
environment, such as using energy-saving devices and packing materials.</P>
      <P>A certified green store must also be devoted to promoting environmental
protection concepts and take active measures to encourage consumers to purchase
green products.</P>
      <P>Such a store is also required to be a gathering spot for recyclables and to
promote the idea of recycling, according to the EPA.</P>
      <P>The so-called green products are those produced, sold, used, and abandoned in a
spirit of recycling, low-pollution and energy-saving.</P>
      <P>The stores that sell these products, legally registered and holding a for-profit
business registration certificate, are entitled to apply for the EPA's "green
store" label.</P>
      <P>Currently, there are 360 certified green stores around Taiwan.</P>

      <P>High-quality farm and fishery produce and organic goods, such as fruit, honey,

part of the government's efforts to raise public awareness of environmental
protection.</P>
      <P>According to COA officials, more than 90 percent of the products to be displayed
at some 40 booths will be items certified by several licensed and famous
institutes. The products will include 200 gift bags containing four popular
fruits -- pineapples, mangos, star fruit and guavas.</P>
      <P>The gift box will be one the COA's major promotions during the upcoming Beijing
Olympics. Throughout August, passengers on the Beijing subway will see a series
of advertisements featuring the four Taiwanese fruits, COA officials said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Experts from Taiwan and China elected into WTO group simultaneously</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Experts from Taiwan and China were elected simultaneously into an influential
World Trade Organization group Thursday, breaking a political deadlock and
easing antagonism that had lingered since both became WTO members in 2002.</P>
      <P>The WTO announced Friday that the Committee on Subsidies and Countervailing
Measures elected four members of the Permanent Group of Exports (PEG) ,
including Lo Chang-fa, a well- known scholar in international trade law in
Taiwan and China's Zhang Yuqing.</P>
      <P>A senior economic official cautioned that one should not read too much into a
single event, but acknowledged that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait "at least
did not boycott each other's candidate in the selection process."</P>
      <P>The otherwise routine elections for other member states epitomize the political
struggle between Taiwan and China in the WTO. It would be the first time that
both sides of Taiwan Strait reconciled on major personnel  arrangements,  an
encouraging  sign of better interaction in the international arena.</P>
      <P>Lo, a distinguished law professor at the prestigious National Taiwan University,
was first recommended in 2005 to be a member of the PEG, but the nomination was
blocked by China's delegation, which questioned Lo's qualifications. The vacancy
has been left open since then.</P>
      <P>Taiwan in turn retaliated last year by initially objecting to the candidacy of
China's Zhang Yuejiao to be a member of the Appellate Body under the WTO's trade
dispute body, but under tremendous pressure from other member states and the
secretariat, Taiwan eventually gave in.</P>
      <P>The overall atmosphere of this year's PEG selection provided a dramatic contrast
to the acrimony of previous years.</P>
      <P>According to sources in Geneva, Taiwan and China reached a tacit agreement to
support each other's candidate prior to the election while lobbying for support
from other countries.</P>
      <P>The relationship between Taiwan and China in the WTO would normally be best
described as confrontational due to political differences.</P>
      <P>It is still unclear if the turnaround has anything to do with the transfer of
power in Taiwan to President Ma Ying-jeou, who has strongly advocated a
"diplomatic truce" and better relations with China.</P>
      <P>Senior officials, trying to play down the political significance of the latest
development, said all WTO member states claimed that they elected the experts on
the basis of "merit."</P>
      <P>The PEG is a body of five independent experts that may be requested to assist a
panel, provide an advisory opinion on the existence and nature of any subsidy,
or be consulted by any members on the nature of any subsidy it intends to
introduce or currently maintain.</P>
      <P>The term for a PEG member is five years, and the results of the election are
retroactive to the time when the vacancy opened. Due to the three-year delay,
Lo's actual term will be shortened to two years.</P>

      <P>Nine hotels in the southern Taiwan city of Tainan signed an agreement Friday to
join an earth-friendly program that gives up to 55 percent discounts to
customers who bring their own towels, tooth brushes, soap, toothpaste and
shampoo.</P>
      <P>The program was presented with the blessing of the Environmental Protection
Bureau under the Tainan City government.</P>
      <P>The nine hotels are Evergreen Plaza Hotel, Tayih Landis Hotel, La Plaza hotel,
Hotel Tainan, Hotel Dynasty Tainan, the Taipung Suites, Wei-Yat Toong Mao Grand
Hotel, Cambridge Hotel, and Top Royal Hotel.</P>
      <P>The Evergreen Plaza Hotel, one of two five-star hotels in Tainan, pledged to
lower the price for a single room from NT$5,600 to NT$2,599 and the price for a
double room from NT$6,200 to NT$2,799, if customers bring their own personal
hygiene necessities.</P>
      <P>The Wei-Yat Toong Mao Grand Hotel also offered to reduce the price for two from
NT$4,800 to NT$2,188, if the same requirement is met.</P>
      <P>Officials at the Environmental Protection Bureau noted that some of the hotels

    <HEADLINE>Cross-strait detente will benefit East Asia: president</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Friday that improvement in relations across the
Taiwan Strait will benefit East Asian countries by ensuring regional stability
and peace.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks while meeting with Masaki Saito, the new head of the Taipei
Office of the Japanese Interchange Association which represents Japanese
interests in Taiwan in the absence of formal diplomatic ties.</P>
      <P>In the talks, Ma recalled that he had met with current Japanese Prime Minister
Yasuo Fukuda during a visit to Japan two years ago in his capacity as chairman
of the then opposition Kuomintang (KMT).</P>
      <P>At that time, Ma told Fukuda, who was then a member of the lower house of the
Japanese Diet, that if the KMT regained power, Ma would take active steps to
improve cross-strait relations and promote bilateral exchanges.</P>
      <P>Ma said he admires Fukuda's insight, as the prime minister had given a thumbs-up
to Ma's proposal by indicating that improved cross-strait relations and regional
peace were basically in Japan's interest.</P>
      <P>Over the past two years, Ma said, Tokyo-Beijing relations have made great
strides, as evidenced by the frequent exchange visits by high-ranking officials
and by military vessels. China and Japan have also reached a consensus on joint
exploration of oil reserves in the East China Sea, he noted.</P>
      <P>"All these developments are hard-won achievements over the 60 years since the
end of World War II, " Ma noted, added that the new developments will contribute
much to East Asian peace.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Ma went on, the two sides of the Taiwan Strait are also moving on a
reconciliatory course and actively improving their relations.</P>
      <P>"The  simultaneous  improvements  in  Taipei-Beijing  and Tokyo-Beijing
relations are new in the post-war East Asian arena and will definitely have a
profound impact on East Asian peace, " Ma observed. Many American academics and
think tanks share his views and are cautiously optimistic about East Asian
developments amid improved cross-strait ties, the president added.</P>
      <P>Turning to Taiwan-Japan relations, Ma said some people were worried about a
possible negative impact on bilateral ties following the June 12 incident in
which a Taiwanese recreational fishing boat sank after colliding with a Japanese
coast guard patrol ship in waters near the disputed Tiaoyutai Islands.</P>
      <P>Although the incident seemed to spark a confrontation between the two sides, no
conflict actually erupted thanks to the mutual trust between the leadership of
the two countries, Ma said.</P>
      <P>"After Fukuda publicly called for a reasoned peaceful resolution of the issue, I
immediately lent my full support to his appeal, and the two sides then resolved
the issue step by step through peaceful consultations, " Ma recalled, adding
that mutual trust was crucial to the satisfactory settlement of the issue.</P>
      <P>For his part, Saito said he is lucky to be assuming his post at a time when
Taiwan-Japan relations are proceeding very smoothly. With the mutual granting of
visa-free entry for tourists from the two countries, Saito said, a total of 2.5
million visits have been recorded annually.</P>
      <P>Japan is now Taiwan's second largest trade partner and Taiwan ranks fourth among
Japan's major trade partners. Saito said he looks forward to the further
strengthening of relations between the two countries during his tenure.</P>

      <P>Vice Foreign Affairs Minister Andrew Hsia said Friday that representatives from
Taiwan and Japan will begin negotiations to compensate a Taiwanese captain whose
recreational fishing boat sank in a collision with a Maritime Safety Agency of
Japan (JMSA) vessel in June.</P>
      <P>Hsia made the remarks after presiding over a meeting with the boat owner Ho
Hung-yi and officials from Taiwan and Japan.</P>
      <P>"Both sides reached an agreement in the meeting that they will each designate
legal experts and representatives to negotiate in Taipei on the compensation
issue so as to settle the matter quickly," Hsia said.</P>
      <P>The Japanese side took with them the details of the damage, provided by Ho, and
will indicate "within one week" when the negotiations will start, Hsia added.</P>
      <P>A ministry official also said that Ho, his crew members and the anglers who were
onboard the boat when it sank all wanted the negotiations to be held in Taipei.
They agreed that the Taipei county government will provide a lawyer, and that
the MOFA and the Fisheries Administration under the Council of Agriculture will
help to negotiate with Japan on compensation.</P>
      <P>The official related that Japanese officials from Interchange Association, the
de facto Japanese embassy in Taipei, expressed confidence that the Japanese
government will honor its pledge and will handle the compensation issue in
accordance with the relevant law.</P>
      <P>The Japanese will respect Ho's wishes and the JMSA will hire a lawyer to
negotiate with him on the compensation matter, according to the official.</P>
      <P>On June 10, Ho's ship carrying recreational anglers sank in waters near the
Tiaoyutais after it collided with a Japanese patrol vessel.</P>
      <P>The Tiaoyutais, located 102 nautical miles to the northeast of Taiwan, are

    <HEADLINE>Experts from Taiwan and China elected into WTO group simultaneously</HEADLINE>

      <P/>
      <P>Taipei, Aug. 1 (CNA) Experts from Taiwan and China were elected simultaneously
into an influential World Trade Organization group Thursday, breaking a
political deadlock and easing antagonism that had lingered since both became WTO
members in 2002.</P>
      <P>The WTO announced Friday that the Committee on Subsidies and Countervailing
Measures elected four members of the Permanent Group of Exports (PEG) ,
including Lo Chang-fa, a well- known scholar in international trade law in
Taiwan and China's Zhang Yuqing.</P>
      <P>A senior economic official cautioned that one should not read too much into a
single event, but acknowledged that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait "at least
did not boycott each other's candidate in the selection process."</P>
      <P>The otherwise routine elections for other member states epitomize the political
struggle between Taiwan and China in the WTO. It would be the first time that
both sides of Taiwan Strait reconciled on major personnel  arrangements,  an
encouraging  sign of better interaction in the international arena.</P>
      <P>Lo, a distinguished law professor at the prestigious National Taiwan University,
was first recommended in 2005 to be a member of the PEG, but the nomination was
blocked by China's delegation, which questioned Lo's qualifications. The vacancy
has been left open since then.</P>
      <P>Taiwan in turn retaliated last year by initially objecting to the candidacy of
China's Zhang Yuejiao to be a member of the Appellate Body under the WTO's trade
dispute body, but under tremendous pressure from other member states and the
secretariat, Taiwan eventually gave in.</P>
      <P>The overall atmosphere of this year's PEG selection provided a dramatic contrast
to the acrimony of previous years.</P>
      <P>According to sources in Geneva, Taiwan and China reached a tacit agreement to
support each other's candidate prior to the election while lobbying for support
from other countries.</P>
      <P>The relationship between Taiwan and China in the WTO would normally be best
described as confrontational due to political differences.</P>
      <P>It is still unclear if the turnaround has anything to do with the transfer of
power in Taiwan to President Ma Ying-jeou, who has strongly advocated a
"diplomatic truce" and better relations with China.</P>
      <P>Senior officials, trying to play down the political significance of the latest
development, said all WTO member states claimed that they elected the experts on
the basis of "merit."</P>
      <P>The PEG is a body of five independent experts that may be requested to assist a
panel, provide an advisory opinion on the existence and nature of any subsidy,
or be consulted by any members on the nature of any subsidy it intends to
introduce or currently maintain.</P>
      <P>The term for a PEG member is five years, and the results of the election are
retroactive to the time when the vacancy opened. Due to the three-year delay,
Lo's actual term will be shortened to two years.</P>

      <P>Nine hotels in the southern Taiwan city of Tainan signed an agreement Friday to
join an earth-friendly program that gives up to 55 percent discounts to
customers who bring their own towels, tooth brushes, soap, toothpaste and
shampoo.</P>
      <P>The program was presented with the blessing of the Environmental Protection
Bureau under the Tainan City government.</P>
      <P>The nine hotels are Evergreen Plaza Hotel, Tayih Landis Hotel, La Plaza hotel,
Hotel Tainan, Hotel Dynasty Tainan, the Taipung Suites, Wei-Yat Toong Mao Grand
Hotel, Cambridge Hotel, and Top Royal Hotel.</P>
      <P>The Evergreen Plaza Hotel, one of two five-star hotels in Tainan, pledged to
lower the price for a single room from NT$5,600 to NT$2,599 and the price for a
double room from NT$6,200 to NT$2,799, if customers bring their own personal
hygiene necessities.</P>
      <P>The Wei-Yat Toong Mao Grand Hotel also offered to reduce the price for two from
NT$4,800 to NT$2,188, if the same requirement is met.</P>
      <P>Officials at the Environmental Protection Bureau noted that some of the hotels
had already offered the earth-friendly program for some time, and that the
agreement they signed was intended to increase awareness among the public to
join the world's efforts to slow the global warming trend.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Cross-strait detente will benefit East Asia: president</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Friday that improvement in relations across the
Taiwan Strait will benefit East Asian countries by ensuring regional stability
and peace.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks while meeting with Masaki Saito, the new head of the Taipei
Office of the Japanese Interchange Association which represents Japanese
interests in Taiwan in the absence of formal diplomatic ties.</P>
      <P>In the talks, Ma recalled that he had met with current Japanese Prime Minister
Yasuo Fukuda during a visit to Japan two years ago in his capacity as chairman
of the then opposition Kuomintang (KMT).</P>
      <P>At that time, Ma told Fukuda, who was then a member of the lower house of the
Japanese Diet, that if the KMT regained power, Ma would take active steps to
improve cross-strait relations and promote bilateral exchanges.</P>
      <P>Ma said he admires Fukuda's insight, as the prime minister had given a thumbs-up
to Ma's proposal by indicating that improved cross-strait relations and regional
peace were basically in Japan's interest.</P>
      <P>Over the past two years, Ma said, Tokyo-Beijing relations have made great
strides, as evidenced by the frequent exchange visits by high-ranking officials
and by military vessels. China and Japan have also reached a consensus on joint
exploration of oil reserves in the East China Sea, he noted.</P>
      <P>"All these developments are hard-won achievements over the 60 years since the
end of World War II, " Ma noted, added that the new developments will contribute
much to East Asian peace.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Ma went on, the two sides of the Taiwan Strait are also moving on a
reconciliatory course and actively improving their relations.</P>
      <P>"The  simultaneous  improvements  in  Taipei-Beijing  and Tokyo-Beijing
relations are new in the post-war East Asian arena and will definitely have a
profound impact on East Asian peace, " Ma observed. Many American academics and
think tanks share his views and are cautiously optimistic about East Asian
developments amid improved cross-strait ties, the president added.</P>
      <P>Turning to Taiwan-Japan relations, Ma said some people were worried about a
possible negative impact on bilateral ties following the June 12 incident in
which a Taiwanese recreational fishing boat sank after colliding with a Japanese
coast guard patrol ship in waters near the disputed Tiaoyutai Islands.</P>
      <P>Although the incident seemed to spark a confrontation between the two sides, no
conflict actually erupted thanks to the mutual trust between the leadership of
the two countries, Ma said.</P>
      <P>"After Fukuda publicly called for a reasoned peaceful resolution of the issue, I
immediately lent my full support to his appeal, and the two sides then resolved
the issue step by step through peaceful consultations, " Ma recalled, adding
that mutual trust was crucial to the satisfactory settlement of the issue.</P>
      <P>For his part, Saito said he is lucky to be assuming his post at a time when
Taiwan-Japan relations are proceeding very smoothly. With the mutual granting of
visa-free entry for tourists from the two countries, Saito said, a total of 2.5
million visits have been recorded annually.</P>
      <P>Japan is now Taiwan's second largest trade partner and Taiwan ranks fourth among
Japan's major trade partners. Saito said he looks forward to the further
strengthening of relations between the two countries during his tenure.</P>

      <P>Vice Foreign Affairs Minister Andrew Hsia said Friday that representatives from
Taiwan and Japan will begin negotiations to compensate a Taiwanese captain whose
recreational fishing boat sank in a collision with a Maritime Safety Agency of
Japan (JMSA) vessel in June.</P>
      <P>Hsia made the remarks after presiding over a meeting with the boat owner Ho
Hung-yi and officials from Taiwan and Japan.</P>
      <P>"Both sides reached an agreement in the meeting that they will each designate
legal experts and representatives to negotiate in Taipei on the compensation
issue so as to settle the matter quickly," Hsia said.</P>
      <P>The Japanese side took with them the details of the damage, provided by Ho, and
will indicate "within one week" when the negotiations will start, Hsia added.</P>
      <P>A ministry official also said that Ho, his crew members and the anglers who were
onboard the boat when it sank all wanted the negotiations to be held in Taipei.
They agreed that the Taipei county government will provide a lawyer, and that
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Fisheries Administration under the
Council of Agriculture will help to negotiate with Japan on compensation.</P>
      <P>The official related that Japanese officials from Interchange Association, the
de facto Japanese embassy in Taipei, expressed confidence that the Japanese
government will honor its pledge and will handle the compensation issue in
accordance with the relevant law.</P>
      <P>The Japanese will respect Ho's wishes and the JMSA will hire a lawyer to
negotiate with him on the compensation matter in Taipei, according to the
official.</P>
      <P>On June 10, Ho's ship carrying recreational anglers sank in waters near the
Tiaoyutais after it collided with a Japanese patrol vessel.</P>
      <P>The Tiaoyutais, located 102 nautical miles to the northeast of Taiwan, are
claimed by Japan, Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>Ho was released three days after he was detained by Japanese authorities on the
Japan-controlled island of Ishigaki.</P>
      <P>Director of the General Affairs Department under the Taipei Office of the
Interchange Association later called on Ho at his home in Rueifang, Taipei
County and expressed regret on behalf of the Maritime Safety Agency of Japan
over the incident.</P>

      <P>Taiwan will have helped establish 41 digital opportunity centers in seven
developing nations by the end of 2008 under an Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation
(APEC) initiative to bridge the digital divide, the Ministry of Economic Affairs
said Saturday.</P>
      <P>From August 2004 until mid-July 2008, 34 such centers had been set up in Chile,
Indonesia, Peru, the Philippines, Papua New Guinea, Vietnam and Thailand,  with
more than 51,000 information  and communications technology professionals in
these countries trained through the program, according to the ministry's Bureau
of Foreign Trade.</P>
      <P>The APEC Digital Opportunity Center (ADOC) initiative was put forth by Taiwan in
2003 during an annual informal APEC leadership summit held in Bangkok, Thailand.</P>
      <P>The goal was to use Taiwan's edge in information technology and digital
experience to assist developing APEC member states in upgrading their
information technology capabilities.</P>
      <P>Through the project, Taiwan also hopes to enhance its global visibility,
strengthen its friendship with other APEC member states, and help expand
business opportunities for the country's businesses, the bureau said.</P>
      <P>In preparation for the conclusion of the first phase of the ADOC initiative at
the end of 2008, senior officials and business leaders from Taiwan will meet
with their counterparts from other APEC member states during ADOC Week 2008, set
for Sept. 29 to Oct. 4 in Taipei, to discuss issues concerning the promotion of

      <P>Despite the devastation wrought by Tropical Storm Kalmaegi and Typhoon Fung-Wong

country sell their produce directly to consumers.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Seminar on stadium project transportation ends in chaos</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Chaos erupted Saturday at a seminar on the transportation assessment of the
Taipei Dome Complex, with local residents accusing the city government and the
project's contractor of colluding for profit and ignoring their concerns.</P>
      <P>Charging that the project was planned and approved in a "black box," residents
in the Xinyi, Daan and Songshan districts surrounding the designated site for
the indoor stadium demanded that the contractor and the city reassess the
project, and call it off if necessary.</P>
      <P>Shouting matches erupted among the participants, with residents angry that they
had been left out of three previous meetings at which transportation plans for
the stadium complex were assessed.</P>
      <P>The Farglory Group, which signed a contract with the city government  in October
2006 to manage the project  on a BOT (build-operate-transfer) basis, plans to
invest more than NT$23 billion (US$ 700 million) in the 429,000 square meter
complex -- called the Taipei Culture and Sports District or "Taipei Dome."</P>
      <P>Before it can begin work on the complex, however, the city government must
assign the land rights to Farglory and give it the necessary building permits,
which are contingent on passing a transportation assessment.</P>
      <P>The complex, to include a 40,000-seat indoor stadium with surrounding shopping
and residential districts and scheduled to be completed by 2010, will be located
on the site of the historic Songshan Tobacco Factory at the corner of Zhongxiao
East Road and Guangfu South Road in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Local residents fear that the stadium will create traffic nightmares in an
already congested part of the city.</P>
      <P>"This is collusion between businessmen and government officials," one of the
residents shouted.It is self-evident that the government is profiting a certain
conglomerate.</P>
      <P>Aaron Huang,  a consultant  of the nongovernmental  Global Talentrepreneur
Innovation and Collaboration Association and area resident, told the Central
News Agency that the opinions of the residents were totally excluded from the
decision-making process.</P>
      <P>No one from the company or the government has ever consulted us and every
meeting they have had was under the table, he said.We will not accept the fact
that they are holding this seminar just to 'notify' us of what they plan to do.</P>
      <P>But Tsai Chung-yi, an executive in Farglory's public affairs department, told
the Central News Agency that on the advice of the city government, the company
had invited transportation experts to previous meetings to help assess
congestion issues related to the plan.</P>
      <P>Those experts, Tsai said, were in fact representing the interests of local
residents.</P>
      <P>At the seminar, Farglory presented supporting measures to ease congestion, but
Kuomintang Taipei City Councilor Lee Ching-yuan, said the measures were useless
and impractical.</P>
      <P>To build such a big complex right in the heart of the city is absolutely
preposterous, Lee said.No advanced countries or even the Olympic stadiums in
Beijing were built in the city center.</P>
      <P>He urged the project to be reviewed again, arguing that Taipei City Mayor Hau
Lung-bin  should  not accept the deal without questioning an incorrect decision
made by his predecessor and now Taiwan's president, Ma Ying-jeou.</P>
      <P>Democratic Progressive Party Taipei City Councilor Hung Chien-yi said the
project would definitely paralyze transportation in the area.</P>
      <P>"It is not only a joke but also has no chance to succeed, Hung said.The rights
of the general public are sacrificed for the profits of a big company."</P>

      <P>Domestic banks' overdue loan ratio stood at 1.55 percent at the end of June,
down 0.06 percentage points from the previous month, the Executive Yuan's

trillion (US$589.04 billion), up NT$119 billion over a month earlier, while
their overdue loans stood at NT$281.2 billion, down NT$8.7 billion, the

      <P>Of Taiwan's 37 banks, a total of 36 had outstanding loan ratios of lower than 5
percent, including 29 with outstanding loan ratios of under 2.5 percent,
according to the commission.</P>
      <P>It said that Taiwan banks' outstanding loan ratio has been declining gradually
since July 2007 when the figure stood at 2.35 percent.</P>
      <P>The commission added that it will continue to monitor banks with high

    <HEADLINE>Nearly 20% of soybean-based food products in Taipei sub-standard</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Nearly 20 percent of soybean-based food products recently tested in Taipei City
were found not to meet food safety standards, the municipal government's
Department of Health said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Chiang Yu-mei, head of the department's Food and Drug Division, said that of the
61 products tested around the city in June, 12 failed to meet the city's food
safety standards.</P>
      <P>Six of the products contained excessive levels of the food preservative benzoic
acid, while six contained hydrogen peroxide, which is banned in food products in
the city, Chiang said.</P>
      <P>Five of the soy-based products that failed the safety test were sold in Huan-nan
Market. A majority of such items sold in Taipei City are processed at factories
in Dasi township, Taoyuan County.</P>
      <P>Hydrogen peroxide, which is chiefly used to kill bacteria and as a bleaching
agent, can cause damage to the human body if ingested in large amounts.</P>
      <P>Some of the symptoms of ingesting the chemical include headaches, nausea,
vomiting, diarrhea and even ulcers, Chiang said.</P>
      <P>She urged citizens to thoroughly wash and soak tofu products they purchase for
at least 20 minutes to get rid of any hydrogen peroxide that the food items
might contain.</P>
      <P>Chiang added that although  benzoic  acid can be used in soybean-based food
products in amounts of up to 0.6 grams per kilogram, it can cause damage to the
kidney and livers.</P>
      <P>Noting that washing and soaking are not helpful in removing benzoic acid because
it does not dissolve in water, Chiang urged people to cook their tofu products
in a covered pot and then remove the lid just after the tofu is ready to allow
any residual benzoic acid to evaporate.</P>
      <P>She added that this is also effective for removing hydrogen peroxide.</P>
      <P>The department urged residents of the city to only purchase soybean-based
products produced and sold by reputable companies and retail outlets in order to
avoid substandard products.</P>
      <P>It said that anyone who suspects a food product may not measure up to food
safety standards can report the matter to the municipal government by phoning
the 1999 hot line or dialing (02) 2720-8889.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan expects progress in U.S. arms procurement in September</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New York,  Aug. 1 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan hopes the United States will make progress in pushing through its arms
procurement  requests in September, following the conclusion of the Beijing
Olympic Games later this month, Taiwan's Legislative Yuan speaker Wang Jin-pyng
said in the United States Friday.</P>
      <P>Wang made the remarks prior to his departure from New York for Taipei after
wrapping up his nine-day U.S. visit that also took him to Washington, D.C.</P>
      <P>Wang said he had good discussions with U.S. officials on the arms issue and that
the process should have helped resolve U.S. doubts about Taiwan's determination
to acquire the weapon systems.</P>
      <P>Wang said the U.S. side repeatedly reassured him that the administration of
President George W. Bush has not frozen arms sales to Taiwan and will definitely
comply with related provisions of the Taiwan Relations Act in handling the
matter.</P>
      <P>According to the speaker, if the items are to be passed before the U.S. Congress
adjourns on Sept. 16, the Bush administration would need to submit notifications
for the weapon systems to Congress for review by Aug. 16, midway through the
Beijing Olympics, which end Aug. 24.</P>
      <P>"We hope there will an outcome in September," he said.</P>
      <P>Wang said he does not think China will try to pressure the United States into
scrapping the deals during Bush's upcoming China visit to attend the Aug. 8
Olympic opening ceremony, because they are requests that have been under
discussion for a long time.</P>
      <P>There have been reports that the Bush administration is holding back on the
congressional notifications so as not to upset relations with China ahead of the
Olympic Games.</P>
      <P>Timothy Keating, commander of the U.S. Pacific Command, fueled speculation last
month that Washington might indeed have frozen the screening process when he
talked about defense ties with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He said policy-makers in the administration have "reconciled Taiwan's military
posture, China's current military posture and strategy that indicates there is
no pressing, compelling need for, at the moment, arms sales to Taiwan."</P>
      <P>The list of military hardware reportedly being held up include anti-tank
missiles,  Apache helicopters,  Patriot PAC-3 missile batteries, diesel-powered
submarines, P3C anti-submarine aircraft and sea-launched Harpoon missiles.</P>
      <P>However, in response to Keating's remarks, the U.S. Department of State
reiterated that Washington has not changed its policy on arms sales to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said July 18 that the administration
"faithfully implements the Taiwan Relations Act" and that there is an "internal
interagency process" for the U.S. government to consider all military exports,
including sales to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"When the interagency process achieves a final decision for specific arms sales,
we will notify Congress," he said.</P>
      <P>Concerned about the administration's delays in screening the pending weapon
sales to Taiwan, a group of 23 members of the U.S. House of Representatives sent
a joint letter to Bush July 31 urging his administration to expedite
consideration of the sales.</P>
      <P>Also, the group of congressmen, led by Shelley Berkley (D-Nev.) and Steve Chabot
(R-Ohio) , co-chairs of the Congressional Taiwan Caucus, requested that the
administration brief Congress on the status of sales.</P>
      <P>The move came one month after a group of 14 senators sent a similar letter to
Bush June 30.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Ball teams to miss out on cash award if they finish last in Beijing</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Are Taiwan's taxpayers ready to pay NT$21.6 million to reward a team finishing
in last place at the Beijing Olympics?</P>
      <P>The Sports Affairs Council decided on Friday that they were not, issuing revised
guidelines that will require Taiwan's baseball and softball teams to finish at
least sixth in their eight-team Olympic tournaments to earn cash prizes.</P>
      <P>The council announced on Friday adjustments to its guidelines on paying "Guo
Guang scholarships" and awarding medals to athletes who excel at the Olympic
Games to account for the specific competition formats of the 15 events in which
Taiwanese athletes are entered.</P>
      <P>Under the Sports Affairs Council's existing program, athletes finishing in the
top eight in their events are eligible for cash awards.</P>
      <P>Gold medalists will receive NT$12 million, silver medalists NT$7 million, bronze
medalists NT$5 million, fourth-place finishers NT$3 million, fifth- and sixth-
place finishers NT$1.5 million and seventh- and eighth-place finishes
NT$900,000.</P>
      <P>But the council faced a dilemma as the Olympic baseball and softball tournaments
feature only eight teams.</P>
      <P>Had the baseball team finished last in its event, which would likely include an
embarrassing loss to host China, each of its 24 players would still have
received NT$900,000, or a total of NT$21.6 milion, under existing guidelines.</P>
      <P>Under the revised reward program, the baseball and softball teams will receive
monetary rewards if they place sixth or better and will receive a medal for
finishing seventh.</P>
      <P>The original guidelines will still apply to athletes competing in track and
field, swimming, weightlifting, archery, shooting, rowing, sailing and cycling.</P>
      <P>In taekwondo and judo,  competitions that finish with two third-place, fifth-
place and seventh-place finishers, local athletes will be awarded based on those
placings.</P>
      <P>In tennis, badminton and individual table tennis events, where no distinction is
made between quarterfinal losers (fifth to eighth place) , local athletes in
those tournaments who are ousted in the quarterfinals will receive an NT$1.2
million award.</P>
      <P>Medal winners will be able to collect their rewards in a lump sum or as a
lifetime monthly annuity, with gold medalists earning NT$75,000 per month,
silver medalists NT$38,000 per month and bronze medalists NT$24,000 per month.</P>
      <P>Taiwan will send 80 athletes to the games, to be held in Beijing Aug. 8-24. They
will hope to improve on the country's showing in Athens in 2004, where Taiwan
won a total of five medals, two golds, two silvers and one bronze.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's four entries in taekwondo could all contend for medals, depending on
their draws and the mood of the often arbitrary judges. Taiwan's archery teams
are also seen as having chances to repeat their medal-winning performances at
Athens.</P>
      <P>Other hopefuls include Chuang Chia-jung and Chan Yung-jan, who hope to overcome
some stiff competitors from China, Spain, Ukraine and the United States to win
glory in the women's doubles in tennis.</P>

      <P>The second of five groups of local Olympians will set off for Beijing, China, on
a China Airlines (CAL) flight via Hong Kong Sunday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Olympic delegation, comprising 80 athletes and 57 coaches and
administrators, is heading to Beijing in five separate stages based on their
different competition timetables, with Sunday's group the biggest of them all.</P>
      <P>Headed by Chef de Mission Tsai Szu-chuen and Chinese Taipei Olympic Committee

      <P>The first group of Olympians -- five weightlifters and a sailor -- and their
coaches left for China Thursday.</P>
      <P>Athletes competing in tennis, softball, women's table tennis, and track and

      <P>Taiwan's four taekwondo athletes, who are likely to carry the aspirations of
their country for gold on their shoulders, and their coaches will leave for
Beijing on Aug. 15, ahead of the opening of the taekwondo competition on Aug.
20.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Chu Mu-yen hopes to become the country's first repeat gold-medal winner
as he defends the under 58-kilogram flyweight crown he won in Athens in 2004.</P>
      <P>The travel schedule will enable popular tennis players, Chan Yung-jan and Chuang
Chia-jung -- dubbed the "Golden Doubles Duo" -- to take part in the Games
opening ceremony Aug. 8.</P>
      <P>Chan and Chuang were runners-up in women's doubles at two grand slam events --

      <P>The Taichung City Government promoted Saturday a hot line targeting male victims
of domestic violence ahead of Father's Day on Aug. 8 to help them overcome their
disinclination to seek help for fear of losing face.</P>
      <P>Jhang Guo-huei, chief of the city's Department of Social Affairs, reminded the
public that the 0800-013999 hot line was set up especially to provide male
victims a viable channel to deal with their problems and urged victims of abuse
not to hesitate to call.</P>
      <P>"Confined by their traditional social image, most men suffering from domestic
violence lack the courage to speak up, resulting in many male victims hiding in
different corners of society, " Jhang noted.</P>
      <P>According to statistics compiled by the city's domestic violence and sexual
assault prevention and control center, a total of 784 cases of violence among
married couples were reported in the city during the first six months of this
year, and in 6 percent of the cases, or 47, the victim was the husband.</P>
      <P>The results of a survey of 512 residents released Saturday by a Taichung-based
civil group revealed that 85 percent of respondents had no idea there is a hot
line for male victims of domestic violence.</P>
      <P>Among the 174 male respondents, only 20 percent said they would ask for help in
the event of them becoming a victim.</P>
      <P>The reasons mentioned by respondents for not seeking help included that doing so
would embarrass them or make them laughed at by others and that the hot line
number was difficult to remember.</P>

    <HEADLINE>President to define his concept of 'workable diplomacy'</HEADLINE>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou will meet with former foreign affairs ministers Sunday to
discuss his ideas on the nation's diplomacy, Presidential Office spokesman Wang
Yu-chi said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Wang said Ma will host a dinner in honor of former foreign affairs ministers at
the Taipei Guest House during which he will address his concept of "workable
diplomacy."</P>
      <P>Ma first floated the notion, under which Taiwan would engage China in discussing
Taiwan's international space, during a trip overseas while serving as chairman
of the Kuomintang between 2005 and 2007.</P>
      <P>Ma will also visit the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Monday to discuss the idea of
a "diplomatic truce" between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>"The president hopes to elaborate on his ideas on Taiwan's diplomacy through the
two events," the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>Wang noted that the previous administration, under then-President Chen Shui-
bian, had engaged in "bull in a china shop" diplomacy, which although helping
Taiwan gain new diplomatic allies, also let many more slip away.</P>
      <P>Taiwan currently maintains diplomatic relations with 23 nations.</P>
      <P>"The new government cannot identify with the confrontational and scorched-earth
approach adopted by the previous administration, " Wang said.</P>
      <P>A Presidential Office official said "workable diplomacy" will form the basic
tenet of Taiwan's diplomatic activity.</P>
      <P>Ma has stressed in the past that China and Taiwan should stop their "meaningless
competition" in the international community, and that the two sides should not
only stop the diplomatic tug-of-war, but should also improve cross-strait
relations.</P>
      <P>The improvement of cross-strait relations will form the basis of the nation's
diplomatic development, the official added.</P>
      <P>Since Ma's inauguration on May 20, frosty cross-strait relations have gradually
thawed, with Taiwan easing restrictions on commercial exchanges and opening
weekend cross-strait charter flights.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Eden Social Welfare Foundation on Saturday urged the government to
strengthen training programs for the disabled in preparation for a new
regulation that will create more job openings for people with disabilities next
year.</P>
      <P>Under revisions to the Protection Act for Rights and Interests of (Physically
and Mentally) Disabled Citizens that will take effect next July, at least three
percent of the positions at public companies, government agencies and education
institutions with staffs of more than 34 workers should be reserved for the
disabled.</P>
      <P>Also, private enterprises and institutions with staffs of more than 67 workers
will be required to staff 1 percent of their workforce with disabled workers.</P>
      <P>At present, the staffing requirements only apply to public institutions with at
least 50 employees and private companies with at least 100 employees.</P>
      <P>The foundation estimates that the law's revisions will create 4,000 job
opportunities for the disabled next year.</P>
      <P>"Having a mental or physical disability is not equal to lacking capability, "
said Huang Jow-song, the foundation's chief executive officer, who hoped that
the value of the labor of local disabled workers would be reassessed.</P>
      <P>Advertising  executive  Jerry Fan,  himself confined  to a wheelchair, urged
enterprises to hire more disabled people, who are, he said,  stable and
optimistic  and have high EQ (emotional quotients).</P>
      <P>"If you think that blind people can only make a living by giving massages, they
will never have a chance to do other things, " Fan said.</P>
      <P>Fan gained prominence for his political commercials that helped former President
Chen Shui-bian win the presidency in 2000 and later was one of the organizers of
a campaign to oust Chen in 2006 because of suspected corruption in the
Presidential Office and the first family.</P>
      <P>Dorothy Tao, president of the Chinese Human Resource Management Association,
said that while the existing law had helped some disabled individuals to find
jobs, there were still companies that preferred to be fined rather than adjust
their hiring practices.</P>
      <P>Citing a survey that the foundation conducted in July, Tao noted that more than
70 percent of employers are satisfied with the attitudes of disabled workers on
the job.</P>
      <P>Many of them, however, also criticized professional training programs for the
disabled as not meeting their needs.</P>
      <P>Tao acknowledged that the programs provided by the government and welfare
organizations may be outdated and not aligned with Taiwan's labor market, and
stressed that cooperation between the government, welfare organizations and the
private sector was necessary to raise the employment rate of disabled people.</P>
      <P>The foundation said existing training programs tend to focus only on document
processing, which is already a basic skill in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In 2006, the unemployment rate among the disabled was about 15 percent,
according to the foundation, nearly four times higher than the 3.92 percent rate
for society as a whole.</P>

      <P>Nine foreign women and 22 men have been arrested in Yunlin County in south-
central Taiwan for involvement in the sex trade, the Coast Guard Administration
said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Coast guard said the nine women -- three from Vietnam, five from Indonesia and
one from the Philippines -- were engaged in prostitution.</P>
      <P>Of the 22 men, some were customers while others were suspected of being involved
in smuggling the women into Taiwan.</P>
      <P>All 31 suspects were turned over to the Yunlin Prosecutors Office by the coast
guard after questioning.</P>
      <P>The coast guard noted that the nine women had not had HIV tests administered by
health authorities, and suggested their customers may be at risk of contracting
the sexually transmitted disease.</P>
      <P>Coast guard officials said the latest raid followed a previous bust in the
county July 29, in which a human trafficking ring formed by a trio of two
Taiwanese men, Tsai Hsi-yen and Sun Wen-ping, and a Vietnamese woman was taken

    <TEXT>
      <P>Peng Meng-hui, the founder of Studio Classroom, is a household name in Taiwan, a
symbol of learning English for many generations of Taiwanese citizens.</P>
      <P>The name Studio Classroom and the image of the silver-haired teacher Peng tend
to well up in their minds when they study English.</P>
      <P>Now at 82, Doris Brougham, Peng's real name, is still energetic and exuberant.
She gets up early to work, recording English classes in the studio, editing
English teaching magazines, learning computer skills and teaching swimming and
music.</P>
      <P>She has even secured a diving license, enabling her to roam beneath the sea to
get a closer look at the dazzling marine world.</P>
      <P>Having grown up in a classic American Christian family in Seattle, Brougham
traveled to China in 1948 at the age of 21 to serve as a missionary.</P>
      <P>Three years later, she evacuated to Taiwan due to the civil war raging on the
Chinese mainland. She has since taken residence in Taiwan and has obtained
permanent residency status.</P>
      <P>Local Christian groups organized a thanksgiving concert Saturday to celebrate
Broughan's 60th anniversary in Asia. Sixty pastors from three generations
gathered to extend their highest esteem for her through lyrical songs.</P>
      <P>Many of her students from around Taiwan also attended the concert to express
their gratitude for her tireless service in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Broughan remained humble despite the praise and thanks heaped on her. After 60
years of dedication to ministering, education and social services, Broughan said
she has never thought of retirement.</P>
      <P>"I always think that I'm in my 60s. The celebration party only reminded me and
even let more people know that I'm actually 82 years old," she jokingly
complained.</P>
      <P>Broughan recalled that her life is full of challenges and surprises. "Whenever
an ideal or goal occurs to me, I tend to strive to realize it. I never thought
that I might not be able to do it or easily abandon the goal," she recalled.</P>
      <P>When she was young, she admired the sound of the trumpet and immersed herself in
music study. She attended a music college and received a diploma after
completing a rigorous musical education. In Taiwan, she has not only taught
English on air but also music at many local colleges and universities.</P>
      <P>Full of curiousity, Brougham finds interest in many things. She began to learn
scuba diving at the age of 56 and began to learn computers at 60.</P>
      <P>"I never think that I'm old. Keep on going is my motto. Now, I not only have a
diving license and have often taught others swimming and diving. I'm now also a
computer geek and I'm trying to promote English study online," she added.</P>
      <P>With three-fourths of her life spent in Taiwan, Brougham said she still has many
dreams to be realized. "Retirement is not in my dictionary," she added.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's economy was still underdeveloped when Brougham arrived in the island.
She first worked in Hualien, a backwater on the country's east coast.</P>
      <P>She traveled around rugged mountain villages for five years, ministering to
aboriginal people there. Later on, she moved to Taichung and then Taipei to
spread the Christian faith, recording radio programs to get out the word of the
gospel.</P>
      <P>In those years, many Taiwanese students were not good at English and were too
poor to study English at cram schools. She decided to dedicate herself to
English education, founding Radio Classroom to offer English courses over the
air.</P>
      <P>On Aug. 1, 1962, the Studio Classroom English radio program was broadcast for
the first time and over the years became a "mecca" of English study for many
young Taiwanese students.</P>
      <P>Over the years, Brougham has also spent much time raising funds for
disadvantaged people and prison inmates.  She sent Studio Classroom magazines to
prisons and encouraged inmates to study English to enrich their lives.</P>
      <P>Saying Taiwan has become part of her life, Brougham said she will stay here for
good. "I hope Taiwan will 'keep on going' like me," she said.</P>

      <P>A Beijing 2008 Olympic Games torch appeared at the Taipei Computer Application
Show Saturday and will be on display until the event ends Monday.</P>
      <P>The torch was flown in from Beijing Saturday morning but it was unclear if it
had been used in any part of the torch relay that circled the world amid
controversy earlier this year, or if it was a spare model held in reserve.</P>
      <P>The main Olympic torch currently touring China was in Tianjin Friday and
Saturday and was scheduled to circle Sichuan province for three days beginning
Sunday before returning to Beijing.</P>
      <P>The worldwide Olympic torch relay did not stop in Taiwan due to protests against
a move by the Beijing Games organizers to list Taiwan as one of the domestic
stops on the route.</P>
      <P>Benjamin Ou, general manager of the Lenovo Group's Taiwan branch, said that the
show provided a rare occasion for people in Taiwan to view the torch, which was
designed by Lenovo, the largest personal computer manufacturer in China.</P>
      <P>It took 10 months for a premium design team organized by Lenovo and comprised of
34 specialists in 10 scientific fields to create the torch, Ou said.</P>
      <P>Named "xiang yun, " literally "lucky clouds, " the torch was selected for the
2008 Olympic Games after beating out the designs of 387 other international and
Chinese teams.</P>
      <P>Ou said the torch's design was inspired by three elements -- the traditional
Chinese symbol that represents "luck, " paper, one of four major inventions of
the Chinese people, and the color red, which represents good fortune and joy in
Chinese culture.</P>
      <P>On the Beijing Olympic Games's official Web site, the torch, made of aluminum,
is said to embody the concepts of a "Green Olympics, a High-tech Olympics and
the People's Olympics."</P>
      <P>The torch relay triggered protests in many countries, coming soon after
Beijing's bloody suppression of a protest launched by monks in Tibet in March
that called for greater cultural and political autonomy.</P>

      <P>Lin Liang-chun, 69, a fisherman from the remote Niaoyu islet in offshore Penghu
County, shined with joy after being honored as a "model father" Saturday, but
expressions of sadness still flashed on his wrinkled face when he reflected on
the life of an old fisherman.</P>
      <P>A resident of Niaoyu since birth, Lin said there was once a time when local
fishermen could always depend on a good catch of silver herring.</P>
      <P>Now, he lamented, the area's fish resources seemed exhausted as the size of
local catches were slumping badly. This year, fishermen caught no fish at all in
the traditional silver herring season in July, Lin said.</P>
      <P>Without fish to catch and constant hikes in fuel prices, Lin said, he has seldom
ventured out on his fishing boat over the past few months and has survived on
the NT$6,000 monthly pension he receives from the central government.</P>
      <P>He did sail his own boat to Makong, the main island of the Penghu archipelago
off the western coast of Taiwan, for the award ceremony, even if it cost him
NT$500 in gasoline to make the trip.</P>
      <P>Despite his hardships, Lin received the honor for raising four children on
limited means and participating in social welfare activities to help his fellow
islanders.</P>
      <P>He now hopes that the government will understand the difficult life he and other
fishermen like him face and take better care of them in the future.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou ordered the Taipei county government Saturday to come up
with a comprehensive flood control plan within one month.</P>
      <P>Ma gave the directive after inspecting a water pumping station in the northern
county's Sinjhuang City to review its Taliaokeng River cleanup and flood control
work.</P>
      <P>The president was accompanied by Premier Liu Chao-shiuan, Taipei County
Magistrate Chou Hsi-wei, Deputy Magistrate Lee Hung-yuan and Sinjhuang Mayor Hsu
Ping-kun.</P>
      <P>Lee, a hydraulic power expert, said Taiwan has spent much money on flood control
projects over the past years, but the results have been lackluster.</P>
      <P>Noting that the Legislative Yuan already passed an eight-year NT$110 billion
special budget for various flood prevention projects around Taiwan and is
expected to pass another budget plan worth NT$40 billion in the near future, Lee
said he doesn't think that all those projects will be able to settle Taiwan's
thorny flooding issue once and for all because they were designed with "old
thinking."</P>
      <P>"Traditional ways, such as building sluice gates, embankments and pumping
stations, cannot resolve our nightmarish flooding problems," Lee noted, adding
that Taiwan needs a new way of thinking to tackle the issue.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that flood prevention work requires a broad vision and
comprehensive planning, Lee said the central government should not have had a
single agency -- the Water Resources Agency under the Ministry of Economic
Affairs -- assume the tough task solely.</P>
      <P>"Inter-agency coordination as well as cross-city and cross-county cooperation
are needed to draw up and carry out a comprehensive flood control project," Lee
explained.</P>
      <P>In his view, Lee went on, the existing Taliaokeng River flood control project
embodies the flaw of the logic of traditional flood prevention measures.</P>
      <P>Under the existing project which was initiated  by Chou's predecessor Su Tseng-
chang, the Sinjhuang water pumping station has been built, which can pump out
100 tons of floodwater a second. To date, the project has cost more than NT$8
billion and an additional NT$2 billion will be spent in the future.</P>
      <P>But Lee said the river's upperstream is located in neighboring Taoyuan County
where many land development projects have been underway. During stormy days,
floodwaters in the Taliaokeng River often reach 250 tons per second.</P>
      <P>"Against this backdrop, the pumping station is no cure to the nightmare of
flooding in Sinjhuang, " Lee lamented, adding that building a water catchment in
Taoyuan County will be a more effective way to alleviate the headache.</P>
      <P>Echoing Lee's view, President Ma said he hopes the Taipei county government can
come up with a new macroview flood prevent project within one month for the
Cabinet's reference.</P>
      <P>For his part, Premier Liu said that if necessary, the central government will
assist in cross-county coordination to facilitate flood control work.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Liu said he will direct the central-level Water Resources Agency to
refer to Taipei county's flood prevention experience in reviewing various flood
control projects in other parts of the country in two weeks.</P>

negligent and slack in carrying out its Mirage spare parts procurement mission.</P>
      <P>According to the United Evening News, the logistics command spent six months
procuring just 41 of the more than 400 Mirage spare parts that the air force
needed to meet it emergency demand. The shortage embodied the command's serious

      <P>Taiwan's departing representative to the United States stressed on Saturday the
importance of maintaining close ties with Washington and suggested that Taipei
give U.S.-Taiwan relations priority over relations with other countries and
areas.</P>
      <P>"The  administration  should  make  efforts  to  bolster Taipei-Washington
relations as its top diplomatic and national security strategy," said Joseph Wu,
who wrapped up his 15-month stint as Taiwan's top representative in the U.S.
capital Friday.</P>
      <P>Wu and his wife and son departed from Washington, D.C., Saturday for Los
Angeles, where they will spend one day before heading back to Taiwan Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Wu, the first Democratic Progressive Party member to serve as Taiwan's top envoy
to the U.S., said before leaving the U.S. capital that he felt proud to have
lived up to his promise to act in the interests  of the country rather than any
specific  party in strengthening U.S.-Taiwan relations.</P>
      <P>"My most important achievement is traveling all over America and raising
Taiwan's visibility in the U.S. and the world, " Wu said.</P>
      <P>He explained that over the past 15 months, he has toured around America to meet
U.S. officials, academics, mass media and mainstream Americans to sell Taiwan
and help U.S. leadership and opinion leaders better understand it.</P>
      <P>Wu said he is especially moved and appreciative of the support he received from
Taiwanese expatriates across the U.S. during his tenure.</P>
      <P>He was originally scheduled to return to Taiwan July 26 but stayed on for
another week in order to host four visiting legislative delegations, including
one led by Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng.</P>
      <P>The lawmakers were in Washington, D.C., recently mainly to iron out U.S.
concerns and doubts about Taiwan's plans to purchase defensive weapon systems
from the U.S.</P>
      <P>Wu is being  succeeded  by Jason  Yuan,  Taiwan's  former representative to
Canada who has been the Kuomintang and People First Party representative to the
United States since 2004.</P>
      <P>Yuan, set to assume office Monday, said recently that his top priority after
assuming the post will be to mend fences with the United States and rebuild
mutual trust.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Buddhist Tzu Chi Foundation is urging the people of Taiwan to be more earth-
friendly by changing some of their rituals during "ghost month" -- the seventh
month of the year according to the lunar calendar.</P>
      <P>Master Cheng Yen, a Buddhist nun and founder of the foundation, is spearheading
a campaign to turn "ghost month" into an "auspicious month" by encouraging
people to change worship rituals that are detrimental to the earth's
environment.</P>
      <P>During this year's "ghost month," which runs from Aug. 1 through Aug. 30, many
local residents will observe the time-honored tradition of offering sacrifices
and burning incense and ghost paper money in temples or in front of their homes
to appease the wandering spirits.</P>
      <P>According to legend, on the first day of the ghost month, the gates of the
netherworld are opened to allow the ghosts a month of feasting in the land of
the living.</P>
      <P>The Ghost Festival -- the high point of "ghost month" that comes on the 15th day
of the seventh lunar month -- is mainly a Taoist practice.</P>
      <P>It coincides with the Buddhist Ullambana Festival on the same day when monks
will feed hungry ghosts to deliver them from suffering in the spirit of
promoting filial piety.</P>
      <P>In an appeal posted on its Web site, the Tzu Chi Foundation urged people
observing the festival not to burn ghost money, because every kilogram of paper
money they burn will release 1.5 kilograms of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere
-- a practice that will cause air pollution and harm human health.</P>
      <P>The foundation quoted a United Nations task force as saying that humans are 90
percent responsible for the global warming problem, which has triggered repeated
natural disasters and plunged mankind into a crisis that should not be
neglected.</P>
      <P>"The resources on earth are limited. Insatiable human desires will only bring
unfathomable calamities. The single best solution lies in reducing greenhouse
gas emissions," the foundation said.</P>
      <P>The foundation called on people to donate the funds originally intended for
burning ghost money to charities and use flowers and fruit in lieu of animal
sacrifices for their worship rituals.</P>

      <P>People who lobby government officials for help will be required to register and
publicly disclose their activities beginning Aug. 8, when the Lobbying Act goes
into effect.</P>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan passed the lobbying bill in July 2007, making Taiwan the
third country after the United States and Canada to enact such legislation.</P>
      <P>The law defines lobbying as any direct contact with lobbyable public officials,
by verbal or written means, with the purpose of influencing the official's or
his agency's attitude toward the formation,  enactment,  passage,  alteration
or  annulment  of legislation, policies or initiatives.</P>
      <P>Lobbyists can be individuals, legal entities, or civic groups soliciting help on
their own behalf or individuals or corporations that lobby on behalf of others.</P>
      <P>The lobbyable officials are elected or appointed public officials at national or
local levels, including the president, vice president, elected representatives,
heads of local governments and political appointees.</P>
      <P>The legislation prohibits lobbying on matters related to national defense,
foreign affairs, China policy, national security, civil servants' duties, or the
activities of foreign governments or international nongovernmental organizations
in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to the legislation, agencies that are potential targets of lobbyists
must designate a special unit or official to accept the lobbyists' registration.</P>
      <P>Within seven days after being approached, the officials should register with the
designated unit or official to record the date, venue, method and content of the
activity.</P>
      <P>Lobbyists must also report lobbying expenditures to the concerned agencies by
May 31 every year, and the concerned agencies should publicize financial reports
quarterly.</P>
      <P>Within three years of their leaving office, the president, vice president,
political appointees appointed by the president and heads of local governments
cannot lobby, in person, through their proxies or on behalf of others, agencies
that they served in for five years before leaving office.</P>
      <P>Any foreign governments, legal persons or groups intending to lobby Taiwan
public officials must entrust a domestic lobbyist to do so on their behalf.</P>
      <P>However, no individuals, legal entities or groups from China, Hong Kong and
Macau are allowed to lobby Taiwanese public officials, regardless of whether
they lobby directly or operate through proxies.</P>
      <P>In addition, any persons who have been convicted of sedition, treason, graft,
organized crime, fraud, embezzlement or breach of trust are forbidden from
lobbying on others' behalf.</P>
      <P>Incumbent elected representatives and their associates cannot lobby for
enterprises that they operate or those in which they have a stake of more than
10 percent.</P>
      <P>Any undisclosed lobbying activities, violations of the revolving door
restrictions, and unlawful lobbying by elected representatives and their
associates are punishable by fines of up to NT$2.5 million (US$82,000),
according to the legislation.</P>
      <P>The National Teachers' Association welcomed Sunday the imminent implementation
of the act, saying that it would force lobbying activities to move in a more
positive direction as the law requires open and transparent operations.</P>
      <P>The John Tung Foundation, an anti-smoking group seen as one of the most
effective nonprofit lobbying groups in Taiwan, also welcomed the legislation,
but worried it would give commercial interests a greater edge in influencing
legislation and policy-making.</P>
      <P>Lin Ching-li, a foundation official in charge of public affairs, said the
requirements forcing lobbyists to register in advance and report their
expenditures afterward would considerably increase the administrative costs of
social welfare groups but have little impact on wealthier corporate interests,
such as tobacco companies.</P>
      <P>Lin was concerned the moneyed interests would end up "crowding out" the voices
of public interest groups.</P>
      <P>Lin Lu-hung,  a top aide to Democratic Progressive  Party Legislator Huang Sue-
ying was also skeptical.</P>
      <P>"There will be a big grey area between 'lobbying' and 'written requests,'" the
legislative aide said, noting that lawmakers' offices receive many written
requests for help every day.</P>
      <P>Since the Lobbying Act does not regulate written pleas from constituents, future
lobbyists may use this option to make their case, which would force legislative
aides to determine on their own if these documents constitute "lobbying" or are
simple "requests for help, " Lin Lu-hung said.</P>
      <P>If they were defined as "lobbying, " the aide wondered if that meant
constituents would have to register their approach in advance.</P>
      <P>"Just thinking about having to help register on behalf of others gives me a
headache," she lamented.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Stung by criticism from the victims' families, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
(MOFA) said Saturday it would continue to assist in search efforts for seven
Taiwanese nationals missing off the coast of Madagascar since July 11, even
after the first round of search operations ends Sunday.</P>
      <P>The ministry said in a statement that it understands the sorrow of the victims'
families and would continue to provide whatever help necessary to continue the
search,  such as translation, legal consultation and other technical assistance.</P>
      <P>The help will be given through a 13-member task force composed of Taiwanese
expatriates in Madagascar and former diplomatic officials posted in the country,
the statement said.</P>
      <P>The ministry's statement was issued after members of two of the victim's
families returned to Taiwan from southern Africa and expressed their
dissatisfaction over the ministry's handling of the incident and over reports
that it has decided to stop funding the search for those missing.</P>
      <P>Eight Taiwanese businessmen went missing July 11 after the boat they chartered
to tour an ocean aquaculture facility off the coast of northeastern Madagascar
ran into trouble.</P>
      <P>Among them, Liu Shou-chin was found dead July 14.</P>
      <P>Following the conclusion of the first phase of search operations, the ministry
insisted it would continue to keep in touch with relevant rescue agencies in
Madagascar and send personnel stationed in South Africa to help the families
deal with the aftermath of the incident.</P>
      <P>Since learning of the case, the ministry has assigned more than 160
tasks/missions to staffers and overseas diplomatic officials and spent over NT$3
million to help with the search mission, including arranging for a 10-hour
helicopter search, a 22-hour aircraft search and 32-hour search at sea, but to
no avail, the statement said.</P>
      <P>The ministry attaches great importance to the search mission and has been
providing legal assistance to the families as prosecutors in Madagascar are
still waiting for the results of an investigation to determine the cause of the
incident.</P>
      <P>The ministry also said it was told that Madagascar rescue teams have not stopped
their search for the missing businessmen.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) is looking into why a MOFA Web page
listing examples of China's suppression of Taiwan has not been updated since the
end of last year, but denied it had anything to do with the government's desire
for a "diplomatic trucewith China.</P>
      <P>"We are now looking into the matter and will update the information as soon as
possible, MOFA spokesman Henry Chen told the Central News Agency.</P>
      <P>According to the Chinese-language daily Liberty Times, the foreign ministry
should update the site every three months to inform the public  of incidents  in
which Beijing  thwarts  Taiwan's participation in various international
political, economic, trade, sports or cultural events.</P>
      <P>However, such information has not been updated since December 2007, which the
Liberty Times contended could be misinterpreted by the international community
as an indication that no such incidents had occurred this year.</P>
      <P>The report said Beijing, in fact, has not relaxed its suppression of Taiwan's
international space this year, citing its successful effort to block Taiwan's
bid to join the World Health Organization on May 19 and recent attempts to
downgrade Taiwan by changing the name of Taiwan's Olympic team.</P>
      <P>Although the previous Democratic Progressive Party administration was in power
until May 20, the paper described the failure to update the page as "self-
disarmamentunder the government's "modus vivendi" diplomatic strategy that
involves a "diplomatic truce" with China.</P>
      <P>After taking office May 20, President Ma Ying-jeou declared he would seek
adiplomatic trucewith China in an attempt to end a longstanding diplomatic tug-
of-war between the two countries.</P>
      <P>The goal is to open more international space for Taiwan and halt the competition
for the allegiance of mostly poor nations through offers of large sums of money,
described as "checkbook diplomacy."</P>
      <P>In response to the report, Chen said posting such information is a routine job
similar to posting public travel advisories or information on overseas
diplomatic missions.</P>
      <P>It has nothing to do with a diplomatic truce,he stressed.</P>
      <P>Chen said the government took office May 20 and the foreign ministry did not
know why the previous administration failed to update the information from
January to May.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Regulatory maze restricts imports of fine European foods</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Gourmets in Taiwan may feel frustrated at having to do without Italian Parma
ham, fresh foie gras, or other fine meat-related items from Europe that are
being kept out of Taiwan by the country's time-consuming and complex export
application procedures.</P>
      <P>During an informal  conversation  with Central News Agency reporters, a
frustrated European diplomat complained that they were denied access to some
high-quality European foods because of the byzantine Sanitary and Phytosanitary
Measures (SPS) imposed by Taiwan's authorities.</P>
      <P>He thought it was a shame that local gourmets, including himself, are being
deprived of the pleasures of some of the finest foods in the world.</P>
      <P>According to the Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection and Quarantine,
only ham from Hungary, Sweden, Denmark, Holland and Finland has been approved to
be exported to Taiwan, leaving the famous Italian prosciutto di parma out of
reach.</P>
      <P>As for fresh fois gras, don's even think about it unless you can evade the
stringent SPS regime.</P>
      <P>"It may take a long time, from several months to two or three years, for foreign
companies to complete the filing of an (export) application, " said a bureau
official, and even then, there is no guarantee the permit will be granted.</P>
      <P>The official said the European exporter is first required to file an application
with Taiwan's government, before local officials visit the company for an on-
site inspection.</P>
      <P>More often than not, those foreign companies give up in the initial stage, faced
with an endless barrage of questions that can prove overwhelming, said the
European diplomat who insisted on anonymity.</P>
      <P>"But Taiwan's regulations  are not stricter than in other countries, " the
Taiwanese official argued, adding that Italian and French companies have never
filed an application.</P>
      <P>The official admitted that some individuals may bring in small quantities of
foie gras or ham from abroad, but that is a matter for the Customs' Bureau to
investigate when travelers arrive at Taiwan's international gateways.</P>
      <P>Regardless of the restrictions on certain delicacies,  top restaurants in Taiwan
still have to find a way to satisfy, or lure, clients with deep pockets who care
little of the price tag.</P>
      <P>When approached by CNA reporters, chefs and owners of those restaurants
described the dilemma they faced between following regulations and serving
heavenly dishes.</P>
      <P>A law-abiding owner of a French restaurant in Taipei said that in the case of
fresh foie gras, he followed the government's regulations and tried to make do
with less flavorful canned foie gras, or by using chicken and duck livers as a
substitute.</P>
      <P>But some restaurants admitted that they can still find access to obtain
ingredients that have not been approved for import.</P>
      <P>"It is always possible to get fresh foie gras through certain traders, " a
person in charge of a high-class French restaurant said candidly. "We can find
everything in Taipei."</P>
      <P>His restaurant provides genuine foie gras to satisfy fastidious clients, but
certainly the price doesn't come cheap.</P>
      <P>As a pragmatic businessman, he admitted it would not serve his interests to
stubbornly negotiate with government agencies on the issue.</P>
      <P>Whether merely strict or in fact excessive, SPS measures often constitute non-
tariff trade barriers. But the European diplomat noted that since the trade
volume is too small, the EU has not considered bringing the case to the World
Trade Organization.</P>

      <P>A sedan caught fire in the Hsuehshan Tunnel shortly after noon Sunday, but
firemen from Taipei County were able to rush to the scene within 10 minutes to
put out the blaze. No one was injured.</P>
      <P>According to the National Highway Traffic Control Center, the car was traveling

allowing firemen to reach the scene swiftly and extinguish the fire.</P>
      <P>The 12.9-km Hsuehshan Tunnel is the second longest road tunnel in East Asia and

according to statistics released Sunday by the city government's Department of

      <P>The statistics show that 276 residents of Kaohsiung -- Taiwan's second largest
city -- committed suicide last year, comprising 173 men and 103 women.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Kaohsiung Mounted Police Unit, the brainchild of former acting Mayor Chen
Chi-mai, has become a white elephant in the cash-strapped harbor city and may
soon be disbanded.</P>
      <P>After failing to find a stable that will lease them horses, the 20-odd police
officers of the unit, which was one of Chen Chi-mai's proudest achievements,
could soon be laid off.</P>
      <P>Founded in 2005, the unit became the country's first mounted police force and
was the pride and joy of the city with its members chosen among the ranks of the
city's policemen for their good looks and excellent physical condition.</P>
      <P>They spent a month and a half developing their horsemanship and were dressed in
specially designed uniforms that carried a price tag of more than NT$100,000
(US$3,256).</P>
      <P>When they were on duty, usually at the city's scenic sites, tourists rushed to
take photos of them sitting atop their horses.</P>
      <P>The then-acting mayor created the unit to boost tourism in the city, and, in
fact, it was always more of a tourist magnet than a force dedicated to
maintaining law and order, as it rarely issued tickets or fines.</P>
      <P>The fate of this beautiful prop now hangs in the balance, as no stable has been
willing to lease horses to the unit for the NT$6 million budget earmarked by the
city for the purpose.</P>
      <P>Under the contract proposed by the city, the stable must provide four horses for
the unit per day on weekdays and more than four on weekends and holidays when
more visitors descend on the city's popular scenic areas.</P>
      <P>That means the contracted stable needed to send out its horses 500 times a year
for NT$6 million, or NT$12,000 per horse per day out on Kaohsiung's streets.</P>
      <P>It may sound lucrative, but with the prices for horse feed and other items
needed to care for the horses having increased sharply recently, no bidder is
interesting in the contract, leaving the officers of the unit stranded in their
splendid uniforms in their office since the beginning of this year.</P>
      <P>Many city councilors have branded the mounted police unit as a whim of Chen Chi-
mai and called for its dissolution, but Mayor Chen Chu is reluctant to ax it out
of concern that it will offend her predecessor in City Hall.</P>
      <P>With half of the year already gone, the officers of the unit are still confined
to their office waiting anxiously, wondering if they will ever again be able to
rejoin their equine partners on duty.</P>

    <HEADLINE>China to get less of Taiwan's outward investment in 2008</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The share of Taiwan's outward investment directed at China is expected to
decline dramatically this year as a result of China's harsher investment
climate, a Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) official said Sunday.</P>
      <P>MAC Vice Chairman Fu Dong-cheng predicted new outward investment by Taiwanese
businesses in China this year will be less than 50 percent of all local
investment made abroad, a steep decline from China's 60.7 percent share in 2007.</P>
      <P>Fu said the share of local investment headed to China is declining due to its
implementation of a new labor contract law and higher corporate income taxes
since the beginning of the year, coupled with an appreciating Chinese currency.</P>
      <P>Citing statistics compiled by the Investment Commission, Fu said "China fever"
hit its peak in 2005, when 71.7 of Taiwan's outward investment was directed at
China.</P>
      <P>He attributed the 2005 figure to regulatory approvals allowing contract
chipmakers Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and United Microelectronics
Corp. to produce less sophisticated wafers in China.</P>
      <P>In 2006, the amount of China-bound Taiwanese investment declined to constitute
63.9 percent of Taiwan's total outward investment, a figure that shrank further
to 60.7 percent last year, Fu noted.</P>
      <P>The MAC vice chairman believed that the continuing decline in 2008 reflected the
growing trend of Taiwanese businesses to further globalize their operations and
recognition that China is no longer necessarily the best option.</P>
      <P>Since the implementation of China's new labor contract law at the beginning of
the year, the owners of Taiwanese companies in China who did not have well-
structured human resource policies have seen their labor costs rise,
particularly for workers who have served over 10 years.</P>
      <P>At the same time, corporate income taxes for businesses located in China's
coastal cities have risen to 25 percent from the 15 percent  preferential  tax
that was previously  in place  for foreign-invested companies.</P>
      <P>Exporters in China have also had to contend with the appreciating Chinese yuan,
which has gained 18 percent in value compared to the U.S. dollar since July
2005, when the Chinese authorities reformed statutes governing currency
exchange.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's Philharmonia Moment Musical, a non-professional symphony orchestra,
gave the opening concert at the Young Euro Classics Festival in Berlin Friday
and earned the acclaim of an audience of nearly 1,500 people.</P>
      <P>The festival is one of the few music festivals dedicated to the advancement of
international youth orchestras and the promotion of new compositions.</P>
      <P>Since it was founded in 2000, the festival has each year attracted more than 10
orchestras composed of top young musicians from all over the world to show off
their talent.</P>
      <P>The festival is considered to be one of the most important events on the city's
summer calendar.</P>
      <P>This year's concert was opened by Philharmonia Moment Musical, conducted by
young violinist Chiang Ching-po and composed of around 65 musicians aged 17-28.
It marked the first time an orchestra from Taiwan had performed at the festival.</P>
      <P>Although Germany maintains close economic and cultural ties with Taiwan, its
people's understanding of Taiwan is still limited, and the concert gave Germans
a good opportunity to get to know Taiwan better, an official from the Berlin
city government said prior to the performance.</P>
      <P>This year's festival will also include concerts staged by orchestras from China,
Germany, Britain, Finland, Azerbaijan and Kazahstan, the official added.</P>
      <P>The repertoire of the Taiwanese ensemble included Lai Deh-ho's "Moment Musical"
-- a concerto for the bamboo flute, a wind instrument called a "xiao, " the
"pipa, " or Chinese lute, and a chamber orchestra -- and Mahler's Symphony No.5.</P>
      <P>At the end of their performance, the young musicians were given a standing
ovation, and the conductor stepped forward and bowed many times thanking the
audience for its applause.</P>
      <P>Chiang said he was proud of the ensemble members' performance since they had to
overcome many challenges in performing a concert in a foreign country.</P>
      <P>Lu Li-li, head of the group, said it was an unforgettable memory for all of the
members to perform in an international music festival, but worried that the
orchestra still was NT$2 million short of the NT$7 million it has cost to
perform overseas.</P>

      <P>We want everybody to know that we will not use the stopovers (in the United
States) to do anything that conflicts with the purpose of transit stops, Ma
said.</P>
      <P>"We hope that such efforts will be fully understood and will reverse some of the
distrust (between Taiwan and the U.S.) that has resulted in the past eight
years.</P>
      <P>Ma will stop over on the west coast of the U.S. on his way to and from Latin
America during his Aug. 12-19 trip.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a dinner attended by former foreign ministers at the Taipei Guest
House, Ma said his concept of "workable diplomacy, " formally translated by his
aides as a "modus vivendi" strategy, built on their work.</P>
      <P>The spirit of workable diplomacy is very much in line with the 'pragmatic
diplomacy' promoted by former foreign ministers in the past, Ma said.</P>
      <P>"That is how to use the strength we have -- hard power and soft power -- to
cement ties with diplomatic allies and expand cooperation with other
countries,he said.</P>
      <P>The strategy's goal, the president said, is to safeguard the rights of the
Republic of China while consolidating diplomatic relations with allies and
restoring mutual trust with countries that heavily influence Taiwan even without
formal diplomatic ties.</P>
      <P>Those concepts will be tested during his trip to Latin America, where he is
scheduled to attend the inauguration of Paraguayan President-elect Fernando Lugo
on Aug. 15, and the inauguration of Dominican President-elect Leonel Fernandez
Aug. 16.</P>
      <P>Lugo hinted during his campaign that he was considering breaking ties with
Taipei to recognize Beijing.</P>
      <P>Noting that bilateral relations between Taiwan and China play an important part
in the island's foreign diplomacy, Ma said that the significantly improved and
stable relations between Taipei and Beijing since he took office on May 20 have
also contributed to a better relationship with the U.S.</P>
      <P>I'm pleased to see that U.S. President Bush expressed his satisfaction two days
ago regarding current relations on both sides of the Taiwan Strait,he said.</P>
      <P>In an interview Friday in Washington with the Peoples Daily and the Central
China Television network on the eve of his trip to Beijing to attend the opening
of the Olympic Games, Bush said that relations between Taiwan and China are
currently in abetter place."</P>
      <P>Since Ma's inauguration on May 20, frosty cross-strait relations have gradually
thawed, with Taiwan easing restrictions on commercial exchanges, opening weekend
cross-strait charter flights and allowing in more Chinese tourists.</P>
      <P>President Ma was joined at the dinner by Kuomintang honorary Chairman and former
foreign minister Lien Chan, KMT Chairman Wu Poh-hsiung, National Security
Council Secretary-General Su Chi, foreign minister Francisco H.L. Ou, and former
foreign ministers Frederick Chien, Ting Mao-shih, Jason Hu, Tien Hung-mao and
Chen Chien-jen.</P>
      <P>Ma will also visit the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Monday to discuss the idea of
adiplomatic trucebetween Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>He has stressed in the past that China and Taiwan should stop theirmeaningless
competitionin the international community and also improve cross-strait
relations.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Try lobbying law first: legislative speaker</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 4 (CNA)
08/04/08  12:14:32
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Commenting on the impending institution of the Lobbying Act, Legislative Yuan
Speaker Wang Jin-pyng said although there is ample room for improvement
regarding the design and implementation of the law, people should try it first
and discuss it later.</P>
      <P>"It surely takes time before a law can be legislated perfectly and implemented
smoothly," Wang said.</P>
      <P>With the Lobbying Act slated to go into effect Aug. 8, Wang suggested that the
people try to live with it and reach a consensus on questionable points and then
seek amendments to eventually perfect the law.</P>
      <P>"Amendments can be made in the future, if necessary," he added.</P>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan passed the lobbying bill in July 2007, making Taiwan the
third country after the United States and Canada to enact such legislation.</P>
      <P>The law defines lobbying as any direct contact with lobbyable public officials,
by verbal or written means, with the purpose of influencing the official's or
his agency's attitude toward the formation,  enactment,  passage,  alteration
or  annulment  of legislation, policies or initiatives.</P>
      <P>Lobbyists can be individuals, legal entities, or civic groups soliciting help on
their own behalf or individuals or corporations that lobby on behalf of others.</P>
      <P>The lobbyable officials are elected or appointed public officials at national or
local levels, including the president, vice president, elected representatives,
heads of local governments and political appointees.</P>
      <P>People who lobby government officials for help will be required to register and
publicly disclose their activities, according to the law.</P>
      <P>Within seven days after being approached, the officials should register with the
designated unit or official to record the date, venue, method and content of the
activity.</P>
      <P>Lobbyists must also report lobbying expenditures to the concerned agencies by
May 31 every year, and the concerned agencies should publicize financial reports
quarterly.</P>
      <P>Any undisclosed lobbying activities, violations of the revolving door
restrictions, and unlawful lobbying by elected representatives and their
associates are punishable by fines of up to NT$2.5 million (US$82,000),
according to the legislation.</P>

    <HEADLINE>More foreign enterprises thinking about moving away: local job bank</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  August 4 (CNA)
08/04/08  14:02:59
(By Yeh Fang-hsun and T.C. Jiang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A recent poll conducted by a local job bank showed that over one-third of
Taiwan-based foreign enterprises have no plans for recruitment this year and
more than half of them are cutting back on personnel costs, with over 2 percent
planning to close their Taiwan operations.</P>
      <P>"With the slowdown in global economic growth and widespread inflation thinning
the consumer market everywhere, internationally based enterprises are suffering
a bigger blow than locally based ones," 1111 Job Bank's Chief Operating Officer
(COO), Ryan Wu said at a press conference at which he announced the poll results
Monday.</P>
      <P>According to official tallies updated in June, there are 3,271 foreign companies
currently registered in Taiwan. Although there is no clear evidence to indicate
that most of these companies are thinking about moving out, there have been some
recent runaway cases such as British department store Marks &amp; Spencer and
Japanese hypermarket Jusco, both of which closed their Taiwan business in the
last eight months.</P>
      <P>"Some 71.89 percent of the respondents in the poll said their business in Taiwan
is shrinking compared to a year earlier," said Wu, citing a major problem facing
foreign enterprises in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He said out of the 51.35 percent of respondents that indicated they are cutting
back their expenses in the personnel area because of global inflation, 5.26
percent said they will retreat from Taiwan, which means that 2 percent of the
total 185 companies surveyed are likely to quit the Taiwan market.</P>
      <P>In addition, out of the 30.81 percent of respondents that said they have no
recruitment plans for this year, 8.77 percent indicated that they intend to
leave Taiwan, which also points to around a 2 percent departure, Wu said.</P>
      <P>The results of the poll, conducted between July 18 to August 1, should send a
warning to the government that Taiwan needs to improve its market conditions to
entice foreign companies to stay, as they have been playing the important  role
of spurring  industrial development in Taiwan's economy, Wu stressed.</P>
      <P>"In addition to the negative global economic outlook, the changes in Taiwan's
policies could also lead to falling revenues among foreign companies," the COO
noted.</P>
      <P>Wu suggested that the government upgrade local industries to higher knowledge-
and-technology-concentrated business models, while putting together a better
academic-industry cooperation plan in a bid to create more specialized human
resources.</P>
      <P>"With these potential changes, more international companies could be attracted
to invest in Taiwan and increase their stakes here, " Wu said, adding that more
jobs would also be created.</P>
      <P>Representatives  of foreign  enterprises  said at the news conference that the
admission of more visitors from China as well as an injection of Chinese
investment in Taiwan could help to improve the situation.</P>
      <P>"As part of the service sector, we look forward to more cross-Taiwan-Strait
visitors, " said Hiraide Soji, president of the Japanese Yakinku Restaurant in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He noted that over 1 million Taiwanese workers, who are paid relatively higher
than most local employees, are based overseas, especially in China.</P>
      <P>"The return of those workers with high purchasing power could bring more
business opportunities to the service sector, " said Hiraide.</P>
      <P>In another survey conducted by the job bank to identify the foreign companies
that local office workers find most ideal, Citigroup Inc. topped the financial
sector, Google Inc. the service industry and 3M Co. the manufacturing industry.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 80.28 percent of the office workers surveyed said they wanted to work
for foreign companies so that they could obtain good benefits, have a positive
outlook on the companies' future and improve their foreign language skills.
However, that percentage was lower than last year's 96.03, the job bank said.</P>
      <P>In making their top picks from a multiple choice list, 56.8 percent of the
respondents said they favored U.S. companies, 47.36 percent Japanese companies
and 24.06 percent selected Singaporean companies.</P>
      <P>The poll collected 1,187 valid samples, with a margin of error of plus or minus
2.8 percent at a 95 percent level of confidence.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Thirty-five orphans from a shelter in Malawi founded by Taiwan-born Dharma
Master Hui Li paid a call on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) Monday to
express their gratitude to the MOFA for its long-term support of humanitarian
aides in Africa.</P>
      <P>The group of children, many of whom were orphaned by AIDS, are all from the
Buddhist Amitofo Care Center (ACC) in Blantyre, a large commercial city in
southern Malawi.</P>
      <P>In addition to performing songs in Mandarin to express their sincere
appreciation to the foreign ministry for its help over the years, the children
also presented a short Taiwanese folk opera act. The presentation, which won
resounding applause, was included Sun Tsui-feng, lead actress and wife of the
founder of the well-known Ming Hwa Yuan Taiwanese Opera Company.</P>
      <P>Over the past 17 years, the foreign ministry provided the greatest support to
help us send love from Taiwan to Africa, " said Master Hui Li. "I believe that
such humanitarian care and charity are what Taiwan should demonstrate to the
world."</P>
      <P>Praising Master Hui Lis devotion in helping impoverished families and educating
thousands of children in Africa, MOFA Vice Minister Lin Yung-lo said that "these
accomplishments are not only a reflection of Buddhist beliefs, but also of the
kindness and concern of the people of Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Seeing just how happy, optimistic and polite you children all are, I see in you
a bright future for Africa and a reflection of the love that the people of
Taiwan have shown you," he said. "I very much hope that the warmth and
enthusiasm you feel here will make you want to call Taiwan your second home."</P>
      <P>Fourteen-year-old Musiyen, who studied Chinese for three years, told the Central
News Agency in Chinese that he would like to thank his Taiwanese  adoptive
parents for the chance to receive an education.</P>
      <P>"When I grow up, I would like to become someone like Master Hui Li so that I can
help other children like myself," he said.</P>
      <P>During its trip to Taiwan Aug. 2-19, the group is slated to perform singing,
dancing, Taiwanese folk opera and Shaolin kungfu in major Taiwan cities,
including Taipei, Kaohsiung, Taichung, Tainan and Chiayi.</P>
      <P>The Amitofo Care Center, operated by the Amitofo Care Association (ACA), has
provided shelter, care and education for more than 2,000 Malawian orphans since
its establishment in 2001.</P>
      <P>ACA is building a similar care center in Zimbabwe, which will become operational
early next year.</P>
      <P>Dedicated to helping African children whose lives have been affected by AIDS,
Hui Li has traveled around many African countries, including Malawi, Swaziland,
South Africa, Zimbabwe and Cameroon.</P>
      <P>Over the past 16 years, he has adopted or provided care and shelter for nearly
10,000 African AIDS orphans, earning the sobriquet African monk,while many
children call him "daddy sent by Buddha."</P>

      <P>Flower prices on the wholesale market Monday were up more than 20 percent in
Taipei City ahead of Chinese Valentine's Day, which falls on Aug. 7 this year.</P>
      <P>According to the Taipei Flower Auction Co., the average price of a bundle of
flowers reached NT$71.9 (US$2.35), up 22 percent over the previous trading day's
level.</P>
      <P>The volume of flowers traded amounted to 95,809 bundles, up 17 percent over the
previous trading day, the company said.</P>
      <P>A flower industry source said that despite the increase, flower prices are
roughly the same as during the period prior to Chinese Valentine's Day last
year.</P>
      <P>He suggested that consumers shouldn't worry about being forced to dish out large
amounts for a bouquet for their loved ones, as a wide variety of roses -- the
typical Chinese Valentine's Day flower of choice -- will be available at prices
ranging from about NT$100 to NT$4,000 per bundle.</P>
      <P>"You don't have to buy the most expensive kind of rose on the market, because
after all, it's the thought that counts when giving a gift," he said.</P>

      <P>Legislative Speaker Wang Jin-pyng said Monday that his just-concluded U.S. visit
was aimed at strengthening ties between the two countries in order to
consolidate Taiwan's national security and help cross-Taiwan Strait interactions
advance in a more peaceful and cooperative manner.</P>
      <P>Wang made the comments while speaking with reporters outside the Legislative
Yuan one day after his return from a nine-day visit to the U.S. at the
invitation of the Heritage Foundation, which included stops in New York City and
Washington, D.C.</P>

      <P>He said that although Taiwan and the United States are old friends, the
relationship needs a "new beginning" and "new mutual trust" in order to
strengthen the decades-old friendship between the two sides.</P>
      <P>Wang related that he met with National  Security  Council Secretary-General Su

      <P>Residents in Taipei City should pay special attention to the hygiene conditions
in places where they buy cold noodles, a popular dish in the hot Taiwan summer,
a city health official said Monday.</P>
      <P>The warning came after the city's Department of Health recently inspected 25
cold noodle products, 11 of which selected from local convenience stores, three
from hypermarkets and 11 from other stores and vendors.</P>
      <P>The inspection was aimed at checking levels of bacteria, hydrogen peroxide and
borax in cold noodle products, said Chiang Yu-mei, director of the department's
Food and Drug Division.</P>
      <P>Initially, 10 of the samples failed to pass health standards, Chiang noted,
adding that the health department demanded immediate improvements but later

    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party's caucus in the Legislative Yuan
submitted a request Monday for the newly reinstated Control Yuan to investigate
18 cases, including the assassination attempt on former President Chen Shui-bian
on the eve of the 2004 presidential election.</P>
      <P>The caucus also urged Control Yuan president Wang Chien-shien to make sure that
the watchdog body does not become a platform for political conflict.</P>
      <P>Ker Chien-ming, convener of the DPP caucus, noted that two of the 18 cases
involved Wang himself when he was finance minister from 1990-1992.</P>
      <P>Ker said that Wang in his capacity of finance minister had authorized the
establishment of 16 new banks in Taiwan, leading to huge losses to the
government's coffers and financial chaos. In addition, Wang may have served the
interests of the ruling Kuomintang by selling public lands at a low price, Ker
said.</P>
      <P>"We don't want to see the Control Yuan become another platform for political
conflict or a tool for sparring between different political forces, " said Ker
in front of the Control Yuan before he filed the request to investigate the 18
cases.</P>
      <P>He specifically challenged Wang's impartiality, saying that Wang is a man of
political ideology and only intends to investigate cases involving the former
DPP government.</P>
      <P>Wang has vowed to investigate major scandals in the Chen's former
administration, including an attempt to forge diplomatic ties with Papua New
Guinea through brokers, and the establishment of the "Taiwan Goal" company to
handle arms procurement deals.</P>
      <P>Ker urged that the Control Yuan investigate the election eve attempt on Chen's
life on March 19, 2004.</P>
      <P>"This case has been the cause of division among Taiwan citizens, therefore, the
Control Yuan should fully investigate it and let the public know the truth," Ker
said.</P>
      <P>Chen Feng-yi, the Control Yuan Secretary-General, said later that Wang did not
respond to Ker's remarks concerning the two cases in which the Control Yuan
president was allegedly involved.</P>
      <P>The Control Yuan is not a place for political posturing, the secretary-general
added.</P>
      <P>He promised that all petitions filed by individuals or policial caucuses will be

    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) caucus in the Taichung City
Council lashed out at Taichung Mayor Jason Hu Monday for traveling abroad last
week as a typhoon swept through Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Members of the DPP caucus hung banners in front of the Taichung city hall,
claiming that Hu ignored the Taichung residents' safety and wellbeing during
Typhoon Fung Wong while he was in the South Pacific island nation of the
Marshall Islands.</P>
      <P>"Hu should be fully aware of his job description as mayor, which is to take care
of the Taichung residents and oversee the city's development, rather than
promoting Taiwan's diplomacy abroad like a foreign minister," said Chen Shu-hua,
a DPP city councilor.</P>
      <P>Chen described as "deceitful and full of holes" Hu's explanation late last week
that he had traveled to the Marshall Islands "at the request of an upstairs
authority."</P>
      <P>Noting that Hu, a former minister of foreign affairs, was paid by the Ministry
of Foreign Affairs to make the trip to the Marshall Islands, Chen asked exactly
how much Hu was paid and for what purpose.</P>
      <P>"Is there something wrong with Taiwan's diplomatic relations with the Marshall
Islands, or is the sitting Minister of Foreign Affairs Francisco H.L. Ou is so
inept that he has to ask Hu to travel to the South Pacific nation to mend fences
there?" Chen asked.</P>
      <P>Hu was one of the local government chiefs who have been taken to task by the DPP
recently for making overseas trips during the typhoon period. The others include
Taitung Magistrate Kuang Li-chen and Taipei Magistrate Chou Hsi-wei.</P>
      <P>Kuang offered her apologies to Taitung residents upon her return from Germany
Monday.</P>
      <P>Chou, who returned to Taiwan from Nanjing, China last week, ahead of schedule as
Typhoon Fung Wong approached the island, announced Monday that he has canceled
his plan to visit Beijing for the opening of the Olympic Games and will not go
abroad again until the beginning of 2009.</P>

      <P>The Kaohsiung Organizing Committee (KOC) said Monday that the opening and
closing ceremonies of the 2009 Kaohsiung World Games will center on themes that
display Taiwan and Kaohsiung's special characteristics.</P>
      <P>The committee  made the comments  ahead  of its scheduled announcement on Aug. 8
of the winning bid to organize the activities and performances for the opening

      <P>In order to make the three-hour ceremonies as dazzling and attractive as
possible in showcasing Kaohsiung and Taiwan, the KOC has allocated NT$140
million (US$4.56 million) to the arrangement of the events.</P>
      <P>Liu Hsiou-mei, deputy head of the Kaohsiung city government's Department of
Cultural Affairs, said that as the 2009 World Games will represent the first
time that Taiwan is hosting a major international sporting competition, the
government will definitely select a bidder whose proposals for activities and
performances at the ceremonies focus on showcasing the value of the local
culture.</P>
      <P>She said that in order to market the upcoming games, the KOC recently held a
presentation in Taipei City to invite bids from companies in Taiwan's capital,
ranging from TV stations to cultural companies, to organize the ceremonies.</P>
      <P>Liu added that various Taiwan high-technology companies have shown an interest
and have expressed the hope that the ceremonies will incorporate technological
elements to display Taiwan's modernity and advancement.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Hsu Chau-chuan, chief executive officer of the KOC, said that the
three-hour ceremonies will include 99 minutes of thematic performances, and he
expressed the hope that these events will "let the world see Taiwan and

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Monday that cross-Taiwan Strait detente will not
affect Taipei-Tokyo ties, as the situation will benefit the entire region,
including Japan.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks during a meeting at the Presidential Office with a group of
visiting Japanese dietmen led by Tetsurou Yano.</P>
      <P>He assured his Japanese visitors that the long-term friendship between Taiwan
and Japan will not be eroded by improved links between Taiwan and China, because
warming Taiwan-China relations will help forge peace and prosperity in the
strait, which is in Japan's best interests.</P>
      <P>Noting that he is fully aware that some pro-Taiwan Japanese dietmen are deeply
concerned that improvements in cross-strait links might undermine Taipei-Tokyo
ties, Ma said that "the aim of pursuing cross-strait peace is to build peace and
prosperity in the region, and a positive development in this regard will be
beneficial to East Asia, and certainly Japan."</P>
      <P>Ma said he is upbeat about the prospects of Taiwan-Japan relations, as current
Japanese Premier Yasuo Fukuda and then Foreign Minister Taro Aso seemed to also
endorsed this viewpoint during a meeting in 2006 when he visited Japan. Fukuda
was a dietman at that time.</P>
      <P>Taiwan  also welcomes  improving  China-Japan  ties,  since cross-strait peace
and prosperity is a common desire among East Asian countries, and Taiwan is
poised to move in this direction, he said.</P>
      <P>Over the past half century, Japan has had to carefully weigh the leverage
between Taiwan and China within a confined space, he pointed out. However, he
went on, this should be eased as Taiwan-China relations continue to improve.</P>
      <P>The United States, which has a huge stake in the region, has found itself in a
similar position, with President George W. Bush having expressed pleasure
recently over the improved cross-strait ties, he said.</P>
      <P>Ma also highly praised the efforts by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the
Mainland Affairs Council to improve Taiwan's ties with China, the United States
and Japan since he took office May 20.</P>
      <P>Commenting on a collision that took place last month between a Taiwanese
recreational fishing boat and a Japanese coast guard patrol ship near the
disputed Tiaoyutai Islands northeast of Taiwan, the president said he supported
at the time a peaceful and rational resolution to the dispute.</P>
      <P>"My viewpoint and stance in this regard fully coincided with that of Prime
Minister Fukuda," he noted.</P>
      <P>"Those who see me as anti-Japanese might not have read my three books that delve
into the Tiaoyutai issue, " he argued, adding that all the resolutions he
suggests in his books are peaceful and rational.</P>

made by Hsinchu Mayor Lin Jung-tzer's have helped him improve his performance.</P>
      <P>Charles H.C. Kao, founder of the Global Views monthly, also said in the face of
controversy and accusations that local government chiefs are squandering
taxpayers' money with their frequent traveling that Lin should "make more
overseas visits if needed." The mayor has made 17 such visits over the past two
years.</P>
      <P>"Lin is not only concerned about the needs of the public, he is also keen on
joining the world," Kao said.</P>
      <P>The controversy has been further fueled by a trip made by Taitung Magistrate
Kuang Li-cheng to Europe when Typhoon Fung-Wong battered her county, but Kao
said that what counts is not the number of visits made but rather the purposes
and itineraries of such trips.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks as he honored Lin at Hsinchu City Hall for ranking first in

Lin was first, followed by Taichung Mayor Jason Hu and Taoyuan Magistrate Eric

      <P>Lin for his part said he has learned a great deal as a result of his overseas
visits, citing as examples the sofas made of turf with floral decorations that
he ordered to be placed at Shihpachien mountain -- a popular spot among the
locals -- after a visit to Thailand, while a trip to Malaysia gave him the idea
of deploying garbage collecting vehicles that patrol the city emptying the
municipal street-side garbage cans.</P>
      <P>Lin noted that "it takes time to find the best way forward for city development.
This time can be shortened if we learn directly from other countries."</P>

      <P>The Taipei city government is confident that the city's Neihu Mass Rapid Transit
(MRT) line will start commercial operations by the end of next June as
scheduled, Mayor Hau Lung-bin said Monday.</P>
      <P>An extension of the existing Muzha line, the Neihu line starts where the Muzha
line ends at the Zhongshan Junior High School Station and finishes at the Taipei
Nangang Exhibition Center.</P>
      <P>The city government began testing the trains Sunday, and a full series of test
rides, evaluations and adjustments will be carried out once all of the line's 12
stations are completed in December, said Chang Chi-te, commissioner of Taipei
City's Department of Rapid Transit Systems.</P>
      <P>Hau, meanwhile, called for the understanding of residents living near the new
line and the Muzha line for any inconvenience caused by the tests, most of which
will have to be carried out late at night.</P>
      <P>Spanning 14.8 km, the line has 12 stations, including the Taipei Songshan
Airport, which will allow passengers to travel between the Taipei Main Station
and the airport in 14 minutes -- about half the time it takes to make the trip
by road, said Chang.</P>
      <P>The line's automatically controlled trains are produced by Canada's Bombardier
Corp. and are equipped with luggage racks to provide convenience for passengers
heading for the airport, he went on.</P>
      <P>The new line will provide much easier access to the city's Neihu and Nangang
areas, which will be even further improved with the inauguration of the Nangang
line, which is scheduled to be completed by 2010 and will connect with the Neihu
line at the Taipei Nangang Exhibition Center, Chang said.</P>

      <P>Coastal patrol officers seized nearly 60 metric tons of contraband fish from a
Taiwanese fishing vessel in waters off the Taipei County in northern Taiwan
Sunday,  the Cabinet-level Coast Guard Administration (CGA) reported Monday.</P>
      <P>According to the CGA, the fish was discovered aboard the Yungsheng, a fishing
boat registered in Hsinchu County, when it was caught allegedly trying to
smuggle its cargo into Taiwan from waters off Taipei County's Fugui Cape Harbor.</P>
      <P>The skipper, surnamed Hsu, and his crew of four told the CGA officers that they
bought the 56,626 kg of squid and mackerel, among others, at a harbor in China's
Fujian Province, intending to resell the fish in Taiwan to chalk up greater
profits.</P>
      <P>Fujian Province lies opposite Taiwan across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>As the fish appeared abnormally white in color, the CGA officers suspected that
the fish might have been processed with illegal substances in order to preserve
it better.</P>
      <P>The smuggled fish, which had an estimated market value of about NT$10 million
(US$328,947) , was confiscated and destroyed, the CGA officers said, adding that
the case has been handed over the Taoyuan Prosecutors Office for further
investigation.</P>
      <P>The CGA warned the public not to consume smuggled products even if the lower
prices are enticing, and urged them to report suspicious items to a special 118
hotline to help safeguard public health and stamp out trade in contraband goods.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's state-owned postal company on Monday restored its original name,
Chunghwa Post Co., reversing the former  pro-independence  Democratic
Progressive  Party  (DPP) administration's controversial move 18 months ago to
change the firm's name to Taiwan Post Co.</P>
      <P>At a ceremony held in the auditorium of the company's head office in Taipei,
chairman Wu Min-yu announced that effective immediately, the company will be
renamed Chunghwa Post Co. -- a name it first adopted when the postal service
became a company fully owned by the Ministry of Transportation and Communication
in January 2003.</P>
      <P>The move was made in line with a resolution adopted in April by the ruling
Kuomintang (KMT) -dominated Legislative Yuan,  which required the company to
reinstate its original name within six months on the grounds that the previous
name change in February last year was illegal.</P>
      <P>According to Wu, it will cost about NT$8 million (US$260,000) to have the
signboards at all the post offices in the nation replaced again. The amount was
less than the NT$12 million for the previous name change, because the post
offices have kept the old signboards.</P>
      <P>The former DPP administration decided to change the name of the firm to Taiwan
Post Co. on the grounds that this would help avoid confusion, because "Chunghwa"
means "Chinese" or "China" in the Chinese language. Many observers saw the move
as part of a broad campaign to highlight Taiwan's distinct identity.</P>
      <P>Subsequent efforts by the DPP administration to amend the Postal Service Act and
amend a statute on the establishment of the Chunghwa Post Co. failed in the KMT-
controlled legislature, leaving the name change without a firm legal basis.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Cross-strait trust should be extended to diplomatic arena: president</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 4 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Monday that the idea of "workable diplomacy" is
based on the hope that both Taiwan and China will be able to extend the mutual
trust restored in the past few months to the international arena, so that the
two sides can work out a dialogue pattern on the issue of Taiwan's international
space.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks during a visit to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) in
which elaborated on his ideas of a "diplomatic truce" between Taiwan and China
and his concept of "workable diplomacy, " formally translated by his aides as a
"modus vivendi" strategy.</P>
      <P>"Just as I said in my inauguration speech, if Taiwan continues to be isolated in
the international community, there will be no meaningful growth in cross-Taiwan
Strait relations, " Ma said. "The two are inter-dependent," he added.</P>
      <P>The president said the reconciliation of bilateral relations should be extended
to the diplomatic arena.</P>
      <P>"Diplomatic truce does not mean vacation time, but it should mean the end to
vicious competition or the wasting of resources to lure each other's allies, and
it should mean treating each other's people according to humanitarian
principles," Ma said.</P>
      <P>He noted that the difficulties Taiwan has encountered in the international
community over the years are the result of conflict and confrontation with
China.</P>
      <P>"Diplomacy should not be a zero-sum game and the spirit of `workable diplomacy'
is in line with `pragmatic diplomacy, ' both of which are based on the principle
of pragmatism," the president said.</P>
      <P>Although some might feel the strategy is too idealistic, Ma went on, the key
element for its success is that both Taiwan and China should establish a certain
degree of consensus -- the will to create a mutually beneficial situation for
both countries.</P>
      <P>He said that based on the development of bilateral relations between Taiwan and
China over the past few months, it is obvious that mutual trust is increasing.</P>
      <P>Since  Ma's  May  20 inauguration,  the previously  frosty cross-strait
relations have gradually thawed, with Taiwan easing restrictions  on commercial
exchanges,  allowing weekend direct cross-strait charter flights and opening up
to more Chinese tourists.</P>
      <P>Ma said Taiwan faces a very serious challenge in that not only should the
country try to maintain the status quo in terms of bilateral and multi-lateral
relations with other countries, it should also try to expand the friendships it
already has.</P>
      <P>"We should ponder the question of whether we want to confront China on every
international occasion or whether it is possible for us to find a patter from
which we can talk," he said.</P>
      <P>The president said that given the fact that Taiwan and China are so close to
each other, the two can complement each other in a number of areas and this kind
of development should come naturally, with a minimum of government control.</P>
      <P>"No matter what ideology a government might hold, it cannot use subjective
ideology to change objective reality," he said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs on Monday called for domestic bakeries,
confectioners, supermarkets and other outlets to give consumers relief by
lowering prices on their products made with wheat flour.</P>
      <P>Unlike  other  rising  global  food and commodity  prices, international wheat
prices have actually fell last month, prompting the government to make the
appeal.</P>
      <P>An Economics  Ministry official acknowledged  that Taiwan's bakeries and noodle
makers were still using more expensive wheat flour obtained before prices fell,
because wheat-based products typically don't make it to retail shelves until two
to three months after the wheat is imported.</P>
      <P>But he said that the ministry hopes that such businesses will immediately lower
prices in order to "take care of consumers' feelings."</P>
      <P>Two recent typhoons have accelerated food price hikes, and analysts expect July
inflation to hit 5.0 to 5.6 percent.</P>
      <P>The official added that the ministry has already instructed the state-controlled
Taiwan Sugar Corp. (Taisugar) to take the lead in lowering  prices of flour-
based  products  on the shelves  of Taisugar-run stores.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Vice Premier Chiu Cheng-hsiung said Monday that price cuts in flour
products will be included on the agenda of the Executive Yuan Price
Stabilization Panel's upcoming meetings.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Bureau of National Health Insurance (BNHI) may be forced to issue 800,000
temporary paper insurance cards in the coming months to avoid a potential
conflict of interest between the vendor of the IC cards and Premier Liu Chao-
shiuan.</P>
      <P>The bureau said Monday it had decided not to renew its contract with IC card
supplier Teco Electric and Machinery Co. because the company's chairman, C.K.
Liu, is Premier Liu's brother.</P>
      <P>"Due to the Public Officials' Conflicts of Interest Prevention Act, the BNHI
cannot renew the contract with Teco, " said Chu Tzer-ming, the president and CEO
of the health insurance bureau.</P>
      <P>Teco won an NT$3.8 billion contract in 2001 to issue 1.6 million IC cards per
year, but because of the bureau's decision, Teco will not be able to issue any
cards after the contract expires on August 6.</P>
      <P>Chu said it will take six months to choose a new vendor through an open bidding
process. During that time, the bureau estimates 800,000 people in Taiwan,
including newborn babies, foreign spouses and workers, and people who lose their
cards, will need new cards.</P>
      <P>They will be given temporary paper cards in their place, and will be required to
present them along with their identity cards when they seek health care
services.</P>
      <P>Although Premier Liu was sworn-in on May 20, the bureau said it did not realize
that Teco's chairman was the premier's brother until early June. At that time,
it asked the Ministry of Justice for an interpretation of the conflict of
interest law.</P>
      <P>The ministry informed the insurance bureau in the past week that working with
Teco might violate the law, forcing the bureau to seek a new IC card supplier,
the BNHI said.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, almost every citizen holds a health insurance IC card, which is
nearly as common as an identity card. Since the holder's medical history is
recorded on the chip, the IC card raised privacy concerns when it was first
issued in 2002.</P>

      <P>Financial incentives to draw film and TV producers to Kaohsiung City to shoot
movies and programs have proven effective, with a number of production teams
taking up the offer to film there in the past few months, the city government
said Monday.</P>
      <P>Since Kaohsiung's Department of Information passed a measure earlier this year
to pay subsidies to film or TV producers of NT$300 (US$9.83) per day for each
production team worker, at least 10 films and TV programs have been shot in the
southern port city, a municipal official said.</P>
      <P>Among them was noted director Wu Nien-jen's new film "Take Me to the Faraway
Place." Wu's best-known work is his autobiographical film, "A Borrowed Life."</P>
      <P>"There are many ways and channels to market Kaohsiung, but certainly having film
and TV drama producers shoot scenes in the city is a very good way to show the
beauty of Kaohsiung, " the official from the city's Department of Information
said.</P>
      <P>Under the incentive's provisions, film or TV drama production teams are eligible
to received subsidies of up to NT$600,000, he said.</P>
      <P>The official said that the department has already budgeted NT$1.5 million in
subsidies for producers to help pay for their crews' accommodation and signed a
long-term contract with a hotel which provides rooms to film or TV crews at a
reasonable price.</P>
      <P>The city has also gone out of its way to "provide administrative assistance, "
the official said, in one case lending Kaohsiung's famous "Mounted Police Unit"
to promote a film in late May.</P>
      <P>Another incentive drawn up to encourage film producers to use Kaohsiung as a
backdrop for their stories is an NT$10 million cash award for any picture where
shots of the city account for at least a quarter of its length and that wins an
award at any one of six major international film festivals, such as the Berlin
International Film Festival.</P>

      <P>Taitung County Magistrate Kuang Li-chen arrived at Taiwan Taoyuan International
Airport Monday amid harsh criticism for being away on a 13-day trip to Europe
while her county was being pounded by a typhoon last week.</P>
      <P>Surrounded by reporters at the airport, Kuang, from the ruling Kuomintang,
apologized to Taitung residents for being absent as Typhoon Fung-Wong devastated
her southeast coast county.</P>
      <P>The storm brought heavy rains and floods to central and southern Taiwan,
claiming two lives, including one in Taitung, and causing an estimated NT$1.1
billion (US$35.8 million) in agricultural losses.</P>
      <P>Asked whether she had decided not to fly abroad again for the rest of the year,
the flight attendant-turned-politician nodded in agreement. She complemented
other county officials, including her deputy, who managed the local government's
response to the typhoon.</P>
      <P>She added that although she was overseas when Fung-Wong made landfall between
Taitung and Hualien last Monday, she had monitored information about the
typhoon's movement and damage.</P>
      <P>Kuang explained that her travels aimed to promote Taitung, which she said was a
"dispossessed" place that "no one cares" about in the international community.</P>
      <P>However, that explanation failed to calm a storm of discontent with her and
Taichung Mayor Jason Hu,  also from the ruling Kuomintang.</P>
      <P>Kuang and Hu were the only two of the nation's 25 city and county chiefs who
were not on the island when the typhoon came.</P>
      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party denounced Kuang and Hu for "ignoring
the most important task of a local government leader," which the party said was
to stand together with the people.</P>
      <P>Kuang, who took office on April 17, 2006, is the first female magistrate of the
agricultural county, an economic backwater. She won the post on April 1that year
with 63 percent of the vote.</P>
      <P>Since then, however, her administration has received poor marks. In a survey on
public satisfaction with the performance of 25 county and city administrators
published in July's Global Views Monthly magazine, Kuang ranked dead last.</P>
      <P>Kuang has drawn fire for her frequent overseas visits on the taxpayers' dime.
She has flown abroad eight times over the past two and a half years, visiting
nine countries: Japan, Egypt, Greece, Hong Kong, Britain, Thailand, New Zealand,
Germany and Italy.</P>
      <P>Taichung's Mayor Hu earned the highest public satisfaction ranking in the same
Global Views Monthly view survey, but was also absent when the typhoon hit his
city. At the time, Hu was visiting the Marshall Islands, one of Taiwan's 23
diplomatic allies.</P>
      <P>In his first day at work Monday after returning from his trip, Hu urged the
public not to "smear" the legitimacy of foreign visits by local government
heads.</P>
      <P>Hu said he visited the Marshall Islands to help solidify Taiwan's diplomatic
ties. He said his visit benefited both Taichung and the nation, and that he
never expected to be criticized for the trip.</P>
      <P>Hu said that he had overseen preparations for a possible typhoon before
departing, adding that he believed it was more important to have a good city
government team in place, than for him to remain in Taichung constantly to help
protect the city from storms.</P>

      <P>The Tunnel of Nine Turns -- the most beautiful section of the Taroko National
Park in eastern Taiwan -- will remain closed for at least two days until Aug. 5,
the park administration said Monday.</P>
      <P>Administration officials said the decision to temporarily close the tunnel was
made out of concern for the safety of tourists, because falling rocks along the
walkway inside the tunnel posed a serious hazard.</P>
      <P>The officials explained that the heavy rain brought by Typhoon Fung-Wong late
last month had saturated the rocks with moisture along the walkway in the
tunnel, causing some of the rocks to become loose.</P>
      <P>"If the conditions within the tunnel have become stable, we expect to reopen the
tunnel on Aug. 6," they said.</P>
      <P>The Tunnel of Nine Turns, constructed in 1996, is considered the most
magnificent part of Taroko Gorge.</P>
      <P>The walkway in the tunnel is an ideal place for visitors to feast their eyes on
the natural wonders of Taroko Gorge, where the white marble cliffs face each
other at a distance of only 10 meters, forming a narrow channel for the Kelan
River to rush through.</P>

      <P>Taichung County will hold a four-day musical instrument festival beginning Aug.
7 to promote the central Taiwan county's musical instrument manufacturing
prowess and tourism.</P>
      <P>The festival will be held at a horse farm in Houli township, a small town in the
northern part of the county with a rich 60-year history of producing saxophones,
said Taichung County Magistrate Huang Chung-sheng.</P>
      <P>About two-thirds of the country's saxophone manufacturers are still located in
Houli, which is also known for its jazz drums, guitars, and flutes.</P>
      <P>During the four-day bash, professional groups and individuals, as well as school
bands, will perform on a wide variety of musical instruments, such as the
accordion, harmonica, oboe, violin, cello, piano, flute, and drum, as well as
traditional Chinese instruments.</P>
      <P>Two separate competitions, for saxophonists and jazz drummers, will be held on
the first day of the event, with the drum competition drawing musicians from
around the country.</P>
      <P>Since the festival will be held during Chinese Valentine's Day and Father's Day,
the organizers have all cast some musical performances to create a more romantic
atmosphere for participants, Huang said.</P>
      <P>Those who would rather be in on the action than simply listen to the music will
have a chance to perform themselves, as they can try their hands at a number of
instruments on display in a special pavilion, an attraction has been the show's
most popular feature over the past two years, Huang said.</P>
      <P>Visitors can also bring their own instruments to the festival venue where
experienced instrument makers will provide a "diagnosis" of their instruments in
pursuit of better sound performance.</P>
      <P>For those  interested  in actually  buying  an instrument, festival-goers can
head to the on-site instrument shop to find the best deals with guidance from
professional instrument makers.</P>
      <P>There will also be activities targeted at children, where they can paint their
ocarinas or learn how to play little bamboo flutes, Huang said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A Taiwanese business association in southern China has called on Taiwan's
government to fully subsidize their children's education at schools there, as a
worsening business environment in China has severely eroded their profits.</P>
      <P>Andrew Yeh, chairman of the Taiwan Merchant Association based in the industrial
city of Dongguan in Guangdong province, said Monday that with their businesses
suffering from rising inflation and deteriorating  investment  conditions,  an
increasing number of Taiwanese businessmen in the area can no longer afford the
cost of the special schools set up for their children.</P>
      <P>The negative economic conditions have saddled them with a heavier financial
burden, and many hope Taiwan's government can provide them with full subsidies
for their children's education in China, he said.</P>
      <P>According to Yeh, the parents of two-thirds of the 1,760 students at Dongguan
School for Children of Taiwan Businessmen are merely employees of Taiwanese-
invested companies in the area, with more limited financial means, while the
other third are business owners.</P>
      <P>Now that overseas schools for Taiwanese businessmen's children are viewed as an
extension of the compulsory education system at home, the government should
offer full educational subsidies for their children on an equal basis with those
in Taiwan, Yeh suggested.</P>
      <P>At present, Taiwan's government grants NT$120,000-NT$140,000 (US$4,605) per year
in subsidies to each elementary or junior high school student in Taiwan, Yeh
said.</P>
      <P>But the Taiwan's Ministry of Education provides only some NT$30,000 in financial
aid to each Taiwanese child attending the special schools in China, falling well
short of the average school fees of about 33,000 Chinese yuan (NT$130,000) per
year, he said.</P>
      <P>Yeh urged relevant agencies, such as the Mainland Affairs Council and the
Straits Exchange Foundation, to join with the Legislative Yuan in passing
legislation to provide full economic handouts for the children of Taiwanese
businesspeople in China.</P>
      <P>"Taiwanese kids studying in the schools dedicated to them in China are entitled
to receive an equitable  subsidy from the government in Taiwan, " he contended.</P>

      <P>Hsinchu City, host to Taiwan's best-known science park and some of its most
prominent companies, is one of the best places to live in Taiwan, if population
statistics are any indication.</P>
      <P>The city has seen its population grow faster over the past five years than any
other city or county in the country, according to the results of a survey on
domestic migration released Monday by the Directorate General of Budget,
Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS).</P>
      <P>The survey found that the city's population had grown by 12.1 percent, or 54,000
people, over the past five years, faster than anywhere else in the country,
bringing its total population to 500,000.</P>
      <P>The survey also discovered that 102,000 more people were living in the city than
were officially registered as city residents, a 25.47 percent gap, larger than
any other city or county that recorded such a gap, including Taipei, Taichung
and Tainan cities and Taipei and Taoyuan counties.</P>
      <P>DGBAS officials attributed Hsinchu's popularity to pragmatic public policies,
vigorous industrial and commercial activity, and high-quality employment and
education environments.</P>
      <P>The survey, conducted last November, also found that 7.83 percent of Hsinchu
residents work outside the city, a rate higher only than that of Taipei County
and considerably lower than the national average of 13.71 percent.</P>

      <P>Taiwan will open a cultural center in Tokyo next year, the country's top culture
official said in Tokyo Monday.</P>
      <P>Huang Pi-twan, minister in charge of the Council for Cultural Affairs (CCA) ,
made the remarks during a meeting with Taiwanese journalists posted in Japan.</P>
      <P>Huang, who was invited by Japan's Aichi University to attend an international
seminar, said the planned Tokyo cultural center will be the third of its kind
established by the CCA to introduce Taiwan's culture to foreigners, following
similar ones in New York and Paris.</P>
      <P>Noting that cultural development and publicity has been one of the most
effective vehicles to inspire foreign interest in Taiwan, Huang said Europeans
knew little about Taiwan 20 years ago but now hold it in high esteem because of
exposure to Taiwanese artists.</P>
      <P>World-class movie directors such as Hou Hsiao-hsien, Edward Yang and Tsai Ming-
liang as well as internationally acclaimed performing troupes, including the
Cloud Gate Dance Theater, the Contemporary Legend Theater, Han Tang Yuefu and
U-Theater, have all raised Taiwan's profile internationally, Huang said.</P>
      <P>With this in mind, the CCA is determined to open more cultural centers around
the world in the future to extend its publicity drive and promote international
cultural exchanges.</P>
      <P>Despite its limited budget, the CCA will set up a cultural center in Tokyo in
the coming year, Huang said.</P>
      <P>Initially, the center will be housed in the ground floor of Taiwan's
representive office in Japan, but in the future, the council will find a more
convenient and pertinent location to enhance its efficacy, she said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Huang also revealed that the CCA is working on a blueprint to
transform itself into a ministry in charge of culture and tourism.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that the world's great cultural powers tend to be major tourist
destinations, Huang said she looks forward to expanding the CCA's reach to
tourism to integrate Taiwan's "soft powers" and generate more revenues for the
national coffers.</P>
      <P>"Tourism is not just about foods, cuisine, and natural scenery, but also about
culture," Huang said, adding that tourism revenues can help finance more
cultural development projects.</P>
      <P>In addition to attending the Aichi University  seminar on imperialism and
literature, Huang also visited an exhibition on Taiwan's literary works in
Kanagawa Prefecture during her visit. She departed for home Monday evening.</P>

    <HEADLINE>'Card slave' freed of most of his debts in precedent-setting case</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 4 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>A low-income "card slave" has been forgiven of most of his debts after a court
ruled that he only has to pay about 14 percent of his NT$600,000 credit card
balance.</P>
      <P>"I felt total relief the night the lawyer called me about the court's ruling,"
said Huang, who became the first person in Taiwan to emerge from a cloud of
credit card debt under a court-monitored special settlement mechanism that took
effect in April of this year.</P>
      <P>"I had a good night's sleep, and I don't have to worry any more about repaying
my debts, " Huang said at a news conference organized Monday by the Legal Aid
Foundation, which handled Huang's case and has been the leading proponent of the
credit card debt settlement process.</P>
      <P>The court ruled that Huang will have to pay NT$83,000 over six years to settle
his accounts.</P>
      <P>Although creditor banks argued that the amount is far too low, the court
nonetheless approved his petition for debt forgiveness.</P>
      <P>Huang, who has suffered from polio since childhood, lives on income from selling
recyclables and government subsidies.</P>
      <P>To get married, he borrowed NT$200,000 (US$6,557) from friends and used credit
cards to borrow more money, eventually owing banks about NT$600,000.</P>
      <P>The Legal Aid Foundation helped him petition the court to settle his debts so he
could get a new lease on life. The foundation said Huang would repay his
obligations with whatever money he had left after deducting basic expenses from
his monthly wages and benefits.</P>
      <P>Lin Yung-sung, a lawyer and head of the Legal Aid Foundation, said that when the
court handles such cases, "it attaches great importance to the sincerity of the
debtors in repaying their debts."</P>
      <P>"As long as the debtor's proposal can be accepted by the court, there is no need
to convene a meeting of all creditors. The court will make its own decision,"
Lin said.</P>
      <P>"Whether the debts can be completely repaid will not be the major focus, " he
said, adding that "the court will even take into account rising consumer prices
to gradually reduce the amount repaid over time.</P>
      <P>Citing  Huang  as an example,  Lin said the Cabinet-level Directorate General of
Budget, Accounting and Statistics, has set the minimum living expenses of a
Taipei resident at NT$14,100 per person per month.</P>
      <P>But Huang proposed that he would only deduct NT$9,990 for living expenses for
him and his wife and three meals of NT$100 per person daily, leaving him
NT$1,500 a month with which to make payments during the first 18 months.</P>
      <P>The monthly payments will then be reduced gradually until the NT$83,034 is
repaid over 72 months.</P>
      <P>The court believed that Huang "is not squandering any money, and he is sincere
in repaying his debts."</P>
      <P>Chen Feng-feng, a lawyer with the foundation, said that Huang's case has shown
that card debtors who want to settle their accounts will be able to get aid from
the foundation and other groups in petitioning the court to settle their
problems within their means.</P>
      <P>"Card slave" is a term coined in Taiwan to refer to people who can only pay the
minimum balance on their credit card debt every month. Reports have said that
hundreds of thousands of Taiwanese are struggling to repay their growing debts.</P>
      <P>After dozens of "card slaves" committed suicide because of what they saw as the
hopelessness of their situation, the government and civic groups stepped in to
help card slaves negotiate repayment programs with creditor banks.</P>

      <P>Lawmakers of the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) said Monday that the Chiang Kai-shek
Memorial Hall -- renamed by the former Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
administration as Taiwan Democracy Memorial Hall in May last year -- will have
its original name restored in the next legislative session.</P>
      <P>Legislator Chiang Yi-hsiung, a co-convener of the Education and Culture
Committee, said that during the next legislative session beginning in early
September, he will include on the agenda a resolution by the former DPP
administration to scrap the organic law for the establishment of Chiang Kai-shek
Memorial Hall.</P>
      <P>Chiang said the KMT-dominated  legislature will defeat the resolution, thus
allowing the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall to have its original name restored.</P>
      <P>However, Presidential Office spokesman Wang Yu-chi told reporters later that
there is no urgency in giving back the memorial its original name, and said it
would be better to consult public opinion first in order to form a consensus on
the issue.</P>
      <P>The Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall is a monument erected in memory of the late
President Chiang Kai-shek, who ruled Taiwan for 25 years until his death in
1975.</P>
      <P>On May 19 last year, then-president Chen Shui-bian renamed Chiang Kai-shek
Memorial Hall as National Taiwan Democracy Memorial Hall without going through a
legislative process to provide a legal basis for the new name.</P>
      <P>The name change was part of a campaign by the former DPP administration to rid
the country of vestiges of Chiang, considered by many in Taiwan to have been a
brutal dictator, and boost its popularity.</P>
      <P>The DPP administration forcibly removed statues of Chiang from public places
across the island,  deleted  his name from the international airport in Taoyuan,
and closed his mausoleum in Taoyuan County.</P>

      <P>Controversial Taitung County Magistrate Kuang Li-chen went into hiding Monday
after her return from a trip overseas as prosecutors were trying to summon her
for questioning over suspected irregularities related to her just-concluded
tour.</P>
      <P>Kuang, accompanied by 13 Taitung county government officials and township
chiefs, returned to Taipei Monday morning after visiting several European
countries, including Italy, in the name of learning about their tourism
promotion measures.</P>
      <P>Kuang originally planned to give a news conference  after returning  to the
eastern county of Taitung,  an agricultural backwater, to clarify allegations
that the trip was a reward to her grassroots campaign operatives at taxpayers'
expense.</P>
      <P>A chief Taitung prosecutor led a team of investigators to Taitung's Fengnien
Airport to wait for Kuang and her entourage and bring them in for questioning.
Because of bad weather, the plane returned to Taipei.</P>
      <P>Kuang and her chief secretary Hou Shih-min then took a flight from Taipei to the
eastern county of Hualien that borders Taitung. She originally planned to give a
news conference at the Taitung county government building after her return. But
she went missing after noticing that prosecutors were trailing her car on the
way from Hualien to Taitung.</P>
      <P>Other members of her entourage returned to Taitung in two groups in the evening
and all of them have been taken to the Investigation Bureau's Taitung office for
questioning.</P>
      <P>Kuang came under fire after taking 10 township chiefs and other county officials
on a 13-day trip to Europe in late July despite knowing that Typhoon Fung Wong
was approaching. She has also been criticized for spending millions of
taxpayers' money on frequent overseas trips since taking office two years ago.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Lured by discount, 2.05 million households lower power use</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan Power Co. (Taipower) said Monday that a program to give discount rates to
households that cut electricity consumption is paying dividends.</P>
      <P>An initial estimate by the state-run utility showed that 2.05 million households
cut power use in July to earn the discounts, using 480 million kilowatt/hour
less than last year to save NT$610 million (US$20 million) from their
electricity bills.</P>
      <P>To encourage energy conservation and reduce carbon dioxide emissions, Taipower
increased electricity rates in July by nearly 8 percent for residential users.</P>
      <P>But it offered 5 percent discounts to those families, elementary and high
schools that maintained their electricity consumption at the same level or cut
use by less than five percent compared to the same period last year.</P>
      <P>Those who cut electricity use by between five and 10 percent were to get a 10
percent discount, and those who cut electricity use by more than 10 percent
would get 20 percent off their bills.</P>
      <P>Of the 2.05 million households that consumed less electricity in July from the
same month last year, 70.2 percent of them, or 1.44 million households, cut
power use by more than 10 percent.</P>
      <P>Minister of Economic Affairs Yiin Chii-ming said he was amazed to see the good
result.</P>
      <P>"Handsome rewards can bring out the most valiant, " Yiin said, noting that the
measure had proven effective so far based on the obvious impact of local
residents' cooperation in conserving energy.</P>

      <P>Hsinchu City, host to Taiwan's best-known science park and some of its most
prominent companies, is one of the best places to live in Taiwan, if population
statistics are any indication.</P>
      <P>The city has seen its population grow faster over the past five years than any
other city or county in the country, according to the results of a survey on
domestic migration released Monday by the Directorate General of Budget,
Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS).</P>
      <P>The survey found that the city's population had grown by 12.1 percent, or 54,000
people, over the past five years, faster than anywhere else in the country,
bringing its total population to 500,000.</P>
      <P>The survey also discovered that 102,000 more people were living in the city than
were officially registered as city residents, a 25.47 percent gap, larger than
any other city or county that recorded such a gap, including Taipei, Taichung
and Tainan cities and Taipei and Taoyuan counties.</P>
      <P>DGBAS officials attributed Hsinchu's popularity to pragmatic public policies,
vigorous industrial and commercial activity, and high-quality employment and
education environments.</P>
      <P>The survey, conducted last November, also found that 7.83 percent of Hsinchu
residents work outside the city, a rate higher only than that of Taipei County
and considerably lower than the national average of 13.71 percent.</P>
      <P>On Monday, Hsinchu Mayor Lin Junq-Tzer was awarded by a local media group for
his excellent administrative  performance that "connects the city to the world.
"</P>
      <P>In the 2008 city/county competitiveness survey conducted by the group, he ranked
number one in three categories: "satisfaction with government performance, "
"leader's contribution to the economy" and "city pride."</P>
      <P>The Hsinchu  Science Park hosts the headquarters  of many international high-

      <P>Thirty-one percent of salaried workers in Taiwan are moonlighting and earn on
average an additional NT$22,000 (US$721) per month, a survey conducted by an
online outsourcing company showed Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The survey by www.jcase.com.tw also found that the most common second jobs were
"case by case" jobs at 57.7 percent, followed by Internet auction work and jobs
at special promotional events at holiday plazas or big malls.</P>
      <P>Easing the pressure of high inflation  has been the main motivation behind
looking for second jobs, some 58 percent of salary earners said. The figure was
higher than the 53 percent in 2007 and 34 percent in 2006.</P>
      <P>The survey found that the top 10 items whose price rises have hit salary earners
the hardest are: gasoline, electricity, basic goods such as tissue paper,
natural gas, bread and other baked goods, local delicacies such as meatballs and
oyster omelets, housing, lunch boxes, pork, instant noodles and crackers.</P>
      <P>Overall, the salary earners have spent an additional NT$5,378 per month to cope
with the latest wave of inflation.</P>
      <P>If gauged by a 1-10 misery index where 10 was the most miserable, the misery
index of salary earners currently stands at 7.93 points.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted between June 15 and July 5 with 1,488 effective
questionnaires collected. It had a margin of error of plus or minus 2.5

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of the Interior (MOI) finalized Monday the income criteria for a
housing subsidy program targeting young couples who do not own a home, which is
set to be launched next year.</P>
      <P>Under the program, the government would provide a subsidy of NT$3,600 (US$117)
per month for two years for those renting a home, or subsidize the full cost of
interest on up to NT$2 million in home loans for the first two years of
mortgages given to new homebuyers.</P>
      <P>According  to the income criteria set Monday by the MOI, applications for the
rental subsidy will be open to households whose annual incomes fall in the
bottom 60 percent of income earners in their places of residence.</P>
      <P>Estimated to fall within this range will be households earning no more than
NT$1.58 million per year in Taipei City, those earning no more than NT$1.14
million per year in Kaohsiung City, and those earning no more than NT$1.04
million per year in the rest of Taiwan, the ministry said.</P>
      <P>In terms of the government-subsidized home loan, households whose annual incomes
rank below the 80th percentile in disposable income will be eligible to apply.</P>
      <P>This will cover households earning no more than NT$2.18 million per year in
Taipei City, no more than NT$1.57 million per year in Kaohsiung City, and no
more than NT$1.4 million in the rest of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In considering the applications, the government will also take into account the
number of dependents the applicants are supporting, the MOI said.</P>
      <P>According to other details already unveiled by the ministry, during the first
year of the program, up to 20,000 households will receive the rental subsidy and
up to 10,000 can receive the government-subsidized home loan.</P>
      <P>In addition to meeting the income criteria, applicants for the rental subsidy
must be couples aged 20-40 who were married within two years of the application
date or who have children under 20 or adult children who are still studying.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the preferential home loan is for couples aged 20-40 who were married
within two years of the application date or those aged 20-45 who are upgrading
to a bigger home after having children.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Teco offers equipment to keep IC health cards flowing</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The supply of national health insurance IC cards will not be interrupted after
Teco Electric and Machinery Co. offered to make available the manufacturing
equipment needed to print the cards, the Bureau of National Health Insurance
said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>"In consideration  of the public interest,  Teco took the initiative in
informing us yesterday evening that it will provide IC card manufacturing
equipment for four months, " Chu Tzer-ming, the bureau's president and CEO, said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The arrangement ensures that the supply of IC cards, in which the medical
records of the holder are stored, will remain normal after the existing contract
with Teco to supply the cards expires Aug. 6.</P>
      <P>The bureau said Monday that renewing the contract with Teco would violate the
Public Officials' Conflicts of Interest Prevention Act, since Teco Chairman, C.
K. Liu, is Premier Liu Chao-shiuan's brother.</P>
      <P>It had originally anticipated having to issue about 800,000 temporary paper
cards over the six months needed to find a new vendor to people who needed new
cards, such as newborns and foreign spouses and workers.</P>
      <P>Chu said  that  late  Monday,  Teco offered  to make its card-processing
equipment available to the government to process the 500,000 blank IC cards
still in inventory from a two-year contract requiring Teco to provide 3.58
million IC cards.</P>
      <P>The bureau will purchase the 500,000 blank cards and prepare them as needed with
equipment provided by the company until the bureau finds a new supplier through
an open bidding process, Chu said, now expecting the process to be completed in
four months rather than the six months he estimated a day earlier.</P>
      <P>Asked if the 500,000 blank IC cards will be sufficient to meet demand during the
four-month period, Chu said "it should be", adding that paper cards were no
longer an option.</P>
      <P>Teco won the initial NT$3.8 billion contract to produce the cards in 2001,
issuing the first national health insurance IC card in 2002. Since then, the
contract has been renewed twice, in 2003 and 2006.</P>
      <P>Teco on Monday said it was considering challenging the bureau's decision by
applying for an interpretation of the Constitution so that the meaning of
"conflict of interest" would be better defined.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Wanan No. 31 air raid drill, originally scheduled to be held Tuesday night
and then later set for earlier the same day, has now been postponed to the
daytime of Aug. 28, the chief of staff of the Ministry of National Defense's
Armed Forces Reserve Command said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a news conference, Maj. Gen. Pi Hsueh-wen said the move was made in
consideration of public concerns about the holding of the air drill at night.</P>
      <P>The drill had been slated to be held in an area north of the counties of Hsinchu
and Yilan between 10: 30 p.m. and 11 p.m. on Tuesday, but the scheduling drew
criticism from many quarters, including Legislator Chai Trong-rong.</P>
      <P>Chai argued that holding the drill at night would have caused disruptions by
requiring homes, shops, commercial buildings and night markets in the area to
turn off all lights and suspend operations during the drill.</P>
      <P>In response, Premier Liu Chao-shiuan later issued orders for the drill to be
held on Aug. 5 during the daytime.</P>
      <P>At Tuesday's press conference, Pi said that a meeting was held Aug. 1 with
interior ministry officials and representatives of local governments in the
areas where the air drill is to be held.</P>
      <P>It was agreed at the meeting that the air drill should be rescheduled to a later
date, he said.</P>
      <P>The air raid drill will now be held between 2: 30 p.m. and 3 p.m. on Aug. 28, he
added.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the same news conference, Lt. Gen. Wang Hsing-wei, chief of staff of
the defense ministry's armed forces reserve department, said that the air raid
drill was rescheduled for the daytime because the media and public had not been
informed well enough in advance to avoid inconveniences.</P>
      <P>He said that the ministry has not ruled out the possibility of holding air raid
drills at night in the future if required and that adequate advance notice will
be given to the public.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Nearly a quarter of junior high school students and 41.5 percent of senior high
school students in Taipei City say they have experience of falling in love,
according to a survey compiled by the city's Department of Health.</P>
      <P>The survey recently conducted among students at 116 middle schools in the city
shows that falling in love is a common phenomenon among high school students in
the city, regardless of whether their parents are strict or permissive,
according to department official Kao Wei-chun.</P>
      <P>Junior high students struck by Cupid's arrow tended to have more permissive
parents, while senior high students who had fallen in love were more likely to
have strict parents, Kao noted.</P>
      <P>Among junior high respondents who had fallen in love, 70.22 percent said they
had been through a break-up, and among that group, 76.87 percent said they could
accept it.</P>
      <P>Just over 81 percent of senior high respondents who have been in love revealed
they had suffered a break-up, with 83.28 percent of them saying they could
accept it, the survey revealed.</P>
      <P>The survey showed that the ratio of students who had been in love rose with
their age and that the older the students were, the more accepting they were of
breaking up.</P>
      <P>In the survey, falling in love was defined as both sides admitting they were in
love with each other and that a third party knew about the relationship.</P>
      <P>On their feelings about falling in love, some 42 percent of junior high students
and 48 percent of senior high students who had been in relationships said
falling in love made them feel they were not lonely, as there was somebody to
keep them company, Kao said.</P>
      <P>That finding coincided with another of the survey's conclusions, which
discovered that a high proportion of students who had been in love had parents
who spent less than one hour per day keeping them company.</P>
      <P>The survey also suggested  that students who had been in relationships suffered
emotional disturbances more often than those without the experience, Kao added.</P>
      <P>In response to the survey, several education professionals said that it is now
common for boys and girls to date on school campuses, and argued that banning
dating would only have an adverse effect.</P>
      <P>They suggested  that schools strengthen  gender and health education to help
students to understand the differences between genders and instill in students
proper concepts on how to get along with the opposite sex.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan's de facto ambassador to U.S. assumes office</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Aug.  4 (CNA)
08/05/08  16:59:12
(By Jorge Liu and T.C. Jiang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's new representative to the United States Jason Yuan said upon arriving
in Washington, D.C. Monday that he expects the U.S. government will eventually
approve pending sales of defensive weapons to Taiwan and that he will restore
mutual trust between the two sides.</P>
      <P>Yuan received a warm welcome from 100 Taiwanese officials and expatriates upon
his arrival at a Washington, D.C. airport Monday.</P>
      <P>Barbara J. Schrage, managing director of the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT),
also showed up to welcome Yuan.</P>
      <P>Schrage said at the airport that the U.S. and Taiwan have long had a solid
relationship and that she hopes bilateral relations will become more solid in
the future.</P>
      <P>Yuan, Taiwan's de facto ambassador to the U.S., agreed but claimed that the
mutual trust between the U.S. and Taiwan has been undermined due to "human
factors" over the past few years.</P>
      <P>Yuan, who was sworn in on July 22 in Taipei, was referring to Taiwan's previous
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) administration, which governed Taiwan from
2000 to 2008.</P>
      <P>The  former  DPP  administration's  strong  advocacy  of a Taiwan-centric
identity led to friction with Washington during its term in office.</P>
      <P>Relations grew particularly strained in 2007 when the DPP pushed a referendum
asking local voters if they agreed to have Taiwan join the United Nations under
the name "Taiwan," which Washington saw as a proxy vote on independence and
provocative to China.</P>
      <P>The U.S. is Taiwan's most powerful ally despite an absence of formal diplomatic
ties.</P>
      <P>At the airport, Yuan said he will use his sincerity to rebuild mutual trust.</P>
      <P>As bilateral relations are solid, he said he believes that rebuilding trust will
not be too difficult but will take time.</P>
      <P>Asked about Washington's apparent freeze on weapons sales to Taiwan in recent
years, Yuan noted that U.S. government agencies -- including the Department of
State, the Department of Defense and the National Security Council -- have never
used the word "freeze."</P>
      <P>He said the U.S. is a country that follows the law and that the Taiwan Relations
Act is "a U.S. law."</P>
      <P>Under the Taiwan Relations Act, the U.S. must ensure Taiwan's security and
supply necessary defensive weapons to Taiwan, he said.</P>
      <P>As a result, he said he does not believe that any U.S. government official would
violate the act and freeze arms deals with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The U.S. passed the Taiwan Relations Act in 1979 when it switched recognition to
China.</P>
      <P>Noting that the U.S. Congress is now in recess, Yuan said he believes that after
Congress reconvenes, the U.S. government would notify Congress of its approval
of the sale of an arms package to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He said he also believes that Congress would not object to the approval.</P>
      <P>Congress will adjourn on Sept. 26, meaning the notification, which Congress has
30 days to respond to, would have to be submitted later this month for the arms
deal to be finalized this year.</P>
      <P>Asked about a specific time frame, Yuan responded that even if the arms package
were to pass today, it would take years before Taiwan received the weapons.</P>
      <P>The focus, he said, should be on whether the U.S. is willing to provide weapons
and whether Taiwan is willing to buy them, and at this time, neither presents a
problem, Yuan believed.</P>
      <P>Asked if Taiwan worries that a new government in the U.S. next year will change

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou will make two stopovers in the United States during his
upcoming visit to Taiwan's diplomatic allies in South America and the Caribbean
later this month, diplomatic sources said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The state visit will be Ma's first since he took office in May.</P>
      <P>Ma will make low-profile U.S. stopovers and therefore will not meet Taiwanese
expatriates or U.S. officials, lawmakers and scholars, the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs sources said.</P>
      <P>Ma's low-key efforts are aimed at repairing relations between the two sides,
which critics said were strained by former President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>Chen, who favored pushing a Taiwan-centric identity and asserting Taiwan's de
facto sovereignty while he was in power from 2000 to 2008, was accused of using
transit stopovers in the U.S. to strengthen his political support at home.</P>
      <P>Ma has vowed not to follow his predecessor to capitalize on the state visit for
political purposes.</P>
      <P>The president will lead a delegation to attend presidential inaugurations in
Paraguay and the Dominican Republic, two of the 23 countries that recognize
Taiwan diplomatically, the sources noted.</P>
      <P>He will depart Taipei on Aug. 12 on a China Airlines flight and make an
overnight transit in Los Angeles, the sources said.</P>
      <P>He will take a charter flight on Aug. 13 from Los Angeles to Paraguay, during
which his plane will stop over in Panama to refuel, the sources said.</P>
      <P>During his brief stay in Panama, Ma will meet his Panamanian counterpart,
Martin Torrijos,  to exchange views on bilateral relations, the sources said.</P>
      <P>On Aug. 15, Ma will attend Paraguayan President-elect Fernando Lugo's
inauguration ceremony and head to the Dominican Republic later that day, the
sources added.</P>
      <P>Ma will take part in the inauguration of Dominican Republic President Leonel
Fernandez, who was re-elected to a third term, on Aug. 16, the sources said.</P>
      <P>Ma plans to board a charter flight to stop over in San Francisco the next day,
the sources disclosed, adding that Ma's plane will stop in Austin, Texas, to
refuel for one hour en route to San Francisco.</P>
      <P>He will take a brief rest at a local hotel before flying home on another China
Airlines flight, the sources said.</P>
      <P>Ma is slated to arrive in Taiwan on Aug. 19.</P>

      <P>Vice President Vincent Siew and Premier Liu Chao-shiuan attended a ceremony at
Taichung County's Central Taiwan Science Park Tuesday to mark the fifth

      <P>Siew and Liu hailed the park's achievements, praising it as the leading engine
of high-tech development in central Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Siew attributed the park's success to its competitive strength, which is
integrating advanced technology and traditional businesses.</P>
      <P>"The Central Taiwan Science Park has set several records on several different
fronts in terms of its rapid development, " Siew said.</P>
      <P>The Central Taiwan Science Park has developed into a cluster of businesses
focused on the optoelectronic and precision machinery sectors.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou's 86-year-old mother's vital signs are now stable,
following her hospitalization Sunday for impaired blood flow to the brain, a
Taipei hospital official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chin Hou-hsiu was hospitalized at Taipei's Wan Fang Hospital for vertigo caused
by cerebral ischemia, said the hospital's deputy superintendent Hsu Chun-sen.
Cerebral ischemia is a condition in which the brain doesn't receive enough blood
to maintain normal functioning.</P>
      <P>Various factors, such as high blood pressure and abnormal contraction of blood
vessels, contribute to cerebral ischemia, Hsu said. But Hsu said that an
examination of Chin's blood pressure and other indicators by a special medical
team found her to be in stable condition.</P>
      <P>The hospital suggested to the president's family that Chin remain in the
hospital for a week to ensure that she recovers well. That means Chin will be
discharged from the hospital on Aug. 11 at the earliest.</P>
      <P>Ma visited his mother in the hospital on Monday and Tuesday, Hsu said.</P>
      <P>Presidential Office Spokesman Wang Yu-chi thanked the public for their concerns

      <P>The government's energy saving and carbon reduction plans for next year will
need a budget of more than NT$100 billion (US$3.25 billion) , an official of the

      <P>The package covers projects proposed by different government departments in line
with the guidelines on the country's energy policy developed by the Executive
Yuan in June, the official said.</P>
      <P>The guidelines emphasized strengthening research and development of energy
conservation, developing carbon-free renewable energy, and looking at nuclear
power as an option for carbon-free energy, according to the official.</P>
      <P>Increasing energy efficiency, phasing out old electricity power plants, and
promoting green industry and green architecture were all highlighted in the
guidelines, the official said.</P>
      <P>The government's energy policy aims to reduce the annual level of carbon dioxide
emissions in Taiwan to 2008 levels by 2020, and to 2000 levels by 2025, the
official said.</P>
      <P>The official said the projects in the budget package covered a range of
proposals, such as promoting cycling as an alternative means of transportation,
dispensing with the use of paper in offices, and planting forests.</P>
      <P>The CEPD, which is responsible for drafting overall plans for national economic
development, evaluating development projects and coordinating the economic
policymaking activities of ministries and agencies, will submit the projects to

      <P>The Coast Guard Administration said Tuesday that it saved more than NT$8.79
million (US$286,000) on energy use over the first six months of this year by
following the Executive Yuan's energy conservation, carbon reduction and
sustainable energy programs.</P>
      <P>The savings came in the form of reduced water, electricity, diesel, gasoline and
paper use, according to the Coast Guard.</P>
      <P>Following the example set by its chief Wang Chin-wang, all of the Coast Guard's
offices and patrol units around the country have been working in line with the
energy conservation programs.</P>
      <P>According to the Coast Guard's tallies, the coast guard's gasoline use for
January-June was down by more than 167,400 liters over the same period a year
earlier. However, due to rising fuel prices, the Coast Guard actually spent
NT$118,000 more on gas year-on-year.</P>
      <P>The Coast Guard's greatest success was in the reduction of diesel use, with the
amount consumed for the first six months of this year dropping 1.38 million
liters over the same period last year, for a savings of NT$5.41 million.</P>
      <P>Second on the list was electricity use, which was down by over 662,000 kilowatt-
hours, translating into savings of NT$2.41 million, followed by paper use, down
by over 24,000 kilograms for NT$616,000 in savings, and water use, which the
coast guard reduced by more than 100,000 cubic meters for savings of NT$470,000,

      <P>The National Police Agency (NPA) sponsored a seminar Tuesday to help police
officers from cities and counties across Taiwan to better detect fake Chinese
currency.</P>
      <P>Fake yuan have become increasingly common since June 30, when Taiwan allowed
convertibility between local New Taiwan dollars and the Chinese yuan at 1,500
branches of 13 local banks. The government timed the measure ahead of the
arrival of greater numbers of Chinese tourists in early July.</P>
      <P>At the seminar, experts displayed bogus Chinese yuan that had been seized in
raids, to give police a better idea of what to look for.</P>
      <P>"Once police officers become familiar with the methods for telling fake bills
from real ones, they can also teach the public how to avoid counterfeit Chinese
yuan bills," NPA officers said.</P>
      <P>Police said that three features on Chinese yuan are hard to fake: a watermark of
the Chinese characters of the bill's denomination in the center of the bill, a
security thread similar to that on Taiwan's paper money, and features that
appear to change color when observed from different angles.</P>
      <P>Since the beginning of this year, police nationwide have seized 713 fake yuan
bills in seven cases, the officers noted.</P>
      <P>The counterfeit bills that police seized were made with advanced techniques,
making them difficult for the general public to detect, they said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>An opposition lawmaker argued Tuesday that the low number of Chinese tourist
arrivals over the past month indicated a lack of success of President Ma Ying-
jeou's efforts to attract Chinese tourists to boost the country's economy.</P>
      <P>According to Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Legislator Gao Jyh-peng, Taiwan
must curb its economic reliance on China because "China is insincere toward
Taiwan" and "is still controlling the number of Chinese citizens allowed to
visit Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Gao noted that over the past month, since the first group of ordinary Chinese
tourists arrived on July 4, only 5,664 China citizens have visited Taiwan for
pleasure.</P>
      <P>That number translates into an average 183 Chinese tourists per day, which is
only 6.1 percent of the target number of 3,000 tourists per day set by Ma, Gao
said.</P>
      <P>Even if one counted only the 18 days from July 18 when Chinese tourists were
officially allowed admission, the average daily arrivals still amount to only
299, he said.</P>
      <P>While Ma claimed consumption in Taiwan spurred by the entry of 3,000 Chinese
tourists daily would amount to more than NT$164 million (US$5.36 million) per
day, or NT$60 billion per year, the actual consumption over the past month was
estimated at only NT$9,862 per day, Gao said.</P>
      <P>Though unsuccessful, the Kuomintang administration's policy to woo Chinese
tourists has seriously affected the desire of Japanese tourists to visit Taiwan,
the lawmaker said.</P>
      <P>In June alone, Japanese tourist arrivals totaled only 86,022, down 6.63 percent
from the same month last year, Gao pointed out. With each Japanese tourist
spending US$264 per day in Taiwan on average, the decrease meant a loss of
US$1.5 million in tourism income in June, he said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan had opened its doors to group tours by certain categories of Chinese
citizens since 2002, but ordinary Chinese citizens were only officially allowed
to make sightseeing visits to the island from July 18, 2008, under an agreement
signed between Taiwan and China in Beijing in June.</P>

      <P>A German couple was awarded Alishan tea artist certificates after passing an
examination on knowledge of tea and the tea-brewing process held by the Meishan

      <P>Dressed in traditional Chinese Tang-style garments, the Germans Andy Yang and
Yang Hung-feng, who were among the 10 examinees taking the test, drew a lot of
attention from local residents.</P>
      <P>Yang Hung-feng, who is of Chinese ethnicity, and her German husband Andy Yang
are both fond of tea and are dedicated to the study of tea culture. They said
they traveled to Taiwan specifically to take the exam after they learned that it
was being held by the Meishan office.</P>
      <P>The couple runs a tea house in Germany and has organized many training courses
in tea culture for tea lovers there.</P>
      <P>The exam included three categories -- subject tests,  the identification of tea
leaves, and the art of tea-brewing. Examinees are required to score more than 75
percent in order to obtain a certificate.</P>
      <P>According to Huang Shi-yu, chief of Meishan township, despite its famous quality
high mountain tea and advanced tea-drying technology, the township had long
neglected the importance of promoting tea arts and tea lore.</P>
      <P>However, the office began last October to offer the tea-brewing examination and

      <P>Over the past two years, the Cabinet has approved the second- and third-stage
projects of the Central Taiwan Science Park, as the park's 413-hectare main base
in Taichung can no longer meet the needs of high-tech industries.</P>
      <P>The second-stage project will entail the development of a 97-hectare  area in
Yunlin County's  Huwei township,  while a 246-hectare tract in Houli township of
Taichung County has been chosen for the third-stage development plan.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet is now considering finding another tract of land for the fourth
stage.</P>
      <P>Attending the anniversary celebration, Changhua Magistrate Cho Po-yuan told the
vice president and the premier that his county is ready to be a part of the
science park by providing the land for the fourth-stage project.</P>
      <P>"Taichung City, Taichung County and Yunlin County all have a finger in the pie,
and it would unfair to skip Changhua County," said Cho.</P>
      <P>Another guest, Lee Ying-yuan, deputy magistrate of Yunlin County -- the only
county in central Taiwan controlled by the opposition Democratic Progressive
Party -- said the Cabinet should make the decision based on the park's needs
rather than by considering a candidate county's political connections.</P>
      <P>Lee said Yunlin County is also ready to provide the land and that its close
proximity to the Sixth Naphtha Cracking Plant would be an added advantage.</P>
      <P>In his congratulatory remarks, the vice president set forth a plan to build a
high-technology  corridor  in western Taiwan, incorporating Taichung City,
Taichung County, Yunlin County and Changhua County. This immediately prompted
speculation that Changhua County might have been selected as the site for the
fourth-stage development plan.</P>
      <P>However, Lee Lou-Chuang, head of the Cabinet-level National Science Council,
said the fourth-stage plan has not been finalized and that the Cabinet has not
yet made a decision on the location of the project.</P>
      <P>The Central Taiwan Science Park at present hosts more than 90 high-tech firms,
with total business turnover expected to reach NT$360 billion (US$11.7 billion)
in 2008.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Financial and insurance workers experience highest fatigue level: CLA</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Employees in the financial and insurance sector ranked at the top of a survey on
work fatigue conducted by the Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) , according to the
results released Tuesday.</P>
      <P>They were followed by workers in the real estate business, and those in the
fields of medical care and social work, the survey showed.</P>
      <P>The survey conducted last September asked the respondents whether their work
left them emotionally drained, made them feel frustrated, physically exhausted,
depleted at the thought of another work day, and whether they found it hard to
get through every minute at the work place?</P>
      <P>For each of the five questions, there were five possible answers -- always,
often, sometimes, seldom, and never. The score for each answer was 100, 75, 50,
25, and 0, respectively, with the higher score representing the higher level of
fatigue.</P>
      <P>Those workers who receive a combined score of 40 points and above were
considered at the highest fatigue level. The average score of workers in the
financial and insurance sector was 35.5 points, followed by those in real estate
(35.2 points), and in the medical field and social work (29.9 points).</P>
      <P>The fatigue level of employers and the self-employed  was generally lower than
that of employees,  with workers in the transportation and warehousing sector
recording an average 28.7 points, those in the accommodation and eatery business
26.2 points and those in the manufacturing sector 25.8 points.</P>
      <P>In terms of gender, the fatigue level of female workers was higher, at 29.2
points, than that of the male workers, at 27.2 points.</P>
      <P>The survey also found that for those employees who said they were tired at work,
their level of dissatisfaction and feeling of unwellness was also higher.</P>
      <P>The factors  that usually  contribute  to fatigue  include psychological
problems, injustice and lack of safety in work place and low levels of
participation in the decision-making process.</P>
      <P>The survey on fatigue levels was conducted last September on a sampling of
19,000 employees and 5,000 employers and self-employed people, with 24,996
effective questionnaires, or 88 percent of the distributed questionnaires
returned.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>One month after the launch of direct weekend cross-Taiwan Strait charter
flights, the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) said Tuesday that the number
of passengers has been increasing week by week, and that the most popular air
route is Taoyuan-Shanghai.</P>
      <P>According to CAA Director General Lee Long-wen, during the first month of
operation, the average passenger occupancy rate on the flights climbed from 83
percent on the weekend of July 4 to 89 percent on the fourth weekend of the
month.</P>
      <P>Some 52,000 passengers traveled on the charter flights in July, he said.</P>
      <P>Among all the air routes, the Taoyuan International Airport to Shanghai route
was most in demand, showing an average passenger occupancy rate of 93 percent,
followed by the route Songshan airport in Taipei to Shanghai, China, with an
occupancy rate of 87 percent, Lee said.</P>
      <P>The average passenger occupancy rate in general was 87 percent, Lee said, adding
that some airlines have already switched to larger aircraft to provide more
seats.</P>
      <P>"As the high occupancy rate means that demand is strong, it is possible that new
negotiations on destinations and the number of flights will be held after the
Beijing Olympic Games, " said Lee at a press conference.</P>
      <P>He further indicated that during the period July 4 to Aug. 3, 5,381 Chinese
tourists traveled to Taiwan on the weekend direct charter flights, implying that
most of the passengers taking the flights are Taiwanese nationals.</P>
      <P>Under an agreement signed June 13 by Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation and
its Chinese counterpart, the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Straits, Taiwan opened its doors to larger numbers of tourists from China, and
weekend direct charter flights between the two sides were launched July 4.</P>
      <P>In the initial stage of the opening, the daily ceiling on the entry of Chinese
tourists was capped at 3,000, allowing for a total of 1.1 million Chinese
visitors per year. In four years, the ceiling is expected to be raised to 10,000

    <HEADLINE>AmCham pleased to see eased economic restrictions</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The newly inaugurated president of the Taipei-based American Chamber of Commerce
(AmCham) applauded Tuesday the general direction of the government's economic
policies, saying that the government should have as few restrictions on business
as possible.</P>
      <P>Andrea Wu made the remarks in her first media gathering after she took office
July 1.</P>
      <P>"We are pleased to see the general direction in which the new government is
heading, even though details of the de-regulation measures have yet to be
finalized," Wu said.</P>
      <P>She said AmCham believes that it is better for businesses if the government
intervenes less and lets the market mechanism take the lead.</P>
      <P>"In the international economy, the more restrictions there are, the more harmful
it is to business," Wu contended.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou's administration, which took office May 20, relaxed a
number of economic policies, including making the decision to allow
semiconductor firms to set up advanced 12-inch wafer factories in China and
increasing the cap on China-bound investment to 60 percent of a firm's net
worth, from 40 percent or less under the previous administration of former
President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>Asked about Taiwan's poor economic performance, she described it as a reflection
of a global financial downturn rather than a result of wrong economic policies
by the new government.</P>
      <P>"It is too early to make judgment, as the government has been in office for a
little more than 60 days, " Wu said. "Especially when most of the strong
economic bodies in the world are suffering, it is very hard for Taiwan to
perform differently."</P>
      <P>Speaking of AmCham's annual "doorknock" trip to Washington, D.C. in June, Wu
said that compared to the rather "challenging" trips made over the past few
years, the atmosphere this year was very positive.</P>
      <P>She said that in terms of Taiwan-U.S. economic relations, the encouraging
atmosphere presents a window of opportunity for the government to work with the
Bush administration.</P>
      <P>Wu noted that there are several important things the government should address
immediately to enhance economic relations between Taipei and Washington,
including a Bilateral Investment Agreement (BIA) , a Government Procurement
Agreement (GPA) and a Trade and Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA).</P>
      <P>She said a GPA, BIA and TIFA can serve as building blocks toward a Free Trade
Agreement (FTA) , which is something Taiwan is keen to sign.</P>
      <P>Another message that the doorknock team brought back to Taipei was the
suggestion that Taiwan should try to find more budget to help fund fellowships,
scholarly exchanges, research grants and other programs for young U.S. academics
engaged in Asian studies.</P>
      <P>The goal for that, Wu said, would be to ensure over the long term that more
American experts on the Asian region have some familiarity with Taiwan and
concern about its future.</P>
      <P>Prior to her AmCham appointment, Taiwan-born Wu was general manager of United
Airlines, and she also served as AmCham vice chairwoman for two years before
becoming the chamber's first female chair in 2004.</P>
      <P>Established in 1951, AmCham, which consists of more than 950 individuals
representing more than 500 companies, is the oldest, largest and most active
foreign business organization in Taiwan.</P>

      <P>Two high quality, Taiwan-grown organic teas were among 12 recognized by Beijing
Olympics organizers as "Olympic First Teas, " the Association of Taiwan Tea said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The two winners from Taiwan were the premium "Yipaohong" black tea and
"Yipaolong" oolong produced by the Fofashan Organic Ecology Tea Farm in
Taichung, central Taiwan.</P>
      <P>They defeated several thousand Chinese and Taiwanese farms in a "battle of the
teas, " winning the right to be displayed and served along with 10 other teas at
the Beijing International Media Center during the Olympics.</P>
      <P>"It is an honor to have the chance to join the 'cultural' dimension of the
Games, " said Buddhist monk Shang Lun, the founder of the Fofashan Temple that
operates the organic tea farm.</P>
      <P>Olympics organizers are displaying tea, porcelain and silk in Beijing as three
core elements of Chinese culture.</P>
      <P>Master Shang Lun built the Fofashan tea farm in Dakeng of the Taichung county 15
years ago to grow tea through natural cultivation -- that is, without using
chemical fertilizers or herbicides.</P>
      <P>Association of Taiwan Tea Secretary Liang Ming-chan touted the farm's organic
tea as "Buddhist tea that is injected with the Zen spirit in its planting,
production and consumption." Taiwan's teas were the only organic teas selected
to be "Olympic First Teas."</P>
      <P>The  honor  recognizes  Taiwan's  efforts  to  promote environmentally-friendly
"green agriculture," Liang noted.</P>
      <P>In July, Fofashan's Yipaolong tea won the top prize in the oolong category of a
national organic tea competition co-sponsored by the Taichung-based association
and the Agricultural and Food Agency. The Yipaohong was the top prize-winner in
the black tea category in the 2007 competition.</P>
      <P>Liang said that Beijing Olympics organizers screened popular tea products from
around China and Taiwan, inviting more than 100 Taiwanese tea producers to enter
their best teas in the contest.</P>
      <P>Teas were selected in six categories: oolong tea, black tea, green tea, white
tea, yellow tea, and dark tea.</P>

      <P>Taipei City animal health officials urged citizens Tuesday to seize the
opportunity to have their cats and dogs neutered quickly to take advantage of a
subsidy program that is already 60 percent complete.</P>
      <P>According to the officials from the Taipei Municipal Institute for Animal
Health, the city government had spent NT$2.546 million, or 67 percent its total
annual budget, as of the end of July on the animal sterilization program that
was launched at the end of last year.</P>
      <P>The figure means that a total of 1,996 animals -- 1,354 female cats and dogs and
640 males -- have been neutered under the municipal subsidy program, the
officials noted.</P>
      <P>As some NT$1.64 million of the budget remains intact, municipal health officials
encouraged Taipei citizens who have not yet done so to take their pets to get
neutered.</P>
      <P>Stray animals are a serious problem in Taiwan, particularly in Taipei City,
where only 36 percent of the strays are sterilized -- well below the average 70
percent level in the United States, according to the institute.</P>
      <P>As a result of the limited number of shelters available to hold stray cats,
animal protection groups have aggressively encouraged adoption. They have also
urged the government to increase its budget for animal contraception and its
trap, neuter, release project, while reducing the amount spent on slaughtering
unwanted animals.</P>

      <P>Taiwan will have a fruitful year and shine in the international architecture
industry as it is showcasing two of the  country's  outstanding  architectural
works  at the 11th International Architecture Exhibition in Venice in September,
Council for Cultural Affairs (CCA) Minister Huang Pi-twan said at a news
conference Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The 11th Architecture Biennale -- La Biennale di Venezia -- will take place in
Venice from Sept. 14-Nov. 23 with the theme of "Out There:  Architecture  Beyond
Building,  " which emphasizes the experimental aspects of "work using means,
venues, images and forms that come before, go beyond, do without or supersede
autonomous buildings."</P>
      <P>In addition to a project titled "Dark City, " which was chosen by the CCA to
represent Taiwan at the world-renowned exhibition, "Somewhere Out There," a work
created by a group called Interbreeding Field -- a team from Tainan National
University of the Arts -- received an unprecedented  invitation from the
biennale to be presented in the central building at the Padiglione Italia along
with various Italian projects.</P>
      <P>"With this invitation from the biennale, Interbreeding Field has written a new
page on the art of Taiwan's architecture, said Huang. "We believe that the two
projects demonstrate the strength of Taiwan's architecture talent and will bring
a Taiwanese flavor to the biennale," he added.</P>
      <P>Lu Li-hung,  director of Interbreeding Field and associate professor of the
Tainan National University of the Arts, said the team is honored to be invited
and is anxious to demonstrate its work to the world.</P>
      <P>"We will do our best to showcase Taiwan's creative strength, " Lu said,  adding
that "I hope  our work  can win international recognition."</P>
      <P>Featuring several large installations of LED bulbs in hundreds of white plastic
containers, Lu said the work aims to create a relationship between the spectator
and the environment.</P>
      <P>"The  project  examines  the possibilities  of experimental constructions in the
fields of joy, life meditation, indulgence, trance and tranquility in order to
create an interaction between the spectator and the object within the emotional
memory and atmosphere of the overall construction of the space," he said.</P>
      <P>Using video footage and graphic collages, Kuo Chao-lee, director of the "Dark
City" project, said the work proposes the concept of "meaning installation" and
that its objective is to disclose the undercurrent energy and the secretive
affairs of the city at night, as well as to challenge the legitimacy of the
popular practice of "designing for the day."</P>
      <P>"It returns space to a `primordial' state before building, " he said. "It is a
space of body, a space of tectonics and illusion. It is also a local
representation of the dark urbanism of Taiwan, allowing the visitor to converse
with it directly with bodily senses and letting meanings be nomads roaming from
one world to another," he added.</P>

      <P>Taiwanese wives often advise their better halves to get more exercise to keep
their energy levels up, according to the results of a survey released Tuesday by
the Taiwanese Association of Andrology.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted among women aged 18-40 by National Chengchi University
and was commissioned by the association.</P>
      <P>The results show that over half of the respondents described President Ma Ying-
jeou as representative of "Taiwan's energetic man."</P>
      <P>Ma, an avid jogger and swimmer, maintains a regular exercise regime.</P>
      <P>Among the country's other high-ranking political figures, former Premier Frank
Hsieh was also rated as an energetic man by 10 percent of the respondents.</P>
      <P>Among the nation's city and county chiefs, 4.5 percent of those polled described
Taichung Mayor Jason Hu as the most energetic local chief, ahead of Taipei Mayor
Hau Lung-bin and Taoyuan Magistrate Eric Liluan Chu.</P>
      <P>Asked how they try to make their partners more energetic, 90 percent of those
surveyed said they ask their men to "exercise more," while 4.5 percent said they
feed them tonics.</P>
      <P>In terms of locality, women in Taichung City have most confidence in tonics,
followed by women in Taipei City and Kaohsiung City.</P>
      <P>Wang Chi-chieh, president of the association and director of the Department of
Urology at Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital, said that "more exercise is
the right approach" and expressed reservations about the efficacy of taking
tonics or eating seafood, saying that random tonics can actually pose a health
hazard, especially as most people get enough nutrition from their regular diet,
so that more tonics simply place an added burden on the body.</P>
      <P>Wang also said that when men experience symptoms of low energy and endurance, as
well as erectile difficulty or dysfunction, they should not take tonics but
should seek professional advice from doctors.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan firms' credit outlook seen as stable despite emerging risks</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug.5 (CNA)
08/05/08  21:49:55

    <TEXT>
      <P>The credit outlook for Taiwan's top 100 corporations was largely stable in 2007,
although they faced higher risks due to the weakened economic environment around
the globe, a local credit rating company said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Rating Corporation (TRC) announced its latest credit evaluations of
Taiwan's top 100 enterprises, selected on the basis of sales revenue, and
indicated that credit quality generally remained stable among the top-tier
corporations in 2007.</P>
      <P>Credit ratings, usually assigned to straight bonds, convertibles, subordinated
debt and syndicated loans, can be used as a tool for investor relations,
transparency and disclosure with the aim to facilitate creditors as well as
investors to check the financial health of a company.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan's corporations have done fairly well throughout the economic cycles
because of their cost competitiveness, " Daisuke Fukutomi, TRC's vice president
and chief ratings officer said at a press meeting Tuesday.</P>
      <P>According TRC, 40 percent of the top companies showed strong credit quality,
while another 40 percent had moderate credit quality, and the other 20 percent
were ranked as weak.</P>
      <P>Daisuke added that conservative financial leverage could also help Taiwanese
companies to get through a possible recession, admitting that the global
economic downturn and widespread inflation had increased credit risks in the
performance of local enterprises.</P>
      <P>The other analysts at the press meeting agreed that while Taiwan enterprises
still have an edge among their Asia-Pacific competitors, capital liquidity will
be a vital factor in weathering the economic slowdown.</P>
      <P>Daniel Hsiao, TRC's director of corporate &amp; funds ratings, said that the
export-driven operation model of Taiwan's enterprises was at some level hurt by
the shrinking U.S. and EU markets.</P>
      <P>"Companies would need more capital liquidity and better operation management to
sustain their credit standards," Hsiao said.</P>
      <P>Another analyst, Frank Fan, TRC's associate director of corporate &amp; funds
ratings,  said Taiwan industries  have unique  global advantages.</P>
      <P>Improved cross-Taiwan Strait economic ties, led by financial deregulation, would
specifically give Taiwan's enterprises more room to operate, Fan said, adding
that the potential benefit would be long-term.</P>
      <P>He was referring to the relaxation of financial regulations proposed by the
Kuomintang government since it took office earlier this year. The administration
has said that it intends to implement 66 categories of deregulations, including
20 related to cross-strait affairs, by the end of this year.</P>
      <P>Asked if Taiwan's enterprises generally represent a better investment target
compared to Asia's three other little dragons -- Singapore, Hong Kong and South
Korea -- Hsiao said Taiwan's industry sector, especially its hi-tech industries,
stand out because of superb cost management.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, Foxconn, Chunghwa Telecom and AU
Optronics ranked as the top four Taiwanese companies in the terms of cash flow
and liquid financial assets, which reached NT$174.8 billion, NT$145.8 billion,
NT$95.2 billion, and NT$91.2 billion, respectively in 2007, according to TRC.</P>
      <P>"A healthy cost structure is normally the competitive edge that Taiwanese
companies have in competing with global players, " Hsiao said.</P>

      <P>AthenaWeb, the world's leading Internet audiovisual communication platform for
scientific information, will feature a series of short science films made by
students of National Chengchi University (NCCU) in Taipei, the European Economic
and Trade Office in Taiwan said in the latest issue of its monthly EU
Newsletter.</P>
      <P>The films, to be presented from August, will be "the first student-produced
programs ever to be posted on AthenaWeb," the July newsletter said, adding that
this new development will be followed by the launch of an international
competition for Internet films by science students later this year.</P>
      <P>The films by NCCU students are works from the Science Talent Training Program of
the Cabinet-level National Science Council, which has encouraged science
students to form teams, create scripts and shoot their own films in an attempt
to allow the students to bring their skills into full play.</P>
      <P>"Every one of the short movies created by the NCCU displays the students' deep
understanding of their selected scientific subjects and their excellent teamwork
in a most playful and entertaining manner," according to the newsletter.</P>
      <P>AnthenaWeb, launched in 2005, is supported by the European Commission's
Research  Directorate-General  and is run by the Brussels-based media agency Lab
to Media.</P>

      <P>An alien bird species popular among local bird-fanciers, the white-rumped shama
thrush (copsychus malabaricus), has invaded many low-altitude forest areas
around Taiwan, posing a great threat to the survival of native species, the
state-operated Endemic Species Research Institute warned Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The bird is a small passerine that originates in South Asia and is found from
India to southwestern China and Malaysia. With a beautiful voice and the ability
to mimic the sounds of other birds, it was introduced to Taiwan by bird-fanciers
and was a popular cage bird until the global outbreak of avian influenza in
2003.</P>
      <P>Institute researchers said they have been found to be increasing in number in
the wild in Taiwan over the past few years after being either accidentally or
deliberately released.</P>
      <P>With the ability to adapt themselves quickly to new environments, the bird has
succeeded in colonizing Taiwan and now breeds in great numbers, the researchers
said.</P>
      <P>In field observations, the researchers said they have found that shama thrush
feeds on many different kinds of arthropods, earthworms, frogs and lizards,
posing a threat to these species as well as to local bird species with which
they compete for food.</P>

    <HEADLINE>July CPI the highest since October 1994: DGBAS</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Led by a 13.61 percent hike in food prices, Taiwan's consumer price index (CPI)
rose 5.92 percent year-on-year in July to 106.88, the highest since October
1994, the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>In its monthly CPI report, the DGBAS indicated that the country's inflation
rate, core CPI, and wholesale price index (WPI) had all hit the highest levels
in recent years, mainly due to two storms and rising domestic fuel and
electricity prices.</P>
      <P>"The CPI increase in July was the highest since October 1994," said Chao-Ming
Wu, a DGBAS section chief, at a news conference Tuesday. He noted that the
inflation rate in September 1994 was 6.69 percent.</P>
      <P>Wu said the 13.61 percent hike in food prices represented the largest rise of
any category in the index's basket of goods, as the prices of cooking oil,
fruits, and meats rose by 42.02 percent, 25.52 percent and 24.76 percent year-
on-year, respectively.</P>
      <P>"Food prices in July were responsible, for the most part, for the inflation, and
represented 3.48 percent of the overall index," he said.</P>
      <P>Wu hinted at the possibility that food prices might fall in the coming months,
as international grain prices have dropped by nearly 40 percent in the last half
year.</P>
      <P>Domestic transportation costs also increased considerably, with the
transportation index rising 6.80 percent year-on-year, representing 0.97 percent
of the overall CPI growth rate, according to the report.</P>
      <P>"This increase has to do with gasoline prices, which were hiked by 1.5 percent
in the beginning of July," Wu said, adding that generally fuel prices rose by
23.26 percent, the biggest jump in the transportation category.</P>
      <P>The core CPI, which excludes the prices of energy, fresh vegetables,  fruit,
and seafood,  also rose by 4.06  percent year-on-year, the highest since March
1996.</P>
      <P>When asked if the annual inflation rate is likely to increase, Wu declined to
speculate on the possibility, saying the bureau will need to further evaluate
the situation before adjusting its forecast of 3.29 percent made in May.</P>
      <P>The growth rate of consumer prices was 4.18 percent for the period January to
July this year, leaving a slim possibility for the annual index to drop to the
level of the DGBAS May forecast.</P>
      <P>Wu said that because of the two typhoons that caused severe damage to the
island's agriculture sector in July, the CPI had peaked in summer. He said that
the growth rate could decline in September and October.</P>
      <P>Inflationary pressure could be seen in the WPI for imported commodities, which
rose by 11.49 percent year-on-year, he said.</P>
      <P>"Excluding the impact of the Taiwan dollar's appreciation, the WPI for imported
commodities, valued in U.S. dollars, soared by 26.50 percent in June, the
highest since March 1980," Wu said. The the index rose 26.90 percent in February
1980 because of the second oil crisis, he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan succeeds in propagation of rare salmon species</HEADLINE>

      <P>Much to the excitement of local researchers, artificially raised Formosan
landlocked salmon -- a critically endangered species -- have been successfully
breeding since being introduced into new habitats in the wild, an ichthyologist
announced Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Researchers  from  the Wuling  Formosan  Landlocked  Salmon Conservation Center
in the Sheipa National Park in central Taiwan have released about 1,000 of the
artificially bred rare salmon into the park's Sihjielan and Nanhu rivers over
the past two years.</P>
      <P>According to Liao Lin-yen,  the center's director,  a new generation of Formosan
landlocked salmon, numbering about 80 to 90, were seen swimming in the Sihjielan
river in June.</P>
      <P>"It marks the first time that the rare fish species -- a holdover from the last
Ice Age -- has survived and reproduced in a new habitat," Liao said.</P>
      <P>In the past, the fish could only be found in the Cijiawan river, a protected
sanctuary for the Formosan landlocked salmon in the Sheipa National Park.</P>
      <P>In the Nanhu river, Liao went on, only previously released salmon bearing
identification tags have been seen so far, meaning that they have not yet
spawned.</P>
      <P>The migration propagation of the rare fish, however, has drawn mixed reactions,
with opponents saying that the species should not be propagated in a location
where the fish has not previously been documented in history, while proponents
say migration propagation is vital to preserve the salmon, which faces the
threat of extinction.</P>
      <P>Liao said the conservation center remains neutral toward the issue and is more
concerned about conservation of the center's water supply.</P>
      <P>"As the water in the Cijiawn river tends to be very turbid following typhoons,
the conservation center needs to store water in advance to ensure that fry being
raised at the center can survive, " Liao said.</P>
      <P>Although  the environmental  devastation  caused by rampant overcultivation of
orchards and vegetable farms in the nearby Wuling Farm area has been brought
under control, landslides in the upper reaches of the river continue to occur,
causing serious turbidity downstream in the wake of typhoons or heavy rain, Liao
said.</P>
      <P>Without a large storage pond,  the water supply is often insufficient, Liao
said, adding that the center is considering drilling wells as a second water
supply source.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Liao said although the national park administration has built a
special structure in which the rare fish can take refuge in emergencies, the
number still suffers a steep decline after every typhoon or rainstorm.</P>
      <P>"Salmon numbers in the Cijiawan river have declined by about 25 percent to some
1,500 animals at the moment, due to the effects of Tropical Storm Kamaelgi and
Typhoon Fung Wong that swept across Taiwan in the past few weeks," he noted.</P>
      <P>The Formosan landlocked salmon (Oncorhynchus masou formosanus) , one of the
rarest fish in the world, is a subspecies of the seema, which is also found in
Taiwan.  The subspecies is critically endangered and classed as being at high
risk of extinction.</P>
      <P>Once a staple of the Taiwanese aborigine diet, overfishing meant that there were
barely 400 of the salmon left before efforts to conserve and protect them began.
Today, their biggest enemy is pollution, as the fish requires very clean and
cold water to thrive.</P>
      <P>The salmon became landlocked during the last glacial epoch in frigid mountain
streams, and thus its discovery in Taiwan -- a subtropical island -- is
considered a biological miracle.</P>
      <P>Formosan landlocked salmon grow to about 30 cm in length and inhabit cold, slow-
flowing streams with gently sloping beds at elevations above 1,500 meters, such
as the Cijiawan river in the upper reaches of the Tachia river.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Controversial Taitung County Magistrate Kuang Li-chen was released Tuesday after
being questioned by prosecutors for more than four hours over suspected
irregularities related to a just-concluded trip she made to Europe.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors, however, listed Kuang as a suspect to be subject to further
investigation into whether she had squandered public money or rewarded her
grassroots campaign operatives at taxpayer's expense.</P>
      <P>Kuang, accompanied by 13 Taitung county government officials and township
chiefs, returned to Taipei Monday morning after visiting several European
countries, including Italy, in the name of learning about their tourism
promotion measures.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors originally planned to question her upon her return from Taipei to
Taitung, an agricultural backwater in eastern Taiwan, Monday. But Kuang and her
chief secretary disappeared on their way from Hualien airport to Taitung Monday
evening after noticing that prosecutors were trailing them.</P>
      <P>Kuang took the initiative to contact prosecutors Tuesday and showed up at the
Investigation Bureau's Taitung outpost in the afternoon.</P>
      <P>After more than four hours of interrogations,  prosecutors released Kuang but
listed her as a suspect for subsequent probes into graft charges.</P>
      <P>Members of her entourage were also questioned after their return to Taitung
Monday evening and all of them had been released, pending further
investigations.</P>
      <P>Kuang, a stewardess-turned-politician, came under fire after taking 10 township
chiefs and other county officials on a 13-day trip to Europe in late July
despite knowing that Typhoon Fung Wong was approaching. She has also been
criticized for spending millions of taxpayers' money on frequent overseas trips
since taking office two years ago.</P>

    <DATELINE>Washington,  Aug.  5 (CNA)
08/06/08  11:49:59
(By Jorge Liu and Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The leaders of 19 Taiwanese-American groups have jointly written to U.S.
President George W. Bush urging him to "unfreeze" the US$11 billion worth of
arms sales to Taiwan that reportedly have been held up by the Bush
administration.</P>
      <P>In the letter dated Aug. 1 that was delivered to Bush ahead of his departure for
Beijing to attend the opening ceremony of the 2008 Olympic Games, the leaders
said the "real and grave threat" posed by China's military deployment targeting
Taiwan "requires that Taiwan possesses a credible national defense."</P>
      <P>They asked Bush not to forget Taiwan, a "beacon of democracy" to which he
pledged "whatever it took" to help it defend itself in 2001.</P>
      <P>They recalled that in his second inaugural address, Bush told his nation that
"the survival of liberty in our land increasingly depends on the success of
liberty in other lands."</P>
      <P>"The success of liberty is not to be found in China where you are visiting.
Rather it has been achieved in Taiwan across that narrow strait," they noted.</P>
      <P>There have been reports that the Bush administration is holding back on
congressional notifications for the pending arms sales to Taiwan so as not to
upset relations with China ahead of the Olympic Games.</P>
      <P>The list of military hardware reportedly being held up includes anti-tank
missiles,  Apache helicopters,  Patriot PAC-3 missile batteries, diesel-powered
submarines, P3C anti-submarine aircraft and sea-launched Harpoon missiles.</P>
      <P>Taiwan fears that if the notifications are not sent a month before the U.S.
Congress adjourns in September, approval of the sales will be pushed to 2009 and
a new U.S. administration.</P>
      <P>Responding to speculation surrounding the delay in processing the sales, the
U.S. Department of State reiterated last month that Washington has not changed
its policy on arms sales to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said July 18 that the administration
"faithfully implements the Taiwan Relations Act" and that there is an "internal
interagency process" for the U.S. government to consider all military exports,
including sales to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"When the interagency process achieves a final decision for specific arms sales,
we will notify Congress," he said.</P>

      <P>Taiwan businessman Lin Ching-fa, who runs the flagship store in Beijing for
Taiwan-based bicycle maker Giant Manufacturing, was the only citizen from Taiwan
to join the final Olympic torch relay in Beijing, which started Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Lin, 54, was the sixth person in the Beijing relay on Wednesday, which began
with Yang Liwei -- China's first astronaut -- at the Wumen Square in front of
the Forbidden City at 8:05 a.m.</P>
      <P>Lin received the torch from Han Meilin -- the designer of Fuwa, the official
mascot of the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games -- at 8:10 a.m. and passed the torch to
Chang Hao -- one of China's ace Go players -- at 8:11 a.m.</P>
      <P>Other runners on the Beijing Olympic torch relay name list include NBA star Yao
Ming, film director Zhang Yimou, China's Deputy Foreign Minister He Yafei,
pianist Lang Lang, Singaporean song writer/singer Lin Junjie, and 29 other
foreign nationals as well as two Hong Kongers.</P>
      <P>A total of 841 people will join the final stage of the Beijing Olympic torch
relay in the run-up to the official opening of the Games in Beijing at 8: 08
p.m. on Aug. 8. The identity of the last runner who will carry the torch to the
top of the Olympic Stadium and light the Olympic flame remains a secret.</P>
      <P>Lin, a veteran road cycling coach, whose student Hsu Jui-teh has served as the
coach of Taiwan's Olympic road cycling teams in 2004 and 2008, felt extremely
proud to join the final torch relay in Beijing.</P>
      <P>Lin bought an office/shop near the Olympic Stadium, known as the Bird's Nest, in
2002 to open Giant's flagship store, which Lin said has since tripled in value.</P>
      <P>He was elected chairman of the Taiwan Business Association in Beijing in January
this year and two months later, he was informed by the Beijing authorities about
the final torch relay activity.</P>
      <P>As a liaison for Taiwan Olympic committee in Beijing, he will enjoy special
privileges during the Games, including access to all competition  venues  and
locations,  exemption  from  driving restrictions, and seating reserved for
honorary guests at the opening ceremony Aug. 8.</P>
      <P>"Good things come to those who are prepared," a proud Lin said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) will hold a screening committee meeting at
the end of this month to discuss whether to raise the minimum wage, CLA
spokesman Pan Shih-wei confirmed Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Pan, who is also a CLA deputy minister, said that the council will respect the
decision of the screening committee, which is comprised of 22 members, including
the CLA minister and two deputy ministers,  representatives from other
government agencies, and scholars.</P>
      <P>The conclusion of the committee will then be sent to the Executive Yuan for a
final decision, Pan said.</P>
      <P>The nation's minimum monthly wage was raised to NT$17,280 (US$566) from
NT$15,840 in July 1, 2007, benefiting about 1.41 million "marginal" members of
the country's 8.8 million laborers -- including foreign laborers, part-time
workers, senior citizens who have returned to the employment market after
retirement and female workers.</P>
      <P>Due to recent surges in consumer prices, many laborers have expressed the hope
of a further wage increase, and labor groups have appealed to the CLA for an
increase in the minimum wage on their behalf.</P>
      <P>But as labor insurance  and health insurance premiums are calculated based on
the minimum wage, the CLA has expressed worries that a basic wage increase will
put an extra burden on these low-paid workers.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Officials call for FTA negotiations with Thailand</HEADLINE>

08/06/08  15:24:10
(By Yeh Fang-hsun)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan pushed Wednesday for the opening of negotiations on a free trade
agreement (FTA) with Thailand, as part of the government's pledge to promote
economic integration in the Asia Pacific region.</P>
      <P>At an annual meeting of trade officials and industry leaders from Thailand and
Taiwan, local economic officials said that following a pact on economic and
trade cooperation signed between the two sides in 1989, FTA talks should be next
step in intensifying trade cooperation.</P>
      <P>Alfred F. L. Chen, the chairman of the Thailand Committee of the Chinese
International Economic Cooperation Association, a local semi-official trade
promotion body, raised the FTA initiative to Thai economic officials at the
meeting, saying Thailand is becoming more important to Taiwan's economic
expansion.</P>
      <P>He called on the governments of the two countries to seriously consider starting
FTA negotiations and consultations as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The signing of an FTA would be highly conducive to the expansion of both
economies and the enhancement of bilateral trade and investment, Chen said,
explaining the main goals of a trade agreement.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has tried in recent years to forge FTAs with major economies such the
U.S., Japan, Singapore, Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN) countries, but to no avail because of political obstacles.</P>
      <P>Chen hinted that there could be some movement on FTA bids under the new
Kuomintang government because of its commitment to trade expansion throughout
neighboring regions.</P>
      <P>In the face of the recent global economic downturn, Chen said it is time for
Taiwan and Thailand to enhance economic cooperation and market expansion, and
build on recent growth in bilateral trade, which rose 11 percent in 2007 to
US$8.67 billion (NT$265.30 billion).</P>
      <P>Fadah Hsieh, the vice economics minister, echoed Chen by calling for support
from Taiwanese and Thai industrial leaders to help Taiwan join in the economic
integration process of neighboring regions.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said Taiwan is the world's 19th largest economy, and the absence of Taiwan
in any economic integration process would not be in the interest of its
international trading counterparts.</P>
      <P>An integration process without Taiwan is imperfect, Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>The vice minister hinted that a free trade deal with Thailand could help
expedite regional integration by giving Taiwan access to ASEAN's 10-country,
550-million people market, which is expected to form a unified economic
community by 2015.</P>
      <P>Participating Thai officials, including Mangkorn Dhanasarnsilp, vice chairman of
the Federation of Thai Industries, and Arbhorn Manasvanich, executive director
of Thailand Trade and Economic Office, however, did not respond to the FTA issue
in their initial remarks.</P>
      <P>Hsieh also said Taiwan will welcome the participation of Thai investment in the
government's major infrastructure program. The projects outlined under the plan
will need an estimate NT$3.9 trillion in funds.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is currently the third largest foreign investing country in Thailand,
with its total investment of US$12.17 billion there lagging only behind Japan
and the U.S.</P>

      <P>Many students who sought sex consultation at community  pharmacies  were
concerned  about contraception  and pregnancy, according to the results of a
survey released Wednesday by the Bureau of Health Promotion.</P>
      <P>Compared with 30 percent of students who visited the pharmacies simply for
consultation purposes, 19.3 percent intended to buy contraceptive products and
17.3 percent wanted to buy pregnancy test kits, the results showed.</P>
      <P>There were also 2.6 percent who asked for abortion pills.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted by the Union of Pharmacist Associations among 1,349
students aged 24 and younger who visited the sex education consulting stations
at 150 drug stores nationwide between March and June this year.</P>
      <P>The issues most commonly raised by the students during the consultations
included  acne treatment,  height,  menstruation, ejaculation and weight
control.</P>
      <P>Of the 261 students  who visited the pharmacists  to buy contraceptive products,
two were under 12 years of age, 24 were aged 12-15, 73 aged 15-18, and 162 aged
18-24.</P>
      <P>Of the 233 students who went there to buy pregnancy test kits, three were under
12 years of age, 11 were aged 12-15, 74 aged 15-18, 145 aged 18-24, according to
the results.</P>
      <P>Lin Chen-shun, a leading member of the union, urged parents to pay closer
attention to their children and offer them assistance if necessary, noting that
many young people who sought sex consultation were obviously lacking in sex
knowledge but would not approach their parents for information.</P>
      <P>For example, Lin said, among the visitors to the sex consultation stations was a
girl in fourth grade of elementary school who was concerned about becoming
pregnant after having had sexual relations with her boyfriend.</P>
      <P>There was also a junior high school girl who was threatened, followed and
treated violently by her boyfriend because she wished to break up with him, Lin

      <P>A bat exhibition promoting life technology concepts through biology, the arts
and technology opened at the Taipei Zoo's education center Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The exhibition, jointly organized by the National Science Council (NSC) , the
Tainan National University of the Arts, and the Taipei Zoo, is being held as
part of this year's NSC-sponsored Science Season activities.</P>
      <P>The NSC said the bat was chosen as the topic of this year's Science Season
exhibition featuring "life and the sciences" because of its symbolic
significance as the only mammal with the ability to fly.</P>
      <P>The exhibition features three main themes,  including "bat structure and senses,
" which will include displays on "robot bats, " bats' use of sonar for
navigation, and sketches of artist Leonardo Da Vinci's flying machines based on
the wing structure of bats, to name a few.</P>
      <P>The exhibition's second main theme, "bat ecology and species, " will include
displays introducing bat behavior in nature, special bat species indigenous to
Taiwan, as well as vampire bat skulls borrowed from the New York Museum of
Natural History and shown in Taiwan for the first time.</P>
      <P>The third major theme, "bats and humans, and bat conservation, " will also
feature a variety of interesting displays on folk images of bats, as well as
exhibits introducing threats to bat survival and the need to protect bats'
natural habitat.</P>
      <P>The exhibition is set to run through Dec. 7, according to the organizers.</P>

      <P>Visiting Nauruan President Marcus Stephen, an award-winning weightlifter, gave a
demonstration of the sport Wednesday at the National Taiwan Sport University
(NTSU) in Taoyuan County, northern Taiwan, winning enthusiastic applause from
students and his Taiwanese host, President Ma Ying-jeou.</P>
      <P>The visit to NTSU was not on Stephen's scheduled itinerary in Taiwan. It,
however, turned out to be "an amazing trip, " Stephen said, adding that to him,
talking with athletes is more delightful than holding discussions on political
issues.</P>
      <P>In his  address,  Ma said  President  Stephen,  who began weightlifting training
at the age 14,  has won three British Commonwealth gold medals in the sport.</P>
      <P>Stephen is still young, 39 years old, Ma noted, praising Nauru's ability to
produce world-class athletes in a country that is the world's smallest in terms
of land mass.</P>
      <P>Nauru is 21 sq km and its population is around 13,000, according to 2005
statistics. It is one of 23 countries around the world that maintain diplomatic
ties with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>President Stephen, a former chief executive of the International Weightlifting
Federation, said the tour of NTSU reminded him of the days when he was an
athlete, particularly when he smelled the familiar scent of sweat.</P>
      <P>He suggested that Taiwanese athletes take full advantage of the modern equipment
and training venues, which he said Nauru does not have. He added he supports
government's role in pushing for the development of sports.</P>
      <P>President Stephen,  accompanied  by his wife and officials including Minister of
Finance Kieren Keke, arrived in Taiwan Aug. 4 for a five-day state visit. He
will depart on Friday.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan's rice exports skyrocket in first half of year</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan exported 6,634 tons of rice during the January-June period, more than 20
times the amount exported by Taiwan all of last year, the Council of
Agricultural Affairs' Agriculture and Food Agency said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Of that amount, 3,520 tons were exported to Libya, while 3,000 tons were sent to
Turkey, marking a shift away from Taiwan's traditional export markets, namely
Japan and Hong Kong, which have absorbed over 90 percent of Taiwan's total rice
exports in recent years.</P>
      <P>Yu Sheng-fen, deputy director-general of the agency, said the increase in
Taiwan's rice exports this year will not affect domestic rice supplies or
prices.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's rice reserves currently stand at over 370,000 tons, well above the
three-month supply mandated by law, Yu noted.</P>
      <P>He also pointed out that Taiwan's first harvest of this year was abundant,
yielding 1.07 million tons of rice, a significant increase of more than 110,000
tons, or roughly 10 percent, over last year.</P>
      <P>"These amounts are more than enough to meet domestic demand, " Yu added.</P>
      <P>Expanding rice production and overseas sales are an important part of Taiwan's
industrial development, Yu said, adding that the agency will give top priority
to ensuring stable domestic rice supplies and prices while pursuing more export
opportunities amid rising prices.</P>
      <P>He noted that the agency on April 24 announced restrictions on rice exports,
with a minimum price limit of at least US$1,200 per ton being imposed on those
applying to export rice, and the condition that the exporter must "maintain the
international image" of Taiwan's domestically produced rice.</P>
      <P>As for the agency's performance, Yu said that amid the huge fluctuations in
international rice prices in recent months, Taiwan's prices have remained
relatively stable.</P>
      <P>He added that in order to increase domestic supplies, the agency has mapped out
plans to grow rice, as well as corn feed, on Taiwan's fallow land for part of
the year.</P>
      <P>The agency predicts that more than 500,000 tons of rice will be harvested in the
second growing season of this year and that the country's rice reserves will
reach 400,000 tons by the end of the first harvest in May 2009, ensuring
sufficient supplies for the domestic market.</P>

      <P>A Bunun aboriginal teenager, who has battled cancer since he was 11 months old,
was presented with the Love of Life Award for his courage in facing the deadly
disease, at a ceremony to mark the opening of an exhibition featuring his
artwork Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The 15-year-old Ma Han-chung was chosen for the award because of his bravery in
combating cancer and living his life with love, according to Chou Chin-hua, the
founder of the Chou Ta-kuan Cultural and Educational Foundation that sponsors
the award.</P>
      <P>Ma is one of 26 recipients from eight countries of the award, with the remaining
25 to be honored at a ceremony to be held in Taiwan in September.</P>
      <P>The exhibition of his poetry and paintings, along with artworks by late teenage
cancer patient Chou Ta-kuan, is being held at the National Taiwan Democracy
Memorial Hall to raise the visibility of the awards and publicize the September
event, Chou said.</P>
      <P>Ma said after receiving the award that his physical suffering has made him
realize the significance of facing the pain in life with perseverance and
courage and the importance of being grateful and cherishing life.</P>
      <P>The teenager likened his cancer to a grain of sand which makes an oyster
uncomfortable at first when it gets into the oyster shell but it helps turn the
shell into a pretty pearl eventually.</P>
      <P>He added that once he overcame the mental and physical torment caused by his
disease, he gained fortitude and courage.</P>
      <P>Ma, who has long dreamed of becoming a writer and enjoys expressing his views
through painting, said he doesn't know how long he will live. All he can do is
to defy death and live every day as though it's his last.</P>
      <P>The youngster, who recently passed the high school entrance exam to get into
National Taitung Senior High School, was born in 1993 in Taitung, eastern
Taiwan. His father Sun Chang-wu is a Korean missionary who has preached in
Taiwan for nearly 20 years, and his mother Ma Chiu-ching is a Bunun Aborigine.</P>
      <P>Ma Chiu-ching said since his son was diagnosed with a malignant brain tumor at

including chemotherapy and electric therapy, that have left him with muscular
dystrophy and limb deformation.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Twins are not likely to perform as well academically in early adulthood as their
single peers, probably due to a shorter gestation period, lower birth weight and
less attentive parental  care,  researchers  at Mackay Memorial Hospital said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Twins who take the college joint entrance examination tend to score
significantly lower in Chinese, mathematics, and natural sciences than
singletons, said Tsou Meng-Ting, an attending physician and assistant professor
at the hospital.</P>
      <P>"The percentage of university admission among twins is also 2.2 percent lower
than that of children born individually," Tsou said.</P>
      <P>According to the researchers' report published in British Medical Journal, the
main factors that affect the difference in academic performance include the
twins' birth weight, gestational age, birth order,  and sex,  as well as their
parents'  sociodemographic characteristics.</P>
      <P>After studying 1687 twins and 21,897 singletons born in Taiwan between 1983 and
1985, as well as their respective performance in the college admission exams in
2002 and 2003, the researchers speculated that a child's weight at birth might
be the factor most affecting academic performance.</P>
      <P>They observed that twins born weighing less than 2.5 kilograms were the most
likely to suffer academically.</P>
      <P>Tsou said that compared to twins with normal birth weights, twins with low birth
weights are 8.5 percent less likely to be admitted by a university while
singletons with low birth weights are only 3.2 percent less likely than those
who were heavier at birth to get into a university.</P>
      <P>Citing the study's results, researchers involved in the projects suggested that
an improved environment, health care, and day care services can help bridge the
gap between the twins and singletons.</P>
      <P>They also advised mothers who expect to give birth to twins to seek medical
assistance in extending the gestation period and allow the babies to gain more
weight before being born.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Excessive fatigue of workers takes toll on businesses: CLA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 6 (CNA)
08/06/08  18:11:43
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Excessive fatigue among employees has caused an "invisible loss" to businesses,
a survey conducted by the Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) indicated Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The CLA said fatigue of the employees means loss of working hours or days
because of ill health, especially in those areas of work where employees are
most at risk of excessive fatigue.</P>
      <P>The CLA, in its latest survey on 24,996 laborers in 19 trades, found that
employees in the financial and insurance trade ranked top in work fatigue
levels.</P>
      <P>They were followed by workers in real estate, and medical care and social work.</P>
      <P>Among employers and the self-employed, the high risk groups for fatigue were in
the transportation and warehousing sector, accommodation and eatery sector, and
the manufacturing sector.</P>
      <P>The survey found that workers in the high risk groups lose an average of 0.57
days per month due to fatigue.</P>
      <P>If those workers account for 2 percent of total work force, then this will
translate into 1.1 million people who cannot work one day each month, the survey
showed.</P>
      <P>Psychological burdens are the main reasons for feelings of tiredness in
workplace, and this could be caused by rapid working pace, hard work, heavy
workload, insufficient time to finish tasks, the need for sustained
concentration over a long period of time, and insufficient staff.</P>
      <P>The CLA has made suggestions for lowering work fatigue levels, such as employers
working out a reasonable schedule with staff, slowing down the working pace,
workers resting for longer and more frequent periods, and reshuffling staff.</P>
      <P>The survey asked the respondents whether their work left them emotionally
drained, made them feel frustrated, physically exhausted, depleted at the
thought of another work day, and whether they found it hard to get through every
minute at the work place.</P>
      <P>For each of the five questions, there were five possible answers -- always,
often, sometimes, seldom, and never. The score for each answer was 100, 75, 50,
25, and 0, respectively, with the higher score representing the higher level of
fatigue.</P>
      <P>Those workers who receive a combined score of 40 points and above were
considered at the highest fatigue level.</P>
      <P>A combined score of between 25 and 40 points was considered as medium-high
fatigue level, a score of between 15 and 25 as medium-low fatigue level, and a
score of lower than 15 as low-level fatigue.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Financial institutions no longer the "golden bowl" for employees</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  6 (CNA)
08/06/08  18:35:25
(By Yeh Fang-hsun and Emmanuelle Tzeng)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A job at a financial institution was once considered the "golden bowl" by young
job hunters, but in reality this may mean heavier pressure, longer working hours
and higher risk of fatigue than even in blue-collar jobs.</P>
      <P>According to the results of a survey conducted by the Institute of Occupational
Safety and Health under the Council of Labor Affairs (CLA), employees in the
financial and insurance sector ranked highest in terms of work fatigue levels,
followed by workers in real estate business and those in the fields of medical
care and social work.</P>
      <P>"Blue-collar  workers  have fixed working hours,  but many white-collar
employees work under a system of job responsibility, which means they are under
intense pressure, " said Ngou Giok-siong, president of the Taiwan Labour Front,
a non-governmental organization that advocates the rights and well-being of
workers.</P>
      <P>Under the system of job responsibility, employees usually have to devote as much
time as needed to complete their daily tasks, which often means working more
than eight hours a day.</P>
      <P>According to the Labor Standards Law, financial businesses can moderately
prolong the normal eight-hour day of some employees without offering extra pay,
but only for those at or above managerial level. Other staff should be paid
overtime if they work more than eight hours per day, the law stipulates.</P>
      <P>Ngou further noted that most workers in the financial sector -- in private banks
in particular -- dare not ask for overtime pay, due to the deep-rooted concept
that work runs into overtime only if the employee has not been efficient during
regular working hours.</P>
      <P>In public banks, workers usually do not ask for overtime pay due to limited
budgets, he noted.</P>
      <P>The financial predicament brought about by U.S. sub-prime crisis has made the
situation grimmer for bank employees, who now face a new risk of losing their
jobs.</P>
      <P>Asked what kind of role the union can play to promote workers' rights, Ngou said
that it is difficult to negotiate with employers, since the entire society and
the education system focus mainly on the importance of competition.</P>
      <P>In addition, because of the intense corporate culture and computerized staff
rating systems, work in the financial sector is no bed of roses.</P>
      <P>Once known as the "golden boys" who kept regular working hours, and had
relatively reasonable workloads and high job security, financial employees,
including bank staff and investment consultants, are now facing a very volatile
and competitive environment, some local bankers indicated.</P>
      <P>"The good old days are over for financial workers," said a senior bank manager
with 30 years experience, speaking on condition of anonymity.</P>
      <P>The manager told the CNA that with the increased number of banks in Taiwan,
workers need to compete with each other to earn a bonus, or even to keep their
jobs.</P>
      <P>"Nowadays work performance is recorded and evaluated by computer systems," he
noted,</P>
      <P>He said that banking staff, especially those with sales tasks such as attracting
more housing loan clients, are rated based on the number of business deals they
bring in each week or month.</P>
      <P>Hsieh Ching-feng, the vice president of Cathaysite Securities Investment Trust,
said the competitive nature of the corporate culture could be also observed in
the multiple roles of financial employees, which leads to longer working hours.</P>
      <P>"Since the beginning of the 1990s when the government began allowing the
establishment of more private banks, supply in financial services has
outstripped market demand," Hsieh noted.</P>
      <P>The number of employees in the financial service sector was 373,281 in 2007,
almost triple the number 20 years ago, which was 140,542.</P>
      <P>The number of banks in Taiwan reached 44 in recent years, double the number
before the 1990s, according to Hsieh.</P>
      <P>Under the higher demands of work performance, a bank's counter staff might be
asked to take on the task of opening bank accounts or even providing financial
management advice, in the institution's bid to be more competitive and cost-
efficient.</P>
      <P>Because of increased workloads, the average bank worker now gets off work no
earlier than 7 p.m., approximately two hours later compared with two decades
ago, Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>A market watcher said the global financial turbulence that has resulted from the
U.S. credit crunch has exacerbated the work situation, as financial jobs are no
longer iron-clad.</P>
      <P>"The crisis has forced many local banks and investment companies to downsize
their work force in order to control costs, " Chiu Wen-jen, the market director
of 104 Job Bank told CNA.</P>
      <P>As part of their cost reduction measures, many local financial institutions are
choosing not to fill vacancies, which means longer working hours for the
existing staff, Chiu said.</P>
      <P>As a result, "employees who wish to keep their jobs become more diligent,
voluntarily extending their work hours and adding to their responsibilities,"
added Chiu.</P>
      <P>For Taiwan bank workers, the massive lay-offs by major financial institutions in
the U.S. mean more work and higher pressure.</P>

      <P>Members of Taiwan's Mustard Seed Mission built classrooms and donated teaching
materials as part of an 11-day charity activity in impoverished,  mountainous
areas in remote northern Cambodia, a mission official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The 20-member group -- including 16 Taiwanese college students and four mission
workers -- traveled in Cambodia from July 22 to Aug. 1. During the trip, the
students and workers lived in remote villages with no electricity or running
water, and took open-air baths with collected rainwater, said mission official
Liao Hsia-hui.</P>
      <P>At a village in Aural County in northern Cambodia's Kandal Province, the
volunteers helped build a classroom for more than 100 students at Chrok-Cha
Elementary School.</P>
      <P>Before the school was built, more than 100 students in the first through third
grades took classes in a thatched hut with no blackboard.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Mustard Seed Mission delegation was the first foreign social services
group to enter the Aural region and contact local residents. Cambodia's highest
mountain, Phnom Aural, is located in the area.</P>
      <P>The volunteers also distributed rice, oil, soy sauce and other foodstuffs to
needy residents in Prek Anchon village, on the other side of the Mekong River.
The impoverished area used to be tightly controlled by Khmer Rouge rebels.</P>
      <P>Villagers were treated to a free meal hosted by Rotary Club Taipei ex-chief
William Choi. A Taiwan-funded garment maker donated 30,000 articles of clothing
to impoverished children in the area.</P>
      <P>Six or seven members of the Mustard Seed group suffered sunstroke and several
had diarrhea, said Liao, the mission official.</P>

      <P>A staff member of the Kenting National Park Administration Office reminded
parents Tuesday that August at the Kenting National Park in the southernmost
county of Pingtung is a good time to see barn swallows and land crabs.</P>
      <P>The sight of hundreds of swallows perching on telephone cables and crabs
crossing the road to spawn on the seashore provides children with a great
opportunity to learn about the natural environment, said Tsai Yi-jung.</P>
      <P>Hengchun is one of the two main places barn swallows use as a resting place
during their migration in and out of Taiwan, Tsai said adding that they are
among the most common birds seen on the peninsula, along with brown shrikes,
herons, birds of prey and waterfowl.</P>
      <P>Land crabs making their way down to the sea in huge numbers to lay their eggs is
another spectacular scene in Kenting during the month of August, Tsai went on.</P>
      <P>As there is a road separating the crabs' normal habitat and their spawning
grounds, the animals are often crushed beneath the wheels of passing cars, which
has prompted the enaction of traffic restrictions at peak times to protect the
creatures.</P>
      <P>Banana Bay and Port Village are the two main crab spawning areas, according to
Tsai.</P>

      <P>Gou said at a news conference after the meeting that to boost the function of
its headquarters, Hon Hai will continue to increase its investment in R&amp;D
and manufacturing in optoelectronics, medical equipment,  digital  content
electronics,  precision  production equipment and the automation industry.</P>
      <P>These increased investments are expected to generate some 20,000 jobs for
R&amp;D specialists, of which 90 percent will be recruited in Taiwan, and 5,000
technical workers, as well as 5,000 office workers for the global operations and
management areas, of which at least two-thirds of the manpower will be sourced
domestically, Gou said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, he said, to take root deep in Taiwan and take better care of the "Hon
Hai citizens, " his group will channel at least NT$100 billion (US$3.27 billion)
into various projects to build a "digital, environmentally friendly tech town."</P>
      <P>Gou said the "tech town" -- the location of which will be determined after
assessing the willingness of local governments to accommodate such an idea --
will be a digitalized city of about 240,000 residents, where high-tech know-how,
including solar power, wireless broadband systems, electronically controlled
transportation systems and digital-content medical services will be applied to
make it not only environmentally friendly but also a comfortable and easy-to-
live-in community.</P>
      <P>Gou was reluctant to make known the location of his envisioned town, saying that
"land prices will skyrocket as soon as I announce it."</P>
      <P>He noted, however, that his company will submit the investment plans to the
Executive Yuan within six months for government approval.</P>
      <P>Liu gave a thumbs-up to Gou's proposals, saying that after the administration
put forth a series of policies of "great vision, " their implementation needs
the support from the private sector.</P>
      <P>"With plans from the private sector, such as those expected to be put forth by
Hon Hai, the administration's policies could be materialized soon," Liu
predicted.</P>
      <P>"The government is very willing to back up Hon Hai in its visionary development
plans," Liu added.</P>

"supposed to pay attention" to changes in fuel prices even on holidays.</P>
      <P>The Kuomintang government restored in July a floating pricing system that

      <P>A new technology developed by National Cheng Kung University in southern Taiwan,
if applied nationwide, could not only reduce air pollution but also save some
NT$30 billion (US$974.1 million) in fuel consumption, researchers at the
university said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Lee Wen-jhy, a professor at the university's Department of Environmental
Engineering who led the research team, said the results of the seven-year
research program on emulsified oil fuels were published earlier this year in
Environmental Science and Technology, an American bimonthly journal.</P>
      <P>Lee said the aim of the study was to find out whether using oily waste water
emulsified fuel could save energy and reduce air pollutant emissions.</P>
      <P>The study used waste water characterized by a high chemical oxygen demand and
petroleum  hydrocarbons-gasoline  to make an emulsified oil containing 20
percent waste water with 0.1 percent surfactant.</P>
      <P>For comparison, the study also conducted experiments on two other systems --
emulsified heavy oil fuel and water-emulsified oil.</P>
      <P>The results show that all three emulsified fuels could reduce flue gas pollutant
emissions, with the waste water-emulsified oil fuel yielding the most
significant results.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the new technology could save energy to the tune of 14 percent, Lee
said.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, National Cheng Kung University is in the process of applying
for patent rights for the new technique and is discussing technology transfer
with a listed company in Taiwan.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan government has been pushing for the signing of prisoner exchange
pacts with other countries in recent years to better protect the human rights of
prisoners, the Ministry of Justice (MOJ) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>For example, the ministry said, Taiwan recently initialed such an agreement with
Panama to allow convicted nationals from either side to serve their prison terms
in their home countries.</P>
      <P>The agreement will be finalized soon, according to the ministry.</P>
      <P>Language problems, food, culture and religion make it difficult to help
rehabilitate foreign prisoners, the ministry explained in a statement.</P>
      <P>At the same time, allowing prisoners to serve jail terms in their home countries
would make it more convenient for their families to visit them, the ministry
said, adding that this will also help rehabilitate prisoners.</P>
      <P>After more than two years of negotiations, ministry officials reached consensus
with their Panamanian counterparts on the terms of the draft agreement in Panama
Aug. 1, the ministry said.</P>
      <P>At present, Taiwan has no Panamanian prisoners, but Panama is one of the 23
countries that recognizes Taiwan diplomatically.</P>
      <P>The ministry began pushing for the signing of the agreement in September 2005
when the Panamanian court convicted a Taiwanese national of murder and sentenced
him to almost 20 years in jail.</P>
      <P>Although the agreement has not been signed, the Panamanian government
repatriated the murderer, identified as Duanmu Wei-kai, on July 4.</P>
      <P>Duanmu was the captain of a Panama-registered bulk carrier owned by Taipei-based
Shih Wei Navigation Co., when it sailed from the Dominican Republic to Houston,
Texas, in March 2003.</P>
      <P>As the ship was about to enter the harbor at Houston, several crewmen discovered
five Dominican stowaways, who were cast adrift at sea on two flat wooden rafts
and left for dead.</P>
      <P>Two of the stowaways drowned, while three others were arrested when they managed
to reach the shore.</P>
      <P>Zhang Xue-hai, president of the Taiwan Association for Legal Education, said
Tuesday that after the Taiwan-Panama agreement, he hopes the government will
also negotiate with the Thai government to repatriate 115 Taiwanese nationals
serving sentences in Thai jails.</P>
      <P>Thailand, however, has refused to sign such an agreement with Taiwan as it does
not recognize Taiwan's statehood, Zhang said in a statement.</P>
      <P>At present, 115 Taiwanese nationals are serving prison terms in Thailand, 80
percent of whom are convicted of drug-related crimes and are serving average
sentences of 25 years and eight of whom are on death row, according to Zhang.</P>

      <P>An exhibit on sharks is being held at the National Taiwan Museum in Taipei, in
an effort to educate the public on the importance of conserving  the marine
predators.</P>
      <P>Hong Ching-feng, deputy minister of the Cabinet-level Council for Cultural
Affairs, said at the opening ceremony Tuesday that it's critical to educate the
public about sharks, whose numbers are dwindling due to overfishing.</P>
      <P>The exhibit, titled "The Endangered King of the Seas, " runs through Oct. 12 and
is co-sponsored by the National Taiwan Museum and the Life Conservation
Association.</P>
      <P>According to a 2006 study published in "Ecology Letters", up to 73 million
sharks are killed each year worldwide. Many species have become endangered,
particularly those prized for fins that go into expensive "shark fin" soups,
Hong said.</P>
      <P>Sharks are the top of the food chain in many marine ecosystems, and so are a key
indicator  of the overall health of ocean environments. They keep fish
populations further down the food chain in equilibrium, so overfishing sharks
can throw an entire ecosystem out of whack.</P>
      <P>Also Tuesday, Government Information Office Minister Vanessa Yea-ping Shih and
Legislator Tien Chiu-chin of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party
announced the launch of a TV public service spot promoting shark conservation.</P>
      <P>In the ad, 11 Olympic medal winners urge the public not to eat shark's fin, at a
ceremony marking the opening of the Taiwan National Museum shark exhibit.</P>
      <P>The TV spot will air through Friday.</P>

      <P>An avant-garde theater festival in Taipei City will engage audiences and
encourage them to play a pivotal role in the staging of the presentations this
year, organizers said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The two-week festival, called "New Wave Guling, " will begin Aug. 15 at the
Guling Street Avant-garde Theater, with the aim of providing audiences with a
better understanding of the dynamic possibilities of theater in Taiwan through
six experimental works, said an executive of the Body Phase Studio, which is
organizing the event.</P>
      <P>All six works adopted cross-interdisciplinary  talents  and approaches, such as
action art, video art, installation art, dance, literature, and architecture,
the executive said, adding that the borrowing of talents from various fields and
the blending of different artistic elements are the special characteristics of
the presentation.</P>
      <P>The audience will contribute to finding new possibilities through interaction
with the performers, the organizer said, adding that the interaction could take
the form of eye contact, small sounds, or movement.</P>
      <P>The first day's activity will begin with a show called "Play in the dot" which
features visually impaired people's engagement with sounds in daily life. It is
an "unfinished" work, and much of its unknown parts will have to be completed by
the audience, the organizer said.</P>
      <P>Another play called "Easy Come Easy Go" will be staged on that same day. The
show is a combination of stand-up comedy and multimedia elements, the organizer
explained.</P>
      <P>The New Wave Guling activity was launched in 2006 by the Body Phase Studio,
which is a progressive and alternative theater group founded by senior theater
artist Wang Mo-lin to provide theater lovers with an opportunity to experiment
with the art form.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) announced Wednesday that, under its
floating oil price mechanism, the price of oil will reviewed on a weekly basis
instead of monthly so as to more accurately reflect fluctuations in global oil
markets.</P>
      <P>Effective August 8, oil prices will be reviewed every Friday and adjusted based
on the international average oil price during the previous trading days within
the week.</P>
      <P>With the introduction of the new measure, the state-run oil company CPC. Corp.
will announce its prices every Friday, starting this week, Shih Yen-shiang, vice
economic minister said at a news conference Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Shih said that CPC, supervised by the MOEA, will absorb an extra NT$0.5 and
NT$0.6 of the cost per liter of gasoline and diesel, respectively. Since May 28,
CPC has been subsidizing the price of the two fuels by NT1.3 and NT$1.4 a liter,
respectively.</P>
      <P>The subsidies will cost CPC a monthly deficit of NT$2.05 billion.</P>
      <P>Because of a freeze on fuel prices implemented by the former Democratic
Progressive Party government, CPC lost a total of NT$43.15 billion from January
to May this year, including more than NT$10 billion in each of the last three
months of that period.</P>
      <P>After it took office on May 20, the Kuomintang government restored the floating
price mechanism and promptly raised local fuel prices on May 28 by NT$3.9 per
liter, which helped limit the company's losses to NT$3.45 billion in June.</P>
      <P>Apart from having CPC absorb part of the cost of fuel, the government has also
reduced the tax on imported oil commodities by NT$1.3 a liter, in a bid to keep
down domestic oil prices.</P>
      <P>Asked if oil price increases will indeed be limited to 3 percent of the overall
prices as was reported by the local media, Shih said the government is still
discussing the details with the experts and that more decisions will be
announced at the end of the month.</P>
      <P>Shih declined to comment on whether the prices would be adjusted upward or
downward in light of a drop of nearly 17 percent in international oil prices
over the last month to US$117.32 a barrel.</P>
      <P>"We will not speculate on the range of the adjustment to be made this Friday,"
Shih said, adding that the range will be decided after a weekly average had been
determined.</P>
      <P>According to the MOEA, the announcement of fuel prices will be made on Fridays
so that the general public will not have to worry about it on the weekends.</P>

      <P>Chu, fighting in the men's under-58kg division, won Taiwan's second gold medal
in the 2004 Athens Olympic Games at the age of 22. He is under pressure to
retain his title in Beijing.</P>
      <P>Yang, who is Chu's girlfriend, was the champion in the women's under-49kg event
in the Asian taekwondo tournament in April. She is hoping for success in the
women's competition in the Beijing Olympics.</P>
      <P>Su captured a gold medal in the women's under-63kg event in the Doha Asian Games
in August 2007, while Sung won the gold medal in the men's under-72kg category
in the 2007 Beijing WTF World Taekwondo Championships.</P>
      <P>Taekwondo is one of a few sports categories in which Taiwan has a good chance to
win medals. In the Athens Olympics in 2004, three of the country's five medals
were won in the taekwondo competition, including two gold medals. The other two
medals were won in archery.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOE required to compensate female university post applicant</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  6 (CNA)
08/06/08  22:05:01
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taipei District Court ruled Wednesday that the Ministry of Education (MOE)
and a screening committee member should compensate a female applicant for a top
university post to the tune of NT$2 million (US$65,570) and publish apologies to
her in four major newspapers.</P>
      <P>The plaintiff in the case, Chen Jean-lien, vice president of National Taiwan
University of Science and Technology, filed the lawsuit after she was rejected
in the screening process to fill a post as president of National Ilan University
in April 2006. Chen was one of three applicants interviewed for the position.</P>
      <P>She stated in the lawsuit that Chang Tsung-jen, a member of the Ministry of
Education's screening panel, had asked her in the interview whether she thought
"a woman candidate would be in an unfavorable position to raise money?"</P>
      <P>Chen said she believed the ministry's screening and selection process for the
position was discriminatory against women, had violated the Gender Equality in
Employment Law and had hurt her name.</P>
      <P>The Taipei court said in its ruling that although a candidate's ability to raise
money can be taken into consideration in the screening process to select a
university president, gender and fund-raising ability are not directly relevant.</P>
      <P>The ministry's choice for the position should have been based on experience,
ability and social activities -- not on gender, the court said.</P>
      <P>The court made reference to the U.S. presidential primary, noting that one of
the Democratic candidates Hillary Rodman Clinton had shown a strong ability to
raise funds. The allegation that women are at a disadvantage in raising funds is
certainly not a fact, the court stated.</P>
      <P>The court said that Chang's questions were discriminatory, and had "set up an
unnecessary and unreasonable hurdle in the path of securing the post," damaging
Chen's name and her rights under the Gender Equality in Employment Law.</P>
      <P>In addition, the court stated that when Chen petitioned the Ministry of
Education (MOE) on the matter, the ministry had dragged its feet under the
pretext of having a procedural problem and did not launch an investigation into
the issue until Chen filed the lawsuit.</P>
      <P>The MOE even tried to justify its discriminatory actions, the court stated,
adding that this indicated supervisory flaw.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government of Kaohsiung county, which hosts Taiwan's five last shadow puppet
troupes, said Wednesday that its efforts to preserve and promote traditional
puppetry have borne fruit, as up to 600,000 people from at home and abroad have
attended the shows over the past six years.</P>
      <P>In a statement released Wednesday, the Cultural Bureau of the southern Taiwan
county outlined its efforts to revive the art form. Its works included building
the country's only Shadow Play Museum, publishing educational materials for
junior high and elementary school students, and organizing puppetry contests
among schools to encourage young performers and to upgrade the theater art.</P>
      <P>Over the past six years, 1,700 Kaohsiung county school students and teachers
took part in shadow puppet shows, and five professional shadow puppet troupes
staged 81 performances around Taiwan from 2002 to 2007, attracting audiences of
almost 150,000, according to the statement.</P>
      <P>Shadow puppetry was brought to Taiwan from southern China over 300 years ago,
and was once popular in the farming areas in the south of the island. Older
puppeteers in the county have estimated that at least 100 shadow puppet troupes
existed in southern Taiwan in the final years of the Qing dynasty (1644-1911).</P>
      <P>Traditionally, the shadow plays, commonly known as leader shows, are performed
with figures made from leather. The figures are moved behind an illuminated
backdrop  and the shadows are actually silhouettes seen by the audience in
profile or face on.</P>
      <P>This form of puppetry is now seen by the local government as a valuable cultural
asset.</P>

      <P>Police raided 21 locations around Taoyuan County in northern Taiwan Wednesday
and arrested 13 members of the Bamboo Union gang.</P>
      <P>The 13 gangsters all belong to the same cell called Hsin Tang -- one of the
gang's 24 cells.</P>
      <P>Among the detainees was the cell's 40-year-old leader, identified by the surname
Chang.</P>
      <P>According to police, Chang turned himself in under an amnesty program in 1997
and was exempted from punishment after giving the assurance that he would
withdraw from the gang.</P>
      <P>However, police found recently that he was still active in the Bamboo Union and
had been promoted to cell leader. Furthermore, Chang even joined the Taiwan
District of Kiwanis International and became a director of its cultural
division.</P>
      <P>Citing the offenses allegedly  committed by Chang and his followers, police said
they used a financial consultation firm as a cover to engage in giving usurious
loans to those in debt and using intimidation and force to obtain repayment at
exorbitant interest rates.</P>
      <P>The 13 gangsters were being interrogated and will be referred to the local
public prosecutors office to face a series of charges.</P>
      <P>The Bamboo Union is the largest of the three gangs in Taiwan, the other two
being the Four Seas and the Celestial Way.</P>
      <P>The number of Bamboo Union members is estimated at more than 10,000.  Their
criminal  enterprises  include  gambling,  drug trafficking, prostitution,

    <HEADLINE>Applications for lump-sum labor pension payment decreasing: CLA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 6 (CNA)
08/06/08  23:42:57
(By Ruth Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>There have been fewer applications for lump sum labor insurance pension payments
since a new payout system was approved July 17, a Council of Labor Affairs (CLA)
official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The new system will allow retired workers, 60 and over, the choice of collecting
their pensions in one lump sum or accepting monthly benefits until death. The
current system stipulates that retired laborers can only receive their pensions
in one lump sum, the value of which risks being eroded by inflation  and
improper investment.</P>
      <P>According to Tsai Chi-an, president of the CLA's Bureau of Labor Insurance, the
newly approved system, which will go into effect from Jan.1, 2009, will
guarantee better pensions for some 8.8 million Taiwanese wage earners after
retirement.</P>
      <P>Monthly pension payments to retired workers over a period of eight years and one
month will exceed the lump sum payment, and if a worker dies before the monthly
sums reach a total equivalent to the lump sum amount, the difference will be
paid to the family of the deceased, a CLA official explained in July.</P>
      <P>The country's labor insurance fund had shrunk rapidly from NT$420 billion at the
end of last year to NT$327 billion at the end of June because lots of retired
workers had chosen the lump-sum payment, Tsai said.</P>
      <P>There were about 2,290 applications per day for the single from January to July
17 this year, but the number dropped to 1,066 from July 18-31, Tsai said, adding
that the new system is influencing retired workers' decisions on the issue.</P>
      <P>There were more than 40,000 applications for the lump-sum payment in July, Tsai
added.</P>
      <P>Luo Wu-hu, the bureau's vice president, said that previous to July 17, the
bureau had recorded an average 17 cases per day of applicants revoking their
decision to apply for the lump sum payment. That number jumped to 40 per day
after the new system was approved, Luo said, adding that this was an indication
that more people are now aware of the benefits of the monthly pension payment.</P>
      <P>Applicants for the lump sum payment can change their minds before the money is
remitted to their accounts, Luo said.</P>
      <P>They have less than two weeks to change their decision, Luo said, emphasizing
that once the money is paid into the applicants' accounts no reversals can be
made.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Ma annuls predecessor's classification of state affairs funds files</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou has nullified the classification of a collection of
documents allegedly implicating his predecessor in a high-profile "state affairs
fund" embezzlement case, a Presidential Office official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The move to annul former President Chen Shui-bian's classification of the
collection of files will assist prosecutors in investigating whether Chen was
involved in the NT$14.8 million "state affairs fund" abuse case.</P>
      <P>The files in question are mainly receipts and records of Chen's use of
discretionary "state affairs funds" from 2000 through June 30, 2006.</P>
      <P>"After careful reflection, President Ma decided to remove the documents from the
Presidential Office's 'strictly confidential' category," Presidential Office
Secretary-General Chan Chun-po said at a news conference.</P>
      <P>The Taipei District Court obtained  the documents  from a prosecutorial team
that indicted Chen's wife and three of Chen's aides in November 2006 on charges
of corruption and forgery for allegedly misappropriating NT$14.8 million
(US$450,000) from the "state affairs fund" -- a special allowance set aside for
the president's discretionary use for official purposes.</P>
      <P>Chen proclaimed the files as "strictly confidential" Sept. 6, 2007 in accordance
with the Classified National Security Information Protection (CNSIP) Act. The
declaration has since stalled the district court proceedings.</P>
      <P>Although the Special Investigation Task Force under the Supreme Prosecutors
Office listed Chen as a co-suspect in the alleged embezzlement case almost
immediately after Chen stepped down from the presidency May 20, investigations
into his suspected role in the case have made little progress because of the
classification of the files.</P>
      <P>The task force asked President Ma to declassify the files shortly after he
assumed office. Ma then formed a special team to scrutinize the collection of
files.</P>
      <P>Chan said Ma and the special team have pored over every file and record in the
collection and have concluded that "there will be no such problem as endangering
the country's interests in making public the documents in question."</P>
      <P>Chen's office denounced the move, arguing that according to the law, documents
classified as "strictly confidential" should not be declassified ever.</P>
      <P>"President Ma's decision has run counter to the law and the Constitution,"
Chen's office said in a press statement.</P>
      <P>However, Presidential Office spokesman Wang Yu-chi rebuffed Chen's argument,
claiming that those documents and records should not have been classified in the
first place as they did not meet the standards of "strictly confidential" as
prescribed in the CNSIP Act.</P>
      <P>Chu Chao-liang, spokesman for the Special Investigation Task Force, hailed the
nullification of the classification, saying the move will be very helpful to the
investigation.</P>
      <P>The district court also said it will resume handling of the roles of the former
first lady and three former officials in the case.</P>
      <P>Chen has denied any wrongdoing in the case, insisting that judicial process will
eventually clear his name.</P>

      <P>The ruling Kuomintang (KMT) suspended controversial Taitung County Magistrate
Kuang Li-chen's membership right Wednesday after her recent trip to Europe drew
a storm of criticism and investigations by prosecution authorities.</P>
      <P>"The punitive measure was based on a suggestion passed by the party's ethics and
integrity commission with a vote of 11-6, " said Juan Kang-meng, chairman of the
party's Evaluation and Discipline Committee.</P>
      <P>Chang Po-ya, convener of the ethics and integrity commission, said Kuang's move
has marred the party's image as her overseas trip caused wide attention and
controversy.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Chang said prosecutors have launched a probe into suspected
irregularities related to Kuang's latest overseas trip which took her to several
European countries in the name of learning from their experience in tourism
promotion. The Control Yuan, the country's  supreme watchdog  body monitoring
senior officials' integrity, is also investigating the case.</P>
      <P>Juan said the KMT discipline committee will decide whether to mete out harsher
penalty for Kuang in terms of the results of judicial and Control Yuan
investigations.</P>
      <P>Kuang, a stewardess-turned-politician, came under fire after taking 10 township
chiefs and other county officials on a 13-day trip to Europe in late July
despite knowing that Typhoon Fung Wong was approaching. She has also been
criticized for spending millions of taxpayers' money on frequent overseas trips
since taking office two years ago.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOE required to compensate female university post applicant</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taipei District Court ruled Wednesday that the Ministry of Education (MOE)
and a screening committee member should compensate a female applicant for a top
university post to the tune of NT$2 million (US$65,570) and publish apologies to
her in four major newspapers.</P>
      <P>The plaintiff in the case, Chen Jean-lien, vice president of National Taiwan
University of Science and Technology, filed the lawsuit after she was rejected
in the screening process to fill a post as president of National Ilan University
in April 2006. Chen was one of three applicants interviewed for the position.</P>
      <P>She stated in the lawsuit that Chang Tsung-jen, a member of the Ministry of
Education's screening panel, had asked her in the interview whether she thought
"a woman candidate would be in an unfavorable position to raise money?"</P>
      <P>Chen said she believed the ministry's screening and selection process for the
position was discriminatory against women, had violated the Gender Equality in
Employment Law and had hurt her name.</P>
      <P>The Taipei court said in its ruling that although a candidate's ability to raise
money can be taken into consideration in the screening process to select a
university president, gender and fund-raising ability are not directly relevant.</P>
      <P>The ministry's choice for the position should have been based on experience,
ability and social activities -- not on gender, the court said.</P>
      <P>The court made reference to the U.S. presidential primary, noting that one of
the Democratic candidates Hillary Rodman Clinton had shown a strong ability to
raise funds. The allegation that women are at a disadvantage in raising funds is
certainly not a fact, the court stated.</P>
      <P>The court said that Chang's questions were discriminatory, and had "set up an
unnecessary and unreasonable hurdle in the path of securing the post," damaging
Chen's name and her rights under the Gender Equality in Employment Law.</P>
      <P>In addition, the court stated that when Chen petitioned the Ministry of
Education (MOE) on the matter, the ministry had dragged its feet under the
pretext of having a procedural problem and did not launch an investigation into
the issue until Chen filed the lawsuit.</P>
      <P>The MOE even tried to justify its discriminatory actions, the court stated,

attended the shows over the past six years.</P>
      <P>In a statement released Wednesday, the Cultural Bureau of the southern Taiwan
county outlined its efforts to revive the art form. Its works included building
the country's only Shadow Play Museum, publishing educational materials for
junior high and elementary school students, and organizing puppetry contests
among schools to encourage young performers and to upgrade the theater art.</P>
      <P>Over the past six years, 1,700 Kaohsiung county school students and teachers
took part in shadow puppet shows, and five professional shadow puppet troupes
staged 81 performances around Taiwan from 2002 to 2007, attracting audiences of
almost 150,000, according to the statement.</P>
      <P>Shadow puppetry was brought to Taiwan from southern China over 300 years ago,
and was once popular in the farming areas in the south of the island. Older
puppeteers in the county have estimated that at least 100 shadow puppet troupes
existed in southern Taiwan in the final years of the Qing dynasty (1644-1911).</P>
      <P>Traditionally, the shadow plays, commonly known as leader shows, are performed
with figures made from leather. The figures are moved behind an illuminated
backdrop  and the shadows are actually silhouettes seen by the audience in
profile or face on.</P>
      <P>This form of puppetry is now seen by the local government as a valuable cultural
asset.</P>

      <P>Police raided 21 locations around Taoyuan County in northern Taiwan Wednesday
and arrested 13 members of the Bamboo Union gang.</P>
      <P>The 13 gangsters all belong to the same cell called Hsin Tang -- one of the
gang's 24 cells.</P>
      <P>Among the detainees was the cell's 40-year-old leader, identified by the surname
Chang.</P>
      <P>According to police, Chang turned himself in under an amnesty program in 1997
and was exempted from punishment after giving the assurance that he would
withdraw from the gang.</P>
      <P>However, police found recently that he was still active in the Bamboo Union and
had been promoted to cell leader. Furthermore, Chang even joined the Taiwan
District of Kiwanis International and became a director of its cultural
division.</P>
      <P>Citing the offenses allegedly  committed by Chang and his followers, police said
they used a financial consultation firm as a cover to engage in giving usurious
loans to those in debt and using intimidation and force to obtain repayment at
exorbitant interest rates.</P>
      <P>The 13 gangsters were being interrogated and will be referred to the local
public prosecutors office to face a series of charges.</P>
      <P>The Bamboo Union is the largest of the three gangs in Taiwan, the other two
being the Four Seas and the Celestial Way.</P>
      <P>The number of Bamboo Union members is estimated at more than 10,000.  Their
criminal  enterprises  include  gambling,  drug trafficking, prostitution,
construction rackets, and extortion. The gang is also active in China, other

    <TEXT>
      <P>Ruling Kuomintang Chairman Wu Poh-hsiung departed Thursday for Beijing to attend
the opening ceremony of the 2008 Olympic Games.</P>
      <P>Wu said Taiwan must not be absent from such a grand sports event that attracts
the attention of billions of people around the world, because "our participation
represents our desire for international space."</P>
      <P>Wu said that apart from attending the opening ceremony, he will visit the
Olympic athletes' village to cheer on Taiwanese athletes and will watch a
baseball game featuring the Chinese Taipei team before returning home next week.</P>
      <P>He revealed that other than that, he also "has some serious work to do" during
his trip, as he did on his last visit to Beijing in May, when he discussed with
China authorities matters concerning the launch of direct cross-Taiwan  Strait
charter flights and the admission of Chinese tourists to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Asked if he will complain to China about the low number of Chinese tourist
arrivals to Taiwan since the July 18 opening to sightseers from China, Wu
explained that China had recently imposed stricter controls on overseas travel
by its citizens because it was busy preparing for the Olympic Games.</P>
      <P>Wu said he believes the situation will improve significantly after the Games end
in late August.</P>
      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party has expressed strong disapproval of
Wu's plans to attend the Olympics opening ceremony, even as the government is
trying to dissuade the heads of states of Taiwan's diplomatic allies from
joining the event.</P>
      <P>The DPP has also suggested that Taiwan's Olympic team boycott the opening
ceremony to protest against the arrangement of the opening ceremony procession,
saying that it implies a downgrading of Taiwan's status to that of an
administrative region of China.</P>
      <P>During's Friday's ceremony, the order of appearance of the procession will be
based on the countries' names in Chinese. Under this arrangement, Taiwan's
"Chinese Taipei " team and Hong Kong's "Hong Kong, China" team -- translated in
Chinese as "Zhonghua Taibei" and "Zhongguo Xianggang, " respectively -- will be
positioned very close to each other, with only the Central African Republic in
between.</P>
      <P>This model is different from past precedent, in which the processions were
arranged in alphabetical order and Taiwan was grouped under the "T" section.</P>
      <P>Under an agreement signed in 1981 between the Chinese Taipei Olympic Committee
and the International Olympic Committee (IOC), the "Chinese Taipei Olympic
Committee" was abbreviated as "TPE" and was thus listed under the "T" section in
the IOC's directory.</P>

      <P>Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng left Thursday for Japan to attend the
39th annual conference of the Asia Pacific Parliamentarians' Union (APPU) and
seek to allay Japan's concern over recent improvement in Taiwan-China ties.</P>
      <P>Speaking prior to his departure at Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport, Wang
said he will assure the Japanese side that the traditional Taipei-Tokyo
friendship remains unaffected by warming cross-Taiwan Strait ties,  to help
defuse Tokyo's reservations regarding the issue.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan and Japan should further advance their ties based on mutual trust and
understanding, and this is the goal of our efforts," he said.</P>
      <P>According to Wang, a five-member panel of key officials from the Presidential
Office, the Executive Yuan and the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) has set this as the
major purpose of his current eight-day visit to Japan.</P>
      <P>More than 10 Taiwanese lawmakers are accompanying Wang on the tour, and they are
slated to return to Taiwan Aug. 13.</P>
      <P>The legislative speaker is slated to meet leaders of Japan's ruling and
opposition parties and lawmakers, including dietman Taro Aso, a former foreign
minister who recently accepted an offer to serve as secretary-general of the
governing Liberal Democratic Party, thus becoming the number two figure in the
party.</P>
      <P>In response to allegations that President Ma Ying-jeou harbors anti-Japan
sentiments, Wang said the Japanese side should be clear on the president's
stance since Ma explained his position in this regard to a group of visiting
Japanese dietmen early this week in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the APPU meeting will open Sunday in Tokyo.</P>
      <P>The legislative speaker will also lobby for support for Taiwan's bid to host the
2009 APPU annual meeting.</P>
      <P>Taiwan-Japan ties became the focus of attention after a collision between a
Taiwanese recreational fishing boat and a Japanese coast guard patrol ship last
month in waters near the disputed Tiaoyutai Islands. Taipei, Beijing and Tokyo
all claim sovereignty over the disputed island chain in the east China Sea.</P>
      <P>Both Ma and Wang have pledged that Taipei-Tokyo ties will not be affected by the
incident nor by cross-strait detent.</P>

      <P>China Steel Corp.'s gross revenues for July reached NT$25.996 billion (US$842.66
million), marking a new monthly record high for Taiwan's largest and only
integrated steelmaker, the company announced Thursday.</P>
      <P>The figure represented an increase of 52.5 percent over the NT$17.046 billion
recorded for the same month last year, and a rise of 9.65 percent over the
previous month's sales.</P>
      <P>It also marked the sixth time in China Steel's history that its monthly sales
surpassed NT$20 billion.</P>
      <P>The company produced a total of 872,202 tons of steel products in July, up 1.65
percent over June, and sold 891,044 tons for the month, up 4.68 percent.</P>
      <P>China Steel management said that because mid- and down-stream manufacturers
usually make inventory in June and because heavy rains during the month slowed
down progress on building projects, the volume steel products delivered for the
month was down.</P>
      <P>However, with orders from manufacturers gradually returning to normal in July,
coupled with a 17.8-percent increase in wholesale prices for steel products, the
company's gross revenues rose for the month, according to management.</P>
      <P>Analysts have said that China Steel's sales volume could decline in the third
quarter amid slipping demand but that the company could register further record-
high gross revenues because of soaring wholesale prices.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Thursday that it will leave it up to
the Control Yuan to determine whether there were any administrative errors in a
diplomatic farce in which the ministry was duped out of US$30 million in foreign
aid funds.</P>
      <P>MOFA spokesman Henry Chen said at a regular press briefing that an internal
investigation had found that the process of allocation of funds had fallen short
of the foreign ministry's standards of professionalism,  therefore,  the
investigation report has been submitted to the Control Yuan to determine whether
there had been administrative errors in the fiasco.</P>
      <P>"The ministry's investigation into the Papua New Guinea case did not target
anyone, but teh MOFA did have the responsibility to look into the case, and the
general public also had high expectations regarding the details of the incident,
" Chen said, denying that any names or specific positions were mentioned in the
report.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks in response to a reporter's reference to a United Daily
report that Foreign Minister Francisco H.L. Ou had delivered the internal
investigation report in person to the Control Yuan, and had submitted a request
for his predecessor to be investigated.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the Law on Discipline of Civil Servants, Ou has formally
requested the Control Yuan to investigate former Foreign Minister James Huang
and Huang's close aide Chang Chian-sheng in connection with the diplomatic fraud
case, the paper claimed.</P>
      <P>The news report noted that it was unprecedented for an incumbent foreign
minister to submit a request for his predecessor to be investigated.</P>
      <P>Huang, who said he remained "upright and honest" in the case, resigned May 6 as
foreign minister. Chang's appointment as deputy representative to Malaysia was
later canceled, as he was one of the few persons with access to information on
Taiwan's secret diplomatic endeavors.</P>
      <P>Chen said Ou,  who met with Control Yuan President  Wang Chien-hsuan on Aug. 4,
gave the assurance that the foreign ministry would do all it could to facilitate
the Control Yuan's investigation into the case and it would set up a rigorous
monitoring mechanism to prevent any repeat of the incident.</P>
      <P>The case first came to light on May 1 when a Singaporean daily reported that the
country's  High Court had approved Taiwan's application for an injunction to
freeze an account held jointly by two middlemen, Ching Chi Ju and Wu Shihi-tsai.</P>
      <P>Wu and Ching were commissioned in 2006 to broker a deal between Taiwan and Papua
New Guinea for the establishment of diplomatic relations.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's foreign ministry by Sept. 14, 2006 had remitted US$29.8 million into a
Singaporean bank account held jointly by Wu and Ching. However, after the
negotiations with Papua New Guinea fell through, Ching went missing, along with
the funds.</P>
      <P>The diplomatic  bungle not only disgraced the then ruling Democratic Progressive
Party, which was already mired in several corruption scandals, but also
embarrassed Taiwan in the international community.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's government has long been criticized domestically for engaging
incheckbook diplomacy-- using money to convince usually small impoverished
countries to establish diplomatic ties with Taipei instead of with Beijing.</P>

      <P>The state postal company Chunghwa Post Co. announced Thursday that on Aug 20 it
will officially resume the issuance of postage stamps bearing the country name,
Republic of China, after a suspension of more than one year under a
Taiwanization policy  of  the  former  Democratic  Progressive  Party  (DPP)
administration.</P>
      <P>The first issue marking the resumption will be a souvenir sheet comprised of
four NT$5 stamps featuring the Yimin Festival, the company said. The festival,
mainly celebrated by the Hakka people, is observed on the 20th day of the
seventh lunar month and falls on Aug. 20 this year.</P>
      <P>The print on the stamps will read "Chunghua Minkuo" in Chinese and "Republic of
China (Taiwan) " in English, according to the company.</P>
      <P>Chunghwa Post, which was renamed "Taiwan Post Co." in February 2007 by the
former DPP government, officially reverted its original name Aug. 4.</P>
      <P>From Feb. 28, 2007 until Aug. 1, 2008, "Taiwan Post Co." released a total of 33
issues of postage stamps marked "Taiwan" in Chinese and English. As an
exception, an issue released May 20 to mark President Ma Ying-jeou's
inauguration bore the words, "Republic of China, " at the request of the
president, who believes the country's official name should be used on postage
stamps.</P>
      <P>The name "Taiwan Post Co." was adopted as part of a DPP-backed campaign to
change the names of state-owned enterprises  that contained references to China.
"Chunghwa" means "Chinese" or "China" in the Chinese language.</P>
      <P>The DPP argued that the name change campaign would help avoid confusion
resulting from Taiwanese organizations carrying names similar to those used by
organizations in China.</P>
      <P>However, the new Kuomintang administration insisted that the name change process
was unlawful, because bills introduced by the former DPP administration to amend
the Postal Service Act and a statute on the establishment of the Chunghwa Post
Co. to change the laws' references to the company were never approved by the
Legislative Yuan, in which the KMT enjoys a strong majority.</P>

    <HEADLINE>44% of Taiwanese have experienced violence in relationships: survey</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A total of 44 percent of married and single Taiwanese have been on the receiving
end of some form of violence from their spouses or companions, according to the
results of an online survey released Thursday.</P>
      <P>A total of 11,626 valid samples were collected from Taiwan residents in the
survey, which was jointly conducted by the Modern Women's Foundation and Yahoo!
Taiwan News between July 24 and Aug. 3.</P>
      <P>Lai Fang-yu, a lawyer and foundation board member, said at a press conference
held to unveil the results that the survey revealed three major findings.</P>
      <P>First of all, the survey showed that most people's awareness of violence in a
relationship has increased, with 52 percent of the respondents saying that the
definition of "violence" is not only restricted to physical violence and
intimidation but also includes verbal abuse and insults, controlling of
another's behavior, and emotional harm, Lai said. Only 4.9 percent of the
respondents said they thought violence was defined only as physical abuse.</P>
      <P>Secondly, Lai continued, the survey found that men and women have different
feelings regarding violence in a relationship, with men saying that what they
fear most is being insulted or degraded by their partner, while women said they
most feared bodily harm and physical threats against themselves or their family
members.</P>
      <P>The third major finding of the survey was that women were more conscious of
violence in a relationship, Lai said, pointing out that 46.1 percent of female
respondents said they had been the victims of such violence, as compared to 39.7
percent of the male respondents.</P>
      <P>The survey also asked respondents how they would react the first time they felt
like the victim of violence in a relationship. In response, 39.3 percent said
they would try to communicate with their partner to try to improve the
situation, 24.4 percent mentioned they would break up with their partner, 18.3
percent said they would ignore the problem and try to find some form of escape,
12.5 percent said that they would seek assistance from a third party, and 5.5
percent claimed they would respond in kind with violence.</P>
      <P>Among those  who were actual  victims  of violence  in a relationship, 22.6
percent said they had been successful in putting an end to it by using one of
the above mentioned methods, 43.7 percent said they had broken up with their
partner, and 33.7 percent said they continued to endure the violence, with some
doing so even after their relationship ended, according to the survey results.</P>

      <P>A student volunteer team from Chinese Culture University in the northern city of
Taipei worked in Malaysia July 24-Aug. 3, a university official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The volunteer team was comprised of 12 outstanding leaders of student's clubs at
the university, said Chen Tsung-hsien, director of the university's
extracurricular activities division.</P>
      <P>The volunteer team was the first of its kind from the university, he stressed.</P>
      <P>During their stay in the Southeast Asian nation, the volunteers communicated
with disabled people at a mental development center, using sign language, and
drilled a sense of esprit de corps into orphans at a care center through team
competitions and group work. They also danced and sang along with elderly
residents during a visit to a rest home, according to Chen.</P>
      <P>The team members raised MYR$1,000 (US$305.2) by auctioning off Taiwanese
delicacies at a charity bazaar, and donated the proceeds to social welfare
associations, Chen explained.</P>
      <P>The student volunteer team returned to Taiwan Monday, according to Chen.</P>
      <P>The university has decided to send student teams to do volunteer work in foreign
countries in the summer and winter vacations each year, he disclosed.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's children appear lukewarm about engaging in outdoor activities, as
nearly 60 percent of elementary school students in the country said they were
spending most of their leisure time "playing at home," according to a recent
survey.</P>
      <P>The survey on school children's leisure activities compiled by the Education,
Parenting and Family Style magazine was conducted May 26 to June 17. A total of
4,037 valid questionnaires were collected, including 3,122 from fifth to eighth
graders, 852 from classroom teachers and 63 from school principals.</P>
      <P>When asked about the activities they most frequently engaged in, 56.8 percent of
the students who responded to the survey indicated "Internet surfing," while
54.8 percent pointed to "doing exercise, " and 54 percent mentioned "watching TV
or DVD," the data showed.</P>
      <P>Over 70 percent of homeroom teachers who responded to the survey thought their
students had serious problems with interpersonal relationships, and that those
who did not have enough time to play had more difficulties making friends and
were more reluctant to go to school.</P>
      <P>More than 90 percent of the teacher respondents agreed that the main reason
behind Taiwanese students' lack of learning motivation is that their time is
usually filled with assigned learning sessions. The survey showed 60 percent of
student respondents  attended after-school classes or cram schools, with one-
third of them spending more than three hours every day at cram schools.</P>
      <P>In another survey on parents' anxiety conducted among 656 parents from July
20-22, 90 percent said they did not think that "education in Taiwan had improved
over the past decade."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 76 percent of the respondents said they were not confident about
their children's future, and 56 percent did not believe public schools could
equip their children for the future.</P>
      <P>Most parent respondents said "strengthening character training" and "improving
teacher evaluation" were the priority issues they most wanted the Ministry of
Education to address.</P>

      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan directed two government agencies Thursday to help local
fruit growers explore the Chinese market, taking advantage of weekend cross-
Taiwan Strait charter flights and Taiwan's opening to ordinary Chinese tourists
in early July.</P>
      <P>Liu asked the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) and the Council of Agriculture
(COA) to assess the feasibility of allowing Chinese tourists to place orders in
Taiwan and take delivery in China.</P>
      <P>He made the request during the weekly Executive Yuan meeting.</P>
      <P>COA officials suggested that special stores be set up at Taiwan's major gateway
-- Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport -- to sell locally grown fruit to
departing Chinese visitors. Such visitors could then take delivery of their
orders at designated pick-up spots in the Beijing and Shanghai airports.</P>
      <P>The COA officials suggested that the MAC resolve quarantine issues through
negotiations between the two sides.</P>
      <P>In the meeting, COA officials also briefed the premier on a current campaign to
promote four popular types of Taiwanese fruit to Chinese consumers during the
Beijing Olympics. They also discussed issues relating to cross-strait tourism
and direct passenger and cargo flights between the two sides.</P>
      <P>Beijing and Taipei in June inked a deal on weekend passenger charter flights,
but don't yet have a similar deal for cargo flights.</P>
      <P>Liu instructed COA officials step up their efforts to help local fruit farmers
better distribute their products in foreign markets including the United States,

    <HEADLINE>Chinese ICT market opportunities await Taiwan vendors</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug 7 (CNA)
08/07/08  18:08:09

    <TEXT>
      <P>In the face of the global economic downturn, the Chinese market for information
and communication technology (ICT) products will continue to outstrip other
markets, and Taiwanese vendors should capitalize on this, a local research body
said Thursday.</P>
      <P>"Because of the slow growth in both the international and domestic market
demand, China's integrated circuit (IC) production value in 2008 is estimated to
rise by only 20 percent, compared with 40 percent in 2006, " Eirc Chang, the
vice president of Topology Research Institute, said Thursday at a seminar.</P>
      <P>According to the research unit, China's IC production value in 2007 was 125
billion yuan (US$18.24 billion), representing an annual growth of 24.4 percent.</P>
      <P>China's economic growth, presented as gross domestic product (GDP), also showed
a slower growth rate of 10.4 percent in the first half of 2008, down from the
12.2 percent recorded in the same period last year.</P>
      <P>However, Chang and other analysts from the research unit noted that China's IC
industry is still the envy of the world, as the overall production value of the
global IC industry grew at a meager 5 percent in the first two quarters of 2008.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan's vendors should focus on the three most popular ICT products in China
-- LCD TVs, mobile phones and notebook computers -- when exploring business
opportunities there," Chang suggested.</P>
      <P>The second quarter market output of LCD TVs in China grew at a stellar 82.7
percent year-on-year, reaching 2.8 million units, due to higher demand sparked
by the Beijing Olympic Games in August, according to the research unit.</P>
      <P>When a big sporting event is about to be held, consumers usually buy more
electronic appliances that would allow them to receive the good quality game
broadcasts, he noted. Chang suggested that local display panel manufacturers,
one of the stronger sectors of Taiwan's ICT industry, should collaborate with
brand companies in China, which have the edge in terms of cost, to compete with
global brand names.</P>
      <P>Korean and Japanese companies together captured 51.12 percent of the China ICT
market, while Taiwan companies took only 34.36 percent, Chang said.</P>
      <P>As for Taiwan's mobile phone makers, the market focus should be upstream
production, in areas such as key components, another TRI analyst said.</P>
      <P>"The strength of the Taiwan companies lies in original equipment manufacturing
(OEM)," said Kevin Gao, a TRI researcher manager based in Shanghai.</P>
      <P>The demand in China for high-quality mobile phone accessories such as phone keys
and printed circuit boards (PCBs) will rise at a fast pace to match the
expanding telecommunication market, Kao said.</P>
      <P>According to the research unit's statistics, there are currently eight million
new cell phone subscriptions each month in China, an indication that the
country's mobile phone production output will surpass 100 million by 2011.</P>
      <P>Touching on the business outlook for notebook computers in China, Chang said
thanks to the low-price of the products, the market output is expected to reach
10.6 million in 2008.</P>
      <P>"Local notebook OEM vendors such as Quanta Computer and Inventec should be able
to secure business there," he added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Special Investigation Division under the Supreme Prosecutors Office said
Thursday that former President Chen Shui-bian will be summoned shortly for
questioning regarding the high-profile "state affairs fund" embezzlement case.</P>
      <P>A Special Investigation Division spokesman said the group was notified by the
Presidential Office earlier in the day that the office had declassified
documents allegedly implicating the former president, paving the way for the
task force to resume its probe.</P>
      <P>Chu Chao-liang said the Taipei District Court will summon Chen for questioning
shortly, probably at the Special Investigation Task Force headquarters, rather
than at Chen's office, his home or a third place.</P>
      <P>The declassification of documents will assist prosecutors in investigating
whether Chen was directly involved in the NT$14.8 million (US$450,000) "state
affairs fund" abuse case.</P>
      <P>The Taipei District Court obtained  the documents  from a prosecutorial team
that indicted Chen's wife and three of Chen's aides in November 2006 on charges
of corruption and forgery for allegedly misappropriating NT$14.8 million from
the "state affairs fund" --  a special allowance  set aside for the president's
discretionary use for official purposes.</P>
      <P>Chen was listed as a co-offender in the alleged embezzlement case after he left
office May 20, but investigations into his role in the case have made little
progress because he refused to make public several key documents on the grounds
of national security.</P>
      <P>Chen proclaimed the documents -- mainly receipts and records of Chen's use of
discretionary "state affairs funds" from 2000 through June 30, 2006 -- as
"strictly confidential" in September 2007 in accordance  with the Classified
National  Security Information Protection Act. That declaration stalled court
proceedings.</P>
      <P>The Special Investigation  Division asked President  Ma to declassify the files
shortly after he assumed office. Ma then formed a special team to scrutinize the
documents.</P>
      <P>After combing through the files,  the Presidential  Office declassified them
Wednesday, saying that making the documents public would not "endanger the
country's interests."</P>
      <P>Denouncing the declassification of Chen's files Thursday, Lee Sheng-chen, the
former president's lawyer, said Ma may have violated sedition laws by ordering
the declassification. He said he will file for the Council of Grand Justices  to
issue a Constitutional interpretation on special presidential powers.</P>
      <P>Presidential Office spokesman Wang Yu-chi on Thursday continued to defend the
decision to declassify the documents, saying that the move simply aimed to
"allow the truth to come out."</P>
      <P>"No political considerations or maneuvers were involved in the
declassification," Wang said.</P>
      <P>Wang said Ma would bear responsibility for the move, saying "every head of state
is obliged to shoulder the consequences and responsibilities for what he does
during his tenure as president."</P>
      <P>Chen has denied any wrongdoing in the case, insisting that the courts will
eventually clear his name.</P>

      <P>The Buddhist Tzu Chi Foundation will hold an event Friday night in front of
Taipei City Hall to promote the idea of replacing Taiwan's "ghost month" rituals
that are harmful to the environment with more earth-friendly practices, and to
pray for the well-being of all people.</P>
      <P>Supported by the Taipei city government's Department of Civil Affairs, the event
aims to increase local people's awareness that with global warming an
increasingly serious issue, the so-called ghost month -- the seventh month of
the year according to the lunar calendar -- should no longer be observed in the
traditional manner, which includes burning large volumes of "ghost money."</P>
      <P>Studies have shown that burning paper money releases benzene -- a carcinogen --
lead and other chemicals that pollutes the air and could potentially damage
human health.</P>
      <P>Dharma Master Cheng Yen, a Buddhist nun and founder of Tzu Chi, has called for
turning the ghost month into an "auspicious month" -- a time for people to be
grateful and be filial to their parents, to practice fasting or vegetarianism,
to benefit the world's masses with good deeds, and to refrain from burning ghost
money and preparing wasteful sacrificial offerings in order to protect the
earth.</P>
      <P>This year's ghost month runs from Aug. 1 through Aug. 30. According to legend,
the gates of the netherworld are open during this month to allow the ghosts to
feast in the land of the living.</P>
      <P>Many people in Taiwan will observe the time-honored tradition of offering
sacrifices and burning incense and ghost money in temples or in front of their
homes to appease the wandering spirits.</P>
      <P>The rituals usually climax on the 15th day of the lunar month, which falls on
Aug. 15 this year.</P>
      <P>The Tzu Chi Foundation called on people to donate the funds originally intended
for burning ghost money to charities and use flowers and fruit in lieu of animal
sacrifices for their worship rituals.</P>

four-day run at the Houli Horse Farm in Houli township.</P>
      <P>According to Taichung Magistrate Huang Jhong-sheng, this year's festival is

Aug. 7 and Father's Day on Aug. 8.</P>
      <P>He said the festival has lined up 100 saxophonists to play and 100 drummers to

festival, Huang said, adding that members of the public can bring their own
instruments and get up on stage during a series of free jams.</P>

      <P>Wu  Shuh-min,  chairman  of  the pro-independence group Taiwan Society, urged
the public Thursday to participate in a protest scheduled for Aug. 30 -- the
100th day after President Ma Ying-jeou took office -- to express their anger at
what he called Ma's misguided political and economic policies.</P>
      <P>Wu made the remarks at a press conference, where he was joined by former senior
presidential advisor Koo Kuang-ming, Taiwan Society Secretary-General Lo Chih-
cheng, Taiwan Guts Executive Director Freddy, and Huang Kun-hu, president of the
Taiwan Friends of President Lee Teng-hui Association.</P>
      <P>"The Aug. 30 protest aims to make the government understand the people's
thoughts, " Wu said. "I hope everyone can stand up and express their anger so
that the government will correct its wrong policies."</P>
      <P>He was referring to Ma's moves to improve cross-Taiwan Strait relations,
including easing restrictions on commercial exchanges and seeking a "diplomatic
truce" with China.</P>
      <P>"People are really worried because the government keeps tilting toward China,"
Wu said. "Where will Taiwan go in the future, with the government giving up its
sovereignty in the international arena and making concessions [to China] on
every occasion?"</P>
      <P>Koo said the name change of the state-run postal company was an example of the
Ma government's compromising on sensitive issues of sovereignty.</P>
      <P>The board of the state postal company decided on Aug. 1 to restore the company's
original name -- Chunghwa Post Co. -- more than a year after it was renamed
"Taiwan Post Co." by the former pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) administration.</P>
      <P>The company adopted the name "Taiwan Post Co." in February 2007 amid a DPP-
backed campaign to change the names of state-owned enterprises that contain
references to China. "Chunghwa" means "Chinese" or "China" in the Chinese
language.</P>
      <P>"What everybody fights for are the interests of the land, Taiwan, instead of for
a particular party or person, " Koo said. "Will the same thing have to occur all
over again if there's another transfer of power?"</P>
      <P>Lo said some might argue that the government should be given more time to
perform. However, he thought the issue was not how long Ma had been in power,
but rather his wrong-headed  move toward "de-Taiwanization" and embrace of
China.</P>
      <P>"The attitude of the government is so arrogant, and it will only get worse if
the people don't express their anger," he said.</P>
      <P>The Aug. 30 protest is being organized by eight pro-independence groups,
including Taiwan Society, Taiwan Guts, Taiwan Heart and the Taiwan Friends of
President Lee Teng-hui Association.</P>
      <P>Two groups of protesters will march separately from the business and shopping
area of Zhongxiao East Road, Section 3 and from Lungshan Temple before joining
up for a rally on Ketagalan Boulevard, in front of the Presidential Office.</P>

      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan said Thursday that the focus of his administration is
deregulation and development.</P>
      <P>The premier made the statement at a weekly meeting of the Executive Yuan as he
listened to Minister Without Portfolio Chu Yun-peng's report on "financial
deregulation and tax reforms."</P>
      <P>The premier asked all government agencies to get down to work based on a
national development blueprint drafted at a Cabinet seminar late last month,
which included the investment of NT$4 trillion (US$131.14 million) in major
development projects over four years.</P>
      <P>The government agencies will have some leeway in implementing the national
development projects by the end of next year, but their main task now is "to get
down to work," Liu said.</P>
      <P>He said that in order to upgrade Taiwan's international competitiveness, the
government has accelerated the pace of financial deregulation in the hope of
luring overseas capital and talents and rejuvenating the economy.</P>
      <P>Chu reported in the Cabinet meeting that the government is planning to amend the
law in 2009 to allow domestic banks to open branches in China and allow foreign
and Chinese investment in domestic banks.</P>
      <P>Chu also said that the deregulations and tax reforms are aimed at turning Taiwan
into an asset management and fund-raising center in the Asia-Pacific region.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, the premier also said that all other countries are facing
the problem of inflation, and Taiwan should not take the issue lightly.</P>
      <P>Amid media reports that the price of toothpaste, canned foods and laundry
detergents have risen by as much as 20 percent, Liu instructed the Fair Trade
Commission to pay attention to possible price gouging on basic goods.</P>
      <P>"The government will not allow unreasonable increases in consumer prices," he

    <TEXT>
      <P>Representatives of several women's rights groups urged Taiwanese fathers
Thursday to take a more visible role in child-rearing, a responsibility that
remains far heavier for mothers.</P>
      <P>Making the appeal on the eve of Father's Day, the representatives suggested that
the government take steps to encourage paternal involvement in child-rearing
such as designating a day of the year as "Father's and Children's Day" and
implementing as soon as possible a plan to offer a monthly subsidy to workers on
parental leave.</P>
      <P>They argued that these measures are essential to creating a women-friendly work
environment, enhancing the labor force participation of Taiwanese women and
boosting the country's declining birth rate.</P>
      <P>"Confined by traditional notions, the public generally believes the mother
should take the major role in taking care of children," observed Fang Yun,
chairwoman of the Awakening Foundation. "This has restricted women's career
development."</P>
      <P>Although the Gender Equality in Employment Law of 2002 allows either of the
parents to take unpaid parental leave for up to two years until their children
reach three years old, only 996 men covered by Labor Insurance have taken the
leave since the law's implementation. That accounts for just 4 percent of the
total of 23,823 insured workers who have been absent from work for child care
purposes.</P>
      <P>Between June 2007 and May 2008, a total of 1,768 civil servants took parental
leave, but only 92 -- or 5 percent -- were men, Fang said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, none of the 44 military personnel who took parental leave during the
same period were men, she pointed out.</P>
      <P>Citing data from the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics,
Fang said that more than 50 percent of women who were absent from the labor
force in 2006 did so for family reasons, compared with only 0.04 percent of men
weren't working for family reasons.</P>
      <P>Pointing to the example of Sweden, Su Chien-ling, a supervisor of the Taiwan
Gender Equity Education Association, noted that the participation rate of men
was only 4 percent when Sweden first introduced parental leave in 1974.</P>
      <P>However, that rate rose to 45 percent after the Swedish government in 1995
required that at least one out of the 18 months be used by the father, and then
in 2002 extended that mandatory time to two months, Su said.</P>

      <P>A total of 1,829 college seniors will win a chance to take courses specially
designed for meeting industry needs before graduation, an official of the
Industrial Development Bureau said Thursday.</P>
      <P>According to Chen Tie-yuan, a section chief of the bureau, 98 courses will be
provided by various college departments in the new academic year in four
traditional  industry fields:  precision machinery, surface treatment, die
casting and textiles.</P>
      <P>Designed under a national program to narrow the gap between academic learning
and workplace practice, each course was crafted based on special characteristics
of regional industry sectors.</P>
      <P>Designing these courses allowed schools to update their teaching to cover
knowledge of newly emerged industry sub sectors and to raise students' skills
and competitiveness, Chen said.</P>
      <P>College seniors who have taken three professional courses with scores averaging
higher than 70 are eligible for the course, which will familiarize them with
workplace challenges and inspire them in their future career choices, Chen said.</P>
      <P>The government will provide subsidies totalling NT$97.86 million (US$3.16

qualified students, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Each student will receive scholarships ranging in amount from NT$30,000 to
NT$50,000 in one year, Chen said. He added that the scholarship aims to
encourage qualified students to step into new fields to benefit themselves,
schools and industry.</P>
      <P>Chen said the plan started last year and was welcomed by students and colleges,
especially those in the fields of science and technology. The bureau will carry

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan records first trade deficit in 28 months: Finance Ministry</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug 7 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's external trade recorded a deficit of US$410 million (NT$12.65 billion)
in July, the first for 28 months, as a result of soaring international  prices
of oil and raw commodities, a Ministry of Finance (MOF) official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>"July's import values of mineral products, including crude oil, and steel goods
rose 55.7 percent and 61.4 percent year-on-year, respectively, " said Lin Lee-
jen, statistics director under the ministry, at a news conference.</P>
      <P>According to the MOF, July's average prices of crude oil reached US$126.75 per
barrel, a rise of 87.9 percent year-on-year. Despite the volume of oil imported
in July being 10.7 percent less than the same period of last year, the import
value still rose by an annualized 68.7 percent to reach US$3.38 billion.</P>
      <P>The export value for July rose by 8 percent year-on-year at US$22.87 billion,
the fifth highest figure in Taiwan's history. But imports rose at a higher
annualized rate of 12.3 percent, with the value standing at US$23.28 billion,
the second-highest on record.</P>
      <P>"The export value of electric machines and textile products were reduced by 17.2
percent and 10.5 percent, respectively, " said Lee, adding that this was another
factor leading to the trade deficit.</P>
      <P>Lin said the monthly trade deficit is the third since January 1999, as two
separate deficits of US$610 million and US$510 million were recorded in February
2006 and December 2004, respectively.</P>
      <P>Trade between January and July still marked a surplus of US$7.58 billion,  but
was down by US$3.45 billion compared  with the year-earlier figure.</P>
      <P>Exports to China, which is the country's largest trading partner in terms of
both exports and imports, only increased by 4 percent to US$8.94 billion, the
lowest growth since June 2005.</P>
      <P>Attributing the decline to the battered outlook among major consumer markets
around the world, Lin said exports to the United States, the nation's second-
largest trading partner, also dropped considerably by 6.1 percent to US$2.75
billion.</P>
      <P>Asked if the trade deficit will continue in the coming months, the official
responded positively, saying that with a drop in crude oil prices in recent
weeks, external trade statistics could soon show a surplus.</P>
      <P>International oil prices fell by 16 percent over the past month, from US$138.91
per barrel July 7 to US$116.110 per barrel Aug. 7.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's export to the emerging economies continued to grow steadily, as the
value of goods shipped to the six larger economies in the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations -- Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore,
Thailand and Vietnam -- were 21.2 percent higher than same month of last year,
reaching US$3.5 billion.</P>

      <P>Eight cities and counties in northern Taiwan have decided to collectively
promote their speciality products in a bid to build a strong impression among
the public and entice potential visitors, specifically Chinese tourists.</P>
      <P>Yang Ching-yen,  director  of the Taipei  County  Economic Development Bureau,
said that in an effort to attract more Chinese tourist dollars, eight local
governments -- Taipei County, Taipei City, Taoyuan County, Yilan County, Hsinchu
City, Hsinchu County, Keelung City and Miaoli County -- have decided to make a
joint effort to promote their speciality foods and other items.</P>
      <P>Under the program, the eight local governments agree to showcase their specialty
goods collectively at an exhibition center in each of the eight administrative
areas, Yang explained.</P>
      <P>Wherever visitors go in the eight cities and counties, they will be able to find
speciality products from every area at each local exhibition center, such as
pineapple cakes from Taipei City, Baochung tea from Taipei County, dry bean curd
from Taoyuan County and fresh strawberries from Miaoli County, he said.</P>
      <P>The results of several recent opinion surveys show that some 70 percent of the
Chinese tourists who visited Taiwan last month support the idea of establishing
a pineapple cake museum in Taipei City, while 31 percent picked up pineapple
cakes as their preferred gift items.</P>
      <P>Baochung tea from Taipei County has long been very popular among the diversified
categories of tea produced in different areas of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Taipei Magistrate Chou Hsi-wei has on several occasions treated Chinese and
other foreign dignitaries to Baochung tea, which has won several prizes in tea
and cuisine competitions in Beijing.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou will attend a bazaar Friday along with seven other local
chiefs to help sell speciality products from each of the eight cities and
counties.</P>
      <P>Based on a deal inked in June between Taipei and Beijing, Ma instituted  a wider
opening to Chinese  tourists  and weekend cross-Taiwan Strait in early July in
the hope of injecting momentum to Taiwan's economy.</P>
      <P>The eight local governments have also jointly organized a series of activities
to attract public attention to their typical farm produce or special goods in
line with their efforts to promote local tourism, with three fairs to be held
across northern regions -- one in Yilan County Aug. 16, one in Banciao, Taipei
County Oct. 4, and one in Hsinchu County Nov. 8, Yang said.</P>
      <P>Visitors to these exhibitions will be able to have a taste of the eight
localities' speciality foods or see their other unique items all in one place,
he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>New strains of Hepatitis C virus found in Taiwan: researchers</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  7 (CNA)
08/07/08  20:40:18
(By Zep Hu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>E-Da Hospital in Kaohsiung has recently found three strains of hepatitis C virus
that had never been seen before in Taiwan, which presents a possible threat to
Taiwan's public health system, medical researchers at the hospital said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Lin Hsi-hsun, chief of E-Da's infectious diseases section, said that to date,
there are only three strains of hepatitis C virus endemic to Taiwan -- strains
1b, 2a, and 2b.</P>
      <P>"These three strains are well-known to local physicians, and effective
treatments have long been developed, " said Lin. "However, the three new strains
of 1a, 6a, and 3a are relatively foreign to us, and we may need some time to
develop or adopt viable treatments."</P>
      <P>During the medical examinations of 243 drug addicts who had been in prison
between 2004 and 2006, the 1a, 6a, and 3a strains were found in their blood
samples, said Lin.</P>
      <P>Among the prisoners, 29.2 percent carried the 1a strain, 23.5 percent had the 6a
strain, and 20.2 percent were infected with the 3a strain.</P>
      <P>According to national health statistics, 96.6 percent of Taiwan's drug addicts
have developed hepatitis C, with most of them having been infected by sharing
syringes with carriers of the disease.</P>
      <P>Based on the evidence collected in experiments, the researchers, led by Lin,
reached a hypothesis that the strains may have been imported from China and
Southeast Asia.</P>
      <P>"One of the suggestions is that some of the drug addicts visited these areas and
shared syringes with addicts there, then returned to Taiwan carrying the
Hepatitis virus," said Lin.</P>
      <P>Lin noted that although only a few cases of the 3a strain have been found in the
general population so far, Taiwan's public health might face challenges if the
foreign strain spreads.</P>
      <P>Based on the treatments developed in other countries, Lin said, it is relatively
easier to contain the 6a and 3a strains, but it is more difficult to treat the
1a strain infection, as it usually takes at least one year to contain such an
infection.</P>

      <P>Thirty "mystery" juries are now tasting beef noodles around the city as a warmup
to the upcoming 2008 Taipei Beef Noodle Festival, the sponsor of the event said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>The Taipei city government's Department of Economic Development said the juries,
comprised of six gourmets and 24 reporters specializing in food, are tasting the
offerings of 120 beef noodle shops around the city.</P>
      <P>The 120 shops have been recommended by borough chiefs and taxi drivers -- who
are said by some to have a reputation of being familiar with local delicacies --
with each administrative district allowed to name 10 shops.</P>
      <P>The juries will select five shops from each administrative district, or 60 shops
in all, by Aug. 18, the officials said.</P>
      <P>The 60 shops will then be posted on the festival's Web site at http:
//2008tbnf.com.tw to serve as reference for those who are interested in finding
good beef noodles.</P>
      <P>The selection will be based on flavor, cleanliness, appearance, service quality
and price. If the performance in each of the five categories is of high
standard, the shop will be given one star for each.</P>
      <P>The city government will present trophies to those shops that collect four or
five stars.</P>
      <P>The public will be invited to choose their favorite beef noodles starting Sept.
1 and the most popular beef noodle shops will be unveiled Oct. 31.</P>
      <P>There will also be an individual competition, with the winner crowned the "beef

    <HEADLINE>Indigenous tribe seeks to rekindle hunting tradition</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A group Rukai tribal men gathered in southern Pingtung County Thursday for a
ritual to mark the imminent start of the Rukai traditional hunting season -- a
tradition that has been substantially restricted since stricter wildlife
conservation laws were legislated in the late 1980s.</P>
      <P>More than 100 Rukai from Pingtung County and the neighboring southern county of
Kaohsiung and eastern county of Taitung fired their rifles into the air to
notify the gods of the Aug. 15 launch of the hunting season.</P>
      <P>Addressing the ritual, Yen Chin-cheng, chief of the Wutai rural township in
Pingtung County, lamented that hunting has gradually faded out among the Rukai
people since the Wildlife Conservation Act was promulgated, creating growing
public awareness of the need for wildlife conservation and protection.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the act, indigenous people are allowed to hunt for only two
weeks every year, which has meant that most of the former Rukai hunters have
been forced to leave their homes to seek menial work in the cities, Yen said.</P>
      <P>Yen noted that the Rukai hunters used to hunting over a vast area that stretched
from Wutai to the distant Taimali river area in the eastern county of Taitung.
The Rukai used to be great hunters of Formosan bears, Formosan sambars, wild
boar, goats and Formosan Reeve's muntjacs, he noted.</P>
      <P>"The hunting provided an important source of protein for the Rukai people and
formed one of the signature traditions of the tribe," Yen said.</P>
      <P>"A hunter who killed five male wild boar would be decorated by the chieftain
with wreaths made of lilies and would be considered a hero," Yen added.</P>
      <P>The glorious citation is now history, he lamented, adding that the central
government is risking leading the ancient craft to extinction if they continue
to be reluctant to do anything to save the dying tradition.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  the Rukai also declared  in the ritual  their sovereignty claim over
their traditional land.</P>
      <P>At the end of the ceremony, they called for the central government to return
them their traditional rights to hunt in their traditional hunting grounds.</P>
      <P>They urged the Forestry  Department  under the Council of Agriculture (COA) to
talk with the Rukai to allow the two parties to co-manage the reserve areas and
forests in their traditional land, which has been taken from them by the
government and is now administered by the COA.</P>
      <P>They also called for the legislature to amend articles in the Wildlife
Conservation Act that run counter to the culture and spirit of the indigenous
people.</P>
      <P>They further demanded that the administration allocate part of the Employment
Stabilization Fund to finance the employment of Rukai people in jobs pertaining
to wildlife conservation and environmental protection.</P>
      <P>The Rukai, whose population totals around 11,000, is one of the 14 indigenous
groups that the administration officially recognizes at present.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's indigenous people -- the native groups that predate all other people
Taiwan -- originated in southern China according to some anthropologists,
although most agree that they came from the vast Austronesian-language region.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's major shopping Web sites showed double-digit growth in sales revenues
during the first six months of this year amid rising inflation and soaring oil
prices, Web site executives said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Buying goods online saves on travel costs, the executives said, adding that as
oil prices rose during the first half of this year, many locals began turning to
local shopping Web sites.</P>
      <P>In addition, shopping Web sites offer a wide range of price or product choices
and promotional incentives, which is another big advantage in attracting local
customers, they observed.</P>
      <P>"Online shopping has become a new way of life in today's society," said Charlene
Hung, general manager of Yahoo! Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"Either home delivery or picking up goods ordered online at convenience stores
is quite convenient," she went on.</P>
      <P>Hung said that Yahoo! Taiwan's shopping Web site, like many other similar ones
in the United States, has posted a double-digit rise in online sales revenues.</P>
      <P>Local food specialties are the most popular items on Yahoo! Taiwan, according to
Hung.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the Taipei-based Far Eastern Group's GOHAPPY Web site -- which was
launched June 15, 2007 -- enjoyed double-digit growth during the first half of
the year compared with the second half of last year.</P>
      <P>GOHAPPY's revenues also increased 20 percent every month during the first six
months of this year, said Susan Chiu, marketing assistant manager of Ding Ding
Integrated Marketing Service Co., which is in charge of GOHAPPY.</P>
      <P>In July alone, the Web site's revenues jumped 43 percent compared with the
average monthly revenues of the first six months, Chiu noted.</P>
      <P>Best-selling products are home products, entertainment electronic products and
computer products, Chiu went on, adding that GOHAPPY mainly sells products of
the group's Pacific SOGO department stores and its hypermarket chain, Far
Eastern Geant.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Takkyubin, an express delivery service company owned by President
Chain Store Corp., Taiwan's largest convenience store operator with more than
4,800 7-Eleven stores, also benefited from the booming online sales.</P>
      <P>Takkyubin said that during the first six months of this year, its online
delivery service increased 30 percent in terms of revenue from a year ago.</P>
      <P>Most of the delivered goods were food specialties, computer, communication, and

      <P>Nearly 32 percent of Taiwanese men are not interested in having children,
according to the results of a survey released by an online human resources firm
Thursday, the eve of Father's Day.</P>
      <P>The survey, conducted by www.1111.com.tw, found that among the childless men,
including married and single people, 31.74 percent said they are not keen on
having children or do not want children at all.</P>
      <P>The reason most cited for not wanting children is that they cannot afford to
have children at 57.43 percent, followed by "not wanting to be bogged down by an
extra burden" at 34.65 percent, and "no confidence in the educational
environment" at 31.68 percent in the multiple choice survey..</P>
      <P>On parent-child relations, the survey found that 20.19 percent of fathers polled
have never said "I love you" to their children, while 18.75 percent forgot when
they last said the words.</P>
      <P>This shows that nearly 40 percent of the fathers are not good at expressing
their feelings.</P>
      <P>However, 18.27 percent of the fathers polled said they say "I love you" to their
children every day.</P>
      <P>The survey also found that 23.9 percent of Taiwanese men "want very much to help
with household chores" and that only 3.82 percent are unwilling to help with
such chores as garbage collection and categorizing, sweeping, washing the dishes
and laundry.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted between July 22 and Aug. 4 with 523 effective samples

      <P>The number of South Korean tourists visiting Taiwan in the first half of this
year grew by a whopping 32.7 percent year-on-year, the Ministry of
Transportation and Communications (MOTC) reported Thursday.</P>
      <P>The numbers of tourists from Macau and Hong Kong also grew by 29 percent in the
same period, according to the Tourism Bureau under the MOTC.</P>
      <P>The number of Japanese tourists, however, declined by 5 percent, mainly as a
result of the sagging Japanese economy, bureau officials added.</P>
      <P>Save for the Japanese, almost all sources of tourists from abroad soared in the
first six months of this year, climbing by an average of 10.5 percent, with that
from South Korea growing the fastest, the officials said.</P>
      <P>They attributed the remarkable increase in the number of Korean tourists to
Taiwan to various promotion programs that the Tourism Bureau has launched over
the past year -- programs including the production and broadcasting in Korea of
a Korean soap opera series called On Air, part of which was filmed in Taiwan
under the auspices of the Tourism Bureau.</P>
      <P>"The showing of On Air in South Korea has not only let Korean citizens know
about Jiufen and Sun Moon Lake, as well as Taipei and Hualien, it has also
attracted more Korean tourists, " a Tourism Bureau official said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Tourism Bureau said that the occupancy rate of Taiwan's tourist
hotels totaled just 63.7 percent in the first half of 2008, representing a
decline of 2.2 percent year-on-year.</P>
      <P>Average room rates for tourist hotels, however, increased by 0.8 percent during
the same period.</P>
      <P>Tourism Bureau officials envisioned that the number of tourists visiting Taiwan
is expected to grow substantially in the second half of the year, thanks to the
July 4 opening to tourists from China.</P>

Governing Visiting, Residence and Permanent Residence of Aliens, which entered
into force Aug. 1.</P>
      <P>The amended regulations apply to those married to Taipei-based Tibetans prior to
Jan. 26, 2007 and who are allowed to enter Taiwan with travel documents issued
by the Indian government, the statement read.</P>
      <P>The regulations also cover Tibetans' children under the age of 20 with the same
documents, according to the statement.</P>
      <P>One hundred and twenty-five Tibetans were allowed to stay in Taiwan after the
government launched an investigation to confirm their identities in 2001, the
statement went on.</P>
      <P>Their spouses, nevertheless, could only stay in Taiwan for 180 days at a time,
the statement said, adding that they then had to leave Taiwan and file a new
application.</P>
      <P>The immigration agency urged qualified Tibetan spouses and children to take
their Indian travel documents, proof of no criminal record and health check
documents and apply for residency in Taiwan at the agency's branch offices
around the country.</P>

      <P>Lobbyists  must register with the institutions of whoever they want to lobby,
providing information such as the content of the lobbying and how much is to be
spent on the lobbying under a new law, the Ministry of the Interior (MOI) said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>MOI officials said that after the Lobby Law is put into effect the following
day, Taiwan will become only the third country after the United States and
Canada to regulate lobbying activities.</P>
      <P>Ministry officials said that full disclosure of information will be required and
that those who violate the regulations will face fines of up to NT$2.5 million
(US$81,967).</P>
      <P>The officials said that under the law, those who can be lobbied include the
president, the vice president, elected officials at various levels, chiefs and
deputies of city and county governments and village, township and city offices,
as well as those who are covered by the Statute Governing the Retirement and
Consolation Payment to Political Appointee.</P>
      <P>The total number in all categories is over 5,800. At the same time, 740 of their
governing agencies will also be covered by the new law.</P>
      <P>The law defines a lobbyist as one who attempts to influence the formation,
formulation, revision or abrogation of a law, a policy, or a bill by directly
expressing views to the one being lobbied or his proxies.</P>
      <P>The officials said that foreign governments and institutional organizations have
to commission local people to lobby on their behalf and that they should not
lobby over matters concerning national defense, diplomacy or China affairs
involving national security or national secrets.</P>
      <P>Individuals, institutional organizations or groups from China, Macau or Hong
Kong will not be allowed to engage in lobbying, according to the law.</P>
      <P>To avoid conflict of interest, the officials said public office holders, apart
from elected officials, cannot lobby the offices in which they have served in
the past five years within three years of leaving office.</P>
      <P>Elected officials at various levels should also not lobby for businesses run by
themselves or their relatives or in which they own a stake of over 10 percent.</P>
      <P>Those who violate the regulations regarding avoidance of conflict of interest
will risk fines of between NT$500,000 and NT$2.5 million under the new law.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The number of South Korean tourists visiting Taiwan in the first half of this
year grew by a whopping 32.7 percent year-on-year, the Ministry of
Transportation and Communications (MOTC) reported Thursday.</P>
      <P>The numbers of tourists from Macau and Hong Kong also grew by 29 percent in the
same period, according to the Tourism Bureau under the MOTC.</P>
      <P>The number of Japanese tourists, however, declined by 5 percent, mainly as a
result of the sagging Japanese economy, bureau officials added.</P>
      <P>Save for the Japanese, almost all sources of tourists from abroad soared in the
first six months of this year, climbing by an average of 10.5 percent, with that
from South Korea growing the fastest, the officials said.</P>
      <P>They attributed the remarkable increase in the number of Korean tourists to
Taiwan to various promotion programs that the Tourism Bureau has launched over
the past year -- programs including the production and broadcasting in Korea of
a Korean soap opera series called On Air, part of which was filmed in Taiwan
under the auspices of the Tourism Bureau.</P>
      <P>"The showing of On Air in South Korea has not only let Korean citizens know
about Jiufen and Sun Moon Lake, as well as Taipei and Hualien, it has also
attracted more Korean tourists, " a Tourism Bureau official said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Tourism Bureau said that the occupancy rate of Taiwan's tourist
hotels totaled just 63.7 percent in the first half of 2008, representing a
decline of 2.2 percent year-on-year.</P>
      <P>Average room rates for tourist hotels, however, increased by 0.8 percent during
the same period.</P>
      <P>Tourism Bureau officials envisioned that the number of tourists visiting Taiwan
is expected to grow substantially in the second half of the year, thanks to the
July 4 opening to tourists from China.</P>

      <P>Nearly 32 percent of Taiwanese men are not interested in having children,
according to the results of a survey released by an online human resources firm
Thursday, the eve of Father's Day.</P>
      <P>The survey, conducted by www.1111.com.tw, found that among the childless men,
including married and single people, 31.74 percent said they are not keen on
having children or do not want children at all.</P>
      <P>The reason most cited for not wanting children is that they cannot afford to
have children at 57.43 percent, followed by "not wanting to be bogged down by an
extra burden" at 34.65 percent, and "no confidence in the educational
environment" at 31.68 percent in the multiple choice survey..</P>
      <P>On parent-child relations, the survey found that 20.19 percent of fathers polled
have never said "I love you" to their children, while 18.75 percent forgot when
they last said the words.</P>
      <P>This shows that nearly 40 percent of the fathers are not good at expressing
their feelings.</P>
      <P>However, 18.27 percent of the fathers polled said they say "I love you" to their
children every day.</P>
      <P>The survey also found that 23.9 percent of Taiwanese men "want very much to help
with household chores" and that only 3.82 percent are unwilling to help with
such chores as garbage collection and categorizing, sweeping, washing the dishes
and laundry.</P>

      <P>The Republic of China has donated US$2.5 million to Honduras to fund development
projects in the Central American ally, ROC Ambassador to Honduras Lai Chien-
chung told CNA by phone Thursday.</P>
      <P>Lai said in Tegucigalpa, the capital of Honduras, that the donation will be used
to establish electricity supply systems, promote public health education, boost
local production and improve tap water sanitation and drainage systems in the
country's rural areas.</P>
      <P>Lai added that the donation is part of Taiwan's bilateral cooperation program.</P>

      <P>Several  pro-Tibet  non-government organizations held a peaceful march Friday in
Taipei on the opening day of the Beijing Olympics, urging the world not to
forget about what they described as the atrocities committed by the Chinese
government.</P>
      <P>Members of the Regional Tibetan Youth Congress Taiwan, Friends of Tibet in
Taiwan, the Taiwan Association of Human Rights, the Taiwan Youth for Democracy
in Asia and Taiwan Guts marched from the 228 Peace Park to the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>"Today our Chinese brothers and sisters might be joyfully celebrating the
opening of the great Olympics in which people unite and compete in one
brotherhood, but we should not forget those who have stood against the
tyrannical rule of the communist iron-fisted rulers of China, " said Tashi
Tsering, president of the Regional Tibetan Youth Congress Taiwan, before the
parade.</P>
      <P>Tashi was arrested in Japan April 26 for attempting to disrupt the Olympic torch
relay in Nagano and was released May 16 after paying a fine of 500,000 Japanese
yen (US$4,899).</P>
      <P>The 42-year-old Tibetan activist stated that despite the Beijing Olympics
opening later that evening, human rights abuses have been increasing in recent
weeks in Tibet and in China.</P>
      <P>"The situation has become worse as the Games approach, which is completely
against Beijing's promise to improve its human rights, " said Tashi.</P>
      <P>"We urge all the countries and human rights organizations around the world in
particular to press the government of China to immediately halt all repression
and to respect the fundamental human rights and religious freedom of Tibetan
people in Tibet," he added.</P>
      <P>Chou Mei-li, president of the Friends of Tibet in Taiwan, said the group
condemns Beijing for accusing human rights organizations and individuals
concerned about the human rights situation in Tibet and China of politicizing
the Olympics.</P>
      <P>"It is Beijing that is politicizing the games," she said. "If Taiwan does not
stand up for Tibet today, it will become the next Tibet," she predicted.</P>
      <P>She said it is shameful that Taiwan accepted the procession arrangement of its
Olympic team at the opening ceremony, claiming that it completely belittles
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The procession of the Beijing Olympic opening ceremony has been arranged
according to the number of strokes contained in the first characters of their
country names in simplified Chinese characters.</P>
      <P>Under the system, Taiwan will be the 24th team to enter the stadium after Japan
and before the Central African Republic and Hong Kong, a model that is different
from past precedent, in which Taiwan was grouped under the "T" section based on
a protocol signed in 1981.</P>
      <P>Although the new system will not result in Taiwan being grouped together with
China in the opening procession,  activists are concerned that if this new
precedent is set, Taiwan will be grouped together with China and Hong Kong when
taking part in future Olympic Games and other international sports events.</P>

      <P>Nine members of the U.S. House of Representatives are heading a delegation that
is scheduled to arrive in Taiwan aboard a special military flight this weekend
for a three-day visit, a Taiwan official posted in the United States said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>The group, organized by the House Committee on Transportation and
Infrastructure, will be the largest to visit Taiwan since 2003, indicating the
importance attached by the U.S. Congress toward the Republic of China and its
new government, said Lai Shui-chih, deputy chief of the Press Division under the
Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office in the United States (TECRO).</P>
      <P>During  its stay in Taiwan,  the delegation  will make a fact-finding tour of
Evergreen Aviation Technologies Corp., which maintains and services aircraft
owned by the U.S. international carrier Delta Air Lines.</P>
      <P>According to Lai, trade unions in the U.S. aerospace industry have recently
expressed concern over a situation in which American airline  companies  are
sending  their aircraft  overseas  for maintenance, which has resulted in job
losses in the United States.</P>
      <P>The tour will help the congressmen get a clearer picture of the issue before
reacting to the trade unions, Lai said.</P>
      <P>The delegation will also take a ride on the Taiwan high speed railway and will
pass Taiwan's high speed rail experience on to the U.S. government for its
reference, according to an itinerary released by the TECRO.</P>
      <P>The congressmen will meet with President Ma Ying-jeou, Premier Liu Chao-shiuan,
Minister of Foreign Affairs Francisco H.L. Ou and Minister of Transportation and
Communications Mao Chi-kuo. They will also visit the National Palace Museum and
the Taipei 101 skyscraper before leaving Taiwan Monday.</P>
      <P>The delegation is led by Jerry Costello (D-Ill.), chairman of the Subcommittee
on Aviation, with members also including John Duncan (R-Tenn.), Solomon Ortiz
(D-Texas), Tim Holden (D-Pa.), Eddie Bernice Johnson (D-Texas), Michael Capuano
(D-Mass.), Henry Brown (R-S.C.), Dan Lipinski (D-Ill.) and Mary Fallin

      <P>Taroko Gorge National Park in eastern Taiwan saw the highest number of visitors
among all of Taiwan's national parks in the first half of this year, according
to the latest Interior Ministry tallies released Friday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's seven national parks received a total of 8.21 million visitors in the
January-June period, with Taroko Gorge accounting for 2.53 million, the ministry
said.</P>
      <P>The number of visitors to Taroko National Park, which spans the eastern counties
of Hualien, Taichung and Nantou, marked an increase of more than 240,000 over
the level for the same period of a year ago.</P>
      <P>Second on the list was Yangmingshan National Park -- Taiwan's smallest national
park -- which is located in the mountainous suburbs of Taipei and received 2.48
million visitors for the January-June period.</P>
      <P>The figure marked a decline of more than 700,000 over the previous year's level,
largely due to a lengthy cold spell during the park's famous flower festival
during February and March, which kept many visitors away, the ministry said.</P>
      <P>Kending National Park, the oldest and southernmost national park, received the
third-highest number of visitors for the period at 1.48 million. The figure was
also down over the previous year because of the cold spell in February and March
as well as a lengthy period of torrential rain in June, according to the
ministry.</P>
      <P>Since the government passed the National Park Act in 1972 to protect the
environment, wildlife and history in its territory, seven national parks have
been established around the island.</P>
      <P>Dongsha Marine National Park in the South China Sea is the latest and largest of
the parks, covering a total area of nearly 3,540 square kilometers, which is
more than that of all the other parks combined and roughly ten percent of the
size of the whole of Taiwan proper.</P>
      <P>As the main purpose of the Dongsha marine park is ecological conservation, the
park is not open to visitors.</P>

      <P>The college admission rate reached a record high of 97.1 percent this year, with
the exam score required for university entrance hitting a new low of 7.69 points
in the country's history of entrance exams, an academic source said Friday.</P>
      <P>A total of 81,409 high school graduates out of the 90,894 students who took the
battery college entrance tests this year were admitted, marking a record high
97.1 percent success rate, according to the Joint Board of College Recruitment
Commission (JBCRC).</P>
      <P>With the record high number of applicants succeeding in landing a school, even
students with scores as low as 7.69 (1-600) will be accepted into Leader
University, a new facility located in Tainan City, southern Taiwan, according to
the JBCRC.</P>
      <P>Toko University in Taipei City suffered a low recruitment rate of lower than 10
percent, with 12 of its 18 departments open to freshman students receiving fewer
than 10 new students.</P>
      <P>For the annual joint college recruitment, 46 students filed for only one
department in one school to study. Twenty-four of them succeeded in landing in
their dream departments. The students are entitled to name up to 100 choices
among departments in 164 colleges and universities nationwide.</P>
      <P>The JBCRC authorities said Friday that board members will meet in October to
discuss whether it is necessary to impose threshold scores for applicants, as
allowing entry to low scores like 7.69 makes little sense in terms of entrance
exams. The problems pertaining to the existence crisis of new private
institutions should also be tackled in the face of ever-declining recruitment
rates, they said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a student aged 62 was admitted Friday as the oldest freshman this
year. He will study at the Hsing Kuo University of Management located in the
southern city of Tainan.</P>
      <P>A student aged 16 was admitted into the Department of Business Administration

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taipei city government invited its former education department heads to a
roundtable meeting Thursday, at which some of them raised hotly debated issues
concerning Taiwan's national identity and educational reforms.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the meeting organized  by the northern city's Department of
Education, Lin Chao-hsien, one of the nine former municipal education heads,
claimed that there is a lack of strong national identity among local students.</P>
      <P>This, he claimed, has caused confusion over whether the country should be
referred to as Republic of China, China, Taiwan, or Chinese Taipei.</P>
      <P>He also lashed out at teachers, claiming that they "fail to teach students to be
patriotic."</P>
      <P>He further accused the government education policy of having placed too much
emphasis on localization and globalization in recent years,  making  national
consciousness  and national  identity "disappear."</P>
      <P>Lin said national identity education might not produce obvious results in the
short term, but described it as having a long-term influence on the country's
future.</P>
      <P>The national identity topic has often been at issue in Taiwan in recent years,
with those -- including the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) -- that favor closer ties
with China preferring the country's national title, the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>They reject using the name Taiwan on the grounds that such a move might
highlight formal Taiwan independence. China claims sovereignty over self-ruled
Taiwan and vows war if it moves toward formal independence.</P>
      <P>However, others, including opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), prefer
using the name Taiwan.</P>
      <P>When it governed Taiwan between 2000 and 2008, the DPP launched Taiwan-centric
policies, which often drew harsh criticism from KMT supporters.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese identity activists deem the KMT, which came to Taiwan after losing a
civil war to the communists in China, as a "foreign regime" and have been
pushing for "normalizing" Taiwan as a sovereign country.</P>
      <P>Another issue raised at the meeting was Taiwan's decade-long educational
reforms.</P>
      <P>Huang Kun-huei, another former education head, said that the number of Taiwan's
senior high schools and universities has increased rapidly over the years,
resulting in supply exceeding demand.</P>
      <P>He claimed that today, students can still attend universities, "even if they
score zero" on the university entrance exam.</P>
      <P>In addition, the excessive numbers of universities and colleges have prompted
more young people to study at universities rather than at vocational schools, he
observed.</P>
      <P>Huang urged the education authorities  not to give up on vocational education.</P>
      <P>Lin said Taiwan's educational reforms should not be led by private groups, which
he attributed to the failure of the educational reforms.</P>
      <P>He accused these private groups of having no experience or professionalism and
of failing to put their slogans into practice.</P>
      <P>Although many have blamed the large numbers of universities for downgrading the
quality of today's students, critics have argued that grades should not
determine a student's future.</P>
      <P>Moreover, in many cases, senior high school courses have nothing to do with
university courses, the critics went on, noting that many who perform poorly in
high school can do well at university and have successful careers.</P>
      <P>Instead, they lambasted universities for not improving the quality of their
courses, which they claimed discourages students from learning and developing
professional skills.</P>
      <P>The critics also said that rising university admission rates in recent years
have been predictable, as Taiwan's birth rate has been dropping over the years.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's birth rate is now one of the world's lowest, and its university
admission rate hit an astonishing 97.1 percent this year.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>To enhance the quality of Taiwan's tourism and to cope with the influx of
Chinese tourists, the Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) Friday launched a
comprehensive NT$150 million two-year training project for workers in the
sector.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's natural beauty attracts millions of foreign tourists every year, but to
earn their loyalty, Taiwan needs to raise service quality in the industry,  said
CLA Minister Wang Ju-hsuan in announcing the new initiative at a press
conference Friday.</P>
      <P>"I seldom travel abroad now, since I've found that Taiwan's scenery is not
inferior to that in other countries. But the service attitude in Taiwan
sometimes makes travelers uncomfortable, " she said.</P>
      <P>Wang said NT$50 million will be allocated to the project this year and another
NT$100 million in 2009 to help local authorities train tourist guides,
receptionists, drivers and waiters at hotels and restaurants.</P>
      <P>Under the project, the government will subsidize local employment and vocational
training offices to train people already at work or those who wish to work in
the tourism sector.</P>
      <P>Chinese spouses holding a work permit or foreign spouses with a residency permit
are also eligible for the program.</P>
      <P>The CLA expects to train as many as 8,000 tourism workers per year.</P>
      <P>The project  is being launched  in coordination  with the government's efforts
to boost the number of Chinese tourists visiting Taiwan, the council said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan signed an agreement with China in June to allow 3,000 Chinese tourists
visit Taiwan per day, but to date, tourist arrivals from across the Taiwan
Strait have been far lower than the cap, barely averaging in the hundreds.</P>
      <P>Tourism Bureau Director-General Janice Seh-jen Lai said, however, the training
program is a national campaign that would improve the experience of all
travelers to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"The official slogan of Taiwan's tourism is 'Taiwan Touch Your Heart, ' and what
touches travelers' hearts are those who have direct contact with them, " Lai
said.</P>
      <P>Saying that Taiwan received 3.72 million tourists last year, Lai expected the
number could be increased to 4 million this year and create an output of NT$400
billion.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan launched a four-year, NT$20 billion project in June to
further develop important scenic spots islandwide and build a better environment
for tourists.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei residents have curbed their car use for short trips in recent months amid
soaring fuel prices, according to a survey released Friday by the city
government's Department of Transportation.</P>
      <P>Since May, when the central government began raising fuel prices, more that one-
third of respondents who previously drove cars for short trips switched to other
modes of transportation, the survey showed.</P>
      <P>Of those who stopped driving cars for short trips, most (80%) switched to using
scooters instead, according to the survey conducted by a local consultancy on
behalf of the city government.</P>
      <P>Before the fuel price hikes began in May, 35.2 percent of total respondents used
private cars for short trips. In July, that figure dropped to 23.1 percent.</P>
      <P>The department said that if fuel prices increase by another 10 percent, the
ratio of residents using private cars for short trips will likely drop below 20
percent, and fall as low as 16.4 percent if prices rise by 30 percent.</P>
      <P>During the May to July period, the ratio of Taipei residents using bicycles for
short trips outside the home rose from 6 percent to 10.5 percent, with the
figure expected to rise to 16.5 percent if fuel prices increase by another 30
percent, the survey showed.</P>
      <P>In the same period, the ratio of residents opting for public transportation for
short trips rose from 10.1 percent to 15 percent.</P>
      <P>The survey also showed that only 10.8 percent of drivers of private cars and
17.1 percent of scooter riders switched to public transportation.</P>
      <P>For those respondents who have not changed their mode of transportation despite
pricier fuel, the top two reasons given were that the distance between their
home and destination was too far, and the convenience of using their private
vehicle.</P>
      <P>The department said that the survey results clearly show that the city's
transportation network must be improved and made more convenient in order to
attract more riders.</P>
      <P>The telephone survey polled Taipei residents 21 years and older between July 22
and 26, with 1,982 valid samples. The results had a margin of error of plus or
minus 2.2 percent.</P>

      <P>Foreign Minister Francisco H.L. Ou Friday downplayed concerns that China would
use the opening ceremony of the Beijing Olympics to engage in diplomatic
maneuvering,  as the government has felt the good will demonstrated by its
Chinese counterpart.</P>
      <P>"We have felt that the Chinese government has made efforts to show us good will,
" Ou said in response to a reporter's question after attending the foreign
ministry's annual family day event.</P>
      <P>The highly-anticipated Olympic Games opening ceremony is slated to kick off at
8: 08 p.m. Beijing time with more than 80 heads of state and hundreds of
politicians from all over the world in attendance.</P>
      <P>While China is using the event to showcase its rising power to the world, some
are concerned that Beijing will use the opportunity to lure away Taiwan's
diplomatic allies.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs said earlier, however, that Taiwan's 23
diplomatic allies will not send their heads of state or vice presidents to the
Beijing Olympics' opening ceremony on Aug. 8, dispatching instead sports
officials or Olympic Committee chairmen.</P>
      <P>The foreign ministry said the development is a positive indicator of solid
relations with the allies.</P>
      <P>Since President  Ma Ying-jeou's  May 20 inauguration,  the previously frosty
cross-strait relations have gradually thawed, with Taiwan easing restrictions on
commercial exchanges, allowing weekend direct charter flights and opening up to
more Chinese tourists.</P>
      <P>Ma has proposed a modus vivendi approach in dealing with China and has proposed
a "diplomatic truce" with Taiwan's cross-strait rival that he has argued would
end the wasting of resources to lure each other's allies and find a way to let
Taiwan have more space in the international community.</P>

      <P>The Consumers' Foundation urged men who shave to sterilize their electric shaver
blades and razor blades regularly with a 70-percent ethanol solution because
they accumulate bacteria at a rapid rate.</P>
      <P>Hsieh Tien-jen, acting chairman of the foundation, on Thursday made public the
findings of a random test of five razors and five electric shavers used by
consumers aged 28-57 where the blades had been used an average of two months.</P>
      <P>The total bacterial count in one of the blades was more than 100 million colony
forming units (cfu), Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>That was far higher than the 10,000 to 100,000 cfu of bacteria found on
children's pool balls in a foundation survey in April and the 100,000 to 1
million cfu found on 12 NT$100 notes in a foundation survey in September, said
foundation executive Yu Kei-hsiung.</P>
      <P>Total bacterial count is an indicator of the hygienic condition of a sample and
an estimate of the total number of bacteria in an object.</P>
      <P>The blade with the high bacterial count had been used two to three times for the
past two months and only cleaned with water, Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>Tseng Hsin-lung, a dermatologist and member of the foundation, said manual
razors can be cleaned easily, but given that they are usually placed in higher
humidity restrooms, skin follicles and human lipids left in the blades cannot be
removed thoroughly simply by rinsing them in water.</P>
      <P>That leads to a bacterial buildup, Tseng said. He suggested using ethanol at a
concentration of more than 70 percent to sterilize the blades.</P>
      <P>He also advised those who cut or scrape their skins while shaving to disinfect
the wounds and seek medical treatment to avoid the risk of developing an
infection.</P>

      <P>It's unfortunate to see China not using the opportunity of hosting the 2008
Olympic Games to demonstrate that it can be more politically open, instead
maintaining tight control over activities calling for human rights and
democracy, the spokesman for Taiwan's opposition Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) said Friday.</P>
      <P>Cheng Wen-tsang, the DPP's director of its Department of Culture and
Information, said that with the Olympics set to formally open Friday, China is
in the spotlight, with the world watching to see whether  the communists  would
grow more open because of the international event.</P>
      <P>Beijing, however, has still suppressed human rights and the freedom of the
press, Cheng said, accusing the Chinese authorities of putting wiretaps on
yellow cabs in Beijing while acting to control Internet reporting.</P>
      <P>Worldwide political observers will also be looking to see whether the core
problems concerning China's future development will be resolved after the end of
the Beijing Olympics on Aug. 24, the spokesman added.</P>
      <P>Cheng said there are many things worth seeing on the Olympic stage, including
human rights activities, and urged Taiwan's media not merely to focus on
individual sports events.</P>
      <P>The DPP made its observations on China's political practices ahead of the
opening of the world' biggest sporting competition, which attracts over 11,000
athletes from 205 countries and areas around the world to compete for 302 gold

      <P>The Ministry of Education (MOE) urged low- enrollment colleges Friday to
consider reductions,  mergers or shutdowns in the face of recruitment
difficulties.</P>
      <P>The ministry issued the call after the Joint Board of the College Recruitment
Commission earlier Friday published a list of the freshmen recruited this year
by every four-year university and college in the country.</P>
      <P>A total of 105 departments at 22 colleges were unable to attract enough
students, leaving 4,788 vacancies. That gap occurred despite this year's all-
time college admission rate of 97.10 percent, the commission said.</P>
      <P>Diwan College of Management and Hsing Kuo University, both in Tainan City, and
Chiayi County's Toko University were noticeably unpopular among would-be college
freshmen. Some departments run by these institutes did not attract a single
applicant.</P>
      <P>Ho Cho-fei, director of the MOE's Department of Higher Education, asked low-
enrollment colleges to study the possibility of staff and department reductions,
mergers with other schools, transforming unpopular programs or shutting down
completely.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, Ho emphasized that such schools should remain committed to
giving their students sufficient training, no matter how small their
enrollments.</P>
      <P>The ministry will require low-enrollment schools to set a threshold for
admission and graduation to maintain their students' basic performance.</P>
      <P>According to the MOE official, some 125 college or university departments  are
considering merging with other departments or shutting down by the fall of 2009.
Seventy-six college departments are slated to merge or close by September this
year, and 103 merged or closed the previous year.</P>
      <P>With the nation's birth rate still falling, the ministry is also mulling a
reduction in the recruitment targets of some college departments, he noted.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP's) legislative caucus filed
treason charges against President Ma Ying-jeou Friday over his decision to
revpke the classification of documents allegedly implicating his predecessor in
a "state affairs fund" embezzlement case.</P>
      <P>Filing the charges with the Taipei District Court, caucus whip Ker Chien-ming
accused Ma of engaging in a "hateful struggle" against former President Chen
Shui-bian at the expense of national security and interests, an act which Ker
said is totally unbecoming of a national leader.</P>
      <P>"The disclosure of the documents in court proceedings will definitely impact
national security, the country's secret diplomacy and even relations with
diplomatic allies," Ker warned.</P>
      <P>In response to the DPP's move, Presidential Office spokesman Wang Yu-chi
stressed President  Ma's decision "can withstand public scrutiny" because the
documents did not meet the criteria of confidentiality and should not have been
classified in the first place.</P>
      <P>At issue are files held by the Taipei District Court as evidence in the "state
affairs fund" case, in which Chen was named as a co-defendant as soon as he
stepped down from the presidency May 20.</P>
      <P>The prosecution named Chen as a "joint perpetrator" while indicting his wife, Wu
Shu-jen, on charges of corruption and forgery Nov. 3, 2006, after determining
she had used receipts provided by others to claim reimbursements totaling
NT$14.8 million (US$450,000) from the president's "state affairs fund" between
July 2002 and March 2006.</P>
      <P>Chen said that none of the money went into his own pocket, contending the
confusing accounting system governing Presidential Office expenses made it
necessary to use outside receipts to obtain money from the discretionary fund to
finance secret diplomatic missions abroad.</P>
      <P>However, the Taipei District Court ruled on Jan. 19, 2007 that the six
diplomatic missions cited by the president as having been funded by the state
affairs fund were not secret as the president claimed, and should be disclosed
in court proceedings.</P>
      <P>In September 2007, Chen proclaimed the files held by the court as "strictly
confidential" and petitioned the court to return them to the Presidential
Office.</P>
      <P>After his request was turned down by the district court, Chen appealed to the
Taiwan High Court and later to the Supreme Court, which has not ruled on the
appeal.</P>
      <P>The process has since stalled the district court proceedings on the embezzlement
case.</P>

      <P>National bird researchers have documented the complete breeding process of a
bird subspecies endemic to Taiwan to enrich the country's wildlife database, a
researcher told the Central News Agency Friday.</P>
      <P>The video, which recorded the nesting, hatching and brooding of the "Vivid
Niltava" subspecies in the southern county of Pingtung, will be a precious
resource for bird lovers, said Tang Hsiao-yu, director of the Endemic Species
Research Institute under the Council of Agriculture.</P>
      <P>The middle-sized Vivid Niltava-- measuring about 15 to 16 centimeters in length
-- resides in forests at elevations ranging from 1,000-2,500 meters and breeds
from April to August every year, Tang said.</P>
      <P>The subspecies, protected under the Wildlife Conservation Act, lays two to four
eggs each time, with a hatching period of about two weeks and brooding time a
little longer, Tang said, adding that the bird feeds babies with insects such as
moths and butterflies or their larvas.</P>
      <P>According to Tang, the male of the vivid Niltava subspecies found in Taiwan is
deep purple blue on the head and back and bright orange below the throat and
face, while the female is olive-brown overall and lighter below, with a light
buffy throat and greyish brown crown and nape.</P>
      <P>The video was made with a digital camera by a group of researchers at the
institute's Medium Altitude Experimental Station in the southern county of
Kaohsiung, who have conducted long-term field research on wild animals and
plants.</P>
      <P>The researchers have contributed much to establishing a database of the life
history, distribution and inhabitation of bird species living in areas of medium
altitudes, host to about 80 bird species, including eight endemic species and 38
endemic subspecies, Tang said.</P>

      <P>A man from the southern city of Kaohsiung has been sentenced to four months in
prison for sending a letter of threat and two goat testicles to Taipei Mayor Hau
Lung-bin, which the Taipei District Court ruled as a crime Thursday.</P>
      <P>The court said Chuang Shun-kui,  who disapproved of Hau's implementation of a
"two-step" process in Taipei for a referendum vote and the 7th legislative
elections earlier this year, prompting him to send the letter and the testicles
to Taipei City Hall in November 2007, with an intention to cause fears to Hau
and his staff.</P>
      <P>The penalty can be converted to a fine, and is subject to appeal.</P>
      <P>Chuang denied that he was intended to threaten Hau, arguing that he was
exercising his freedom of speech to protest the mayor's decision.</P>
      <P>He further contended that as the testicles were edible, they should not cause
fears to any one.</P>
      <P>Hau himself testified about the fear triggered by the threat. However, he
expressed his respect for Chuang's differing opinions and said he has no
intention to press any charge against Chuang.</P>
      <P>According to the court, Chuang expressed his discontent in an irrational way and
showed no remorse for his actions, and thereby should be given a four months'
imprisonment.</P>

      <P>Tourism on the outlying Matsu Island has been declining since the start of this
month, the beginning of "ghost month" on the lunar calendar, tourism officials
said Friday.</P>
      <P>Officials at the Matsu National Scenic Area Administration attributed the drop
in tourism to fears related to "ghost month." Traditional-minded Taiwanese
believe it's unsafe to travel during ghost month, which this year runs from Aug.
1 to Aug. 30.</P>
      <P>Group tours accounted for the fall in business, while the numbers of individual
travelers did not decrease noticeably, officials said. Most of the tourists
visiting the outlying island are backpackers.</P>
      <P>During the first half of this year, tourists made a total of 33,000 visits to
Matsu, up by some 3,000 visits year on year.</P>
      <P>Tourism on Matsu is expected to rebound in September and October -- the peak
travel season on the remote island.</P>
      <P>Matsu is situated in the Taiwan Strait, just off the coast of China. It has

consolidated revenue reached NT$31.81 billion (US$1.02 billion), recording a 7.9
percent rise from the previous month and year-on-year growth of 7.9 percent.</P>
      <P>The firm's accumulated consolidated revenues in the first seven months amounted
to NT$207.43 billion, registering growth of 22.5 percent compared with the same
period in 2007.</P>
      <P>Expecting a slowdown in market demand, TSMC executives estimated that the firm's
third-quarter revenues this year will be between NT$90  billion  and NT$92
billion.  Accordingly,  single-month consolidated revenue is expected to drop to
between NT$29 billion and NT$30 billion in August and September, they said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Hon Hai Precision's July unconsolidated revenues reached NT$130.27
billion, posting growth of 21.2 percent from the previous month, or year-on-year
growth of 34.93 percent.</P>
      <P>Hon Hai spokesman Edmund Ding said that most of the products the firm sold in
July were consumer electronics products.</P>
      <P>The firms' accumulated revenues hit NT$745.67 billion in the first seven months
this year, marking annual growth of 22.8 percent, Hon Hai said.</P>

      <P>State-run oil refiner CPC Corp., Taiwan, announced Friday that it will cut
gasoline prices by NT$2 per liter and diesel prices by NT$2.2 per liter,
effective at midnight, the first drop in fuel prices in Taiwan since last
September.</P>
      <P>After the adjustment, the prices of 92-octane, 95-octane and 98-octane unleaded
gasoline will fall to NT$33.4 per liter, NT$34.1 per liter and NT$35.6 per
liter.</P>
      <P>The prices of premium diesel will be cut to NT$31.3 per liter, and that of super
diesel will also fall to NT$31.3 per liter.</P>
      <P>According to CPC, the adjustment was made based on a floating pricing mechanism
that revises prices on a weekly basis based on fluctuations in the prices of
Dubai and Brent crude oil as quoted on Platts, a leading global provider of
energy information.</P>
      <P>The mechanism had adjusted prices on a monthly basis in June and July, but CPC
Corp. and the Ministry of Economic Affairs decided to change it to a weekly
system to be more sensitive to changes in crude oil prices.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the privately owned Formosa Petrochemical Co. (FPCC) decided the same
day to follow CPC Corp.' lead and cut gasoline and diesel prices by NT$2 and
NT$1.6 a liter, respectively, also effective midnight.</P>

      <P>The nation's top financial regulator expressed the hope Friday that it will
attract 200 overseas firms to list in Taiwan in four years' time.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's  government  wants  to turn the country  into an Asia-Pacific
financial  services,  asset  management,  and capital-raising center, and
recently relaxed restrictions on overseas firms listing publicly in Taiwan to
help move closer to the goal.</P>
      <P>One of the groups targeted to list are the overseas arms of companies already
listed in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Financial Supervisory Commission Chairman Gordon S. Chen said Friday there are
currently around 600 such companies, but the foreign entities might still not
meet the qualifications for listing in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Stock Exchange and over-the-counter GreTai Securities Market are now
trying to learn more about their intention to return to Taiwan and go public, he
said.</P>
      <P>The commission will also soon propose other substantive measures to the
Executive Yuan to realize the Asia Pacific financial center initiative, Chen
said.</P>
      <P>The FSC was established in 2004 to promote an integrated financial supervision
system.  The primary objectives  of the commission are to consolidate the
supervision of the banking, securities and insurance sectors, and to act as a
single regulator for all of these industries.</P>

      <P>Local environmental activists repeated their calls for the reduction of carbon
dioxide emissions Friday as they kicked off an exhibition in Taipei.</P>
      <P>The exhibition -- organized by Philips Taiwan, Taiwan High Speed Rail Corp.
(THSRC), Eslite Bookstore and the Environmental Quality Protection Foundation --
focuses on energy-saving illumination, green transportation, green buildings and
toxic-free clothing.</P>
      <P>The exhibition, which will run through Aug. 24 at the bookstore's branch in the
city's shopping district of Hsinyi, will inform visitors about environmental
statistics and new information, the organizers said.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan is the world's fourth-largest producer of carbon dioxide emissions," the
organizers said, adding that the country should work harder to cut such
pollutants.</P>
      <P>The exhibition also showcases installation art to raise the public's eco-
friendly awareness, the organizers said.</P>
      <P>For example, the exhibition features two black carbon balls, one 330cm in
diameter and the other 30cm, the organizers noted. The two balls are designed to
show a stark difference between emissions generated by vehicles and that of the
country's high-speed rail, the organizers explained.</P>
      <P>The high-speed rail has seen 33 million visits from local residents over the
past 18 months, which has helped reduce some 53 tons of carbon dioxide
emissions, said Ted Chia, vice president of the company's public affairs
division.</P>
      <P>It would take more than 14 million trees to offset the reduced amount, Chia
said.</P>
      <P>Another piece of installation art features a small piece of grass with several
cotton-made clothes on top and bottles of toxic pesticide underneath, the
organizers said.</P>
      <P>The organizers noted that cotton fields account for less than 3 percent of the
world's cultivated land, but use excessive amounts of pesticide.</P>
      <P>Yeh Shin-cheng, a board member of the foundation, said that one pork chop meal
box, a common food in Taiwan, causes some 480g of carbon dioxide emissions.</P>
      <P>Yeh called for a simple diet, which he said would also be good for the
environment.</P>

      <P>Taitung Magistrate Kuang Li-chen, along with her secretary and 13 county
government officials, was listed Thursday as a defendant subject to further
investigation over suspected irregularities related to a just-concluded trip she
made to Europe, according to the local prosecutors office.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors said they intend to further investigate whether she squandered
public funds or gave taxpayers' money to her grassroots campaign operatives and
are seeking a sentence of at least 10 years if she is found guilty of graft.</P>
      <P>Kuang was released Tuesday after being questioned by prosecutors for more than
four hours over the suspected irregularities regarding her Europe trip.</P>
      <P>Kuang, accompanied by the 13 county government officials and township chiefs,
returned to Taipei Monday morning from her visits to several European countries,
ostensibly to observe and study their tourism promotion measures.</P>
      <P>Kuang came under fire after taking the officials on the trip in late July even
though she knew that Typhoon Fung Wong was approaching the island. She has also
been criticized for spending millions of dollars of taxpayers' money on frequent
overseas trips since taking office as Taitung magistrate two years ago.</P>

      <P>Trips overseas by mayors and county magistrates have a positive value if they
are beneficial to their administrative districts and do not affect the promotion
of the local government's policies, said Hsinchu City Mayor Lin Junq-tzer
Friday.</P>
      <P>Lin cited his participation in the fifth World Technopolis Association Techno-
Mart held in Dubai as an example of a trip with value. The flags of Taiwan and
Hsinchu were hung in the Techno-Mart exhibition hall, and Hsinchu was introduced
as one of the members in the show brochure for the first time.</P>
      <P>He also noted Hsinchu's famous rice noodles and traditional glass industry
became recognized and marketed in Japan after he introduced the origins and
development of the two products during a trip to Japan.</P>
      <P>Lin was recently ranked as the local leader with the highest support among
Taiwan's 25 counties and cities in a survey on competitiveness conducted by the
Global Views Magazine, which he said resulted in part from his valuing people's
opinions and being attentive to their needs.</P>
      <P>Besides paving roads, communicating, and setting up street lamps, he has also
built bridges and built new roadways, Lin said.</P>
      <P>Lin said the unemployment rate in Hsinchu had dropped from 5.3 percent when he
took over as Hsinchu mayor in 2006 to the current 3.8 percent as a result of
holding six annual employment fairs and requesting companies in the Hsinchu
Science Park to offer jobs to local residents.</P>
      <P>His principles for promoting administrative policies are absolute respect and
effective communicating, said Lin, and he values the opinions of city councilors
who represent the city's residents.</P>

      <P>Huang Chao-huan, deputy chief of the Bureau of Social Affairs, presided over the
opening of the service center, located in a children's day care center in a
local residential community in Cianjhen district.</P>
      <P>The Kaohsiung city government began establishing service centers for foreign

      <P>In addition to serving as locations for social gatherings, the officials said,
the centers offer cultural courses, professional training, and free

and another 7,645 husbands and wives from other foreign countries in the city,

      <P>The Poultry Association became the first interest group to register after the
Lobbying Act went into effect Friday.</P>
      <P>Lu Yun-tian and Chen Kuo-tsun, who represent the association, registered with
the Legislative Yuan to lobby against a proposed amendment of a poultry
legislation.</P>
      <P>Under the new act, lobbyists must register with the institution they want to
approach and indicate the topic of discussion. After their meetings, they are
also required to report how much they spent on their efforts.</P>
      <P>Acted in accordance with the law, Lu and Chen registered their names and the
person they wanted to lobby -- Legislator Huang Wei-cher of the opposition
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in this case.</P>
      <P>Lu also put his estimated expenses at NT$100,000 (US$3,278) to lobby against the
proposed amendment of a poultry law which limit the validity of a poultry farm's
registration certificate to five years, at which time it would have to apply for
a new one.</P>
      <P>Lu argued that this would undermine the interests of the poultry farm operator.</P>
      <P>Lu touted the law as a "positive" step. In contrast with past practices  when
lobbyists  had to meet with  legislators  or administrative agencies privately
to discuss issues and problems, he said the law makes the lobbying process "open
and transparent."</P>
      <P>But several civic groups criticized the new law and urged that it be revised.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Huang Sue-ying noted that profit-oriented groups are not as
trustworthy as nonprofits but are not subject to more rigorous regulations under
the new law.</P>
      <P>Judicial Reform Foundation Executive Director Lin Feng-cheng said that the
lobbyists must register first and begin the lobbying after being approved, and
they have to file for financial expenses after concluding  the lobbying,  a
process  he termed as "tediously complicated."</P>
      <P>But he said that for the rich and powerful, such as big conglomerates, they
might reach a tacit agreement with the lawmakers circumventing the registration
process.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Women's Link director Lin Lu-hung said civic groups should help each
other, but the Lobbying Act stipulates that a group should only lobby on matters
that are related to its operations.</P>
      <P>Lin said that if a women's group wants to lobby on tax issues, it will not be
able to register, which she said is in effect a boycott of inter-civic group
alliances.</P>
      <P>Under the new law, those who can be lobbied include the president, the vice
president, elected officials at various levels, chiefs and deputies of city and
county governments and village, township and city offices, as well as those who
are covered by the Statute Governing the Retirement and Consolation Payment to
Political Appointee.</P>
      <P>The total number in all categories is over 5,800. At the same time, 740 of their
governing agencies will also be covered by the new law.</P>

aides, particularly legislators' assistants, should be subject to the
restrictions of the newly enacted Lobbying Act, the ministry said in a statement
Friday.</P>
      <P>The Lobbying Act, which cleared the legislative floor in July 2007 and took
effect Aug. 8 this year, requires people who lobby elected and appointed
government officials at national and local levels to register their visits and
list their activities.</P>
      <P>The law drew criticism even before taking effect because of potential flaws and
loopholes, including the failure to include lawmakers' aides among those who
lobbyists must register to visit.</P>

law in deciding whether to include lawmakers' aides in the act when it drafts an

      <P>The Lobbying Act, which cleared the legislative floor in July 2007 and took
effect Aug. 8 this year, requires people who lobby elected and appointed
government officials at national and local levels to register their visits and
list their activities.</P>
      <P>The law drew criticism even before taking effect because of potential flaws and
loopholes, including the failure to include lawmakers' aides among those who
lobbyists must register to visit.</P>
      <P>The MOI said in its statement that the ministry will refer to the U.S. lobbying
law in deciding whether to include lawmakers' aides in the act when it drafts an
amendment bill to perfect or update its provisions in line with the principles
of substantiating  the "sunshine law" spirit and establishing clean politics and
good governance.</P>
      <P>The statement further said the ministry welcomes local citizens to express their
opinions about improving the new act and has posted a form for people to express
their views on its Web site at www.moi.gov.tw/lobby/.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is the third country after the United States and Canada to enact a
lobbying law.</P>

      <P>The Poultry Association became the first interest group to register after the
Lobbying Act went into effect Friday.</P>
      <P>Lu Yun-tian and Chen Kuo-tsun, who represent the association, registered with
the Legislative Yuan to lobby against a proposed amendment of a poultry
legislation.</P>
      <P>Under the new act, lobbyists must register with the institution they want to
approach and indicate the topic of discussion. After their meetings, they are
also required to report how much they spent on their efforts.</P>
      <P>Acted in accordance with the law, Lu and Chen registered their names and the
person they wanted to lobby -- Legislator Huang Wei-cher of the opposition
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in this case.</P>
      <P>Lu also put his estimated expenses at NT$100,000 (US$3,278) to lobby against the
proposed amendment of a poultry law which limit the validity of a poultry farm's
registration certificate to five years, at which time it would have to apply for
a new one.</P>
      <P>Lu argued that this would undermine the interests of the poultry farm operator.</P>
      <P>Lu touted the law as a "positive" step. In contrast with past practices  when
lobbyists  had to meet with  legislators  or administrative agencies privately
to discuss issues and problems, he said the law makes the lobbying process "open
and transparent."</P>
      <P>But several civic groups criticized the new law and urged that it be revised.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Huang Sue-ying noted that profit-oriented groups are not as
trustworthy as nonprofits but are not subject to more rigorous regulations under
the new law.</P>
      <P>Judicial Reform Foundation Executive Director Lin Feng-cheng said that the
lobbyists must register first and begin the lobbying after being approved, and
they have to file for financial expenses after concluding  the lobbying,  a
process  he termed as "tediously complicated."</P>
      <P>But he said that for the rich and powerful, such as big conglomerates, they
might reach a tacit agreement with the lawmakers circumventing the registration
process.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Women's Link director Lin Lu-hung said civic groups should help each
other, but the Lobbying Act stipulates that a group should only lobby on matters
that are related to its operations.</P>
      <P>Lin said that if a women's group wants to lobby on tax issues, it will not be
able to register, which she said is in effect a boycott of inter-civic group
alliances.</P>
      <P>Under the new law, those who can be lobbied include the president, the vice
president, elected officials at various levels, chiefs and deputies of city and
county governments and village, township and city offices, as well as those who
are covered by the Statute Governing the Retirement and Consolation Payment to
Political Appointee.</P>
      <P>The total number in all categories is over 5,800. At the same time, 740 of their
governing agencies will also be covered by the new law.</P>

the centers offer cultural courses, professional training, and free

    <TEXT>
      <P>The housing turnover in Hsinchu County posted a strong year-on-year growth of
more that 30 percent in the first half of 2008, despite a slowdown in Taiwan's
overall housing market, making the county the country's top performer in this
regard, according to statistics released Saturday by the Ministry of the
Interior.</P>
      <P>During the first six months of this year, the number of housing transactions
around Taiwan dropped 2 percent year-on-year to 211,011, with 14 out of the 23
counties and cities islandwide experiencing negative growth compared with the
same period of last year, the statistics show.</P>
      <P>Among the nine counties and cities that saw housing transactions increase,
Hsinchu County topped the list with growth of more than 30 percent, followed by
Taipei City, which recorded a rise of 9.1 percent.</P>
      <P>Chang Hsin-min, a marketing consultant with Era Real Estate, Taiwan, noted that
in the past, Hsinchu County was not an important local housing  market  in
Taiwan,  recording  only 2,000-3,000 transactions per year and lagging far
behind neighboring Hsinchu City.</P>
      <P>However, housing transactions in Hsinchu County have exceeded that of Hsinchu
City since 2004, following the development of areas surrounding the Hsinchu
county government headquarters in Jhubei and the construction of the high-speed
rail system that includes a stop in Jhubei, Chang said.</P>
      <P>With the launch of the rail system in 2007 significantly shortening the travel
time to Taipei City and Taichung City, where housing prices are higher, many
workers in hi-tech companies in the Hsinchu Science Park in Hsinchu City have
opted to reside in Jhubei, he pointed out.</P>
      <P>He predicted that housing transactions will remain brisk in Hsinchu County in
the second half of this year, with the transaction volume for 2008 likely to
surpass the 13,516 cases recorded in 2005 to hit a record high.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's "golden doubles duo" may have felt slighted at not being made the top
seeds in the Olympic women's doubles event Thursday, but they have a tough road
ahead to prove they actually deserved the top slot in the tournament.</P>
      <P>None of Taiwan's tennis Olympians got kind draws in the three Beijing Games
tournaments in which they are entered, not even the highly regarded doubles team
of Chan Yung-jan and Chuang Chia-jung, seen as Taiwan's best hope of winning its
first ever Olympic tennis medal.</P>
      <P>Local media had widely speculated the duo would be seeded first in Beijing based
on having the highest doubles rankings of any team entered in the 32-team
Olympic event.</P>
      <P>But when the draw was made Thursday, Chan and Chuang were made the third seeds,
and some local media speculated -- without any substantiation -- that pressure
from China was behind the change.</P>
      <P>Not so, says the International Tennis Federation, which set the regulations for
the event and was responsible for the method of seeding.</P>
      <P>"The Olympic tennis event is unique in that many players play both singles and
doubles, " said Neil Robinson, a spokesman for the federation, in an e-mail. "It
was therefore decided that for the doubles event in Beijing, a player's best
ranking of singles and doubles would be taken and that this would be added to
the partner's best ranking for seeding."</P>
      <P>The system was actually more targeted at the men's doubles than the women's,
with top singles players like Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, and Novak Djokovic
entered in the event.</P>
      <P>The three, who rarely play doubles on the ATP Tour and have doubles rankings
outside the top 100, would have been unseeded without help from their singles
rankings. The revised system ensures that none of them will play each other in
the early rounds of the doubles.</P>
      <P>In the women's event, Chan and Chuang were seeded third, behind Svetlana
Kuznetsova and Dinara Safina of Russia and Serena and Venus Williams of the
United States.</P>
      <P>"The lower seeding will only motivate us to have a fiercer desire to win, " Chan
said, while Chuang, after getting over her surprise, saw it as an advantage.</P>
      <P>"I really didn't care if we were the number one seeds. Now the pressure won't be
on us," Chuang told local media.</P>
      <P>But aside from what should be a relatively easy opening match against Alize
Cornet and Virginie Razzano of France, neither of whom are ranked in the top 100
in doubles, Chan and Chuang face traps elsewhere in the draw.</P>
      <P>If they can get by their second round match against either Alicia Molik and
Casey Dellacqua of Australia or the gritty Italian duo of Francesca Schiavone
and Flavia Pennetta in the second round, all of whom are accomplished doubles
players, they will likely have to face the sixth-seeded Australian Open doubles
champions Kateryna and Alona Bondarenko.</P>
      <P>And that's the easy part, because in the semifinals, Chan and Chuang will likely
come up against Venus and Serena Williams (if Serena's knee stays healthy), who
won the Wimbledon doubles crown losing no more than four games in any one set.</P>
      <P>In singles, Chan and Taiwan's top men's player Lu Yen-hsun both got difficult
draws.</P>
      <P>Lu drew 6th-seeded Andy Murray of the United Kingdom in the opening round of the
64-player men's singles tourney, while Chan Yung-jan drew eighth-seeded
Agnieszka Radwanska of Poland in the first round of the women's event.</P>
      <P>Lu, who had hoped to improve on his first round defeat to Finland's Jarkko
Nieminen in the 2004 Athens Games, will have a tough time with Murray, one of
the hottest players on tour after winning the ATP Masters Series event in
Cincinnati.</P>
      <P>"He's one of those players who you can never put away. He competes hard and
attacks well, so I'm going to have be a little patient against him," Lu told
local media.</P>
      <P>Chan is scheduled to play her first round singles match Sunday afternoon, while
Lu and the women's doubles team are expected to play their first matches on
Monday.</P>

      <P>According to Fang Guo-yun, chief of the department of nature conservation of the
Forestry Bureau, a panel will be established Aug. 14 to review the submissions
of the two applicants, the Taipei Zoo in the capital and the Leofoo Safari Zoo

      <P>The Leofoo Safari Zoo has expressed determination to house the pandas and
recently signed an agreement with the China-based Chengdu Research  Base of
Giant Panda Breeding  in order to exchange information, experiences and ideas on
conservation, according to the zoo.</P>

      <P>A documentary about Taiwan's Atayal tribe, which won an award at an American
film festival earlier this year, has presented Taiwan's aboriginal cultures to
the world, a Ministry of the Interior official said Saturday.</P>
      <P>The official made the remarks to mark the world's Aug. 9 celebration of the
International Day of the World's Indigenous Peoples, designated by the United
Nations in 1994.</P>
      <P>The film, titled "A Thousand Years of the Atayal" won the Platinum Award, the
highest prize, at the 41st WorldFest Houston International Film Festival in the
culture category in late April, the official said.</P>
      <P>The Atayal is one of Taiwan's 14 aboriginal tribes to have received official
recognition. Its culture includes facial tattooing, the inheritance of a
father's first name as the son's last name, weaving and a united community
typically occupying a single valley or flood plain.</P>
      <P>The documentary revolves around the life of an Atayal man called Yukan who lives
in the city and decides to return to an Atayal village to find out his identity.</P>
      <P>Directed by Chen Wen-pin,  the film was sponsored by the administrative center
of Sheipa National Park, home to many Atayal tribal communities, the official
involved in the management of the country's national parks said.</P>
      <P>Atayal people not only were filmed but also contributed to discussions and
production of the film, the official said.</P>
      <P>They also constructed an ancient Atayal village for the film's setting, he went
on, adding that the shooting site in the northern county of Hsinchu will be
turned into a public cultural treasure for the tribe.</P>
      <P>The film was also selected as Best Film at the New Beijing International Movie
Week held in June and will be screened at the Moscow International Visual
Anthropology Festival in October, the official added.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's ruling Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Wu Poh-hsiung visited the Beijing
Athletes' Village Saturday to cheer the Chinese Taipei delegation and present
the members with an additional NT$200,000 (US$6,396) in spending money.</P>
      <P>Wu Poh-hsiung was accompanied by Legislative Yuan Deputy Speaker Tseng Yung-
chuan, KMT Secretary-General Wu Den-yih and other top officials.</P>
      <P>Wu Poh-hsiung said the Chinese Taipei athletes' participation in the games will
not lead to a downgrading of Taiwan's status, in clear reference to recent
claims by the opposition Democratic Progressive Party that Beijing has been
attempting to do just that through various means, such as insisting on the use
of simplified characters, which are used in China rather than the traditional
characters used in Taiwan, on the Chinese Taipei delegation's sign in the
Olympic opening ceremony.</P>
      <P>Wu expressed hope that the Taiwanese athletes will perform outstandingly at the
games, adding that the recent birth of Chinese Taipei Olympic Committee Chairman
Tsai Chen-wei's grandson should help bring the team luck.</P>
      <P>Tsai, along with Sports Affairs Council Minister Tai Hsia-ling and Chinese
Taipei Olympic delegation leader Tsai Szu-chueh, were on hand to receive Wu upon
his arrival in the village.</P>
      <P>After presenting the NT$200,000 to the delegation, Wu talked about the Chinese
Taipei baseball team's first game of the Olympics against the Netherlands slated
for Aug. 13, saying that China-based Taiwanese businessmen have mobilized a
"Taiwanese cheerleading squad" by buying up most of the tickets for the game.</P>
      <P>This, coupled with the Chinese spectators' support for the Taiwanese squad,
means that the team will have a virtual "home field advantage" for the game,
according to Wu.</P>

      <P>The deputy whip of the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) legislative caucus predicted
Saturday that the public will judge President Ma Ying-jeou fairly for his
decision to revoke classification of documents related to former President Chen
Shui-bian's state affairs fund case.</P>
      <P>Wu Yu-sheng made the comments at a news conference held one day after lawmakers
of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) sued Ma for treason for
declassifying information Chen had deemed national secrets while he was
president.</P>
      <P>The documents are being held by the Taipei District Court as evidence in a
corruption and forgery scandal in which Chen has been named a "joint
perpetrator" and his wife has been indicted for using receipts provided by
others to claim a total of NT$14.8 million (US$450,000) from the president's
discretionary state affairs fund.</P>
      <P>Wu said at Saturday's press conference that the public and even elements within
the DPP support Ma's decision to declassify the documents,  claiming that some
opposition  lawmakers have said privately that the matter will allow the party
to finally separate itself from the former president and let new DPP Chairwoman
Tsai Ing-wen move the party forward.</P>
      <P>The deputy whip added that if the DPP continues to protect what he described as
"the corrupt former president, " this will only hurt the party in future
elections.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Opposition leader against `diplomatic truce'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  9 (CNA)
08/09/08  17:59:18
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen expressed
strong disapproval Saturday of President Ma Ying-jeou's foreign policy advocacy
of a "diplomatic truce" with China, saying the idea is tantamount to a
"unilateral surrender of arms" on Taiwan's part.</P>
      <P>According to Tsai, Taiwan's isolation in the international arena is the result
of China's suppression and as the nation's leader, Ma should find a way to
safeguard Taiwan's international status and highlight the unreasonableness of
China's suppression.</P>
      <P>"Instead, the new government is trying to negotiate with the country's
persecutor and to offer: `I won't struggle. Don't hit me,'" Tsai said, referring
to the "modus vivendi" approach put forth by Ma for dealing with China.</P>
      <P>The former vice premier and former chairwoman of the Mainland Affairs Council
made the remarks while addressing the opening of a conference  on Taiwan's
security situation  since the May 20 inauguration of the Kuomintang (KMT)
government. The event was organized by the Institute for Taiwan Defense and
Strategic Studies.</P>
      <P>Tsai claimed that although the new government has only been in operation for
less than 100 days, its national security policy is causing "worry, distrust and
unease" among the people and is leading Taiwan toward a "dangerous state."</P>
      <P>She accused the KMT government of being "narrow-minded" by believing that all
the problems currently faced by Taiwan will be solved as long as relations with
China improve.</P>
      <P>As such a security policy must rely on Beijing's goodwill in order to be
successful, the government has already started making various concessions before
China has even offered its terms and conditions, Tsai said.</P>
      <P>Besides the "diplomatic truce, " what Tsai described as the KMT administration's
"reckless" liberalization policy toward cross-Taiwan Strait economic and trade
activities and the way it is dealing with the reported suspension of arms
procurements from the United States are two other examples of such concessions,
she said.</P>
      <P>According to Tsai, the KMT, which blocked and delayed the arms procurement when
it was in the opposition, has adopted an "ambiguous" attitude toward the
procurement after coming to power.</P>
      <P>This ambiguous approach is demonstrated by the fact that the KMT administration
has not taken any effective measures to push the United States to approve the
sales rapidly, despite reports and speculation that the administration of
President George W. Bush has frozen arms sales to Taiwan to avoid upsetting
relations with China, Tsai said.</P>
      <P>Asked by the media to comment on KMT Chairman Wu Poh-hsiung's current visit to
China to attend the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games in Beijing, Tsai said
that as the leader of the ruling party, Wu should be extra cautious about his
behavior so as not to give the public the impression that "Taiwan is part of
China."</P>
      <P>Tsai was referring to a statement made by Wu Thursday in Beijing that the
Chinese Taipei baseball team enjoys a "home field advantage" in the Beijing
Olympic Games. She said it was regrettable and disappointing that the KMT leader
would make such a remark, which she claimed seriously undermines Taiwan's status
as a sovereign state independent of China.</P>
      <P>In fact, Wu's remark was a reference to the fact that many of the tickets to the
Chinese Taipei game against the Netherlands have been purchased by Taiwanese
businessmen operating in China.</P>
      <P>Tsai also expressed displeasure at a recent statement by Chinese President Hu
Jintao that "Taiwan stands great chances of winning medals as one of the home
teams, " saying that the statement demonstrates China's insincerity toward
Taiwan.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Activists who were banned from entering Hong Kong Aug. 6 to take part in a
protest rally on the eve of the Olympic opening ceremony, said Saturday in
Taipei that the Beijing Olympics is a total shame and a human rights disaster,
as the Chinese authorities not only continue to violate human rights but also
treat each and every one of its people as the enemy.</P>
      <P>Chinese Canadian democracy activist Sheng Xue, international vice-president of
the Federation for a Democratic China, was detained along with well-known
Chinese activist Yan Jianli when they arrived at Hong Kong airport Aug. 6.</P>
      <P>Sheng diverted to Taiwan, while Yang, a Chinese citizen with a U.S. green card,
was deported under escort back to New York via Tokyo before Taiwan agreed to
permit him entry.</P>
      <P>"This Olympics is `One World, One Nightmare' and an endless human rights
disaster, " Sheng Xue said angrily in a forum titled "Observation of the Beijing
Olympics and Human Rights in China" held by the Taiwan Society North, a pro-
independence non-government organization.</P>
      <P>She contended that the fact they were banned from entering Hong Kong serves as
clear evidence that Hong Kong is becoming China and has submitted all its
authority to a central government.</P>
      <P>"The Beijing Olympics is full of worry and fear, as the totalitarian Chinese
authorities are treating the people like the enemy," Sheng said.</P>
      <P>"The world, especially those live in a democratic and free country, should not
be blinded by the rosy picture of the Beijing Olympics but should see through
the veil and find out what the real society is like -- with people deprived of
their basic rights and freedoms," she added.</P>
      <P>Dawa Tsering, president of the Taipei-based non-government Tibet Religious
Foundation of the Dalai Lama, said that during the Olympics, the Chinese
government has beefed up its control over Tibet, declaring that street
assemblies of more than four people are illegal.</P>
      <P>"This is typical of how colonists treat the colonized, " Dawa said.</P>
      <P>Chinese American Wang Min, who also decided to come to Taiwan Aug. 6 after he
was denied entry to Hong Kong, said that China might have all the hardware to
demonstrate to the world its rising economic power and advanced infrastructure,
but what was lacking in the opening ceremony was the software -- democracy and
civic awareness.</P>
      <P>"The Beijing Olympics -- in which the government is afraid of its people and of
human rights -- conflicts with the Olympic spirit, " Wang said.</P>
      <P>The activists urged people in Taiwan not to take democracy for granted, as it
takes everyone's efforts to protect democracy from being compromised.</P>
      <P>"Taiwanese people should have the courage to safeguard society with justice and
conscience and help China build one of its own as soon as possible," Sheng said.</P>

      <P>Microsoft Taiwan Corp. has opened certification programs on its own project
management tool, aiming to issue certifications to 500 people within one year,
an executive of Microsoft Taiwan said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Alec Cooper, Microsoft Taiwan's general manager of business marketing
operations, said the company cooperated with Taiwan's Advanced Business
Consulting Inc. in providing the certification programs on Microsoft Certified
Technology Specialist Project 2007 (MCTS-Project 2007).</P>
      <P>The MCTS-Project 2007 is a specially designed tool to help project managers
apply best practices and methodologies to result in better project outcomes and
optimal resource management, Cooper said.</P>
      <P>According to Chang Li-yeh, Microsoft Taiwan's product marketing manager, the
number of Taiwanese who received project management professional certification
from the American Project Management Institute last year increased by 49 percent
from the year-earlier level.</P>
      <P>However,  these project  managers  might have the required methodologies, but in
practice, they do not have good tools, so the MCTS-Project 2007 is aimed at
meeting their needs, Chang said.</P>
      <P>There is an increasing need for project management in the industry, Cooper said,
adding that the organizing teams of the Beijing Olympics and the Kaohsiung World
Games 2009 are both using Microsoft Project to manage their international sports
events.</P>
      <P>He added that Microsoft Taiwan will work with more partners to provide
certification programs to project managers in the future.</P>

      <P>Recalling her Olympian efforts in Saturday's 48 kg-class weightlifting event at
the Beijing Olympics, Taiwanese bronze medalist Chen Wei-ling said she kept
thinking that "even if my arms break, I won't let go the barbell" when trying to
lift 115 kg in the clean and jerk part of the contest.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, Chen failed to make the lift, but she pledged to continue
challenging herself to perform better in the next Olympics "so long as the coach
doesn't give up on me."</P>
      <P>Chen lifted 84 kg in the snatch event before moving on to lift 112 kg in the
clean and jerk event for a total score of 196 kg and Taiwan's first medal of the
Olympics.</P>
      <P>South Korea's Im Jyounghwa also lifted a combined 196 kg, but the Taiwanese
weightlifter was awarded the medal in a tie-breaker based on body weight. Chen
weighed in at 47.11 kg, lighter than Im's 47.62 kg.</P>
      <P>China's Chen Xiexia grabbed the gold medal with a combined lift of 212 kg, a new
Olympic record, while Sibel Ozkan of Turkey won silver with a combined lift of
210 kg.</P>
      <P>Before coming to Beijing, Chen was not expected to take any medals in the
world's largest sports event. She placed 11th at the 2004 Athens Olympics, when
she finished the 48 kg competition with a combined lift of 170 kg.</P>
      <P>She said she practiced hard day and night only because her coach, Zhang Jiamin
from China, told her it was possible for her to win an Olympic medal.</P>
      <P>Along with her medal, Chen also won a national award of NT$5 million
(US$160,000) given by the government to honor athletes who perform with

      <P>All fingerprint files of Taipei citizens collected between 2003 and 2005 have
been destroyed by official sanction, Taipei City Government Bureau of Civil
Affairs Deputy Director Chen Chi-yung said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Chen said hard disks containing the fingerprints of more than 700,000 citizens
were cut and smashed at a factory in Taoyuan County a day earlier.</P>
      <P>On hand to witness the destruction were officials from the city government's
Department of Government Ethics and from the Research, Development and
Evaluation Commission, as well as a third impartial party.</P>
      <P>"In response to demands by the public and to prevent possible leaks of personal
data, the information was destroyed," Chen said.</P>
      <P>He noted that Taipei launched a fingerprint authentication and identification
system in 2002 after the Ministry of the Interior discussed the possible
inclusion of such data as fingerprints on new ID cards issued to replace the old
ID cards that were issued in 1996.</P>
      <P>The proposal was eventually ditched when the ID cards were replaced in 2006 out
of concern about infringement of personal privacy.</P>
      <P>He explained that the city's collection of fingerprints was made with good
intentions, despite the criticism that it could lead to leaks of personal data.</P>
      <P>The city government began to permit citizens to use their fingerprint
information in late 2002, allowing citizens who had provided fingerprint records
to attend to Household Registration Office business without the need to provide
their ID cards.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Holding billboards on street becomes popular part-time job</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  9 (CNA)
08/09/08  20:05:07</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>During the current economic recession, people are grabbing all kinds of
opportunities to make money, with some even willing to stand for eight hours a
day on the streets in heavy traffic and in all weather, holding billboards
advertising sumptuous apartments they will probably never afford with their
meager wages.</P>
      <P>These temporary workers can be found every day at the main intersections in
Taipei. Their job is simple and easy: standing still holding an advertising
billboard that indicates to drivers the direction of the real estate being
promoted.</P>
      <P>The phenomenon began after the Taipei City Police Department began to clamp down
in 2005 on advertising vehicles occupying parking spaces on the city streets.
Since then, temporary staffing agencies have hired people for low wages to hold
the billboards.</P>
      <P>Most of them work from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., earning just NT$800 (US$25.6) per day.</P>
      <P>According to the Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) , the minimum hourly wage in
Taiwan is NT$95.</P>
      <P>The workers are allowed to take a 10-minute rest every hour, but are not allowed
to sit down while holding their billboard.</P>
      <P>"Our employer sends `patrols' from time to time to see if we are doing what they
ask, " said an elderly worker who stands at the intersection of Songjiang Road
and Changchun Road five days a week.</P>
      <P>Declining to give his name, the man said he was a retiree and wanted to kill
time and make some money with any job. He was hired by a temporary staffing
agency, as the job requires few skills.</P>
      <P>"At my age, I don't have many choices," he said.</P>
      <P>Showing his tanned arms, the retiree said the hot sun is not a problem for him.
"From 3: 30 p.m., this corner will be shadowed by the neighboring building," he
added resignedly.</P>
      <P>In addition to elderly people, people of working age also consider holding
billboards as a way to earn a little extra income.</P>
      <P>One middle-aged man standing at the intersection of Xinsheng South Road and
Renai Road told CNA that he has been holding billboards every weekend for four
years, even though he has a regular weekday job.</P>
      <P>"The high temperature is tolerable, but what is really annoying is the rain, "
he said, adding that holding a billboard while standing in the rain wearing a
raincoat is not very comfortable.</P>
      <P>He also expressed concern about breathing the polluted air all day, as he is
always posted at intersections where there is heavy traffic, for the best
advertising effect.</P>
      <P>Even though the working conditions are far from satisfactory, however, he said
he is still willing to do the work at the cost of his weekends and family time.</P>
      <P>"The extra earnings -- NT$800 a day -- help boost my earnings, especially during
the period when prices are rising," he said.</P>
      <P>To protect these temporary workers, Ngou Giok-siong, president of the Taiwan
Labor Front, said that if the government will not improve their working
conditions, it should at least guarantee their basic rights.</P>
      <P>"I doubt that the temporary staffing agencies pay insurance for these temporary
workers, who are among the most underprivileged in the work force; the CLA
should investigate the issue," Ngou said.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Saturday that relevant government  agencies should
step up coordination  and cooperation in river cleanup and flood prevention work
to improve operational efficiency.</P>
      <P>Ma issued the directive while inspecting a Dajia river embankment project in
Taichung County's Houli township in central Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Noting that the 140.2 km Dajia river -- the county's longest -- often floods
during typhoon season because of sediment due to excessive land development in
the river's upper reaches, Ma said cleanup work requires the cooperation of many
government agencies, including the Council of Agriculture, Taiwan Power Co.,
which operates several power plants along the river, and the Veterans Affairs
Council, which is responsible for overseeing the farms in the river's upper
stretches operated by retired servicemen.</P>
      <P>Ma said the Water Resources Agency (WRA) under the Ministry of Economic Affairs
should coordinate with those agencies to come up with a comprehensive action
plan.</P>
      <P>"If each agency is responsible for cleanup or flood control on different
sections of the river without taking into account the work being done elsewhere
on the river, the work could lead nowhere, " he added.</P>

      <P>Local doctors urged patients suffering from depression Saturday to continue
their treatment, after statistics were released showing that the ratio of those
who lapse in their treatment is too high.</P>
      <P>Chang Chia-ming, an attending physician in the Department of Psychiatry at Chang

doctors after a single visit, even though continued medication for six months
would achieve much better results.</P>

recurrence rate of 34.7 percent, while those who continue treatment for over 90
days have a recurrence rate of only 5.3 percent.</P>
      <P>"Those who discontinue treatment too soon tend to be young female patients, " he
added.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that an ideal treatment process for depression takes between six
and nine months, preferably one year. Treatment in the first 90 days after a
bout of depression is especially important, he went on, adding that
"uninterrupted treatment is crucial to the treatment of depression."</P>
      <P>Lai Teh-jen,  president of the Taiwan Association  Against Depression, echoed
his words, pointing out that depression is curable and that suspending treatment
before it is complete could make the disease worse.</P>
      <P>Clinical tests have found that with continued treatment and medication for over
six months, 80 percent of depressed patients will experience dramatic
improvement, Lai said.</P>

      <P>The Taiwan branch of American President Line, a global container shipping
company, donated to a foundation Saturday to help 53 aboriginal children.</P>
      <P>Chiang Cheng-yi, an assistant president of the company, noted that the company
has donated to the Taiwan Fund for Children and Families' Hualien branch since
2006 to help with the food expenses of 53 aboriginal children to the tune of
NT$12,000 (US$393) per person per year.</P>
      <P>This year, the company has again donated NT$636,000 to the children, providing
them with their dinners for a year, Chiang said.</P>
      <P>Wang Ching-feng, director of the fund's Hualien branch, said that at present,
the fund helps sponsor 2,900 children from 1,350 families.</P>
      <P>Past experience has shown that many poor children have to shoulder household
chores after school and that because of poverty, they often cannot afford three
meals a day, while the free lunches provided by the schools may be the most
"luxurious" food they get during the course of an entire day, Wang said.</P>

      <P>The Taiwan Association of University Professors (TAUP) organized a mass rally at
Ketagalan Boulevard in front of the Presidential Office Saturday to protest what
it called the current government's tilt toward China.</P>
      <P>It was the third TAUP-organized protest rally in Taipei City since  the  May 20
inauguration  of President  Ma Ying-jeou's administration and drew the largest
number of participants. The previous two rallies took place in Dana Forest Park
and Yuanshan Park, respectively.</P>
      <P>Rally goers waved flags bearing the word "Taiwan" and wore headbands protesting
what they called the Ma administration's tilting-toward-China and selling out
Taiwan policy. Some disgruntled citizens went up to the podium to lash out at
the Kuomintang administration for commodity prices hikes in the past few months.</P>
      <P>Several pro-Taiwan independence groups mobilized members to lend their support.
Hsu Kuo-yung, a former legislator of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) , and Taipei City Councilor Chien Yu-yen served as emcees at the rally.</P>
      <P>Among the prominent participants were outgoing Examination Yuan President Yao
Jia-wen and Taiwan Society Secretary-General  Lo Chih-cheng.  DPP Policy
Coordination Committee Executive Chaung Shou-han showed up at the rally, but
didn't make any public speech.</P>
      <P>Lo said the Ma dministration is arrogant as it refuses to admit many of its
policy blunders. He also accused Ma of backing away from his campaign promises.</P>
      <P>"Ma often expressed his love for Taiwan on campaign trail, but once in power, he
moved to get rid of 'Taiwanization, '" Lo argued, referring to the recent
resumption of state-run postal company's name "Chunghwa Post." The company's
name was changed to Taiwan Post in 2007 in line with the then-DPP
administration's desinicization and Taiwan-centric policy.</P>
      <P>"In the run-up to the presidential poll, Ma often said he took pride in Taiwan,
but now he just likes to say glory of Chinese race," Lo condemned.</P>

Saturday to respect spectators' or visitors' reasonable rights during the

      <P>Yang said after her return to Taoyuan International Airport late Saturday that
she was upset by Beijing's treatment of her.</P>
      <P>According to Yang, she was held by Beijing's customs authorities upon her

      <P>"Beijing should not have issued me an entry permit if it would not accept my

      <P>"I asked why they could treat me so disrespectfully, they replied they were
following their superiors' order," Yang recalled.</P>
      <P>Yang said she was uneasy and even had a feeling of terror during the several
hours of detention. In the end, Beijing officials confiscated her "Taiwan
compatriot certificate" or entry permit and repatriated her to Hong Kong.  Yang
said she will hold a news conference later to recount her ordeal at Beijing
airport.</P>
      <P>Yang and one of her friends, Lee Kun-lin, traveled to Beijing via aweekend

    <HEADLINE>Historic tunnel opens to bicycles</HEADLINE>

      <P>A tunnel on the historic Caoling trail on the northeastern Coast of Taiwan
opened to bicycles Sunday after a year of renovation, making it the country's
longest bicycle tunnel.</P>
      <P>At the opening ceremony,  Minister  of Transportation  and Communications Mao
Chi-kuo said the renovation of the old tunnel was aimed at promoting cycling in
line with the government's green policies  of energy conservation  and carbon
dioxide emissions reduction, and at increasing the appeal of railway tourism.</P>
      <P>He said it was just a start and that in the future, the government, in
conjunction with the tourism industry, will continue to come up with new ways to
launch more fun leisure activities.</P>
      <P>The 15-minute bicycle path through the tunnel is designed based on the concept
of building a "rail tunnel museum" and is decorated with discarded railway
relics that allows cyclists to experience Taiwan's old railway history on two
wheels, according to the Northeast Coast National Scenic Area Administration,
which managed the  construction  in collaboration  with  the Taiwan  Railway
Administration.</P>
      <P>The tunnel is also equipped with public toilets and service centers built around
old disused barracks and blockhouses.</P>
      <P>The 2.1-km Caoling Tunnel was the longest railway tunnel in Taiwan when it
opened in 1924. It was closed in 1986 when the railway line was diverted.</P>
      <P>The tunnel carries great historic importance in the development of Taiwan's
transport system, as it was a main part of the Caoling Trail constructed to
provide an important transport link between Taipei and Yilan when Taiwan was
still a Japanese colony.</P>
      <P>It is also the tunnel referenced in the famous Taiwanese folk song "Diu-Diu
Dang, " the title of which is a phonetic rendition of the sound of the water
dripping from the walls of the tunnel as the train passes through. Cyclists who
ride the tunnel can still hear train whistles from the new Caoling tunnel, which
is still used by trains.</P>
      <P>To attract more people to attend the ceremony, the TRA also arranged a special
passenger train and bus service to the location and offered tickets to enter
several amusement parks in the area.</P>
      <P>The tunnel will open to the public 8: 30 a.m. to 5 p.m. every day and the
Tourism Bureau advised tourists to take advantage of a one-day rail pass
introduced by the TRA, as well as other travel packages offered by local camping
operators.</P>

      <P>Fraud accounts for the largest percentage -- some 40 percent -- of the total
cybercrime cases reported in the first half of this year, the Criminal
Investigation Bureau said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The bureau said that 12,007 cases of Internet crime were reported during the
first six months of this year, down from last year's 13,855, 80.27 percent of
which were solved, up from 65 percent from the same period of last year.</P>
      <P>During the January-June period, 4,981 cases of Internet fraud were reported,
followed by 2,023 cases concerning the infringement of computer usage, the
bureau said.</P>
      <P>Another 1,871 cases involving violations of the Child and Youth Sexual
Transaction Prevention Act,  1,340 cases concerning the infringement of
intellectual property rights,  and 1,131 cases regarding obscenity, were
reported, according to the bureau.</P>
      <P>Police busted the fewest cases in the category of computer usage infringement,
which the bureau explained includes hacking and acquiring, eliminating, or
changing electromagnetic records.</P>
      <P>In this category, the police only busted 368, or 18.2 percent, of the 2,023
cases, the bureau said, adding the percentage still went up from last year's 9.5
percent.</P>
      <P>The police attributed the lowest rate to difficulty in cracking down on hackers,
as they are often traced to China and Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>Most of the computer usage infringement cases are related to cyber games, the
bureau said.</P>

      <P>China Airlines and EVA Air, Taiwan's biggest air carriers, said Sunday they have
no plans to follow their U.S. counterparts' lead in providing wireless Internet
services on flights, as doing so would add a heavier financial burden to the
already high operating costs.</P>
      <P>Following a move by Continental Airlines,  many U.S.-based carriers, including
Delta Airlines, recently announced that they will provide in-flight Wi-Fi
broadband  internet access on domestic flights, a bid that will allow millions
of U.S. domestic airline passengers to log onto the Internet in the air.</P>
      <P>Citing rising costs in the airline  business  sparked  by skyrocketing
international crude oil and raw commodity prices, Taiwan's two largest carriers
have no plans to offer such a service, which requires expensive  equipment  and
high telecommunication charges.</P>
      <P>Bruce Chen, the spokesman of China Airlines, Taiwan's biggest carrier, said the
company offered in-air wireless Internet access from 2005 to 2006 but was forced
to suspend the service due to rising costs.</P>
      <P>"Maybe after the easing of oil prices the company will consider reinstating the
service," he told CNA.</P>
      <P>Chen added that the infrastructure of the in-flight wireless services requires
mainly the installation of satellite antennae, which is very costly.</P>
      <P>"Should the technology advance to the extent where infrastructure costs can be
lowered, the company will also re-evaluate the option of re-launching the
service," he said.</P>
      <P>EVA Air, Taiwan's second-largest airline company, has never planned in-flight
Internet connection due to little market incentive, according to an EVA public
relations manager who spoke on condition of anonymity.</P>
      <P>"The high operating costs of Internet services would force the airline to charge
passengers an additional fee," the manager went on, adding that this would be
another disadvantage of investing in the service.</P>
      <P>The Internet service on Delta's planes will charge each user US$9.95 for three-
hour in-flight Internet access (US$12.95 for over three hours) during each
flight, and will be offered on all of its domestic flights by next summer.</P>

      <P>The ruling Kuomintang (KMT) will dispatch two five- member delegations to the
Democratic National Convention (DNC) and Republican National Convention (RNC) in
the United States late August and early September, respectively, a senior party
official said Sunday.</P>
      <P>In a recent meeting, the KMT decided that Tseng Yun-chuan, deputy speaker of the
Legislative Yuan, will lead the delegation to the 2008 DNC to be held in Denver,
Colorado Aug. 25-28, while, Chiang Pin-kung, vice chairman of the KMT and
chairman of the Straits Exchange Foundation,  will head the delegation to the
RNC in Minneapolis-Saint Paul, Minnesota Sept. 1-4.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the U.S. party conventions is to officially nominate the party's
candidate for president and to adopt the party's platform and rules. Since
senators Barack Obama and John McCain have already locked up their candidacies
for the Democratic and Republican parties, respectively, the choices of their
running mates will be the focus of the conventions.</P>
      <P>A senior Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) official said that traditionally,
the ministry does not dispatch delegations to the U.S. party conventions,
although high-ranking officials of Taiwan's representative office to the U.S.
usually observe them.</P>
      <P>Legislators Ting Shou-chung, Chou Shou-hsun, Wu Chih-yang and Shuai Hua-ming are
members of the delegation to the DNC, while Pai Wei- kang, Tsai Cheng-yuan, Lai

      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan extended his congratulations Sunday to the mother of

earlier.</P>
      <P>In a phone call to Chen's mother Wu Hsiao-lin in Tainan City, the premier lauded
Chen for bringing glory to the country by winning bronze in the women's 48 kg-
class weightlifting event, the country's fourth Olympic weightlifting medal in
24 years.</P>
      <P>The premier  also instructed  his chief  of staff,  Hsieh Hsiang-chuan, to visit
Wu at her home later Sunday and present her with a medal for her daughter on his
behalf bearing the inscription "Gracing the Nation."</P>
      <P>Hsieh said Chen</P>
      <P>has boosted the morale of her teammates at the Beijing Olympics, and expressed
admiration for Wu, who brought up Chen and her two sisters alone.</P>
      <P>Showing off various medals her daughter has won, the proud mother told Hsieh she
has been overwhelmed with congratulatory phonecalls since her daughter won the
medal in Beijing.</P>
      <P>However, she said she is worried about her daughter's career as an athlete after
the Beijing Olympics and asked Hsieh to help Chen land a job, preferably as a
public school teacher rather than a sports coach, which is the only option for
most medal-winning athletes.</P>
      <P>Hsieh promised to help but did not elaborate on how he plans to do this.</P>
      <P>Wu Chun-cheh, secretary-general of the Sports Affairs Council who accompanied
Hsieh on the visit, said that as an Olympic medalist, Chen is qualified to coach
the national team but not to teach at school unless she completes teaching and
education courses at university to obtain teaching credentials.</P>
      <P>Chen is one of 80-odd members of the Taiwan Olympic team that is competing at

environment and agricultural achievements.</P>
      <P>"The countryside experience, emphasizing the interaction between humans and
nature, has become an emerging trend among local leisure activities," COA
Minister Chen Wu-hsiung said at the opening ceremony of the event.</P>
      <P>Due to this trend, a total of 2,000 slots open to children at the farm village
workshops were booked during the first 30 minutes of registration at the
beginning of this summer's vacation."The council will open up to 5,000 slots to
help more children get familiar with Mother Nature and farm villages in the next
year," Chen promised.</P>
      <P>He said the new initiative has integrated three different categories of venues
-- farm villages, national forest recreation areas and botanical gardens -- to
allow people to gain hands-on knowledge of ecosystems and farm development while
enjoying the "natural lifestyle."</P>
      <P>The COA program provides a passport that guides travelers to experience daily
life in any of 123 designated farm villages.</P>
      <P>In addition, it also arranges workshops in dozens of forest parks and botanical
gardens to accommodate summer vacationers in different locations around the
country.</P>
      <P>Chen said that by integrating the recreational resources of mountain  trails,
forest parks,  forestry culture centers and eco-educational parks, the council
will form a brand new holiday experience that pays respect to nature while
helping participants to improve their health through exercise.</P>
      <P>"The forests will become centers for nature education, " the minister
envisioned.</P>
      <P>Touching on the Taipei Botanical Garden, one of the event venues that is located
at the heart of the city but almost hidden in a bubble of tranquility, Chen said
the weekly tour guides in the garden will allow citizens to observe and learn
about over 2,000 plants.</P>
      <P>To preserve the natural resources, Chen warned the participants not to take away
any animals, plants or minerals.</P>

      <P>The Council of Agriculture (COA) , taking advantage of the Beijing Olympics to
market Taiwanese fruit in Beijing, is also working on an "order fruit in Taiwan
for delivery in China" campaign among Chinese tourists visiting Taiwan, a
council official said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The promotional efforts were highly commended by Premier Liu Chao-shiuan at a
recent Cabinet meeting in which he also ordered the Mainland Affairs Council to
work with the COA to expand the Chinese market for Taiwanese fruit, the official
said.</P>
      <P>Liu said the development of Taiwan's agriculture industry hinges on the
expansion of its international marketing network and added that to meet that
end, the COA should work with farmers and agricultural  groups to strengthen
the marketing of Taiwanese agricultural produce to Japan and the West.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's high quality fruit is world famous, but as the sales and distribution
channels are limited, it is common to see farmers struggle to make ends meet due
to plummeting prices caused by local gluts during harvest season,  according  to
COA Minister Chen Wu-hsiung, who added that it is unreasonable that good
harvests do not bring profits for farmers.</P>
      <P>Sometimes,  oversupplies  also occur when foreign countries abruptly suspend
imports of Taiwanese fruit, Chen went on, adding that to prevent this kind of
crisis, it is very important to establish additional marketing outlets.</P>
      <P>For those reasons, the COA has being targeting high-income consumers  in China
following  the opening of weekend  direct cross-strait charter flights and the
admission of more Chinese tourists to Taiwan last month, the official cited Chen
as saying.</P>
      <P>In the initial stage, the COA plans to set up service centers in the Sun Moon
Lake area and at Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport where Chinese visitors can
place fruit orders.</P>
      <P>The COA will also select center operators by the end of this year to deal with
matters concerning taking orders, promotion, exhibition, sales and quarantine,
while handling delivery issues in Beijing and Shanghai.</P>
      <P>For those chosen to run the service centers, the COA will provide subsidies to
help them set up the centers and assist them with negotiating and communicating
with local government agencies and airports to facilitate the operation and
promotion of their centers.</P>
      <P>Both Taiwanese and Chinese customers will be able to place orders at the centers
for fruit to be delivered to Chinese addresses, the official added.</P>
      <P>Some farmers in the central county of Nantou have expressed keen interest in the
proposal as they are confident it could help the county to sell its well known
plum and tea products. Sun Moon Lake is in Nantou County.</P>
      <P>Chen was cited as saying that if the plan goes smoothly, the COA will also
consider setting up distribution outlets in China in the future.</P>

      <P>Taipei urged Beijing to give visitors to China seeking to attend Olympic events
"reasonable respect" during the Beijing Olympics.</P>
      <P>In response to Beijing's denial of entry to a Taiwanese woman the previous day,
Government Information Office Minister Vanessa Yea-ping Shih said Sunday that
the Taipei authorities expressed their regret through the Sports Affairs Council
(SAC).</P>
      <P>The SAC said in a Saturday press release that the Beijing authorities had no
reason to deny entry to Yang Hui-ju, who traveled to Beijing with valid travel
documents with the purpose of cheering on the Chinese Taipei team at the
Olympics.</P>
      <P>Yang is known in Taiwan for profiting from benefits offered by local banks to

    <TEXT>
      <P>Ruling Kuomintang (KMT) lawmakers said Sunday that they oppose a Ministry of
Justice plan to phase out the death penalty, claiming that a lack of capital
punishment would increase the crime rate.</P>
      <P>The remarks came one day after the ministry said it plans to gradually achieve
its goal through conducting extensive research and discussion, and through
proposing complementary measures to win the support of the public.</P>
      <P>However, KMT Legislator Wu Ching-chih said it is not the right time to push for
eliminating the death penalty.</P>
      <P>He claimed that Taiwan's social order is not good and that people do not have
sufficient understanding of law and order.</P>
      <P>If the death penalty is abandoned, he went on, it will not be conducive to
social order and might encourage major crime rings to engage in bigger crimes.</P>
      <P>The existence of the death penalty serves as a warning to those who intend to
engage in illicit activities, according to Wu, who vowed that if the ministry
proposes a draft bill to abolish the death penalty in the next legislative
session, he will oppose it.</P>
      <P>Chu Fong-chi, another KMT lawmaker, shared the same view, adding that South
Africa now has no capital punishment, which she claimed is the reason its social
order is deteriorating.</P>
      <P>She suggested keeping the death penalty in place, but urged local judges to
exert more caution when handing down death sentences.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Lu Hsueh-chang said the ministry should respect public opinion,
since there is no consensus on the abolishment.</P>
      <P>A day earlier, the ministry said in a statement that capital punishment uses
national power to deprive a criminal's right to life so that the criminal is
isolated from the rest of the society permanently.</P>
      <P>According to the ministry, such methods are cruel and fail to demonstrate  that
punishments  should also serve rehabilitation purposes.</P>
      <P>Therefore, many democratic, advanced nations have abolished the death penalty
with or without conditions, it pointed out.</P>
      <P>Up to 137 countries have abandoned capital punishment both legally and in
reality, while 60 countries still maintain it, according to Amnesty
International data released in May.</P>
      <P>Only 24 of these 60 countries still carry out death sentences, the ministry
noted, adding that the United Nations General Assembly also endorsed a
resolution Dec. 18, 2007 to call for suspension of executions.</P>
      <P>Although abolishing the death penalty is a world trend, up to 80 percent of the
people in Taiwan oppose the idea, according to the results of a ministry poll
released in February.</P>
      <P>However, the percentage dropped sharply to 43 percent when the ministry asked
the respondents if they would agree that the death penalty should be replaced by
life imprisonment with no parole.</P>
      <P>Under such a premise,  another  56 percent supported  the abolishment of capital
punishment, the ministry said.</P>

      <P>The Taichung city government will listen to the opinions of local civic groups
and residents before making a final decision on whether to develop a "pet zone"
at the Jioushe Park in the central city by the end of this month, a city
government official said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The city government originally planned to allot a 1.8 hectare plot of land in
the four-hectare park where residents would be able to walk their dogs, but
decided to reassess the proposal after it drew criticism from local residents,
according to the official.</P>
      <P>As many locals have expressed opposition to the proposal, the government will
take their opinions into account and has already informed animal protection
groups of the situation and asked them to recommend alternative courses of
action.</P>
      <P>The official expressed hope that the groups will choose "an appropriate site"
that will not draw opposition from local residents. "It would also be best if
dog lovers themselves are willing to maintain the pet zone should it be
established."</P>
      <P>Residents near the city's Nantun Park expressed hope that the government can use
a 0.6 hectare plot of land in the park, which covers an area of 1.3 hectares,

      <P>More than 10 groups will discuss Monday how to establish a forum aimed at
"defending Taiwan's sovereignty" under what they describe as the "pro-China"
government.</P>
      <P>Shih Cheng-feng,  chairman  of the Institute  for National Development, one of
the organizing groups, accused the Kuomintang (KMT) government of downgrading
Taiwanese identity and of leaning toward China since it took office in May.</P>
      <P>The KMT's stance has intensified the political confrontations within Taiwan and
poses a crisis to Taiwan's sovereignty and diplomacy, according to Shih.</P>
      <P>He also blasted the government for opening direct charter flights between Taiwan
and China July 4 and for planning to allow Taiwanese wafer manufacturers to
invest in 12-inch wafer plants in China.</P>
      <P>He argued that these policies will benefit only China's economy, not that of
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Shih claimed that the Chinese communists are using political and economic means
to help reach the KMT's ultimate goal -- achieving unification with China.</P>
      <P>He said Beijing's ultimate purpose is to annex Taiwan and he urged people in
Taiwan to monitor the government.</P>
      <P>The establishment of the forum is to prevent Taiwan from being further isolated
in the international community following the Beijing Olympic Games, according to
Shih.</P>
      <P>The forum will also seek to prevent the Beijing authorities and the KMT from
collaborating to turn Taiwan into a part of China, he said.</P>

(COO), Ryan Wu said Monday at a press conference at which he announced the poll
results.</P>
      <P>In the poll, conducted between July 25 and August 7 among local 455 enterprises,
83.38 percent of the respondents indicated that they are more likely to offer
jobs to applicants who look relatively more attractive.</P>
      <P>Wu said that 50.95 percent of the respondents thought that good looks reflected
self-management ability, while 36.39 percent said an attractive employee can
help give the the company or its products a good image.</P>
      <P>According to the poll, 81.33 percent of employees think that clothes and make-up
contribute the most to a worker's physical appearance.</P>
      <P>With the job market in Taiwan becoming increasingly  more competitive,
recruiters have more choices in selecting ideal job candidates, with the option
of picking physically better looking people, Wu said.</P>
      <P>However, the advantage of good looks usually stops at the interview stage, as
employers still remain practical when it comes to offering salaries, he added.</P>
      <P>Nonetheless, 14.52 percent of the respondents in the poll admitted that they
would offer more attractive workers a starting salary 4.46 percent higher than
the standard pay.</P>
      <P>"Outstanding work performance still counts the most, " Wu stressed, adding that
job seekers who think they are not as attractive as others should not be
discouraged in their search.</P>
      <P>As for the types of positions seen most likely to be filled with physically good
looking people, 67.28 percent and 57.26 percent of the companies identified
salespersons and customer service staff, respectively.</P>
      <P>According to another job bank survey conducted among 1,176 local workers,
physical appearance is regarded as a big factor in finding employment and in
work evaluation. An overwhelming 95.83 percent of the respondents said they
thought good looks give an added advantage in job interviews.</P>
      <P>Fifty-six percent of those polled said better looking employees stand a higher
chance of having their performance noticed by the boss, while 47.45 percent said
attractive workers tend to get away with mistakes in their work.</P>
      <P>Employers, on the other hand, said they are less influenced by the looks when
evaluating job performances, as the first poll showed that only 17.68 percent of
respondents said they would provide good-looking employees with more
opportunities to showcase the quality of their work.</P>
      <P>The second poll, conducted between July 25 and August 7, had a margin of error
of plus or minus 2.9 percent anda 95 percent level of confidence.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Monday that building  a clean  government  is the
top  priority  of his administration, as the more honest and clean a government
is, the more competitive the country will be.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks at the opening ceremony of the 2008 International Anti-
corruption Conference in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"Anti-corruption is not only a global trend, but is also the number one task of
the government," Ma said.</P>
      <P>Ma said that apart from Transparency International's annual corruption
perceptions  index,  several world renowned surveys conducted by the World
Economic Forum in Geneva and the International Institute for Management
Development in Lausanne also take into consideration the integrity of
governments in assessing the national competitiveness of countries around the
world.</P>
      <P>"The more honest a government is, the more competitive the country is. They are
directly proportional to each other," he said.</P>
      <P>Ma contended that clean government cannot be achieved solely by instituting
strict laws, but also by public servants taking the attitude of "not wanting to
be corrupt, seeing no need to be corrupt" and that they "cannot be corrupt and
dare not be corrupt."</P>
      <P>"Those at the top have to set the example for those below to follow," the
president said. "Leaders have to have the political will to oppose corruption
and the society also needs to be on board."</P>
      <P>Ma said people might be disappointed at a government when the economy is
sluggish but they are devastated when a government proves corrupt.</P>
      <P>"Peoples trust is the most important asset a government can have, but corruption
is the strongest corrosive agent of such trust," he stated.</P>
      <P>Quoting the British historian John Baron, the president said, "Power corrupts,
absolute power corrupt absolutely, " adding that anti-corruption is a full-time
task that requires the efforts of everyone.</P>
      <P>The 2008 International Anti-corruption Conference is slated to be held in Taipei
from Aug. 11-13, with representatives from Denmark, Singapore, Australia,
Malaysia, Macao and Transparency International attending.</P>
      <P>During the sessions, the participants will exchanges views on strategies on
government ethics, fighting bribery, and corruption control in government,
business and the private sector.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Hsinchu Science Park's production reached NT$553.379 billion (US$17.742 billion)
for the first half of 2008, up 4.25 percent over the level for the same period
last year, the park's administration said Monday.</P>
      <P>The integrated circuit and optoelectronics industries accounted for 88.2 percent
of the park's production for the January-June period, according to the
administration.</P>
      <P>The production value of optoelectronics companies within the park amounted to
NT$103.03 billion, up 41.86 percent year-on-year, thanks to continued growth of
flat panel display manufacturers and individual optoelectronics giants, such as
AUO.</P>
      <P>The integrated circuit manufacturers' production value totaled N$385.064
billion, rising only 0.28 percent year-on-year largely due to the weak
performance of the DRAM industry, the administration said.</P>
      <P>Despite the overall increase in production, several industries in the park
experienced declines for the first half of the year, including the precision
machinery industry, down 2.97 percent to NT$5.604 billion, and the biotechnology
industry, down 6.83 percent to NT$1.669 billion.</P>
      <P>Randy Yen, director-general of the park's administration, said that although the
local economy and manufacturers continue to face challenges brought about by the
U.S. subprime crisis, high oil prices and global economic sluggishness, the
park's production is expected to increase in the second of half of this year as
the various high-tech industries within the park enter their high seasons.</P>
      <P>The park's production value is forecast to reach NT$1.198 trillion for this
year, which would represent an increase of 4.53 percent over the year-earlier
figure, according to Yen.</P>
      <P>He further said that the park, with its top quality facilities, has helped bring
about sustainable development for Taiwan's economy.</P>
      <P>Yen predicted that 500 companies will be established within the park by the year
2011, at which time the park's production is likely to reach the NT$1.5 trillion
mark.</P>
      <P>The Hsinchu Science Park, which was established by Taiwan's government in 1980,
is located in northern Hsinchu County, about 70 kilometers from Taipei City. A
total of 441 mainly high-technology companies have set up shop within the 883
hectare park to date, employing some 130,000 workers, according to the
administration.</P>

    <HEADLINE>New personnel reshuffle based on professionalism: MOFA</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Monday that professionalism and
ability were the main concerns behind the latest personnel reshuffle in
diplomatic posts and denied reports that the removal of Representative to
Bahrain Parris Chang has anything to do with his possession of a U.S. green
card.</P>
      <P>"Regarding political appointees, the two basic principles are first, that the
Foreign Ministry respects the will of the personnel concerned, and second, that
Foreign Minister Francisco H.L. Ou bases his overall evaluations on ability and
professionalism, " said MOFA spokesman Henry Chen in response to reporters'
questions.</P>
      <P>Since the Kuomintang (KMT) took office May 20, the issue of whether Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) political appointees should resign or be replaced has
become a controversial issue.</P>
      <P>Important positions such as representatives to the United States, Japan and the
European Union have all been replaced, or will be shortly,  a move that the
opposition DPP claims is political wrangling.</P>
      <P>The Foreign Ministry confirmed a day earlier that Chang, who took office in
January, has been removed from the post and that his successor will be Robert
Sa, former representative to Zaire and former deputy representative to France,
Belgium and the European Union.</P>
      <P>Chen insisted that Chang's removal is not personal and is not related to his
being in possession of a U.S. green card, saying that "our main consideration is
to put the most suitable people into the right positions, especially career
diplomats with expertise."</P>
      <P>The Central Personnel Administration (CPA) under the Executive Yuan recently
instructed representatives with permanent residency of foreign countries to
either renounce such status or resign. After being named by the CPA,
Representative to Japan Koh Se-kai and Representative to Switzerland Kuanping
George Liu tendered their resignations, leaving Chang the only one who did not
follow the directive.</P>
      <P>The Nationality Act forbids Republic of China nationals with foreign citizenship
from assuming public office and stipulates that those holding such status should
be removed from their posts. The Law, however, does not forbid public servants
from holding permanent residency of a foreign country.</P>
      <P>In other diplomatic changes, Ambassador to Palau Matthew Lee became director-
general  of the MOFA's Department of Protocol, effective Aug. 1, while the
vacancy he left will be filled by Maggie Tien, former director-general of the
Taipei Economic and Cultural Office (TECO) in Sydney.</P>
      <P>Representative to the Czech Republic Shen Ssu-tsun will assume the post of MOFA
secretary-general, while Raymond Wang, former director-general of the TECO in
Honolulu, was designated as the ministry's Congressional Liaison Unit
coordinator.</P>

      <P>The Taiwan government has donated US$600,000 to El Salvador for the construction
of small-scale irrigation systems in the Central American country, the
Salvadoran daily "La Prensa", which was obtained here, reported Sunday.</P>
      <P>The new irrigation systems, built in 250 areas in eastern El Salvador, are aimed
at helping small- and mid-scale fruit and vegetable growers in the region boost
productivity as well as at ensuring a stable source of water for their crops,
according to the report.</P>
      <P>Since 1972, Taiwan has continually supported a program to develop El Salvador's
agriculture and livestock industries, including assisting in setting up the
needed infrastructure. To date, irrigation systems have been built in more than
800 farming areas of the country, while 15 large-scale drainage systems have
been constructed.</P>
      <P>Republic of China Ambassador Carlos Liao recently presented the third
installment of the donation on behalf of the Taiwan government to Salvadoran
Agricultural Minister Mario Ernesto Salaverria, the report said.</P>
      <P>In accepting the donation, Salaverria said that Taiwan's assistance under
bilateral technological cooperation programs has not only helped boost the
productivity of local farmers, it has also reduced El Salvador's reliance on
foreign agricultural imports.</P>
      <P>He added that the program has included assisting Salvadoran farmers in
developing  the marketing and processing  of their agricultural products, and
expressed the hope that through this type of assistance, the country's "farmers
can become agricultural entrepreneurs."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The NT$500 limit set by the government on the value of gifts that public
servants are permitted to accept in the line of duty will remain in place,
despite some controversy over a NT$620 (US$20) gift bag planned by the Council
of Agriculture (COA) to promote Taiwanese fruit, Minister of Justice Wang Ching-
feng said Monday.</P>
      <P>"The Ministry of Justice is not considering raising the limit at present despite
the controversy," Wang asserted, adding that the rule could help the government
and officials save money.</P>
      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan has asked the heads of agencies when buying gifts to buy
locally grown flowers out of their own pockets to avoid contravening official
guidelines, Wang said.</P>
      <P>Wang made the remarks in response to a report in the China Times daily newspaper
earlier Monday that the COA had planned to present each government minister with
a gift bag containing four popular locally grown fruits -- guavas, mangoes,
pineapples and starfruit -- at last Thursday's weekly Executive Yuan meeting as
part of the COA's efforts to sell the fruits at home and abroad.</P>
      <P>But the COA was forced to abandon the plan after being told Wednesday night by
central ethics authorities that the value of the gift exceeded the NT$500
ceiling imposed by the government.</P>
      <P>According to the Ethics Directives for Civil Servants approved by the Executive
Yuan in June, public employees are permitted to accept gifts or social
hospitality that do not exceed the "standards of ordinary social etiquette" on
special occasions such as engagements, weddings, promotions, transfers and new
postings.</P>
      <P>COA Deputy Minister Hu Hsing-hua said the plan to offer the fruit bag as a gift
was not in violation of the Ethics Directives for Civil Servants because the
cost of the fruit itself was NT$500, while the basket cost NT$120.</P>
      <P>"It is a worldwide practice to give flowers or fruit on holidays and special
occasions, and it is natural to accept gifts of these kinds worth less than
NT$500," Hu quoted Liu as saying.</P>
      <P>"The fruit was to be presented in a gift bag as part of an advertising campaign
that was launched late last month in Beijing ahead of the ongoing Beijing
Olympics, " Hu said.</P>
      <P>The COA has been advertising the fruit at 30 stations in Beijing's metro system
to attract Chinese and foreign passengers and to help boost sales of the fruit
on the global market.</P>
      <P>"It takes time to promote Taiwan's high-end and pricey farm produce in the
Chinese market, and this is the reason why the COA filmed the advertisement to
court potential customers in the hope of setting up more distribution channels
in the future," Hu explained.</P>
      <P>Government Information Office Minister Vanessa Shih said Premier Liu firmly
supports Taiwan's agriculture and is deeply concerned about farmers'
livelihoods.</P>
      <P>The premier has asked all public agency chiefs to purchase flowers themselves
instead of accepting the gift bags from the COA, she said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The recent economic downturn is so severe and pervasive that the annual sale of
moon cakes by many charity organizations to raise funds has been receiving
lukewarm response.</P>
      <P>Minister of the Interior Liao Liou-yi has used recently public funds to produce
and broadcast a television advertisement to promote moon cakes made by mentally
challenged people.</P>
      <P>Liao said at a press conference yesterday that the sale of moon cakes by social
welfare organizations has fallen way below expectations this year, and that
concern for the underprivileged is always an important element of his policies.</P>
      <P>His observations on the drop in sales were confirmed by a spokesperson for one
such organization.</P>
      <P>According to Tsui Pin, director of the Eden Social Welfare Foundation's public
relations department, it is clear that charity organizations are having
difficulty promoting their hand-made moon cakes due to the economic slowdown.</P>
      <P>Tsui said in a telephone interview Monday that her foundation has set a target
of selling 15,000 moon cakes gift boxes this year made by about 40 physically
and mentally challenged people at three Eden shelter factories located in
northern and central Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"But at best, sales would total only 10,500 boxes (of moon cakes) this year, "
which means a big drop from last year's 25,000 boxes, said Tsui. She added that
because of the economic stagnation people are reluctant to help the charities.</P>
      <P>This year's Mid-Autumn Festival will fall on September 14. Tsui explained that
since it takes longer for the disabled to prepare the moon cakes, the orders
should be submitted at least one month in advance.</P>
      <P>However, to date, two of foundation's shelter factories have orders for only
about 2,000 boxes, Tsui said.</P>
      <P>Enterprises that customarily place orders every year have been relatively
conservative this year, and some of them have even told the foundation that they
have no funds to order moon cakes as they have made donations to survivors of
the May 12 Sichuan earthquake, said Tsui.</P>
      <P>She further noted that in addition  to the poor economic situation, there are
more social welfare organizations trying to get a piece of the shrinking pie by
selling moon cakes during the festival season.</P>
      <P>In order to promote sales, the Eden foundation is cooperating with the OK-Mart
convenience stores this year in the hope of making its hand-made moon cakes
available to a wider market, though that means the price will increase, Tsui
said.</P>
      <P>The Children Are Us Foundation, a social welfare organization that helps people
with Downs Syndrome fit into the society by providing them professional training
courses, has also forecast a drop in sales this year.</P>
      <P>Jalen Zou, chief of the foundation's public relations section, said its target
this year is 80 percent of last year's NT$20 million.</P>
      <P>People with Down Syndrome, dubbed "joyful and naive children" in Taiwan,
participated in the moon cake production process, including the making and
packing, Zou said.</P>

      <P>Nearly 2,800 physically and mentally disabled children aged under 12 have
benefited from free oral health care services provided by the southern county of
Kaohsiung from 2002 to 2007, a local official said Monday.</P>
      <P>According to the official of the Kaohsiung County Health Bureau, the county
government has spent over NT$2.7 million (US$86,581) on providing the service to
disabled children who cannot take good care of their teeth on their own.</P>
      <P>The subsidy program has helped cover dental examination fees for about 1,100
people and treatment charges for about 1,700, the official said.</P>
      <P>The service allows children who have a special dental health care "passport"
issued by the county government to receive full subsidies from the county
government to pay for examinations or treatment items that national health
insurance does not cover, including registration fees, charges for special
dental fillings, braces and fluoride treatment, the official said.</P>
      <P>A total of 67 oral health care institutes around the county have joined the
service network and have received training on how to provide dental care to
disabled children, who sometimes require more patience and care during treatment
procedures, the official said.</P>
      <P>In order to make people more aware of the importance of oral hygiene, the county
government also provides a free oral examination for each member of the general
public every year, the official added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan has achieved significant results in reducing drug-related harm and
lowering HIV prevalence among drug addicts, according to a report presented last
week at the 2008 International AIDS Conference in Mexico.</P>
      <P>The report, presented by National Yang Ming University and China Medical
University, assessed Taiwan's achievements in reducing HIV prevalence through a
harm reduction program,  including needle exchanges and methadone therapy.</P>
      <P>Harm reduction refers to any program or policy designed to reduce drug-related
harm without requiring the cessation of drug use. It represents a pragmatic
approach to managing drug addiction.</P>
      <P>According to the report, a research team collected 1,800 needles discarded by
drug addicts at 33 recovery points throughout Taiwan in March 2007 and another
1,800 used needles in July the same year in order to conduct blood residue
tests, leading to the finding that the HIV prevalence among drug addicts was
reduced by half -- from 18 percent to 9 percent.</P>
      <P>Chen Yi-ming, director of the AIDS Prevention and Research Center at Yang Ming
University in Taipei who serves concurrently as president of the Taiwan Harm
Reduction Association, told CNA in an interview Monday that Taiwan launched a
harm reduction pilot program in October 2005 after heroin addicts sharing
needles caused the HIV infection rate to double between 2004 and 2005.</P>
      <P>The success of the pilot program prompted the government to begin a full-scale
program in August 2006. By the end of 2007, the program had distributed 3.6
million sterilized syringes and needles at 60 exchange stations and had helped
more than 2,000 drug addicts to get onto methadone programs.</P>
      <P>According to Chen,  one of every five drug addicts newly imprisoned for
rehabilitation tested HIV-positive in 2005. Although the HIV infection rate has
now dropped to 4.3 percent, he estimated that of the 50,000 drug addicts not
currently in prison, about 10,000 are HIV carriers.</P>
      <P>"The challenge facing the government is that nearly 40,000 drug addicts are
still not participating in methadone programs and that most of them have not
been tested for AIDS recently," he said.</P>

      <P>A "cruise liner-style" railway train set off from the Hualien railway station
Monday carrying more than 300 passengers on a one-day special tour of the scenic
southeastern part of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The first tourism-oriented train of its kind was launched by the Taiwan Railways
Administration (TRA) as part of efforts to attract people to use TRA trains for
sightseeing.</P>
      <P>Unlike the usual trains that only stop for a short time at each station, the
"cruise train" makes longer stops at certain stations to allow passengers to
disembark and tour tourist spots, according to a TRA press release that
describes the way in which the train journey has been adapted to a form similar
to that of an international cruise liner.</P>
      <P>The train departed at 7: 30 a.m., making stops in Jian, Wanrong, Dongli and Fuli
before arriving in Taitung County's Guanshan just after noon.</P>
      <P>The train also ran at speeds as low as 35 kph to allow passengers good views of
the scenic landscapes and vast flower fields along the railway line that runs
through the East Rift Valley National Scenic Area.</P>
      <P>Hualien Railway Station Director Chen Yu-mou said the special train is a cheap
way to tour the scenic East Rift Valley, as the price of a ticket for a round-
trip tour between Hualien and Guanshan is only NT$332 for adults, NT$166 for
children and NT$184 for people aged over 65.</P>
      <P>The passengers on Monday's excursion had a three-hour stopover at Guanshan,
where they had the opportunity to do a round-the-town bike tour or visit a local
water park before boarding the same train for the return trip to Hualien, Chen
added.</P>
      <P>In addition to the Hualien-Taitung Line, the TRA has also prepared similar
cruise trains for the Taipei-Suao Line along the northeast coast and for the
Kaohsiung-Taitung South Link Line. The Suao cruise will depart Aug. 19 and Aug.
30 from Taipei, while the South Link Line train will run from Kaohsiung Aug. 23,
and Sept. 6, according to the TRA.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The recent depreciation of the New Taiwan dollar is likely to help the stock
market, as Taiwan's listed export firms will benefit from the change in exchange
rate, market experts said Monday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's currency dropped to NT$31.166 against the greenback at the close of
trade Monday, a fall of 0.24 percent. The NT dollar has dropped a total of 2.3
percent in the past ten trading days, down from NT$30.465 on July 29. Currency
market turnover surpassed US$900 million during the same period.</P>
      <P>Market analysts said a cheaper NT dollar will likely worsen inflation,
especially in prices of imported goods. But they said it will benefit exporters,
whose goods will be cheaper abroad, and so boost such firms' stock performance.</P>
      <P>A large portion  of local stocks  are in export-focused industries, such as the
electronics sector, which will do better with a lower NT dollar, " Wang Lee-
rong, director of the Chung-Hua Institution for Economic Research's (CIER)
center for economic research, said Monday.</P>
      <P>Following the 302.89-point, or 2.65 percent, rise in the Dow Jones Industrial
Average last Friday, Taiwan's stock index on Monday rose 116.58 points, or 1.61
percent, to 7325.62 points, on turnover of NT$135.37 billion (US$4.34 billion).</P>
      <P>Wang told the Central News Agency (CNA) that the NT dollar drop is mainly due to
the recent strength of the U.S. dollar in international currency markets.</P>
      <P>The downward trend in the local currency does not signal that foreign capital is
leaving the island, she noted, adding that the outlook of Taiwan's economy
remains positive.</P>
      <P>According to the Taiwan Stock Exchange Corporation (TSEC) , foreign investors
bought a total of NT$130.5 billion in stocks last week, recording net purchases
of NT$6.83 billion. That helped the index rise by 206.5 points, or nearly three
percent.</P>
      <P>Wang forecasted, however, that in the long term the NT dollar would be more
resilient against the U.S. dollar, because Taiwan's economy should continue to
outperform that of the U.S. entering 2009.</P>

      <P>Prosecutors,  their assistants and investigators  will need to obtain an
intermediate-  or above level-finance professionalism certificate if they want
to investigate economic criminal cases following the implementation of a new
system July 1, 2010, Ministry of Justice (MOJ) officials said Monday.</P>
      <P>The new finance professionalism certification system, initiated by former
Justice Minister Shih Mao-lin earlier this year, is aimed at upgrading the
quality of investigation and the conviction rates for economic criminal cases,
the officials said.</P>
      <P>According to the officials, the Investigation Bureau under the MOJ and the
Securities and Futures Institute have already cooperated in training 170
investigators around the country to investigate corporate corruption cases.
Cooperation with the Taiwan Academy of Banking and Finance and the Cabinet-level
Financial Supervisory Commission in offering courses to prosecutors is also
expected to be set up in September.</P>
      <P>Officials from the MOJ's Department of Prosecutorial Affairs said finance
courses at elementary, intermediate and high levels will be offered, with the
elementary level focusing on general finance through courses including an
introduction to the capital market, banking and stocks practice, company
internal control systems, and how to read financial statements.</P>
      <P>The intermediate level will emphasize investigation skills, with courses on how
to investigate stock market players, embezzlement, insider trading, illegal
income, related case studies, and finance checking.</P>
      <P>Courses at the high level will include exploration of the merging and
acquisition of finance enterprises, and the practice and crime strategies of
offshore companies.</P>
      <P>The officials added that the intermediate course will last for 48 hours, while
the elementary and high level courses will each be 24 hours. The lecturers will
be directors of banking and financial agencies or research institutions,
professors and prosecutors with experience in investigating significant economic
crimes.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors and investigators who pass the evaluations conducted at the end of
the courses will be awarded a certificate by the MOJ and the Investigation
Bureau, the officials said, adding that they will also be awarded a certificate
if they attend the courses offered by financial units such as the Financial
Supervisory Commission and the Securities and Futures Institute.</P>
      <P>According to the officials, July 2008 through June 2010 will be a two-year
buffer period to allow for full preparations to be made prior to the
introduction of the new system.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's Lu Yen-hsun secured perhaps the most significant  victory of his career
Monday,  stunning the sixth-seeded Andy Murray of Scotland in the first round of
the Olympic men's singles tennis tournament 7-6 (5), 6-4.</P>
      <P>Lu, ranked 77th in the latest ATP rankings, broke Murray in the final game of
the second set to secure the victory, his first against a top-20 player since he
beat the third-ranked Guillermo Coria at a Wimbledon warm-up event in June 2004.</P>
      <P>The 25-year-old, who has battled injuries throughout his career but appears to
be healthy now, fought back from two breaks in the first set to win it in a
tiebreaker when Murray double-faulted on set point.</P>
      <P>After a rain delay early in the second set, Lu gained confidence and held off
four break points in the pivotal ninth game before breaking the Scot to clinch
the match.</P>
      <P>Murray was seen as one of the hottest players on the ATP Tour after winning the
ATP Masters Series event in Cincinnati last week, but made too many unforced
errors and was kept on the run by an inspired Lu.</P>
      <P>The surprising victory sent Lu into the second round of the tournament  against
clay-court  specialist  Agustin Calleri of Argentina, ranked 52nd in the world.</P>
      <P>To the regret of Taiwan's tennis fans, the match was not televised live by any
of the television stations with broadcasting rights to the Olympic Games.</P>
      <P>Two networks,  Taiwan's China Television  System and China Television Co.,
broadcast images from the last few games of the match on small screens that left
the players barely visible during their nightly newscast, but completely missed
Lu's match point while reporting other news stories.</P>
      <P>In an match that concluded just minutes before Lu's victory, and was also not
broadcast, Taiwan's Chan Yung-jan lost in the first round of the women's singles

      <P>Tainan County Magistrate Su Huan-chih called Monday for the central government
to boost its efforts to help Taiwan's fruit farmers tap U.S. and European
markets, since they are having difficulties breaking into China's market.</P>
      <P>Su urged the government to craft an agricultural policy to help Taiwanese
farmers to upgrade and create more value-added products, instead of harboring
wishful thinking about the Chinese market.</P>
      <P>The central government and most local authorities have stepped up their efforts
in recent months to help Taiwan's farmers ship fruits and vegetables to China.
But Su said he believes that Taiwan's farm goods exports to China were still
lackluster.</P>
      <P>In a bid to help local farmers break into overseas markets, in recent years the
southern Tainan County has set its sights on the Japanese and South Korean
markets, Su said. He added that the initial results had been satisfactory.</P>
      <P>According to the Tainan magistrate, last year his county shipped 786 metric tons
of mangoes to Japan, 741 metric tons to South Korea and only 81 metric tons to
China.</P>
      <P>So far this year, the county has exported over 850 metric tons of the fruit to
Japan and more than 500 metric tons to South Korea, boosting local farmers'
profits. The Directorate General of Customs has not yet published the figure for
exports to China.</P>
      <P>As the Chinese market for Taiwan's agricultural products remains small, the
central government has the obligation to explore other foreign markets on behalf
of local growers' interests, he said.</P>
      <P>According to Su, Taiwanese farm products are facing several critical
difficulties in the Chinese market, such as commercial piracy and fierce
competition from low-priced goods. He said that the root problem is a lack of
protection for Taiwan's business interests in China.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou reiterated Taiwan's firm desire to buy defensive weapons
from the United States to a visiting U.S. congressional delegation Monday, the
country's latest attempt to ease Washington's concerns over a pending arms deal.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks after media reports recently quoted a ruling Kuomintang
(KMT) lawmaker as saying after a visit to the U.S. Congress that the U.S. is
highly suspicious of Ma's stance on the weapons deal.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lin Yu-fang disclosed on July 31 that the U.S. suspicion stems from
Ma's recent efforts to repair relations with China, which claims sovereignty
over self-ruled Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Ma's administration opened Taiwan to direct weekend charter flights from China
and more Chinese tourists from July 4. The president also plans to allow
Taiwanese chipmakers to relocate 12-inch wafer plants to China.</P>
      <P>Ma told the delegation at the Presidential Office, however, that Taiwan's moves
to thaw ties with China will not affect Taiwan's weapons procurement from the
U.S.</P>
      <P>Taiwan had submitted a procurement list to the U.S. as early as last year, Ma
said, adding that he hopes the U.S. would soon begin the necessary legal
procedures to push for passage of the US$11 billion arms deal, that includes
Patriot PAC-III missile batteries, Apache and Black Hawk helicopters, and diesel
electric submarines.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Ma said Taiwan needs to demonstrate the will to defend itself and
that its defense budget will be maintained at no less than 3 percent of the
country's GDP.</P>
      <P>China deploys more than 1,000 missiles targeting Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Ma also said that since he took office on May 20,  his administration has been
working to improve ties with the U.S.</P>
      <P>He continued that Taipei's efforts to improve ties with Beijing marks another
important step in Taipei's efforts to warm up ties with the U.S.</P>
      <P>He said the confrontational positions between Taiwan and China in the past have
also affected Taiwan-U.S. relations and cited U.S. President George W. Bush as
publicly noting previously that he was pleased to see an improvement in the
cross-Taiwan Strait relations.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Ma said that he rarely saw such a large-scale U.S. congressional
delegation visit Taiwan in recent years and that many members of the delegation
were visiting Taiwan for the first time.</P>
      <P>He said he believes the delegation from the U.S. Congress' Committee on
Transportation and Infrastructure will help the congress better understand
Taiwan and looks forward  to meeting  more congressional delegations in the

    <HEADLINE>Gains made in minimizing nuclear waste: official</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan has made considerable gains in minimizing low-level radioactive waste
thanks to advanced technology and related regulations, but the selection of a
storage site remains unsettled, an official of the Cabinet-level Atomic Energy
Council (AEC) said Monday.</P>
      <P>According to Huang Ching-tsun, director of the AEC's Radioactive Waste
Management Bureau, Taiwan's three nuclear power plants have decreased the volume
of their solidified nuclear waste with a high efficiency solidification
technology developed by the AEC's Institute of Nuclear Energy Research.</P>
      <P>The three nuclear plants produced 259 drums of nuclear waste last year, only 2.1
percent of the record-high 12,258 drums produced in 1983, Huang said.</P>
      <P>Policies on minimizing nuclear waste volume set up by the AEC in 1989 and the
Nuclear Materials and Radioactive Waste Management Act implemented in 2002 both
contributed to the achievement.</P>
      <P>Huang emphasized that Taiwan's nuclear waste volume surpassed the world's
average in the 1970s and early 1980s during the early stages of its nuclear
power plants' operations, but said the country had gained a leading position in
the world in terms of nuclear waste reduction in recent years.</P>
      <P>Despite the progress, the selection of a nuclear waste storage site that has
been under debate since 1990, has yet to be made, Huang said.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, a site selection task force under the Ministry of Economic Affairs
is expected to announce a list of possible sites before the expiration of its
mandate expires in late August.</P>
      <P>Taiwan began to develop nuclear power in the 1970s and now operates three
nuclear power plants, with a fourth expected to begin operating next year.</P>
      <P>A total of 97,672 barrels of low-radiation waste produced before 1996 were
stored in 23 trenches on Orchid Island, also known as Lanyu, an island off the
southern coast of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The site stopped accepting additional nuclear waste in 1996 due to protests by
local residents, and all waste generated since then has been stored at the power
plants themselves.</P>
      <P>The situation has caused a headache for successive governments, unable to find a
permanent storage spot for the waste.</P>

      <P>All wood packaging materials used for imported goods into Taiwan beginning Jan.
1,  2009,  must be accompanied with certificates to prove that they have been
fumigated or heat-treated, quarantine authorities announced Monday.</P>
      <P>The Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection and Quarantine under the
Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture said that the new measure will be enforced
to prevent various vermin from entering into Taiwan, such as Anoplophora
glabripennis -- a beetle from China that has already been found in the United
States and has become a threat to hardwood trees, with no natural predators.</P>
      <P>The bureau said that from now until the end of this year, its officials at ports
of entry around Taiwan will use written notices to inform importers about their
noncompliance with the new regulation, but will not take further action.</P>
      <P>The bureau added, however, that from Jan. 1 next year, any imported  goods
whose wood packaging  materials  do not have certificates of fumigation or heat
treatment will be destroyed or sent back along with the imported goods to the
country of origin.</P>
      <P>Previously Taiwan had no regulations regarding the submission of fumigation
certificates for wood materials used for packaging import goods. It only
required such certificates when wooden cases or crates were shipped into Taiwan
as import items.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Two Chinese men nabbed off Kinmen Island</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Two Chinese smugglers were separately detained Monday off the coast of Kinmen
Island while attempting to sneak onto the Taiwan-controlled island county, the
Coast Guard Administration (CGA) said.</P>
      <P>It was the first time that two cases of illegal Chinese intruders were tracked
down in a single day by Kinmen authorities, CGA officers said, adding that an
initial probe produced no evidence linking the two men together.</P>
      <P>According to an initial investigation by CGA agents, Jia Wei, a 40-year-old
ethnic Chinese man from Xinjiang Province in western China, was arrested by
officers on patrol after he landed on the island's beach around 6 a.m.</P>
      <P>Jia told Coast Guard officers that he was aware of President Ma Ying-jeou's plan
to visit Kinmen Island on Aug. 23, and that he had traveled to Xiamen in Fujian
province Aug. 9 from Xinjiang.</P>
      <P>Kinmen lies just off Fujian's coast.</P>
      <P>Jia said he swam nearly eight hours from Xiamen to Kinmen in the hope of meeting
Ma and asking him to provide assistance for his family, which he claimed was
suppressed by Chinese communists in Xinjiang.</P>
      <P>At the time of his arrest, the officers found Jia in possession of a People's
Republic of China ID card, two cash notes of one Chinese yuan and a knife.</P>
      <P>The Coast Guard's Kinmen branch has initially ruled out any links between Jia
and Xinjiang's independence movement.</P>
      <P>Later the same day around 11: 05 a.m., soldiers stationed on a small islet off
Kinmen's main island arrested another Chinese man who had sneaked into the area.</P>
      <P>The 49-year-old man, identified as Yu Shuirong, is from central coastal Zhejiang
Province.</P>
      <P>Yu told Coast Guard officers that he wanted to look for a job in Taiwan and
decided to swim to Kinmen from Xiamen, where he said he had been unable to find
work.</P>
      <P>The two Chinese men have been handed over to the Kinmen Prosecutors Office for
further investigation on charges of breaching the National Security Law, the
Statute Governing the Relations Between the People of the Taiwan Area and the
Mainland Area and other relevant laws.</P>
      <P>According to the Coast Guard's patrol unit on Kinmen, the island's  law
enforcement  authorities  have caught 20 illegal immigrants there during the
period from January last year until the end of July this year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>President to hold talks with allies' heads of state during visit</HEADLINE>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou will hold talks with presidents of Taiwan's diplomatic
allies during his eight-day state visit, which will start Tuesday, an official
said Monday.</P>
      <P>The state visit will be Ma's first since he took office in May.</P>
      <P>Ma will lead a 80-member delegation to attend presidential inaugurations in
Paraguay and the Dominican Republic, two of the 23 countries that recognize
Taiwan diplomatically,  Deputy Foreign Ministry Javier Ho said at a press
conference at the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>Ma will stop over in Panama to refuel, ministry officials explained separately
after the news conference, adding that during his brief stay at the airport, Ma
will meet with his Panamanian counterpart, Martin Torrijos.</P>
      <P>In Paraguay, Ma will meet Paraguayan President-elect Fernando Lugo and outgoing
President Nicanor Duarte, the officials said, adding that he will also have a
discussion with Honduran President Manuel Zelaya.</P>
      <P>In the Dominican Republic,  Ma will hold talks with both Salvadoran President
Elias Antonio Saca and Haitian President Rene Preval.</P>
      <P>The officials added that Ma will also interact with U.S. Commerce Secretary
Carlos M. Gutierrez and former Congressman Rob Portman, who have been designated
by U.S. President George W. Bush as special envoys for the two presidential
inaugurations.</P>
      <P>At the press conference earlier in the day, Ho said that Ma is not considering
proposing any new foreign aid and that if Taiwan's allies propose any plan, Ma
will bring it home for further study and respond within the government's
ability.</P>
      <P>During the election campaign earlier this year, Ma had vowed not to engage in
"dollar diplomacy" if elected.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and China often use financial aid in a diplomatic war between the both
sides. China claims sovereignty over self-ruled Taiwan and has been working to
isolate Taiwan from the international community over the years.</P>
      <P>Responding to Lugo's vow made during the election campaign that he would not
rule out the possibility of developing a relationship with China, Ho said that
Lugo did not specify what kind of relationship it would be.</P>
      <P>Also, Ho said that Taiwan's embassy in Paraguay has contacted Lugo over the
matter several times and that there will not be a change in Taiwan-Paraguay
relations.</P>
      <P>During the state visit, Ma will make stopovers in Los Angeles and San Francisco,
where he is expected to meet some "U.S. friends, " Ho said.</P>
      <P>"Some of the friends are officials now, " Ho said, adding that U.S. congressmen
are included. He declined, however, to reveal more details.</P>
      <P>Despite the meetings, Ma has previously said that he will make low-profile U.S.
stopovers as part of efforts to repair relations between the two sides.</P>
      <P>Ma accused his predecessor, Chen Shui-bian, of capitalizing on U.S. transits to
strengthen his political support at home.</P>
      <P>Ma's visit is aimed at consolidating ties between Taiwan and its diplomatic
allies, visiting Taiwanese expatriates in central and south America, and raising
the morale of Taiwan's overseas diplomatic officials, according to Ho.</P>
      <P>Ma is slated to arrive in Taiwan on Aug. 19.</P>

    <HEADLINE>High calories, sodium found in lunch boxes at convenience stores</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 11 (CNA)
08/11/08  23:17:23
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A recent examination of lunch boxes sold at convenience stores discovered that
they contain a high level of calories and sodium that exceeded recommended
amounts.</P>
      <P>The  Taipei-based  Consumers'  Foundation,  an  independent organization devoted
to safeguarding consumers' rights, held a press conference Monday to make public
the results of its random survey in June of lunch boxes at 7-Eleven, FamilyMart,
Hi-Life and OK stores in Taipei city and county.</P>
      <P>The fast food lunches were checked for nutrition, nitrates, artificial coloring
and preservatives, as well as the packaging.</P>
      <P>A total of 18 lunch box samples were randomly collected, with each sold at a
price between NT$50-NT$70.</P>
      <P>The foundation pointed out that in only one of the samples did carbohydrates
have a share of the food's total calories within the recommended level listed in
the "the Republic of China Diet Manual, " published by the Executive Yuan's
Department of Health (DOH).</P>
      <P>The manual suggests carbohydrates should account for between 58 percent and 63
percent of one's daily caloric intake, protein 10-14 percent, and fat 20-30
percent.</P>
      <P>Protein accounted for more than 14 percent of 10 of the lunches' calories, while
fat exceeded the 30 percent limit in 12 of the samples, the foundation stated in
its report detailing the survey's results.</P>
      <P>The report also took the DOH's daily dietary guidelines as a reference, which
suggest 3-6 servings of rice, cereal, bread and rootstock vegetables; 1-2
servings of milk or milk products, four servings of eggs, meats, fish and
soybean products; three servings of leafy vegetables; two servings of fruit and
2-3 servings of fat.</P>
      <P>Only one of the 12 packaged lunches was found to contain more vegetables than
the suggested intake, while none of them included fruit or milk products,
according to the report.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the foundation's dietician also found that 12 of the 18 sample lunch
boxes contained more than 1,000 mg of sodium, nearly half the maximum
recommended daily intake of 2,400 mg, the report said.</P>
      <P>One sample -- the "Kuo Min Bien Tang" -- was found to contain 2,184 mg of
sodium, a substance that affects the body's metabolic balance.</P>
      <P>As a result, the foundation suggested that those who eat lunch boxes on a daily
basis should supplement their diets with milk or milk products and fresh fruit
while cutting down on the consumption of foods like meat, eggs, soybean
products, cereal, rice, and bread.</P>
      <P>The foundation did not discover the products to contain irregular amounts of
artificial additives but said the plastic sheet packed in 15 of the sample lunch
boxes was a safety concern.</P>
      <P>Lunch box makers contend, however, that the plastic is used as "heat insulation"
to prevent the packaging from changing shape while being microwaved.</P>
      <P>If that is the reason for the plastic, it is hard to convince consumers that the
lunch boxes are microwave-proof, the foundation said, adding that the survey
showed there's still plenty of room for lunch box vendors to improve their
products.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Tennis player's shocker takes sting off archers' setback</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 11 (CNA)
08/11/08  23:34:23
(By Luke Sabatier)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Monday was supposed to be a medal winning day for Taiwan at the Beijing
Olympics.</P>
      <P>Instead, it produced one of the greatest upsets ever pulled off by a local
athlete, referred to in one wire service headline as an "unknown Taiwanese."</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Lu Yen-hsun secured perhaps the most significant victory of his career
Monday, stunning the sixth-seeded Andy Murray of Scotland in the first round of
the Olympic men's singles tennis tournament 7-6 (5), 6-4.</P>
      <P>It was the first time a Taiwanese player had won a men's single match at the
Olympics and even Lu couldn't hide his surprise over defeating one of the
world's best players.</P>
      <P>"When I saw the draw and was preparing to board the plane for Beijing, I thought
about grabbing my bags and heading back home, " said a joking Lu, who had not
practiced intensively for the past week because of recurring back pain.</P>
      <P>"I actually wasn't fully prepared, so I'm really satisfied at producing such a
result," he said.</P>
      <P>Lu, ranked 77th in the latest ATP rankings, broke Murray in the final game of
the second set to secure the victory, his first against a top-20 player since he
beat the third-ranked Guillermo Coria at a Wimbledon warm-up event in June 2004.</P>
      <P>The 25-year-old fought back from two breaks in the first set to win it in a
tiebreaker when Murray double-faulted on set point.</P>
      <P>After temporarily losing his momentum after a rain delay early in the second
set, Lu regained his confidence and staved off four break points in the pivotal
ninth game before breaking the Scot to clinch the match.</P>
      <P>Lu, who lost in the first round of the men's singles at the 2004 Athens Games,
will face clay-court specialist Agustin Calleri of Argentina, ranked 52nd in the
world, in the second round of the 64-player tournament.</P>
      <P>In a match that concluded just minutes before Lu's victory, Taiwan's Chan Yung-
jan lost in the first round of the women's singles to eighth-seeded Agnieszka
Radwanska of Poland 6-1, 7-6 (6).</P>
      <P>While Lu shined, the men's archery team, winner of a silver medal in Athens in
2004 and one of world's top-ranked teams, disappointed.</P>
      <P>One of Taiwan's best bets for a medal in Beijing, the three archers could not
shake off their inconsistency or lack of confidence and were eliminated in the
quarterfinals of the 12-team tournament by Ukraine, 214-211.</P>
      <P>In truth, however, Taiwan's archers beat themselves. In an earlier round of 16
match, Taiwan outscored the United States 222 to 218, hitting 12 10's out of its
24 arrows and consistently have scored at least 220 in practice sessions.</P>
      <P>Not Monday.</P>
      <P>"We were never confident enough during the match and we had trouble lifting our
morale, " said a disappointed Chen Szu-yuan, one of the two members of the
Athens silver-mdeal winning team competing in Beijing.</P>
      <P>"Technically, we were fine, but the arrows were going right or going left, and
as hard as we tried to adjust, we weren't accurate."</P>
      <P>Taiwan actually narrowed a four-point deficit to one with three arrows left,
seemingly on the verge of an improbable comeback, but managed only three eights
with their final shots to hand victory to the Ukrainians.</P>
      <P>The result followed a similar disappointment by the women's archery team on
Sunday. Having qualified eighth out of 10 teams on Saturday, the women were
unlikely to medal with the prospects of facing the unbeatable South Koreans in
the quarterfinals.</P>
      <P>But even before reaching that stage, the team that captured bronze in Athens
fell to Italy 215-211 in misty conditions and placed ninth in the event.</P>
      <P>In other events Monday,  Hsieh Yu-hsing, competing in the badminton men's
singles, advanced to the round of 16 with a 21-16, 15-21, 21- 15 victory over
Nguyen Tien Minh of Vietnam and will next play Wong Choong Hann of Malaysia, who
upset Taufik Hidayat of Indonesia.</P>
      <P>But the women's doubles pairing of Cheng Wen-hsing and Chien Yu-chin was ousted
in the quarterfinals by third seeds Wei Yili and Zhang Yawen of China, 21-14,
21-18.</P>
      <P>Although swimming is one of Taiwan's weakest events,  Hsu Chih-chieh reached the
final 16 in the 200-meter butterfly, becoming the first male swimmer from Taiwan
to reach the final 16 in any Olympic swimming event.</P>
      <P>While the athletes were competing, local television stations were under fire for
Olympic coverage that often defied logic, cutting off events before their
conclusion and showing few events live.</P>
      <P>In fairness, the Taipei-Ukraine archery match was broadcast live, but Taiwan's
tennis fans were not able to see Lu's stunning victory.</P>
      <P>Two networks,  Taiwan's China Television  System and China Television Co.,
broadcast images from the last few games of the match on small screens that left
the players barely visible during their nightly newscast, but completely missed
Lu's match point while reporting other news stories.</P>
      <P>CTS showed a replay of the match later in the evening.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.N. initiative to be 'measured, not provocative': MOFA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  11  (CNA)
08/11/08  23:40:12
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government will adopt a gentle, flexible and pragmatic  approach toward the
country's bid for representation in the United Nations this year, a Ministry of
Foreign Affairs (MOFA) official said Monday.</P>
      <P>"The wording of our U.N. initiative will be measured and not provocative this
year, focusing on urging the world to heed the issue of Taiwan's lack of
representation in the world body, " said the official who preferred anonymity.</P>
      <P>Revealing that the MOFA is communicating with the United States and Taiwan's
diplomatic allies about technical details regarding the initiative, the official
said the MOFA is scheduled to brief the public on this year's U.N. proposal Aug.
15.</P>
      <P>Taiwan, as the Republic of China, lost its U.N. seat to the People's Republic of
China in 1971, and has made unsuccessful bids annually to rejoin the body since
1993.</P>
      <P>Under  the  previous  Democratic  Progressive  Party  (DPP) administration, the
country applied to join the United Nations in the name of Taiwan for the first
time last year, drawing criticism not only from China but also the United States
-- Taiwan's most important security partner -- as the move implied Taiwan was
seeking formal independence.</P>
      <P>With tentions  across the Taiwan Strait thawing since the inauguration of
President Ma Ying-jeou of the Kuomintang (KMT) in May, the MOFA official said
this year's proposal would not use the word "join" because it would imply that
Taiwan is seeking U.N. membership as a new nation, similar to the DPP
administration's bid last year.</P>
      <P>"Nor will we use the word 'rejoin' because it would imply that we would vie with
Beijing for the 'China' seat in the U.N., " the official explained.</P>
      <P>The avoidance of the words "join" and "rejoin" is also mandated by the fact that
neither of the DPP-initiated referendum on "joining" the U.N. as "Taiwan" and
the KMT-initiated referendum on "rejoining" the U.N. under any suitable name
garnered enough votes to make them valid in the votes held alongside the March
22 presidential poll, the official added.</P>
      <P>Although the current law stipulates that a failed referendum cannot be raised
again for three years, the official said the government will definitely ask
Taiwan's diplomatic allies to bring up the country's U.N. representation issue
at this year's General Assembly session scheduled to open in mid-September.</P>

where he is expected to meet some "U.S. friends, " Ho said.</P>
      <P>"Some of the friends are officials now, " Ho said, adding that U.S. congressmen
are included. He declined, however, to reveal more details.</P>
      <P>Despite the meetings, Ma has previously said that he will make low-profile U.S.
stopovers as part of efforts to repair relations between the two sides.</P>
      <P>Ma accused his predecessor, Chen Shui-bian, of capitalizing on U.S. transits to
strengthen his political support at home.</P>
      <P>Ma's visit is aimed at consolidating ties between Taiwan and its diplomatic
allies, visiting Taiwanese expatriates in central and south America, and raising
the morale of Taiwan's overseas diplomatic officials, according to Ho.</P>
      <P>Ma is slated to arrive in Taiwan on Aug. 19.</P>

    <HEADLINE>High calories, sodium found in lunch boxes at convenience stores</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 11 (CNA)
08/12/08  11:26:04
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A recent examination of lunch boxes sold at convenience stores discovered that
they contain a high level of calories and sodium that exceeded recommended
amounts.</P>
      <P>The  Taipei-based  Consumers'  Foundation,  an  independent organization devoted
to safeguarding consumers' rights, held a press conference Monday to make public
the results of its random survey in June of lunch boxes at 7-Eleven, FamilyMart,
Hi-Life and OK stores in Taipei city and county.</P>
      <P>The fast food lunches were checked for nutrition, nitrates, artificial coloring
and preservatives, as well as the packaging.</P>
      <P>A total of 18 lunch box samples were randomly collected, with each sold at a
price between NT$50-NT$70.</P>
      <P>The foundation pointed out that in only one of the samples did carbohydrates
have a share of the food's total calories within the recommended level listed in
the "the Republic of China Diet Manual, " published by the Executive Yuan's
Department of Health (DOH).</P>
      <P>The manual suggests carbohydrates should account for between 58 percent and 63
percent of one's daily caloric intake, protein 10-14 percent, and fat 20-30
percent.</P>
      <P>Protein accounted for more than 14 percent of 10 of the lunches' calories, while
fat exceeded the 30 percent limit in 12 of the samples, the foundation stated in
its report detailing the survey's results.</P>
      <P>The report also took the DOH's daily dietary guidelines as a reference, which
suggest 3-6 servings of rice, cereal, bread and rootstock vegetables; 1-2
servings of milk or milk products, four servings of eggs, meats, fish and
soybean products; three servings of leafy vegetables; two servings of fruit and
2-3 servings of fat.</P>
      <P>Only one of the 12 packaged lunches was found to contain more vegetables than
the suggested intake, while none of them included fruit or milk products,
according to the report.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the foundation's dietician also found that 12 of the 18 sample lunch
boxes contained more than 1,000 mg of sodium, nearly half the maximum
recommended daily intake of 2,400 mg, the report said.</P>
      <P>One sample -- the "Kuo Min Bien Tang" -- was found to contain 2,184 mg of
sodium, a substance that affects the body's metabolic balance.</P>
      <P>As a result, the foundation suggested that those who eat lunch boxes on a daily
basis should supplement their diets with milk or milk products and fresh fruit
while cutting down on the consumption of foods like meat, eggs, soybean
products, cereal, rice, and bread.</P>
      <P>The foundation did not discover the products to contain irregular amounts of
artificial additives but said the plastic sheet packed in 15 of the sample lunch
boxes was a safety concern.</P>
      <P>Lunch box makers contend, however, that the plastic is used as "heat insulation"
to prevent the packaging from changing shape while being microwaved.</P>
      <P>If that is the reason for the plastic, it is hard to convince consumers that the
lunch boxes are microwave-proof, the foundation said, adding that the survey
showed there's still plenty of room for lunch box vendors to improve their
products.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Tennis player's shocker takes sting off archers' setback</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 11 (CNA)
08/12/08  11:26:56
(By Luke Sabatier)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Monday was supposed to be a medal winning day for Taiwan at the Beijing
Olympics.</P>
      <P>Instead, it produced one of the greatest upsets ever pulled off by a local
athlete, referred to in one wire service headline as an "unknown Taiwanese."</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Lu Yen-hsun secured perhaps the most significant victory of his career
Monday, stunning the sixth-seeded Andy Murray of Scotland in the first round of
the Olympic men's singles tennis tournament 7-6 (5), 6-4.</P>
      <P>It was the first time a Taiwanese player had won a men's single match at the
Olympics and even Lu couldn't hide his surprise over defeating one of the
world's best players.</P>
      <P>"When I saw the draw and was preparing to board the plane for Beijing, I thought
about grabbing my bags and heading back home, " said a joking Lu, who had not
practiced intensively for the past week because of recurring back pain.</P>
      <P>"I actually wasn't fully prepared, so I'm really satisfied at producing such a
result," he said.</P>
      <P>Lu, ranked 77th in the latest ATP rankings, broke Murray in the final game of
the second set to secure the victory, his first against a top-20 player since he
beat the third-ranked Guillermo Coria at a Wimbledon warm-up event in June 2004.</P>
      <P>The 25-year-old fought back from two breaks in the first set to win it in a
tiebreaker when Murray double-faulted on set point.</P>
      <P>After temporarily losing his momentum after a rain delay early in the second
set, Lu regained his confidence and staved off four break points in the pivotal
ninth game before breaking the Scot to clinch the match.</P>
      <P>Lu, who lost in the first round of the men's singles at the 2004 Athens Games,
will face clay-court specialist Agustin Calleri of Argentina, ranked 52nd in the
world, in the second round of the 64-player tournament.</P>
      <P>In a match that concluded just minutes before Lu's victory, Taiwan's Chan Yung-
jan lost in the first round of the women's singles to eighth-seeded Agnieszka
Radwanska of Poland 6-1, 7-6 (6).</P>
      <P>While Lu shined, the men's archery team, winner of a silver medal in Athens in
2004 and one of world's top-ranked teams, disappointed.</P>
      <P>One of Taiwan's best bets for a medal in Beijing, the three archers could not
shake off their inconsistency or lack of confidence and were eliminated in the
quarterfinals of the 12-team tournament by Ukraine, 214-211.</P>
      <P>In truth, however, Taiwan's archers beat themselves. In an earlier round of 16
match, Taiwan outscored the United States 222 to 218, hitting 12 10's out of its
24 arrows and consistently have scored at least 220 in practice sessions.</P>
      <P>Not Monday.</P>
      <P>"We were never confident enough during the match and we had trouble lifting our
morale, " said a disappointed Chen Szu-yuan, one of the two members of the
Athens silver-mdeal winning team competing in Beijing.</P>
      <P>"Technically, we were fine, but the arrows were going right or going left, and
as hard as we tried to adjust, we weren't accurate."</P>
      <P>Taiwan actually narrowed a four-point deficit to one with three arrows left,
seemingly on the verge of an improbable comeback, but managed only three eights
with their final shots to hand victory to the Ukrainians.</P>
      <P>The result followed a similar disappointment by the women's archery team on
Sunday. Having qualified eighth out of 10 teams on Saturday, the women were
unlikely to medal with the prospects of facing the unbeatable South Koreans in
the quarterfinals.</P>
      <P>But even before reaching that stage, the team that captured bronze in Athens
fell to Italy 215-211 in misty conditions and placed ninth in the event.</P>
      <P>In other events Monday,  Hsieh Yu-hsing, competing in the badminton men's
singles, advanced to the round of 16 with a 21-16, 15-21, 21- 15 victory over
Nguyen Tien Minh of Vietnam and will next play Wong Choong Hann of Malaysia, who
upset Taufik Hidayat of Indonesia.</P>
      <P>But the women's doubles pairing of Cheng Wen-hsing and Chien Yu-chin was ousted
in the quarterfinals by third seeds Wei Yili and Zhang Yawen of China, 21-14,
21-18.</P>
      <P>Although swimming is one of Taiwan's weakest events,  Hsu Chih-chieh reached the
final 16 in the 200-meter butterfly, becoming the first male swimmer from Taiwan
to reach the final 16 in any Olympic swimming event.</P>
      <P>While the athletes were competing, local television stations were under fire for
Olympic coverage that often defied logic, cutting off events before their
conclusion and showing few events live.</P>
      <P>In fairness, the Taipei-Ukraine archery match was broadcast live, but Taiwan's
tennis fans were not able to see Lu's stunning victory.</P>
      <P>Two networks,  Taiwan's China Television  System and China Television Co.,
broadcast images from the last few games of the match on small screens that left
the players barely visible during their nightly newscast, but completely missed
Lu's match point while reporting other news stories.</P>
      <P>CTS showed a replay of the match later in the evening.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.N. initiative to be 'measured, not provocative': MOFA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  11  (CNA)
08/12/08  11:27:44

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government will adopt a gentle, flexible and pragmatic  approach toward the
country's bid for representation in the United Nations this year, a Ministry of
Foreign Affairs (MOFA) official said Monday.</P>
      <P>"The wording of our U.N. initiative will be measured and not provocative this
year, focusing on urging the world to heed the issue of Taiwan's lack of
representation in the world body, " said the official who preferred anonymity.</P>
      <P>Revealing that the MOFA is communicating with the United States and Taiwan's
diplomatic allies about technical details regarding the initiative, the official
said the MOFA is scheduled to brief the public on this year's U.N. proposal Aug.
15.</P>
      <P>Taiwan, as the Republic of China, lost its U.N. seat to the People's Republic of
China in 1971, and has made unsuccessful bids annually to rejoin the body since
1993.</P>
      <P>Under  the  previous  Democratic  Progressive  Party  (DPP) administration, the
country applied to join the United Nations in the name of Taiwan for the first
time last year, drawing criticism not only from China but also the United States
-- Taiwan's most important security partner -- as the move implied Taiwan was
seeking formal independence.</P>
      <P>With tentions  across the Taiwan Strait thawing since the inauguration of
President Ma Ying-jeou of the Kuomintang (KMT) in May, the MOFA official said
this year's proposal would not use the word "join" because it would imply that
Taiwan is seeking U.N. membership as a new nation, similar to the DPP
administration's bid last year.</P>
      <P>"Nor will we use the word 'rejoin' because it would imply that we would vie with
Beijing for the 'China' seat in the U.N., " the official explained.</P>
      <P>The avoidance of the words "join" and "rejoin" is also mandated by the fact that
neither of the DPP-initiated referendum on "joining" the U.N. as "Taiwan" and
the KMT-initiated referendum on "rejoining" the U.N. under any suitable name
garnered enough votes to make them valid in the votes held alongside the March
22 presidential poll, the official added.</P>
      <P>Although the current law stipulates that a failed referendum cannot be raised
again for three years, the official said the government will definitely ask
Taiwan's diplomatic allies to bring up the country's U.N. representation issue
at this year's General Assembly session scheduled to open in mid-September.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of the Interior (MOI) accepted Tuesday the registration of the
Taiwan Communist Party as the 141st political party in Taiwan, following the
revocation in June of a legal clause that banned civic organizations advocating
communism.</P>
      <P>"The reason based on which the party was denied registration no longer exists,"
the ministry said in a statement.</P>
      <P>The ministry had previously turned down requests by the group to register as a
political party on several occasions, in accordance with Article 2 of the Civic
Organizations Act stipulating that "the organization or activities of civic
groups cannot advocate communism or territorial separatism."</P>
      <P>On June 20, however, the Constitutional Court ruled that the article was in
violation of the people's freedom of assembly and freedom of speech enshrined in
the Constitution and should be revoked with immediate effect.</P>
      <P>On concerns that the Taiwan Communist Party might engage in activities
endangering  the Republic of China's existence  or disrupting the country's
democracy, the MOI said in the event of such a situation, the party can be
ordered to disband if it is determined by the Constitutional Court to have
violated the Constitution.</P>

      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan told a visiting delegation from the U.S. House of
Representatives Monday that cross-Taiwan Strait interactions have gradually
improved since the administration of President Ma Ying-jeou took office in May.</P>
      <P>The group of nine members, organized by the House Committee on Transportation
and Infrastructure, was the largest to visit Taiwan since 2003. It was led by
Jerry Costello (D-Ill.) , chairman of the Subcommittee on Aviation.</P>
      <P>Liu said the House representatives' visit demonstrates the United States'
affirmation of Taiwan's democracy and the development of cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>He added that the visit is deeply significant in terms of illustrating U.S.
Congress' strong support for and friendship with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Noting that this is the first visit to Taiwan by many members of the delegation,
Liu expressed the hope that the congressmen could learn more about Taiwan's
situation during the trip and that more members of the U.S. Congress will visit
the country in the future.</P>
      <P>During their meeting, Liu also briefed the congressmen on the government's new

      <P>Taiwan has successfully joined the world in developing a solid oxide fuel cell,
which generates more power but conserves more energy, a local researcher said
Monday.</P>
      <P>By 2010, local convenience stores and small supermarkets could be powered by the
fuel cell if the government subsidizes the program, said Lee Chien-hsiung, the
head of the Cabinet-level Atomic Energy Council (AEC) 's Institute of Nuclear
Energy Research (INER) fuel cell program.</P>
      <P>Lee said the power efficiency of solid oxide fuel cells could reach 40-60
percent, or over 90 percent if combined with heat. The power efficiency of
general fuel cells is 20-35 percent.</P>
      <P>The fuel cell could first produce electricity by reacting with fuels such as
natural gas, diesel fuel, coal and bio-ethanol, and then generate more power
through a connection with a heater, Lee explained.</P>
      <P>The institute is the only organization in Taiwan that conducts research on solid
oxide fuel cells, and the model developed is the culmination of five years of
research, he noted.</P>
      <P>The solid oxide fuel cell system developed by the institute is large in size,
Lee said, adding that the institute will display a 2,000-watt model measuring
155 centimeters high, 120 centimeters wide and 70 centimeters deep in 2009.</P>
      <P>A 5,000-watt  to 10,000-watt  model is enough to power a convenience store or a
small supermarket, Lee said, predicting that one system could cost as much as
NT$1.5 million (US$48,138).</P>
      <P>Taiwan has more than 9,000 convenience stores.</P>
      <P>To promote wide use of the system, Lee suggested the government follow the model
established in Japan, where the systems are bought with public funds and then
rented to private companies at a low price.</P>
      <P>This will create incentives for local manufacturers and further boost the market
for the systems, he noted.</P>
      <P>The United States, the European Union (EU) and Japan are actively promoting the
commercialization of solid oxide fuel cell products as part of their efforts to
save energy and reduce carbon dioxide emissions, he said.</P>
      <P>The U.S. is expected to see large numbers of such products available in the
market after 2016, Lee said.</P>
      <P>According to the the U.S. Department of Energy's forecast, the solid oxide fuel
cell products could generate a combined 72 billion watts by 2025 in the U.S. and
help save a combined energy cost of US$50 billion, Lee pointed out.</P>

64 schools, 43 public health clinics and hospitals and a health rehabilitation
center in remote areas of Sichuan.</P>
      <P>More than 1.5 million victims of the magnitude 8.0 earthquake that struck the
southwestern Chinese province in May 12 have benefited from this assistance,
Chen said.</P>
      <P>He added that much of the Taiwan Red Cross' quake relief assistance in Sichuan
over the past three months has focused on more remote areas that have been
neglected in reconstruction efforts.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's three women's archers crashed out of the individual competition at the
Olympic Games Tuesday, a fitting end for a group that fell far short of its
potential in Beijing.</P>
      <P>The women's softball team also suffered a deflating, though not lethal, blow,
falling to Canada 6-1 on the opening day of the Olympic softball tournament.</P>
      <P>Canada was seen as one of the teams Taiwan had to beat to have any chance of
finishing in the top four after the round robin phase of the eight-team
tournament and contend for a medal.</P>
      <P>Later Tuesday afternoon, men's singles player Lu Yen-hsun and the "golden"
women's doubles team of Chan Yung-jan and Chuang Chia-jung in tennis, and men's
singles star Hsieh Yu-hsing in badminton were hoping to lift Taiwan's morale.</P>
      <P>No athlete was more disappointed Tuesday that Yuan Shu-chi, who finished fourth
in the individual archery competition in Athens in 2004 but was knocked out in
the second round of the 64-women draw on Tuesday by China's Zhang Juanjuan
110-105.</P>
      <P>"I never could get the feel of my release point. I tried to do my best but
instead was consistently off, " said Yuan, who was unable to hold back the tears
after her defeat. "Even though I kept making adjustments, I still wasn't
accurate. I was even surprised (by how poorly I performed.)"</P>
      <P>Yuan, who finished sixth out of 64 archers in Saturday's qualification round,
struggled the entire morning, shooting only one 10 against Zhang and three in an
earlier first round 104-101 victory over Alexandra Feeney of Australia.</P>
      <P>She stayed even with Zhang after the first three arrows, but four 8's in the
next six arrows left her too far behind the consistent Zhang to mount a late
comeback.</P>
      <P>Yuan's teammate Wu Hui-ju, along with Yuan a member of Taiwan's silver-medal
winning team in Athens, collapsed in her first round match Tuesday afternoon,
losing 104-98 to Leidys Brito of Venezuela.</P>
      <P>The normally consistent Wu shot two 7's in her first six arrows and never
recovered.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's third women's archer,  Wei Pi-hsiu, concluded her nightmarish Olympics
with a 108-99 first round defeat to Athens bronze medalist Alison Williamson of
Great Britain.</P>
      <P>Wei, Taiwan's weak link in the team event, shot three 7's and four 8's to hand
Williamson an easy victory.</P>
      <P>The women archers were tipped to win a medal in the team competition and Yuan
and Wu were both expected to perform well in the individual competition.</P>
      <P>In softball, Canada's lineup had little trouble solving Taiwan's pitchers,
pounding out 11 hits in the seven-inning game. Taiwan's starter, Wu Chia-yen,
gave up four runs (three earned) on six hits in 2 2/3 innings to take the loss.</P>
      <P>Canada scored two runs in the second inning and two more in the third to put the
game out of reach. Taiwan's only offense was a home run by third baseman Li
Chiu-ching in the seventh.</P>
      <P>With the U.S.,  Japan, and Australia considered the medal favorities, China,
Canada and Taiwan were seen to be competing for the fourth and final spot in the
medal round.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Kyle MacDonald, the Canadian blogger who obtained a house through a series of
barters that began with a paperclip, will visit Taiwan later this month for a
workshop in which he will share his experience with participants, the organizer
said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Those who are interested in taking part are required to prepare a school bag
filled with stationery to trade during the one-hour session with MacDonald Aug.
27 at The Sherwood Taipei, according to Chiang Hsin-yi,  president of the
Taiwan-based free classified advertisement Website kijiji.com.tw.</P>
      <P>Kijiji aims to collect at least 100 new or used school bags, which will be
donated to disadvantaged school children in southern Taiwan, Chiang said.</P>
      <P>Potential participants are urged to sign up online by e-mailing their names and
telephone numbers to Kijiji at ppan@kijiji.com, she said.</P>
      <P>Inspired by a childhood game called "Bigger or Better, " MacDonald began his
legendary quest with a post on the U.S.-based free classified advertisement
Website Cragslist on July 12, 2005, in which he offered to trade one red
paperclip for "something bigger or better."</P>
      <P>The 14 trades that followed involved a fish-shaped pen, a hand-sculpted
doorknob, a Coleman camp stove, a Honda generator, an instant party, a Ski-doo
snowmobile, a trip for two, a cube van, a recording contract with Metal Works, a
year's rent in Phoenix, Arizona, one afternoon with Alice Cooper, a KISS
motorized snow globe, a role in the film Donna on Demand, and eventually a two-
story farmhouse in Kipling, Saskatchewan on July 5, 2006.</P>
      <P>Several of the trades were covered by news channels including CNN, ABC News, BBC
and CBC Newsworld. MacDonald published the book "One Red Paperclip" in 2007 and
now holds the Guinness World Record for the Most Successful Internet Trade.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, online bartering is also becoming increasingly popular as people are
seeking an economically viable way of life to cope with inflation, according to
kijiji's Chiang.</P>
      <P>During the first six months of this year, a total of 134,766 new items were
posted under kijiji's barter section, rising sharply by 72 percent compared with
the same period last year, Chiang said.</P>
      <P>Only around 50,000 items remain on Kijiji at present, which indicates quick
turnover, she said.</P>
      <P>The largest number of items put up for bartering are in the categories of
women's clothing, household products and gifts by credit card companies, with
housewives, female office workers and students being the largest groups engaging
in the trades, she said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government will release an assessment report by December on whether to
develop the gambling industry in Taiwan, and if it is assessed as feasible,
priority will most likely be given to the outlying islands to open this type of
business, the country's top economic planner said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chen Tain-jy, chairman of the Council for Economic Planning and Development
(CEPD) , said that the outlying island county of Penghu, with a view to boosting
its economy,  has long demanded the legalization of the gambling industry and
has been seeking permission to develop gambling as a business there.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the northern counties of Miaoli and Taipei are also actively seeking
permission to operate gambling establishments there, Chen added.</P>
      <P>The calls by local governments for the legalization of the gambling industry
have intensified since May 20 when President Ma Ying-jeou took office, as this
was one of his election promises.</P>
      <P>Chen said the report will include the possible impact of the gambling industry
on the society and whether it is good time to open casinos in Taiwan. It will
also cover regulations governing the gambling industry, such as licensing
issues,  casino operation management and methods of income allocation.</P>
      <P>He added that if the assessment concludes that the plan is viable, and after all
the relevant regulations have been formulated, all local governments would be
allowed to file applications to start such businesses.</P>
      <P>However, priority would be given to the country's offshore islands, given that a
recent CEPD survey showed that most respondents favored opening up the offshore
islands to the development of the gambling business, Chen said.</P>
      <P>The offshore islands include Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu, Chen specified, adding
however that the local governments would be required to show that they have the
approval of local residents, that they could obtain investments by appropriate
international investors and that the business would create economic benefits.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks after he concluded a fact-finding tour of casino
operations in Melbourne, Australia last week where he attended the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation (APEC) ministerial meeting.</P>
      <P>Chen said Australia's gambling business is not operated any differently from
other industries. But in fact, it is a very complicated and difficult business
to deal with and requires a comprehensive management system, he said.</P>
      <P>He further explained that the country has many rules governing the gambling
industry, such as those related to the management of products,  betting
calculators,  odds calculators  and gambling operators.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Presidential Office confirmed today that Taiwan's United Nations bid this
year will sidestep the thorny question of what name the country should use to
apply, and instead focus on securing Taiwan's "participation" in the
organization.</P>
      <P>Presidential Office Spokesman Wang Yu-chi told CNA that the approach of the
previous pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party government in the past
eight years had failed in part because it focused too much on the name issue.</P>
      <P>Wang said that under the government of Ma Ying-jeou, U.N. bids this September
and in future years would focus on participation, because "only participation is
meaningful."</P>
      <P>Wang's comments confirmed a report earlier today in the China Times, a local
daily newspaper, which cited unnamed National Security Council officials saying
this year's U.N. bid would sidestep the issue of whether to apply as "Taiwan" or
the "Republic of China."</P>
      <P>For the past 15 years, Taiwan has failed in its bid to become a U.N. member due
to opposition from China. Last year's failed bid was the first to use "Taiwan"
instead of the Republic of China, the island's formal name, in a move to
highlight the nation's de facto independence.</P>
      <P>China and the U.S. criticized last year's bid using "Taiwan" as an attempt to
alter the cross-Taiwan Strait status quo.</P>
      <P>The 63rd U.N. General Assembly will convene in mid-September this year, at which
time Taiwan is expected to make another bid for participation.</P>
      <P>Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Henry Chen emphasized today that the
government is still negotiating with the U.S. and Taiwan's diplomatic allies
over the details of this year's bid.</P>
      <P>Chen said that Deputy Foreign Minister Andrew Hsia will elaborate on the details
on Friday.</P>
      <P>Senior foreign ministry sources who did not want to be identified also confirmed
to CNA that this year's bid will avoid the name dispute. They said this year's
bid will follow the principles of "pragmatism and flexibility, " in line with Ma
Ying-jeou's call for a "diplomatic truce" with China.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the DPP's legislative caucus blasted Ma's plan in a press conference
today, arguing that the government should continue to bid for full U.N.
membership under the name "Taiwan."</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Wong Chin-chu criticized President Ma Ying-jeou for emphasizing
his Taiwanese identity on the campaign trail earlier this year, but then
downplaying it after winning the presidency in March.</P>
      <P>Also today,  DPP Chairwoman  Tsai Ing-wen  criticized  the government, urging it
to consider carefully what type of U.N. bid would best suit the nation's
interests and its people's common aspirations.</P>
      <P>Tsai said that the KMT's thinking does not meet the needs of a majority in
Taiwan. She urged the KMT to conduct a comprehensive review of its China policy,
its stance on Taiwan's sovereignty and its position  on the country's  drive  to
join  international organizations.</P>

      <P>One way to prevent high blood pressure, diabetes and abnormal blood lipid levels
is to reduce the waistline, according to a report released Tuesday by the Health
Foundation of Millenary Love.</P>
      <P>The report says that the foundation asked Shih Hsin University to conduct a
survey in late July by interviewing 517 patients aged 40 to 54.</P>
      <P>The survey found that 80 percent of the respondents knew that they were a high-
risk group that could be affected by various disorders,  including coronary
artery disease,  atherosclerosis, cerebral congestion, stroke, diabetes, kidney
disease, fatty liver and heart failure.</P>
      <P>However, the study found that 50 percent of them did not know what was meant by
metabolic syndrome -- a combination of medical disorders  that increase the risk
of developing  diabetes and cardiovascular disease.</P>
      <P>Symptoms of metabolic syndrome include a large waistline, high blood pressure,
high blood sugar levels, abnormal triglyceride levels, and abnormal high density
lipoprotein cholesterol levels. If someone has three or more such symptoms, they
have metabolic syndrome and a higher risk of suffering from life-threatening
illnesses.</P>
      <P>The results of the survey also showed that nearly 90 percent of the patients
were ignorant of the normal levels of blood pressure, blood sugar and blood fat,
and that nearly 70 percent did not know the normal healthy waistline
measurements, with 43 percent believing that waist measurements are not
important.</P>
      <P>Sun Lu-chien, a board director of the foundation, pointed out that according to
statistics released by the Cabinet-level Department of Health in 2007, people
under 70 who contracted cerebral vascular diabetes,  diabetes,  heart  disease
and  other  metabolic syndrome-related disorders lived 12.7 years shorter than
average.</P>
      <P>"Men should keep their waistlines at less than 90 cm, and for women, the waist
measurements should be less than 80 cm," she said, adding that it is important
to maintain a healthy diet and exercise regularly to keep the blood pressure,
blood sugar and blood fat at normal levels.</P>

      <P>The activity area for Chinese sailors at an Ilan port has been expanded, the
first step in a nationwide effort to improve facilities for such sailors, a
fishing official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Sha Chih-i, director-general of the Fisheries Agency under the Cabinet-level
Council of Agriculture, said that Nanfang-ao port had expanded its activity area
for Chinese sailors.</P>
      <P>He made the announcement after President Ma Ying-jeou said earlier today at a
national fisheries conference that the government has agreed to expand areas set
aside for Chinese sailors and fisherman at ports island-wide.</P>
      <P>The activity area expansion project at Nanfang-ao was completed Aug. 5, Sha
said.</P>
      <P>Nanfang-ao is the first port to complete its expansion. A similar expansion at
Wuci Port will be completed by the end of this year, while the reception center
at Badouzih fishing port in Keelung will expand next year, Sha said.</P>
      <P>Sha noted that Nanfang-ao's reception center for Chinese sailors was previously
located at the end of the port, next to a checkpoint. After complaints from the
fishermen and negotiations, fishing officials decided to expand the reception
area to 120 meters by 50 meters.</P>
      <P>The Fisheries Agency is also willing to provide sports equipment for the sailors
and fishermen, Sha said.</P>
      <P>According to Sha, the next stage of construction is to drape a canopy over the
activity area in order to keep out rain and wind.</P>

    <HEADLINE>New cervical cancer vaccine hits market</HEADLINE>

      <P>The country's second cervical cancer vaccine went on sale Tuesday, providing
local women with one more choice of protection against the disease.</P>
      <P>The new vaccine, called "Cervarix, " is recommended for females between the ages
of 10 and 25. It joins "Gardasil, " another vaccine that hit the market two
years ago and is for females aged 9 to 26, according to Chow Song-nan, an
obstetrics and gynecology doctor at National Taiwan University Hospital.</P>
      <P>The two vaccines spur development of antibodies against human papillomavirus
(HPV) types 16 and 18, which cause most cases of cervical cancer.</P>
      <P>The new vaccine also blocks infections resulting from HPV types 31, 45, and 52
-- also associated with cervical cancer -- and protects against HPV types 6 and
11, which cause genital warts, Chow said.</P>
      <P>As with Gardasil, Cervarix vaccination includes three doses within six months.
Complete vaccination costs NT$12,000 (US$385) . Recipients must pay the full
cost, as the vaccine is not covered by National Health Insurance.</P>
      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) estimated that free nationwide vaccination for 13
-year-old female teenagers would cost NT$1 billion. The Legislative Yuan has
rejected a much smaller NT$2.5 million program to provide subsidies for
vaccinations.</P>
      <P>Currently, women aged 30 or older can receive free, annual Pap smear tests for
cervical cancer under National Health Insurance. Chow said such tests are
critical for early discovery of the disease.</P>
      <P>However, only 30 percent of Taiwanese women have taken the examination in the
past 10 years, he said.</P>
      <P>According to DOH statistics, every year 5,700 women in Taiwan are diagnosed with
cervical cancer, and about 900 die from the disease.</P>
      <P>Chow urged females to get vaccinated and get routine cervical Pap smears.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of the Interior (MOI) might offer two-year interest-free mortgages
to eligible young couples in the hope of boosting the marriage rate, MOI
officials said at a Tuesday workshop.</P>
      <P>The new initiative originated with President Ma Ying-jeou during his
presidential election campaign earlier this year.</P>
      <P>"The plan has been mapped out in order to encourage young people to get married
and have babies, " Interior Minister Liao Liou-yi said at the workshop.</P>
      <P>According to the draft plan, newlyweds can file applications twice for loans to
a maximum of NT$2 million with zero-percent interest. Within two years of the
registration of their marriage, the couple can apply for their first interest-
free loan, and can apply again when they have children, or adult children who
are still in school.</P>
      <P>The eligible applicants will benefit from the interest-free mortgage for two
years, with the government providing an annual NT$68,500 subsidy per household,
said Huang Ching-mao,  acting director of the MOI's Construction and Planning
Agency.</P>
      <P>From the third year onward, applicants will have to pay low interest rates, with
a subsidy of NT$13,200 from the government.</P>
      <P>Those who prefer to rent a house or apartment can also benefit from the new
program with a maximum monthly subsidy of NT$3,600 per household for two years,
he added.</P>
      <P>To qualify for the interest-free financing, at least one member of the couple
should have a full-time job, and there are quota limitations -- 10,000 for home
buyers and 20,000 for rental subsidies in the initial stage.</P>
      <P>According to MOI statistics, a total of 131,851 marriages were registered last
year.</P>
      <P>In order to help people in real need, "rich people, " which the MOI defined as
those with annual incomes of more than NT$2.18 million in Taipei City, or
NT$1.57 million in Kaohsiung City, or NT$1.4 million in the rest of the country,
will be excluded from the program, Huang noted.</P>
      <P>In addition, the value of the property that newlyweds plan to buy should not
exceed 10 times the couple's annual income, Huang said.</P>
      <P>Liao said the draft of the plan will be sent to the Executive Yuan for review
and approval and is expected to be put into effect next January.</P>

      <P>Government agencies have made steady progress in waste recycling in recent
years, with the recycling rate climbing from 72.6 percent in 2002 to 76 percent
in 2007, the Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Under the resources-saving campaign, government agencies have also saved
considerable amounts of money, said Ho Soon-ching, director-general of the EPA's
Department of Waste Management.</P>
      <P>She added that from 2006 to 2007, with the assistance of the Ministry of
Economic Affairs (MOEA) , the industrial sector recycled and re-used industrial
waste to a total value of NT$80.5 billion, while the TEF-LCD and chip-
manufacturing industries saved NT$640 million in prime costs of TFT-LCDs under
the guidance of the National Science Council.</P>
      <P>Ho noted that recycled silicon was an particularly important item among the
various types of recycled industrial waste, as there is strong global demand due
to the development of the photonic and solar energy industries.</P>
      <P>In April, the MOEA designated waste silicon as industrial waste that should be
recycled.</P>
      <P>According to the EPA, the price of silicon on the international market has risen
from NT$2-3 million per metric ton in 2007 to NT$8-9 million at present.</P>

      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan expressed concern Tuesday  about Chinese people coming
to Taiwan illegally  and instructed the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) and the
Ministry of the Interior (MOI) to pay attention to the matter.</P>
      <P>"If there is a need to amend the law, government agencies should coordinate
their views and include them in discussions under a cross-Taiwan Strait dialogue
mechanism," the premier said.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks after presiding over the first meeting on law and order
since his Cabinet's May 20 inauguration during which he listened to a report
from Vice Interior Minister Chien Tai-lang on the management of Chinese people
visiting Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chien reported that since the opening of cross-strait exchanges in the late
1980s, Chinese people have had more channels to access Taiwan, although
violations are also frequent.</P>
      <P>The most common approaches for illegal entry are marriages of convenience,
visits to non-existent relatives, posing as fishermen, furnishing false papers,
bogus tourism and using legal professional exchanges.</P>
      <P>Chien  also said that since Taiwan's  opening  to Chinese professionals, 500,000
Chinese have obtained entry in the areas of trade, business, culture, education
and sports.</P>
      <P>However, some of them have withheld information about serving in the Communist
Party of China or the People's Liberation Army, he said.</P>
      <P>The ministry has found that some of the professionals were current or former
members of the National People's Congress or had served in the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference.</P>
      <P>Often, the individuals or institutions that invited them failed to verify or
disclose their positions, and the ministry will keep tabs on the issue, Chien
said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Researchers at Academia Sinica -- Taiwan's leading research organization -- have
discovered that the presence of hexasaccharide Globo H and its precursor, Gb5,
in cancer stem cells might help scientists develop a vaccine for breast cancer.</P>
      <P>According to a news release posted on the Academia Sinica Web site,  Globo H has
been used as a vehicle in developing an immunotherapeutic vaccine for breast
cancer and has successfully passed phase one clinical trials in the United
States.</P>
      <P>Led by Academia Sinica President Wong Chi-huey and Alice Yu, associate director
of the Genomics Research Center, a team of researchers conducted a series of
tests to see if the breast cancer vaccine can also target the cancer stem cells.</P>
      <P>Since 2003, researchers around the world have been looking for a cure for breast
cancer by targeting cancer stem cells, which possess the ability of stem cells
to multiply and differentiate into their progenitors,  display resistance to
chemotherapy  and radiation therapy, and could be the root cause for relapse and
metastasis of cancerous tumors.</P>
      <P>The team's innovative approach has proved quite successful. Using flow cytometry
to examine tumor tissue obtained from 53 breast cancer patients at the Tri-
Service  General Hospital in Taipei,  the researchers found that both Globo H
and Gb5 can be found in the breast cancer stem cells.</P>
      <P>The results of the study show that of all the tests done, Globo H is 61 percent
positive on regular breast cancer cells and 20 percent positive on breast cancer
stem cells, while Gb5 is 77.5 percent positive on regular breast cancer cells
and 62.5 percent on breast cancer stem cells.</P>
      <P>"The team is thrilled by the results, which suggest that the Globo H vaccine
will not only target the cancer cells, but also the cancer stem cells, in a one-
for-all raid," the news release said.</P>
      <P>"Researchers are particularly excited about the discovery of Gb5 in cancer
cells, since the results shows that Gb5 is even more easily spotted on both
regular  breast cancer cells and stem cells, indicating that Gb5 may be another
candidate for cancer therapeutics study," it added.</P>
      <P>In animal experiments, the researchers proved that the Globo H vaccine can
induce antibodies against both Globo H and Gb5.</P>
      <P>In the second stage of the research, the Globo H breast cancer vaccine will be
used in clinical trials on humans by a pharmaceutical company in Taiwan,
according to the researchers.</P>
      <P>The results of the study were published in the online Early Edition of
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.</P>

      <P>Lu, 23, lifted 104 kg in the snatch and 127 kg in the clean and jerk section of
the event.</P>
      <P>Pak Hyon Suk won North Korea's first weightlifting medal of the Olympics in the
event, lifting a total of 241 kg for the gold, while Irina Nekrassova of
Kazakhstan took the silver with a total lift of 240 kg.</P>
      <P>Lu attributed her victory to her coach Liao Chih-ing and visiting coach Zhang
Jiamin from China.</P>
      <P>She also said she was "caught by surprise" by the bronze, saying that her coach
had told her she would only get eighth place, so that she felt quite relaxed in

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou embarked Tuesday on his first state visit since he took
office three months ago, in a bid to strengthen relations with Taiwan's allies
in Latin America.</P>
      <P>Ma and an 80-member delegation, who left on a regular commercial flight, will
attend the inaugurations of the presidents of Paraguay and the Dominican
Republic, two of Taiwan's 23 diplomatic allies.</P>
      <P>Ma will hold talks with other leaders of Taiwan's diplomatic allies during the
eight-day state visit to the region, and is scheduled to return to Taiwan Aug.
19, with an overnight stopover in San Francisco.</P>
      <P>In a brief speech before his departure, Ma said his trip is different in several
ways from those made by former President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>First, he said, cross-Taiwan Strait relations, which were on the verge of
breaking down during Chen's tenure, have improved under his administration.</P>
      <P>Ma cited the visits to Taiwan since July 4 by hundreds of Chinese tourists
traveling on the first ever regular direct cross-strait charter flights after
decades'  tension as an example of the improvement in bilateral relations.</P>
      <P>Ma said the new government is adopting a concept of "workable diplomacy," to
cement ties with Taiwan's allies and to rebuild mutual trust with countries that
do not have formal relations with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Another difference is that his stopover in San Francisco will be "purely for
transit" purposes, he said.</P>
      <P>There is no need to take any actions incongruous with a transit stop, as Taiwan
has established good communications and mutual trust with Washington since he
took office, Ma said.</P>
      <P>He referred to former President Chen Shui-bian's high-profile transits in the
United States which caused tension among Taiwan, the U.S., and China.</P>
      <P>The president said he is pleased to see that Taiwan's relations with Washington
have improved alongside Taipei-Beijing relations, and he expressed the hope that
his trip will help to carve out more international space for Taiwan.</P>

      <P>"The team is thrilled by the results, which suggest that the Globo H vaccine
will not only target the cancer cells, but also the cancer stem cells, in a one-
for-all raid," the news release said.</P>
      <P>"Researchers are particularly excited about the discovery of Gb5 in cancer
cells, since the results shows that Gb5 is even more easily spotted on both
regular  breast cancer cells and stem cells, indicating that Gb5 may be another
candidate for cancer therapeutics study," it added.</P>
      <P>In animal experiments, the researchers proved that the Globo H vaccine can
induce antibodies against both Globo H and Gb5.</P>
      <P>In the second stage of the research, the Globo H breast cancer vaccine will be
used in clinical trials on humans by a pharmaceutical company in Taiwan,
according to the researchers.</P>
      <P>The results of the study were published in the online Early Edition of
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.</P>

      <P>Taiwan won its second medal Tuesday when weightlifter Lu Ying-chi took bronze in
the women's 63-kg category with a total lift of 231 kg on the fourth day of the
Beijing Olympics.</P>
      <P>Lu, 23, lifted 104 kg in the snatch and 127 kg in the clean and jerk section of
the event.</P>
      <P>Pak Hyon Suk won North Korea's first weightlifting medal of the Olympics in the
event, lifting a total of 241 kg for the gold, while Irina Nekrassova of
Kazakhstan took the silver with a total lift of 240 kg.</P>
      <P>Lu attributed her victory to her coach Liao Chih-ing and visiting coach Zhang
Jiamin from China.</P>
      <P>She also said she was "caught by surprise" by the bronze, saying that her coach
had told her she would only get eighth place, so that she felt quite relaxed in
the clean and jerk event.</P>
      <P>Lu said she had made a lot of improvement over the past year due to "continued
hard training" and great assistance from Zhang.</P>
      <P>Former Minister of Education Ovid Tseng was on hand to witness Lu's victory and
said he "almost wanted to cry" when Lu was awarded the bronze.</P>
      <P>Another Taiwanese weightlifter, Chen Wei-ling, won bronze in the women's 48-kg
category Saturday.</P>
      <P>Cheng Chih-lang, a weightlifting coach who first spotted Lu when he was scouting
for potential talent in Pingtung County in southern Taiwan, said that Lu is
quiet and lives a simple life that revolves around training.</P>
      <P>"She goes after her goals singlemindedly, " Cheng said.</P>
      <P>He also expressed hope that the government and private sectors will attach more
importance to weightlifting, noting that it is not a popular sport in Taiwan.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou embarked Tuesday on his first state visit since he took
office three months ago, in a bid to strengthen relations with Taiwan's allies
in Latin America.</P>
      <P>Ma and an 80-member delegation, who left on a regular commercial flight, will
attend the inaugurations of the presidents of Paraguay and the Dominican
Republic, two of Taiwan's 23 diplomatic allies.</P>
      <P>Ma will hold talks with other leaders of Taiwan's diplomatic allies during the
eight-day state visit to the region, and is scheduled to return to Taiwan Aug.
19, with an overnight stopover in San Francisco.</P>
      <P>In a brief speech before his departure, Ma said his trip is different in several
ways from those made by former President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>First, he said, cross-Taiwan Strait relations, which were on the verge of
breaking down during Chen's tenure, have improved under his administration.</P>
      <P>Ma cited the visits to Taiwan since July 4 by hundreds of Chinese tourists
traveling on the first ever regular direct cross-strait charter flights after
decades'  tension as an example of the improvement in bilateral relations.</P>
      <P>Ma said the new government is adopting a concept of "workable diplomacy," to
cement ties with Taiwan's allies and to rebuild mutual trust with countries that
do not have formal relations with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Another difference is that his stopover in San Francisco will be "purely for
transit" purposes, he said.</P>
      <P>There is no need to take any actions incongruous with a transit stop, as Taiwan
has established good communications and mutual trust with Washington since he
took office, Ma said.</P>
      <P>He referred to former President Chen Shui-bian's high-profile transits in the
United States which caused tension among Taiwan, the U.S., and China.</P>
      <P>The president said he is pleased to see that Taiwan's relations with Washington
have improved alongside Taipei-Beijing relations, and he expressed the hope that
his trip will help to carve out more international space for Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>President Ma arrives at Los Angeles in low profile transit stop</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Los Angeles,  Aug.  12 (CNA)
08/13/08  12:14:37
(By Rachel Chan)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou was extended diplomatic courtesies consistent with
visiting foreign dignitaries after arriving in Los Angeles for a low profile
transit stop ahead of a six-day trip through Latin America.</P>
      <P>After disembarking from his commercial China Airlines flight, Ma was greeted by
Taiwan's representative to the United States Jason Yuan, American Institute in
Taiwan Chairman Raymond Burghardt and Director-General of Taipei Economic and
Cultural Office (TECO) in Los Angeles Kung Chung-chen.</P>
      <P>He then proceeded through the "Pershing Gate, " a protocol gate on the edge of
the airport used by foreign dignitaries when visiting the U.S., and was then
whisked away in a limousine without passing through customs.</P>
      <P>In keeping with Ma's desire to keep the overnight transit stop low profile, no
Taiwanese expatriates were at the airport to welcome the president, but China
Airlines did set up a red carpet and red banner at the Pershing Gate to greet
the president.</P>
      <P>Burghardt seemed pleased at the understated arrangements, and was quoted by TECO
senior press officer Derek Hsu as saying that "I have nothing to complain
about."</P>
      <P>Hsu stressed, however, that despite Ma's decision to stay low profile, the
courtesies he received were no different than for other heads of state.</P>
      <P>Ma is stopping in Los Angeles en route to Paraguay and the Dominican Republic,
where he will attend the inaugurations of Paraguayan President-elect Fernando
Lugo on Aug. 15 and Dominican Republic President-elect Leonel Fernandez on Aug.
16.</P>
      <P>The president said many times prior to the trip that his stopovers in the U.S.
are simply for the purpose of transit and will not do anything that conflicts
with the goal -- part of his effort to rebuild  the mutual trust between
Washington  and Taipei that deteriorated  in the final years  of the previous
Democratic Progressive Party administration.</P>
      <P>Ma's predecessor Chen Shui-bian often made use of state visits, including
transits through the U.S., to shift Taiwan's political struggle over its
identity to a broader international stage.</P>
      <P>In keeping with Ma's desire to maintain a low profile, he flew a commercial
flight from Taipei to Los Angeles with a streamlined entourage of 44 people.</P>
      <P>At the same time, 200 Taiwanese expatriates gathered at the Westin Hotel Los
Angeles, where Ma is planned to stay, to welcome him, rather than waiting for
the president at the airport.</P>
      <P>The president waved to them as he entered the hotel, Hsu said.</P>
      <P>Hsu noted that around 100 DPP supporters were also at the hotel, and
disparigingly shouted "ma-tong" -- meaning toilet bowl in Chinese -- at Ma.</P>
      <P>Presidential Office spokesman Wang Yu-chi told reporters earlier that Ma will
remain in the hotel during his stopover in Los Angeles and will not make any
public appearances, a move that he said is aimed at "rebuilding a new image of
Taiwan in the international community, and prove that Taiwan is trustworthy and
would keep its promise not to be a troublemaker."</P>
      <P>Wang said the president will have dinner with several "friends" in the U.S. and
have telephone conversations with U.S. senators and congressmen.</P>
      <P>"The aim is to simplify the transit stop instead of manipulating it as transit
diplomacy," he said.</P>
      <P>Ma is scheduled to leave Los Angeles for Paraguay at 6 a.m. Wednesday U.S. West
Coast time. On the way, he will make a refueling stop in Panama where he will
meet with Panamanian President Martin Torrijos on the way.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou is keeping tabs on the fortunes of Taiwan's Olympic team
in Beijing during his overseas trip, and was informed during his flight to Los
Angeles that Taiwan had won a second bronze medal in weightlifting, a
Presidential Office spokesman said.</P>
      <P>"The president was notified of the good news via a telegram sent by the China
Airlines and was delighted to know Taiwan won another medal, " spokesman Wang
Yu-chi told reporters during a regularly scheduled China Airlines Boeing 747-400
flight from Taipei to Los Angeles.</P>
      <P>"He also sent a congratulatory telegram right away to express his regards to the
family of the winner," Wang said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan won its second medal at the Beijing Olympics Tuesday when weightlifter Lu
Ying-chi took bronze in the women's 63-kilogram category with a total lift of
231 kg.</P>
      <P>Ma was seated in the first class section of the China Airlines commercial
flight, accompanied by other high-ranking government officials such as Foreign
Minister Francisco H.L. Ou, National Security Council Secretary-General Su Chi
and Chen Tain-jy, minister of the Council for Economic Planning and Development.</P>
      <P>There was a female passenger traveling along with the president and his
entourage in the first class section.</P>
      <P>Another 84-year-old lady surnamed Wang sitting in economy class told reporters
that she specifically changed her flight to this one after knowing that the
president would take the flight for his first state visit.</P>
      <P>On his first state visit since taking office May 20, Ma will attend the
inauguration ceremonies of Paraguayan President-elect Fernando Lugo on Aug. 15
and Dominican Republic President-elect Leonel Fernandez on Aug. 16.</P>
      <P>Given that Lugo has said many times he wants to switch diplomatic recognition to
China, Ma's eight-day visit is seen as a bid to cement ties with Paraguay and
the Caribbean country and a test of whether Taiwan  and China  will set aside
their  competition  in the international arena.</P>
      <P>After taking office, Ma said he would seek a "diplomatic truce" with China in an
attempt to end the so-called "checkbook diplomacy" conducted by both sides of
the Taiwan Strait, in which Taiwan and China solicit recognition by offering
large sums of money to poor countries.</P>
      <P>Apart from 44 government officials and staff, May was also accompanied by 36
journalists.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) on Wednesday  advised travelers to
Southeast Asia to take proper precautionary measures against mosquito bites as
an especially high number of imported dengue fever cases has been recorded so
far this year.</P>
      <P>According to CDC statistics, 107 Taiwanese residents have been infected by the
mosquito-borne disease overseas this year, including 59 cases recorded since the
beginning of summer.</P>
      <P>The number exceeded the 104 cases recorded during the first eight months of
2007, when a total of 179 cases were recorded for the whole year. It was also
higher than the 91 cases recorded in 2004 and the 104 cases in 2005 and was
comparable to the 109 cases in 2006.</P>
      <P>The situation makes it likely that the number of imported dengue fever cases
will hit a new high for this year, said CDC Deputy Director-General Shih Wen-yi.</P>
      <P>Shih warned that patients infected with dengue fever overseas can cause an
outbreak in Taiwan if they are not detected at airport quarantine checkpoints
upon their return, if they return to Taiwan during the highly contagious period
running from the day before onset of symptoms to five days after the onset, and
if there are Aedes aegypti mosquitos -- the primary vector of the dengue virus
-- in their neighborhood.</P>
      <P>In July, 10 members of a local religious group were infected with dengue fever
while taking part in volunteer relief efforts in Myanmar in the aftermath of
Cyclone Nargis, marking the first case of mass overseas dengue fever infections
to be recorded in Taiwan in recent years.</P>
      <P>The cases were only discovered after one of the patients sought treatment at a
local hospital after returning home.</P>
      <P>According to Shih, the dengue virus was later transmitted by mosquitos from one
of the patients to a woman and her daughter living in the neighborhood.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) Chairman Raymond Burghardt strongly hinted at
a dinner for President Ma Ying-jeou in Los Angeles Tuesday that bilateral
relations between Taiwan and the United States have warmed up considerably in
the past eight months.</P>
      <P>The last time I welcomed Taiwan's president was on the (freezing) tarmac in
Alaska in January and I'm happy that today it is in Los Angeles where the
temperature is 82 degrees Fahrenheit, Burghardt was quoted as saying at the
dinner by a government official, who refused to be named.</P>
      <P>The official declined to elaborate on Burghardt's statement, asking instead the
media to draw its own conclusions.</P>
      <P>Burghardt, the top U.S. liaison officer with Taiwan in the absence of official
ties, was referring to the stopover made by Ma's predecessor, Chen Shui-bian, in
Anchorage Jan. 13 on his way to Guatemala  to  attend  the  inauguration  of
then  Guatemalan President-elect Alvaro Colom.</P>
      <P>Washington forced Chen to transit in Alaska rather than on the U.S. continent
because of its displeasure with Chen's push for a referendum on joining the
United Nations under the name "Taiwan, " which the U.S. called provocative and
unnecessary.</P>
      <P>At the dinner, at which Ma was joined by 50 overseas Taiwanese leaders,
congressmen, and Ma's American friends, Burghardt said interactions between
Taiwan and the U.S. were good.</P>
      <P>Ma arrived at Los Angeles on Tuesday at 2 p.m. U.S. West Coast time  en  route
to attend  the  inaugurations  of Paraguayan President-elect Fernando Lugo on
Aug. 15 and Dominican Republic President-elect Leonel Fernandez on Aug. 16.</P>
      <P>Due to an agreement between the the U.S. and Taiwan, Ma is making no public
appearances during his overnight stopover in Los Angeles, and reporters were
denied access to any of his activities.</P>
      <P>Prior to the dinner, Ma met with four congressmen and had telephone
conversations with four senators and six congressmen, with whom he discussed his
"modus vivendi " approach.</P>
      <P>Ma has proposed adiplomatic trucewith China, which he said means Taiwan and
China should stop their longstanding diplomatic tug-of-war in which both sides
of the Taiwan Strait tried to lure each other's allies by offering large sums of
foreign aid.</P>
      <P>He also floated the notion ofworkable diplomacyormodus vivendiunder which Taiwan
would engage China in discussing the country's international space as the island
cements diplomatic relations with its remaining 23 allies.</P>
      <P>"Cross-strait relations are developing in a good direction. Taiwan will develop
its relations with the U.S. while it continues to improve its ties with China,Ma
was quoted as saying in the meetings and conversations with the U.S. politicians
by the official.</P>
      <P>Ma also reiterated that Taiwan is committed to purchasing defensive weapons from
the U.S. and said that if possible, the country hopes to sign a free trade
agreement with the U.S. in the future, according to the official.</P>
      <P>In keeping with Mas desire to keep the overnight transit stop low profile, the
official refused to confirm the identity of the congressmen who spoke with the
president.</P>
      <P>He would only say that Ma did not leave the hotel in which he stayed and would
meet with several Taiwanese international students in L.A. later Tuesday evening
local time.</P>
      <P>Although the president feels that both Taiwan and China as well as Taiwan and
the U.S. have established mutual trust, he decided to stay low key, as it is his
first state visit,the official said.</P>
      <P>Ma is scheduled to leave Los Angeles for Paraguay at 6 a.m. Wednesday U.S. West
Coast time. On the way, he will make a refueling stop in Panama where he will
meet Panamanian President Martin Torrijos.</P>

Party Legislator Gao Jyh-peng and his lawyer Lee Sheng-chen, Chen said the
article was a conspiracy engineered by prosecutors to try to sway public opinion
over a "state affairs fund" embezzlement case they are currently investigating.</P>
      <P>In a report published in its latest issue, Next weekly magazine said former
first lady Wu Shu-jen closed bank accounts belonging to herself and her husband
as well as several others created under the names of her son Chen Chih-chung and
her daughter Chen Hsing-yu that were used for stock trading, soon after the
exposure of the "state affairs fund" case in 2006.</P>
      <P>Wu then remitted an amount totaling NT$300 million overseas through various bank
accounts belonging to her daughter-in-law Huang Jui-ching and her family,
according to the magazine.</P>
      <P>It said the situation was discovered when prosecutors were scrutinizing the bank
accounts of the former first family as part of their probe into the high-profile
case.</P>
      <P>Wu was charged with corruption and forgery in November 2006 for using receipts
provided by others to claim reimbursements totaling NT$14.8 million from the
president's "state affairs fund" between July 2002 and March 2006.</P>
      <P>Gao, however, said the report obviously "goes against common sense" because the
assets of the former first family were under a trust during Chen's presidency,
which prevented them from managing the assets on their own.</P>
      <P>"Had the trust been canceled (before Chen's term ended in May 2008), everybody
would have known about it long ago," Gao said.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Gao said, stocks registered under the names of Chen Chih-chung and
Chen Hsing-yu have lost value for a long period of time and therefore have not
been sold.</P>
      <P>Unconvinced by Gao's explanation, ruling Kuomintang Legislator Wu Yu-sheng urged
Chen to make public the deposits and withdrawals of bank accounts belonging to
members of the former first family for public scrutiny.</P>
      <P>Chen, who had immunity from prosecution while in office, was named as a co-
defendant in the "state affairs fund" case as soon as he stepped down from the
presidency May 20.</P>
      <P>On Tuesday, he was questioned by prosecutors for the second time since July.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's Olympic baseball team has decided to appeal the positive doping test
result of Chang Tai-shan, one of the country's best hitters, Taiwan's Olympic
delegation leader Tsai Szu-chueh said Wednesday in Beijing.</P>
      <P>The test result of Chang's urine tube A, collected July 27, was confirmed
positive Tuesday, one day before Taiwan opened the Olympic baseball tournament
against the Netherlands.</P>
      <P>Chang, who was dismayed over the test result, denied taking any banned
substances, Tsai said, adding that Chang followed his doctor's instructions on
taking his medicine.</P>
      <P>Chang had been previously taking male fertility pills, but stopped using the
medication before attending the Games, Tsai explained.</P>
      <P>Tsai, nevertheless, questioned why Chang was able to pass a doping test at home
during the Asian Baseball Championship and the Baseball World Cup in late 2007,
but failed to pass the Olympic test.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan team will soon file an appeal with the World Anti-Doping Agency --
commissioned by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to conduct a urine
test on Taiwanese baseball players on July 27, Tsai said.</P>
      <P>If Chang's B sample fails to pass another test to be conducted in Japan on
Friday, Chang will be banned from international competition for the next two
years, Tsai noted.</P>
      <P>Chang is the only member of the baseball team whose urine test result was
positive.</P>
      <P>Taiwan did not have any substitutes available to take Chang's place, leaving
with a 23-man roster to face the Netherlands.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Gene experts at Academia Sinica have spotted a new referential indicator of
liver cancers related to the hepatitis B virus, and the findings may prove
helpful to the invention of new diagnostic procedures, sources at the renowned
institution said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The indicator,  discovered by members of Academia Sinica's Genomics Research
Center, involves a DNA examination of the genotype of hepatitis B virus. For
example, if a patient is found to carry genotype C, the risks of cancer
development will be as high as double that for those with genotype B.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, if mutations are found in the hepatitis B virus, the risks can
increase or decrease, depending on which region develops mutations.</P>
      <P>The risks are doubled if the mutation occurs in the basal core promoter; the
risks will be reduced to the one-third of general standards if the mutated area
is the precore region.</P>
      <P>The scientific paper, written by the center's Yang Hwai-I, Chen Pei-Jer, Chen
Ding-Shinn, Liaw Yun-Fan, and Chen Chien-Jen, will be published by Journal of
the National Cancer Institute in its August 20 issue.</P>
      <P>Chen Chien-Jen, a distinguished research fellow at the center and the former
chief of the National Science Council, explained that the team had spotted an
indicator in a previous study published in 2002, but it failed to provide a
comprehensive explanation of liver cancer development.</P>
      <P>The indicator found at that time was the E surface antigen of hepatitis B virus;
if a blood test for the antigen was positive, the risk of cancer was six times
higher than for patients who tested negative for the antigen.</P>
      <P>"However, compared to normal people, those patients who are negative for E
surface antigen still have relatively higher risks of liver cancers, which
indicates that there should another more effective, accurate index for liver
cancer diagnosis," said Chen Chien-Jen.</P>
      <P>According to Academia Sinica, the team's study followed 4,155 participants from
seven towns in Taiwan beginning in 1991.</P>
      <P>After the study concluded in 2004, the researchers compared those who carried
the DNA segments of hepatitis B virus in their blood and eventually developed
liver cancer to the virus DNA carriers that did not develop cancer.</P>
      <P>In the process, they found different genotypes of the hepatitis B virus that may
be correlated to liver cancer development among patients infected with hepatitis
B virus.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's Olympic baseball team rewarded the passion of its local fans Wednesday
when it opened its Beijing Games campaign with a 5-0 victory over the
Netherlands.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's starter, Chen Wei-yin,  pitched a brilliant seven innings, striking out
seven and walking none while yielding only three hits, to key the victory.</P>
      <P>The 23-year-old Chen, who pitches for the Chunichi Dragons in Japan's
professional baseball league, allowed only two Dutch hitters to reach second
base, in a performance that had even Netherlands manager Robert Eenhoorn
gushing.</P>
      <P>"Because of Chen, we had almost no scoring opportunities. The difference between
the two teams was the pitching, and Taiwan constantly kept us under pressure,"
said Eenhoorn, who played for the New York Yankees and California/Anaheim Angels
in the 1990s.</P>
      <P>Chen, who overpowered the Dutch batters with consistent fastballs in the low 90
mile-per-hour range, said the experience he had gained in the past four years
since playing in Athens in 2004 paid off Wednesday.</P>
      <P>"I throw harder and have a wider variety of pitches. Today I was really
satisfied with my velocity and control," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Reliever Cheng Kai-wen,  a 20-year-old who pitches at the university level in
Taiwan, pitched a scoreless two innings to complete the shutout.</P>
      <P>While Chen and Cheng shut the Dutch down, Taiwan jumped on Netherlands starter
David Bergman for a run in the second and three in the fourth to cruise to
victory.</P>
      <P>Shortstop Lin Chih-sheng opened the scoring when he walked, advanced  to third
on a Chiang Chih-hsien's  double down the right-field line, and came home on a
sacrifice fly by left fielder Lo Kuo-hui.</P>
      <P>Taiwan added three more in the fourth, paced by big hits from catcher Yeh Chun-
chang and center-fielder Lin Che-hsuan.</P>
      <P>"The pitching performance gave the hitters a lot of confidence, and they did a
pretty good job, and the fielding was also above average," said Taiwan's manager
Hung Yi-chung.</P>
      <P>The Netherlands was one of only two teams, along with China, in the eight-team
tournament that Taiwan was favored to beat.</P>
      <P>But such is the passion for the sport here that fans weren't taking any chances,
superstitiously  eating poached eggs,  or "hebaodan, " which sounds like
"Holland posting a zero" before the game.</P>
      <P>Next up for Taiwan, however, is Japan, one of the tournament's favorites and a
perennial thorn in the side of Taiwan baseball teams, and local fans will need
to conjure up more than high cholesterol superstitions to pick up a win.</P>
      <P>Japan opened the tournament later Tuesday against another gold medal hopeful,
Cuba.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's archers, considered as legitimate medal contenders entering the 2008

      <P>With the men's and women's teams finishing seventh and ninth respectively, and
none of the three women able to reach the round of 16 in the individual event
Tuesday, it was left up to the men to save the day.</P>

Korea's Park Kyung-Mo 111-110 and Wang losing to Japan's Moriya Ryuichi 114-109.</P>
      <P>Scores of 110 or above are considered excellent.</P>
      <P>"When the opponent is shooting that well, what else can you do, " said Wang.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's third archer, Chen Szu-yuan never lived up to the consistency he showed
four years ago in Athens, barely squeaking by Malaysian Muhammad Marbawi 107-106
with three 10s in his final three arrows.</P>
      <P>But he was then trounced by Russia's Tsyrempilov Baljinima of Russia 109-101 in
the second round, in match that included a rare 6, a complete misfire at this
level. Chen said he had been consistently hitting 9s or better in practice.</P>
      <P>The top score for hitting the bull's eye is 10.</P>
      <P>Lin Chen-hsian, coach of Taiwan's Olympic team, said the team had never gained
momentum at the Games.</P>
      <P>"There were high expectations for the team ahead of the games. Sometimes if you
don't receive so much attention, it can be easier (for the athletes) to put on a
normal performance," he added.</P>

      <P>Environmentalists demanded Wednesday that the government take immediate and
concrete actions to save a rare species of white dolphin in Taiwan, which was
recently classified as "critically endangered" by the International Union for
Conservation of Nature (IUCN).</P>
      <P>Although the Sousa chinensis species was accorded the highest level of
protection under Taiwan's Wildlife Conservation Act, the government has failed
to take the necessary steps to protect the dolphins from extinction,
environmentalist said at a workshop.</P>
      <P>In response, Lee Tao-sheng, deputy director general of the Forestry Bureau under
the Council of Agriculture, promised that representatives of Environmental
Protection Administration,  the Ministry of the Economic Affairs, the Fisheries
Agency and the Water Resources Agency will meet within one month to work out
solutions to the problem.</P>
      <P>"Some people may doubt whether it is worth the effort to try to protect these
dolphins, but when a species becomes extinct, it takes human beings one step
further to the end of existence, " warned Tien Chiu-chin, a legislator of the
main opposition Democratic Progressive Party, urging the government to attach
greater importance to the issue.</P>
      <P>Allen Chen, an associate research fellow at the Biodiversity Research Center of
Academia Sinica, indicated that the white dolphin issue is often ignored because
Taiwan puts more emphasis on studies and research into biodiversity on the east
coast.</P>
      <P>The Wild at Heart Legal Defence Association noted that the rare dolphin
population, currently around 100, is also threatened by industrial development
along the coastline, excessive fishing, and pollution of the water.</P>
      <P>The noises from construction close by may be fatal to the dolphins as it can
damage their sonar systems, the association warned.</P>
      <P>Urging the government to take action to protect the rare species, the
environmentalists asked that the dolphins' habitat be designated as a restricted
area to prevent overfishing.</P>
      <P>Some fishing gear, such as trawl nets, destroy the eco system indiscriminately,
they said, adding that researchers have found that one-third of the white
dolphin population has been injured.</P>
      <P>The activists further demanded that major construction plans be suspended until
it can be ascertained that the dolphins will not be affected.</P>
      <P>Although the white dolphins were classified as an endangered species by the
Council of Agriculture, the Environmental Protection Administration in early
June approved a plan by the Dragon Steel Corp. to expand its operations in an
area near the dolphins' habitat, raising  doubts  among  environmentalists  of
the  government's willingness and determination to protect the marine animals.</P>
      <P>The Sousa chinensis, also known as the Indo-Pacific Humpback Dolphin, is endemic
to waters off Taiwan's western coast, between Miaoli County in northern Taiwan
and Yunlin County in central Taiwan. The species is isolated from other
populations of dolphins along the coast of China, according to the Eastern
Taiwan Strait Sousa Technical Advisory Working Group.</P>
      <P>The dolphins usually change color, turning from grey to pinkish white, when they
reach maturity. They remain in shallow waters within five kilometers  from shore
and are very sensitive  to human activities, the environmentalists said.</P>
      <P>The population of the white dolphins was discovered in 2002, though their
earliest recorded appearance by fishermen dated back to 40 years ago, the
activists said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Teacher's association demands complementary measures for income tax</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug 13 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The National Teacher's Association (NTA) said Wednesday that the body is not
opposed to income tax being levied on primary and secondary school teachers if
such a move is inevitable, but added that the government should offer
compensation to relieve teachers of the new financial burden.</P>
      <P>The issue of reinstating income tax on teachers, along with military personnel,
was included as one of the major agenda items in a Wednesday meeting of Taiwan's
tax reform committee.</P>
      <P>The committee's financial officials and experts, who are said to have reached
consensus in bringing such taxation back, is to discuss the timetable for
implementing the tax, as well as complementary measures to alleviate the
situation for the estimated 300,000 teachers and servicemen who will be
affected.</P>
      <P>Before the meeting began, Yeh Ching-rong, an NTA convener who specializes in tax
issues, said that the return of taxes for teachers and military personnel would
intensify their already heavy financial burden due to inflation, and that the
committee should consider whether imposing income tax on teachers and military
personnel is appropriate at present.</P>
      <P>He said tax-exempt status for primary and secondary school teachers is an
important incentive for attracting people to the teaching profession and should
not be seen as a wrong measure.</P>
      <P>"We demand a series of reasonable complementary measures if the return of income
tax is inevitable," Yeh stressed.</P>
      <P>In 2002, the NTA successfully boycotted a government plan to recoup  income  tax
from teachers,  urging the then-Democratic Progressive Party government to carry
out complementary measures before levying the taxes.</P>
      <P>Income tax for primary school teachers has been suspended since 1955, while
secondary school teachers have been tax-exempt since 1979.</P>
      <P>Unlike the U.S., where secondary school encompasses junior high and high
schools, the three-year junior high school in Taiwan is classified as secondary
education, which is the final stage of compulsory education. Primary education
in Taiwan includes both kindergarten and elementary school.</P>
      <P>To ease the financial losses for teachers affected by the imposition of income
tax, Yeh suggested a reduction of their work hours by reducing the number of
classes they have to teach by two per week. "In addition, the monthly subsidies
for homeroom teaching should be increased by NT$2,000," he said.</P>
      <P>Apart from monetary support, Yeh said teachers will also need more assistance to
help them with administrative matters.</P>
      <P>Before the meeting, Finance Minister Li Sush-der told the press that the meeting
will work out complementary plans to help improve the work environment of
teachers and military officers.</P>
      <P>According to the ministry's calculations, should the taxation under discussion
be implemented, the government's tax revenues would be boosted by NT$15.5
billion (US$500 million) per year, including NT$9.8 billion from the country's
200,000 teachers.</P>
      <P>The meeting was also expected to discuss other issues such as the simplification
of business income tax, and the conclusions were to be disclosed later in the
day after the end of the meeting.</P>
      <P>The conclusions of the meeting will be submitted the Cabinet, which will hand
over the decisions to the Legislative Yuan to amend the relevant articles in the
income tax law.</P>

      <P>An annual music festival in the eastern county of Taitung will begin Saturday
with aboriginal music -- a feature of the county -- and pan-Asian reggae as the
two genres most strongly represented, a local official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>There will be a series of performances by local and foreign individuals and
independent groups, including many of Taiwan's aboriginal musicians, as well as
more than 10 top reggae bands from Japan and the Philippines, such as Machaco,
Papa-Ugee and Tropical Depression, the official said.</P>
      <P>The two-week festival, with major music performances being staged on two
weekends, will also feature various music workshops to be hosted by both local
and foreign musicians, along with several handicraft fairs showcasing local
artists' creations.</P>
      <P>The county has diverse musical resources thanks to its abundant aboriginal
cultures. About 30 percent of the county's population are aboriginal people,
representing six different tribes.</P>
      <P>The county's aboriginal music stunned the world music scene with the theme song
for the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, which was titled "Jubilant Drinking Song" and was
sung by Amis musician Difang Duana.</P>
      <P>Many stars of Taiwan's music industry come from the county, such as composers
Lee Tai-hsiang and Kimbo and singers/songwriters such as A-Mei, Purdur, Samingad
and Biung, the official said.</P>
      <P>The festival originated from a small art event in 2002 and has gradually become
a great chance for the county to promote its music resources and beautiful
landscape, the official said.</P>

      <P>According to the statement, a four-point consensus was reached at the

      <P>First, the private sector and enterprises in general must cooperate to create a
corruption-free environment. Second, national leaders and heads of government

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Kaohsiung city government is seeking to transform its Cijin Island into a
special tourism zone with an NT$40 billion (US$1.28 billion) development plan
for a 100-hectare plot of land, a city official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Hung Shu-hui, deputy director of the city's Urban Development Planning Bureau,
said the Sentosa-style resort plan received a good initial response from the
Tourism Bureau under the Ministry of Transportation and Communications after it
was submitted to the central Tourism Bureau in early July for reference.</P>
      <P>Hung said he hoped the central government will approve the project by early next
year so that the Kaohsiung city government can begin public bidding for
construction and development.</P>
      <P>The Cijin tourism development plan corresponds  to one of President Ma Ying-
jeou's "12 mega development projects, " Hung said, which is to transform
Kaohsiung City into a vibrant, diverse metropolis.</P>
      <P>Hung dismissed rumors that the 100-hectare zone would feature casinos.</P>
      <P>"The NT$40 billion tourism development plan is aimed at creating a sound
investment climate" for Cijin Island to make it "both an energy-effective and
tourism-centered area."</P>
      <P>Hung said the development plans will include hotels, restaurants, beach
facilities, recreational areas and historical sites. He said the city will also
promote the solar power industry in Cijin, taking advantage of the island's
sunny weather.</P>
      <P>In the first phase of developing the island, the government plans to upgrade
transportation to Cijin with an electric cable car, second underwater car tunnel
and a subway link, Hung said.</P>
      <P>According to Huang, the government sector already owns about 98 percent of the
100-hectare plot on Cijin, making it much easier for the city government to move
forward with the plan.</P>
      <P>Hung said he is optimistic that the tourism development project will draw a
large number of potential investors.</P>
      <P>A city government "Cijin Panel" has been working on the details of the tourism
development plan for three years, he said, meeting every one or two months.</P>

      <P>Public prosecutors detained the top water resources official of Chiayi County
early Wednesday after questioning him for the second time as the chief suspect
in a corruption case.</P>
      <P>According to the Chiayi District Prosecutors Office,  Chen Dian-bao, director of
the Chiayi county government's Water Resources Department, accepted NT$5 million
(US$160,610) in bribes between October 2006 and May 2007 to help four
construction companies obtain contracts awarded by his department for improving
or building drainage systems in Chiayi County.</P>
      <P>Also detained for their alleged involvement in the case were Tseng Yung-chih, a
technician in Chen's department, and a middleman, Wang Chao-shun.</P>
      <P>One of the owners of the construction companies, identified by the surname Chen,
and his wife were released after they confessed to bribing Chen and agreed to
become witnesses for the prosecution in return for commuted sentences.</P>
      <P>Two other businessmen -- Kuo Chao-liang and Lin Chao-sheng -- were released on
bail of NT$300,000 each, while a third businessman, Chuang Yu-chin, was released
on bail of NT$200,000, as prosecutors found that they had only violated the
Government Procurement Law.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors said they received tip-offs a year ago that Chen Dian-bao was
working in collusion with the construction companies to help them obtain
contracts for some of the county government's construction projects through
restricted bidding, in return for a kickback of 15 percent of the contract
value.</P>

      <P>Primary and secondary school teachers and military personnel will no longer be
exempt from income tax, beginning 2010 at the earliest, but the education and
defense ministries will compensate the estimated 300,000 be to affected,
Minister of Finance Li Sush-der announced Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Finance (MOF) will reimpose income tax on teachers and military
personnel when the legislature amends the income tax law," Li said at the press
conference after the Tax Reform Committee reached its final decision on the
issue.</P>
      <P>He said the plan to reinstate income tax for teachers and servicemen will be
completed before October, and a draft bill is expected to be sent to the
Legislative Yuan, which will amend the relevant article in the income tax law in
the first half of next year.</P>
      <P>"At that rate, the ministry could reintroduce the taxation in 2010 on annual
income earned in 2009," the minister estimated, adding that the additional tax
revenues could surpass NT$15 billion (US$484 million) a year.</P>
      <P>Local primary school teachers and military personnel have been exempt from
paying taxes since 1955, and secondary school teachers since 1979.</P>
      <P>Over the last 20 years many financial ministers have called for the exemption to
be lifted, arguing that teachers and military officers could no longer be
regarded as earning sub-standard pay.</P>
      <P>The decision Wednesday will restore social equity in the tax statues, said Li,
adding that the central government will allocate the additional tax revenues to
the Ministry of Education (MOE) and Ministry of National Defense to fund
compensatory measures.</P>
      <P>The additional revenue received from the tax payers in the military, estimated
to amount to NT$5.73 billion a year, will be included in the military budget to
increase the salaries of military personnel, according to the MOF.</P>
      <P>"The real income of military personnel will not be reduced, " Li stressed.</P>
      <P>Also the revenue obtained from income tax payments by an estimated 200,000
teachers will total around NT$10 billion, and will be allocated to the MOE to
improve the education system, he added.</P>
      <P>Li said the representatives of the National Teachers' Association (NTA) who were
at the committee meeting endorsed the taxation plan, on condition that the
additional tax revenues be used as part of the country's educational resources.</P>
      <P>To offset the loss of income by teachers under the proposed income tax revision,
the NTA suggested a reduction in the number of work hours and an increase of
NT$2,000 in the monthly subsidy for homeroom teaching.</P>
      <P>However, Li said that the committee did not lay out a specific compensation plan
for teachers because the MOE needs to further evaluate and finalize the details.</P>
      <P>The standard income tax rates -- 6 percent, 13 percent, 21 percent, 30 percent
and 40 percent depending on the salary level -- will be applied to the income of
the teachers and servicemen when the law takes effect, said Li.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>In two whirlwind days at the Beijing Olympics, Lu Yen-hsun went from being an
"unknown Taiwanese" to a "Taiwanese giant killer", becoming one of the country's
most celebrated athletes at the 2008 Games.</P>
      <P>But the momentum that carried him past world No. 6 Andy Murray of Scotland and
world No. 52 Agustin Calleri of Argentina petered out Wednesday when he ran into
Austrian buzz saw Jurgen Melzer.</P>
      <P>Holding his serve throughout the match without yielding even one break point,
Melzer established his superiority by breaking Lu in the opening game of the
match on his way to a 6-2, 6-4 victory.</P>
      <P>"My opponent just played too fast, and I couldn't find a way to counter it at
the beginning of the match," Lu said. "In the second set, I began to find a
rhythm and avoided playing at his pace. The score was closer and I really didn't
play that badly, but (Melzer) played better."</P>
      <P>Lu, who turns 25 Thursday, would have faced soon to be world No. 1 Spain's
Rafael Nadal in the quarterfinals had he beaten the Austrian, but he took
comfort in reaching the third round of the Olympics, something he has failed to
do any grand slam tournament.</P>
      <P>"After playing in this Olympics, I believe even more that I have the ability to
beat top-ranked players. In the U.S. Open (beginning August 25), I hope I can
get past the second round," Lu said.</P>
      <P>Melzer, ranked 51st in the world but generally a top 30 player until late last
year, never let Lu into the match, putting 79 percent of his first serves in
play in the first set.</P>
      <P>The Austrian broke Lu in the first and seventh games of the first set and again
in the first game of the second set, keeping the pressure on Lu throughout.</P>
      <P>What makes Lu's exploits these past few days all the more remarkable is that he
has done it without a coach or an authorized member of the tennis team with
access to Olympic venues.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's tennis association originally named doubles star Chan Yung-jan's father
and coach as the team's official coach and Lien Yu-hui, one of Taiwan's Davis
Cup mainstays in the late 1980s and early '90s, as the "P-card," or support
personnel.</P>
      <P>But the Sports Affairs Council, overturned the association's recommendation,
giving the "P-card" to the father of Chan's doubles partner Chuang Chia-jung.</P>
      <P>To compensate, the association paid for Lien to accompany Lu to Beijing, but
without the official "P-card" designation, Lien was not given access to any
Olympic venues.</P>
      <P>"Lu Yen-hsun even had to ask for help from the Chinese players to get court time
for him to practice and help him warm up," Lu's older brother Lu Wei-ru told the
Central News Agency. "I still have trouble accepting the decision. The women
already had Chan's father to work with them, while my brother had nobody who
could give him advice and practice with him."</P>
      <P>Lu Wei-ru said, however, that the decision may have inspired his brother to his
outstanding performance.</P>
      <P>The decision made Lu Yen-hsun want to show people that they need to take men's
tennis seriously. It may have added to his determination,Lu Wei-ru said.</P>
      <P>Lu's Olympic showing, and a run of strong performances by up-and-coming Tsung-
hua Yang, should be opening the eyes of local sports authorities.</P>
      <P>Lu Wei-ru laughed when it was suggested his brother has become known to more
Taiwanese in the past three days than since he turned pro in 2001, and said he
hoped his brother would continue his run of success at the U.S. Open.</P>

      <P>"Penghu's future seems gloomy, as it has become an outcast from increased cross-
strait exchanges ever since the central government launched direct weekend
charter flights between Taiwan proper and China from July 4, " Wang said at a
county council meeting, while giving a special report on potential business
opportunities for Penghu in direct cross-strait travel links.</P>
      <P>Although Penghu was designated as one of Taiwan's eight airports serving
inaugural weekend charter flights, Wang said that since then, no charter flights
have taken off from or landed on the island. That's made Penghu's tourism
industry especially concerned, he said.</P>
      <P>Without more weekend charters between the island and Chinese destinations, local
tourism-related businesses will be at a distinct disadvantage in competing with
other Taiwan cities and counties for Chinese tourist dollars.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the July 4 charter flights to and from Penghu were for religious
exchanges, not tourism. That day, 180 Buddhist pilgrims flew on a charter flight
from Penghu to Xiamen, while 263 Xiamen Buddhists flew into Penghu on the same
charter on the return trip.</P>
      <P>Wang suggested that the central government  permit Chinese tourists visiting
Penghu to proceed to Taiwan proper and allow those visiting Taiwan proper to
proceed to Penghu, as a means of helping the island attract more Chinese
tourists.</P>
      <P>The magistrate also urged the government to grant Chinese tourists 96-hour
landing visa privilege upon their arrival in Penghu, and allow them to travel on
their own instead of being required to join a group tour.</P>
      <P>According to county Councilor Yang Yao-wen, Penghu residents are facing economic
difficulties now that the Kuomintang (KMT) government has opened the doors wider
to China.</P>
      <P>Yang urged the central government to grant the Penghu Island the same status as
Kinmen and Matsu islands, which are authorized to conduct direct ferry services
with three ports in China's Fujian Province.</P>
      <P>Over the past eight years, the previous Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
administration regime was too passive in working to include Penghu in cross-
strait exchanges, he said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Vincent Siew said Wednesday at the 2008 Digital Cities Convention
in Taoyuan that narrowing the digital divide between urban and rural areas and
attracting business investment are the main goals of the government's "i-Taiwan
12 Projects."</P>
      <P>According to Siew, one of the programs will see the promotion of "intelligent
Taiwan" with the aim of creating a superb industrial environment through the
application of intelligent technology.</P>
      <P>The notion of a "mobile Taiwan" is also to be advanced, leading to the
establishment of "wireless cities," said Siew on the first day of the two-day
conference organized by the Taoyuan county government and held at Taoyuan County
Center for Women. Taipei Mayor Hau Ling-bin and Taoyuan Magistrate Eric Liluan
Chu also attended.</P>
      <P>Siew added that digital development is considered one of the most important
tasks in developing Taoyuan City into an international air transport logistics
hub -- one of the "i-Taiwan 12 Projects."</P>
      <P>According to the World Information Society Report 2007, Taiwan ranked No. 7 in
digital opportunities, with a No. 2 ranking in digital infrastructure, a No. 6
ranking in Internet opportunities, and a No. 23 ranking in digital information
applications.</P>
      <P>Judging from the statistics, Siew went on, the development of digital hardware
in Taiwan has matured over the last few years and the next step is to expand the
application of digital technology.</P>
      <P>He added that people not only need to work hard but also work smart in the
information age, adding that it is only through the use of intelligence that
added value will be increased in today's competitive environment.</P>
      <P>Siew further expressed hope that in the future, every city in Taiwan can be
equipped with broadband and wireless facilities, giving Internet access to all.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou and Vice President Vincent Siew received political
contributions amounting to NT$677.4 million (US$21.75 million) for their
presidential campaign, according to an official of the Control Yuan, a
government branch that monitors the integrity of civil servants and government
officials.</P>
      <P>Hsieh Yu-nan, director of the Control Yuan's Department of Asset Reports, said
the amount received by Ma and Siew, the Kuomintang ticket for the presidential
election in March, was computed for the period June 8, 2007 to April 21 this
year.</P>
      <P>A balance of NT$37.46 million remained after the presidential election,
including NT$15.28 million in assets like furniture and cars.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said the funds were computed for the period dating from when the bank
account was opened to when the contributions were reported.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Hsieh said, the Democratic Progressive Party presidential candidate
Frank Hsieh and his running mate Su Tsen-Chang received political contributions
totalling NT$404.03 million.</P>
      <P>The amount was computed for the period May 31, 2007 to April 13 this year. The
DPP ticket had an overdraft of NT$23.65 million after the election, and had no
non-liquid assets, the director said.</P>
      <P>The Political Contribution Act stipulates that candidates should report
political contributions within two months after elections to the relevant

    <TEXT>
      <P>The next four years will be crucial to the development  of  cross-strait
relations,  an official  of the quasi-official Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF)
said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>SEF Vice Chairman and Secretary-general Kao Koong-lien, noting that Chinese
leader Hu Jintao's second term will expire in 2012, said Hu will seek to leave a
legacy.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, President Ma Ying-jeou will seek his second term in four years' time,
and he will need to present a credible performance to ensure reelection, Kao
added.</P>
      <P>Kao made the remarks during a speech on the development of cross-strait trade
relations and the outlook for the future, at a party given by a visiting
delegation from China's Fudan University.</P>
      <P>"The signing of a cross-strait agreement and a comprehensive economic
cooperation agreement (CECA) between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait will be
crucial to the development of cross-strait relations," he said.</P>
      <P>The signing  of the CECA will prevent  Taiwan from being marginalized and will
help create a win-win situation through the normalization of cross-strait trade,
he said.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that peaceful and stable cross-strait relations will help to
boost Taiwan's development and also help to maintain stability in China.</P>
      <P>"Cross-strait relations are key to peace and stability in East Asia," he added.</P>
      <P>North Korea is currently the powder keg in East Asia, Kao noted, adding that he
does not want to see the Taiwan Strait turn into a second flash point.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that relations across the Taiwan Strait have warmed up since the
resumption of cross-strait talks in June, and said he hoped that the cordial
relations will continue to develop so that the Taiwan Strait will not become a
powder keg in South Asia or a "trouble maker in the international community."</P>
      <P>Kao also said that bilateral trade across the Taiwan Strait had increased in
three decades from less than US$100 million to more than US$100 billion in 2007.</P>
      <P>Addressing concerns that over-reliance on China could lead to a situation in
which products "made in Taiwan" would gradually be replaced by "made in China"
brands, Kao said there is no need for such worries.</P>
      <P>Cross-strait trade figures have clearly shown that the "made in China" products
are in essence "made by Taiwanese in China," he said.</P>
      <P>But he also suggested that Taiwan upgrade its economy by enhancing research and
design on one hand and moving toward high value-added industries such as the
development of brands, marketing and distribution on the other.</P>
      <P>With upgraded traditional industries and emerging and service industries, Taiwan
may create another economic miracle, he said.</P>
      <P>On the cross-strait deregulations scheduled for next year, Kao said that the
major initiatives will include permitting domestic banks to set up branches and
subsidiaries in China and to make direct investments, allowing Chinese capital
in Taiwan banks, permitting Taiwan schools to sign alliance agreements with
their Chinese counterparts, and extending the time that Chinese students are
allowed to study in Taiwan from the current four months to one year.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau (MJIB) denied Wednesday that it has
ever received notices from Singapore  and the United States about former
President  Chen Shui-bian's alleged remittance of NT$300 million (US$9.62
million) overseas in 2006 through his family for the purposes of laundering
money.</P>
      <P>The MJIB issued the statement after the Next weekly tabloid reported in its
latest issue that the Egmont Group, an international anti-money laundering
organization, had informed the bureau through the United States and Singapore
that former first lady Wu Shu-jen had closed bank accounts belonging to her and
her husband as well as several others in 2006, soon after the exposure of a
"state affairs fund case." The magazine claimed that the accounts were created
under the names of Wu's son Chen Chih-chung and her daughter Chen Hsing-yu and
were used for stock trading.</P>
      <P>Wu also remitted an amount totaling NT$300 million overseas through various bank
accounts belonging to her daughter-in-law Huang Jui-ching and her family after
the state affairs fund scandal broke, according to the magazine.</P>
      <P>It further said the situation was discovered when prosecutors were scrutinizing
the bank accounts of the former first family as part of their probe into the
high-profile embezzlement case.</P>
      <P>Wu was charged with corruption and forgery in November 2006 for allegedly using
receipts provided by others to claim reimbursements totaling NT$14.8 million
from the president's "state affairs fund" between July 2002 and March 2006.</P>
      <P>The MJIB statement said the Next report was not factual, and insisted  that the
bureau had not received  any notices from Singaporean or U.S. authorities about
the alleged remittance of money by the country's former first family.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the statement said, prosecutors have not directed the MJIB's anti-
money laundering center to investigate the former first family's overseas bank
accounts.</P>
      <P>Responding to the Next report, a spokesman for the Supreme Prosecutors Office's
Special Investigation Task Force said the panel has probed the domestic and
overseas bank accounts of all those involved in the suspected "state affairs
fund" embezzlement case. Nevertheless, the spokesman said, the panel has no
knowledge of the alleged transactions mentioned in the tabloid report.</P>
      <P>Dismissing the tabloid report through opposition Democratic Progressive  Party
Legislator Gao Jyh-peng and his lawyer Lee Sheng-chen, Chen said earlier in the
day that the article was a conspiracy engineered by prosecutors to try to sway
public opinion over the "state affairs  fund" case that is currently  under
investigation.</P>
      <P>According to Gao, the report obviously "goes against common sense" because the
assets of the former first family were held in trust during Chen's presidency,
which would have prevented the family members from managing the assets on their
own.</P>
      <P>"Had the trust been canceled (before Chen's term ended in May 2008), everyone
would have known about it long ago," Gao said.</P>
      <P>Chen, who had immunity from prosecution while in office, was named as a co-
defendant in the "state affairs fund" case as soon as he stepped down from the
presidency May 20.</P>
      <P>On Tuesday, he was questioned by prosecutors for the second time since July.</P>

      <P>First lady Chow Mei-ching visited a remote aboriginal community in the eastern
county of Hualien Wednesday to meet a teenager whom President Ma Ying-jeou has
been sponsoring for seven years.</P>
      <P>It was the third time since late July that the self-effacing first lady has
traveled to remote tribal communities in areas far away from metropolitan Taipei
to meet disadvantaged children. All three visits were arranged by World Vision
Taiwan (WVT), a Christian charity dedicated to helping local and foreign
children and families in need.</P>
      <P>As in the past, Chow, a financial law expert who retired from a high-paid
banking job just after her husband assumed the presidency in May, kept a low-
profile on her Hualien visit in the company of WVT staff.</P>
      <P>Besides meeting with the Ma-sponsored  boy,  identified as Hsiaohui, Chow also
attended a WVT-organized seminar on children's character education during her
Hualien visit, said the WVT in a press statement.</P>
      <P>Chow presented  Hsiaohui many gifts,  including an English dictionary and books
on English grammar and sentence patterns. Knowing that Hsiaohui likes painting,
Chow also gave him,  a 14-year-old junior high school student, watercolor paints
and brush pens as well as school stationery items, the statement said.</P>
      <P>According to the statement, Chow was impressed by daylilies and many other
dazzling indigenous  plants and vegetables  in the aboriginal Talanpu community,
which used to be known as a "dark village" because it didn't have power supply
until a few years ago.</P>
      <P>After seeing for herself several community development projects there, the
statement said Chow expressed her hope that local schools can include more
traditional cultural education courses in their curricula.</P>
      <P>Chow made the suggestion because she believes that aboriginal children should be
taught the rich cultural legacies left by their tribal ancestors, the statement
said.</P>
      <P>The first lady also suggested that aboriginal school teachers be given intensive
training in aboriginal culture and customs so that they can help young tribal
children better understand their own culture, the statement added.</P>

      <P>The incoming Paraguayan government will maintain diplomatic relations with the
Republic of China on Taiwan, the ROC ambassador to the South American country
said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Amb. Hu Cheng-yao made the remarks in a telephone interview with CNA a few hours
before the arrival of ROC President Ma Ying-jeou in Asuncion  to attend  the
Aug.  15 inauguration  of Paraguayan President-elect Fernando Lugo.</P>
      <P>Lugo, a former leftist bishop, once said on campaign trail that if he won the
presidency, his administration would switch diplomatic allegiance from Taipei to
Beijing. But Hu said Lugo has promised to maintain official ties with Taiwan
after he won the presidential election in April this year.</P>
      <P>Hu said he met with Lugo Tuesday. During the meeting, Hu said, Lugo  reiterated
his  determination  to uphold  his country's longstanding cordial ties with
Taiwan after assuming office later this week.</P>
      <P>For his part, Hu said he assured Lugo that the ROC government will continue to
assist Paraguay in agricultural development, land reform and construction of
public housing units.</P>
      <P>On his first state visit since taking office May 20, President Ma will attend
the inauguration ceremonies of Lugo on Aug. 15 and Dominican Republic President-
elect Leonel Fernandez on Aug. 16. Ma's eight-day overseas visit is seen as a
bid to cement ties with Paraguay and the Caribbean country and a test of whether
Taiwan and China will set aside their competition in the international arena.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Next 4 years crucial to development of cross-strait ties: SEF</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 13 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The next four years will be crucial to the development  of  cross-strait
relations,  an official  of the quasi-official Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF)
said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>SEF Vice Chairman and Secretary-general Kao Koong-lien, noting that Chinese
leader Hu Jintao's second term will expire in 2012, said Hu will seek to leave a
legacy.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, President Ma Ying-jeou will seek his second term in four years' time,
and he will need to present a credible performance to ensure reelection, Kao
added.</P>
      <P>Kao made the remarks during a speech on the development of cross-strait trade
relations and the outlook for the future, at a party given by a visiting
delegation from China's Fudan University.</P>
      <P>"The signing of a cross-strait agreement and a comprehensive economic
cooperation agreement (CECA) between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait will be
crucial to the development of cross-strait relations," he said.</P>
      <P>The signing  of the CECA will prevent  Taiwan from being marginalized and will
help create a win-win situation through the normalization of cross-strait trade,
he said.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that peaceful and stable cross-strait relations will help to
boost Taiwan's development and also help to maintain stability in China.</P>
      <P>"Cross-strait relations are key to peace and stability in East Asia," he added.</P>
      <P>North Korea is currently the powder keg in East Asia, Kao noted, adding that he
does not want to see the Taiwan Strait turn into a second flash point.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that relations across the Taiwan Strait have warmed up since the
resumption of cross-strait talks in June, and said he hoped that the cordial
relations will continue to develop so that the Taiwan Strait will not become a
powder keg in South Asia or a "trouble maker in the international community."</P>
      <P>Kao also said that bilateral trade across the Taiwan Strait had increased in
three decades from less than US$100 million to more than US$100 billion in 2007.</P>
      <P>Addressing concerns that over-reliance on China could lead to a situation in
which products "made in Taiwan" would gradually be replaced by "made in China"
brands, Kao said there is no need for such worries.</P>
      <P>Cross-strait trade figures have clearly shown that the "made in China" products
are in essence "made by Taiwanese in China," he said.</P>
      <P>But he also suggested that Taiwan upgrade its economy by enhancing research and
design on one hand and moving toward high value-added industries such as the
development of brands, marketing and distribution on the other.</P>
      <P>With upgraded traditional industries and emerging and service industries, Taiwan
may create another economic miracle, he said.</P>
      <P>On the cross-strait deregulations scheduled for next year, Kao said that the
major initiatives will include permitting domestic banks to set up branches and
subsidiaries in China and to make direct investments, allowing Chinese capital
in Taiwan banks, permitting Taiwan schools to sign alliance agreements with
their Chinese counterparts, and extending the time that Chinese students are
allowed to study in Taiwan from the current four months to one year.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Vincent Siew said Wednesday at the 2008 Digital Cities Convention
in Taoyuan that narrowing the digital divide between urban and rural areas and
attracting business investment are the main goals of the government's "i-Taiwan
12 Projects."</P>
      <P>According to Siew, one of the programs will see the promotion of "intelligent
Taiwan" with the aim of creating a superb industrial environment through the
application of intelligent technology.</P>
      <P>The notion of a "mobile Taiwan" is also to be advanced, leading to the
establishment of "wireless cities," said Siew on the first day of the two-day
conference organized by the Taoyuan county government and held at Taoyuan County
Center for Women. Taipei Mayor Hau Ling-bin and Taoyuan Magistrate Eric Liluan
Chu also attended.</P>
      <P>Siew added that digital development is considered one of the most important
tasks in developing Taoyuan City into an international air transport logistics
hub -- one of the "i-Taiwan 12 Projects."</P>
      <P>According to the World Information Society Report 2007, Taiwan ranked No. 7 in
digital opportunities, with a No. 2 ranking in digital infrastructure, a No. 6
ranking in Internet opportunities, and a No. 23 ranking in digital information
applications.</P>
      <P>Judging from the statistics, Siew went on, the development of digital hardware
in Taiwan has matured over the last few years and the next step is to expand the
application of digital technology.</P>
      <P>He added that people not only need to work hard but also work smart in the
information age, adding that it is only through the use of intelligence that
added value will be increased in today's competitive environment.</P>
      <P>Siew further expressed hope that in the future, every city in Taiwan can be
equipped with broadband and wireless facilities, giving Internet access to all.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Arrangements for U.S. transit stops very appropriate:president</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Panama,  Aug. 13 (CNA)
08/14/08  12:04:08
(By Rachel Chan)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Wednesday his low profile transit stop in L.A. en
route to Latin America on his first state visit since he took office in May was
very much appreciated by the United States and served as an important step to
mend mutual trust between the two countries.</P>
      <P>"The transit stop arrangements (in Los Angeles) were very appropriate and were
highly appreciated by the U.S. authorities, " Ma said aboard a charter flight
from Los Angeles to Paraguay.</P>
      <P>This (low profile transit stop) would allow them build faith in Taiwan, and that
is very important, " the president said, adding that "I believe it will be to
very good effect if we take one step at a time."</P>
      <P>Ma noted that in planning the trip, Taiwan made no requests for a stopover on
the East Coast of the U.S. or to engage in any activity that would conflict with
the purpose of a transit stop. This approach was taken to allow for the mending
of mutual trust between Taiwan and the U.S., which had eroded over the past
years, he said.</P>
      <P>Ma's predecessor  Chen Shui-bian  often used state visits, including transits
through the U.S., to shift Taiwan's political struggle over its identity to a
broader international stage -- a practice that often displeased the U.S.</P>
      <P>Ma arrived in Los Angeles on Aug. 12 local time where he made a transit stop en
route to Paraguay and the Dominican Republic. He is slated to attend the
inauguration of Paraguayan President-elect Fernando Lugo on Aug. 15 and of
Dominican Republic President-elect Leonel Fernandez on Aug. 16.</P>
      <P>In keeping with his desire not to create any waves during his U.S. overnight
stopover, the president did not leave his hotel. However, he met with four U.S.
congressmen and had telephone conversations with four senators and six other
congressmen.</P>
      <P>He also attended a dinner held by Taiwanese expatriates. Other guests at the
dinner included 50 overseas Taiwanese leaders, some of Ma's American friends and
some U.S. congressmen. The president also met with several Taiwanese
international students.</P>
      <P>Asked whether  he had made contact  with anyone from the presidential campaigns
of Democratic candidate Barack Obama or Republican candidate John McCain, Ma
said cryptically that he had "met and talked with the people he was supposed to
meet and talk with."</P>
      <P>The president also told reporters that he is keeping tabs on the performance of
Taiwan's Olympic team in Beijing.</P>
      <P>"The 5-0 victory of the Taiwanese baseball team over the Netherlands on
Wednesday (Taipei time) shows that our players are extraordinary and I was very
excited when I was notified of the victory," Ma said.</P>
      <P>Ma said that he hopes other Taiwanese Olympics athletes will also perform well
so that his visit to the training camp in southern Taiwan to boost morale among
the athletes before he left for South America and the Caribbean would not have
been in vain.</P>

      <P>The government is planning to extend the maximum stay in Taiwan by Chinese
students from the current four months to one year, as part of its efforts to
encourage cross-Taiwan Strait exchanges, Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) Vice
Chairman Kao Koong-lian said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The long-stalled issues concerning the recognition of academic qualifications
awarded by Chinese schools will only be addressed after that, Kao said.</P>
      <P>"But the opening to students would not be unlimited, in light of the non-uniform
quality of schools in China," he said.</P>
      <P>While the Chinese government  has long recognized academic qualifications
awarded by Taiwanese  schools,  Taiwan has not reciprocated, mainly because the
Taiwan government lacks sufficient information about the academic system in
China and the quality of Chinese schools, he noted.</P>
      <P>Kao made the remarks in response to questions by the media on the government's
policy on cross-strait educational exchanges.</P>
      <P>Kao was participating in the opening ceremony of a Taipei workshop organized by
the SEF for Taiwan students studying at higher education institutions in China.</P>
      <P>In his opening address, Kao expressed his support for a proposal to promote dual
degree programs and mutual recognition of academic credits between Taiwanese and
Chinese universities.</P>
      <P>Such measures will allow universities from both sides of the Taiwan Strait to
share their merits and will expand the opportunities for students to make
friends, according to Kao.</P>
      <P>He said that compared with three months ago, cross-strait relations have
improved significantly thanks to the increase in cross-strait interactions,
especially in terms of economic, trade and cultural exchanges.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Kao stressed the importance of establishing a viable channel of
communication across the strait and again proposed that Taiwan and China
establish reciprocal representative offices to more effectively address problems
encountered by both sides in dealing with each other.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Foreign Minister Francisco H.L. Ou said Wednesday that the warm welcome
President Ma Ying-jeou received from his Panamanian counterpart, President
Martin Torrijos, in Panama City during a refueling stop en route to South
American and the Caribbean can serve as an indicator that bilateral relations
between Taiwan and Panama are very good.</P>
      <P>Ma arrived in Panama City around 2: 45 p.m. local time and was given a red
carpet welcome that included a military guard of honor and the playing of the
national anthems of the Republic of China and Panama. Dozens of Taiwanese
expatriates were also at the airport to greet the president.</P>
      <P>Ma and Torrijos held a meeting at the airport in which they discussed bilateral
cooperation and exchanged views on economic and energy saving issues.</P>
      <P>"When we requested a refueling stop in Panama, (the authorities) expressed their
warmest assent and immediately responded that the president would like to meet
with us, " Ou said. "This shows that bilateral relations are very good.</P>
      <P>Ou made the remarks aboard a charter flight from Panama to Paraguay, where Ma
will make his first state visit since he took office May 20. Ma will attend the
inauguration of Paraguayan President-elect Fernando Lugo on Aug. 15.</P>
      <P>Ma was the first head of state from Taiwan to visit Panama since Sep.1, 2004,
when his predecessor Chen Shui-bian attended the inauguration ceremony of the
incumbent Panamanian President Martin Torrijos.</P>
      <P>Bilateral relations between Taiwan and Panama seemed to be wavering during the
final years of Chens administration, as Chen stuck to a diplomatic approach that
China saw as confrontational, while Panama tried to develop economic and trade
relations with China.</P>
      <P>The Panamanian government rejected Chen's request for a stopover in Oct. 2007, a
decision that was interpreted by many analysts as an indicator of unstable
diplomatic ties.</P>
      <P>Although Ma's short stop in Panama on his way to Paraguay was for refueling
purposes, it was generally viewed as a major effort by Taiwan to consolidate its
ties with the central American country which has been a Republic of China ally
since 1909.</P>
      <P>Unlike most of Taiwan's other allies, Panama in recent years has withheld
support for Taiwan's bid to participate in the World Health Organization and the
United Nations.</P>
      <P>Ou, however, contended that this was the result of a longstanding diplomatic
tug-of-war between Taiwan and China. Now that the new Taiwan government has
adopted a different diplomatic approach from the previous administration, the
ties with Panama are getting stronger, he added.</P>
      <P>"It is easier for our allies and other countries with which we do not have
diplomatic relations to voice their support for Taiwan's participation in
international organizations if Taipei and Beijing can set aside their problems,"
the foreign minister said.</P>
      <P>He said Ma's proposal to seek a "diplomatic truce" with China was well received
by the Panamanian president, who described the approach as a "wise" one.</P>
      <P>Ma has stressed many times that China and Taiwan should stop their "meaningless
competition" in the international community, and that the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait should terminate their efforts to poach each other's allies by
offering large sums of foreign aid funds.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou's proposal to seek a "diplomatic truce" with China and

said Ma also expressed Taiwan's interest in assisting Panama with its plan to
widen the Panama Canal and voiced the hope that Taiwanese businesses could
participate in the project.</P>
      <P>Ma was the first head of state from Taiwan to visit Panama since Sept.1, 2004,
when his predecessor Chen Shui-bian attended the Torrijos' inauguration.</P>
      <P>Wang said that Ma invited his Panamanian counterpart to pay a state visit to
Taiwan, and that Torrijos agreed to do so if there was a chance in the future.</P>
      <P>Panama has been an ally of the Republic of China since 1909, but has maintained
close business links with China. Rumors have abounded for a long time that the
Central American country is swaying between Taiwan and China, in terms of its
diplomatic leanings.</P>
      <P>Although Ma's short stop in Panama on his way to Paraguay was for refueling
purposes, it was generally viewed as a step toward improving the sometimes
lukewarm diplomatic relations and cementing ties in general with the Central
American country.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou, on arrival in Paraguay around 11: 30 p.m. local time,
was given a high-level state welcome, with a red carpet, a guard of honor and
hundreds of overseas Taiwanese waiting to greet him.</P>
      <P>Before he disembarked from the charter plane, Ma was greeted by director-general
of the Paraguayan foreign ministry's Department of Protocol and by David Hu,
Taiwan's ambassador to Paraguay. He then disembarked and walked along a red
carpet with a military honor guard lined up on both sides, to be received
formally by Paraguayan Interior Minister Libio Florentin and his wife.</P>
      <P>The minute Ma stepped off the Miami Airlines charter flight, around 300 hundred
Taiwanese expatriates, who were lined up along the red carpet, began waving
national flags of the Republic of China and calling out, "Greetings, President
Ma."</P>
      <P>Lin Shih-wei, first secretary of the Republic of China's Embassy in Paraguay,
told the Central News Agency that many of the expatriates were from nearby
countries such as Chili and Argentina, and that some had traveled to Paraguay a
few days earlier just to greet Ma.</P>
      <P>The purpose of Ma's first state visit since he took office May 20 is to attend
the inaugurations of Paraguayan President-elect Fernando Lugo on Aug. 15 and
Dominican Republic President-elect Leonel Fernandez on Aug. 16.</P>
      <P>After acknowledging  and shaking  hands with the Taiwanese expatriates, Ma
delivered a three minute speech at the airport, saying that he was deeply moved
by the warm welcome, especially in light of the fact that he had arrived close
to midnight.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan and Paraguay have had 51 years of deep and solid friendship, " Ma said.
"I would like to take this opportunity to consolidate our diplomatic relations
and further develop the existing bilateral cooperation.</P>
      <P>Noting that the outgoing Paraguayan President Nicanor Duarte had visited Taiwan
twice and that former Taiwan President Chen Shui-bian and former Vice President
Annette Lu had also visited Paraguay, Ma said the links between the two
countries are "very close"</P>
      <P>Lugo had said many times that he would like to switch diplomatic recognition to
China -- a statement that spurred speculations that Taiwan might lose its only
diplomatic ally in South America.</P>
      <P>Media reports from Paraguay said that the country's  Vice President-elect
Federico Franco has requested US$71 million in foreign aid from Taiwan and has
threatened to sever ties with Taiwan before Lugo's inauguration if it does not
receive the funding.</P>
      <P>Lugo, however, told the Asuncion-based ABC Color daily news Tuesday that his
government will maintain ties with Taipei -- a message that was welcomed by
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Since President Ma Ying-jeou took office on May 20, he has sought an end to the
longstanding diplomatic tug-of-war with China, in which both sides compete for
recognition by giving large sums of money to developing countries desperate for
funds, a practice that critics call checkbook diplomacy.</P>
      <P>Speaking to reporters on the charter flight from Los Angeles to Paraguay after
making a refueling stop in Panama, Foreign Minister Francisco H.L. Ou said he
did not know what made Lugo change his statement, adding that Taiwan welcomed
the assurance.</P>
      <P>"The foreign ministry's  stance is that any new bilateral cooperation between
Taiwan and its allies must be project-oriented, and the ministry will make
evaluations before deciding whether to approve foreign aid," Ou said.</P>
      <P>From now on, Ou said, he will ask the ministry to monitor all foreign aid and
will grant funds depending on the efficiency with which these projects are
implemented.</P>
      <P>However, "it is the transfer of technology and experience that is most effective
in helping these countries," Ou added.</P>

      <P>The Kaohsiung Journal of Medical Sciences, a publication of Kaohsiung Medical
University in southern Taiwan, has been accepted for indexing and abstracting in
the Science Citation Index Expanded (SCIE), an international, multidisciplinary
index of journal literature of the sciences.</P>
      <P>At a ceremony at the university Wednesday, Yu Hsin-su, president of the
university, accepted a certificate of accreditation from Garry Liang, regional
head of the scientific business of Thomson Reuters in Taiwan and Hong Kong,
which publishes the SCIE.</P>
      <P>Yu said that he was pleased to see the journal, established in 1985, being
covered in SCIE, along with a few professional journals in the country and about
7,000 others worldwide.</P>
      <P>The medical journal is aimed at promoting clinical and scientific research in
the medical sciences in Taiwan, and disseminating this research to the
international community of medical and health care professionals, according to
Yu.</P>
      <P>The periodical is published monthly by Elsevier (Singapore) Pte Ltd, and
solicits research papers in medicine from around the globe. It has published
papers submitted by Indian, Japanese, Iranian and Iraqi academics.</P>
      <P>Its subscriptions have reached some 1,000, while an additional 400 copies are
usually  sent out in journal  exchanges  with universities in the United States,
Japan, China and Hong Kong, Yu noted.</P>
      <P>The magazine serves as the main source of medical information in southern Taiwan
and its reports have often been cited by domestic media outlets. It continues to
retain Chinese extracts, although the journal was revised in 1997 and has been
published in English since then.</P>
      <P>The academic periodical offers prizes in two categories for excellent papers, in
order to encourage medical researchers to contribute reports on their findings,
Yue said.</P>
      <P>The journal has won two awards from the Ministry of Education for teaching
excellence and outstanding research achievements, Yu added.</P>
      <P>In the near future,  the journal's goal will be to seek sustainability by
creating a platform for medical experts in Asia and medically emerging countries
to present their research results in the areas of acute and chronic diseases,
according to Yu.</P>
      <P>He expressed hope that the periodical will be upgraded and promoted overseas and
will be able to employ academics from abroad to work as editors.</P>
      <P>Yu also said there are plans to issue a regular special edition that will cover
themes such education, sciences and health reform, as well as issues related to
environmental medicine, tropical medicine, health and behavioral sciences,
national health insurance, health policies and medical education.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan government's  National Development Fund (NDF) has decided to make its
first investment in a local film to help boost the country's cultural industry.</P>
      <P>The management of the NDF announced in a statement Monday that it will sponsor
Taiwanese filmmaker Hou Hsiao-hsien's science-fiction kung fu film, Nie Yin
Niang, to the tune of NT$81.6 million (US$2.6 million).</P>
      <P>The NDF made the decision based on the recommendation of the Cabinet-level
Government Information Office (GIO), which oversees the country's film industry,
GIO Deputy Minister Albert Lin said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Lin noted that it is the first time that the GIO has made such a recommendation,
adding that his office has also offered an additional grant of NT$15 million to
the world-renowned director.</P>
      <P>The production will cost an estimated NT$270 million, the highest ever in
Taiwan's film industry, he said.</P>
      <P>The shooting of the film is slated to begin this year and to be completed in
2010.</P>
      <P>The government has decided to make the investments as it hopes that the
production would help to expand Taiwan's film industry, widen its
commercialization and draw higher box office sales, he said.</P>
      <P>Traditionally, the government has used national development funds to boost local
industries, with most of the money being invested in Taiwan's high tech
industry, Lin said, citing as an example Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.
(TSMC) , now the world's largest contract chipmaker.</P>
      <P>If the government's investment in the film proves successful, this will help
substantially to expand Taiwan's cultural sector, Lin forecast.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's film market has been dominated by Hollywood movies over the years,
although there have been several Taiwanese films that have won international
awards.</P>
      <P>The GIO often subsidizes local films, but according to Lin, the GIO will focus
more on box office performance in the future.</P>
      <P>It is believed that Hou's strong production team and the film's business-
oriented plot based on an ancient Chinese novel will help to earn high revenues
overseas, Lin said.</P>
      <P>Hou's films have won awards at international festivals, including the Venice
Film Festival and Berlin Film Festival.</P>

      <P>Taiwan will establish a cross-Taiwan Strait platform to promote exchanges and
cooperation between local and Chinese industries, in order to jointly explore
global business opportunities, Minister of Economic Affairs Yiin Chii-ming said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>This will serve as a bridge between enterprises on both sides of the strait, "
Yiin said, adding that the various industry sectors would be able to work hand-
in-hand in the areas of manufacturing, research development, and marketing.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a press conference after a Cabinet meeting, Yiin said companies
would even be able to launch joint ventures to access the mainland market.</P>
      <P>In one of the Cabinet's key moves to boost Taiwan's industrial competitiveness,
the platform is being established to explore global business by attracting
international companies to take part in multilateral industrial cooperation,
Yiin said.</P>
      <P>"With the participation of multinational enterprises, industries across the
strait could come up with new operational patterns that would lead to more
business opportunities," he said.</P>
      <P>The platform, to be implemented by the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA), is
part the Kuomintang government's bid to deregulate cross-strait economic
exchanges, following its raising of the cap on China-bound investment by local
enterprises from 40 percent to 60 percent of their net worth, in July.</P>
      <P>Yiin said that during first year of the latest initiative, the efforts will
focus on getting companies from both sides to know each other.</P>
      <P>In December a seminar will be held to facilitate strategic alliance in the field
of Chinese herbal medicine," the minister said, indicating that this will mark
the launch of the measure.</P>
      <P>The series of the seminars, to run from 2008 to 2009, will include industries
such as solar photovoltaic,  electric motor, aviation. textiles and fibers,
telecommunication,  and cycling, according to the MOEA.</P>
      <P>Each of these seminars will be attended by representatives of 200 to 300
companies, including 40 to 50 Chinese firms, Yiin said.</P>
      <P>During the second and third years of the initiative, the MOEA will push for more
substantial business cooperation, Yiin said, but he did not specify the areas of
the cooperation.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Yiin said that during the period January to July, Taiwan attracted
NT$810.1 billion (US$26.13 billion) in private investment, about 75 percent of
the annual target of NT$1.08 trillion from private capital.</P>
      <P>"We should be able to meet that target, " Yiin said, adding that his ministry
estimates that private domestic investment for the next four years could surpass
NT$4 trillion.</P>

      <P>The program, to run from Aug. 15 to Nov. 30, is expected to give away up to 50

    <HEADLINE>Group urges public to practice safe 'ghost money' burning</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Environmental groups and academics on Thursday urged the public to collectively
burn "ghost money" in environmentally-friendly incinerators run by local
governments or temples during Friday's "Ghost Festival."</P>
      <P>According to the Environmental Resources Development Foundation, temples around
Taiwan burned an average of nearly 35,000 metric tons of ghost money and 4,190
metric tons of incense each year for the past three years. That figure does not
include ghost money burnt in homes and private shops.</P>
      <P>Government officials said that ideally no ghost money would be burnt at all,
because the process releases toxic chemicals that pose a health risk.  Officials
from the Cabinet-level Environmental Protection Administration's Department of
Air Quality Protection and Noise Control said burning ghost money releases
benzene -- a carcinogen -- and other pollutants.</P>
      <P>Wu Chia-cheng, chairman of the Consumers Foundation and a chemistry professor at
National Taiwan Normal University, said that most of the incense and ghost paper
money for sale in Taiwan is imported from Southeast Asian countries. Almost all
such imported ghost money falls short of environmental protection standards, he
said.</P>
      <P>Many prominent religious groups in Taiwan, such as Fo Guang Shan Monastery,
Longshan Temple, the Buddhist Compassion Relief Tzu Chi Foundation and the
Dharma Drum Mountain Culture and Education Foundation, have dropped the
tradition of burning ghost money in order to protect the environment, foundation
officials said.</P>
      <P>In recent years, several city and county governments have offered to collect
and burn ghost money on behalf of residents  in environmentally-friendly mass
incinerators. Some temples have also installed more environmentally safe
furnaces for burning the sacrificial money.</P>
      <P>"Ghost Festival" falls on the 15th day of the seventh lunar month, which is
known as "Ghost month." According to traditional Chinese folk belief, souls are
released from hell during this month to freely wander the earth.</P>
      <P>Burning ghost money began as a ritual to "bribe" such spirits so they don't
create mischief or harm. Believers burn money year-round, but the activity
reaches a peak during Ghost Month, and especially on the 15th day of the month.</P>
      <P>In addition to curbing the use of ghost money, environmental groups hope to push
temples and religious devotees to burn less or no incense while worshipping,
foundation officials said.</P>

      <P>Total suspended particulate (TSP) emissions at construction sites in Yunlin
County have dropped 47.3 percent following the implementation in April of air
pollution regulations at the sites, the county government's Environmental
Protection Bureau said Thursday.</P>
      <P>According to the department, TSP emissions at construction sites in the southern
county were recorded at 2,502 tons between April and July, down by 1,182 tons
from the level for the previous three months.</P>
      <P>Under the air pollution plan, the bureau has stepped up TSP testing at the
county's construction sites, as well as inspections to determine whether
companies are following various related regulations, including dust clean-up and
greening of open areas at the sites.</P>
      <P>The bureau said it conducted more than 950 spot checks at over 750 construction
sites in the county during the April-July period, and issued over 30 fines for
violations of the regulations, including eight for excessive TSP levels at
tested sites.</P>

      <P>A prisoner in Hualien County, eastern Taiwan, has passed the entrance
examination for a national college with a score substantially higher than the
threshold, a Ministry of Justice (MOJ) official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>According to the official of the MOJ's Department of Corrections, the 37-year-
old inmate, identified by the pseudonym Lee, scored 220.8 in the national exam,
surpassing  many students who are not incarcerated. This year's lowest score for
entering a college was registered at 7.69.</P>
      <P>Lee was sentenced to 14 years for collecting payments for illegal loansharks
with violence in 1996 at the age of 26, at which point he had only an elementary
education, the official said.</P>
      <P>According to a prison official, Lee did not show much inclination to pursue his
education until his father's accidental death in 2000. He acquired the admission
to a school at the prison in 2002 and completed his junior and senior high
school education in the ensuing years.</P>
      <P>Lee's mother moved to Hualien County in 2003 and visits him twice a week to
offer support for him. He has returned top scores every semester, the official
said.</P>
      <P>Despite the fact that Lee passed the entrance exam, he still has three more
years to serve.</P>
      <P>The MOJ has ruled out the possibility of allowing Lee to attend classes under
guard and protection, as it would mean he would suffer serious discrimination
from society, according to the official.</P>
      <P>Justice Minister Wang Ching-feng said Lee can apply for parole this month and if
the application is approved, he will be able to start his college life at the
National Hualien University of Education.</P>
      <P>Wang expressed hope that Lee and other prisoners who pass the entrance exam will
be able to study at colleges like ordinary students and that society will accept
them.</P>
      <P>In addition to Lee, another 12 prison inmates passed this year's college

      <P>Taiwanese traditional hand puppets and France's Guignol puppet tradition will
share the stage in a play titled La Boite (The Box) at the 10th Taipei Arts
Festival, telling a story of an intercultural voyage beyond the language
barrier, Philippe Auchere, director of the Compagnie des Zonzons -- a French
puppet theater group -- announced Thursday.</P>
      <P>In the trilingual play performed in French, Mandarin and Hoklo, a Taiwanese
dialect, the audience will enjoy the rare experience of exchange of the two
different cultures through the blending of Chinese hand puppets and the French
Guignol puppets, as well as a musical amalgamation of accordion,  harp and
Nanguan,  a wind instrument that originated in southern China.</P>
      <P>La Boite refers to the boxes in which the puppets are kept, the two theater
companies explained at a press conference, adding that the play is like a gift
box waiting to be opened and leads the audience on an intercultural journey.</P>
      <P>"The play is more an intercultural voyage than a story, it is about sharing and
communications, an acceptance of each other such as they are, " said Auchere to
CNA reporter, adding that spectators will play a role of witnesses of the exotic
encounter.</P>
      <P>He said that at the start of the collaboration, the two groups had difficulty
communicating due to the language barrier, but as they worked together, they
finally found a common language -- art.</P>
      <P>The project was first initiated in 2005 and was finally brought to the stage in
Lyon, France in April to celebrate Guignol's 200th birthday, winning an
overwhelming response from audiences.</P>
      <P>Guignol is a traditional puppet created by Laurent Mourguet in 1808 in Lyon.</P>
      <P>The Chinese hand puppet originated in 17th Century Fujian Province in southern
China.</P>
      <P>La Boite will be performed Aug. 15-17, at the Zhongshan Hall in Taipei City,

    <TEXT>
      <P>Former President Chen Shui-bian on Thursday said that his wife Wu Shu-jen had
wired abroad an unspecified amount of money that Chen had received as campaign
contributions.</P>
      <P>The surprise announcement is likely to add to Chen's legal woes, since it comes
as the former president is already battling charges that he misused public
funds.</P>
      <P>In a televised news conference, Chen apologized to the public for not clearly
accounting for his campaign contributions, saying the failure to make such a
report was "something that is not permitted by the law."</P>
      <P>But he insisted his wife had made the wire transfers without his knowledge, and
argued that at the time he received the campaign donations there was no law
requiring he report their receipt.</P>
      <P>Chen said the funds wired abroad were left over from four of his campaigns --
two for Taipei mayor and two for the presidency, the last one in 2004.</P>
      <P>Chen said that his wife had stashed the funds overseas in case he needed them
after he stepped down from the presidency on May 20. He said he only learned
about the transfers earlier this year, and then decided he would use the funds
in the future for Taiwan's diplomacy.</P>
      <P>He denied that there was any link between the funds his wife wired abroad and
the recent scandal over a botched attempt to win Papua New Guinea as a
diplomatic ally.</P>
      <P>He said many prominent politicians besides him also had failed to fully report
campaign funds.</P>
      <P>Under Taiwan's campaign laws, candidates are required to report campaign
spending. But candidates were not required to report all political donations
until the passage of the Political Contributions Act in 2004.</P>
      <P>Chen made his announcement one day after the Next Weekly tabloid reported  that
the Egmont Group,  an international  anti-money laundering network, had alerted
Taiwan authorities that the former first lady had made large money transfers to
several foreign bank accounts.</P>
      <P>The weekly cited anonymous sources saying that Wu had closed Taiwan bank
accounts belonging to her and her husband, as well as several others, in 2006,
soon after the exposure of the "state affairs fund" scandal. In that scandal,
Chen's wife and three close aides were charged with misuse of public funds.</P>
      <P>Chen himself was immune from charges while a sitting president, but prosecutors
launched a probe against him immediately after he stepped down from office on
May 20.</P>
      <P>Next Weekly claimed that the Taiwan accounts were created under the names of
Wu's son Chen Chih-chung and her daughter Chen Hsing-yu and were used for stock
trading.</P>
      <P>Shortly before Chen's news conference, Kuomintang Legislator Hung Hsiu-chu
alleged that Swiss prosecutors had asked Taiwan authorities to verify the origin
of a huge amount of funds in a Swiss bank account in the name of Chen's
daughter-in-law Huang Jui-ching.</P>
      <P>The Foreign Ministry later confirmed that the Swiss had requested Taiwan's
cooperation in an unspecified case.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, local cable news station TVBS reported that more than US$20 million
was deposited  in the Swiss account  in Chen's daughter-in-law 's name on Feb.
8, 2007.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Several Singaporean newspapers have recently reported that frozen ducks imported
from Taiwan are gaining popularity since they began being imported into the
city-state in April.</P>
      <P>The English-language Straits Times and the Chinese-language Lianhe Zaobao and
Shin Min Daily News said the ducks taste similar to the live ducks that
Singaporeans are accustomed to and that a lot of roast duck vendors have now
turned to frozen ducks from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>A 54-year-old roast duck shop owner told the Straits Times that frozen ducks
from Taiwan are cleaner and he does not have to spend a lot of time preparing
them.</P>
      <P>He also said the Taiwanese ducks are cheaper than live ducks from Malaysia.</P>
      <P>Another frozen meat importer told the Lianhe Zaobao that the recent world oil
price surge has added transportation costs, making live ducks from Malaysia more
expensive but presenting an opportunity for Taiwanese frozen ducks.</P>
      <P>Previously, the price of Taiwanese ducks from Hualien and Pingtung was higher
than live ducks from Malaysia, but is now between 8 percent and 10 percent
cheaper, giving them a competitive edge.</P>
      <P>Roast ducks are popular in Singapore and the country mainly relies on Malaysia
for supplies. Singapore imported 6.4 million live ducks, or 12,800 tons, from
Malaysia last year.</P>
      <P>In comparison, the ratio of imported frozen ducks is much smaller, with only 603
tons imported last year, 90 percent of which came from the United States, with
the rest coming from France and the Netherlands. However, one roast duck vendor
said the American ducks are too mushy for Singaporean tastes and that the
tougher Taiwanese ones are more to their liking.</P>
      <P>As inflation in Singapore has reached a 26-year high, the government is looking
for cheaper sources of high quality food, and approved imports of frozen duck
from Taiwan to ensure the diversification of food sources.</P>
      <P>Since Taiwanese imports began in April, the volume has reached 35 tons as of the
end of June.</P>

      <P>Cross-Taiwan Strait ties should move in a positive direction after the Beijing
Olympics amid high public expectations, Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng
said Thursday.</P>
      <P>"If Taiwan-China relations fail to improve after the Olympics, it will
disappoint many Taiwanese people who hope for an improved situation across the
strait, " Wang told reporters following a seminar sponsored by the Democratic
Pacific Union to mark its third anniversary.</P>
      <P>"There remains ample room for Taiwan and China to further enhance their
exchanges and cooperation, but if the two sides fail to achieve this aim, it
will mean that previous efforts by both will have been in vain, " he said.</P>
      <P>Thanks to the success of the Beijing Olympics, China will definitely emerge as a
regional and global superpower after the Olympics, despite several incidents
that have occurred so far and regardless  of the country's tainted human rights
record,  he predicted.</P>
      <P>With the greater leverage that will come with its stronger clout, China is set
to play a prominent role in critical international issues, he said.</P>
      <P>Although President Ma Ying-jeou has been seeking to improve Taiwan-China ties by
implementing a series of economic opening measures since he assumed office May
20, Wang pointed out that Taiwan- U.S. and Taiwan-Japan ties are equally
important.</P>
      <P>Wang visited the United States and Japan recently, respectively, to lobby for
continued support from the two countries for Taiwan in the international

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan said at a regular Thursday Cabinet meeting that before
the government can outline plans to build casinos on the outlying islands, it
will first have to decriminalize gambling on the islands.</P>
      <P>No decision was made on the controversial issue of construction of offshore
casinos, as Liu said only that "in principle, one of the major efforts in the
development of the outlying islands is the construction of the tourism
industry."</P>
      <P>Opening casinos on Taiwan's outlying islands -- especially the Penghu Islands --
to attract tourists has not been able to achieve consensus despite years of
discussion, mainly due to the fact that gambling is illegal.</P>
      <P>The Penghu Islands, located in the Taiwan Strait, are in a poor economic and
financial situation thanks to its lack of economic activity apart from fishing,
and tourism has become its lifeline.</P>
      <P>It has been suggested that the decriminalization of the Offshore Islands
Development Act would boost the economy by helping to introduce the gaming
industry to the islands, thereby attracting more visitors.</P>
      <P>Liu said the Cabinet will need to push for the decriminalization of gaming
before the casino plan can be outlined by the Council for Economic Planning and
Development (CEPD).</P>
      <P>Should the Legislature Yuan legalize the gaming industry on the outlying
islands, the Cabinet will then need to draft a statute to regulate gaming.</P>
      <P>While the present Cabinet bid is a long way from actually building the gaming
industry, Liu's statement nevertheless marked a step forward and suggests that
the casino plan might finally see the light after decades of debate.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou has shown his support for the casino plan, saying before
his May 20 inauguration that once Penghu residents reach consensus on the casino
issue, the central government will spare no efforts to help facilitate the
development.</P>

      <P>Marine biologists at Academia Sinica have spotted a new patch of algal reefs
along the coast of Shanyuan Bay in Taitung County, with a total surface area
estimated to be larger than any other algal reef in eastern Taiwan, sources at
the institution said Thursday.</P>
      <P>"It is quite a surprise to find so large a patch of algal reefs that is
relatively undisturbed by human activities, " said Chen Chao- lun, an associate
researcher at Academia Sinica's Research Center for Biodiversity.</P>
      <P>Algal reefs, formed by crystalline calcium carbonates left by dead calcareous
algae, usually grow at the extremely slow rate of 0.1 centimeters to 0.2
centimeters in thickness per year.</P>
      <P>The largest patch of algal reefs in Taiwan is located off the northern county of
Taoyuan and is four kilometers long and 500 meters wide.</P>
      <P>To date, the largest patch of algal reefs found in eastern Taiwan is located in
Kenting National Park's Chialoshui area. However, based on preliminary
estimates, the reefs in Shanyuan Bay could be bigger than those in Chialoshui,
said Chen.</P>
      <P>Chen -- who was commissioned in 2008 by the government to conduct a decade-long
survey of the marine ecology in Shanyuan Bay, Green Island, and the Penghu
Islets -- spotted new coral reefs and new coral species in Shanyuan Bay early
this year.</P>
      <P>Chen said that according to observations in the past, the sea water temperatures
are higher than normal in Shanyuan Bay, which would usually inhibit the
development of algae reefs. However, the new findings contradict this premise,
he said.</P>
      <P>"Since some areas of the algae reefs have already been damaged by discarded fish
nets, the government should step up its efforts to preserve the area and to
facilitate further research on algae reefs," Chen suggested.</P>

      <P>Local light emitting diode (LED) lights, which are generally believed to be
energy-conserving,  do not necessarily  save power  and are more expensive  than
average fluorescent ones, according to test results released Thursday by the
Consumers' Foundation.</P>
      <P>The foundation conducted the tests on 11 samples from local hypermarkets, home
retailers, chain bookstores, electronic product markets and the Internet in
June.</P>
      <P>The samples included four bulbs, three lamps and four USB lights, according to
the foundation.</P>
      <P>After conducting the tests, the foundation said in a statement that it
discovered that small wattages are enough to power LED lights, compared with the
dozens of watts needed for incandescent or fluorescent lights.</P>
      <P>However, under the same lighting demands, LED lights do not necessarily
outperform other types of lights,  the foundation observed, attributing this to
the LED lights' low luminous efficiency and power factor.</P>
      <P>As a result, it is better to use LED lights as purely decorative lights rather
than as reading lights, the foundation went on.</P>
      <P>In addition, the foundation said the prices of local LED lights are three or
four times higher than those of average fluorescent ones, and demanded a price
decrease.</P>
      <P>The foundation also pointed out that LED lights are new products and there are
currently no regulations governing the application of LED lights in home
products.</P>
      <P>It urged authorities to formulate regulations on LED products and to require
them to meet a certain level of energy conservation.</P>
      <P>When buying LED devices, consumers should turn them on for a period of time and
choose ones with lower temperatures,  the foundation suggested.</P>
      <P>LED devices are commonly used in traffic lights, store signs, billboards,
flashlights and vehicle lights.</P>
      <P>Taiwan started developing its LED industry in 1986 and has grown rapidly since
then, according to government statistics released a day earlier.</P>
      <P>From 2000, Taiwan's LED industry has had the world's highest production volume
and the world's second-largest  output,  the statistics show.</P>
      <P>In 2007, Taiwan's LED industry generated NT$53.9 billion (about US$1.7 billion)
in output, accounting for 25 percent of the world's total production value,
according to the statistics.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taipei Zoo to house two Chinese pandas</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>) The Council of Agriculture (COA) approved Thursday an application by the
Taipei City Zoo to house a pair of giant pandas offered by China, making the zoo
the first in Taiwan to possess the rare animal.</P>
      <P>The COA made the decision after on-site inspections earlier in the day of the
two zoos that filed applications to house the pandas -- the Taipei Zoo and the
Leofoo Safari Zoo located in Hsinchu County, northern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The Taipei Zoo was picked over Leofoo as it provides better conditions in the
areas of education, research plans and medical care, said COA representatives at
a press conference after the review meeting.</P>
      <P>"Taipei has prepared for many years to receive the pandas; we will consider them
as our own children and provide them with the best care, " Taipei Mayor Hau
Lung-bin was quoted as saying by Taipei city government spokesman Yang Hsiao-
tung.</P>
      <P>According to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild
Fauna and Flora (CITES), the Taipei Zoo should apply first for authorization
from the Bureau of Foreign Trade under the Ministry of Economic Affairs.</P>
      <P>Due to the import procedures and quarantine measures, the two pandas might not
arrive in Taiwan before the end of the year, according to the Taipei city
government.</P>
      <P>The two pandas, named Tuan-tuan and Yuan-yuan by the Chinese, which means
"reunion," were offered as a gift to Taiwan after a visit to China by then-
Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan in 2005.</P>
      <P>The offer, however, was rejected by the COA under the previous Democratic
Progressive Party administration as Taiwan did not have adequate conditions to
raise the animals.</P>
      <P>According to a survey conducted in July by the Research, Development and
Evaluation Commission under the Executive Yuan, 56.1 percent of the Taiwanese
are in favor of receiving the Chinese pandas, and 60.1 percent believe the
pandas will help Taiwan's tourism.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taipei-Kaohsiung flights to continue until late September</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  14  (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Domestic flights between Taipei and Kaohsiung will be maintained for another
month, despite a request from Mandarin Airlines to halt the service, Civil
Aeronautics Administration (CAA) Director-General Lee Lung-wen said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The CAA has asked Mandarin Airlines to provide the service for at least one more
month until the end of September because air travel demand from residents in the
southern Kaohsiung and Pingtung regions remains high, Lee said, adding that
"this is why the CAA has not approved the carrier's request to halt the
service."</P>
      <P>"Taipei-Kaohsiung flights will be maintained through September, " Lee stated.</P>
      <P>The passenger load factor on the Taipei-Kaohsiung route still averages around 50
percent, he noted. Meanwhile, Mandarin Airlines, the sole operator on the route,
announced that from Aug. 16, it will offer only a single daily round-trip flight
between the two largest cities in Taiwan, down from the present seven round-trip
flights per week.</P>
      <P>The number of flights on the Taipei-Kaohsiung route exceeded 100 per day during
its peak years, when it was the most profitable domestic flight.</P>
      <P>Although the CAA did not approve Mandarin Airlines' request last week to halt
the flight service, a company executive said a passenger load factor lower than
60 percent makes it very difficult for a carrier to maintain operations.</P>
      <P>Air travel on the western Taiwan corridor has been hard-hit by the high speed
train system that went into service in January 2007.</P>
      <P>In the face of operating difficulties from the fierce competition from the
bullet train, aviation companies have progressively chopped flights between
Taipei and Taichung in central Taiwan and between Taipei, Chiayi and Tainan in
the south.</P>
      <P>In 1997, passengers took 18 million flights inside Taiwan, but the figure
decreased to 8 million in 2006 and to 4 million in 2007, according to
statistics.</P>
      <P>Industry sources predicted that the number will drop even further this year.</P>
      <P>In another development, UNI Airways Corp., which flies from Taipei to Pingtung
and Hengchung in southern Taiwan, is also considering stopping its flights on
the two routes.</P>
      <P>But Lee said the CAA will not allow UNI Airways to stop flying the two routes,
out of fear that the two local airports might be forced to close as a result.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, the CAA will allocate preferential cross-Taiwan Strait and
international flights to aviation companies that cooperate with the government
in serving money-losing destinations at home.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) confirmed Thursday that its
representative  in Switzerland had received a request from the Swiss
Confederation's Department of Justice three weeks ago, seeking assistance about
suspected money laundering by the daughter-in-law of former President Chen Shui-
bian.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for the ministry said that the request had been transferred to the
Ministry of Justice (MOJ).</P>
      <P>The MOJ also confirmed in a news release late Thursday that it had received the
request from the MOFA through the Prosecutors Office of the Taiwan High Court
and that the request had been relayed to the Taipei District Court's Public
Prosecutors Office.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, Chen had apologized to the nation, admitting that he lied
about the election campaign expenses for his two mayoral elections and two
presidential elections between 1993 and 2004.</P>
      <P>Accompanied by his lawyer, Richard Lee, Chen told a press conference that he was
unaware that his wife, Wu Shu-jen, had wired surplus funds from election
campaign contributions abroad until early this year.</P>
      <P>He said his conscience dictated to him that he could not continue to cheat
himself and others, and that he had decided to make a clean breast.</P>
      <P>"I did something that I should not have done," Chen admitted, adding that he was
"willing to accept criticism and face an investigation."</P>
      <P>Chen made the confession after Hung Hsiu-chu, a legislator of the ruling
Kuomintang, revealed copies of documents showing that the Federal Department of
Justice and Police of the Swiss Confederation was requesting assistance from the
government in Taipei about suspected money laundering  by Chen's son Chen Chih-
chung and daughter-in-law Huang Jui-ching through two Swiss bank accounts.</P>
      <P>The former president claimed that he did not touch any funds from the campaign
contributions and that all the surplus funds were handled by his wife.</P>
      <P>He admitted that the surplus did not belong to him and that it was intended for
use to help Democratic Progressive Party candidates in future elections.</P>
      <P>A day earlier, Chen had denied through his lawyer a claim by Next magazine that
his daughter-in-law had laundered money for him by secretly wiring NT$300
million (US$9.63 million) into an overseas account.</P>
      <P>Next magazine claimed that prosecutors learned from the Egmont Group,  an
international  association of financial intelligence organizations, that Chen
had used Huang and other members of her family to wire the NT$300 million out of
Taiwan, and that the total could exceed NT$1 billion if other "suspicious"
capital is accounted for.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Presidential Office spokesman Wang Yu-chi said Thursday in Paraguay that
President Ma Ying-jeou had not commented on the latest scandal to beset his
predecessor, Chen Shui-bian, in which Chen's wife is alleged to have been
involved in wiring campaign funds into overseas bank accounts.</P>
      <P>"So far, we have no comment on the incident, " Wang told reporters.</P>
      <P>Ma, who is making his first state visit since taking office May 20, is in
Paraguay to attend the Aug. 15 inauguration of Paraguayan President-elect
Fernando Lugo.</P>
      <P>He was scheduled to hold a news conference at 5: 30 p.m. local time, in which he
was expected to be swamped with questions about the scandal.</P>
      <P>Chen admitted Thursday said that his wife Wu Shu-jen had wired abroad un
unspecified amount of cash that Chen had received as campaign contributions for
his two Taipei mayoral elections and two presidential election campaigns.</P>
      <P>In a televised news conference, Chen apologized to the public for not clearly
accounting for his campaign contributions, admitting that the failure to make
such a report was "something that is not permitted by the law."</P>
      <P>The former president insisted his wife had made the wire transfers without his
knowledge, in case Chen needed the cash after he stepped down from the
presidency.</P>
      <P>Chen, who said the funds wired abroad were left over from his campaigns, argued
that at the time he received the campaign donations there was no law requiring
that he should report them.</P>
      <P>Under Taiwan's campaign laws, candidates are required to report campaign
spending but were not required to report all political donations until the
passage of the Political Contributions Act in 2004.</P>
      <P>The announcement was made one day after the Next Weekly tabloid reported  that
the Egmont Group,  an international  anti-money laundering network, had alerted
Taiwanese authorities that the former first lady had made large money transfers
to several foreign bank accounts.</P>
      <P>Shortly  before  Chen's news conference,  ruling Kuomintang Legislator Hung
Hsiu-chu said Swiss prosecutors had asked the Taiwanese authorities to verify
the origin of a huge amount of funds in a Swiss bank account in the name of
Chen's daughter-in-law, Huang Jui-ching.</P>
      <P>Local news station TVBS reported that more than US$20 million was deposited in
the Swiss account in Huang's name Feb. 8, 2007.</P>
      <P>The Foreign Ministry later confirmed that the Swiss authorities had indeed
requested Taiwan's cooperation in an unspecified case.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeous effort in seeking peace with China was well received by
outgoing Paraguayan President Nicanor Duarte Thursday during a bilateral meeting
in which Duarte expressed gratitude offered by Taiwan during his five-year
presidency.</P>
      <P>I would like to express my appreciation toward President Mas efforts in seeking
peace (with China) , Duarte was quoted as saying by Presidential Office
spokesman Wang Yu-chi, who briefed the reporters after the two heads of state
held a 45-minute meeting.</P>
      <P>Describing the atmosphere of the meeting as harmonious, Wang said Ma elaborated
his ideas of adiplomatic trucewith China and said that such approach was well-
received by many people.</P>
      <P>Under the precondition of diplomatic truce, we will strengthen relations with
Paraguay and consolidate our friendship, Ma said, adding that the method has
been well received in many Asian countries, as it is viewed as beneficiary in
promoting regional peace.</P>
      <P>The president said that a series of policies, such as the launch of direct
weekend charter flights across the Taiwan Strait, are aimed to normalize the
economic interactions  and promote peace and prosperity between the two sides.</P>
      <P>Cross-strait atmosphere already began changing with both Taipei and Beijing feel
that such approach serves the interests of the two," Ma was quoted as having
told Duarte.</P>
      <P>According to Wang, Ma and Duarte also shared experiences in land reform and
exchanged views on anti-drugs.</P>
      <P>Ma, who arrived at Paraguay around midnight on Wednesday to attend the
inauguration of Paraguayan President-elect Fernando Lugo on Aug. 15, expressed
best regards to the outgoing Duarte.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and Paraguay share a long friendship for 51 years and such friendship is
very rare, Ma said.I will remember the friendship that President Duarte had
offered to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In response, Duarte said that he is deeply grateful for the help offered by
Taiwan during his five-year presidency.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and Paraguay forged diplomatic relations in 1957 and Paraguay remains
Taiwans only ally in South America.</P>
      <P>Mas visit was viewed to strengthen ties with Paraguay given the fact that Lugo
had said many times that he would like to switch diplomatic recognition  to
China --  a statement that spurred speculations that Taiwan might lose Paraguay.</P>
      <P>However, Lugo told the Asuncion-based ABC Color daily news Tuesday that his
government will maintain ties with Taipei, a message that was welcomed by
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>After attending the inaugurations of Lugo, Ma is scheduled to go to the
Dominican Republic to attend the inauguration of President Leonel Fernandez for
a new term on Aug. 16. He will return to Taiwan on Aug. 19.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou's effort in seeking peace with China was well received by
outgoing Paraguayan President Nicanor Duarte Thursday during a bilateral meeting
in which Duarte expressed gratitude offered by Taiwan during his five-year
presidency.</P>
      <P>"I would like to express my appreciation toward President Ma's efforts in
seeking peace (with China) , "Duarte was quoted as saying by Presidential Office
spokesman Wang Yu-chi, who briefed the reporters after the two heads of state
held a 45-minute meeting.</P>
      <P>Describing the atmosphere of the meeting as harmonious, Wang said Ma elaborated
his ideas of a"diplomatic truce"with China and said that such approach was well-
received by many people.</P>
      <P>"Under the precondition of diplomatic truce, we will strengthen relations with
Paraguay and consolidate our friendship, "Ma said, adding that the method has
been well received in many Asian countries, as it is viewed as beneficiary in
promoting regional peace.</P>
      <P>The president said that a series of policies, such as the launch of direct
weekend charter flights across the Taiwan Strait, are aimed to normalize the
economic interactions  and promote peace and prosperity between the two sides.</P>
      <P>"Cross-strait atmosphere already began changing with both Taipei and Beijing
feel that such approach serves the interests of the two," Ma was quoted as
having told Duarte.</P>
      <P>According to Wang, Ma and Duarte also shared experiences in land reform and
exchanged views on anti-drugs.</P>
      <P>Ma, who arrived at Paraguay around midnight on Wednesday to attend the
inauguration of Paraguayan President-elect Fernando Lugo on Aug. 15, expressed
best regards to the outgoing Duarte.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan and Paraguay share a long friendship for 51 years and such friendship is
very rare, "Ma said."I will remember the friendship that President Duarte had
offered to Taiwan."</P>
      <P>In response, Duarte said that he is deeply grateful for the help offered by
Taiwan during his five-year presidency.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and Paraguay forged diplomatic relations in 1957 and Paraguay remains
Taiwan's only ally in South America.</P>
      <P>Ma's visit was viewed to strengthen ties with Paraguay given the fact that Lugo
had said many times that he would like to switch diplomatic recognition  to
China --  a statement that spurred speculations that Taiwan might lose Paraguay.</P>
      <P>However, Lugo told the Asuncion-based ABC Color daily news Tuesday that his
government will maintain ties with Taipei, a message that was welcomed by
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>After attending the inaugurations of Lugo, Ma is scheduled to go to the
Dominican Republic to attend the inauguration of President Leonel Fernandez for
a new term on Aug. 16. He will return to Taiwan on Aug. 19.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Chinese pandas expected to arrive in Taiwan at year-end</HEADLINE>

      <P>A pair of pandas offered by China are expected to arrive in Taiwan aboard a
charter plane at the end of the year, Taipei Zoo Director Jason Yeh said Friday.</P>
      <P>"Although the public is looking forward to an early arrival of the pandas, we
think it would be best for the shipment to take place at the end of the year
when the climate is more stable," Yeh said.</P>
      <P>Yeh explained that abrupt changes of temperature are typical of the climate in
October and November, making the shipment unsuitable.</P>
      <P>However, the situation will improve in the winter, which will help reduce the
possible negative impact from the movement on the health of the pandas, Yeh
said.</P>
      <P>He said the zoo is currently discussing with airline companies the issue of
chartering a plane to ship the pandas and is consulting with the Chinese
authorities on the proper delivery procedures, such as whether it is necessary
to maintain a constant temperature and assign a keeper to escort the animals.</P>
      <P>Yeh made the remarks one day after the zoo obtained Council of Agriculture (COA)
approval to house the pandas, beating the Leofoo Safari Zoo in Hsinchu County,
which was also competing to take charge of the animals.</P>
      <P>The two pandas, named Tuan-tuan and Yuan-yuan by the Chinese, which means
"reunion," were offered as a gift to Taiwan after a visit to China by then-
Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan in 2005.</P>
      <P>The offer, however, was rejected by the COA under the previous Democratic
Progressive Party administration on the grounds that Taiwan did not have
adequate conditions to raise the animals.</P>
      <P>According to a survey conducted in July by the Research, Development and
Evaluation Commission under the Executive Yuan, 56.1 percent of the Taiwanese
are in favor of receiving the Chinese pandas, and 60.1 percent believe the
pandas will help Taiwan's tourism.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Thursday during a state visit to attend the
inauguration of Paraguayan President-elect Fernando Lugo that relations between
Taiwan and Paraguay are very solid and that he is investing great confidence in
bilateral relations.</P>
      <P>"I'm very optimistic about diplomatic ties between Taiwan and Paraguay, " Ma
said at a news conference. "I believe bilateral relations are very solid and
that they will continue," he added.</P>
      <P>Lugo has said many times that he wants to establish full diplomatic relations
with China,  statements that have spurred speculation that Taiwan might lose its
only diplomatic ally in South America.</P>
      <P>Lugo, however, told the Asuncion-based ABC Color daily news Tuesday that his
government will maintain ties with Taipei -- a message that was welcomed by
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>During a meeting with Ma earlier in the day, he vowed to "improve and
consolidate relations with Taiwan," a statement that Presidential Office
spokesman Wang Yu-chi said "dissolves a lot of doubts on Taiwan-Paraguay ties."</P>
      <P>Asked about foreign aid to Paraguay, Ma said he did not bring any new
cooperation projects to discuss with Lugo, but added that Taiwan will evaluate
the possibility of instigating new ones, as long as "the proposals have
legitimate objectives and the granting procedures are in accordance with the
law."</P>
      <P>Noting that offering foreign aid to help allies is in line with international
trends and expectations, Ma said that as long as Taiwan sticks to this
principle, it can reverse its image of conducting so-called "checkbook
diplomacy" -- which he said is a result of the "vicious diplomatic competition"
between Taipei and Beijing.</P>
      <P>Ma proposed a "diplomatic truce" aimed at terminating the longstanding
diplomatic tug-of-war with China in which both countries try to lure each
other's allies to switch diplomatic allegiance by offering large sums of money
in foreign aid to developing countries.</P>
      <P>He also touted the strategy of "modus vivendi" or "pragmatic diplomacy," aimed
at leveraging more international space for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Ma said that if the policy of seeking a diplomatic truce with China succeeds, it
is possible that the number of allies will remain at 23, without Taiwan losing
any more allies.</P>
      <P>"Although such a result might not be agreed upon by everyone, the point is what
serves the best the national interests," Ma added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan's U.N. bid will be `very careful': president</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Asuncion,  Aug. 14 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Thursday in Paraguay that Taiwan's bid for
membership in the United Nations this year will be "very cautious and careful, "
as Taiwan has to take the reality of the international political situation into
consideration.</P>
      <P>"We will be very wary of this year's U.N. bid, given the fact that both
referendums regarding the issue failed to pass in the March presidential
election, " Ma said in his first news conference of his first state visit to
South America and the Caribbean.</P>
      <P>"No matter what the bid might be, it should be achievable and should uphold
Taiwan's dignity, " the president said. "We will take this into consideration
and then make a proposal that not only will achieve our goals but also will not
affect other diplomatic interests or the interests of cross-Taiwan Strait
relations," he added.</P>
      <P>The controversial referendums,  proposed by the then-ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) and opposition Kuomintang (KMT) , asked voters if they
supported "joining the U.N. under the name Taiwan" or "returning to the U.N.
under the name Republic of China, " respectively.</P>
      <P>The DPP version brought severe criticism from Western countries such as the
United States and the European Union, which said it was "provocative and
unnecessary."</P>
      <P>Ma said the result reflected the fact that the Taiwanese have strong will to
participate in the U.N. and that the previous methods of the bid were not
accepted by the general public.</P>
      <P>He said the government will adopt a different strategy this year, taking  into
consideration  the will  of the people  and the international reality, and will
submit its bid within the next few days.</P>
      <P>The 63rd regular session of the U.N. General Assembly is slated to be held in
mid-September at U.N. Headquarters in New York.</P>
      <P>The ROC has tried without success to re-enter the U.N. since 1993, after losing
its seat to the People's Republic of China in 1971.</P>
      <P>Last year marked the first time it had changed tactics by bidding to join the
world body under the name Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Asked if he will try to promote the U.N. bid at the inaugurations of Paraguayan
President-elect Fernando Lugo and Dominican Republic President Leonel Fernandez,
when he will be joined by heads of state from Taiwan's allies and other
countries, Ma said Taiwan's allies all support the efforts the country regarding
the issue and do not care much about the method used.</P>
      <P>Speaking of Taiwan's international space, Ma said the government will continue
its bid to participate in the World Health Assembly, as it is one of the
international organizations in which Taiwan's efforts have made significant
progress, but will also try to join other international bodies.</P>
      <P>Ma has said many times that he would like to have a "diplomatic truce" with
China, a strategy that he said means both Taipei and Beijing will stop their
meaningless diplomatic tug-of-war in which each side tries to lure each other's
allies by offering large sums of money in foreign aid.</P>
      <P>He also proposed the "modus vivendi" approach for seeking more international
space along with China in the global arena.</P>
      <P>"A diplomatic truce does not only apply to bilateral relations but also to
multilateral relations, " he said, adding that the fact that experts from both
Taiwan and China were elected simultaneously into an influential World Trade
Organization (WTO) group last month serves as a very good example of a win-win
situation.</P>
      <P>"Just as I said in my inauguration speech, Taiwan and China should help each
other with respect, " Ma said. "I hope such an example can also happen in other
international organizations, " he added.</P>
      <P>The WTO announced last month that the Committee on Subsidies and Countervailing
Measures elected four members of the Permanent Group of Exports, including Lo
Chang-fa, a well-known scholar in international trade law in Taiwan and China's
Zhang Yuqing.</P>

      <P>Taiwan and China have resumed cooperation on oil exploration off southern Taiwan
after a year-long hiatus, sources from Taiwan's state-run oil company said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>The resumption  marked  a new development  in the thawing cross-Taiwan Strait
relations since the Kuomintang (KMT) , which favors  closer ties with China,
took power May 20 from the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>Taiwan opened to direct weekend charter flights and more tourists from China
July 4.</P>
      <P>It will also receive a pair of giant pandas with Chinese names suggesting
reunion between the two sides by the end of this year.</P>
      <P>China claims sovereignty over self-ruled Taiwan and vows war if it moves toward
formal independence.</P>
      <P>CPC Corp., Taiwan and China National Offshore Oil Corp. (CNOOC), one of the
largest state-owned oil giants in China, recently continued a contract for an
oil exploration project off southern Taiwan for an additional two years, the
sources said.</P>
      <P>CPC Corp., Taiwan has also obtained approval from the government for another new
oil exploration project off northern Taiwan with the Chinese oil company, the
sources said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's previous cooperation project with China to explore for oil off southern
Taiwan came to a halt after the former DPP administration included "Taiwan" in
Taiwan's oil company's name both in Chinese and English, according to the
sources.</P>
      <P>At the time, the DPP argued that the name change was aimed at preventing
Taiwan's oil company from being mistaken for a Chinese company.</P>
      <P>Critics,  however, blasted the name change as highlighting Taiwanese identity to
push for formal independence.</P>
      <P>The Taipei-based oil company changed its English name from Chinese Petroleum
Corporation (CPC) to CPC Corp., Taiwan, in February 2007.</P>

      <P>Taiwan renewed its bid to enter the United Nations Thursday by submitting a
proposal to the U.N. Secretariat calling for the U. N. to reconsider the
feasibility of meaningful participation in the world organization by Taiwan.</P>
      <P>A proposal emphasizing the importance of Taiwan's "meaningful participation" in
the U.N. and a cross-Taiwan Strait policy of "reconciliation and truce" was
submitted to the U.N. Secretariat by representatives of St. Vincent and the
Solomon Islands, two of the Republic of China's diplomatic allies.</P>
      <P>It marks a fresh approach by the ROC government in pushing for U.N.  admission
for Taiwan since President Ma Ying-jeou  was inaugurated May 20. The proposal
does not mention the country's attempt to enter the U.N. under the name Taiwan,
nor does it mention the ROC seeking to return to the U.N.</P>
      <P>The previous Democratic Progressive Party administration for the first time in
2007 applied to join the U.N. as a full member under the name Taiwan. That
proposal did not make the agenda of the U.N. General Assembly.</P>
      <P>Since 1993, Taiwan's supporters have been trying to get the General Assembly to
list the issue of its admission on the U.N. agenda, but Beijing's argument that
Taiwan is part of China has prevailed.</P>
      <P>Since Ma's inauguration, cross-strait relations have seen a thaw.</P>
      <P>This year, 17 of Taiwan's diplomatic allies have endorsed the new proposal on
principles of "dignity, pragmatism and flexibility, " according to a Ministry of
Foreign Affairs official posted in New York.</P>
      <P>"This year, our new proposal aims at not competing with China over the issue of
representation, but at meeting Taiwan's desire to join  the international
community  and take  part in related activities," the official said.</P>
      <P>Friday is the last day for U.N. members to submit proposals to make up the
agenda of the General Assembly, which is scheduled to begin Sept. 16.</P>
      <P>This year, three of Taiwan's diplomatic allies -- Nicaragua, Solomon Islands and
Honduras -- entered the U.N. General Committee as members, the highest number of
Taiwanese allies since 1993. The General Committee, made up of delegates from 28
nations, will make the decisions pertaining to the agenda of the next General
Assembly.</P>

      <P>A congressman and envoy of Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper attending the
inauguration of Paraguayan President-elect Fernando Lugo Aug. 15 said Thursday
after a meeting with President Ma Ying-jeou that he is encouraged by the thawing
relations between Taiwan and China, which he said are moving in a very positive
direction.</P>
      <P>"I think that anyone, any thoughtful person in the world, would be encouraged
with the dialogue, " Jim Abbott told CNA. "I think things are moving very
positively."</P>
      <P>He was referring to the fact that bilateral relations between Taipei and Beijing
have improved significantly since Ma took office May 20 with the reopening of
negotiations between the two sides, the launch of weekend direct cross-strait
charter flights and the opening of Taiwan to more Chinese tourists.</P>
      <P>Ties between China and Taiwan were frozen during former President Chen Shui-
bian's eight years in office due to his pro-independence stance.</P>
      <P>China views Taiwan as a renegade province and continuously suppresses Taiwan's
international space by blocking its efforts to join international organizations
and protesting its use of the title Republic of China or Taiwan to join any
international entities.</P>
      <P>Ma proposed a "diplomatic truce" in order to end the longstanding diplomatic
tug-of-war with China in which both countries try to lure each other's allies to
switch diplomatic allegiance by offering large sums of money in foreign aid to
developing countries.</P>
      <P>He also touts the strategy of "modus vivendi" or "pragmatic diplomacy" that aims
to obtain more international space for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>As chairman of the Canada-Taiwan Parliamentary Friendship Group, Abbott
described his meeting with Ma as a great opportunity to get together and get to
know Ma personally, although they did not discuss Ma's diplomatic approaches in
detail.</P>
      <P>"I was asking primarily about the very positive things that are happening
related to the cross-strait issues. It was more of a very personal getting
acquainted situation," he said.</P>
      <P>Ma left Taiwan Aug. 12 for his first state visit since he took office  May  20
to attend  the  inaugurations  of Paraguayan President-elect Fernando Lugo and
Dominican Republic President Leonel Fernandez. He will return to Taiwan Aug. 19.</P>

Friendship Group, co-chair of the Canada-Mongolia Inter-Parliamentary
Association and Treasurer of the Canada ASEAN Inter-Parliamentary Association.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taxi drivers earn NT$21,305 per month average: MOTC survey</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Despite their long work hours, taxi drivers earned an average of just NT$21,305
(US$680.7) per month in 2007, according to the results of a survey released
Friday by the Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC).</P>
      <P>The figure marked a decrease of NT$1,698 from the amount recorded in a similar
survey conducted in 2005, an MOTC official said, adding that the drop in
earnings was mainly related to steep hikes in fuel prices over the past few
years.</P>
      <P>The ministry conducted the mail survey between February and April this year and
collected 6,923 valid samples for a return rate of 48.6 percent. The survey had
a confidence level of 95 percent, with a margin of error of 1 percent.</P>
      <P>The results show that local cab drivers worked an average of 10.2 hours per day
after deducting rest and meal times and that their cars were left empty for an
average of 3.6 hours during their working hours.</P>
      <P>According to the poll results, taxi drivers' average monthly earnings were
lowest in eastern Taiwan, at NT$11,844, and highest in the north, at NT$23,975.</P>
      <P>Amid continued increases in fuel costs, 12 counties and cities have raised taxi
fares over the past year. However, 74.6 percent of the respondents said fare
adjustments have led to a decline in the number of passenger rides and 61.3
percent said their revenues slid after the fare hikes.</P>
      <P>The survey further found that fewer than 20 percent of the respondents pick up
passengers via radio dispatch or GPS coordinates and that more than 70 percent
still rely on traditional street cruising to get passengers. According to the
survey, those who have installed radio or satellite communications systems in
their cars earn NT$386 per day more than those who have not.</P>
      <P>If a driver works 27 days per month, installation of a radio or satellite
dispatch system will generate NT$10,422 in additional revenues per month. After
deducting the monthly dispatch cost of NT$2,400, the driver can still secure an
increase of NT$8,000, representing a 37.5 percent rise in his or her monthly
earnings.</P>
      <P>Chi Wen-chung, director of the MOTC's Department of Railways and Highways, said
it is worth studying why cab drivers are unwilling to join the radio dispatch
system, even though the service can bring them more income.</P>
      <P>While the MOTC is planning to set up more taxi ranks to help lower the empty cab
rates, the survey found that a majority of 73.7 percent of the respondents were
dissatisfied with the quality of the existing taxi ranks.</P>
      <P>Major reasons cited by the detractors included the fact that existing taxi ranks
are often dominated by underworld rings or lack enough parking spaces, while the
number of taxi ranks remains too few to attract passengers, according to the
survey.</P>

    <HEADLINE>5 shuttle bus lines planned for Kaohsiung MRT's new orange line</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,   Aug.  15  (CNA)
08/15/08  13:53:31
(By Steve Bercic)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Kaohsiung city government's Transportation Bureau said Friday that five
shuttle bus lines are planned to serve passengers using the orange line of the
Mass Rapid Transit system that is set to open before the Mid-Autumn Festival,
which falls on Sept. 14 this year.</P>
      <P>Buses on the five lines will be operated by the city government's Kaohsiung City
Bus Service Administration,  unlike shuttle bus services on the red line, which
are operated by private bus companies, the bureau said.</P>
      <P>Chang Shu-chuan, a section head at the Transportation Bureau, said that the
bureau invited bids in March and May of this year for private bus companies to
operate the orange line shuttle bus services, but no companies responded.</P>
      <P>The city government's offer of NT$700,000 (US$22,330) per bus in subsidies as
well as fuel subsidies of NT$40 per kilometer for the first one or two years of
operations failed to attract any bidders.</P>
      <P>The bureau therefore commissioned the Kaohsiung City Bus Service Administration
to run the orange line shuttle bus services, according to Chang.</P>
      <P>Noting that bureau surveys show that 82 percent of Kaohsiung residents support
the shuttle bus services offered for the red line, Chang said that the bureau
decided to provide the same services on the orange line.</P>
      <P>Although there are 20 shuttle bus lines serving the red line at present, only
five are currently planned for the orange line.</P>
      <P>Chang said that this is due to the fact that the orange line is only half the
length of the red line and has only eight stations within Kaohsiung City.</P>
      <P>Shuttle buses on the five lines feeding the orange line will run every 15
minutes during rush hour and every 20 minutes during off-peak hours, she noted.</P>
      <P>As for concerns that having the Kaohsiung City Bus Service Administration
provide the shuttle bus service might draw buses away from the city's regular
bus routes and reduce the quality of service, Chang said the Transportation
Bureau has mapped out thorough plans and that the quality of service on regular
public bus lines will be maintained.</P>
      <P>She added that the administration will be able to receive fuel subsidies of
NT$40 per kilometer from the municipal government's air pollution fund for
providing the shuttle bus service.</P>

Thursday in Tainan City, southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to a spokesman for National Cheng Kung University in Tainan City,
which organized the activity, the five-day "Nightmarket Workshop" encourages
participants to create collections of life experience  through a series of
inspiring activities  such as brainstorming, concept visualization and
experiments.</P>
      <P>The lab, part of MIT's School of Architecture and Planning, consists of faculty
members and students of inter-disciplinary research projects ranging from
psychology, music, graphic design and multimedia to technology, the spokesman
said.</P>
      <P>The lab cradles the world's outstanding designers and inventors, and recruits
talented members every year, according to the spokesman.</P>
      <P>The 150 participants -- college and graduate students -- will also visit

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taipei District Prosecutors Office has started an investigation into
suspected money laundering by the former first family, based on information
provided by the Swiss authorities, a spokesman said Friday.</P>
      <P>The case was assigned to head prosecutor Ching Chi-jen as soon as the office
received a request by the Swiss Confederation's Department of Justice  seeking
Taiwan's  assistance  in probing  possible money-laundering in Switzerland by
former President Chen Shui-bian's son Chen Chih-chung and daughter-in-law Huang
Jui-ching, according to Prosecutor Lin Chin-tsun.</P>
      <P>Lin said the office will do its utmost to cooperate with the Swiss authorities
and will deal with the matter according to the law.</P>
      <P>Ching departed Taiwan for Switzerland three days ago and is expected to review
the deposits and withdrawals of accounts created under the name of Huang Jui-
ching at Merrill Lynch Bank, sources said.</P>
      <P>Also Friday, Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) spokesman Henry Chen admitted
that there was "administrative negligence" on the part of the representative
office in Switzerland for delaying the delivery to Taipei of a letter from the
Swiss Confederation's Department of Justice, in which the request for assistance
was put forth.</P>
      <P>The letter, dated June 16, was received by the representative office in early
July, but staffers there sat on it for nearly a month before forwarding it in
late July to the MOFA,  which later transferred it to the Ministry of Justice
(MOJ).</P>
      <P>On Thursday, the MOJ confirmed for the first time that it had received the
request through the MOFA, in the wake of a revelation by ruling Kuomintang
Legislator Hung Hsiu-chu.</P>
      <P>Hung's revelation also prompted Chen Shui-bian to call a news conference that
same day in which he admitted that his wife Wu Shu-jen had wired abroad an
unspecified amount of money that he had received as campaign contributions.</P>
      <P>Chen confessed that he lied about the election campaign expenses for his two
mayoral elections and two presidential elections between 1993 and 2004 but
claimed he was unaware that the surplus funds were wired abroad by his wife
until early this year.</P>
      <P>Chen rejected Hung's allegation that the funds wired overseas could be connected
to his "state affairs funds" embezzlement case and a recent scandal involving a
botched attempt to win Papua New Guinea as a diplomatic ally.</P>
      <P>A day earlier, Chen denied through his lawyer a claim by Next magazine that his
daughter-in-law had laundered money for him by secretly wiring NT$300 million
overseas.</P>
      <P>The weekly tabloid said that soon after the exposure of the "state affairs fund"
case in 2006, the former first lady closed bank accounts belonging to herself
and her husband, as well as several others created under the names of her son
Chen Chih-chung and her daughter Chen Hsing-yu, which were used for stock
trading.</P>
      <P>Wu then remitted NT$300 million overseas through various bank accounts belonging
to her daughter-in-law and other members of her family, according to the
magazine.</P>
      <P>Wu was charged with corruption and forgery in November 2006 for using receipts
provided by others to claim reimbursements totaling NT$14.8 million from the
president's "state affairs fund" between July 2002 and March 2006.</P>
      <P>She has seldom been willing to appear in court to answer the charges, claiming
"ill health."</P>
      <P>Chen, who had immunity from prosecution while in office, was named as a co-
defendant in the "state affairs fund" case as soon as he stepped down from the
presidency May 20.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Thursday in Paraguay that the judiciary will
determine whether former President Chen Shui-bian committed the crime of money
laundering after he admitted that his wife funneled campaign funds into overseas
bank accounts.</P>
      <P>"If it is money laundering, it is a criminal case, " Ma said in a news
conference. "The truth should be determined by the judiciary rather than by the
persons involved," he added.</P>
      <P>According to Man, it will require further investigation to clarify the case and
any statements made by the suspects are "only personal opinions."</P>
      <P>"The key should be: what is the truth? Where did the money come from and where
did it go?" said Ma.</P>
      <P>Chen admitted a day earlier that his wife Wu Shu-jen had wired overseas an
unspecified amount of money that Chen had received as campaign contributions for
his two Taipei mayoral elections and two presidential election campaigns.</P>
      <P>In a televised news conference, Chen apologized to the public for not clearly
accounting for his campaign contributions, admitting that the failure to make
such a report was "something that is not permitted by the law."</P>
      <P>The former president insisted his wife made the wire transfers without his
knowledge.</P>
      <P>Under Taiwan's campaign laws, candidates are required to report campaign
spending, but were not required to report all political donations until the
passage of the Political Contributions Act in 2004.</P>
      <P>The announcement was made one day after the Next Weekly tabloid reported  that
the Egmont Group,  an international  anti-money laundering network, had alerted
the Taiwanese authorities that the former first lady had made large money
transfers to several foreign bank accounts.</P>
      <P>Shortly before Cheng's news conference, Kuomintang Legislator Hung Hsiu-chu said
Swiss prosecutors  had asked the Taiwanese authorities to verify the origin of a
huge amount of funds in Swiss bank accounts under the name of Chen's daughter-
in-law, Huang Jui-ching.</P>
      <P>Local news station TVBS reported that more than US$20 million was deposited in
the Swiss accounts in Huang's name Feb. 8, 2007.</P>
      <P>The Foreign Ministry later confirmed that the Swiss had indeed requested
Taiwan's cooperation in an unspecified case.</P>
      <P>Asked about Chen's accusation that Ma also failed to fully report campaign
funds, the president replied that "I always fully report all my campaign funds."</P>
      <P>"It is unknown whether the case is really linked to election campaigns, " Ma
went on, adding that Chen appeared to be making it seem that way on purpose.</P>
      <P>Ma, who is making his first state visit since taking office May 20, is in
Paraguay to attend the Aug. 15 inauguration of Paraguayan President-elect

festival celebrated on the seventh lunar month in which the gates of hell are
said to open, allowing ghosts to mingle with the living.</P>
      <P>Hau made the call when he addressed a worship ritual that took place at the
Taipei Flower Auction Co. to mark Ghost Festival, the 15th day of the month,
which fell on that day.</P>
      <P>At the ritual, the Taipei Flower Auction Co. for the first time offered freshly
cut flowers instead of burning incense and paper "ghost paper" to appease the
spirits and wandering souls.</P>
      <P>Hau called for the residents of Taipei City, which is responsible for 45 percent
of all Taiwan's cut flower sales and 70 percent of all pot plant sales, to use
flowers as offerings in place of burning incense or ghost money, which is
environmentally harmful.</P>
      <P>The Department of Air Quality Protection and Noise Control under the Cabinet-
level Environmental Protection Administration has called for the public to
refrain from burning ghost money and incense because toxic chemicals such as
benzene -- a known carcinogen -- and other pollutants are released during the
burning.</P>

    <HEADLINE>New U.N. bid `breaks Taiwan people's hearts': DPP caucus</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 15 (CNA)
08/15/08  17:30:39
(By Steve Bercic)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) deputy legislative caucus whip
claimed Friday that the ruling Kuomintang's new U.N. bid has "broken the hearts
of the Taiwan people."</P>
      <P>Pan Meng-an was referring  to a proposal emphasizing  the importance of Taiwan's
"meaningful participation" in the United Nations which was submitted to the U.N.
Secretariat the previous day by representatives of St. Vincent and the
Grenadines and the Solomon Islands, two diplomatic allies of the Republic of
China, at the request of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</P>
      <P>The proposal marks a fresh approach by the government in pushing for U.N. entry
for Taiwan since President Ma Ying-jeou assumed office May 20.</P>
      <P>The previous DPP administration applied in 2007 to join the U.N. as a full
member under the name Taiwan, the first time it had tried under that name.
However, that proposal failed to make the agenda of the U.N. General Assembly,
just as the previous ones since 1993 also failed.</P>
      <P>The new proposal, submitted ahead of this year's U.N. General Assembly set to
open Sept. 16, is significant in that it does not mention the name Taiwan nor
the idea of the Republic of China seeking to return to the world body.</P>
      <P>The ministry said the proposal was put forward on the principles of "dignity,
pragmatism and flexibility."</P>
      <P>Pan also claimed that Ma's proposed "diplomatic truce" with China is
hypocritical and a sign of surrender and a downgrading of Taiwan's status.</P>
      <P>The ministry's proposal put forward to the U.N. caters to "Ma's stance of
capitulation" and by omitting the name Taiwan, does not demonstrate the Taiwan
people's resolve to join the international community, according to Pan.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, DPP legislative whip Chang Hua-kan said Taiwan's sovereignty should
be insisted upon at all times, regardless of the international situation.</P>
      <P>Saying that membership of the U.N. gives a country "legitimacy, " Chang asked
how the government can put forward a proposal that does not include the
country's name.</P>
      <P>"If we don't even insist on our name, then we can't be considered a country," he
said.</P>
      <P>"And if that's the case, then we don't need foreign relations, " he went on,
asking whether the KMT's next step will be to abolish the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs and downgrade the government's status to that of a local government.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Chai Trong-rong said Ma's recent downplaying of his status as
president during his transit stop in the United States was aimed at catering to
China's demands, adding that the president has acted like "he wants to be a
model student of Beijing's."</P>
      <P>The new U.N. bid is the same in many respects in that it is based on a desire to
avoid angering Beijing, Chai said, adding that the bid has "cheated the Taiwan
people."</P>
      <P>He claimed that by not insisting on using the country's name, whether it be
Taiwan or the Republic of China, and deciding to settle the issue at a later
date, Ma has effectively allowed for foreigners to decide Taiwan's designation.</P>
      <P>"If the Taiwanese can't even be allowed to decide their country's name, how can
they decide their own future? " he asked, adding that Ma has broken his election
promise to act on behalf of the desires of the public.</P>

      <P>A Chiayi County farmers' association official urged agricultural authorities
Friday to help the county's papaya farmers cope with losses suffered as result
of a tornado and hailstorm that struck the southern county's Jhongpu township
the previous day.</P>
      <P>Chang Han-ching, a secretary of the Jhongpu Farmers Association, said the
tornado and hailstones damaged about 30 hectares of papaya plantations in
villages that included Jinlan, Fushou, Longmen, and Sanceng, causing losses of
millions of New Taiwan dollars.</P>
      <P>The screens on the screen houses were blown away and the fruit trees were either
snapped in half or toppled over, said Chang, adding that a whole year of hard
work by the papaya farmers was laid waste.</P>
      <P>Chang said that the Jhongpu Township Farmers' Association will help these

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan seeks meaningful participation in U.N. agencies</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 15 (CNA)
08/15/08  18:09:55
(By Neil Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced Friday that Taiwan, through its
allies, will ask the 63rd U.N. General Assembly to pass a resolution that would
allow Taiwan to participate meaningfully in specialized U.N. agencies, a
fundamental shift in its diplomatic campaign that previously sought full
membership of the world body.</P>
      <P>Deputy Foreign Minister Andrew Hsia said at a press conference that the U.N.
representatives of St. Vincent and the Grenadines and the Solomon Islands
earlier in the day introduced a resolution co-sponsored by 17 of Taiwan's 23
allies to the agenda of the 63rd U.N. General Assembly slated to begin Sept. 16,
kicking off Taiwan's latest effort to expand its international participation.</P>
      <P>Unlike in previous years -- particularly the last eight years under Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) rule -- the resolution, titled "Need to Examine the
Fundamental Rights of the 23 million People of the Republic of China (Taiwan) to
Participate Meaningfully in the Activities of the U.N. Specialized Agencies,"
does not request the assembly to consider Taiwan's membership or direct
participation in the U.N.</P>
      <P>"This is a more moderate, rational and feasible approach, " said Hsia of the new
initiative, which he described as reflecting the thoughts and aspirations of the
people of Taiwan for international participation, as well as the reality of the
current political situation in the international community.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan's efforts to join the U.N. since 1993 received no support
from any countries other than Taiwan's few diplomatic allies, Hsia said the
pragmatism of the new initiative received positive responses from ambassadors
and representatives stationed in Taipei during initial consultations.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's seat in the U.N. was given to China in 1971, when the U.N. passed
Resolution 2758, and the country has been denied access to all related U.N.
agencies and conventions ever since. Taiwan launched its efforts to return the
U.S. in 1993, but has had no success.</P>
      <P>During the eight-year period of DPP rule, Taiwan's applications were often seen
by the international community as moves toward Taiwan independence, particularly
last year, when former President Chen Shui-bian decided to apply for membership
under the name Taiwan.</P>
      <P>At present, there are 16 specialized agencies under the U.N. framework involved
in issues such as health, labor, intellectual property rights, meteorology and
aviation. Hsia said Taiwan's seeking of participation is not a political appeal,
but done out of humanitarian concerns.</P>
      <P>Admitting the prospects for Taiwan's U.N. status hinge on the attitude of China,
Hsia urged Beijing to understand the desires of the Taiwanese people, to show
goodwill to Taiwan's proposal and to not obstruct, warning that "an isolated
Taiwan is a disservice to relations across the Taiwan Strait."</P>
      <P>The U.N. campaign will be a crucial test for President Ma Ying-jeou's advocacy
of "pragmatic diplomacy, " or "modus vivendi" approach, and seeking a
"diplomatic truce" with China on both the domestic and cross-strait fronts.
Hsia said that under those concepts, the two sides should pursue co-operative
co-existence rather than confrontation.</P>
      <P>In light of strong criticism from the opposition DPP, which claims Ma's policy
is tantamount to giving up sovereignty, Hsia pointed out that meaningful
participation  does not rule out membership in international organizations in
the future and that Taiwan has not given up its appeal for formal membership in
the future.</P>
      <P>Even with what he called a moderate and practical approach, Hsia admitted that
it still is an extremely challenging task and that if the resolution can
successfully be included on the agenda it will be "big achievement." The U.N.
General Affairs Committee makes a final decision on the opening day of the
assembly when it discusses and reviews the draft agenda.</P>
      <P>As for the sensitive name issue, Hsia said that will be dealt with only after
the U.N. reaches consensus on the issue, and when each specialized agency starts
arranging Taiwan's participation. However, he ruled out the name Taiwan, China,
which is used by China and many international organizations, and emphasized that
the country's national dignity must be kept intact.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Consumers' Foundation, Chinese Taipei (CFCT) filed a complaint with the Fair
Trade Commission (FTC) against Microsoft Friday, urging the commission to impose
sanctions on the company for its termination of Windows XP in the Taiwanese
market.</P>
      <P>"We suggest that the commission penalize Microsoft with a heavy fine for
impairing market fairness, " CFCT acting Chairman Hsieh Tien-jen said when he
delivered the complaint to the FTC.</P>
      <P>Microsoft stopped selling the XP operating system in Taiwan at the end of June.
As the company has the lion's share of the local software market, estimated to
surpass 90 percent, local consumers have been left with little choice but to
purchase personal computers (PCs) bundled with Windows Vista, launched in 2007.</P>
      <P>The foundation June 30 urged Microsoft Taiwan Corp., the local branch of the
world's biggest software vendor, to reinstate sales of XP and to continue
technical support for XP users. However the company did not meet the demands.</P>
      <P>Officially submitting the complaint at the FTC office, Hsieh told reporters that
over half of local users would prefer to replace Vista with XP when buying a
Vista-bundled computer, citing a recent survey polled by his foundation.</P>
      <P>"Sixty-seven percent of local users want a return of XP to the market, " he went
on, citing the results of another poll and adding that Microsoft's marketing
strategy is an abuse of consumer rights.</P>
      <P>With fewer operating system options in the market, Hsieh went on, local
consumers might be discouraged from replacing their old computers.</P>
      <P>"This might also hurt the hardware business," he warned.</P>
      <P>Chou Ya Shu, an FTC commissioner, told CNA that since Aug. 4, the commission has
been investigating Microsoft's suspected exploitation of consumer choice by
using its dominant market share to promote Vista over XP.</P>
      <P>If the case is upheld, Microsoft will have to pay a maximum fine of NT$25
million (US$806,000) ,  said Chou,  who is also FTC spokeswoman.</P>
      <P>"We will review the CFCT's complaint and its suggestions on how we can
facilitate our investigation, " she said, although she refused to comment on how
long the investigation might last.</P>
      <P>The CFCT also suggested compulsory licensing of XP to allow local manufacturers
to fabricate the operating system,  bringing the software back to the market.</P>
      <P>"Since Microsoft no longer sells XP regardless of the market demand, such
licensing could bring the option back to the consumers," Hsieh noted.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Burning ghost money induces more asthma cases: doctor</HEADLINE>

      <P>Burning incense and ghost money during "ghost month, " the seventh month of the
lunar year, induces more asthma cases among children, a pediatrician said
Friday.</P>
      <P>Hsu Shih-ta, director of Mackay Memorial Hospital's Department of Immunology,
Allergy and Rheumatology, said the number of asthma cases induced by allergy has
increased by between 10 percent and 20 percent recently.</P>
      <P>In "ghost month, " which falls this year in the entire month of August, the
number of worship ceremonies is especially frequent and usually entails the
burning of paper "ghost money, " which produces the carcinogenic benzene and
other chemicals that are bad for the respiratory tract.</P>
      <P>According to traditional Chinese folk belief, souls are released from hell
during ghost month to mingle with the living.</P>
      <P>Burning ghost money began as a ritual to appease these spirits so they do not
create mischief or harm. Believers burn money year-round, but the activity
reaches a peak during ghost month, and especially on the 15th day of the month,
known as "ghost festival."</P>
      <P>Hsu pointed out that those who set up altars and burn incense in their homes
produce air pollutants that can accumulate.</P>
      <P>"When the concentration of air pollutants rises, it induces allergic reactions
among some children," he added.</P>
      <P>Hsu said that allergic reaction can also be cumulative, noting that after years
of living in an incense-burning environment, allergic reactions can become more
apparent.</P>
      <P>This, coupled with an average temperature difference of 7 degrees Celsius
between air-conditioned indoor areas and outdoor areas, has also contributed to
the rise in the number of asthma cases, he said.</P>
      <P>For this reason, Hsu went on, a well-ventilated house will help children
suffering from allergies and he advised opening windows for at least two hours
daily, even during hot weather.</P>
      <P>The Taipei city government's Department of Education recently announced that 20
percent of students at the city's junior high schools suffer from asthma.</P>
      <P>Statistics show that as many as 50 percent of students attending elementary
schools in the greater Taipei and greater Taichung areas suffer from allergy
problems.</P>

      <P>Former President Chen Shui-bian announced Friday his decision to give up his
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) membership together with his wife Wu Shu-jen,
in a show of apology for the disgrace he has brought to the party by his
dishonest management of his election campaign funds.</P>
      <P>Chen made the move one day after confessing that he lied about the election
campaign expenses for his two mayoral elections and two presidential elections
between 1993 and 2004 and that his wife wired surplus funds from the election
campaign contributions into overseas bank accounts.</P>
      <P>During a news conference held Friday, Chen said he does not expect the public to
forgive him for committing such a "serious mistake" and added that it was not
his intention to hurt the DPP.</P>
      <P>"Today, I have to sadly say `sorry' to all fellow party members and supporters,
for I have disappointed and disgraced all of you, have failed to live up to your
expectations and have done irreparable damage to the party," he said.</P>
      <P>Chen said that despite his withdrawal from the party, he will accept
investigation by the DPP's anti-corruption committee and will also face public
criticism and judicial investigation.</P>
      <P>He urged party supporters not to deny the DPP's efforts to protect Taiwan's
sovereignty, deepen Taiwan's democracy and pursue social justice, just because
of his personal mistake.</P>
      <P>The former president made the shocking confession Thursday after ruling
Kuomintang Legislator  Hung Hsiu-chu revealed copies of documents showing that
the Federal Department of Justice and Police of the Swiss Confederation was
requesting assistance from the Taiwanese authorities over suspected money
laundering by Chen's son Chen Chih-chung and daughter-in-law Huang Jui-ching
through two Swiss bank accounts.</P>
      <P>However, Chen claimed that all the surplus funds were handled by his wife and
that he had no idea his wife had wired the funds abroad until early this year.</P>
      <P>Hung's revelation came just one day after Next magazine reported that Chen's
daughter-in-law had laundered money for the former first family by secretly
wiring NT$300 million overseas in 2006, after the exposure of the "state affairs
fund" case.</P>
      <P>The former first lady was charged with corruption and forgery in November 2006
for using receipts provided by others to claim reimbursements totaling NT$14.8
million from the president's "state affairs fund" between July 2002 and March
2006.</P>
      <P>Chen, who had immunity from prosecution while in office, was named as a co-
defendant in the case as soon as he stepped down from the presidency May 20.</P>

      <P>Domestic gasoline and diesel prices were lowered Friday by NT$0.9 and NT$1 per
liter, respectively, for the second week in a row, thanks to recent a decline in
average international oil prices over the five previous trading days.</P>
      <P>According to a press statement issued by the state-owned oil company CPC Corp.
Taiwan, the adjustment will bring down the price of 92 unleaded to NT$32.5 and
that of diesel to NT$30.3 per liter.</P>
      <P>The new floating price mechanism, introduced Aug. 7 to review prices weekly
instead of monthly, adjusts domestic oil prices based on international average
oil prices during the period from the previous Friday to Thursday. The changes
become effective at 12 a.m. Saturday.</P>
      <P>The company decided on its first adjustment last Friday after the new mechanism
was introduced, cutting gasoline and diesel prices by NT$2 and NT$2.2 a liter,
respectively, due to cheaper crude oil prices.</P>
      <P>"Fuel prices in Taiwan remain the lowest among the country's Asian neighbors,"
the press release stated.</P>
      <P>Compared with the pre-tax 92 unleaded gasoline prices in South Korea, Japan and
Singapore, which stood Aug. 12 at NT$29.6, NT$32.27 and NT$28.71 per liter,
respectively, the price in Taiwan was NT$23.35 a liter prior to Friday's
adjustment.</P>
      <P>Explaining the range for the most recent adjustment, the press statement noted
that the international average price of US$118.35 per barrel from Aug. 1-7 had
slumped by a considerable 5.8 percent to US$111.47, which was the average price
for Aug. 8-14.</P>
      <P>However, offset by the recent decline of the new Taiwan dollar against the U.S.
dollar -- the domestic currency's weekly average fell to NT$31.167 from
NT$30.728 during the two-week period -- the lowering rate was narrowed to only
3.57 percent.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, CPC Corp. Taiwan's chief rival, the privately owned Formosa
Petrochemical Co., also lowered its gasoline and diesel prices by the same rate,
to NT$32.5 and NT$30.9  per liter, respectively.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's Olympic baseball team suffered a surprise defeat by China Friday in
Beijing, as it slipped from its 7-3 lead -- almost a sure win -- to lose the
match 7-8 in a runoff competition in the bottom of the 12th inning..</P>
      <P>Taiwan's team, known officially as Chinese Taipei, used Pan Wei-lun as its
starting pitcher. Pan pitched seven perfect innings and allowed the Chinese team
no runs. China used Wang Nan as its starting pitcher, but he was relieved in the
sixth inning.</P>
      <P>Chinese Taipei's strong hitter Lo Kuo-hui hit a solo home run in the top of the
fifth inning, which was followed by another run in the sixth inning by Peng
Cheng-min, who earned a walk, stole to second base and took advantage of a
series of errors by the opposing team to reach the home plate.</P>
      <P>China launched a counterattack in the bottom of the eighth inning, scoring three
runs after Chinese Taipei's middle relief pitcher Lo Chia-jen made a wild pitch
and then allowed two hits, which gave China a temporary lead of 3-2.</P>
      <P>Chinese Taipei scored another run in the top of the ninth inning when Chang
Chien-min contributed a two-base hit, resulting in a 3-3 tie that required a
runoff. China then replaced its second relief pitcher with Lu Jiangang in the
10th inning.</P>
      <P>The tie remained unbroken until the 12th inning, when Chinese Taipei used a
sacrifice bunt, an intentional walk and a string of hits to score four runs and
lead China by a score of 7-3.</P>
      <P>The almost sure victory of Chinese Taipei turned into a surprise reversal in the
bottom of the 12th inning, as its pitcher Yang Chien-fu, who took over in the
10th inning, allowed two hits that each resulted in two runs, followed by
another run scored as a result of an error by an outfielder, and the game ended
8-7 in favor of China.</P>
      <P>Commenting on Friday's match against China, hitter Lo said, "That is baseball --
you never know which team is going to win until the end of the game."</P>
      <P>According to Lo, the game against Japan the previous night apparently had a
negative effect on Chinese Taipei, because, delayed by rain, the game lasted
until 11:30 p.m., which meant that many of the players did not go to bed until 1
a.m. Friday -- only to be woken up early in the morning to prepare for the game
against China.</P>
      <P>"The tight schedule might have taken a toll on our physical strength, but that
should not be used as an excuse for our defeat by China," he said.</P>
      <P>In its two previous matches,  Chinese Taipei defeated the Netherlands 5-0 but
lost to Japan 1-6. It will play four more games in the round-robin competition
against Cuba, South Korea, the United States and Canada between Aug. 16 and 20.
It will have to win at least two more matches to make it into the semifinals on
Aug. 21.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.S. supports Taiwan's meaningful international participation: AIT</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) made no direct comment Friday on Taiwan's
new initiative to seek more international participation, but reiterated its
long-held position that "the U.S.  supports Taiwan's meaningful participation
as appropriate in organizations  in which full membership is not possible."</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced Friday that Taiwan, through its
allies, will ask the 63rd U.N. General Assembly to pass a resolution that would
allow Taiwan to participate meaningfully in specialized U.N. agencies, a
fundamental shift in its diplomatic campaign that previously sought full
membership of the world body.</P>
      <P>AIT spokesman Thomas Hodges declined to comment on Taiwan's proposal being
introduced to the forthcoming U.N. General Assembly, but referred to the long-
held U.S. position on the issue of Taiwan's participation in international
organizations.</P>
      <P>-- The U.S. does not support Taiwan's membership in international organizations
in which statehood is a prerequisite, including the United Nations.</P>
      <P>-- As we have noted many times previously, the U.S. does support Taiwan's
meaningful participation as appropriate in organizations in which full
membership is not possible.</P>
      <P>-- We do support Taiwan's membership in organizations in which statehood is not
a requirement.</P>
      <P>Asked if the U.S. position was taken into consideration in the decision-making
process, Deputy Foreign Minister Andrew Hsia said at a Ministry of Foreign
Affairs press conference that the ministry held consultations with ambassadors
and representatives stationed in Taipei on the issue and that the initial
response was very positive.</P>
      <P>"This is a more moderate, rational, practical and feasible approach, " said Hsia
of the new initiative, which he described as reflecting the thoughts and
aspirations of the people of Taiwan regarding international participation, as
well as the reality of the present international political situation.</P>
      <P>However, Hsia admitted that foreign countries will not adopt an official
position until they have studied and reviewed Taiwan's initiative.</P>
      <P>The U.S. position on Taiwan's bids to enter the international arena can be best
observed in terms of the World Health Organization (WHO), as it supports
Taiwan's meaningful participation in the global health framework and the
country's status as an observer in the World Health Assembly -- the highest
decision body of the WHO -- but is opposed to Taiwan's full WHO membership.</P>

      <P>The Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA) will organize three
delegations to visit China after the end of Beijing Olympic Games later this
month to promote sales of Taiwanese farm produce, a TAITRA official said Friday.</P>
      <P>According to the TAITRA official, more than 100 companies in agricultural and
food processing industries will target wealthy areas believed to have the most

      <P>Representatives from the 100-plus companies will be divided into three groups to
tap markets in northeastern, eastern and western parts of China, respectively,
the official said.</P>
      <P>The TAITRA official said that Taiwanese firms will exhibit more than 200

      <P>Four award-winning taekwondo athletes, seen as Taiwan's Olympic medal hopefuls,
left Taipei Friday to take part in the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games.</P>
      <P>The four Taiwanese athletes, who will compete under the official name "Chinese
Taipei," are Chu Mu-yen, Yang Shu-chun, Su Li-wen, and Sung Yu-chi.  Each of
them  has won medals  in international competitions.</P>
      <P>Chu, fighting in the men's under-58kg division, won Taiwan's second gold medal
in the 2004 Athens Olympic Games at the age of 22.</P>
      <P>Yang, who is Chu's girlfriend, was the champion in the women's under-49kg event
in the Asian taekwondo tournament in April this year. She is hoping for success
in the women's competition in the Beijing Olympics.</P>
      <P>Su captured a gold medal in the women's under-63kg event in the Doha Asian Games
in August 2007, while Sung won the gold medal in the men's under-72kg category
in the 2007 Beijing WTF World Taekwondo Championships.</P>
      <P>As a team, they underwent a spiritual program in a Buddhist temple in southern
Taiwan to reduce mental stress and get them in the best psychological state for
the forthcoming competitions.</P>
      <P>Chu told reporters before the team's departure that he will do his best to prove
to the world that a former Taiwanese gold medal winner also has the ability to
retain his title in Beijing. He acknowledged that his strongest opponents are
from Germany, Spain and Iran.</P>
      <P>Yang expressed  confidence  that she is now at her best. Acknowledging that each
match will be important to her, she said she will put out her best performance,
with her prime targets being the competitors from China, Cuba and Canada.</P>
      <P>Su said that her immediate goal is to make it into the final-four competition,
while Sung said his major opponents are from South Korea, and that he would try
to turn pressure into a force in his favor.</P>
      <P>Taekwondo is one of a few sports categories in which Taiwan has a good chance to
win medals. In the Athens Olympics in 2004, three of the country's five medals,
including two golds, were won in the taekwondo competition.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Cross-strait economic negotiations hard task: SEF chief</HEADLINE>

      <P>Cross-Taiwan Strait economic talks will be a very difficult task, particularly
for Taiwan, which is seeking to better protect its business interests in China
and further sharpen its economic presence in Southeast Asia, said Taiwan's top
negotiator with China Friday.</P>
      <P>"Cross-strait economic talks, which probably would resume next year, would be
the most 'difficult' part of the Taiwan-China negotiations," said Straits
Exchange Foundation (SEF) Chairman Chiang Pin-kung.</P>
      <P>Chiang made the remarks during a speech at a seminar sponsored by the Taiwan
Competitiveness Forum on the prospects of cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>According to Chiang, the SEF and Beijing-based Association for Relations Across
the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) would rekindle bilateral negotiations by starting
with economic issues before political issues. "Starting with less complex issues
is our principle for negotiations," he said.</P>
      <P>In line with this principle, the SEF and ARATS might resume economic talks on
protecting Taiwan business interests and several key financial issues in 2009,
he said. The industrial upgrade of Taiwan businesses in China is one of the
critical issues to be discussed, he added.</P>
      <P>In addition, he said, it is very important for Taiwan to discuss with China the
"ASEAN Plus Three" forum, if Taiwan hopes to join the regional trade
organization.</P>
      <P>"ASEAN Plus Three" is a forum that functions as a coordinator of cooperation
between the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and the three East Asian
nations of China, Japan and South Korea.</P>
      <P>Now that China, Japan and South Korea are absorbing as much as 65 percent of
Taiwan's total exports, the establishment of "ASEAN Plus Three" will definitely
have a huge negative impact on Taiwan if it cannot take part in the trade bloc,
Chiang said.</P>
      <P>"If Taiwan could first have talks with China over its possible role in ASEAN,
other ASEAN member states would not have to worry about pressure from Beijing,"
he argued. "However, this would be the most difficult task in cross-strait
economic negotiations."</P>
      <P>Taiwan and China would have to discuss a broad range of issues to "normalize"
two-way trade and commerce relations, as the two sides did not hold any
bilateral talks prior to their admission to the World Trade Organization in
2002, Chiang said.</P>
      <P>Apart from the recent economic measures implemented by President Ma Ying-jeou
with the aim of boosting cross-strait exchanges, there are other relevant issues
on which Taiwan and China need to negotiate, he added.</P>
      <P>Concerning the establishment of full direct airlinks across the strait, Chiang
said the SEF and the ARATS are set to negotiate on pending core issues such as
destinations, flight numbers, route courses and cargo charter flights.</P>
      <P>As current shipping links between Taiwan and China are conducted via Japan's
Okinawa, the two sides will also discuss direct shipping services to help
enterprises save some 500 million Japanese yen each year and effectively bolster
their competitiveness, he said.</P>
      <P>The SEF chief contended that Taiwan should use its economic clout and democratic
values as a means of maintaining its distinctive image and its own identity on
the world stage.</P>
      <P>The SEF and ARATS are semiofficial bodies responsible for cross-strait dealings
in the absence of official contacts since 1949, when Taiwan and China split amid
a Chinese civil war.</P>
      <P>The intermediary organizations clinched two historical deals in Beijing in June
to set up direct weekend passenger charter flights and to allow more Chinese
tourists to visit Taiwan from July.</P>

      <P>Five Nigerians -- four men and a woman -- were detained in Taipei and Tainan
Thursday and Friday, respectively, by law enforcement officials for allegedly
swindling money from so-called investors, Hsinchu City police said Friday.</P>
      <P>Police officers from Hsinchu City and Hsinchu County in northern Taiwan arrested
the five Nigerians, who included one naturalized Taiwanese, in separate raids in
northern Taipei County and Tainan County in the south, a spokesman said.</P>
      <P>Police tracked down the five suspects after receiving a telephone call from a
Philippine woman who said she was the wife of a Taiwanese man and claimed to
have been swindled by a foreign fraud ring that targeted both locals and
foreigners.</P>
      <P>Acting on the tip, police nabbed a woman from Nigeria and found that she had
overstayed her tourist visa after she entered Taiwan last year.</P>
      <P>Police investigation showed that the Nigerian woman also set up a dummy company
in Taiwan and pretended to run a second-hand car business to defraud investors.</P>
      <P>The Philippine woman told the police that she had been defrauded of some
NT$500,000 (US$15,923) by the Nigerian woman and that she had only recently
learnt that the Nigerian was a member of a fraud ring. The ring, composed of
foreigners, asked her to remit an additional NT$250,000, the Filipina said.</P>
      <P>Police also found that the Nigerian fraud ring had racked up profits by shipping
used cars, which they had obtained illegally in Taiwan, to their country.</P>
      <P>The police, suspecting that the five Nigerians may have been involved in other
illegal activities, have launched an in-depth investigation into the matter.</P>

      <P>Minister of Justice Wang Ching-feng on Friday urged prosecutors to accelerate
their probe into the allegations of money laundering involving family members of
former President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>She said that a speedy investigation will help restore the public's faith in the
justice system.</P>
      <P>Wang made the remarks one day after it was reported that the Swiss
Confederation's Federal Department of Justice Police had sought Taiwan's
assistance in probing a possible case of money laundering in Switzerland by
Chen's son Chen Chih-chung and daughter-in-law Huang Jui-ching.</P>
      <P>Wang said that she felt "sadness and regret" upon learning earlier in the day
that Chen Chih-chung and his wife already left Taiwan last Saturday.</P>
      <P>Wang said that as far as she knows, head prosecutor Ching Chi-jen, who is
assigned the case, has compiled related documents and information, including the
indictment of former first lady Wu Shu-jen in a high-profile "state affairs
fund" case.</P>
      <P>Ching left for Switzerland Aug. 12 to deliver the documents to the Swiss
authorities and to provide other relevant information, she added.</P>
      <P>Wu was charged with corruption and forgery in November 2006 on grounds that she
had used receipts provided by the others to claim reimbursements totalling
NT$14.8 million from the president's "state affairs fund" between July 2002 and
March 2006.</P>
      <P>Former President Chen, who was named as a co-defendant in the case but had
immunity from prosecution while in office, is now under investigation.</P>
      <P>The former president apologized to the nation Thursday, admitting that he had
not faithfully accounted for his campaign expenses in his two mayoral elections
and two presidential elections between 1993 and 2004, but claimed that he was
unaware, until early this year, that the surplus funds had been wired abroad by
his wife.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the opposition Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP's) Taipei chapter
convened an executive committee meeting Friday and all 13 members who were
present unanimously agreed that Chen Chih-chung and Huang Jui-ching should be
stripped of their party membership next Monday in a meeting of the party's

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou, who is in Paraguay to attend the inauguration of
Paraguayan President Fernando Lugo, was accorded the same high level of respect
as other heads of state at the ceremony on Friday morning, and he interacted
with some of them.</P>
      <P>Ma, who arrived at the inauguration venue around 8:20 a.m. local time, traveled
there behind the motorcade of Chilean President Michelle Bachelet and ahead of
Ecuador President Rafael Correa.</P>
      <P>A broadcaster on the local television channel "Tele futuro" introduced  Taiwan
as having the largest delegation among all countries attending the inauguration.
There were more than 25 media groups at the parliamentary square where the
ceremony was held.</P>
      <P>Ma was escorted to his seat along with other heads of state, and placed between
Venezuela President Hugo Chavez and Spanish Crown Prince Felipe with whom he
exchanged greetings.</P>
      <P>The ceremony commenced with the singing of the Paraguayan national anthem in
both Spanish and the local Guarani language.</P>
      <P>Lugo began his inauguration speech by thanking the 10 heads of state present for
attending the ceremony. The leaders were from Brazil,  Chili, Bolivia,
Argentina, Uruguay, Ecuador, Honduras, Venezuela, Republic of China Taiwan and
Spain.</P>
      <P>Lugo vowed to do great things for the salvation of Paraguay's poorest people.</P>
      <P>"Paraguay's era of corruption is going to end, " Lugo pledged. "I will continue
to fulfill the dreams the country had when it was first established."</P>
      <P>"The change in country will be not only in the political leadership, but also in
the entire culture," he added.</P>
      <P>Ma listened  attentively  to the 43-minute  speech via an interpreter.</P>
      <P>Later at a religious ceremony at the Metropolitan Cathedral of Asuncion, Ma
showcased his diplomatic skills by conversing easily with Prince Felipe before
the start.</P>
      <P>Lugo, a former Roman Catholic bishop, won a historic victory in Paraguay's
presidential election, ending more than six decades of rule by the central-right
Colorado Party.</P>
      <P>Dubbed the "bishop of the poor, " the 56-year-old Lugo vowed to improve the
economy of the developing South American nation and to clean up practices that
have given Paraguay a reputation as a corrupt country and a safe haven for
smugglers.</P>
      <P>Lugo retired as a Catholic bishop in December 2006 to sidestep Paraguay's
constitutional ban on the clergy seeking public office.</P>
      <P>Lugo had said during his campaign that he would like to establish relations with
China if elected, giving rise to speculations that Taiwan might lose its only
diplomatic ally in South America to China.</P>
      <P>However, after meeting with Ma on Thursday morning, the two vowed to maintain
and consolidate bilateral relations.</P>
      <P>Ma, who is making his first state visit since he took office May 20, is
scheduled to leave Paraguay at 4 p.m. local time for the Dominican Republic to

official said that the representative office received the letter,  dated June
16,  in early July but the correspondence did not reach the MOFA until late
July.</P>
      <P>George Liu, Taiwan's de facto representative to Switzerland, told the CNA that
the Swiss Department of Justice sent the letter to his office via ordinary mail,
and did not mark it as confidential.</P>
      <P>Liu said he therefore forwarded the letter to the MOFA via the ordinary mailing
process, but unfortunately, it missed the weekly post and was delayed for
another week.</P>
      <P>In the letter, Swiss authorities requested judicial assistance in probing a case
of possible money laundering in Switzerland by former President Chen Shui-bian's
son Chen Chih-chung and daughter-in-law Huang Jui-ching.</P>
      <P>The MOFA official said that the ministry, after listening to the the
explanations by Liu and other staff members, concluded that the letter had not
been deliberately delayed, but that the representative office had shown a "lack
of political judgment."</P>
      <P>Nonetheless, the ministry announced Friday that Liu will be replaced by Vice
Economic Affairs Minister Hsieh Fa-ta.</P>
      <P>Liu, a former Taiwan Solidarity Union legislator, offered in June to resign and
tendered a written resignation to Foreign Affairs Minister Francisco H. L. Ou in
late July.</P>
      <P>A Taiwan prosecutor departed for Switzerland Aug. 12 and is expected to review
the deposits and withdrawals of accounts created under the name of Huang Jui-
ching at Merrill Lynch Bank.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CEC forms panel to study ex-president's campaign funding</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 15 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Central Election Commission (CEC) has formed a special task force to study
issues regarding former President Chen Shui-bian's confession that he had not
faithfully declared his election campaign expenses, an official said Friday.</P>
      <P>The commission took the step a day after Chen confessed that he had lied about
the campaign expenses for his two mayoral elections and two presidential
elections between 1993 and 2004 and that his wife had wired surplus funds from
the election campaign contributions to overseas bank accounts.</P>
      <P>"The nine-member task force will meet Aug. 20 to discuss whether the CEC is in a
position to deal with the case under the current law provisions, " said CEC
Secretary-General Teng Tien-you after a CEC commissioners meeting.</P>
      <P>According to Teng, the provisions related to campaign funding, stipulated in the
Public Officials Election and Recall Law, were deleted in an amendment passed in
November 2007. The campaign funding provisions prescribed in the President and
Vice President Election and Recall Law were also frozen after the Political
Contributions Act took effect in March this year.</P>
      <P>However, as Chen's mayoral and presidential elections were held during periods
when those regulations were still valid, Teng said, the CEC panel will consider
whether Chen can be held accountable in accordance with the now-defunct
regulations.</P>
      <P>According to CEC data, Chen declared his 2004 presidential campaign expenses at
slightly more than NT$1.2 billion and reported his 2000 campaign expenditures at
NT$949 million.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, Chen announced his withdrawal from the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) in a show of apology for the disgrace he has brought to
the party by his dishonest management of his campaign funds.</P>
      <P>"Today, it is with great sadness that I apologize to all party members and
supporters. I let everybody down and did irreparable harm to the party. This was
not my intention but I made mistakes, " Chen said in a statement. "To show my
deepest remorse, my wife and I will leave the DPP now."</P>
      <P>He also urged DPP supporters not to abandon the party's efforts to protect
Taiwan's sovereignty, deepen Taiwan's democracy and pursue social justice, just
because of his personal mistake.</P>
      <P>Chen made the surprise  confession  Thursday  after ruling Kuomintang Legislator
Hung Hsiu-chu revealed copies of documents showing that the Federal Department
of Justice and Police of the Swiss Confederation was requesting assistance from
Taiwan in case of suspected money laundering  by Chen's son Chen Chih-chung and
daughter-in-law Huang Jui-ching through two Swiss bank accounts.</P>
      <P>The confession is seen to add to Chen's legal woes, since it comes as the former
president is already battling charges that he misused public funds.</P>
      <P>Chen's wife was charged with corruption and forgery in November 2006 for using
receipts provided by others to claim reimbursements totaling NT$14.8 million
from the president's "state affairs fund" between July 2002 and March 2006.</P>
      <P>Chen, who was immune to prosecution while in office, was named as a co-defendant
in the case as soon as he stepped down from the presidency May 20. ENDITE</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Justice Wang Ching-feng on Friday urged prosecutors to accelerate
their probe into the allegations of money laundering involving family members of
former President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>She said that a speedy investigation will help restore the public's faith in the
justice system.</P>
      <P>Wang made the remarks one day after it was reported that the Swiss
Confederation's Federal Department of Justice Police had sought Taiwan's
assistance in probing a possible case of money laundering in Switzerland by
Chen's son Chen Chih-chung and daughter-in-law Huang Jui-ching.</P>
      <P>Wang said that she felt "sadness and regret" upon learning earlier in the day
that Chen Chih-chung and his wife already left Taiwan last Saturday.</P>
      <P>Wang said that as far as she knows, head prosecutor Ching Chi-jen, who is
assigned the case, has compiled related documents and information, including the
indictment of former first lady Wu Shu-jen in a high-profile "state affairs
fund" case.</P>
      <P>Ching left for Switzerland Aug. 12 to deliver the documents to the Swiss
authorities and to provide other relevant information, she added.</P>
      <P>Wu was charged with corruption and forgery in November 2006 on grounds that she
had used receipts provided by the others to claim reimbursements totalling
NT$14.8 million from the president's "state affairs fund" between July 2002 and
March 2006.</P>
      <P>Former President Chen, who was named as a co-defendant in the case but had
immunity from prosecution while in office, is now under investigation.</P>
      <P>The former president apologized to the nation Thursday, admitting that he had
not faithfully accounted for his campaign expenses in his two mayoral elections
and two presidential elections between 1993 and 2004, but claimed that he was
unaware, until early this year, that the surplus funds had been wired abroad by
his wife.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the opposition Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP's) Taipei chapter
convened an executive committee meeting Friday and all 13 members who were
present unanimously agreed that Chen Chih-chung and Huang Jui-ching should be
stripped of their party membership next Monday in a meeting of the party's
Taipei city advisory committee.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou, who is in Paraguay to attend the inauguration of
Paraguayan President Fernando Lugo, was accorded the same high level of respect
as other heads of state at the ceremony on Friday morning, and he interacted
with some of them.</P>
      <P>Ma, who arrived at the inauguration venue around 8:20 a.m. local time, traveled
there behind the motorcade of Chilean President Michelle Bachelet and ahead of
Ecuador President Rafael Correa.</P>
      <P>A broadcaster on the local television channel "Tele futuro" introduced  Taiwan
as having the largest delegation among all countries attending the inauguration.
There were more than 25 media groups at the parliamentary square where the
ceremony was held.</P>
      <P>Ma was escorted to his seat along with other heads of state, and placed between
Venezuela President Hugo Chavez and Spanish Crown Prince Felipe with whom he
exchanged greetings.</P>
      <P>The ceremony commenced with the singing of the Paraguayan national anthem in
both Spanish and the local Guarani language.</P>
      <P>Lugo began his inauguration speech by thanking the 10 heads of state present for
attending the ceremony. The leaders were from Brazil,  Chili, Bolivia,
Argentina, Uruguay, Ecuador, Honduras, Venezuela, Republic of China Taiwan and
Spain.</P>
      <P>Lugo vowed to do great things for the salvation of Paraguay's poorest people.</P>
      <P>"Paraguay's era of corruption is going to end, " Lugo pledged. "I will continue
to fulfill the dreams the country had when it was first established."</P>
      <P>"The change in country will be not only in the political leadership, but also in
the entire culture," he added.</P>
      <P>Ma listened  attentively  to the 43-minute  speech via an interpreter.</P>
      <P>Later at a religious ceremony at the Metropolitan Cathedral of Asuncion, Ma
showcased his diplomatic skills by conversing easily with Prince Felipe before
the start.</P>
      <P>Lugo, a former Roman Catholic bishop, won a historic victory in Paraguay's
presidential election, ending more than six decades of rule by the central-right
Colorado Party.</P>
      <P>Dubbed the "bishop of the poor, " the 56-year-old Lugo vowed to improve the
economy of the developing South American nation and to clean up practices that
have given Paraguay a reputation as a corrupt country and a safe haven for
smugglers.</P>
      <P>Lugo retired as a Catholic bishop in December 2006 to sidestep Paraguay's
constitutional ban on the clergy seeking public office.</P>
      <P>Lugo had said during his campaign that he would like to establish relations with
China if elected, giving rise to speculations that Taiwan might lose its only
diplomatic ally in South America to China.</P>
      <P>However, after meeting with Ma on Thursday morning, the two vowed to maintain
and consolidate bilateral relations.</P>
      <P>Ma, who is making his first state visit since he took office May 20, is
scheduled to leave Paraguay at 4 p.m. local time for the Dominican Republic to
attend the inauguration of President-elect Leonel Fernandez. He will return to
Taiwan on Aug. 19.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Friday that Taiwan will be pleased to see Taiwan's
allies developing substantive relations with China, just as Taiwan would like to
do the same with China's allies.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks during a meeting with Honduras President Manuel Zelaya
aboard a charter flight they took along with Guatemalan Vice President Rafael
Espada from Paraguay to the Dominican Republic after attending the inauguration
of Paraguayan President Fernando Lugo.</P>
      <P>In response to a question from Zelaya on how Taiwan's solid allies should react
to the fact that relations between Taiwan and China have significantly improved,
Ma vowed that nothing will change these longstanding friendships.</P>
      <P>"The idea of 'diplomatic reconciliation and diplomatic truce' that I have
proposed is aimed at improving cross-Taiwan Strait relations, " Ma was quoted as
saying by Presidential Office spokesman Wang Yu-chi. "As for our allies who have
supported us all this time, we will only consolidate bilateral friendships even
more," he said.</P>
      <P>"If our allies would like to develop substantive relations, such as economic or
cultural relations, with China, Taiwan will be pleased to see that as well, just
as Taiwan would like to do the same with China's allies," he added.</P>
      <P>The frosty relations between Taiwan and China have been thawing since Ma took
office May 20, and his proposal of a "diplomatic truce" is aimed at terminating
the longstanding diplomatic tug-of-war with China in which both countries try to
lure each other's allies to switch diplomatic allegiance by offering large sums
of money in foreign aid to developing countries.</P>
      <P>Ma also touted the strategy of "modus vivendi" or "pragmatic diplomacy,"
designed to leverage more international space for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He said  the improved  cross-strait  relations  have  been well-received by the
United States, Taiwan's allies and other countries in the region.</P>
      <P>"Diplomatic  truce is a strategy  that serves multilateral interests, as not
only relations between Taiwan and China are improved but relations between
Taiwan and the U.S.  are also improved," Ma stated.</P>
      <P>"Allies of both Taiwan and China will all benefit from improved cross-strait
relations," he added.</P>
      <P>Wang said Ma and Zelaya had a 20-minute discussion in which they also promised
to strengthen bilateral cooperation.</P>
      <P>He told reporters that the arrangement for Zelaya and Espada to take the charter
flight was made before Ma left Taiwan for his first state visit after assuming
office.</P>
      <P>Ma is scheduled to attend the inauguration of President Leonel Fernandez to a
new term in office Aug. 16. He will return to Taiwan Aug. 19.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Vincent Siew said Friday that Taiwan welcomes the development of
a strategic business alliance with Japan to establish a global business network.</P>
      <P>Siew made the remarks during a meeting at the Presidential Office with Yorihiko
Kojima, president of Japan's Mitsubishi Corp., the largest Japanese general
trading company with over 200 bases of operations in approximately 80 countries
worldwide. The company's Taiwan operation has 126 employees.</P>
      <P>"Now is the best time for Japan to invest in Taiwan, which, with advantage of
location and a more relaxed investment environment, can serve as a launch pad
for Japan in seeking market expansion in Southeast Asia and China, " Siew told
his guest.</P>
      <P>He emphasized that after a series of lifting of restrictions, Taiwan and China
will have more frequent trade contact and a more flexible platform for
negotiations  on logistics and personnel exchanges.</P>
      <P>He noted that Japan has always been Taiwan's largest source of imports and the
country's second-largest trade partner.</P>
      <P>He continued that the reason Taiwan continues to seek closer cooperation with
Japan despite decades of trade deficit is that it is hopeful of forming a
bilateral strategic business alliance.</P>
      <P>Kojima told Siew that he is well aware of Taiwan's importance in terms of
business strategy and will promote bilateral or multilateral cooperation to help
expand the two countries' business market.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs is set to hold two seminars later this month to
introduce strategies to Taiwanese companies planning to invest in China for
dealing with disputes with the Chinese authorities and the assistance that is
available to them in handling any problems they might encounter.</P>
      <P>The ministry decided to offer the seminars following the lifting of several
restrictions on cross-Taiwan Strait investment and trade exchanges in recent
months by the ruling Kuomintang administration.</P>
      <P>The seminars will be held in Taichung City in central Taiwan and in Taipei City
on Aug. 28 and 29, respectively, according to the ministry.</P>
      <P>Legal and business experts have been invited to the seminars to introduce some
of the main problems faced by Taiwan-based companies operating in China, as well
as response strategies for dealing with problems arising as a result of the
recent rapid changes in the investment climate and regulations in China, the
ministry said.</P>
      <P>According to a recent survey by the General Chamber of Commerce of the Republic
of China of listed and over-the-counter companies in Taiwan, the five major
areas of dispute involving Taiwanese companies operating in China are labor
issues, tax administration problems, intellectual  property  rights  disputes,
friction  with local governments and land issues.</P>
      <P>The seminars are aimed at offering suggestions to Taiwanese companies on how to
lower their business risks and ensure their rights when investing in China, the
ministry said.</P>

      <P>The Chinese Taipei baseball team's Olympic medal hopes dimmed considerably with
their 1-0 loss at the hands of the Cubans Saturday in Beijing, despite a strong
pitching performance by starter Lee Chen-chang.</P>
      <P>Lee pitched a solid six and two-thirds innings, giving up just three hits and
striking out seven of the Cuban sluggers along the way.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, one of those hits was a lead-off homer by number five batter
Frederich Cepeda in the seventh inning, which proved to be the winner in this
tight pitching duel.</P>
      <P>The Chinese Taipei batters were unable to solve Cuban starter Elier Sanchez, who
pitched seven shut-out innings, giving up just three hits and three bases on
balls. Norberto Gonzalez came on in relief to start the eighth inning and shut
down the Taiwan squad the rest of the way, picking up his second save of the
Beijing Olympics.</P>
      <P>Chinese Taipei had been hoping to redeem themselves following their humiliating
8-7 extra-inning loss to lowly China the previous day.</P>
      <P>The loss to Cuba dropped Chinese Taipei to a record of 1-3 in round-robin play
and put them on the verge of elimination.</P>
      <P>The team will now have to win its three remaining contests against South Korea,
the United States and Canada over the next three days to have any hope of making
it to the semi-finals and a chance at Olympic gold.</P>

      <P>Studio Classroom, an English-learning periodical publisher in Taiwan, has won
the Asian Publishing Award, a prize that recognizes best publishing practices in
Asia, for its creative Internet marketing, Studio Classroom General Manager
Simon Hung said Saturday.</P>
      <P>According to Hung, Studio Classroom won the award for content delivery,  which
refers  to circulation-  and audience-building activities, including the
development of multimedia channels, in the category of Asian Magazine Management
Awards.</P>
      <P>The publishing company, founded in 1962 by Doris Brougham, known in Chinese as
Peng Meng-huei, won another award in the same category last year.</P>
      <P>As part of its eight-month marketing activities in celebration of its 45th
anniversary, Studio Classroom successfully introduced its three magazines to a
wider readership via Internet tools such as Yahoo! Kimo's Widget engine, a
software system for running applets on Web pages or desktops with which users
can interact.</P>
      <P>The tool allows English learners to reach Studio Classroom's teaching resources
easily and quickly. For example, they can listen to daily radio programs of its
three magazines any time they like, and can learn new phrases and vocabulary
from the magazine content, with a clock device that provides time management for
learning.</P>
      <P>The awarded marketing strategy also includes a blog that promotes an activity
called "Give Me Ten, " which invites English learners to talk in English for at
least 10 minutes every day to overcome their fear of using the language in daily
life.</P>
      <P>People can upload photos and articles about their practice of the activity to
the blog and they can learn from other people's experience, and thus, a
community of English learners is formed, Hung said.</P>
      <P>"Tens of thousands of people have left messages on the blog within months to
share their experience of learning English with others, " Hung said, adding that
the publisher will soon launch its new "Mobile-magazine" that will allow people
to read magazine content on their cell phones.</P>
      <P>A total of 203 projects from 22 countries competed for 11 awards in the program
this year, and the award ceremony was held in Singapore Friday, Hung said.</P>
      <P>The honor in the Asian stage came one day after Advanced -- one of the
publisher's three magazines -- won the 2008 Golden Tripod Best Language Learning
Media Award, Taiwan's most prestigious award for publications, Hung said.</P>
      <P>The magazine won the same domestic award four years ago.</P>

      <P>Law enforcement officials searched the Taipei home and office of former
President Chen Shui-bian Saturday for evidence in connection with his public
fund embezzlement case and his suspected money-laundering case.</P>
      <P>Three prosecutors questioned Chen and his wife, Wu Shu-jen, at their home in the
upscale Hsinyi district of eastern Taipei.</P>
      <P>Chu Chao-liang, one of the three prosecutors, said "both Chen and Wu gave a
frank explanation about their capital source and its flow."</P>
      <P>But he said that because Wu pleaded ill-health, they did not put her words on
record as an affidavit.</P>
      <P>Chu said the prosecution will have to study the documents and information they
gathered from the house.</P>
      <P>According to media reports said the former first lady told the prosecutors that
the funds she secreted in overseas bank accounts come from four sources: her own
family; Chen's earnings as a lawyer before he went into politics; political
contributions and earnings from investments.</P>
      <P>However, Chen admitted in a news conference Thursday that he did not faithfully
account for the election campaign expenses for his two mayoral elections and two
presidential elections between 1993 and 2004. He claimed that he was unaware
that the surplus funds of US$20 million were wired abroad by his wife until
early this year.</P>
      <P>The search came after the Ministry of Foreign Affairs confirmed Thursday that
the Swiss authorities had requested judicial assistance from Taiwan in a probe
into a possible money laundering case in Switzerland involving Chen's son Chen
Chih-chung and daughter-in-law Huang Jui-ching.</P>
      <P>Taipei Head Prosecutor Ching Chi-jen left Taiwan for Switzerland Aug. 12,
bringing with her related documents and information, including an indictment of
Wu in the "state affairs fund" embezzlement case.</P>
      <P>Ching is expected to review the deposits and withdrawals of bank accounts
created under Huang's name at the Merrill Lynch Bank.</P>
      <P>The prosecution barred Chen Chih-chung and his wife from leaving Taiwan
Thursday, but both had already traveled to the United States last Saturday.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors reportedly asked the former president and first lady to advise the
two to return to Taiwan early to answer questions.</P>
      <P>Wu was charged with corruption and forgery in November 2006 for using receipts
provided by others to claim reimbursements totaling NT$14.8 million from the
president's "state affairs fund" between July 2002 and March 2006.</P>
      <P>However, she has attended only the first court hearing of the case and has since
refused to appear in court to answer the charges, claiming "ill-health."</P>
      <P>Chen, who was named as a co-defendant in the case but enjoyed immunity from
prosecution while in office, began to be questioned as soon as he stepped down
from the presidency May 20.</P>

      <P>Husbands' support is the greatest aid for women who are breastfeeding their
babies, while the absence of breastfeeding areas in public places is the top
hindrance to their feeding options, according to the results of a survey
released Saturday.</P>
      <P>The survey of more than 1,000 breastfeeding mothers was conducted by the Taiwan
Academy of Breastfeeding (TAB) between late July and early August.</P>
      <P>The survey results found that more than half of the respondents cited their
husbands as their No.  1 supporters  in choosing breastfeeding.</P>
      <P>More than 10 percent recognized counseling services and technical assistance of
medical institutions as useful supports in feeding their babies with breast
milk, according to the survey results.</P>
      <P>The poll also found that nearly 30 percent of the respondents complained that
public places are the most unfriendly to those wishing to breastfeed. The
absence of dedicated breasfeeding rooms in most local public places often forces
young mothers to breastfeed their children in restrooms, some respondents
pointed out.</P>
      <P>Mothers-in-law and neighbors were cited by many respondents as the two other
factors discouraging them from breastfeeding, the survey results show. According
to the respondents, many uninformed mothers-in-law do not want their
grandchildren to be breast-fed because they think breast milk is "not
nutritious" and might hinder their grandchildren's healthy development. Some
mothers-in-law were also said to have no confidence in the breastfeeding skills
of their daughters-in-law.</P>
      <P>The survey further found that more women are willing to opt for breastfeeding
amid the current economic downturn.</P>
      <P>Analyzing the survey findings, a TAB spokeswoman said the government should push
for a law revision to extend maternity leave or come up with new legislation to
offer paid parental leave to encourage breastfeeding.</P>
      <P>She also called for the government to install breastfeeding rooms in as many
public places as possible to create a friendlier environment for breastfeeding.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the academy has prepared free promotional postcards that the public
can pick up and present to young breastfeeding mothers to encourage, support and
thank them, the spokeswoman said.</P>

      <P>Some 6,600 people participated Saturday in the 19th fast organized by the World
Vision Taiwan charity to "experience the pain of hunger" and raise social
awareness of the global food crisis.</P>
      <P>The rally, titled "30 Hour Famine", was co-sponsored by World Vision Taiwan and
the 7-Eleven convenience store chain.</P>
      <P>A total of 6,600 "famine heroes " from around the country -- from elementary
school pupils to people aged 78 -- fasted for eight hours, from 10 a.m. through
6 p.m. -- at the event held at the National Taiwan University Sports Center,
according to the organizers.</P>
      <P>To date, 27,430 people in Taiwan have voluntarily experienced hunger from 12 to
30 hours in total, either in groups or as individuals, World Vision said in a
statement.</P>
      <P>"People living in Taiwan are among the lucky ones who do not know famine, while
other people in the world do not enjoy normal life due to war, disaster or
poverty, " Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin said at the event, describing the
participants as courageous in their willingness to experience others' misery and
pain.</P>
      <P>To encourage the fasters, singers and celebrities performed and shared their
experiences of traveling to Afghanistan, Sudan and China's Sichuan Province,
recently devastated by an 8-magnitude earthquake, the organizers said.</P>
      <P>The participants were also asked to discuss in groups possible solutions to the
worldwide food crisis.</P>
      <P>Through the fast, World Vision was hoping to raise NT$150 million to help
children and families suffering from famine,  natural disasters and war, the
statement said.</P>
      <P>According to the World Vision, about 1 billion people in the world are suffering
a food crisis, while famine and malnutrition kill about 25,000 children every
day.</P>

      <P>State Public Prosecutor-General Chen Tsung-ming demanded a probe Saturday into
why information concerning possible money-laundering by members of the former
first family did not reach him earlier.</P>
      <P>Chen made the demand amid media reports that the Ministry of Justice
Investigation Bureau (MJIB) received information from the Cayman Islands about
possible money-laundering by former President Chen Shui-bian's son Chen Chih-
chung and his wife Huang Jui-ching early this year.</P>
      <P>The MJIB's Money Laundering Prevention Center obtained the information
concerning  Chen Chih-chung  and Huang Jui-ching's remittances to overseas
accounts and money transfers for setting up a company as long ago as Jan. 28,
according to media reports.</P>
      <P>The center reported  to then-MJIB  Director  Yeh Sheng-mao immediately, and Yeh
reportedly said that he would hand over the information directly to Chen Tsung-
ming, the reports said.</P>
      <P>However, Chen Tsung-ming said he never received such information, prompting him
to order the probe into "who withheld the information."</P>
      <P>The probe into the suspected money-laundering involving the former first family
only came after the Ministry of Foreign Affairs confirmed Thursday that the
Swiss authorities had requested judicial assistance from Taiwan in a probe into
a suspected money laundering case in Switzerland involving Chen Chih-chung and

      <P>The ex-president admitted Thursday that he did not faithfully account for his

    <TEXT>
      <P>Former President Chen Shui-bian's campaign funding scandal should not have a
lethal impact on the future of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP), the party's chairwoman predicted Saturday.</P>
      <P>Tsai Ing-wen made the optimistic forecast at a DPP fundraiser in the central
Taiwan city of Taichung, in which the party smoothly raised NT$5 million to help
solve its financial woes. All of the NT$10,000-per-head tickets for the 50-table
dinner were sold out.</P>
      <P>"The sold-out dinner was an encouraging sign that Chen's election campaign fund
incident should not have a grave impact on our party, " Tsai told fundraiser
event goers.</P>
      <P>Following resounding defeats in the Jan. 12 legislative elections and the March
22 presidential poll, the DPP is now in its most difficult time, Tsai said,
adding that the exposure of campaign funding scandal involving former President
Chen, who was a DPP founding member and twice served as its chairman, adds up to
the party's woes.</P>
      <P>"We are lucky as our rank-and-file members and grassroots supporters have not
backed away from us at this critical moment, " an emotional Tsai said. "Our
rank-and-file members remain firm and determined in pursuing our party's cause."</P>
      <P>Noting that the DPP is obliged to provide alternative policy initiatives to
local voters, Tsaid said the DPP should not let its supporters and rank-and-file
members down and should strive to live up to their expectations.</P>
      <P>In regard to Chen's recent confession that he didn't faithfully account for his
campaign expenses in the two mayoral and two presidential elections between 1993
and 2004 and that he didn't know until early this year that his wife Wu Shu-jen
had wired a portion of surplus campaign contributions abroad, Tsai said the DPP
should make an overall review of its supervisory system.</P>
      <P>"A-bian (Chen's nickname) led our party to power. During the eight years in
power, we placed too much trust in his authority and power while giving up our
own thinking and judgment. As a result, his personal mistake now becomes our
party's crisis. It's not A-bian's own duty. Every DPP member should shoulder the
blame," Tsai said.</P>
      <P>Admitting that the DPP has not fulfill its supervisory duty, Tsai said she was
moved by the warmth and support shown by rank-and-file members and grassroots
supporters at this difficult time.</P>
      <P>"All party staff should never forget their generosity and should turn our
gratitude into strength to serve our people and country, " Tsai said.</P>
      <P>Tsai, who had served as vice premier and as the country's top China policy
planner under Chen's administration, promised that the DPP will beef up its
democratic decision-making mechanism to ensure that its policy decision reflects
the whole party's common will and consensus.</P>
      <P>In the face of domestic economic downturn and the impact of Chen's campaign
funding scandal, Tsai said the DPP may have hard time raising funds to finance
its development projects and campaign operations for next year's local
government chiefs elections.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Tsai said the party will not be daunted by such challenges as she
believes that voters' support and expectations, not money, will determine the
electoral outcome.</P>
      <P>"We should give the public a DPP that i renewed and worthy of expectations," she
added.</P>
      <P>As to Chen and his wife's decision to withdraw from the DPP and Chen's desire to
shoulder his responsibility for his actions as well as to accept an
investigation  by the party's anti-corruption committee, Tsai said the party
respect it and accept it.</P>
      <P>Stressing that anti-corruption and Taiwan-centric values are the DPP's only
assets, Tsai said the DPP will start over and face all difficulties, protect
Taiwan's sovereignty and democracy and continue to fulfill its role of
supervising the Kuomintang government.</P>
      <P>In the investigation of Chen's case, Tsai said the DPP will not be biased or
cover anything up. "The DPP will support the courts, " she said, adding that
Chen has the right and must offer the public a clearer explanation of the
incident.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou, who is in the Dominican Republic to attend the
inauguration of President Leonel Fernandez, demonstrated diplomatic skills by
interacting with some of the heads of state at the event.</P>
      <P>Ma, who was accompanied by Foreign Minister Francisco H.L. Ou and National
Security Council Secretary-General Su Chi, arrived 10 minutes earlier at the
Parliament where the ceremony was held. He was escorted to his seat area to be
placed between El Salvador President Antonio Saca on the right and Chilean
President Michelle Bachelet on the left.</P>
      <P>Given the fact that the official attire of the Dominican Republic is white, all
heads of state attending the ceremony were dressed in white suit with black tie
and shoes.</P>
      <P>Prior to his departure from the hotel to the inauguration venue, Ma replied a
reporters question on whether he is comfortable wearing the white suit, saying
thatSi (yes).</P>
      <P>This is my second time wearing white suit but I am quite comfortable in it,he
added.</P>
      <P>Ma, who sat at the second seat of the first row, exchanged greetings with
Haitian President Rene Preval and Honduras President Manuel Zelaya upon arrival,
who came to the Caribbean country by taking Mas charter flight from Paraguay
after attending the inauguration of Paraguayan President Fernando Lugo.</P>
      <P>The inauguration commenced with the singing of the national anthem of the
Dominican Republic in Spanish.</P>
      <P>Fernandez began his inauguration speech by thanking the 14 heads of state
present for attending the ceremony. Ma was the second to be named by Fernandez,
who addressed him ashis Excellency of the Republic of China Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The new government will achieve a new economy situation, while will be more
stable,he pledged in the speech.</P>
      <P>Facing mounting pressure to steer the Dominican Republic clear of a deep
economic slump threatening much of the Caribbean, analysts say Fernandezs deft
handling of the economy, and his ability to pull it out of the sever crisis he
inherited in 2004, were key to the victory of the New York-raised lawyer and
academic in his re-election in May, according to a Reuters report.</P>
      <P>But Fernandez has since been coping with fallout from the stumbling U.S. economy
and high global oil and food prices.</P>
      <P>Fernandez was sworn in for a third term in office on Saturday, a date also
coincides with the celebration of the Restoration of the nations independence.</P>
      <P>Other heads of state who have confirmed their attendance are Alvaro Uribe of
Colombia, Oscar Arias of Costa Rica, Martin Torrijos of Panama, Spanish Crown
Prince Felipe de Borbon and Prime Minister Dean Barrow of Belize.</P>
      <P>However, the presence of Venezuelan leader Hugo Chavez was prevented due to the
poor weather of a tropical storm, according to the countrys ambassador Francisco
Belisario Landis on Saturday morning.</P>
      <P>Ma, who is in his first state visit to South America and the Caribbean,  will
attend the religious ceremony of Fernandezs inauguration at 1: 00 p.m. local
time and hold bilateral talks with Saca.</P>
      <P>He will leave the Dominican Republic on Sunday and is scheduled to return to
Taiwan on Aug. 19.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Ex-president barred from leaving Taiwan over fund scandal</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  16 (CNA)
08/17/08  04:00:37
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former President Chen Shui-bian has been prohibited from leaving the country
after he was found to have a large sum of cash deposited abroad, a Supreme
Prosecutors Office (SPO) prosecutor said late Saturday.</P>
      <P>Chu Chao-liang, one of the three prosecutors who searched Chen's home and office
in Taipei earlier that day for evidence in connection with his suspected role in
a public fund embezzlement case, said Chen's overseas travel ban was issued
after extensive discussions among prosecutors at the SPO's Special Investigation
Task Force.</P>
      <P>"The main reason is that Chen has US$21 million deposited at overseas bank
accounts owned by his family members," Chu explained.</P>
      <P>Chen's wife, Wu Shu-jen, was charged with corruption and forgery in November
2006 for using receipts provided by others to claim reimbursements  totaling
NT$14.8 million (US$472,843)  from the president's "state affairs fund" between
July 2002 and March 2006.</P>
      <P>Chen, who was named as a co-defendant in the case but enjoyed immunity from
prosecution while in office, began to be questioned shortly after he stepped
down from the presidency May 20.</P>
      <P>He has not yet been indicted over the "state affairs fund" case, but prosecutors
decided to impose an overseas travel ban on him after he admitted Thursday that
he lied about the campaign expenses for his two mayoral elections and two
presidential elections between 1993 and 2004 and that his wife had wired surplus
campaign contributions to overseas bank accounts.</P>
      <P>Chen's confession came only after the Ministry of Foreign Affairs confirmed
earlier that same day that Swiss authorities have sought Taiwan's help in a
probe into a possible money laundering case in Switzerland involving Chen's son
Chen Chih-chung and daughter-in-law Huang Jui-ching.</P>
      <P>Chu and his two colleagues searched Chen's home and office and questioned the
former first couple Saturday to look into whether there were any links between
the "state affairs fund" misuse case and the suspected money-laundering case.</P>
      <P>According to Chu's three-member team, Saturday's operations were fruitful.</P>
      <P>It was found that Chen had a total of four undisclosed bank accounts to receive
political contributions for the 2000 and 2004 presidential elections -- three
for the 2000 election and one for the 2004 election, the team said in a
statement.</P>
      <P>All of the four accounts were opened in Chen's name, but their cash flows were
handled by his wife, according to the team.</P>
      <P>It further revealed that the total sum of inbound and outbound cash flows
involving the four accounts reached several hundreds of millions of New Taiwan
dollars and that many inbound remittances were worth NT$10 million each. During
the 2004 presidential campaign, Chen's secret account received a remittance of
NT$50 million in cash. Prosecutors said they are tracking the source of the
fund.</P>
      <P>Initial investigations of all of Chen's bank accounts opened for his two
legislative elections,  two mayoral elections and two presidential elections
also found that Wu Shu-jen had not only used her own bank account but also often
used the accounts of her husband, son, daughter, son-in-law and daughter-in-law
as well as her elder brother Wu Ching-mao for money transfers. Prosecutors said
they will summon all of them for questioning to clarify the purposes of the
money transactions.</P>
      <P>Moreover, prosecutors said Wu Ching-mao might be the former first couple's
figurehead in cross-border money transfers.</P>
      <P>Chou  Wen-hsiang,  a prosecutor  from the Tainan  District Prosecutors Office,
searched Wu Ching-mao's home in Tainan County's Matou township in southern
Taiwan Saturday for three hours and seized a collection of documents and data,
including a computer, for further analysis.</P>
      <P>As Wu Ching-mao was not at home Saturday, Chu's team said it will summon him
Monday for questioning.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chu said his team questioned the former first couple at their Taipei
home mainly because of Wu Shu-jen's health. According to Chu, Wu's condition is
not suitable for formal interrogations at the moment.</P>
      <P>Wu has been paralyzed from waist down and confined to a wheelchair since she was
hit by a truck in 1985. She attended only the first court hearing of the "state
affairs fund" misuse case and has since failed to appear in court to answer the
charges on grounds of ill-health.</P>

    <HEADLINE>President Ma attends inauguration of Dominican president</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Santo Domingo,  Aug. 16 (CNA)

(By Rachel Chan)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou, who is in the Dominican Republic to attend the
inauguration of President Leonel Fernandez, demonstrated diplomatic skills by
interacting with some of the heads of state at the event.</P>
      <P>Ma, who was accompanied by Foreign Minister Francisco H.L. Ou and National
Security Council Secretary-General Su Chi, arrived 10 minutes earlier at the
Parliament where the ceremony was held. He was escorted to his seat area to be
placed between El Salvador President Antonio Saca on the right and Chilean
President Michelle Bachelet on the left.</P>
      <P>Given the fact that the official attire of the Dominican Republic is white, all
heads of state attending the ceremony were dressed in white suit with black tie
and shoes.</P>
      <P>Prior to his departure from the hotel to the inauguration venue, Ma replied a
reporters question on whether he is comfortable wearing the white suit, saying
thatSi (yes).</P>
      <P>This is my second time wearing white suit but I am quite comfortable in it,he
added.</P>
      <P>Ma, who sat at the second seat of the first row, exchanged greetings with
Haitian President Rene Preval and Honduras President Manuel Zelaya upon arrival,
who came to the Caribbean country by taking Mas charter flight from Paraguay
after attending the inauguration of Paraguayan President Fernando Lugo.</P>
      <P>The inauguration commenced with the singing of the national anthem of the
Dominican Republic in Spanish.</P>
      <P>Fernandez began his inauguration speech by thanking the 14 heads of state
present for attending the ceremony. Ma was the second to be named by Fernandez,
who addressed him ashis Excellency of the Republic of China Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The new government will achieve a new economy situation, while will be more
stable,he pledged in the speech.</P>
      <P>Facing mounting pressure to steer the Dominican Republic clear of a deep
economic slump threatening much of the Caribbean, analysts say Fernandezs deft
handling of the economy, and his ability to pull it out of the sever crisis he
inherited in 2004, were key to the victory of the New York-raised lawyer and
academic in his re-election in May, according to a Reuters report.</P>
      <P>But Fernandez has since been coping with fallout from the stumbling U.S. economy
and high global oil and food prices.</P>
      <P>Fernandez was sworn in for a third term in office on Saturday, a date also
coincides with the celebration of the Restoration of the nations independence.</P>
      <P>Other heads of state who have confirmed their attendance are Alvaro Uribe of
Colombia, Oscar Arias of Costa Rica, Martin Torrijos of Panama, Spanish Crown
Prince Felipe de Borbon and Prime Minister Dean Barrow of Belize.</P>
      <P>However, the presence of Venezuelan leader Hugo Chavez was prevented due to the
poor weather of a tropical storm, according to the countrys ambassador Francisco
Belisario Landis on Saturday morning.</P>
      <P>Ma, who is in his first state visit to South America and the Caribbean,  will
attend the religious ceremony of Fernandezs inauguration at 1: 00 p.m. local
time and hold bilateral talks with Saca.</P>
      <P>He will leave the Dominican Republic on Sunday and is scheduled to return to
Taiwan on Aug. 19.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan should accelerate deregulation of laws: top economic planner</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Aug.  17  (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan should accelerate moves to deregulate many of the rules and polices that
have dragged down the country's  international  competitiveness,  the  head  of
the Cabinet-level Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) said
Sunday.</P>
      <P>CEPD Chairman Chen Tain-jy said the council might suggest the establishment of
an independent agency to be exclusively responsible for deregulation of laws and
policies to help raise Taiwan's competitiveness on the global economic and trade
fronts.</P>
      <P>Speaking to the media for the first time since he returned to Taiwan from a
ministerial meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum held
in Australia recently, Chen said there are many laws and regulations that must
be relaxed or liberalized in order to meet the needs of the public and private
sectors in terms of efficient growth and sustainable development.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan is lagging far behind in deregulation  efforts in comparison with other
major economies in the Asia-Pacific region, " he said.</P>
      <P>"Delegates of more than 20 nations have devoted their talks during the meeting
to deregulation of business and trade laws, " he added.</P>
      <P>Of the APEC economies, he said, Australia began the earliest -- in 1993 -- to
deregulate laws so that barriers could be removed to raise its international
marketing competitiveness.</P>
      <P>South Korea followed in 1998, relaxing business and trade restrictions and
removing barrier regulations, Chen continued.</P>
      <P>In South Korea, an independent agency exists immediately under the prime
minister's  office to be in charge of deregulating irrational or outdated laws
and mapping out new ones, he noted.</P>
      <P>According to the CEPD, Cabinet-level agencies in this country have put forth 67
items waiting to be deregulated by the end of this year, while 142 other
deregulation issues are expected to be discussed next year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taipei city, county guard against dengue fever outbreak</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 17 (CNA)
08/17/08  16:00:00
(By Y.L. Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The health agencies of the Taipei city and county governments are carrying on
preventive measures against dengue fever following the confirmation of two
recent indigenous cases in the Shilin district of the northern city.</P>
      <P>In addition, three other dengue cases have been reported in the same district,
said city government official Chen Cheng-cheng Sunday.</P>
      <P>The city government has dispatched staff to implement indoor and outdoor
mosquito insecticide spraying in areas within 200 meters of buildings with
dengue fever cases, while conducting outdoor spraying in 10 boroughs near the
areas, to reduce the numbers of mosquitoes in the district.</P>
      <P>The two confirmed cases involve two residents of Shilin, while the other three
involve people who had visited the district, according to Chen.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Taipei county government also ordered insecticide spraying in
Jenyi, Jenchung, Wufu and Fukuei boroughs in Sanchung City, which are adjacent
to Shilin district, although the Breteau index of dengue vector mosquito density
there was zero.</P>
      <P>The Breteau index, defined as the number of positive water containers for
mosquito larvae, is a relatively sensitive indicator of transmission.</P>
      <P>Chen added that health officials in the greater Taipei area have also been
conducting an investigation into mosquito larvae breeding in the district and
nearby boroughs in an effort to monitor and control the mosquito-born disease.</P>
      <P>Dengue fever is transmitted to humans by infected Aedes albo pictus mosquito
larvae, which mainly breed in containers holding stagnant water.</P>
      <P>Chen urged residents in the greater Taipei area to strengthen efforts in
cleaning up environmental black spots and eliminating standing water in water
storage containers, such as flower pots, water buckets and discarded tires, to
prevent mosquitoes from breeding.</P>
      <P>He also reminded those who develop early symptoms of dengue fever, such as
fever, joint pain and skin rash, to immediately seek medical treatment.</P>
      <P>As part of efforts to prevent an outbreak of dengue fever, Taipei City residents
who have received notification are required to open their doors so that cleaning
personnel can spray insecticide inside their homes. Those who refuse will face
fines ranging from NT$60,000 (US$1,950) to NT$300,000, Chen added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Bicycle craze leads to calls for greater cyclists' rights, safety</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>08/17/08  16:02:13</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>At an Aug. 2 bicycling event in Kaohsiung, Bai Yue, in his 20s, explained one
important benefit he'd received from the activity: a new girlfriend. Bai met the
young woman, Tzi Lin, through a folding bike blog, and they began going on dates
together to biking events.</P>
      <P>Now, the two are a couple. Both attended the Kaohsiung event, where more than
5,000 people turned out to tour two new bicycle paths.</P>
      <P>Bai and Lin are among an estimated 600,000 bicycling enthusiasts nationwide,
nearly double the 330,000 in 2006, according to a recent report released by the
Council for Economic Planning and Development. Bicycle sales have shot up, as
Taiwanese flock to enjoy the health and recreation benefits of the sport.</P>
      <P>The fad has gotten a further boost with skyrocketing fuel prices, which have
made bicycles an attractive, cheaper option to traveling by car or scooter.</P>
      <P>Now, with Taiwan's love affair with the bicycle in full bloom, cities and
counties are scrambling to meet cyclists' demands for more racks, bike paths and
dedicated lanes on city streets. But cyclists say more needs to be done --
especially in the area of safety -- to make Taiwan a truly bicycle-friendly
nation.</P>
      <P>Asked in a survey conducted by Chinese Cultural University earlier in the year,
cyclists cite bicycles being a "symbol of freedom, " helping conserve energy,
reducing pollution and the number of cars on the road, and staying physically
fit.</P>
      <P>The growing popularity of recreational cycling can be seen in the many bicycle
tour events in the past few months -- such as Kaohsiung's folding bike event in
May -- which now attract hundreds or even thousands of people.</P>
      <P>A survey released by the Taipei City government earlier this month showed that
the number of city residents who rode bikes increased to 10.5 percent of the
population in July, up from 6 percent in May. The city expects that if fuel
prices increase another 30 percent, ridership will further rise to 16.5 percent.</P>
      <P>Capitalizing on the current bicycle fad, Taiwan's Giant Inc, the world's largest
Taiwan-based bicycle manufacturer, sold 140,000 bikes in Taiwan in the first
half of the year, 40% more than in the same period last year.</P>
      <P>The company's revenue for the first half of this year soared 60 percent to NT$1
billion (US$32 million) , according to company spokeswoman Irene Chen.</P>
      <P>She said that Giant expects the number of cyclists to continue growing, hitting
some 700,000 by the end of the year.</P>
      <P>Governments are trying to keep up with the challenges presented by surging
number of bicyclists demanding better facilities and rights. The central
government announced Aug. 7 a plan to add more dedicated lanes alongside major
city streets nationwide to better meet cyclists' needs.</P>
      <P>In the pilot phase, the central government plans to add dedicated bicycle lanes
to Taipei's Dunhua Road. According to the plan, the lanes will be two to 2.5
meters wide and separated from motor vehicle lanes by flexible plastic pylons.</P>
      <P>The next stage of the plan will see Kaohsiung and Taichung cities add bicycle
lanes to other major city thoroughfares.</P>
      <P>The plan has already sparked complaints from motorcyclists, who already dodge
cars, trucks and buses in heavy traffic on roads like Dunhua Road.</P>
      <P>Chen Chin-pi, a white-collar employee, at the age of 45, who commutes daily by
scooter from Zhonghe to his office in downtown Taipei, said there are more
motorcyclists than bicyclists in Taiwan, and that the government should protect
motorcyclists' rights, too.</P>
      <P>Chen suggested that the government develop more bike routes rather than adding
bike paths, which will take away space from already-crowded traffic lanes.</P>
      <P>The controversial bike-lane plan comes after local governments have already
added hundreds of kilometers of new bicycle trails, and thousands of new bicycle
racks.</P>
      <P>By the end of 2007, the central government had built 40 dedicated bicycle paths
totalling more than 1,180 kilometers. It hopes to build a total of 2,600
kilometers of paths by 2011.</P>
      <P>Taipei City and Taipei county now have more than 500 kilometers of dedicated
bike paths. Taipei city provides 16,000 racks for parking bicycles, including
1,100 double-decker racks outside MRT stations. The city hopes to add bike
parking with lockers to further help cyclists.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung City, the second largest city in Taiwan, now has more than 100
kilometers of bike trails, and hopes to have a total of 180 kilometers built the
opening of the World Games in Kaohsiung next summer.</P>
      <P>With the cycling boom has come increased concerns about more accidents.</P>
      <P>According to a survey commissioned by the Department of Health, every years sees
an average of 3,700 injuries from cyclists, with 3 percent to 5 percent of them
fatal.</P>
      <P>It's not yet clear how much mishaps are on the rise with the nationwide fad, but
Tainan City statistics showed bicycle accidents in the southern city spiking
24.4 percent in the first half of this year as compared with the same period of
last year.</P>
      <P>The health department survey showed that the main cause of accidents was cyclist
error, chiefly not yielding right-of-way to motorists or disobeying other
traffic rules. Poor road design and bad visibility at night were also cited as
main causes.</P>
      <P>To keep accident numbers down, cyclists suggested in a recent interview with CNA
that the government should create more dedicated bike lanes, as it already plans
in Taipei, Kaohsiung and Taichung.</P>
      <P>David Reid, in his 30s, a cycling enthusiast and Taipei County resident, said
that there are plenty of recreational bicycle paths outside city centers, but
that doesn't solve the problems many city commuters face.</P>
      <P>He said the government should enact policies to reduce cars on the road, but did
not give details.</P>
      <P>However, Chang Ming-yuan, a 42-year-old cyclist and jouranlist covering
transportation issues, said the goal could be reached by pushing forward car
sharing schemes -share a ride with a colleague at work or rotate with other
parents on school runs-- or designating a national car-free day.</P>
      <P>Some cyclists also suggested that the government require all bicycles sold in
Taiwan to meet higher safety requirements -- for example, by requiring that all
bicycles have both front and rear reflectors.</P>
      <P>They also advised the government to better enforce traffic rules and promote
awareness of proper road use among cyclists.</P>
      <P>For example, all cyclists are supposed to ride the same direction as traffic,
and use hand signals to indicate when they are slowing, stopping or turning.</P>
      <P>Cyclists also emphasized that all riders should wear helmets, to prevent
sometimes  fatal head injuries resulting  from bicycle accidents.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan, Dominican Republic to work on FTA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Santo Domingo, Aug. 16 (CNA)

(By Rachel Chan)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou and Dominican Republic President Leonel Fernandez agreed
Saturday that the two countries will begin to push for the signing of a free
trade agreement (FTA) to consolidate bilateral economic exchanges.</P>
      <P>In a reception with the media during his first state visit to the Dominican
Republic to attend the inauguration of President Leonel Fernandez, Ma said he
suggested that the two sides sign an FTA as soon as possible,  noting that
concrete results were observed immediately after Taiwan' s singing of FTAs with
El Salvador and Honduras.</P>
      <P>"I also proposed that Taiwan and the Dominican Republic should hold an annual
economic cooperation seminar, " Ma said, adding that such a mechanism will not
only expand economic relations but also better monitor bilateral cooperation.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has FTAs with only five developing countries -- Honduras, El Salvador,
Nicaragua, Panama and Guatemala -- all of which are the country's diplomatic
allies.</P>
      <P>Fernandez said that his country not only want to develop diplomatic relations
with Taiwan but also to strengthen bilateral economic and investment relations.</P>
      <P>"We don't want to always be the country receiving aid but hope to develop our
trade relations (with other countries)," he was quoted as saying by Presidential
Office spokesman Wang Yu-chi.</P>
      <P>Describing the talks between Ma and Fernandez as "in-depth," Wang told reporters
that the two also discussed Ma's proposal of a "diplomatic truce" with China.</P>
      <P>He said Fernandez made very "insightful observations" regarding the issue,
saying that he "understands" such change given the fact that cross-Taiwan Strait
relations are different from what they used to be.</P>
      <P>The frosty relations between Taiwan and China have been thawing since Ma took
office May 20, with his proposal of a "diplomatic truce" aimed at terminating
the longstanding diplomatic tug-of-war with China in which both countries try to
lure each other's allies into switching diplomatic allegiance by offering large
sums of money in foreign aid to developing countries.</P>
      <P>Ma also touted the strategy of "modus vivendi" or "pragmatic diplomacy" aimed at
leveraging more international space for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Prior to the meeting with Fernandez, Ma also held bilateral talks with El
Salvador President Antonio Saca and Haitian President Rene Preval.</P>
      <P>During those meetings, Ma and Saca discussed Taiwan's bids to participate in
international organizations, as well as bilateral economic exchanges.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan's (U.N. membership) bid this time is more low-profile and I believe the
results will be better," Ma said.</P>
      <P>In response, Saca pledged to support Taiwan's bid.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's proposal this year, emphasizing the importance of the country's
"meaningful participation" in U.N. specialized agencies, was submitted to the
U.N. Secretariat Aug. 15 by representatives of St. Vincent and the Grenadines
and the Solomon Islands, two diplomatic allies of the Republic of China, at the
request of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</P>
      <P>The proposal marks a fresh approach by the government in pushing for greater
participation in international organizations for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The previous DPP administration applied in 2007 to join the U.N. as a full
member under the name Taiwan, the first time it had tried under that name.
However, that proposal failed to make the agenda of the U.N. General Assembly,
just as the previous ones since 1993 also failed.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Saturday in the Dominican Republic that he feels
sorry about a scandal in which ex-president Chen Shui-bian is accused of
depositing large sums of cash in overseas bank accounts, as it is disgraceful
and reminds people of Ferdinand Marcos, the corrupt ex-president-dictator of the
Philippines.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks in a reception with the media during his first state visit
to South America and the Caribbean to attend the inaugurations of Paraguayan
President Fernando Lugo Aug. 15 and Dominican Republic Leonel Fernandez Aug. 16.</P>
      <P>Noting that both Haitian President Rene Preval and Spanish Crown Prince Felipe
de Borbon asked him about the scandal, Ma said he was too ashamed to talk about
it.</P>
      <P>"It is difficult to talk about the incident because it is so disgraceful, " he
said, adding that "it reminds people of the former president of the Philippines,
Ferdinand Marcos."</P>
      <P>Marcos, who served as president of the Philippines from 1965 to 1986, was forced
out of office in 1986 in a massive nonviolent protest known as the People Power
Movement. His authoritarian regime is remembered for its rampant corruption at
the highest levels of government.</P>
      <P>Chen admitted Thursday that he lied about the campaign expenses for his two
mayoral elections and two presidential elections between 1993 and 2004 and that
his wife wired surplus campaign contributions into overseas bank accounts.</P>
      <P>Chen's confession came only after the Ministry of Foreign Affairs confirmed
earlier that same day that the Swiss authorities have sought Taiwan's help in a
probe into a possible money laundering case in  Switzerland  involving  Chen's
son  Chen  Chih-chung  and daughter-in-law Huang Jui-ching.</P>
      <P>The former president claimed that his wife Wu Shu-jen made the transactions
without his knowledge.</P>
      <P>Wu was charged with corruption and forgery in November 2006 for using receipts
provided by others to claim reimbursements totaling NT$14.8 million (US$472,843)
from the president's "state affairs fund" between July 2002 and March 2006.</P>
      <P>Chen, who was named as a co-defendant in the case but enjoyed immunity from
prosecution while in office, began to be questioned shortly after he stepped
down from the presidency May 20 but has not yet been indicted.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors who searched Chen's home and office in Taipei earlier Saturday for
evidence in connection with the case, said Chen has been prohibited from leaving
the country.</P>
      <P>Asked if the government should have had taken action against Chen Chih-chung
given the fact that he is also involved in the case but has already left the
country, Ma said he did not think that anyone had the right to prohibit him from
leaving the country at that time.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou was given the keys Saturday to the city of Santo Domingo
-- the capital of the Dominican Republic -- after attending the inauguration of
Dominican President Leonel Fernandez earlier that day.</P>
      <P>The ceremony commenced with the singing of the national anthems of both the
Republic of China and the Dominican Republic.</P>
      <P>After receiving the keys from Roberto Salcedo, mayor of Santo Domingo, Ma
expressed his gratitude in Spanish, saying that he was glad to come to the
Caribbean country but was sorry that he had only learned Spanish for four hours
so could not speak much of the language.</P>
      <P>"I hope President Ma will never have to use the keys, as the door of Santo
Domingo is always open to him and the people of the ROC, " Salcedo said.</P>
      <P>Noting that he also conferred city keys to various heads of state when he was
Taipei mayor from 1998 to 2006, Ma said this is the first time he has received
the honor from another mayor.</P>
      <P>The president said he used to tell the recipients of the Taipei City keys that
they can get 20 percent discount at any department store in Taipei as long as
they bring the ceremonial key with them and asked Salcedo if he would get the
same treatment.</P>
      <P>Salcedo replied that he can have a 15 percent discount, a statement that drew

    <TEXT>
      <P>A former chief of the Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau (MJIB) admitted
his failure Saturday to convey information about suspected money laundering
involving members of the former first family to the prosecution before his
retirement.</P>
      <P>Yeh Sheng-mao confessed to his mistake amid media reports that the MJIB's Money
Laundering Prevention Center received information from the Cayman Islands in
late January that former President Chen Shui-bian's daughter-in-law Huang Jui-
ching had a bank account there, probably for money laundering purposes. The
local prosecution, however, was not informed of the intelligence until recently
by the Ministry of Justice (MOJ).</P>
      <P>Yeh, who retired from the top MJIB post after the inauguration of the Kuomintang
government in May, confirmed in a written statement that he did not deliver any
formal documents concerning the sensitive information to the prosecution before
his retirement because of what he claimed was his "personal negligence."</P>
      <P>But he argued  that  he verbally  informed  State  Public Prosecutor-General
Chen Tsung-ming of the intelligence in a meeting in early February.</P>
      <P>"At the time, Chen Tsung-ming said that if no concrete evidence was available,
the MJIB could deal with it on its own. Therefore, I did not pass the formal
document to him," Yeh said in the statement.</P>
      <P>In the ensuing months, Yeh recalled that the issue was shelved because of the
approach of the March 22 presidential election.</P>
      <P>After the election, in which the former president's Democratic Progressive Party
suffered a resounding defeat, Yeh said he was preoccupied with retirement
formalities and thus did not bother to address the issue.</P>
      <P>Claiming that he directed the Money Laundering Prevention Center to maintain
contact with the source of the intelligence, Yeh said the issue was not tackled
before his retirement, partly because no further information had been received
from the Cayman Islands source.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Yeh denied allegations that he leaked the information to the former
first family and insisted that he kept the information confidential and did not
expose it to anybody else.</P>
      <P>Yeh also apologized to the public, the MOJ and MJIB staff and Chen Tsung-ming
for his "personal negligence" in handling the matter.</P>
      <P>Responding to Yeh's argument, Chen Tsung-ming denied that he had ever been
briefed by Yeh on the sensitive information and he urged Yeh to face up to his
own mistake squarely.</P>
      <P>The prosecution did not get the information until after Swiss authorities
recently sought Taiwan's help in a probe into another possible money laundering
case in Switzerland involving the former president's son Chen Chih-chung and his
wife Huang Jui-ching, both of whom left Taiwan Aug. 9, probably for the United
States.</P>
      <P>The suspected  money  laundering  case adds to the former president's legal
woes, as he is already battling charges that he misused public funds.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors have barred Chen Shui-bian from leaving the country pending further
investigations into his suspected roles in the "state affairs fund" embezzlement
case and the alleged money laundering case.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  prosecutors  investigating  the suspected  money laundering case
said they will summon Yeh for questioning later this month to determine whether
he breached any laws by failing to pass on the confidential  information  from
the Cayman Islands to the prosecution in a timely manner.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Saturday in the Dominican Republic that his proposal
of a "diplomatic truce" with China does not mean that the government is trying
to work on a "dual recognition" system.</P>
      <P>"I'm not trying to work out `dual recognition, '" Ma said, adding that a
"diplomatic truce would be aimed at giving a clear direction" to Taiwan's
allies."</P>
      <P>Due to the political differences and division between the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait, China refuses to allow countries to maintain diplomatic ties with
both Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks during a reception with the media during his first state
visit to South America and the Caribbean to attend the inaugurations of
Paraguayan President Fernando Lugo Aug. 15 and Dominican Republic President
Leonel Fernandez Aug. 16.</P>

relations with the country's allies.</P>
      <P>"There are a lot of people suffering in the world. We have to help them, as that
is our responsibility, rather than conducting checkbook diplomacy, " the
president said, adding that as long as Taiwan's foreign aid programs have
"legitimate objectives, the granting procedures  are in accordance  with the law
and the implementation is effective and efficient."</P>
      <P>Asked about his thoughts on his eight-day trip as it approached its end, Ma said
that he was "deeply moved" to see both Lugo and Fernandez talk about anti-
corruption and bring change to their countries, statements that he said sound
like his own words.</P>
      <P>"These leaders are very keen to do something and we would like to help, " Ma
said. "Seeing their ambition, I also want to offer my sincere blessings to

      <P>China launched a counterattack in the second inning. After getting to first base

bunt. Another hit by Sun Li sent her to home base to score for a 1-1 tie.</P>
      <P>Chinese Taipei scored another run in the fourth inning, leading the game 2-1,
after strong hitter Chiang made first base with a hit and then made it to home
base when teammate Lu Hsueh-mei followed with another hit. Neither team scored
more runs thereafter.</P>
      <P>Chinese Taipei used Wu Chia-yen as starting pitcher, who was relieved by Chueh

of funneling large sums of cash into Swiss bank accounts.</P>
      <P>"I think they were lacking in alertness, " Ou said, adding that "incidents of

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Supreme Prosecutors Office (SPO) decided Sunday to track the sources of a
large sum of cash deposited abroad by former President Chen Shui-bian and his
family.</P>
      <P>Members of the SPO Special Investigation Division searched Chen's residence and
office the day before and questioned Chen and his wife, Wu Shu-jen, on money
laundering allegations and their roles in a public fund embezzlement case.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors were told by Wu during the questioning that US$21 million
deposited in the family's overseas bank accounts was all legal income, including
the balance of campaign funds from Chen's two mayoral races and his two
presidential campaigns, his income as a lawyer prior to the 1980s, and her own
dowry.</P>
      <P>Wu said that for the convenience of investing overseas, she asked her elder
brother, Wu Ching-mao, and her daughter-in-law, Huang Jui-ching, to open bank
accounts in Singapore and Switzerland to facilitate the liquidity of their
money.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors  believe  that the sums deposited  in the Singaporean and Swiss
bank accounts are much larger than the "state affairs fund" that Chen possibly
embezzled as president between 2000-2008.</P>
      <P>They suspect that the deposits could be bribes that the first couple received
from the "second financial reform" drive that was launched during Chen's tenure,
in which a number of private banking institutions became major financial
operations after merging with publicly run ones.</P>
      <P>The deposits could also be bribes that the first couple received from a spate of
personnel arrangements and shifts during Chen's tenure, particularly the change
of chairmen of major state-run or state-controlled enterprises, according to one
of the prosecutors.</P>
      <P>"So long as the money was remitted abroad from Taiwan, all the funds' travel
routes and who remitted the money can be traced via the international anti-money
laundering Egmond Group,  even if the remittances were made via offshore banking
accounts, " the prosecutor went on.</P>
      <P>Chen's wife was charged with corruption and forgery in November 2006 for using
receipts provided by others to claim reimbursements totaling NT$14.8 million
(US$472,843) from the president's "state affairs fund" between July 2002 and
March 2006.</P>
      <P>Chen, who was named as a co-defendant in the case but enjoyed immunity from
prosecution while in office, began to be questioned shortly after he stepped
down from the presidency May 20.</P>
      <P>Chen has not yet been indicted over the "state affairs fund" case, but
prosecutors decided to impose an overseas travel ban on him after he admitted
Aug. 14 that he lied about the campaign expenses for his two mayoral elections
and two presidential elections and that his wife had wired surplus campaign
contributions to overseas bank accounts.</P>
      <P>Prosecutor Ching Chi-jen left for Switzerland Aug. 15 to review the accounts
under the name of Chen's daughter-in-law at Merrill Lynch Bank after the Federal
Department of Justice and Police of the Swiss Confederation requested assistance
from Taiwan in a case of suspected money laundering by Chen's son, Chen Chih-
chung and his wife Huang Jui-ching, through two Swiss bank accounts.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors also searched Wu Ching-mao's home in Tainan, southern Taiwan
Saturday and barred him from leaving the country.</P>
      <P>The SPO Special Investigation Division planned to send Ching to Singapore  in
late August to help probe the money laundering allegations.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chen Chih-chung and Huang Jui-ching left for the United States Aug.
9, taking their baby daughter and Huang's mother with them.</P>
      <P>Huang's mother boarded a flight from New York with the baby Saturday to return
to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>At the airport, the mother told reporters that Chen Chih-chung will return to
Taiwan next week to answer prosecutors' questions. He is currently enrolling at

      <P>A former head of the Investigation Bureau under the Ministry of Justice is
facing investigation over his alleged concealment of information about suspected
money laundering by former President Chen Shui-bian and his family.</P>
      <P>Minister of Justice Wang Ching-feng told reporters Sunday that she had presented
all related information for the Taipei Public Prosecutors Office to investigate
whether former Investigation Bureau Director Yeh Sheng-mao should be prosecuted.</P>
      <P>The issue arose last week as new evidence emerged about the former president and
his wife using their daughter-in-law to transfer large amounts of money through
two Swiss bank accounts.</P>
      <P>Chou Yu-yi,  director of the Investigation  Bureau's Money Laundering Prevention
Center, confirmed that he had transferred intelligence from the Cayman Islands,
located in the Western Caribbean, about a bank account held by a firm set up by
the former president's son Chen Chih-chung and daughter-in-law Huang Jui-ching.</P>
      <P>According to Chou, although he reminded Yeh repeatedly about the vital
information, Yeh did nothing.</P>
      <P>Yeh issued a statement late Saturday in which he admitted that he had  failed
to  send  the  written  information  to  State Prosecutor-General Chen Tsung-
ming, but claimed that he had made an oral report to Chen -- a claim that the
prosecutor-general strongly denied.</P>
      <P>If Yeh is found by the court to have concealed the vital information, he could
face five years in prison.</P>

      <P>A prosecutor who traveled to Lausanne, Switzerland  Aug.  12 to render Taiwan's
assistance  to Swiss prosecutors in their investigation of suspicious money
laundering involved former President Chen Shui-bian returned to Taipei Sunday
night.</P>
      <P>Ching Chi-jen, a leading prosecutor from the Taiwan District Prosecutors Office,
told journalists on her return to the Taoyuan International Airport that she has
brought some documents to her Swiss counterparts.</P>
      <P>She refused to reveal what documents she had passed over to Swiss prosecutors
Edmond Ottinger and Luc Leimgruber saying only that it included an indictment
against former first lady Wu Shui-jen on the charge of corruption and forgery.</P>
      <P>Wu was charged in November 2006 for using receipts provided by others to claim
reimbursements totaling NT$14.8 million (US$472,843) from the president's "state
affairs fund" between July 2002 and March 2006.</P>

authorities the information they had gathered in their investigation into the
funds stashed in the two accounts opened by Chen's daughter-in-law Huang Jui-
ching with the Merrill Lynch Bank in Geneva.</P>
      <P>The prosecutor said her Swiss counterparts responded to her request
"positively", but she didn't elaborate on it.</P>
      <P>Ching said she hoped a regular judicial assistance system could be set up
between Taipei and Swiss through their cooperation in probing the case.</P>
      <P>Ching also said she had requested the Swiss authorities to hand the funds in
Huang's bank accounts, reported to be about US$21 million, to Taiwan authorities
if they are the illegal gains of Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>Chen admitted on Aug. 14 that his wife had wired abroad an unspecified amount of
money that he has received as campaign contributions during his four races for
public offices.</P>
      <P>He claimed the wire transfer were made without his knowledge, and he learned of
it only early this year.</P>
      <P>Chen made the statement hours after a legislator claimed that Swiss  prosecutors
Ottinger  and Leimgruber  had asked Taiwan authorities to help verify the origin
of a huge amount of funds in Huang Jui-ching's bank accounts.</P>
      <P>Chen's announcement added to his legal woes, as he is already battling charges
that he colluded with his wife in misusing the "state affairs fund."</P>
      <P>The prosecution in Taiwan is looking into the allegation that Chen and his wife

      <P>Seventy percent of patients suffering from hair loss wait for up to one year and
spend an average of NT$7,500 (US$246) before seeking treatment, a dermatologist
said Monday.</P>
      <P>Dermatologist Huang Yao-li of Chang Kung Memorial Hospital cited figures
compiled by the Taiwan Dermatological Association, which surveyed 328 patients
this year suffering from hair loss.</P>
      <P>Huang said that he has seen some young outpatients in their 20s and 30s
suffering from hair loss, adding that he knows of three patients who spent
around NT$100,000 trying without success to save their hair.</P>
      <P>He explained that finding 40 or more strands of hair on the pillow in the
morning or losing 50 or more strands during a shampoo are signs of androgenetic
alopecia, or male pattern baldness, which he said requires treatment.</P>
      <P>He urged people who are bothered by hair loss to see a doctor to determine the
cause of the problem.</P>
      <P>If the hair loss is due to stress, delaying treatment could result in complete
baldness, he warned. If the problem is male pattern baldness, then long-term
treatment would be required while the patient is still young, he added.</P>
      <P>People who experience hair loss for more than three months should seek
treatment, which should start to produce visible results after six months, he
suggested.</P>

      <P>Meanwhile, Huang said, the Justice Ministry will seek to broaden cross-border
judicial cooperation with foreign nations, including Switzerland, Singapore and
the United States, given that Chen and his wife Wu Shu-jen deposited large sums
of cash abroad under the names of their family members.</P>
      <P>Wu said last week during questioning at her residence by prosecutors that the
US$21 million deposited in the family's various overseas bank accounts was "all
legal income."  The money is distributed in three accounts -- two in Switzerland
held in the names of Chen's daughter-in-law Huang Jui-ching and one in Singapore
in the name of Wu's brother Wu Ching-mao.</P>
      <P>The Justice Ministry is offering a reward of NT$10 million to persons who
provide information leading to a break in the case related to the money-
laundering allegations against the former first family, Huang said.</P>
      <P>The MOJ also urged companies, organizations or individuals who were involved in
the alleged money laundering operations to take a moral stance and come forward
to help solve the case.</P>
      <P>Chen's wife Wu Shu-jen was charged with corruption and forgery in November 2006
for using receipts provided by others to claim reimbursements  totaling NT$14.8
million (US$472,843)  from the president's "state affairs fund" between July
2002 and March 2006. Chen, who was named as a co-defendant in the "state affairs
fund" case but enjoyed immunity from prosecution while in office, came under
questioning shortly after he stepped down from the presidency May 20.</P>
      <P>Chen has not been indicted in the "state affairs fund" case, but prosecutors
imposed an overseas travel ban on him after he admitted Aug. 14 that he lied
about the campaign expenses for his two mayoral elections and two presidential
elections and that his wife had transferred surplus campaign contributions to
overseas bank accounts.</P>
      <P>Prosecutor Ching Chi-jen left for Switzerland Aug. 15 to review the accounts
under the name of Chen's daughter-in-law at Merrill Lynch Bank after the Federal
Department of Justice and Police of the Swiss Confederation requested assistance
from Taiwan in a case of suspected money laundering by Chen's son and his
daughter-in-law, through two Swiss bank accounts.</P>
      <P>Taiwan prosecutors searched Chen and Wu's home over the weekend.</P>

    <HEADLINE>'Instant care' program benefiting needy households launched</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A program offering cash subsidies as "instant care" for households close to the
poverty line but otherwise ineligible for government assistance was launched
Monday.</P>
      <P>The program, initiated by the Ministry of the Interior (MOI), is designed to
benefit households whose main breadwinners are dead or unaccounted for or who
have been jobless due to severe injury or other reasons in recent years, MOI
officials said.</P>
      <P>Under the program, about 96,000 households involving 290,000 people  nationwide
are expected  to benefit  to the tune of NT$10,000-NT$30,000 per family per
month from the temporary cash subsidies that are part of the government's
efforts to help the disadvantaged cope with inflation triggered by surging oil
and commodity prices, according to the officials.</P>
      <P>MOI officials said initial funds for the program have already been appropriated
to local government offices.</P>
      <P>In emergency cases, local offices are encouraged to first deliver NT$5,000 to
the households most in need until such time as they can formally apply for the
subsidies, the officials went on.</P>
      <P>According  to MOI tallies,  of the 7.6 million households nationwide, the 10
percent at the bottom of the income distribution graph are most in need of
government aid.</P>
      <P>While 90,000 of these households are classified as low-income families and are
already receiving various subsidies from the government, those who are "close to
the poverty line" are not given any assistance.</P>

      <P>The Taiwan integrated circuit (IC) industry's production reached NT$359.6
billion (US$11.45 billion) for the second quarter of this year, marking an
increase of 4.9 percent over the previous quarter, the Industry and Technology
Intelligence Services (ITIS) said Monday.</P>
      <P>Lee Pei-yin, an analyst at the ITIS, said the primer mover behind the growth was
the IC design industry, which saw its preferential market share continue to
increase and its production rise by 5.3 percent to NT$96.5 billion for the
quarter.</P>
      <P>This was followed by the IC testing industry, which experienced growth in
production of 4.9 percent to hit NT$25.7 billion, the IC manufacturing industry,
up 4.8 percent to NT$178.4 billion, and IC packaging, increasing 4.4 percent to
reach NT$59 billion.</P>
      <P>IC makers serving the notebook computer industry did not perform as well, as the
second quarter is traditionally a slow one for laptop makers, according to Lee.</P>
      <P>Lee said the ITIS has forecast that the Taiwan IC industry's production will
grow by 14.3 percent in the third quarter to reach NT$411 billion, with IC
design leading the way once again with expected growth of a whopping 25.4
percent to hit NT$121 billion.</P>

      <P>The Chinese Taipei baseball team's Olympic medal hopes officially came to a
heartbreaking end in Beijing Monday with a 9-8 loss to South Korea in what
almost turned into a miracle comeback by the Taiwanese squad.</P>
      <P>The South Korean side came out slugging in the top of the first, knocking
Chinese Taipei starter Yang Chien-fu around for five hits and seven runs to take
a seemingly insurmountable lead.</P>
      <P>Ni Fu-te came in at the start of the second to replace the shell-shocked Yang,
giving up one run before settling down to keep the Koreans scoreless for the
next five innings and give his teammates a chance to mount a comeback.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan sluggers responded, picking up a pair of runs in the second before
lighting up Korean starter Bong Jungkeun for four runs in the fifth to close the
gap to 8-6.</P>
      <P>In the sixth, Taiwan was able to put runners on first and second base with only
one out on a pair of bases on balls, setting the stage for clean-up hitter Peng
Cheng-min's two-run double to tie up the score.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, the Chinese Taipei squad hardly had time to celebrate before the
Koreans struck back at the top of the next inning, with Lee Daeho advancing to
first on a bases on balls and Lee Jinyoung hitting a single before Kang Minho's
RBI single with none out to give Korea a 9-8 lead.</P>
      <P>Chinese Taipei saw a glimmer of hope with Lin Chih-sheng's lead-off double to
start the bottom of the seventh, but their hopes were quickly dashed with three
straight strike outs by the Korean hurlers to close out the inning.</P>
      <P>The Koreans were able to hang on to the lead for the rest of the way,  handing
Chinese Taipei its fourth straight loss of the tournament and ending its hopes
of advancing to the semi-finals and a chance at Olympic gold.</P>
      <P>All that is left now for the Chinese Taipei side is to redeem itself and gain

      <P>A majority of office workers in Taiwan are keeping a close eye on the Beijing
Olympics, with some of them even changing their work schedules or skipping work
altogether to watch the events on TV, a local online poll revealed Monday.</P>
      <P>Seventy-three percent of local office workers surveyed Aug. 8-15 by the 1111 Job
Bank, a major online human resource agency, said they are "very interested" in
or paying close attention to the Olympics, the poll indicated.</P>
      <P>According to the poll, 16.53 percent of the 73 percent said that they have
changed their work schedules to watch the games.</P>
      <P>In the same category, 46.07 percent said they have changed their work time or
shifts, 16.29 percent said they have taken days off, 15.73 percent said they
arrive late for work, 14.04 percent said they leave work early, while 8.43
percent skip work altogether.</P>
      <P>Even those who have not changed their schedules also admitted that they are
affected at work because of the games, the poll shows.</P>
      <P>The poll adds that 22.33 percent  said they peek at the competitions or scores
while working, 14.53 percent said they are eager to get off work, while 11.93
percent said they often discuss the competitions, affecting their productivity.</P>
      <P>1111 Job Bank spokesman Ryan Wu urged local companies to tolerate their
employees' enthusiasm about the Olympics as long as company operations are not
affected.</P>
      <P>"Such tolerance will help companies win the support of their employees," Wu
said, suggesting that companies use the opportunity to increase employee morale
and esprit de corps.</P>
      <P>However, he also urged employees not to let their passion for the Olympics
undermine their performance.</P>
      <P>The poll shows that 25.16 percent of the respondents interested in the Olympics
said their companies have adopted open policies toward their employees in this
regard.</P>
      <P>These policies include allowing employees to watch events on TV at company
restaurants or in the office, informing employees as results come in, letting
employees get off work early to watch important competitions, or offering leave.</P>
      <P>The top five popular sports among local office workers, who were allowed to make
multiple choices, are baseball (76.51 percent) , taekwondo (36.12 percent),
tennis (22.93 percent), basketball (21.73 percent) and water sports (19.87
percent), the poll indicates.</P>
      <P>When the athletes or teams that they support lose, 78.3 percent said they felt
"slightly disappointed, " while 7.26 percent disclosed that their great
disappointments have affected their work.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has taken two bronze medals in weightlifting so far. Its baseball  team
defeated the Netherlands  in the first Olympic competition but then went on to
lose to Japan, China, Cuba and South Korea.</P>
      <P>The poll had 1,115 valid samples, with a margin of error of 2.9 percent and a 95
percent level of confidence.</P>

      <P>Investments totalling an all-time high of NT$40.4 billion (US$1.29 billion) were
channeled into the export processing zones across Taiwan in the first seven
months of this year, the Export Processing Zone Administration under the
Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) reported Monday.</P>
      <P>During the January-July period, NT$23.5 billion worth of capital from 49 new
investment plans was injected into nationwide export processing zones, while
some NT$16.9 billion came from increased capital by another 54 companies which
are already operating in these zones, statistics compiled by the administration
showed.</P>
      <P>The combined figure of NT$40.4 billion has surpassed  the full-year target of
NT$37 billion set by the MOEA for 2008, and is the highest investment sum ever
recorded in the zones for the January-July period, administration officials
noted.</P>
      <P>The officials predicted that more than NT$50 billion worth of capital will be
invested in the export processing zones throughout the country for the whole of

      <P>The  officials  attributed  the  strong  showing  to  the administration's

    <HEADLINE>MOJ probes concealment in ex-president's money-laundering case</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 18 (CNA)
08/18/08  18:15:10

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Justice (MOJ) has asked the Taipei District Prosecutors Office
to help investigate the alleged concealment of information by officials
regarding suspected money laundering by the former first family, Deputy Minister
of Justice Huang Shih-ming said Monday.</P>
      <P>The official determined to be responsible  for withholding intelligence  passed
on to Taiwan  by the Egmont Group,  an international anti-money laundering
organization, can be charged with obstruction of official duties under the
Criminal Code, Huang said.</P>
      <P>At issue is an Egmont Group report received in January by the Investigation
Bureau's Money Laundering Prevention Center, which detailed  the status of bank
accounts  created by members of then-President Shui-bian's family in other
countries, including the United States, Cayman Islands, Singapore and
Switzerland.</P>
      <P>However, the prosecutorial authorities were unaware of the information until
Next magazine, citing the contents of the report, reported last week that Chen's
daughter-in-law Huang Jui-ching had laundered money for the former first family
by secretly wiring NT$300 million overseas in 2006, after the exposure of the
"state affairs fund" embezzlement case implicating Chen and his wife Wu Shu-jen.
The revelation was based on tips leaked to the magazine by investigators.</P>
      <P>Over the weekend,  Yeh Sheng-mao,  a former  head of the Investigation Bureau
who retired from the post after the inauguration of the Kuomintang government in
May, admitted that he did not deliver any formal documents concerning the
sensitive information to the prosecution before his retirement because of what
he claimed was his "personal negligence."</P>
      <P>Yeh claimed that he made an oral report to State Public Prosecutor-General Chen
Tsung-ming in early February -- a claim that the prosecutor-general strongly
denied.</P>
      <P>According to Huang, the case was assigned to the Taipei District Prosecutors
Office, instead of the special investigation unit of the Supreme Prosecutors
Office headed by Chen Tsung-ming, so as to avoid a conflict of interests.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors can summon the state public prosecutor-general for questioning if
necessary, Huang added.</P>
      <P>Also Monday, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said it was investigating
whether officials of the country's representative office in Switzerland were
responsible for delaying the delivery to Taipei of a letter from the Swiss
Confederation's Department of Justice in which the Swiss authorities sought
Taiwan's assistance in probing possible money-laundering in Switzerland by Chen
Shui-bian's son Chen Chih-chung and Huang Jui-ching.</P>
      <P>The letter, dated June 16, was received by the representative office in early
July, but staffers there allegedly sat on it for nearly a month before
forwarding it in late July to the MOFA, which later transferred it to the MOJ.</P>
      <P>Ruling Kuomintang Legislator Hung Hsiu-chu revealed last Thursday that the Swiss
authorities had put forth the request for assistance, one day after the release
of the Next magazine report.</P>
      <P>Hung's revelation prompted the former president to call a news conference that
same day in which he admitted that his wife had wired abroad an unspecified
amount of money that he had received as campaign contributions.</P>
      <P>Chen confessed that he lied about the election campaign expenses for his two
mayoral elections and two presidential elections between 1993 and 2004, but
claimed he was unaware that the surplus funds were wired abroad by his wife
until early this year.</P>
      <P>However, he rejected Hung's allegation that the funds wired overseas could be
connected to his "state affairs funds" case and a recent scandal involving a
botched attempt to win Papua New Guinea as a diplomatic ally.</P>

park in Taichung County for a fare of NT$500 (about US$16), but later requested
an additional fare after they got on the freeway, the students complained in a
petition letter to a local newspaper.</P>
      <P>The students recalled that after getting out of the taxi, they had to carry
their luggage and walk for more than 10 minutes to get off the freeway to find
other transportation.</P>
      <P>At a city meeting, Taichung City Police Chief Yeh Kun-fu said that the police
are currently looking for the driver by going through the city's surveillance
camera footage because the students did not write down the taxi's vehicle
number.</P>
      <P>Noting that the driver has violated the Social Order Maintenance Act, Taichung
Mayor Jason Hu said at the meeting that relevant agencies should study ways to
prevent recurrence of similar events.</P>
      <P>"Taichung City government requires that local taxis charge according to meters,
otherwise passengers should file a complaint with the city government by
offering the taxi number, " said Chen Rui-chen, an acting section chief in the
city's Department of Transportation.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A former Republic of China representative to Switzerland described Monday the
core idea of Taiwan's renewed U.N. bid as being "too thoughtless" because "it is
meaningless" to let Beijing decide whether or not to allow Taiwan to join the
United Nations.</P>
      <P>Wang Shih-rong, who stepped down from the post in February after serving in the
European country for nearly six years, made the criticism at a seminar on
Taiwan's U.N. bid and foreign relations, organized by the Taipei-based Taiwan
Thinktank -- a nonprofit public policy research organization.</P>
      <P>Last week, President Ma Ying-jeou announced a policy under which Taiwan will
call for the U.N. to consider the feasibility of "meaningful participation" in
U.N. activities by Taiwan.</P>
      <P>It marks a fresh approach by the government in seeking U.N. admission for Taiwan
since 1993, when it began efforts to re-enter the U.N. after losing its seat to
the People's Republic of China in 1971.</P>
      <P>The latest proposal does not mention the country's attempt to enter the U.N.
under the name Taiwan, nor does it mention the Republic of China seeking to
return to the U.N.</P>
      <P>According to Wang, his experience in fighting for Taiwan's space in the
international community during his tenure as the country's top representative in
Switzerland tell him that so-called meaningful participation is meaningless
because Beijing will still be the key element in the U.N. as far as Taiwan's
U.N. bids go.</P>
      <P>"How could the government put the country's future in the hands of China while
believing that China will treat Taiwan well? " Wang asked.  Beijing claims
sovereign over Taiwan and vows war if self-ruled Taiwan declares formal
independence.</P>
      <P>The previous Democratic Progressive Party administration for the first time in
2007 applied to join the U.N. as a full member under the name Taiwan, a proposal
that did not make the agenda of the U.N. General Assembly.</P>
      <P>The 63rd regular session of the U.N. General Assembly is slated to open Sept. 16
at U.N. Headquarters in New York.</P>
      <P>Ma's proposal emphasizing the importance of Taiwan's "meaningful participation"
in the U.N. has been submitted to the U.N. Secretariat by representatives of St.
Vincent and Grenadines and the Solomon Islands, two of the country's 23
diplomatic allies.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>An environmental impact assessment panel deferred a decision on a plan by the
state-run Taiwan Water Corp. to expand a desalination plant in outlying Penghu
County, one of Taiwan's driest regions, and asked the company to provide a more
detailed plan and agenda for stopping the use of underground water before
approving the plan.</P>
      <P>In order to convert more seawater to drinking water, the Taiwan Water Corp. is
planning to expand an existing seawater desalination plant capacity to 13,000
cubic meters per day (CMD) from the present 8,500 CMD.</P>
      <P>At present, the main water demand in the Makung area -- the most populous area
of the Penghu archipelago -- is about 22,500 CMD. So far, with three reservoirs
and an underground water supply, the water company can only just meet the
demand, Wang Ming-yuan, representative of the corporation's public works
department, said Monday after an environmental impact assessment meeting.</P>
      <P>"But we are under pressure to supply more fresh water in the near future, " said
another corporation worker, who added that the construction of six tourist
hotels in the island county is expected to be completed this year, leading to an
inevitable increase in demand.</P>
      <P>However, the environmental impact assessment panel held off its decision and
asked the company to provide a more detailed plan for stopping the use of
underground water -- a condition to which the water company agreed when the
original plant construction plan was given a green light -- as excessive pumping
can lead to land subsidence, while lowering the underground water level can lead
to salinization of the supply.</P>
      <P>"We gave conditional approval to the original plan for the desalination plant on
condition that the company would stop pumping underground water, and the company
must not violate that condition, " said a member of the assessment committee at
the meeting, adding that the underground water level is nearly 100 meters below
ground.</P>
      <P>In addition, in order to stabilize the desalinated water quality, it has been
suggested that the underground water be mixed with desalinated water, the water
company said.</P>
      <P>About 6,000 CMD of underground water is consumed in the Makung area every day,
according to the company.</P>
      <P>The panel is committed to making a decision at its next meeting, but only after
an on-site investigation and the submission of detailed plans by the water
company.</P>
      <P>The annual average rainfall in Penghu County is 1,000 mm, with an average 95
days of rain per year and an evapotranspiration level of as high as 1,600 mm per
year due to strong wind and long hours of sunshine, according to the Penghu
county government.</P>
      <P>The central government began constructing seawater desalination plants in the
outlying islands, including Penghu and Kinmen, in 1995.</P>

      <P>Ruling Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Wu Po-hsiung called Monday for eternal peace
across the Taiwan Strait, as he presided over a ceremony on the outlying Kinmen
Island in commemoration of the soldiers who died in the service of their country
during the Artillery Bombardment on Aug. 23, 1958.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan and China should seize the opportunity brought about by Taiwan's
transfer of power in May to catch up with international trends of peace,
friendship and progress, and to mend their rifts and make peace across the
Taiwan Strait," Wu said.</P>
      <P>Wu made the comments at a news conference held at the 823 Artillery War Museum
on Kinmen, where he laid wreathes to pay his respects to the memory of the local
residents and soldiers who died in fierce bombardments by Chinese communists 50
years ago.</P>
      <P>Asserting that the KMT is committed to building peace and creating mutual
benefits across the strait, the KMT chairman said that the two sides stand a
good chance of moving towards that goal by "putting aside disputes" and "forging
goodwill."</P>
      <P>Wu, who attended the Aug. 8 opening of the Beijing Olympics at China's
invitation, said the Chinese people should have learned more about the true
meaning of peace, friendship and progress from the Games.</P>
      <P>Wu expressed the hope that through two-way efforts, war would not erupt again
between the two sides of the strait.</P>
      <P>Accompanied by eight retired military generals and ranking KMT officials,  Wu
flew  to Kinmen  Island  in the morning.  The Taiwan-controlled island lies
closer to China than to Taiwan proper.</P>
      <P>After the commemoration ceremony, Wu visited a temple on Taiwu Mountain and
prayed for cross-strait peace.</P>
      <P>The KMT chief also visited in the afternoon a memorial hall dedicated to the
late President Chiang Ching-kuo, who also once served as KMT chairman.</P>

      <P>Former President Chen Shui-bian's daughter Chen Hsing-yu claimed Monday that
over the years, her father used the funds he mustered to help the election
campaigns of many Democratic Progressive Party heavyweights, and she dared them
to say that they were all clean about how the funds were used.</P>
      <P>Chen Hsing-yu, a dentist, was on her way to work when she was beset by a group
of reporters seeking to question her about her father's suspected money
laundering through two Swiss bank accounts owned by his daughter-in-law, Huang
Jui-ching.</P>
      <P>Last week, the former president admitted that his wife had wired US$20 million
in surplus funds from campaign contributions to his two mayoral  elections  and
two presidential  elections  into  his daughter-in-law's Swiss bank accounts.</P>
      <P>An irate Chen Hsing-yu described the investigation into the former president's
suspected money laundering as a "political struggle."</P>
      <P>"Who among the Kuomintang and Democratic Progressive Party politicians dare say
that they have filed honest reports about the surplus funds from their election
campaign contributions?" she asked.</P>
      <P>"Those DPP members who received election subsidies from my father, did they file
reports honestly about those funds? Or did they report their surplus funds
honestly?" she continued.</P>
      <P>She specifically cited former Premier Su Tseng-chang, former Premier Frank Hsieh
and Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu as among those DPP members who had received
financial assistance from her father during their election campaigns.</P>
      <P>Later in the day, Su's staff responded by saying that Su had never received any
donations from Chen Shui-bian, although he was grateful for the former president
stumping for him during several election campaigns.</P>
      <P>Hsieh's office also issued a statement saying that it was a natural thing among
party members to help one another seek financial contributions during election
campaigns.</P>
      <P>"However, regarding the latest presidential election, Frank Hsieh did not
receive any donations from Chen Shui-bian," the statement said.</P>
      <P>Interviewed by TV reporters, Chen Chu said the real issue is not about how Chen
Shui-bian obtained the campaign contributions but about why his surplus funds
were wired abroad.</P>

      <P>The Taipei city government presented a subsidy program Monday to help phase out
two-stroke motorcycles more than seven years old in order to reduce air
pollution in the northern Taiwan metropolis.</P>
      <P>The city government's Department of Environmental Protection said in a news
release that it will give a cash subsidy of NT$1,500 to each of the first 5,000
owners of such motorcycles who agree to turn in their old vehicles to licensed
factories for recycling by the end of this year.</P>
      <P>City environmental officials said that Taipei at present has 1.07 million
motorcycles, of which 190,000 are two-stroke motorcycles over seven years old.</P>
      <P>"These two-stroke motorcycles generate up to five times more air pollution than
the four-stroke motorcycles of a similar age," according to an official who
added that is why the city government is using the subsidy program to encourage
their retirement.</P>
      <P>To qualify for a subsidy, a motorcycle must be registered in Taipei. Application

      <P>A total of 38 forums will be held around the Penghu Islands this autumn to tap

government said Monday.</P>
      <P>The forums, scheduled to be held between Aug. 26 and Sept. 22 in places around
Penghu, including the rural islets of Jibei, Hujing and Niaoyu, are targeted at
consolidating a consensus of all Penghu residents on casino development in their
hometown, officials from the Penghu County Tourism Bureau said.</P>
      <P>Eight academics from National Penghu University and National Taiwan University

government and representatives of Penghu-based  travel agencies at the forums to
inform Penghu residents of the advantages and disadvantages of developing
tourist casino hotels in Penghu.</P>
      <P>The experts will also listen to the pros and cons of whether casinos should be
built on the island chain located off the southwest coast of Taiwan proper.</P>
      <P>The forums came soon after Premier Liu Chao-shiuan announced at a Cabinet

    <TEXT>
      <P>Tainan County in southern Taiwan has made progress in selling mangoes to Japan,
in terms of export volume, after years of effort in seeking better fruit quality
and effective promotion measures, Magistrate Su Huan-chih said Monday.</P>
      <P>The agricultural county is known for many types of agricultural produce, with
the Irwin mango being one of its specialty strains. The county is also Taiwan's
largest producer of mangoes.</P>
      <P>According to Su, Tainan County's export of mangoes to Japan has increased from
100 tons in 2001 to 1,000 tons last year, and the volume for this year already
surpassed 1,200 tons by the end of July.</P>
      <P>The performance was brought by great efforts made by local mango growers and the
county government.</P>
      <P>Su said the county practices a strict traceability system that requires each
exported mango carry a bar code representing its production origin and providing
a warranty from the farmers to win consumers' confidence.</P>
      <P>Moreover,  in order to meet the requirements  of advanced countries,  like
Japan,  that ask for strict  inspections  on agricultural products, the county
established vapor heat treatment facilities three years ago for insect
sterilization of mangoes and tightly controls pesticide use in its contract
mango orchards.</P>
      <P>Only mangoes that pass strict inspections are competitive in Japan's market, and
quality control, instead of quantity, which Taiwan has no problem at all
meeting, is the challenge that Taiwan faces in promoting its fruits in foreign
markets, Su said.</P>
      <P>The county has 540 hectares of contract orchards producing 6,000 tons yearly for
export, of which 30 percent can be shipped to Japan this year, Su said, adding
that each mango grower has to be careful about quality control because a single
bad sample would affect the whole image that the county has built.</P>
      <P>The county government established the Tainan Agriculture Trading Co. four years
ago to professionally promote the county's farm produce domestically and
globally.</P>
      <P>Better quality control helps increase selling prices in Japan, and the practice
of the traceability system is expected to allow a mango to be sold at double its
previous price, Su said.</P>
      <P>However, he went on to say that Taiwan has great room for improvement.</P>
      <P>The best price for a mango of top quality produced in Taiwan is US$19 in Japan,
while a mango produced in Japan's Miyazaki Prefecture or in the Philippines can
be sold at US$90 and US$63, respectively, Su said.</P>
      <P>In addition, Taiwan exports 750 tons of Irwin mangoes to Japan every year, which
demands 10,000 tons of the same strain, while the Philippines is responsible for
exporting the rest of Japan's demand, Su said.</P>
      <P>He expressed hope of having the export quantity and selling price grow with
better approved quality.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's southern port city of Kaohsiung, which will host the 2009 World Games,
denied an allegation Monday that the city's air quality is the worst in the
entire country.</P>
      <P>The denial came after a United Daily News report said earlier in the day that
Kaohsiung City's Pollutant Standards Index (PSI) was 8.6 percent last year,
which is even worse than the 8 percent recorded in 2001.</P>
      <P>The report quoted statistics from the Environmental Protection Administration
(EPA) and wrote that the city's air quality has been the worst in Taiwan since
the government began monitoring air quality in cities and counties in 1994.</P>
      <P>The report noted that the EPA formulated a three-year plan to improve the air
quality in Kaohsiung City, Kaohsiung County and Pingtung County, all in southern
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The plan is aimed at lowering the PSI to 6.5 percent before the World Games
kicks off next year, but three years on, there has been no improvement in the
air quality, the report claimed.</P>
      <P>Chen Kai-ling, acting director of the city's Environmental Protection Bureau,
countered that the city's PSI dropped to 6.16 percent last year from 2006's 7.34
percent and 2005's 9.77 percent.</P>
      <P>The 8.6 percent cited in the news report refers to the overall air quality of
Kaohsiung City, Kaohsiung County and Pingtung County, not just that of Kaohsiung
City, Chen explained.</P>
      <P>Compared with Beijing, which is currently hosting the Olympic Games, Kaohsiung
City enjoys much better air quality, Chen pointed out.</P>
      <P>The Chinese authorities forced factories in Beijing to shut down operations and
barred scooters and motorcycles from entering Beijing as a temporary means of
solving the serious air pollution during the Olympics, he went on.</P>
      <P>Beijing's measures were seeking 250 "blue sky days" and according to Beijing's
standards, Kaohsiung City had at least 340 "blue sky days" last year, Chen
noted, adding that Kaohsiung City also uses a much stricter standard than the
one used by Beijing.</P>
      <P>The news report also quoted Lee Ken-cheng, executive director of the
environmental group Mercy on the Earth Taiwan, who blasted the government for
allowing local power plants and oil refineries to expand their operations in
recent years.</P>
      <P>Lee attributed the major sources of air pollution to Taiwan's state-run oil,
steel and electricity companies, which all have plants in the city.</P>
      <P>Chen, however, argued that the accusation is false and that the Kaohsiung city
government takes a firm stance on reducing pollution.</P>
      <P>For example, he noted, former Kaohsiung Deputy Mayor Chiu Tai-san recently
rejected a new round of an environmental impact assessment for a major power
plant expansion, effectively curtailing the expansion plan.</P>
      <P>At the time, an environmental assessment commissioner lauded the city government
for being committed to protecting the environment, Chen recalled.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung City has long had a poor environment because it is home to many heavy
industry plants, Chen said, adding that despite this, the city government has
been working to improve air quality over the years.</P>

organizers said Monday.</P>
      <P>Wu Shu-min,  chairman of the pro-independence group Taiwan Society, made the
announcement at a news conference.</P>
      <P>Wu said the demonstration will be held as slated to speak about their desires
for adequate government policies to take better care of their livelihoods.</P>
      <P>According to Wu, the demonstrators will ask the government, led by President Ma
Ying-jeou, to return taxes, stabilize consumer product prices, protect Taiwan's
independent sovereignty from China, build a clean and competent government and
enact key bills to ensure clean politics and wipe out official corruption.</P>
      <P>"The demonstration was projected to drive sustainable development in Taiwan's
democracy, freedom and the people's interests, " he said, "which has nothing to
do with the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) or the opposition Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP)."</P>
      <P>The money-laundering scandal embroiling Chen and his family is being
investigated by prosecutors, but many Taiwanese people are more concerned about
Ma's deeds and the government's policies, he claimed.</P>
      <P>"The Aug. 30 protest will be just the start of a series of similar activities to
speak out the people's anger against the 'misguided' government policies after
Ma came to power May 20, " he said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Society Secretary-General Lo Chih-cheng said the people who will take
part in the Aug. 30 march and rally made the decision to do so on their own and
were not being mobilized by Taiwan Society.</P>
      <P>Although Lo acknowledged that some of them, affected by Chen's scandal, have
decided to skip the Aug. 30 demonstration, he urged the public to
enthusiastically participate in the demonstration and ignore Chen's scandal.</P>
      <P>Two groups of demonstrators will march separately from the shopping area on
Zhongxiao East Road in eastern Taipei and from Lungshan Temple in western Taipei
before joining up for a rally on Ketagalan Boulevard in front of the
Presidential Office Building, where they will stage a string of protest
activities Aug.30.</P>

      <P>Two giant pandas that have been offered as a gift to Taiwan by the Chinese
government are healthy and living well at the Bifengxia Panda Base in Yaan City
in China's Sichuan Province, China's official Xinhua news agency reported
Monday.</P>
      <P>The two pandas were moved to Bifengxia after their old quarters -- the Wolong

"reunion" between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, have open grounds in which
to spend their time, as well as air-conditioned quarters in which they can cool
off, according to a researcher at the panda center.</P>
      <P>The pandas, which feed on five to six kg of bamboo, milk, apples and maize every

    <HEADLINE>Ex-president listed as suspect in alleged money laundering case</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  18 (CNA)
08/18/08  23:19:24

    <TEXT>
      <P>Former President Chen Shui-bian and his wife Wu Shu-jen have been listed as
suspects in a high-profile money laundering case and have been barred from
leaving the country, the Supreme Prosecutors Office (SPO) confirmed Monday.</P>
      <P>Other suspects are Wu's elder brother Wu Ching-mao, who has also been prohibited
from leaving, and Chen's son Chen Chih-chung and daughter-in-law Huang Jui-
ching, who have already left the country but should have their movements
reported should they ever return to Taiwan, according to Prosecutor Chu Chao-
liang, a member of the SPO's Special Investigation Division.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors questioning Wu Ching-mao that day found that he was instructed by
the former first lady to wire money into various overseas bank accounts, some of
which was transferred via an underground banking system.</P>
      <P>Wu Ching-mao confessed that he "began to handle Wu Shu-jen's money" via his bank
account in Singapore's ABN AMRO Bank when Chen Shui-bian served as Taipei mayor
between 1994 and 1998.</P>
      <P>If the money was remitted from Taiwan, it was through domestic banks, but
sometimes wired through an underground banking system, according to Wu Ching-
mao.</P>
      <P>The prosecution was surprised by Wu Ching-mao's statement, as Wu Shu-jen claimed
to prosecutors last Saturday during a search of her home that all overseas funds
came from the balance of Chen's campaign election expenses, his earnings as a
lawyer before entering politics, her dowry and her investment gains.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors questioned why she would have felt the need to use the
underground banking system if she was telling the truth and that all the money
really had been obtained legally.</P>
      <P>Chen Shui-bian admitted last Thursday that he did not faithfully report the
election campaign expenses from his two mayoral elections and two presidential
elections between 1993 and 2004, but claimed he was unaware that the balance of
the funds was wired abroad by his wife until early this year.</P>
      <P>He rejected the idea that the funds wired overseas could be connected to his
"state affairs fund" case and a recent scandal involving a botched attempt to
win Papua New Guinea as a diplomatic ally.</P>
      <P>A prosecutor said Monday he suspected the source of the money might be "more
complicated" than originally thought.</P>
      <P>Also that day, the prosecutors questioned Wu Ching-mao's wife Chen Chun-ying,
two assets managers, three bank clerks at ABN AMRO bank and China Steel Co.
Chairman Lin Wen-yuan, who is known to have played a key role in managing
campaign funds for the former president.</P>
      <P>All apart from Wu Ching-mao were named as witnesses in the case and all were
released after questioning.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the prosecutors questioned former Ministry of Justice Investigation
Bureau head Yeh Sheng-mao over alleged concealment of information regarding the
suspected money laundering.</P>
      <P>At issue is a report from the Egmont Group -- an international anti-money
laundering organization -- that the Investigation Bureau's Money Laundering
Prevention Center received in January, which details the status of bank accounts
created by Chen's family members in other countries, including the United
States, the Cayman Islands, Singapore and Switzerland.</P>
      <P>Yeh admitted that he did not deliver formal documents concerning the sensitive
information to State Public Prosecutor-General Chen Tsung-ming before his
retirement last month because of what he claimed was his "personal negligence"</P>
      <P>However, he claimed that he made an oral report to Chen Tsung-ming in early
February -- a claim that the prosecutor-general strongly denied.</P>
      <P>The SPO has listed Yeh as a person whose movements require monitoring and has
said that any Taiwan entries or departures must be immediately reported because
of his suspected concealment of information.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's Legislative Yuan Vice President Tseng Yung-chuan arrived in Bangkok
Sunday for a two-day visit at the head of a delegation of four ruling Kuomintang
legislators.</P>
      <P>During the visit, Tseng said, the delegation will meet with Thai lawmakers and
push them to help lobby the Thai government to support Taiwan's participation in
activities related to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).</P>
      <P>According to Tseng, the world's economy is moving toward a trend of integration,
such as the European Union and ASEAN. Taiwan should not be marginalized from
this process of economic integration, he said.</P>
      <P>Tseng noted that Taiwan has frequent trade dealings with ASEAN member states,
with the annual trade volume reaching US$60 billion. Taiwanese companies have
also invested more than US$53.85 billion, in 8,790 cases, in ASEAN countries,
according to Tseng.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan and ASEAN countries are not only neighbors but also close
business partners, Tseng said Taiwan should not be marginalized or exclude from
regional economic integration.</P>
      <P>According to Tseng, China, Japan and South Korea will join ASEAN as "ASEAN plus
one," "ASEAN plus two" and "ASEAN plus three" in 2010, 2011, and 2012,
respectively.</P>
      <P>"These countries will sign free trade agreements (FTAs) and benefit from reduced
tariffs, " Tseng said, adding that if Taiwan is marginalized from this economic
integration, it will be greatly affected.</P>
      <P>Tseng expressed  hope that Thai lawmakers  will assist in canvassing
administrative departments to consider Taiwan's proposal of becoming an ASEAN
dialogue partner at the next ASEAN summit.</P>
      <P>In the past, China has always interfered with Taiwan's bids to join
international organizations, said Tseng. Now that cross-Taiwan Strait relations
have thawed somewhat, Taiwan hopes to seek more chances of joining such
organizations, Tseng added.</P>
      <P>The four KMT legislators accompanying Tseng are Chu Fong-chi, Hung Hsiu-chu, Pan
Wei-kang and Chiu Ching-chun. After winding up their visit to Thailand, the
delegation will visit Indonesia, visiting not only Taiwanese businessmen  there
but also local lawmakers.</P>

      <P>According to the CEPD's draft estimate, such numbers will decline by 16 percent,
36 percent and 9 percent, respectively, 10 years from now, and the decrease
rates will even reach 22 percent, 37 percent and 38 percent, respectively 20
years later.</P>
      <P>In other words, the number of 18-year-olds will drop to 304,000 in 2018 and
further slide to 201,000 in 2028. If the trend continues, the number of college
freshmen could plunge to 125,000 by 2056, according to the CEPD estimate.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan to become aging society by 2017: CEPD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 19 (CNA)
08/19/08  13:41:08
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan is set to formally become an aging society in 2017, with the number of
people aged 65 years and older accounting for 14 percent of the population, a
Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Wang Ling, a CEPD section chief in charge of manpower planning, made the remarks
one day after the Cabinet-level council unveiled a report on the country's
projected demographic  development for 2008-2056.</P>
      <P>Quoting the report, Wang said Taiwan's population is aging far faster than in
many advanced countries.</P>
      <P>By the United Nations definition, Taiwan's population began graying in 1993 when
the ratio of elderly citizens reached 7 percent of the total population for the
first time.</P>
      <P>"It is taking just an estimated 24 years for Taiwan to turn from graying to
aging, compared to 50 to 100 years in advanced Western countries," Wang said.</P>
      <P>According to the CEPD's forecast, Taiwan will even become an "ultra-aging
society" by 2025 when those aged 65 and older will account for 20 percent of the
total population.</P>
      <P>With the population aging rapidly, Wang said, the country's aged dependency
ratio could surpass the youth dependency ratio for the first time in five years.</P>
      <P>The aged dependency ratio -- the number of actively working people divided by
the number of aged dependents -- is a common measure for gauging the burden of
an aging society.</P>
      <P>The 2008 statistics show that on average there are seven active workers
supporting one elderly person, according to the CEPD report. It forecasts that
by 2026, the ratio will drop to 3.2 workers per elderly citizen. It has also
predicted that the figure will drop further to 1.4 active workers for every
"aged dependent" in the society.</P>
      <P>The CEPD estimated that the ratio of citizens 65 and older will surge from this
year's 10.4 percent of the total population to 14.7 percent by 2018, and to 37.5
percent by 2056.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the number of "ultra old" persons -- over 75 years old -- will zoom
from this year's 1.03 million to 4.55 million by 2056, according to the CEPD.
The ratio of "ultra old" citizens to the elderly population -- aged 65 and older
-- is also forecast to increase from 43.1 percent to 59.7 percent over the same
period.</P>
      <P>While the elderly population continues to grow, the CEPD report notes, women's
total fertility rate has fallen below the replacement level.</P>
      <P>According to statistics compiled by the Ministry of the Interior (MOI), the
fertility rate dropped to 1.1 children per woman in 2007, from 1.77 a decade
ago.</P>
      <P>The contributing factors are late marriage and a declining marriage rate among
women in the childbearing age group, which have resulted in shorter effective
childbearing periods, MOI tallies show.</P>
      <P>According to the MOI's latest demographic report, the marriage rate among women
in the 35-39 age group declined from 82.6 percent in 1997 to 71.2 percent in
2007. During the same period, the average age of local women giving their birth
to their first child rose from 26.3 years to 28.5 years.</P>
      <P>In the face of growing the demographic imbalance, the CEPD, in its newly drafted
demographic report, has come up with various policy initiatives such as
encouraging marriage and childbearing and creating an environment favorable to
the formation of households.</P>
      <P>CEPD officials  said the major target  of the new policy initiatives is to
gradually raise the fertility rate -- which has remained at 1.1 per woman for
the past three years -- to 1.4.</P>
      <P>If that goal can be met, the officials said, the zero growth in Taiwan's
population will not occur until 2026 -- an eight-year delay compared to a
prediction made two years ago.</P>
      <P>It is also hoped that the current statistic of a 19 percent lifelong single
state among women 45-49 years old will drop to 18 percent.</P>
      <P>The latest CEPD report also forecast that Taiwan's population will peak at
23.837 million at the end of 2026, the officials said.</P>
      <P>Other measures proposed by the CEPD to tackle demographic imbalances also
include adjusting the allocation of educational resources  and upgrading  the
quality of education,  enhancing investment in human resources development,
appropriately recruiting talent from abroad, improving job market mechanisms,
offering better economic security to guarantee the lifestyle  of the elderly,
promoting "silver-hair" industry and care services, reinforcing counseling and
assistance to new immigrants and building a society that respects cultural
pluralism.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Kaohsiung says revised plan for MRT extension nearing completion</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  Aug.  19 (CNA)
08/19/08  14:36:47
(by Steve Bercic)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Kaohsiung municipal government's Mass Rapid Transit Bureau said Tuesday that
a revised plan for an extension of the southern port city's MRT lines is nearing
completion and will be submitted to the Ministry of Transportation  and
Communications (MOTC) next month for approval.</P>
      <P>If approved, the Kaohsiung MRT's Red Line and Orange Line will be extended by a
total of 23.4 kilometers, according to the bureau.</P>
      <P>Noting that the Red Line has already been in service for five months and that
the Orange Line is set to be launched next month, Lee Yeong-kuen, a division
chief at the bureau, said that as soon as both lines are up and running, the
Kaohsiung municipal government will help the Pingtung County and Kaohsiung
County government's push for the planned extension to create a comprehensive
mass transit system linking these southern Taiwan regions.</P>
      <P>The Red Line currently runs from Siagang Station in Kaohsiung City northward to
Gangshan Station in Kaohsiung County, covering 28.3 kilometers, while the Orange
Line will run 14.4 kilometers from Sizihwan Station in the city to Daliao
Station in the county.</P>
      <P>Lee said that because of calls by the Pingtung and Kaohsiung county governments,
the Kaohsiung municipal government drew up extension plans in 2006 and sent them
to the MOTC several times since then for approval.</P>
      <P>Each time, the MOTC called for revisions to the plan to address its concerns
that the extension might not be worth the investment as it would follow almost
the same path as the national railway which links Pingtung and Kaohsiung, and
would lead to a reduction in passengers numbers.</P>
      <P>The bureau has therefore made revisions, with the new plan calling for an
extension of the Red Line northward by 9.4 kilometers to the Luchu Science Park
in Kaohsiung County, and an extension of the Orange Line southward by 14.4
kilometers to the Pingtung sugar factory in the Pingtung City.</P>
      <P>Lee said that that the extensions would definitely lead to a significant
increase in MRT passenger numbers, adding that the only question now is whether
the benefits of the extensions will outweigh the massive investment needed to
make the plan a reality.</P>
      <P>The extension of the Red Line is expected to cost about NT$16.2 billion
(US$516.6 million), while the Orange Line extension has an estimated price tag
of NT$31.8 billion, according to Lee.</P>

      <P>A new round of cross-Taiwan Strait negotiations might resume after the Beijing
Olympics and conclude in late October or early November, with Taiwan and China
inking two agreements on setting up direct shipping links and cargo charter
flight services, a Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Kao Koong-lien, vice chairman and secretary-general of the semi-official SEF,
said the foundation has informed its Chinese counterpart -- the Beijing-based
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) -- of its idea of
re-opening planned two-way talks in Taiwan after the Olympics.</P>
      <P>"The two intermediary bodies are expected to re-open bilateral negotiations
after the Beijing Olympics and to wrap up the talks by late October or early
November," he said.</P>
      <P>Kao made the remarks to reporters on the sidelines of a forum on Taiwan's
prospects of becoming an "Asia-Pacific financial hub."</P>
      <P>Commenting on the possible negotiation topics in the coming round of bilateral
talks, he said the two sides agreed in June talks in Beijing to discuss adding
new destinations and new routes to the existing direct cross-Taiwan Strait
weekend charter flights, as well as the signing of two new accords on the
establishment of direct shipping and cargo charter flight services across the
strait.</P>
      <P>The SEF and ARATS clinched two historic deals in June agreeing to open direct
cross-strait passenger charter flights on weekends and to admit a larger number
of Chinese tourists to visit Taiwan from early July.</P>
      <P>As to the question of whether ARATS President Chen Yunlin will visit Taiwan and
make a round-the-island tour after the Olympics, Kao said only that "the SEF
will definitely perform its duties as a host."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A significant number of teenagers under the age of 16 have sought assistance via
the national teenage pregnancy counseling hotline or Web site over the past
year, indicating a trend in which teenage pregnancies are occurring at younger
ages, the non-profit Garden of Hope Foundation said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The civic group has since June 2008 been contracted by the Ministry of the
Interior to operate the 0800-257085 toll-free hotline and the www.257085.org.tw
Web site.</P>
      <P>Over the past year, 1,312 requests for help have been made through the hotline
and 141 others made through the online mailbox provided by the Web site, which
has seen 16,602 visitors so far, according to foundation CEO Chi Hui-jung.</P>
      <P>While more than 50 percent of callers were girls in the 16-19 age group, 10
percent were under 16, Chi said.</P>
      <P>In terms of those seeking help online, 30 percent were girls under 16, with more
than 10 under the age of 12, she said.</P>
      <P>Chi said her foundation discovered that the online service was especially
popular among teenagers wishing to maintain their privacy and that most
teenagers were turning to the hotline or Web site because they did not know how
to tell their parents.</P>
      <P>Also, there was a serious imbalance in terms of the gender of the persons
seeking assistance, Chi said.</P>
      <P>For example, 37.9 percent of the calls were made by girls, compared with only
8.6 percent by boys, she noted.</P>
      <P>While 61 percent of families calling the hotline were from the girls' side, just
9.2 percent were from the boys' side, she said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 76 percent of those asking for help online were girls, and only 13
percent were boys, she said.</P>
      <P>Chi urged the authorities to expand the reach of their publicity on teenage
pregnancy prevention to students in senior grades of elementary school and to
introduce legislation emphasizing the responsibility of men in teenage
pregnancy.</P>
      <P>Also, parents should pay close attention to their children's sexual development
and react rationally in the event of their teenage children getting pregnant,
she said.</P>
      <P>The foundation  has estimated  that the number of teenage pregnancies are likely
to total approximately 30,000 per year in Taiwan, with around 25,000 teenage
abortions and 4,000-5,000 births to teenagers recorded per year.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan has long played a key role in the global manufacturing supply chain and
has gained recognition for technological innovation, strong research and
development capability and outstanding high-tech products.</P>
      <P>Now, as the country establishes new links across the Taiwan Strait and relaxes
cross-strait regulations, Taiwan wants to be recognized in another light: as a
haven for investment and a center of operations for companies in the Asia-
Pacific region.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's booming investment opportunities will take center stage at the annual
"Taiwan Business Alliance Conference," to be held on October 6-8 with more than
600 business leaders from more than 30 countries attending.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA), the event's organizer, is scheduled to
hold two forums on October 6 and eight panel discussions on October 7, with the
goal of helping business leaders earn better profits from their investments in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The first forum on October 6 will feature Vice President Vincent Siew, an
economic technocrat and former premier, and Mr. Richard McCormack, vice chairman
of Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., Inc. It will analyze "Global investment perspectives
and Taiwan's emerging opportunities."</P>
      <P>The second forum will be moderated by Chiang Pin-kung, chairman of the Straits
Exchange Foundation. The topic will be "Leveraging cross-strait resources for
global markets."</P>
      <P>Business leaders and CEOs from Europe, the United States, Japan, China and
Taiwan are scheduled to join the two forums.</P>
      <P>The eight panel discussions will focus on several sectors in which Taiwan shines
-- including light-emitting diodes (LEDs), biotechnology, micro-electro-
mechanical systems (MEMS), and the public infrastructure investment plan.</P>
      <P>The other panel discussions will focus on the finance and insurance, tourism and
hospitality and logistics industries, as well as on new investment opportunities
arising from cross-strait deregulation.</P>
      <P>Dr. Yiin Chii-Ming, the Minister of Economic Affairs, will sign letters of
intent with foreign enterprises on October 7. Customized fact-finding trips will
be arranged at the request of investors on October 8.</P>
      <P>Warmer cross-strait relations under Taiwan's new government and the convenience
of direct cross-strait links are expected to benefit economies on both sides of
the Strait, and attract global capital, technology and talent to Taiwan's
superior investment environment.</P>
      <P>To enhance the nation's competitiveness, the government has also accelerated
industrial deregulation, for example by announcing recently it would relax
requirements on firms' establishment of headquarters or research and development
centers in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Apart from investment in Taiwan's high-tech and service sectors, the
government's US$130 billion infrastructure construction plan also creates many
business opportunities.</P>
      <P>Berton Chiu, director general of the Department of Investment Services, MOEA,
urged investors to seize the opportunities provided by the conference.</P>
      <P>Chiu said that even if the world economy is moving in an uncertain direction,
Asia still contains many fast-growing markets, and Taiwan is the most convenient
"springboard" into China and southeast Asia for global investors.</P>
      <P>Chiu emphasized that one of the key relaxations of cross-strait investment
regulations was the raising of the cap on China-bound investment from 40 percent
or less of a firm's net worth, to the current 60 percent.</P>
      <P>Taiwan welcomes Chinese business leaders to participate in its major development
projects, Chiu said.</P>
      <P>"Such structural changes will mean that it will be more convenient for
enterprises to do business, to set up an operations center or to seek business
partners in Taiwan, " he said.</P>
      <P>The 12 major construction projects include upgrading the island's transportation
network, and establishing a Taoyuan international "Air City" or logistics hub.</P>
      <P>Chiu noted that the projects will require massive investment, cooperation and
high-tech know-how from foreign firms, and said many such firms had already
inquired about the projects.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan cuts tariffs on imported oil products to zero</HEADLINE>

(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Executive Yuan decided Tuesday to cancel tariffs on imported diesel after
lowering tariffs last week on imported gasoline, fuel oil for aircraft and coal
oil.</P>
      <P>Government Information Office Deputy Minister Lin Ching-hsiu announced the
decision at a press conference following a meeting of an Executive Yuan task
force devoted to seeking stabilization of domestic commodity prices.</P>
      <P>Lin said Vice Premier Chiu Cheng-hsiung issued an instruction during the meeting
to complete an amendment to the regulations related to tariff tax as soon as
possible to allow the implementation of the new measure, which will relax the
growing financial burden on the public due to international crude oil prices.</P>
      <P>Lin also noted that the government has also decided to launch Sept. 1 a relief
program subsidizing farmers for their spending on fuel for agricultural
machinery. The move is part of the government's efforts to help tide the public
over surging fuel prices caused by crude oil price fluctuations in the
international market.</P>
      <P>However, at the press conference, the official cited a report compiled by the
Council of Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) that points out that
international crude oil prices fell from US$145 per barrel in early July to the
current US$120 per barrel.</P>
      <P>Because of this, there will be no large-scale rises in crude oil prices for the
rest of this year, the CEPD forecast.</P>
      <P>Citing an assessment by Global Insight Inc., Lin said the local consumer price
index (CPI) has been predicted to post an annual growth of 3.5 percent in 2008.</P>
      <P>Compared with other countries in East Asia, the CPI growth rate is higher only
than that of Japan's 1.3 percent, but lower than those of Hong Kong, India and
Vietnam, which range between 4.7 percent and 24.6 percent, Lin said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>In the midst of a serious "credit card slave" problem in Taiwan, the National
Alliance of Taiwan Women's Associations (NATWA) held a workshop Tuesday on the
idea of the microcredit system developed in Bangladesh in order to examine
Taiwan's financial policies and inspire Taiwan's underprivileged women.</P>
      <P>"The Grameen Bank (of Bangladesh) has proven that financial empowerment can be
key for women to play a greater role in bringing about positive changes in
society, " said Mujibul Alam Khan, a Bengali living in Taiwan and an activist in
social movement and non-government organizations.</P>
      <P>Microcredit,  created by the economist  Muhammad  Yunus in Bangladesh in 1976,
is an approach to combating poverty by lending small amounts of money, usually
within US$200, to people considered " unbankable, " such as the unemployed and
poor people, said Tseng Yu-hwei, who has translated Yunus' book "Banker to the
Poor."</P>
      <P>Of Grameen Bank's debtors, 93 percent are women, said Tseng, adding that the
repayment rate was as high as 98.5 percent in 2006.</P>
      <P>Compared to Yunus' contributions to alleviating poverty, Taiwan's financial
businesses only focus on profits and have created "credit card slaves" who are
unable to pay off their credit card debt, leading to unrecoverable loans and
creating a negative impact on Taiwan's economic growth, NATWA said in a
statement.</P>
      <P>According to the Ministry of Justice, about 510,000 people in Taiwan are "credit
card slaves."</P>
      <P>The World Vision charity organization has also operated the financial system in
47 countries, serving 560,000 clients and helping 1.7 million poor children to
improve their livelihoods, said Alice Chang of World Vision's public relations
department.</P>
      <P>"But in Taiwan, the system is still limited to discussion without concrete
measures, due to restrictions created by the country's financial regulations,"
said Chang.</P>
      <P>Yunus won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006 for his contributions to improving poor
people's living conditions through microcredit, which permits them to borrow
money from his Grameen Bank (bank of the village) to set up small businesses and
learn to be economically independent.</P>

      <P>Results of an online survey showed craftworks made with lazurite, or colored
glass, are top choices of Taiwanese people as gifts for foreign friends, a
survey conductor said Monday.</P>
      <P>According to Lin Cheng-yi, director-general of National Taiwan Craft Research
Institute, which conducted the survey recently, other top choices are pottery
and ceramic works, and bamboo handicrafs, followed by tea leaves and local
specialty foods.</P>
      <P>Lazurite artwork is the most popular due to its oriental elements and delicate
texture, Lin said.</P>
      <P>Lin introduced the survey results at a news conference in which he announced
Taiwan's participation  next month in the Tokyo International Gift Show Autumn
2008, a first for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The four-day show will be held at the Tokyo International Exhibition Center from
Sept. 2-5. Established in 1976, the show is one of the largest gift and
decorative accessory trade fairs in the world.</P>
      <P>Lin said Taiwan will have seven booths displaying handicrafts under three
categories: fashion design, green design, and technology design.</P>
      <P>The fashion design will showcase daily supplies of objects combining fashion
elements and hand-made textures, like bamboo-made electric fans and spectacle
frames, as well as many other items made with other craft skills like silver
forging, indigo dye, and ceramic art.</P>
      <P>Green design  includes  works made with recycled  friendly materials. There will
be miniatures of monkeys and owls made of iron or glass in the category, while
technology design includes consumer electronic products, like earphones and
mobile phones, made with crafts, Lin said.</P>
      <P>Huang Pi-tuan, minister of the Council for Cultural Affairs, which operates the
institue, said craft art is an important part of culture and creative industry,
which the government views highly and has made efforts in promoting.</P>
      <P>She expressed hope that Taiwan's participation in the Tokyo exhibition will help

      <P>The fair will be aimed at helping laborers gain knowledge of their work rights

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's legal team in the Office of Trade Negotiations (OTN) is ready for its
first trade dispute litigation in the World Trade Organization since its
accession in 2002, as it formally requested Monday the WTO establish a panel to
review a case on the European Union's alleged violation of the Information
Technology Agreement.</P>
      <P>"We have a strong case and are very optimistic about the future proceedings and
outcome, " said a senior official of the OTN, admitting however that there is
always pressure for any first trial, which requires tremendous professional work
and experience.</P>
      <P>The young OTN legal team, which has been in place less than year and is composed
of four lawyers in Taipei and the legal council of Taiwan's mission to the WTO,
so far has conducted all the legal work on the case independently, but during
the decisive panel review and deliberation, it will hire an experienced trade
litigator as an advisor, according to the OTN.</P>
      <P>After the consultations with the EU failed to resolve their differences, Taiwan,
together with the U.S. and Japan, decided to take the last resort by asking the
WTO to establish a dispute settlement panel to review and rule whether the
European Union (EU) has failed to accord duty-free treatment to certain products
covered by the WTO Information Technology Agreement (ITA).</P>
      <P>The high-profile trade dispute, a precedent-setting case for the implementation
of the ITA, is of special significance to Taiwan, since, in addition to the huge
commercial and trade interests, it represents Taiwan's very first trade
litigation in the world trade body and a crucial test of Taiwan's  legal
capacity  in an international arena.</P>
      <P>According to the U.S. Trade Representative, the EU has adopted a series of
measures that resulted in a new duty on imports of specific high-tech
productsXcable  boxes that can access the internet,  flat panel computer
monitors, and certain computer printers that can also scan, fax and copy. Global
exports of these products were estimated at over US$70 billion in 2007.</P>
      <P>The EU's violation of the ITA, a plural-lateral trade agreement among 71 WTO
members, has brought serious damage to Taiwan's related IT products, LCDs in
particular. The annual production value of Taiwan's LCD industry has exceeded
NT$1 trillion (US$32.79 billion) since 2006 and is likely to generate NT$2
trillion by 2015, according to official statistics.</P>
      <P>The tallies also showed that the EU has collected as much as NT$19.6 billion
(US$650 million) in import duties on Taiwanese LCDs.</P>
      <P>The OTN official stressed that they are ready for the challenge of the future
trade litigation and are confident that Taiwan's trade interests as well as fair
trade will prevail in the end.</P>
      <P>The WTO Dispute Settlement Body will consider the joint request for the
establishment of a panel at its meeting on Aug. 29. But due to its complex
procedure, the panel could be set up in November at the earliest.</P>

      <P>Fifty-eight percent of the respondents to a recent poll said they feel happy
about their lives, but many also voiced dissatisfaction  with their income and
the government's performance, according to the results of the happiness index
poll published Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The poll, conducted by the Taiwan Competitiveness Forum, a group of academics,
asked the respondents about their happiness, family relations, jobs, social
activities, health, religion and beliefs, political rights and views on the
government's performance.</P>
      <P>The results show that around 58 percent said they feel happy about their lives
and that family relations are the biggest source of happiness.</P>
      <P>But they feel most upset about their incomes and the government's performance,
at a ratio of 47 percent and 55 percent, respectively.</P>
      <P>Those with annual incomes of over NT$1.01 million tend to feel most happy in
terms of income, while those who earn less than NT$1 million feel less happy.
Those who earn less than NT$300,000 a year expressed the lowest satisfaction.</P>
      <P>Hsieh Ming-huei, deputy secretary-general of the forum, noted that after the new
administration was inaugurated May 20, it lifted a six-month freeze on petroleum
prices.</P>
      <P>"This, coupled with inflation and surging raw material costs, has led to greater
discontent and the government has to address the issue squarely," Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>He also pointed out that those who described themselves as "very happy" and
"very unhappy"  accounted  for most of the survey respondents, in contrast with
a small number of those with more moderate views, showing that the Taiwanese
people have starkly differing views on various issues.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted Aug. 1-5, collecting 1,119 effective samples with a

    <TEXT>The Washington Post: Musharraf Exits, but Uncertainty Remains

Pakistani  President Pervez Musharraf's  resignation  Monday signaled the
beginning of a new round of political uncertainty as the country's civilian
government tries to reshape the legacy of nearly nine years of military rule.

The Washington Times:Musharraf leaves doubts

The long-anticipated resignation of President Pervez Musharraf on Monday may not
hurt the U. S. war on terror because the Pakistani leader had not done a
particularly good job of confronting al Qaeda and the Taliban, U.S.
counterterrorism officials and Pakistan analysts said.</TEXT>

      <P>Taiwan and the Philippines have signed guidelines for a direct employment
program to enhance bilateral labor relations, Tsai Meng-liang, the director of
the Foreign Workers Administration of the Council of Labor Affairs (CLA), said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Tsai said Taiwan's representative to the Philippines Donald C.T. Lee and his
Filipino counterpart Antonio I. Basilio inked the agreement in Cebu late last
month, witnessed by CLA Deputy Minister Pan Shih-Wei and Philippines' Department
of Labor and Employment Secretary Marianito D. Roque.</P>
      <P>Under the guidelines, direct employment coverage will expand from current
caregivers to foreign workers in the manufacturing and construction  industries,
Tsai said,  adding  that application procedures will also be simplified.</P>
      <P>In order to ensure the quality of health care, the Philippines "will also
enhance pre-employment training for their workers before they  leave  for
Taiwan,  such  as courses  in language  and cardiopulmonary resuscitation," Tsai
added.</P>
      <P>In addition, the two countries will collaborate to help reduce the number of
repatriated and absconding Filipino workers, said Tsai, noting that as of the
end of July, 2,700 Filipino workers were reported missing.</P>
      <P>About 85,000 Filipinos out of a total 358,000 foreign workers are presently in
Taiwan, working mostly as caregivers, according to the Ministry of the Interior.</P>

      <P>The southern port city of Kaohsiung has seen 53 cases of dengue fever confirmed
so far this summer, the city's top health official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Ho Chi-kung, director of Kaohsiung City Department of Public Health, told an
interdepartmental meeting that the first dengue fever case in Kaohsiung this
summer occurred on June 22, and that since then the number of confirmed cases

dengue fever in Taiwan this year.</P>
      <P>Ho said most of these confirmed cases were concentrated in Kaohsiung's northern
Nanzih District.</P>
      <P>Worried about a further spread of the epidemic, Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu

    <HEADLINE>TRA to launch regular tourist railway 'cruises' on scenic lines</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan Railways Administration (TRA) is working to launch regular runs of
"cruise liner-style" trains next month on three railroad lines that pass through
scenic areas of Taiwan, the TRA deputy director general said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chang Ying-huei explained that the idea of offering regular tourism-oriented
rides came up after the TRA's first "cruise train" attracted a full train of
passengers for a one-day sightseeing tour on the Hualien-Taitung Line along
Taiwan's eastern coast Aug. 11.</P>
      <P>A similar cruise on the Taipei-Suao Line along the scenic northeastern coast
also saw packed tourists when it set off earlier in the day, while tickets for
the first tourist train of its kind on the Kaohsiung-Taitung South Link Line,
scheduled to run on Aug. 23, have sold out, according to the TRA.</P>
      <P>Encouraged by the popularity of the experimental train services, the TRA plans
to open one cruise train everyday from Monday to Thursday on each of the three
railway lines, Chang said.</P>
      <P>The planned new services are expected to generate additional revenues of around
NT$400,000 (US$12,700) a day for the TRA, he added, bragging of the low cost for
the one-day tourist railway cruise because passengers can save on lodging when
traveling to sightsee scenic spots along the railway lines.</P>
      <P>Unlike the usual trains that only stop for a short time at each station, the
"cruise train" makes longer stops at certain stations to allow passengers to
disembark and tour attractions, according to the TRA, which describes the way in
which the train journey has been adapted to a form similar to that of an
international cruise liner.</P>
      <P>The trains also run at speeds as low as 35 kph to allow passengers good views of
scenic landscapes along the railway lines.</P>
      <P>Chang said the TRA will extend the time span of a stop at popular stations
depending on tourist demand under the condition that such a longer stop won't
affect other common trains.</P>
      <P>The administration will also adjust the tourist cruises during different
seasons; for example, the train will run at a low speed during a flower season
to allow passengers to view blossoms along the railroad, Chang added.</P>
      <P>On Wednesday, the TRA will begin sales of tickets for the second cruise train on
the Hualien-Taitung Line, slated for Aug. 25.</P>
      <P>The planned cruise will take passengers to travel between Shulin in Taipei
County and Guanshan in Taitung. It is scheduled to set off from Shulin at 6: 39
a.m., making a 35-minute stopover in Hualien before arriving in Guanshan at 2:32
p.m.</P>
      <P>The tourist train will then begin its return run from Guanshan at 5:10 p.m. that
same day, the TRA said, noting that the round-trip ticket is priced at NT$1,016
for adult and lower for children and the senior citizens aged above 65.</P>

      <P>In line with the smoke-free campaign being promoted by the central government,

    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Vincent Siew said Tuesday that lower tax rates will benefit the
country's financial reforms and contribute to a better investment environment.</P>
      <P>Siew made the remarks in a speech at a forum on the vision of turning Taiwan
into an Asia-Pacific financial operations center, organized by several financial
institutes, including the Taiwan Academy of Banking and Finance and the
Securities and Future Institute.</P>
      <P>Siew said Taiwan has great room for improvement in lowering its tax rates, which
are relatively high compared with those of its important competitors like Hong
Kong and Singapore.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that Taiwan's business income tax rate was 25 percent this year,
while those of Hong Kong and Singapore were 16.5 percent and 18 percent,
respectively.</P>
      <P>In terms of personal  income tax rates,  Taiwan's highest percentage was
registered at 40 this year, while Hong Kong's was 17 percent and Singapore's was
20 percent, Siew went on, adding that inheritance and gift taxes, which have
been abolished by both Hong Kong and Singapore, were registered at a maximum of
50 percent in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Despite its higher tax rates, Taiwan still has advantages in location,
competitiveness in high tech, creativity and innovation, and capital, all of
which will contribute to the vision of making Taiwan a financial operations
center for the Asia-Pacific, according to Siew.</P>
      <P>He said the government  will focus on lifting  investment restrictions, boosting
more frequent financial interaction between Taiwan and China, enhancing
personnel training and designing a light and fair tax system.</P>
      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan told reporters after the forum that increasing the
competitiveness of Taiwan's tax system will come before a more fair system is
devised.</P>
      <P>Morris Li, country officer of Citibank Taiwan, suggested that the government
complete legislation of a financial services law soon and establish regulations
on capital market integration to prepare domestic financial institutes for
strong competition from foreign and Chinese institutes when the market expands
and becomes more open in the future.</P>

      <P>Kaohsiung County Magistrate Yang Chiu-hsing, at a news conference Tuesday
afternoon, reminded county residents to be on the alert against a possible
enterovirus resurgence following the start of the new school year on Sept. 1.</P>
      <P>A total of 346 serious enterovirus cases have been recorded around Taiwan so far
this year, including 39 cases in Kaohsiung County.</P>
      <P>Yang said that although the outbreak has been brought under control with no new

cases.</P>
      <P>Accompanied by other top level officials, including Kaohsiung County Health
Bureau Director Huang Ching-ching, Yang urged parents to cultivate the habit of
frequent hand washing among their children to avoid infection, and to maintain a
clean environment in and around their homes at all times.</P>
      <P>Health bureau officials also called for all kindergartens and elementary schools
to carry out disinfection work in their classrooms and to thoroughly clean all

      <P>A 7-year-old from China's Zhejiang Province who came to Taiwan last week to be
given "electronic ears" after being diagnosed with large vestibular aqueduct
syndrome was overjoyed with her new-found ability to hear when she attended a
press conference Tuesday.</P>
      <P>"I can hear! " exclaimed the child, identified only as Wen-wen, while hugging
her mother at the press conference, which was also attended by 11-year-old San-
san, who also traveled from China to Taiwan to receive the surgery at the Cheng
Hsin Rehabilitation Medical Center in suburban Taipei.</P>
      <P>The two young patients seldom talked to others and could not hear clearly ever
since birth, said a doctor at the press conference, adding that the situation
worsened for Wen-wen after a fall and a bump to the head.</P>
      <P>According to Chen Kuang-chao, director of the otolaryngological department at
the Cheng Hsin center, large vestibular aqueduct syndrome is a connatural
disease of one or both ears, often accompanied by sensori-neural hearing loss
the gradually leads to deafness.</P>
      <P>The best way to improve the patient's hearing, said Chen, is to implant
"electronic ears."</P>
      <P>"It costs 250,000 Chinese yuan (US$36,400) for the electronic ear surgery in
China, a procedure that leaves not only large wounds but also fails to preserve
the remnants of original listening ability, while the surgery costs about
220,000 yuan in Taiwan, with more skillful surgeons and preservation of residual
hearing, " said San-san's mother.</P>
      <P>Chen said he used minimal invasive surgery on Wen-wen that does not require the
shaving off of the hair and leaves a scar of only around 2.5 cm.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the technique used in Taiwan takes only three hours, half the time of
the traditional surgery, and requires only an overnight hospital stay, Chen went
on, adding that he has performed the procedure more than 100 times with no
complications.</P>
      <P>Chen said the two children were so curious and excited by their new sense that
they stomped on the ground and banged the lids of trash cans, creating a lot of
noise they had never been able to hear clearly in the past.</P>

      <P>A retired diplomat with close ties to President Ma Ying-jeou has been tapped to
serve as Taiwan's new representative to Japan, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
(MOFA) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>John C. T. Feng, a former ambassador to the Dominican Republic who received his
elementary and middle school education in Japan, will be Taiwan's new
representative in Tokyo, according to the official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.</P>
      <P>Noting that Feng is one of Ma's most trusted international affairs advisers, the
official said his new appointment betrays the level of importance the government
places on relations with Japan.</P>
      <P>The Japanese government has already agreed to the appointment and the MOFA will
formally announce Feng's assignation after completing administrative
formalities, the official said.</P>
      <P>Feng, the son of a career diplomat, lived in Japan with his family during his
formative years. He traveled to the United States to continue his studies after
completing his secondary education in Japan. He has a master's degree in public
administration from Harvard University.</P>
      <P>Feng's diplomatic career started with a position as a secretary at Taiwan's
representative office in Washington, D.C. After returning to Taipei, he served
as news department chief at the previously Kuomintang-owned Broadcasting Corp.
of China and as editor-in-chief of the CNA. He later served as director of the
MOFA's Protocol Department.</P>
      <P>Feng was named the country's ambassador to the Dominican Republic in the
Caribbean after the Democratic Progressive Party took power in 2000 and he
retired from diplomatic service last year to help with Ma's presidential
campaign.</P>
      <P>Feng will fill the post left  vacant  by Koh Se-kai,  a pro-independence
advocate who resigned in June over differences of opinion with the Foreign
Ministry on the handling of a diplomatic row between Taipei and Tokyo following
a boat collision in waters near the disputed Tiaoyutai Islands, which are
claimed by Taiwan, China and Japan.</P>
      <P>The row subsided through high-level communications, with Japanese officials
apologizing for the incident,  in which a Taiwanese recreational fishing boat
sank after colliding with a Japanese coast guard vessel, and promising to
compensate the Taiwanese boat owner.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan-Japan relations were close during Koh's tenure, with Japan agreeing
to offer visa-free entry for Taiwanese tourists and recognizing Taiwan's
driver's licenses.</P>
      <P>Although Ma campaigned on a plaftform of rapprochment with China, He has assured
visiting Japanese politicians over the past few months that cross-Taiwan Strait

      <P>This year's U.N. bid promotion will replace large street-corner advertising with
deep penetration into the world's elite circles in seeking public opinion
favoring Taiwan, Government Information Office (GIO) Vice Minister William Yi
said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Yi told CNA that GIO Minister Vanessa Yea-ping Shih will put Taiwan's strong
will to participate in the international organization into words that will
inform the world.</P>
      <P>The GIO has asked all Taiwanese correspondents in foreign countries to provide
information and background on Taiwan's U.N. bid to local media and will invite
international media and think tanks to attend related seminars to give them a
better understanding of Taiwan's relations with China and the country's need for
U.N. membership, Yi said.</P>
      <P>The promotion measures are aimed at arousing international awareness of Taiwan's
exclusion from global issues like environmental protection, health, anti-
terrorism, and of its being barred from joining international organizations, Yi
said.</P>
      <P>The Presidential Office confirmed Aug. 12 that Taiwan's U.N. bid this year will
sidestep the thorny question of what name the country should use to apply,  and
instead focus on securing Taiwan's "meaningful participation" in the
organization.</P>
      <P>For the past 15 years, Taiwan has failed in its bids to become a U.N. member due
to opposition from China. Last year's failed bid was the first time the previous
administration had used Taiwan instead of the Republic of China -- the country's
formal name -- in a move to highlight the nation's de facto independence.</P>
      <P>This year's U.N. bid was delivered to the General Assembly by 17 of Taiwan's
diplomatic allies Aug. 14, in the hope that it will be included on the
assembly's agenda. The assembly will convene Sept. 16.</P>
      <P>Yi said New York, where the U.N. General Assembly takes place, will not be the

Security Council permanent members -- Russia, Britain, France and the U.S. --
will all be covered.</P>
      <P>This year's promotion will save money but will not necessarily be any less

    <HEADLINE>Court to rule on defamation suit against former president Sept. 9</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 19 (CNA)
08/19/08  23:12:00
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taipei District Court said Tuesday that it will rule Sept. 9 on a defamation
case against former President Chen Shui-bian filed by five retired navy
officials in connection with the purchase of Lafayette frigates in early 1990s.</P>
      <P>The two-and-a-half- hour court session saw Chen and two other co-defendants --
opposition Democratic Progressive Party Legislator Lai Ching-te and former DPP
Legislator Hsu Kuo-yung -- face off with Lei Hsueh-ming, a retired vice admiral.</P>
      <P>Security was tight, as Chen was kicked in the buttocks by an irate protester
outside the building during his last court session in late July.</P>
      <P>Making  his  first  public  appearance  since  the alleged money-laundering
scandal by members of the former first family came to light last week, Chen was
stony-faced. His request for leave from the court session was rejected.</P>
      <P>Chen, Lai and Hsu all said that comments they have made on the Lafayette
purchase in public places or on TV were "based on reasonable doubt."</P>
      <P>Chen also said that the Lafayette frigate scandal still has to be solved, but
this "does not mean there is necessarily no such thing (as Lei's connection with
corruption)."</P>
      <P>Lei for his part said the allegations by the trio have not been substantiated
with evidence.</P>
      <P>Lei, a former chief of the navy's Shipbuilding Office, said it was then-
President Lee Teng-hui who approved the purchase of the Lafayette frigates from
France instead of Korean frigates as had originally been planned.</P>
      <P>He noted that when Capt. Ying Ching-feng died in 1993 -- widely believed to have
been murdered when he was about to blow the whistle on colleagues taking
kickbacks -- he had already been retired from the navy for more than two years.</P>
      <P>Lei and the four other retired navy officers are demanding US$66 million in
compensation from Chen and the other two defendants.</P>
      <P>Chen alleged to reporters in 2005 that Lei and several other officers together
took US$20 million in bribes in a US$2.8 billion deal to buy six Lafayette
frigates.</P>
      <P>The bribery scandal came to the forefront of local politics in 1993 following
Ying's death.</P>
      <P>After taking office in 2000, Chen pledged to seek out the officials believed to
have received bribes in the deal. Lei was investigated but cleared due to lack
of evidence.</P>

    <HEADLINE>3rd round of financial reform to focus on globalization</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.19  (CNA)
08/20/08  00:37:27
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Future financial reform will focus on globalization, Minister of Finance Li Shu-
der said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Li made the remarks after Vice Premier Chiu Cheng-hsiung said earlier that day
that the Kuomintang (KMT) government will not talk about the so-called "second
round" of financial reform anymore amid allegations that the recently exposed
money laundering case allegedly involving former President Chen Shui-bian's
family might be related with bribes in the "second round" financial reform.</P>
      <P>The "second round" of financial reform was a priority project launched by Chen's
administration to streamline the bloated financial market by trimming the number
of local financial holding companies through mergers and acquisitions within a
specified period of time. Speculation had been rife that the reform process was
tarnished by favoritism and bribery.</P>
      <P>In an attempt to decouple the KMT government's policy direction with its
predecessor's, Chiu said future financial reform should be code-named the "third
round" of financial reform.</P>
      <P>Li echoed Chiu's view, saying that the "third round" of financial reform will
not set any time frame nor limits on the number of local banks or financial
holding companies.</P>
      <P>Instead, Li said, the Finance Ministry will focus on accelerating globalization
of local financial institutions and service market. For instance, he said, the
ministry will give priority to attracting foreign investors to take over a 20
percent stake in the state-owed Taiwan Financial Holding Co.</P>
      <P>Priority will also be given to helping financial  holding companies in which the
government has stakes, such as First Financial Holding and Mega Financial
Holding, to go global, Li added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A retired diplomat with close ties to President Ma Ying-jeou has been tapped to
serve as Taiwan's new representative to Japan, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
(MOFA) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>John C. T. Feng, a former ambassador to the Dominican Republic who received his
elementary and middle school education in Japan, will be Taiwan's new
representative in Tokyo, according to the official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.</P>
      <P>Noting that Feng is one of Ma's most trusted international affairs advisers, the
official said his new appointment betrays the level of importance the government
places on relations with Japan.</P>
      <P>The Japanese government has already agreed to the appointment and the MOFA will
formally announce Feng's assignation after completing administrative
formalities, the official said.</P>
      <P>Feng, the son of a career diplomat, lived in Japan with his family during his
formative years. He traveled to the United States to continue his studies after
completing his secondary education in Japan. He has a master's degree in public
administration from Harvard University.</P>
      <P>Feng's diplomatic career started with a position as a secretary at Taiwan's
representative office in Washington, D.C. After returning to Taipei, he served
as news department chief at the previously Kuomintang-owned Broadcasting Corp.
of China and as editor-in-chief of the CNA. He later served as director of the
MOFA's Protocol Department.</P>
      <P>Feng was named the country's ambassador to the Dominican Republic in the
Caribbean after the Democratic Progressive Party took power in 2000 and he
retired from diplomatic service last year to help with Ma's presidential
campaign.</P>
      <P>Feng will fill the post left  vacant  by Koh Se-kai,  a pro-independence
advocate who resigned in June over differences of opinion with the Foreign
Ministry on the handling of a diplomatic row between Taipei and Tokyo following
a boat collision in waters near the disputed Tiaoyutai Islands, which are
claimed by Taiwan, China and Japan.</P>
      <P>The row subsided through high-level communications, with Japanese officials
apologizing for the incident,  in which a Taiwanese recreational fishing boat
sank after colliding with a Japanese coast guard vessel, and promising to
compensate the Taiwanese boat owner.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan-Japan relations were close during Koh's tenure, with Japan agreeing
to offer visa-free entry for Taiwanese tourists and recognizing Taiwan's
driver's licenses.</P>
      <P>Although Ma campaigned on a plaftform of rapprochment with China, He has assured
visiting Japanese politicians over the past few months that cross-Taiwan Strait
detente will not affect Taiwan's efforts to maintain good relations with Japan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.N. bid promotion to forgo large advertisements: GIO</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>This year's U.N. bid promotion will replace large street-corner advertising with
deep penetration into the world's elite circles in seeking public opinion
favoring Taiwan, Government Information Office (GIO) Vice Minister William Yi
said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Yi told CNA that GIO Minister Vanessa Yea-ping Shih will put Taiwan's strong
will to participate in the international organization into words that will
inform the world.</P>
      <P>The GIO has asked all Taiwanese correspondents in foreign countries to provide
information and background on Taiwan's U.N. bid to local media and will invite
international media and think tanks to attend related seminars to give them a
better understanding of Taiwan's relations with China and the country's need for
U.N. membership, Yi said.</P>
      <P>The promotion measures are aimed at arousing international awareness of Taiwan's
exclusion from global issues like environmental protection, health, anti-
terrorism, and of its being barred from joining international organizations, Yi
said.</P>
      <P>The Presidential Office confirmed Aug. 12 that Taiwan's U.N. bid this year will
sidestep the thorny question of what name the country should use to apply,  and
instead focus on securing Taiwan's "meaningful participation" in the
organization.</P>
      <P>For the past 15 years, Taiwan has failed in its bids to become a U.N. member due
to opposition from China. Last year's failed bid was the first time the previous
administration had used Taiwan instead of the Republic of China -- the country's
formal name -- in a move to highlight the nation's de facto independence.</P>
      <P>This year's U.N. bid was delivered to the General Assembly by 17 of Taiwan's
diplomatic allies Aug. 14, in the hope that it will be included on the
assembly's agenda. The assembly will convene Sept. 16.</P>
      <P>Yi said New York, where the U.N. General Assembly takes place, will not be the
only target of the promotion and that capital cities of the other four U.N.
Security Council permanent members -- Russia, Britain, France and the U.S. --
will all be covered.</P>
      <P>This year's promotion will save money but will not necessarily be any less
effective, Yi said.</P>

contribute to peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait, including direct weekend
cross-strait charter flights and relaxed restrictions on visits by Chinese

      <P>"Both sides of the Taiwan Strait hope to resolve major issues of concern through
continued dialogue and consultations," she continued.</P>
      <P>The government also attaches great importance to the cooperative relations with
the United States, and a better cross-strait relation will be in the interests
of the United States, Lai said.</P>
      <P>For his part, Engel said he has always supported the Republic of China as an
independent, sovereign state, and he expressed hope that the people on both
sides of the Taiwan Strait  will resolve cross-strait issues in a pragmatic
manner.</P>
      <P>In related news, Lai will depart for Los Angeles Aug. 21 on her first overseas

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan develops technology to turn livestock waste into fuel oil</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Aug.   20  (CNA)
08/20/08  13:16:12
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A research  institute  under the Cabinet-level  Council  of Agriculture  (COA)
has successfully researched and developed a technique for turning livestock
waste into fuel oil.</P>
      <P>The COA Taiwan Livestock Research Institute based in the southern county of
Tainan has distilled the animal waste into fuel oil using a thermal chemical
conversion technology and facility that it developed recently, said Kuo Meng-
teh, a researcher and project manager at the institute.</P>
      <P>The distilled fuel oil contains an average 78 percent carbon, 10.4 percent
hydrogen and 4.85 percent nitrogen -- a makeup that could yield nearly 6,000
calories of energy from every kilogram of "raw material," if the waste is from
pigs, Kuo said.</P>
      <P>The yield could be even higher -- 9,110 calories -- if the "raw material" is
obtained from cattle, Kuo added.</P>
      <P>The technology was researched and developed mainly because the procedures that
have been used in the treatment of livestock waste are usually high energy
consuming, particularly during the third stage of aerobic treatment, according
to Kuo.</P>
      <P>In addition to solving the "smelly" problem of livestock waste, the technology's
major merit is helping turn animal waste, which usually contains 70-80 percent
of water, into fuel oil, Kuo asserted.</P>
      <P>Kuo's research team has secured patent rights from the Ministry of Economic
Affairs for the technology.</P>
      <P>Kuo said, however, that it is still too early to tell whether it would be
economically viable to use the technology in commercial applications, as it is
still in the developmental stages in the lab.</P>

      <P>The number of older Taiwanese workers who are unemployed has more than doubled
over the past 10 years, which indicates increased employment barriers for this
group, the Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>CLA statistics showed that 75,000 workers aged 45-64 in Taiwan were unemployed
in 2007, compared with 34,000 workers in 1997.</P>
      <P>In 2007, older employees were out of jobs for an average 28.2 weeks -- 3.6 weeks
more than the average unemployment period for the entire workforce, according to
the statistics.</P>
      <P>Among the 75,000 older jobless workers, 26,000 or 37.27 percent were offered
employment but turned down the jobs, mainly because the pay offered was too low.</P>
      <P>Of the remaining 44,000 workers who failed to find any employment opportunities,
59.01 percent were hampered by age restrictions set by employers, while another
18.59 percent were not equipped with the skills required by employers.</P>
      <P>The increase in the number of older unemployed workers was also partly
attributed to the aging of Taiwan's population.</P>
      <P>The statistics revealed that there were 5.51 million people aged 45-64 in Taiwan
in 2007 -- up 1.8 million or 48.71 percent from 1997 -- with the labor force
participation rate of people in this age group averaging 60.55 percent.</P>
      <P>The labor force participation rate stood at 75.57 percent among those aged
45-49, 65.57 percent among the 50-54 age group, 49.64 percent among those 55-59,
and 32 percent among those aged 60-64, according to the CLA.</P>

      <P>An Aid for Trade Seminar was held Wednesday in Taipei by the International
Cooperation and Development Fund (ICDF) to exchange views and experiences with
other countries on the new trend in international cooperation, which will be an
important part of Taiwan's foreign aid policy, according to the ICDF.</P>
      <P>Aid for trade refers to assistance to developing countries, especially least
developed ones, to build the trade capacity and infrastructure they need to
benefit from trade openings, according to the ICDF.</P>
      <P>In his keynote speech, Hsieh Fadah, Vice Minister of Economic Affairs, noted
that the aid for trade concept has been gaining support in the global aid arena,
and that Taiwan has gone from being a beneficiary to an aid provider.</P>
      <P>As beneficiary of aid from international organizations and developed countries,
Taiwan was able to carry out a series of economic development plans and lay the
foundation, between 1950 and 1975, for future economic growth, Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>At present, as a donor that has made economic strides, Taiwan provides aid, such
as technical assistance, to other developing countries, he noted, citing the
conversion of salt fields for highly profitable shrimp farming in El Salvador
and assistance provided to Honduras in the area of Tilapia aquaculture.</P>
      <P>"Through cooperation and sharing we are able to promote balanced development
among regions," Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>One of the foreign guests at the seminar, Esperanza Duran, executive director of
the Agency for International Trade Information and Cooperation and an
experienced economic analyst, was also invited to give a lecture.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan ICDF was founded in 1996 with the objective of strengthening
international  cooperation  and enhancing foreign relations by promoting
economic development, social progress and the welfare of the people in partner
nations around the world.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou received an approval rating of 47 percent for his
performance over the past three months, according to the results of a government
poll released Tuesday.</P>
      <P>However, the results of the poll, conducted by the Cabinet-level Research,
Development and Evaluation Commission Aug. 14-15 with 1,094 valid samples and a
margin of error of 2.96 percentage points, also showed that 36.3 percent of the
respondents were displeased with Ma's performance to date.</P>
      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan received an approval rating of 41.9 percent and a
disapproval rating of 37.9 percent for the same period, the results showed.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 44.1 percent of the respondents said they were pleased with the
overall performance of the Cabinet, while 39.6 percent expressed
dissatisfaction.  In terms of the Cabinet's  future performance, 57.4 percent of
those polled said they were optimistic, and 13.9 percent indicated that they
were not.</P>
      <P>The results also showed that 55 percent thought that the Cabinet was doing a
better job than two months ago, while 28 percent disagreed.</P>
      <P>In addition, 52.5 percent of the respondents were optimistic about Liu's
performance in the future, while 13.6 percent held the opposite view.</P>
      <P>Minister of the commission Jiang Yi-huah said the poll indicated that the
government has entered a better stage of administration.</P>
      <P>In general, the government's policies on energy conservation, integrity,  and
environmental protection have won the public's approval, along with its
achievements in improving cross-Taiwan Strait relations, developing diplomatic
relations, and introducing measures beneficial to the disadvantaged, according
to the poll,</P>
      <P>The areas of dissatisfaction were the administration's policies on commodity
prices, social security and education reform, the poll showed.</P>
      <P>However, according to Hsiao Chuan-cheng, a political science professor at
National Taiwan University, the poll does not reflect dramatic changes in the
approval rating of the current government.</P>
      <P>According to Hsiao, a poll conducted by the opposition Democratic Progressive
Party two months ago showed that Ma's approval rating had plummeted to 37.1
percent, with his disapproval rating being 56.7 percent at a time when the
public was uneasy over surging prices and the government's ineffective typhoon
emergency response.</P>
      <P>Hsiao said the newly released results of the government poll reflected  the
public's approval of lower oil prices and the government's efforts to strengthen
typhoon response measures.</P>

      <P>Ruling Kuomintang legislators on Wednesday welcomed the administration's
appointment of John C.T. Feng, former ambassador to the Dominican Republic, as
Taiwan's representative to Japan.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced Tuesday that Feng, a seasoned
diplomat, will serve as Taiwan's top representative to Japan and that the
government of Japan has consented to his appointment.</P>
      <P>Feng, 62, was a secretary at Taiwan's representative office in Washington, D.C.
between 1974-1976 and served as ambassador to the Dominican Republic between
2000-2007. The son of a career diplomat, he received his elementary and middle
school education in Japan.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Lee Chia-ching, who studied in Japan and has paid close attention
to Taiwan-Japan relations over the years, said that Feng is a high-caliber
professional diplomat with rich career experience.</P>
      <P>Lee said Feng's fluency in Japanese is a plus, adding that it is important for
Taiwan's liaison officer in Japan to develop deeper and wider connections in
Tokyo and gain a better understanding of the country's political environment.</P>
      <P>Lee suggested that Feng try to consolidate Taiwan-Japan relations by tapping
into the influential Taiwanese expatriate community in Japan, seeking to learn
from the experiences of Taiwanese officials stationed  in  Japan,  and
following  the  lead  of Japanese parliamentarians and Taiwanese legislators in
their efforts to cement the bilateral ties between the two countries.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Lee Hung-chun,  who has visited Japan with Legislative Yuan
Speaker Wang Jin-pyng to promote parliamentarian exchanges, said he could not
think of a better candidate than Feng to serve as Taiwan's representative to
Tokyo.</P>
      <P>"Feng is the best choice for such an important post since he is a veteran
diplomat, speaks Japanese fluently, and most importantly, he maintains close
ties with President Ma Ying-jeou," Lee added.</P>
      <P>Feng, one of Ma's most trusted international affairs advisers, will be filling
the post that was vacated by Koh Se-kai in June this year.</P>
      <P>Koh,  a pro-independence  advocate,  resigned in June over differences of
opinion with the Foreign Ministry on the handling of a diplomatic row between
Taipei and Tokyo following a boat collision in waters near the disputed
Tiaoyutai Islands, which are claimed by Taiwan, China and Japan.</P>

      <P>The Taiwan pharmaceutical industry's production for the first five months of
this year reached NT$23.84 billion (US$759.2 million) , up 6.7 percent over the
same period a year earlier, the Industry and Intenology Intelligence Services
(ITIS) said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>One of the prime drivers behind that growth was production of active
pharmaceutical ingredients, which increased by 34.7 percent year-on-year for the
period to hit NT$4.5 billion, according to ITIS analyst Hsu Yu-chen.</P>
      <P>Hsu noted that production of active pharmaceutical ingredients has been very
strong over the past year, with monthly production hitting a record high of
NT$1.16 billion in October of 2007 and breaking the NT$1 billion mark again
twice during the January-May period of this year.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the production value of western drugs, the main staple of Taiwan
pharmaceutical companies, rose by only 0.9 percent for the January-May period to
reach NT$16.96 billion, according to Hsu.</P>
      <P>Hsu said that the one of the main reasons for the slow growth was that Taiwan
pharmaceutical makers are still reeling from the 15 percent downward adjustment
last September in National Health Insurance co-payments for drugs.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Hsu forecast that the industry's overall production will likely
continue to experience stable growth in the months ahead with an expected surge
in exports of active pharmaceutical ingredients. enditem/ pc</P>

      <P>The government is expected to unveil a policy blueprint next month for allowing
Chinese investment in Taiwan, Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Vice Chairman Fu
Dong-cheng said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Relevant government agencies have been working on regulation amendments and
arrangements and are likely to unveil an initial plan in September, with
potential investment from Chinese market players eyeing Taiwan's manufacturing
sector set to be approved first, Fu said.</P>
      <P>Chinese investment in the manufacturing sector as well as issues related to two
accords inked in Beijing by Taiwan and China in June on setting up direct
weekend cross-Taiwan Strait passenger charter flights and Taiwan's admission of
a larger number of Chinese tourists, and those linked to the opening of direct
shipping links and cargo charter flights, will be listed as the top topics to be
addressed, he explained.</P>
      <P>The establishment of direct shipping services and cargo charter flights will be
the prime discussion topics in the next round of bilateral negotiations,
expected to take place in late October or early November, he noted.</P>
      <P>A broad range of issues such as capital movement, the purchase of commercial
property and offices by Chinese investors, as well as the entry to Taiwan of
Chinese management personnel, all are implicated in the granting of permission
for Chinese to invest in the local market, he pointed out.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Recent seismological surveys of the Sanchiao fault in the Taipei Basin have
revealed that the fault line is much longer than estimated and that the
activities of such a long fault could result in earthquakes measuring 7.0 or
greater on the Richter Scale, according to the Central Geological Survey (CGS).</P>
      <P>CGS experts said that surveys in the past have produced an estimate that puts
the total length of the Sanchiao fault at some 20 kilometers, stretching from
Shulin City in the southwest of Taipei County to the Guandu Plain north of
Taipei City. Some seismologists have also speculated that the fault has been
inactive for some 11,000 years.</P>
      <P>However, the latest surveys conducted by the CGS showed that the fault's actual
extension is as long as 40 kilometers and that it extends beyond Datun Mountain
to Jinshan on the north coast.</P>
      <P>"Some evidence suggests that the fault structure may extend even further into
the sea, and some theories suggest a fault that combines land and sea structures
and could produce even bigger earthquakes," said Chiang Chung Jung, deputy
director of the CGS.</P>
      <P>Jung said that conventional means of measuring faults can be influenced by human
activities and are less accurate than the new method. The new detectors are
positioned underground to obtain greater accuracy and to allow for the detection
of even small fault activities, he explained.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, experts at the Central Weather Bureau (CWB) said that although a
longer fault line can theoretically cause bigger earthquakes, northern Taiwan is
relatively geologically stable, with only one percent of the total number of
earthquakes that occur in Taiwan centered in this area.</P>
      <P>"It might be too early panic simply because the Sanchiao fault has been found to
be longer than expected, " said Kuo Kai-wen, director of CWB's Seismology
Center.</P>

      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan said Tuesday that the government will help local 3D
animation and online game companies to resolve the issue of unfair trade
treatment with China, expand their international market and nurture more talent.</P>
      <P>Liu made the remarks in a statement released after he led a group of officials
on a visit to four major local animation and online game companies earlier in
the day.</P>
      <P>During the visit, Wang Chin-po, president of the online game developer Soft-
World International Corp., told Liu that China imposes many limits on foreign
digital technology products, including those from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>However, Taiwan has opened to similar products from China, Wang said, urging the
government to discuss the issue with its Chinese counterparts in future business
negotiations.</P>
      <P>Liu supported Wang's suggestion and said that the quasi-official Taiwan External
Trade Development Council (TAITRA) will also help raise the international
profile of Taiwan's 3D animation products.</P>
      <P>In addition, Wang called for a resumption of tax incentives, which were canceled
in 2007, for local game companies and continuous implementation of existing
preferential measures.</P>
      <P>Acknowledging  the suggestions,  Liu said  the government's incentive measures
will advance with time to better suit local companies' needs.</P>
      <P>According to Wang, the online game industry has created the most successful
business model in the digital content industry and he described it as "the
locomotive engine" for the industry.</P>
      <P>It is also the industry that generates the highest production value in the
Chinese-speaking market, Wang noted.</P>
      <P>He continued that last year, Taiwan's online game industry created NT$10 billion
(about US$318 million) in output value, while relevant business opportunities
amounted to NT$50 billion.</P>
      <P>During a visit to CGCG, a local 3D animation studio that has many international
clients, CGCG Chairman Shih Wen-hsiang told the premier that it is difficult to
find animation talent and that there is a lack of quality local talent.</P>
      <P>In response, Liu said he will ask relevant government agencies to review school

      <P>Three orphan sisters flew Wednesday to the United States to begin new lives with
their adoptive parents, a couple from Texas who have shown their love for the
disadvantaged by taking them all, despite their ages -- 14, 16 and 17 years old,
respectively.</P>
      <P>A day earlier, Shiao-hua, Shiao-yi and Shiao-ping (all nicknames) spent their
last night at the privately run Chung Yi Orphanage in Taipei City, which they
have called home for 10 years since their mother died.</P>
      <P>According to orphanage staff, Shiao-hua is the eldest and will soon turn 18. She
has attended to her younger sisters since their mother got sick, they said,
noting that she continued to do so even after they were taken in by the
orphanage.</P>
      <P>Shiao-hua did not want to be separated from her sisters, even though it would
have been much easier for them to be adopted by different families. She had even
said she "would rather die than be separated from her sisters, " they recalled.</P>
      <P>Because of Shiao-hua's insistence, the three sisters stayed at the orphanage
until George Lee and his wife Deborah received an e-mail that had been doing the
rounds on the Internet, the Chung Yi workers said.</P>
      <P>George, a Taiwan-born American, said at the orphanage that he and his wife spent
just five minutes discussing the issue before deciding to adopt the trio.</P>
      <P>"Society needs more public welfare and good hearts, not just indices suggesting
economic growth, " he said. Besides, he went on, their own children have all

    <TEXT>
      <P>Addiction to cold bottled drinks on hot days is a bad habit in terms of both
enviornmental protection and health, warned an official from the John Tung
Foundation Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Drinking and consuming excessive amounts of bottled cold drinks, particularly
purchasing them from convenient stores, will only cause those franchises to
consume more electricity in order to boost sales -- which is eventually
detrimental to the environment, said Hsu Hui-yu, a foundation official in charge
of nutrition and related affairs.</P>
      <P>The John Tung Foundation is an anti-smoking group seen as one of the most
effective nonprofit lobbying groups in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Hsu quoted tallies from the Ministry of Economic Affairs as indicating that
electricity  consumed by refrigeration  storage facilities in Taiwan's
convenient stores constitutes about one-third of all energy consumed by the
stores.</P>
      <P>The refrigerators in each of the 8,120 convenient stores nationwide consume an
average of 51,000 kwhs each month, and as a result, the carbon dioxide that is
discharged during the generation of the electricity consumed by all of the
convenient stores in Taiwan each month could equal as much as the carbon dioxide
taken in by 950,000 full-grown trees, Hsu said.</P>
      <P>Aware that sales of cold drinks and dairy products have been one of the culprits
of increased energy consumption, many advanced countries have taken measures to
reduce electricity comsumption by related industries and services, Hsu related.</P>
      <P>The United Kingdom is promoting the sale of preserved milk to replace fresh
milk, as storage of the latter consumes more energy, Hsu said, adding that most
of the soft drinks in Germany, Portugal and Spain are sold and stored at room
temperature. He also noted that Wal-Mart Stores in the United States require its
suppliers to provide the amount of greenhouse gas emission for each of their
products.</P>
      <P>The UK's Tesco grocery franchise has promised that all of the over 80,000
products on their stores' shelves will carry tags telling how much carbon
dioxide emission is involved in producing and marketing the products, Hsu added.</P>
      <P>"For the part of the consumers, they can help reduce energy consumption and
carbon dioxide emission simply by drinking fewer cold bottled drinks," Hsu
reiterated.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  Wu Chien-lung, a doctor of traditional Chinese medicine with Taipei
City Hospital, said he does not think it's smart to consume cold drinks or ice
excessively in the summertime.</P>
      <P>"Gulping icy drinks probably cools people down and delights them on hot days,
but people with weak stomachs could suffer diarrhea, those with weak kidneys
could develop dydroncus, some could develop skin rashes, and black eyes and
nasal problems could become worse after people drink their fill of cool
liquids," Wu said.</P>
      <P>Those who are on a diet should refrain from bingeing on cold drinks,  as nearly
all of those products could affect their metabolism if consumed excessively, he
added.</P>

      <P>The output  value  of the local telecommunication industry in the second quarter
of this year reached NT$194.7 billion (US$6.20 billion), representing a 25
percent annual increase, according to a report released Wednesday by the
Industrial Economics and Knowledge Center (IEK).</P>
      <P>Of the amount, overseas production accounted for 70.4 percent of the total
output value of the quarter, mostly from plants in China, the report shows.</P>
      <P>The output value of the first six months was registered at NT$369.7 billion, up
17.3 percent from the year-earlier level.</P>
      <P>According to Hsu Ai-ti, an analyst at the center, a drop in the mobile phone
sector last year due to Motorola's business downturn was stopped this year
thanks to manufacturers' strategies of having dispersed clients and developing
private brands.</P>

      <P>The Taipei County Police Bureau has launched a five-month campaign to wipe out
rampant car theft and home burglary as part of its effort to improve social
order in the county in northern Taiwan, a spokesman said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>According to the spokesman, the campaign, which kicked off Aug. 12 and is slated
to run through Jan. 11, 2009, is aimed at cracking down on theft rings that
steal cars and motorcycles,  and those that break into private homes to steal
from or rob them. Vehicle theft and home burglary are the most common complaints
of local residents,  he noted.</P>
      <P>In a bid urging local police authorities to actively handle such cases reported
by the public, the bureau will each month award a small colored flag to the best
and the worst police precincts in the county, which will be divided into two
groups, depending on their workload, he said.</P>
      <P>The best-performing police precinct from each group will be awarded a red flag,
while the worst-performing precinct will be given a purple one, he explained.
Inspection unit chiefs at all of the county's police stations are required to
place the flag they are given by the bureau on their desks to allow the public
to immediately learn of their performance, he added.</P>
      <P>According to the spokesman, there are 15 police precincts and more than 100
substations throughout Taipei County.</P>
      <P>He denied allegations that exhibiting the flag would add more pressure to local
police officers. Rather, he said, the measure is designed to boost their sense
of honor and responsibility to help build a safe and sound living environment
for local citizens.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOFA to check if Singapore has passed information on money-laundering</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Wednesday that it will conduct a
probe into reports that Singapore provided information about suspected money-
laundering by members of the former first family as early as last year.</P>
      <P>Foreign Affairs Minister Francisco H.L. Ou made the remarks amid reports  by
China Times,  a local newspaper,  that Singapore authorities alerted Taiwan in
March 2007.</P>
      <P>Reports said former first lady Wu Shu-jen transferred money to a bank account of
her brother, Wu Ching-mao, in Singapore last year after Chao Chien-ming, former
president Chen Shui-bian's son-in-law, was indicted for insider trading in a
corruption scandal in 2006.</P>
      <P>Wu Ching-mao then closed his bank account and transferred the money to a Swiss
bank account under the name of Huang Jui-ching, Chen Shui-bian's daughter-in-
law.</P>
      <P>Due to the abnormal flow of the funds, Singapore alerted Taiwan via diplomatic
channels and the Egmont Group, an international anti-money laundering
organization, according to reports.</P>
      <P>Ou said the Kuomintang administration was inaugurated on May 20, and the
ministry only received a request for judicial assistance from Switzerland last
month.</P>
      <P>Asked if some officials have withheld information about the suspected money-
laundering by the members of the former first family, Ou said "the ministry will
be able to track it down if there were files."</P>
      <P>Vice Foreign Affairs Minister Javier Ching-shan Hou also said the ministry will
"embark on a probe."</P>
      <P>Until now, the authorities have believed that a document sent by the Egmont
Group to the Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau (MJIB) in January of this
year was the first to blow the whistle on the suspected money-laundering. In the
document the Egmont Group detailed  the status of bank accounts created by
members of then-President Chen's family in other countries, including the United
States, the Cayman Islands, Singapore and Switzerland.</P>
      <P>Yeh Sheng-mao, former MJIB head who is a protege of Chen Shui-bian, admitted
last weekend that he didn't give the document to State Public Prosecutor-General
Chen Tsung-ming due to "negligence" because he was busy with his own retirement
(in July).</P>
      <P>Yeh is under investigation and he could be charged with obstruction of official
duties under the Criminal Code.</P>
      <P>A local magazine, Next, cited the contents of the document, reporting last week
that Huang Jui-ching had laundered money for the former first family by secretly
wiring NT$300 million overseas in 2006, after the exposure of the "state affairs
fund" embezzlement case implicating Chen and his wife Wu Shu-jen.</P>
      <P>Chen Shui-bian was forced to call a news conference last Thursday in which he
admitted that his wife had wired abroad an unspecified amount of money that he
had received as campaign contributions.</P>
      <P>Chen confessed that he did not faithfully account for the election campaign
expenses for his two mayoral elections and two presidential elections between
1993 and 2004, but claimed he was unaware that the surplus funds were wired
abroad by his wife until early this year.</P>
      <P>However, he rejected allegation that the funds wired overseas could be connected
to his "state affairs funds" embezzlement case and a recent scandal involving a
botched attempt to win Papua New Guinea as a diplomatic ally.</P>

      <P>Former Minister of Economic Affairs Chao Yao-tung -- recognized for his role in
helping Taiwan to become one of Asia's "four little dragons" in the 1980s --
died Wednesday at a hostel for the elderly in Taipei at the age of 93.</P>
      <P>He is survived by his son and daughter-in-law, who were with him when he passed
away peacefully.</P>
      <P>Caretakers at the hostel -- the Kang Ning Serviced Apartments -- said Chao had
suffered from amnesia in his final years and that he apparently died of organ
failure.</P>
      <P>Chao held a master's degree from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. From
1949 to 1970, he served as an engineer, manager in charge of design and vice
chairman of several textile companies.</P>
      <P>From 1971 to 1981, he served as president and later as board chairman of state-
owned China Steel Corp. in the southern port city of Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>His unique management style and ability to boost the morale of the workforce
turned the government enterprise into a huge success. As a compliment, he was
given the nickname "Iron Head Chao" and was considered the driving power behind
China Steel.</P>
      <P>In 1984, he was appointed minister of economic affairs -- a post he held for
four years. His contribution to Taiwan's economic development during these years
earned himself a niche at the same level as three of his predecessors -- Yin
Chung-jung, Li Kuo-ting and Sun Yun-suan -- who are remembered for creating
Taiwan's economic miracle.</P>
      <P>From 1984 to 1988, Chao served as chairman of the Council for Economic Planning
and Development (CEPD), Taiwan's highest economic planning agency.</P>
      <P>After retiring from the CEPD at the age of 73, he became a national policy
adviser for the Presidential Office -- a post in which he served until 1999.</P>

      <P>Ruling Kuomintang (KMT) Vice Chairman Chiang Pin-kung will lead a delegation on
a visit to Japan Aug. 25-27 in another effort to assure Japan that Taiwan does
not favor its relations with China over those with Japan.</P>
      <P>It will be the second delegation from Taiwan to visit Japan within a month.
Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng returned from there Aug. 13, where he
tried to clarify Taiwan's firm stance on its friendly ties with Japan.</P>
      <P>Since the KMT took the reins of government May 20, Taiwan's efforts to warm up
relations with China have prompted Japan to express concern that Taiwan-Japan
relations might deteriorate.</P>
      <P>In addition, Japan was surprised by the Taiwanese government's tough stance over
a recent fishing boat collision incident near the disputed Tiaoyutai Islands
that are claimed by Taiwan, Japan and China.</P>
      <P>A Taiwanese fishing boat sank after colliding with a Japanese patrol vessel in
June, sparking a diplomatic spat.</P>
      <P>Taiwan maintained solid relations with Japan under Taiwan's previous  eight-year
Democratic  Progressive  Party  (DPP) administration.</P>
      <P>In recent years, Japan has offered a number of preferential policies to Taiwan,
including visa-free privileges for Taiwanese tourists.</P>
      <P>To allay Japan's concerns, President Ma Ying-jeou has repeatedly said that
thawing Taiwan-China  relations will not affect the friendship between Taiwan
and Japan.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Lee Chia-chin, a member of the delegation, told CNA that it is
appropriate for Chiang to lead the delegation.</P>
      <P>He noted that Chiang also serves as the chairman of the quasi-official  Straits
Exchange Foundation  (SEF) ,  which is responsible for handling relations with
China in the absence of formal ties between Taipei and Beijing.</P>
      <P>During his visit, Chiang will represent Ma, to make it clear to Japan that
Taiwan's foreign policy does not completely lean toward China and that Ma is not
against Japan, Lee noted.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lee suggested that John C.T. Feng, a retired diplomat who was tapped
as Taiwan's representative to Japan a day earlier, visit Japan with the
delegation to learn more about Japan's Diet and political situation.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, the delegation has planned the visit at the invitation of the

      <P>A former military prison and courthouse located in Taipei that is now the
Jingmei Human Rights Memorial Park has been transformed into an artistic
rehearsal space, giving grace to the old compound that was once used to
incarcerate political prisoners.</P>
      <P>At present, the world-renowned Cloud Gate Dance Theatre is rehearsing its latest
work, "Whisper of Flowers, " for the world premiere in Taiwan Sept. 12, making
the once-grim detention center resound to the cello music of Bach.</P>
      <P>Since a fire destroyed their previous base in the Taipei County village of Bali
in February, the dancers have been using the performance hall at the Jingmei
Human Rights Memorial Park to rehearse.</P>
      <P>As rehearsal places are in short supply in Taiwan, Lin Hwai-min, Cloud Gate's
founder and choreographer, has suggested that the Council for Cultural Affairs
(CCA) designate the memorial park hall as a permanent rehearsal space for
artists, a proposal that was accepted by former CCA Minister Wang Tuoh.</P>
      <P>"The government has not really made overall plans for domestic cultural
development, " said Lin. "Can we win at the Olympic Games if we training just
before the events?" he asked rhetorically.</P>
      <P>The Jingmei Human Rights Memorial Park, located in southern Taipei, was
originally a facility where political prisoners were tried and incarcerated by
the authoritarian Kuomintang regime during the martial law period from
1949-1987.</P>
      <P>Many politicians in the then-opposition forces served terms in the military
prison, such as former Vice President Annette Lu and incumbent Kaohsiung Mayor
Chen Chu.</P>
      <P>In 2002, the CCA designated the desolate compound a historic landmark and
started construction of the human rights memorial park, which was formally
opened to the public Dec. 12 last year.</P>
      <P>It is Taiwan's second human rights park. The first one was established on Green
Island, 33 km off Taiwan's southeastern coast, where political prisoners were

      <P>The ruling Kuomintang (KMT) will submit a draft bill aimed at punishing
government officials who cannot explain the origin of their suspicious  assets
for screening  in the legislature's next session, a KMT official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Lin I-shih, director of the KMT's Policy Coordination Committee and also a
lawmaker, said that to meet high public expectations that corrupt officials will
be effectively penalized, the ruling party will work out the draft by late
August to allow it to be reviewed as a priority bill by lawmakers in the coming
session, which usually begins in early September.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, the KMT will mainly adopt a version drawn up by the Ministry
of Justice as an initial version of the bill.</P>
      <P>He made the comments while answering questions from reporters at a time when a
high-profile money-laundering scandal embroiling former President Chen Shui-bian
and his family has caught the attention of the public since it was brought to
light last weekend.</P>
      <P>Lin said his party is now poised to push the bill through the legislature as
soon as possible by listing it as the top priority issue for discussion on the
agenda of the new legislative session.</P>
      <P>The KMT has come under strong attack by some media outlets that have blamed the
party for the long-delayed passage of such a bill, as it now controls more than
two-thirds of the 113 seats in the Legislative Yuan.</P>

hospital, encouraging patients waiting for kidney transplants to keep their
hopes up.</P>
      <P>Lee Rou-yi, who is now third-year student at the Chung Shan Medical University

kidney to become available.</P>
      <P>"If there is a chance for a kidney transplant, don't let it slip by, " said Lee
Wednesday to an 18-year-old boy who is awaiting a kidney at the hospital.</P>
      <P>Lee said she was diagnosed with urine occult blood when she was in sixth grade.
However, she did not take the diagnosis seriously until constant poor appetite
and bloody urine led to a kidney biopsy and the discovery of renal failure.</P>
      <P>Despite this, she refused dialysis until one evening six years ago when she
suffered an emergency and was rushed to hospital for the dialysis treatment.</P>

will begin their study at National University of Tainan's Graduate Institute of
Taiwan Culture in southern Taiwan during the new academic year.</P>
      <P>The father, a respected elder tribesman, told CNA that he took the entrance
admission exam for three consecutive years and finally passed it this year.</P>
      <P>He served as the chief executive of officer of the Cultural and Art Development

historical documents.</P>
      <P>The Tsou, numbering more than 6,300, are distributed in central and southern

    <HEADLINE>Consumer group urges specifying degradable levels of toilet paper</HEADLINE>

08/20/08  22:04:00

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Consumers' Foundation suggested Wednesday that the government develop a new
national standard that clearly categorizes biodegradable levels of toilet paper
and facial tissues and that all manufacturers strengthen labeling on their
products, including providing biodegradable level.</P>
      <P>According to a survey conducted by the foundation between Aug. 12-17, of 1,340
respondents, 77 percent of the respondents said they favored adopting the
practice of flushing away used toilet paper, with 55 percent of those proponents
saying they already did so, and another 23 percent of the respondents expressing
their opposition to doing so.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted in light of the controversy over the appropriateness of
urging people to flush their used toilet paper instead of placing it in waste
bins as a way to save on disposal costs.</P>
      <P>As toilet paper is made mainly from wood pulp, it breaks down easily in water,
while facial tissues are made not only out of wood pulp but also other paper
additives--such as paper wet-strength agents--which make it difficult to break
down, said Wu Chia-cheng, a foundation member and professor in the Department of
Chemistry at National Taiwan Normal University.</P>
      <P>Generally speaking, used toilet paper can be disposed of by flushing, Wu said,
but given the fact that it is difficult to differentiate toilet paper from
facial tissues by their package appearances, manufacturers of the products
should improve packaging and labeling of their products to highlight the
differences between the two types of paper products and enable consumers to
distinguish the difference easily, he added.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's household sewer connection rate, as of April, had reached only 18.38
percent, Wu said, adding that toilet paper should only be flushed down in areas
where toilets are connected to sewage treatment systems or where sceptic tanks
are emptied frequently, in order to avoid negatively impacting the environment.</P>
      <P>Toilet paper in many other countries is made from short-fiber pulp and free from
bactericides, as well as whitening and bleaching agents, Wu noted. He said this
kind of paper is the main food source for microscopic organisms that can aid in
pollution control by metabolizing organic matter in sewage and help with
environmental protection.</P>
      <P>He added that the Bureau of Standards, Metrology and Inspection, under the
Ministry of Economic Affairs, should formulate criteria for the classification
of degradable levels of toilet paper products so as to help consumers
distinguish products that can be flushed in toilets from those that cannot.</P>

      <P>The occurrence rate and mortality rate of prostate cancer among Taiwanese males
has increased over the past few years, a doctor at the Department of Health's
(DOH's) Keelung Hospital in northern Taiwan said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Hsu Wen-chang, a urologist at the hospital, said that according to DOH
statistics, prostate cancer ranked No. 10 as cause of death in 1994 and No. 7 in
2001, accounting for for 2.4 percent and 3.6 percent of the total deaths,
respectively.</P>
      <P>Hsu urged men aged over 50 years of age to have rectal touch and prostate
specific antigen (PSA) tests annually for early detection and treatment, which
can increase a five-year survival rate to 90 percent.</P>
      <P>The cause of prostate cancer is still unclear. However, age, heredity and diet
are viewed as important risk factors, said Hsu, adding that men with a family
history of prostate cancer should undergo examinations from the age of 40.</P>
      <P>According to Hsu, symptoms of early-stage prostate cancer include micturition,
nocturia and small urinary stream due to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) .
Symptoms of the later stages include bone pain or paralysis of the lower limbs
due to metastasis, he added.</P>
      <P>Hsu noted that rectal touch, prostate specific antigen (PSA) test, and prostate
ultrasound (TRUS) are the current diagnostic methods,  with treatments
including surgery,  hormone therapy, radiation therapy and chemotherapy.</P>
      <P>Hsu said an early stage prostate cancer patient who undergoes laparoscopic

highest mountain lake at the altitude of 3,310 meters -- with 30 kg of gear on

      <P>The game against Canada lasted 12 innings, as a 5-5 tie at the end of the ninth
required extended play.</P>
      <P>Chinese Taipei earned one run in the top of the first, but starting pitcher Chen

      <P>Pitcher Chang Chia-chih took over from Ni in the bottom of the 12th and together

    <TEXT>
      <P>The rim of Typhoon Nuri had reached waters off Eluanpi on the southernmost tip
of Taiwan late Wednesday, but unless the medium typhoon diverts sharply
northward, the Central Weather Bureau (CWB) will not issue a land warning for
the storm, weathermen said late that evening.</P>
      <P>The CWB issued a sea warning for Nuri the previous morning, but weathermen said
the typhoon took a more northerly track than originally expected, probably
because of the influence of the area's topography. As a result, its strength is
expected to weaken and unless the typhoon take a more northerly course, no land
warning will be issued.</P>
      <P>At 8 p.m. Wednesday, Nuri was centered 260 kilometers south of Eluanpi, packing
maximum sustained winds of 144 km and moving northwesterly at 15 kph toward
Taiwan-controlled Dongsha Island (Pratas) in the South China Sea and the
southern part of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Chen Yi-liang, a section chief at the CWB's Weather Forecast Center, said if
Nuri takes a more northerly course, the bureau will not rule out the possibility
of issuing a land warning for the typhoon.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, Nuri will be closest to Taiwan from midnight Wednesday
through Thursday. Ships navigating or operating in the Bashi Channel, waters
surrounding the Dongsha Islands and the Taiwan Strait should keep alert, Chen
said, adding that residents in eastern and southeastern Taiwan and Hengchun area
as well as in mountainous regions in southern Taiwan should take precautionary
measures against downpours.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Consumer group urges specifying degradable levels of toilet paper</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Consumers' Foundation suggested Wednesday that the government develop a new
national standard that clearly categorizes biodegradable levels of toilet paper
and facial tissues and that all manufacturers strengthen labeling on their
products, including providing biodegradable level.</P>
      <P>According to a survey conducted by the foundation between Aug. 12-17, of 1,340
respondents, 77 percent of the respondents said they favored adopting the
practice of flushing away used toilet paper, with 55 percent of those proponents
saying they already did so, and another 23 percent of the respondents expressing
their opposition to doing so.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted in light of the controversy over the appropriateness of
urging people to flush their used toilet paper instead of placing it in waste
bins as a way to save on disposal costs.</P>
      <P>As toilet paper is made mainly from wood pulp, it breaks down easily in water,
while facial tissues are made not only out of wood pulp but also other paper
additives--such as paper wet-strength agents--which make it difficult to break
down, said Wu Chia-cheng, a foundation member and professor in the Department of
Chemistry at National Taiwan Normal University.</P>
      <P>Generally speaking, used toilet paper can be disposed of by flushing, Wu said,
but given the fact that it is difficult to differentiate toilet paper from
facial tissues by their package appearances, manufacturers of the products
should improve packaging and labeling of their products to highlight the
differences between the two types of paper products and enable consumers to
distinguish the difference easily, he added.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's household sewer connection rate, as of April, had reached only 18.38
percent, Wu said, adding that toilet paper should only be flushed down in areas
where toilets are connected to sewage treatment systems or where sceptic tanks
are emptied frequently, in order to avoid negatively impacting the environment.</P>
      <P>Toilet paper in many other countries is made from short-fiber pulp and free from
bactericides, as well as whitening and bleaching agents, Wu noted. He said this
kind of paper is the main food source for microscopic organisms that can aid in
pollution control by metabolizing organic matter in sewage and help with
environmental protection.</P>
      <P>He added that the Bureau of Standards, Metrology and Inspection, under the
Ministry of Economic Affairs, should formulate criteria for the classification
of degradable levels of toilet paper products so as to help consumers
distinguish products that can be flushed in toilets from those that cannot.</P>

      <P>The occurrence rate and mortality rate of prostate cancer among Taiwanese males
has increased over the past few years, a doctor at the Department of Health's
(DOH's) Keelung Hospital in northern Taiwan said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Hsu Wen-chang, a urologist at the hospital, said that according to DOH
statistics, prostate cancer ranked No. 10 as cause of death in 1994 and No. 7 in
2001, accounting for for 2.4 percent and 3.6 percent of the total deaths,
respectively.</P>
      <P>Hsu urged men aged over 50 years of age to have rectal touch and prostate
specific antigen (PSA) tests annually for early detection and treatment, which
can increase a five-year survival rate to 90 percent.</P>
      <P>The cause of prostate cancer is still unclear. However, age, heredity and diet
are viewed as important risk factors, said Hsu, adding that men with a family
history of prostate cancer should undergo examinations from the age of 40.</P>
      <P>According to Hsu, symptoms of early-stage prostate cancer include micturition,
nocturia and small urinary stream due to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) .
Symptoms of the later stages include bone pain or paralysis of the lower limbs
due to metastasis, he added.</P>
      <P>Hsu noted that rectal touch, prostate specific antigen (PSA) test, and prostate
ultrasound (TRUS) are the current diagnostic methods,  with treatments
including surgery,  hormone therapy, radiation therapy and chemotherapy.</P>
      <P>Hsu said an early stage prostate cancer patient who undergoes laparoscopic
radical prostatectomy now has a much better chance of recovery.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's national baseball team pocketed its second victory Wednesday in the
2009 Beijing Olympic Games, defeating Canada 6-5 in a run-off competition.</P>
      <P>With a record of two wins and four losses, the Taiwanese team, officially called
Chinese Taipei, placed fifth in the tournament.</P>
      <P>The game against Canada lasted 12 innings, as a 5-5 tie at the end of the ninth
required extended play.</P>
      <P>Chinese Taipei earned one run in the top of the first, but starting pitcher Chen
Wei-yin allowed the opposing team two runs in the same inning.</P>
      <P>In the top of the second, Chinese Taipei scored four more runs, followed by one
run by Canada for a 5-3 lead by Chinese Taipei.</P>
      <P>Chinese Taipei's starting pitcher was relieved by Pan Wei-lun in the fourth
inning after Canada scored another run. Pan pitched three- and-a-half innings
before being replaced by Ni Fu-teh in the seventh when Canada's Stubby Clapp hit
a solo home run for a 5-5 tie, which continued until the end of the ninth,
requiring a run-off.</P>
      <P>Ni pitched four-and-a-half innings until the 11th, allowing Canada no runs,
while Canada also held its line until the 12th, when Chinese Taipei hitter
Chiang Chih-hsien contributed a timely hit -- with the first and second bases
loaded -- to send a teammate back to home base for a 6-5 lead.</P>
      <P>Pitcher Chang Chia-chih took over from Ni in the bottom of the 12th and together
they struck out three Canadian hitters, ending the match 6-5.</P>
      <P>In its previous matches, Chinese Taipei won only its first match against the
Netherlands 5-0. It lost the four subsequent games to Japan 1-6, to Cuba 0-1, to
South Korea 8-9 and to the United States 2-4, dashing the team's hopes of coming

    <HEADLINE>MOFA completes internal investigation of ex-president case</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Thursday that it has completed its
internal investigation of the handling of money-laundering allegations involving
former President Chen Shui-bian and will submit its report to its disciplinary
committee.</P>
      <P>"The internal investigation found that the related officials were indeed guilty
of dereliction of duty, therefore, Foreign Minister Francisco H.L. Ou has given
instructions for the case to be sent to the ministry's merit evaluation and
disciplinary committee, " said MOFA spokesman Henry Chen at a regular press
briefing.</P>
      <P>"The case will also be referred to the Control Yuan, as will Taiwan's
representative to Switzerland, Kuanping George Liu, " the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>Liu, who tendered his resignation July 29, is now in the process of handing over
his duties, as his newly appointed replacement Hsieh Fa-dah prepares to assume
office.</P>
      <P>Since Liu was a political appointee, his role in the case will be determined by
the Control Yuan, the MOFA spokesman said, but he declined  to reveal  how many
MOFA officials  had come under investigation.</P>
      <P>According to Henry Chen, Ou was enraged at the fact that foreign ministry
officials had not been watchful enough, as alertness and a sense of judgment are
emphasized in the basic training of career diplomats.</P>
      <P>"We think they were not alert enough, but we do not think they deliberately
procrastinated on the matter, " Henry Chen said in response to reporters'
questions on whether the delivery of a letter from the Swiss Confederations
Department of Justice seeking Taiwan's assistance in probing the case had been
delayed.</P>
      <P>The letter, dated June 16, was received by the representative office in early
July, but staffers there allegedly sat on it for nearly a month before
forwarding it to the MOFA, which later sent it to the Ministry of Justice.</P>
      <P>Chen said the foreign ministry will also prepare a statement for all its
representative  offices and embassies  to explain the money-laundering scandal,
in a bid to protect the nation's image.</P>
      <P>Foreign Minister Ou has instructed us to formulate a single statement for damage
control, as our national image has been marred in the international media's
reports on the case," the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>"We will direct all our embassies and representative offices to use the uniform
statement to explain the matter, " he said. "The foreign ministry does not want
to see the country's image keep being hurt."</P>
      <P>Former President Chen and his wife Wu Shu-jen have been listed as suspects in a
high-profile money laundering case and have been barred from leaving the
country.</P>
      <P>Other suspects in the case are Wu's elder brother Wu Ching-mao, who has also
been prohibited from leaving the country, and the ex-president's  son Chen Chih-
chung  and daughter-in-law  Huang Jui-ching, who have left the country but would
have to report their movements if they return to Taiwan, according to
prosecutors.</P>
      <P>Chen admitted last Thursday that he did not faithfully report the election
campaign expenses from his two mayoral elections and two presidential elections
between 1993 and 2004, but claimed he was unaware, until early this year, that
the balance of the funds had been wired abroad by his wife.</P>
      <P>He rejected the idea that the money wired overseas could be connected to a
"state affairs fund" embezzlement case and a botched attempt by Taiwan to win
Papua New Guinea as a diplomatic ally.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A set of refined cattle embryo transplant techniques has helped to raise the
pregnancy rates among sexually mature cows and to increase their milk
production, according to the government-run Livestock Research Institute (LRI).</P>
      <P>The techniques were first developed by foreign animal husbandry experts, and the
institute later improved and tested the effects in Taiwan, said researchers at
the institute, an affiliate of the Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture.</P>
      <P>Yang Der-uei, an assistant researcher at the institute, explained that the
technique involves collecting ova from cows during the cooler seasons -- usually
November to April in Taiwan -- and transplanting the artificially fertilized
embryos into the same cows or others in summer.</P>
      <P>"The reason for separating the ovum collection and embryo implantation is that
milk cows tend to have lower conception rates in summer, " said Yang. "Through
the help of in-vitro fertilization and cryostorage of early-stage embryos,
conception rates in summer can be raised by 17.2 percent to 36.4 percent."</P>
      <P>Milk cows have to remain in a state of pregnancy in order to continuously
produce milk, thus higher pregnancy rates mean higher milk production
capability, said one researcher.</P>
      <P>The LRI said it has conducted two stages of technology transfer during the past
two years and the results have shown some promising signs. The institute hopes
that the techniques can be transferred to ordinary dairy farmers in the coming
years, according to an LRI official.</P>

      <P>A total of 24,452 children are expected to be admitted into elementary schools
in Taipei City this fall, nearly 4,000 less than the previous year, the

      <P>The number of 2008 first graders marked the greatest decline in this group in 20
years, the Education Department said.</P>
      <P>Given the declining number of pre-school children, the number of first grade

official said.</P>
      <P>"Only 12 elementary schools around Taipei City are expected to have full
recruitment this year," said the official.</P>
      <P>Attributing the obvious decline in enrollments mainly to the country's declining
birth rate in recent years, the official said the figure is forecast to drop
further next year.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, he said, declining enrollment means that there is a need for fewer
first-graded teachers, whose numbers are expected to decrease by 226 citywide
this year.</P>
      <P>To tackle the issue, the city's Education Department has several resolutions,
including cutting the number of first-grade classes and helping "out of work"
teachers  to become on-campus  academic consultants or research teachers.</P>
      <P>As to whether elementary schools in Taipei City should be merged or closed, the
official said it is too early at this stage to speculate on such questions.</P>

      <P>Feng-lu Milee Lee, a Taiwanese artist living and working in Birmingham, will
launch an exhibition Aug. 27 at the New Art Gallery Walsall in central Britain,
under the sponsorship of the Arts Council of England.</P>
      <P>Lee, one of five artists and the only non-native English one to receive the
council's grants to artists this summer, said Wednesday that each recipient will
be givenG5,000 and the option to choose a sponsored institution that offers
workshops, exhibition facilities and other assistance for implementing art
projects.</P>
      <P>The program is aimed at encouraging the creation of art, bringing art into
communities, encouraging the public to get involved in art activities and
promoting the acceptance of all forms of art.</P>
      <P>Lee, who has picked the New Art Gallery Walsall as the venue for her "Sunshine
Mountain" exhibition, said she has already installed three round pieces of turf
enclosed by white fences in the art gallery. This is to create an area with the
best mountain views from any modern downtown property, which would allow
visitors feel close to nature and to rest on the turf, she added.</P>
      <P>During the exhibition, Lee will portray a sheep in a range of different
situations, dressed in costumes she created, as part of her live art show.</P>
      <P>Helen Jones, curator of the Art Gallery Walsall, praised Lee for creating a new
image for the gallery by putting fresh turf in the building. She said Lee's
innovative ideas would allow visitors to enjoy cozy afternoons, to relax and
view the exhibitions in the gallery.</P>
      <P>The 33-year-old Lee is an outstanding new emerging artist from Taiwan who holds
a bachelor's degree in Fine Arts from National Kaohsiung Normal University in
southern Taiwan and a master's degree in Fine Arts from Birmingham Institute of
Art and Design in the UK.</P>
      <P>Lee works in various media, often incorporating installation, performance and
video works. She has an international reputation, having exhibited extensively
throughout the UK, Taiwan, the U.S. and Middle East.</P>
      <P>Lee was selected as a member of a residency program in Berlin in 2007 which was
funded by the Arts Council England.</P>
      <P>One of her projects was included in the 2005 annual Kaohsiung Fine Arts Museum's
Intertidal Zone Art Monitoring Station. Another of her projects was nominated as
one of the top five art shows in the Taihsin Arts Award Exhibition in Taiwan in
2006.</P>
      <P>Lee obtained an artist residency in Mount Zionin Jerusalem, Israel in 2001 in an
artist exchange program between Taipei and Jerusalem, after winning the
prestigious Taipei Prize 2000 in Taiwan.</P>

      <P>Notebook computers and personal digital assistants (PDAs) remain the two devices
most commonly used by Taiwan Internet users to go online wirelessly, according
to the results of a survey released Thursday by the Taiwan Network Information
Center (TWNIC).</P>
      <P>The places most commonly used to connect to the Internet wirelessly were coffee
shops, after homes and offices, the results showed.</P>
      <P>The survey on the status of wireless Internet use in Taiwan was conducted via
telephone interviews between April 23 and May 8 polling 1,417 adults as well as
online questionnaires of 4,563 others between March 13 and June 10.</P>
      <P>The survey revealed that 79.31 percent of online respondents have accessed the
Internet wirelessly, with 72.21 percent having done so in the past six months.</P>
      <P>Among telephone respondents, 42.56 percent have experience using wireless
services, with 36.33 percent having done so in the past six months.</P>
      <P>The most commonly used functions of wireless Internet services cited by
respondents were searching information, browsing information and Web pages, and
sending and receiving e-mails.</P>
      <P>Unstable or poor Internet connections were the most common problems encountered
by wireless Internet users.</P>
      <P>While more than 60 percent of the telephone respondents who have used wireless
Internet services expressed satisfaction with the quality of wireless
connections, only 26 percent of the online respondents were satisfied.</P>
      <P>When asked about their reasons for not using wireless Internet services, the 58
percent of telephone respondents who have never tried the services said there is
no need for them to use the services, and 43 percent of online respondents said
they seldom use the Internet out of their homes or offices.</P>
      <P>However, if this group of respondents goes online wirelessly in the future, they
will most likely do so in coffee shops, restaurants, MRT stations, airports,
train stations and homes, according to the results.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou has said that his brief transit stops in the United
States, during his just-concluded state visit to Latin America in mid-August,
created opportunities for dialogue between Taiwan and America despite receiving
little media coverage.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks Wednesday at a meeting with Eliot Engel, a member of the
United States House of Representatives, at the Presidential Office. Engel is the
chairman of the U.S. House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on the Western
Hemisphere.</P>
      <P>The main purpose of Ma's Latin America visit was to attend the Aug. 15
inauguration ceremony of Paraguayan President Fernando Lugo and the inauguration
ceremony of re-elected Dominican Republic President Leonel Fernandez on Aug. 16.</P>
      <P>During his visit, Ma made a low profile transit stop, ahead of his six-day trip
through Latin America, in Los Angeles on Aug. 12 and a second one in San
Francisco on Aug. 17. He returned to Taiwan on Aug. 19.</P>
      <P>According to Ma, he contacted 31 U.S. senators and congressmen during the two
stops. He said he exchanged opinions with eight of them in person and the other
23 over the telephone.</P>
      <P>Engel was one of the congressmen with whom Ma spoke over the telephone. The
discussion with Engel on the phone was quite pleasant, leaving a deep
impression, Ma said.</P>
      <P>At Wednesday's meeting, Ma expressed gratitude to Engel for his long-term
attention to issues regarding Taiwan and his encouragement of Taiwan's  Latin
American  allies to maintain  their strong friendships with the island.</P>
      <P>Ma said Engel is one of Taiwan's best friends in the House of Representatives.</P>
      <P>Engel told Ma that Taiwan has strong economic strength and admirable achievement
in democratization and that he has always had afondness for Taiwan, where local
people moved him with passion and friendliness.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Thursday that so far China has not
yet reacted to Taiwan's latest bid to ask the United Nations to reconsider the
feasibility of Taiwan's meaningful participation in the world body, but added
that the ministry will keep close watch on any response from China.</P>
      <P>At least there has been no reaction by China so far, as the Olympic Games are
still in progress there," said MOFA spokesman Henry Chen at a regular press
briefing in response to a reporter's question. "But we will continue to observe
China's reaction."</P>
      <P>Noting that the foreign ministry has notified its embassies and representative
offices overseas to start promoting the U.N. bid, Chen said the responses from
other countries have been "good so far."</P>
      <P>"Everyone is being very proactive in promoting Taiwan's bid to the governments
in the countries where they are posted, " he said. "That is the main support we
are trying to win."</P>
      <P>Taiwan's bid to enter the United Nations was renewed last Thursday when two of
its diplomatic allies -- St. Vincent and the Grenadines and the Solomon Islands
-- submitted a proposal to the U.N. Secretariat emphasizing the importance of
Taiwan's "meaningful participation" in the world body and of a cross-Taiwan
Strait policy of "reconciliation and truce."</P>
      <P>This marked a fresh approach by the ROC government for the country's admission
to the U.N., under the new presidency of Ma Ying-jeou. The proposal did not
mention the country's attempt to enter the U.N. under the name Taiwan or the
possibility of returning to the U.N. as the ROC.</P>
      <P>The previous Democratic Progressive Party administration, for the first time,
applied in 2007 for Taiwan to join the U.N. as a full member under the name
Taiwan. That proposal did not make the agenda of the U.N. General Assembly.</P>
      <P>Since 1993, Taiwan's supporters have been trying to get the General Assembly to
list the issue on the U.N. agenda, but Beijing's argument that Taiwan is part of
China has prevailed.</P>
      <P>Last Friday was the last day for U.N. members to submit proposals for
consideration as part of the agenda of the General Assembly, which is scheduled
to begin Sep. 16.</P>
      <P>This year, three of Taiwan's diplomatic allies -- Nicaragua, the Solomon Islands
and Honduras -- entered the U.N. General Committee as members, making up the
highest number of Taiwan allies on the committee since 1993. The General
Committee, comprised of delegates from 28 nations, will make the decisions
pertaining to the agenda of the next General Assembly.</P>

Woodcarving Art Festival.</P>
      <P>The eight international artists are: Emil Adamec from the Czech Republic, Mikako
Tomotari from Japan, Yong Tae-don from South Korea, Sigurgeir Thordarson from
Iceland, Yeo Chee Kiong from Singapore, Martyn Barratt from the United Kingdom,

      <P>During the wood carving camp, which will last until Aug. 31, the 14 artists will
demonstrate their carving skills to the public by doing on-site creations in the
plaza of the West Lake Resortopia in Sanyi township.</P>
      <P>The event is sponsored by the Miaoli County International Culture and Tourism
Bureau to promote the exchange of creative ideas in wood carving.</P>
      <P>Miaoli County is well-known for its wood carving industry in Sanyi township. The
craft has existed in Sanyi for more than 100 years. The township's woodcarving
museum serves as a showroom for top Taiwanese wood sculptors who have gained
prominence in Sanyi.</P>
      <P>The government established Kuangsheng Village at Sanyi in 1995 and invited about

    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Justice Wang Ching-feng said Thursday that her ministry has received
a positive response to its requests for judicial assistance from Switzerland and
Singapore in the investigation of a case of suspected money laundering by
members of the former first family.</P>
      <P>The Swiss government expressed the hope that Taiwan would provide more detailed
information, and said that it would assist Taiwan in the probe, Wang said.</P>
      <P>Singapore's  trade representative  to Taiwan  Stanley  Loh, responding to the
request for judicial assistance, also said his country would help Taiwan, she
added.</P>
      <P>Wang also encouraged businesses that had helped in the alleged money laundering
to come forward "to provide clues or information" that would shed light on the
case.</P>
      <P>Wang said Premier Liu Chao-shiuan has issued a directive that the judicial probe
should focus on evidence and proper procedure and that no one should go
unpunished once they are found to have violated the law.</P>
      <P>"If public functionaries violated the law, that will not be condoned. The public
should know that the Cabinet's promise of a clean government is not a slogan,"
Wang quoted Liu as saying.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors  last Saturday  searched former President  Chen Shui-bian's
residence and questioned him and his wife, Wu Shu-jen, about the sources and
flow of sums of money reportedly stashed in overseas banking accounts.</P>
      <P>The former president and his wife, as well as Wu's elder brother Wu Ching-mao,
Chen's son Chen Chih-chung and his daughter-in-law Huang Jui-ching, have been
listed by prosecutors as suspects in the case. The former president, his wife
and Wu Ching-mao have also been barred from leaving the country.</P>
      <P>A local magazine,  based on a report by an international anti-money laundering
organization the Egmont Group, stated last week that Huang Jui-ching had
laundered money for the former first family by secretly wiring NT$300 million
overseas in 2006, after the exposure of a "state affairs fund" embezzlement case
that implicated Chen Shui-bian and his wife.</P>
      <P>The report allegedly detailed the status of bank accounts created by members of
Chen Shui-bian's family in other countries, including the United States, Cayman
Islands, Singapore and Switzerland.</P>
      <P>The former president was forced to admit last Thursday that he did not fully
account for the election campaign expenses for his two mayoral elections and two
presidential elections between 1993 and 2004, but claimed that he was unaware,
until early this year, that the surplus funds had been wired abroad by his wife.</P>
      <P>Chen Shui-bian rejected allegations that the funds wired overseas could be
connected to the "state affairs funds" embezzlement case and a botched attempt
by the Taiwan government to win Papua New Guinea as a diplomatic ally.</P>
      <P>Wu Shu-jen stressed during a search of her residence that all the money
deposited overseas had been obtained legally from four sources -- surplus
campaign funds, Chen Shui-bian's practice as a lawyer before he went into
politics, her own dowry and her investments.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Justice launched an investigation last week after it was
revealed that Swiss authorities had sought Taiwan's assistance in probing a case
of possible money laundering in Switzerland by Chen Chi-chung and Huang Jui-
ching.</P>

      <P>The Kaohsiung city government has stepped up environmental cleanup and
disinfection efforts as the number of dengue fever cases in the southern port
city had risen to 54 as of Aug. 19, a municipal Department of Health (DOH)
official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Chen Chao-dong, a division chief in charge of disease control and prevention,
said that most of the cases occurred in the Houjing Area in the city's Nanzih
District, and out of the 54 cases, 46 cases were reported in the area's Jintien
and Rentien boroughs, with one diagnosed as dengue hemorrhagic fever.</P>
      <P>A 70-year-old patient, identified only by his family name Lin, was diagnosed
with dengue fever in July, which at one time threatened his life. However, the
patient recovered gradually after receiving treatment at Kaohsiung Veterans
General Hospital, and was moved to a general ward, said Chen.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, there is a great possibility that the mosquitoes that breed
the fever breed in old abandoned buildings in the area. Therefore, the DOH and
the Public Works Bureau have begun tearing down the buildings with excavators
and disinfecting the area Thursday, said Chen.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that there are 16 houses to be torn down on Houjing North Road and
Houjing Central Street, and that the owners of the houses have all agreed to the
action to prevent further spread of the disease.</P>
      <P>Huang Shuen-ming, chief of the Nanzih District Office, said that the office will

      <P>Parliamentarians of several Southeast Asian countries have expressed support for
Taiwan's bid to take part in activities related to the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations (ASEAN), ruling Kuomintang (KMT) legislators said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Legislative and political party leaders from Vietnam, Thailand and Indonesia
have all voiced their support for Taiwan in its efforts to participate in the
ASEAN grouping and related economic activities, according to Legislative Yuan
Vice President Tseng Yung-chuan.</P>
      <P>Tseng said at a news conference held immediately after returning from visits to
the three ASEAN member states with four other KMT legislators that Taiwan should
not be excluded from ASEAN, given that the country is geographically close to
these nations and is an important business and trade partner with the group.</P>
      <P>Tseng noted that China, Japan and South Korea will join ASEAN as "ASEAN plus
one, " "ASEAN plus two" and "ASEAN plus three" in 2010, 2011 and 2012,
respectively.</P>
      <P>Noting that the world's economy is moving toward a trend of integration, such as
the European Union and ASEAN, Tseng said Taiwan should not be marginalized from
this process.</P>
      <P>"These countries will sign free trade agreements (FTAs) and will benefit from
reduced tariffs, " Tseng said, adding that if Taiwan is marginalized from this
economic integration,  its international economic competitiveness will be
greatly affected.</P>
      <P>He noted that two-way trade between Taiwan and ASEAN member states has topped
US$60 billion over the past 49 years, with the number of two-way investment
projects totaling 8,790, involving some US$53.85 billion.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Hung Hsiu-chu said that due to the independence ideology espoused
by the previous Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) administration and China's
persistent containment policy against Taiwan, the country's economic development
and global engagement has lagged behind over the last eight years of DPP rule.</P>
      <P>"With cross-strait relations beginning to thaw since President Ma Ying-jeou's
May 20 inauguration, ASEAN member states seem to be somewhat relieved over their
relations with the two sides of the Taiwan Strait," Hung said.</P>
      <P>"The KMT-dominated legislature therefore hopes to take this opportunity to
expand Taiwan's international horizons to prevent Taiwan from being marginalized
in the international community, " Hung added.</P>
      <P>According to Hung, during the group's visit to Vietnam, Chen Huang-tan, head of
the Ho Chi Minh delegation to Vietnam's 10th legislature, promised to relay
Taiwan's intention of becoming an ASEAN dialogue partner to the Vietnamese
government.</P>
      <P>Sanoh Thienthong, leader of the Royal People Party of Thailand, said he will be
glad to assist Taiwan to achieve its goal of seeking closer engagement with
ASEAN, Hung added.</P>
      <P>She also said Indonesian parliamentary leader Theo L. Sambuaga told the
Taiwanese delegation that he will do his utmost to help Taiwan take part in
ASEAN activities, as it is imperative for Taiwan to get access to ASEAN's
10-country, 550-million person market, which is expected to form a unified
economic community by 2015.</P>

      <P>Speaking Thursday at the first Taipei International Robot Show (TIROS) , Vice
President Vincent Siew said that the show not only serves as an important
milestone but also indicates that robotics will be the next big industry.</P>
      <P>"Given the fact that robots are expected to be applied in many industries in the
future, Bill Gates predicts that robotics is the next big industry, " Siew said.
"The prospects present in the robotics industry are the same as those in the
personal computer industry when it was about to boom."</P>
      <P>He said thirty years ago it was hard to imagine that PCs would be in almost
every home and that what Gates said -- "robots in every home" -- can be expected
in thirty years.</P>
      <P>The  vice  president  encouraged  Taiwan's  semi-conductor, photonics,
engineering  and electric components industries to staunchly support the
robotics industry so Taiwan can seize the opportunity to become a leader in
another industry with billions of dollars in revenue.</P>
      <P>Chen Chao-yi, director-general of the Ministry of Economic Affairs' Industrial
Development Bureau, said that the show is aimed at showcasing robot technology
and attracting more companies and talent to join the robotics industry as well
as promoting the robotics industry in Taiwan and offering product platforms for
facilitating interaction among supply companies to help build the robotics
industry.</P>
      <P>"Compared to other countries, Taiwan has the advantage to edge into the robot
market in a short time, as it has a complete industrial  supply  chain and the
ability  to adjust to the fast-changing industry," he said.</P>
      <P>The Industrial Development Bureau has already invested NT$35 million (US$1.11
million) to help companies develop robots and the investment is expected to
generate an output value of NT$1.4 billion, according to Chen.</P>
      <P>He added that the latest statistics  show that Taiwanese companies have invested
NT$5.83 billion in developing intelligent robots and the government is aiming to
make Taiwan the design and manufacturing center for robots by 2015, generating
output revenues of NT$250 billion.</P>
      <P>Organized by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Taiwan Society of Manufacture
Engineering and Automation Technology, the Industrial Technology Research
Institute, and Precision Machinery R&amp;D Center, the 2008 TIROS is slated to
be held from Aug. 21-24 at the Taipei World Trade Center Exhibition Hall 1.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CDC gets drug certification for Russell's viper antivenin</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) announced Thursday that certification has
been issued for antivenin for envenomation by the Russell's viper, one of the
most venomous snakes found in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>CDC Deputy Director-General  Shih Wen-yi  said at a press conference that the
CDC has been conducting clinical experiments on antivenin for the Russell's
viper since 1999, but added that certification was only issued recently, as only
a few people are bitten each year, making human clinical trials difficult.</P>
      <P>With the certification of the antivenin, the CDC will be able to distribute it
to major hospitals in eastern and southern Taiwan, as well as health stations in
mountainous areas, where envenomation is more likely to occur, Shih added.</P>
      <P>One of Taiwan's most venomous snakes, the Russell's viper is relatively less
studied locally as it has a limited habitat and has a smaller population
compared to the other venomous snakes found in Taiwan, said Lien Wei-cheng,
chief of the vaccination center under the CDC, adding that no more than 10
people here are bitten by the snake every year.</P>
      <P>According to the CDC, the Russell's viper's venom is of high toxicity and has a
high fatality rate, as it is both a neurotoxin and a hemotoxin.</P>
      <P>"Results of clinical experiments show that if people bitten by the snake receive
the antivenin within three to six hours, symptoms of hemorrhage and renal
failure can be effectively alleviated, " said Hung Dung-zung, director of the
department of toxicology of the China Medical University Hospital, who was in
charge of the clinical experiments.</P>
      <P>He added that the fatality rate of people bitten by the Russell's viper was 17
percent before the antivenin was manufactured, and that those who survive can
suffer from muscle necrosis, renal failure or cerebral embolism.</P>
      <P>The antivenin has already saved more than 50 people's lives, according to the
CDC.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Fourth site of Central Science Park to be in Changhua County</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government has decided to select Erlin in Changhua County as the fourth site
for the Central Taiwan Science Park, according to the Cabinet-level National
Science Council (NSC), which administrates and manages all of the country's
science parks.</P>
      <P>According to the NSC, the new location in Erlin was selected from among seven
candidate sites by a review committee that visited all the areas in the three
days before the final decision was made at an Aug. 20 meeting.</P>
      <P>Yang Wen-ke, director-general of the park's administration, said that the Erlin
location has around 800 hectares, which can be expanded to over 1,000 hectares.
Of the total area, 600 hectares could be developed first to settle the factories
that have already been assigned to the site, he noted.</P>
      <P>According to the park administration, after the government appropriates the
construction funding of some NT$40 billion, the construction of the park's
infrastructure will start by July 2009 and is expected to be completed by 2013.</P>
      <P>After 2014, the administration said, the park might be able to help create some
40,000 jobs and generate annual production value of NT$500 billion.</P>
      <P>In response to the NSC decision, Changhua Magistrate Cho Po-yuan said the new
site will introduce more high-tech manufacturers to the county, helping change
it from agriculture-based to technology-based.</P>
      <P>The government decided to establish the central science park in 2000, with the
aim of replicating the success achieved in the Hsinchu Science Park and the
Southern Taiwan Science Park. To date, the park has three separate sites located
between Taichung City, Houli in Taichung County and Huwei in Yunlin County.</P>
      <P>As of the end of July, the 765-hectare park has 90 registered companies,
compared to 444 companies in Hsinchu and 157 companies in the southern science
park.</P>
      <P>In 2007, the central science park generated revenue of some NT$265.7 billion
(about US$8.47 billion) and employed 21,446 people. In 2008, the NSC estimates,
the park's revenues will reach NT$360 billion.</P>

      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan said Thursday that Cabinet agencies have been
collaborating to solve the alleged money-laundering case involving former
President Chen Shui-bian and his family.</P>
      <P>"We will seek international help to facilitate the probe into the case if
necessary," Liu said during an inspection tour of Ministry of Justice operations
and establishments in Taipei County.</P>
      <P>He reiterated the administration's resolve to break the case "in order to return
justice to the country."</P>
      <P>Chen, his wife Wu Shu-jen and Wu's elder brother Wu Ching-mao were listed
earlier this week as suspects in the case and have been barred from leaving the
country.</P>
      <P>The Special Investigation Division under the Supreme Prosecutors Office decided
Thursday to summon Chen's son Chen Chih-chung and daughter-in-law Huang Jui-
ching -- who have already left the country -- for questioning as suspects within
days.</P>
      <P>At issue is a report from the Egmont Group -- an international anti-money
laundering organization -- that the Investigation Bureau's Money Laundering
Prevention Center received in January, which details the status of bank accounts
created by Chen's family members in other countries, including the United
States, the Cayman Islands, Singapore and Switzerland.</P>
      <P>Wu Shu-jen claimed last week during questioning at her residence by prosecutors
that US$21 million deposited in the family's various overseas bank accounts was
"all legal income."  The money is distributed among three different accounts --
two in Switzerland held in the name of Huang Jui-ching and one in Singapore in
the name of Wu Ching-mao.</P>
      <P>Chen admitted several days ago that he did not faithfully report the election
campaign expenses from his two mayoral elections and two presidential elections
between 1993 and 2004, but claimed he was unaware that the balance of the funds
was wired abroad by his wife until early this year.</P>
      <P>He rejected the idea that the funds wired overseas could be connected to his
"state affairs fund" case and a recent scandal involving a botched attempt to
win Papua New Guinea as a diplomatic ally.</P>
      <P>An anonymous prosecutor said Monday he suspected the source of the money might
be "more complicated" than originally thought.</P>

      <P>The pro-independence Taiwan Society has said it will sponsor a demonstration
Aug. 30, the 100th day of Ma's administration, to highlight their cause, which
includes a call for the government to address public woes amid surging consumer

      <P>The Presidential Office said it "will respect the people's right to rally, " but

      <P>The pro-independence protesters want to call for tax rebates to low-income

      <P>They are also angry with the administration's tilt toward China, especially its
easing of a cap for local businesses wishing to invest in China. They will also
demand that Ma's administration insist on Taiwan's sovereignty to safeguard the
nation.</P>
      <P>The protesters will also call for clean politics.</P>

event, focusing on a better economy, Taiwan's sovereignty and the introduction

      <P>Taiwan bagged another bronze medal Thursday when Sung Yu-chi beat Daniel Manz of
Germany 4-3 in the bronze medal competition in the men's taekwondo 68 kg class
at the Beijing Olympics, bringing Taiwan its fourth bronze medal of the games.</P>
      <P>Sung's victory came one day after Taiwan's Chu Mu-yen, a 2004 Athens Olympics
gold medalist, took the country's third bronze medal in the men' under-58 kg
category of the event.</P>
      <P>Sung fell to his knees and thanked his coach and his father, Sung Ching-hung,
soon after he was announced the winner of the match.</P>
      <P>Despite his victory, Sung said he felt the bronze medal was "not good enough."</P>
      <P>"I am in perfect condition, " he said, expressing regret that he lost to Son
Taejin of South Korea 6-7 in a semifinal match, thereby missing the opportunity
for gold.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's taekwondo fighters took two golds in the 2004 Athens Olympics.</P>
      <P>In a quarterfinal match earlier in the day, Sung edged out Dmitriy Kim of
Uzbekistan 3-2.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, in the women's 57 kg class, Taiwan's Su Li-wen, who had suffered from
an injury to her left knee since the preliminary round of 16 earlier in the day,
was defeated by Croatia's Martina Zubcic 4-5 in the bronze medal match.</P>
      <P>Su tied with Zubcic 4-4 after the first three rounds, but lost a decisive point
in the fourth round.</P>
      <P>During the match, Su managed to continue fighting after falling several times in
obvious pain, as she did in previous competitions.</P>
      <P>Her perseverance earned her rounds of applause and cheers from the audience in
Beijing, as well as from members of the press from various countries.</P>
      <P>The 27-year-old -- who won gold at the 2006 Asian Games in Doha, the 2007 World

      <P>Prior to the competition, Su was described by the U.S.-based Sports Illustrated

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) released a statement Thursday for use by
the country's overseas representative offices and embassies to explain a money-
laundering scandal in which former President Chen Shui-bian and his family stand
accused of funneling large sums of cash into Swiss bank accounts, in a bid to
protect the nation's image.</P>
      <P>"The Republic of China sternly holds the stance of opposing money-laundering, a
behavior that harms social justice and abuses international financial freedom, "
the MOFA statement said, adding that President Ma Ying-jeou has stressed many
times that promoting clean and honest government is his top priority and that
no-one, even former heads of state, should be above the law.</P>
      <P>The Foreign Ministry said Taiwan's international image has been deeply tarnished
since the breaking of the scandal in which the former first family is involved,
as it has sparked a lot of news reports from local and international media.</P>
      <P>"Given the fact that the case has entered the judicial process, the ministry,
along with its embassies and overseas representative offices, will fully
cooperate with the investigation and ask for assistance from related governments
and international anti-money- laundering organization in order to clarify the
truth as soon as possible, " it stated.</P>
      <P>Noting that there have been four presidential elections and two transfers of
political power between political parties since 1996, the ministry said it is
because Taiwan has experienced such rapid democratic progress compared to other
newly democratized countries that the case was exposed and brought under
investigation so quickly.</P>
      <P>However, the ministry admitted that laws regarding regulating public servants'
political funds have failed to keep pace with Taiwan's democratic progress.</P>
      <P>It said a consensus was reached across party lines at the Legislative Yuan
recently that a draft "Property with Unknown Source Act" will be reviewed in the
next legislative session.</P>
      <P>Chen admitted last Thursday that he lied about the campaign expenses for his two
mayoral elections and two presidential elections between 1993 and 2004 and that
his wife wired surplus campaign contributions into overseas bank accounts held
by members of his family.</P>
      <P>His confession came only after the Foreign Ministry confirmed earlier that same
day that the Swiss authorities have sought Taiwan' s help in a probe into a
possible money laundering case in Switzerland involving Chen's son Chen Chih-
chung and daughter-in-law Huang Jui- ching.</P>
      <P>The former president claims that his wife Wu Shu-jen made the wire transfers
without his knowledge.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors who searched Chen's home and office in Taipei last Saturday for
evidence in connection with the scandal said Chen has been prohibited from
leaving the country.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A variety of Taiwanese vegetables are growing well on the southern Japanese
island of Kyushu thanks to the promotion of a Taiwanese restaurateur in Tokyo.</P>
      <P>Tang Kun-yu, who operates a Taiwanese-style restaurant in Tokyo's Meguro
district, held a news conference in Tokyo Wednesday to introduce the dazzling
array of popular Taiwanese vegetables grown by Japanese farmers in Kyushu with
seeds and know-how provided by him.</P>
      <P>On display were Taiwanese bamboo shoots, amaranth, taro, clery, luffa gourd,
chives and chaylte vine.</P>
      <P>To meet the demands of his restaurant, Tang said he began to cooperate with
farmers in Kyushu in cultivating vegetables popular in Taiwan on an experimental
basis five years ago, as Kyushu's climate and clay soil are similar to Taiwan's.</P>
      <P>"The initial results were encouraging, as the Taiwanese seeds grew well on the
Kyushu farms and our restaurant patrons welcomed the locally grown produce,"
Tang recalled.</P>
      <P>The cooperative project has since expanded, with the total acreage of contracted
farmland reaching scores of hectares, Tang went on, adding that more Japanese
farmers are expected to take part in the venture in the future.</P>
      <P>"Many Kyushu farmers are interested in cooperating with me because growing
Taiwanese vegetables is like exploring a `new frontier' that they believe offers
a promising future, " Tang explained, adding that Taiwanese vegetables grown in
Kyushu are treated as locally grown produce.</P>
      <P>According to Tang, the cooperation project got a boost after the poisoned gyoza
(Chinese dumpling) incident in Japan in January this year in which 10-plus
Japanese citizens fell ill after consuming frozen gyoza from China.</P>
      <P>"The incident aroused Japanese concerns for food safety and attracted  more
attention to my project of planting Taiwanese vegetables in Kyushu, " Tang said,
adding that the collaboration has helped increase the diversity of vegetables
available on the Japanese market.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, Takahiro Terajima, a Kyushu farmer responsible
for planting Taiwanese bamboo shoots and leafy vegetables for Tang's restaurant,
said he takes great delight in growing Taiwanese vegetables.</P>
      <P>Lamenting that many Japanese farmers intend to seek government subsidies because
farming is not often profitable, Terajima said cooperating with Tang makes his
life meaningful as the project offers fresh experiences and the chance of making
a profit.</P>
      <P>"Planting Taiwanese vegetables, such as bamboo shoots and leafy vegetables, are
different from growing native Japanese species. It interests me and makes my
life meaningful," he said, adding that some Taiwanese vegetables, such as tomato
and luffa gourd, taste better than Japanese ones.</P>

      <P>Some 65 percent of the middle- and high-level executives in Taiwan lack regular
exercise and as a consequence, suffer from poor heart and lung endurance,
according to the results of a study released Thursday.</P>
      <P>The study,  conducted by the Lian An Preventive  Medicine Organization, analyzed
the physical examination results of 6,093 middle- and high-level executives who
had visited the organization between  2000  and 2007,  and interviewed  them
recently  via questionnaire.</P>
      <P>The results show that they worked an average 9.5 hours per day, that most of
them were sedentary office workers, and that 55 percent of them admitted they
were not in the habit of taking regular exercise.</P>
      <P>The study also found that most of the executives suffered from physical fatigue
due to their long working hours and preferred to spend their leisure time
sleeping rather than exercising.</P>
      <P>The physical results show that 65 percent of them had poor heart and lung
endurance, while 58 percent had weak leg muscles, with another 52 percent
failing to meet standards for waist suppleness.</P>
      <P>Tsai Mei-wen, a lecturer at the Department of Physical Therapy and Assistive
Technology of National Yang-Ming University, said poor heart and lung endurance
can cause fatigue and poor concentration and increase the risks of coronary
artery disease and metabolic diseases by up to five times higher than those with
better heart and lung endurance.</P>
      <P>She said a person who has little time for daily exercise must try to find time
to exercise at least three times a week, with each session lasting at least 30
minutes and with enough exertion to increase the heart rate to 130 beats per
minute.</P>
      <P>According to Tsai, swimming and jogging are ideal forms of exercise because they
are not too demanding and can improve heart and lung function.</P>

    <HEADLINE>New location needed to ease overcrowding at detention center: PM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 21 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan said Thursday that a new location for the Taipei
Detention House in Tucheng, Taipei County is urgently needed to solve an
overcrowding problem.</P>
      <P>The detention house is used to incarcerate lawsuit suspects and people serving
short prison sentences.</P>
      <P>According to Lee Mung-tung, director-general of the detention house, the inmates
numbered around 3,600 as of the end of July, while the capacity should be only
about 2,100.</P>
      <P>Lee said overcrowding in the women's section is even more serious, with an
excess ratio of 198 percent, which is lower than the 302 percent recorded in
2007.</P>
      <P>Many female inmates have to sleep at a nearby vocational training plant because
there is not enough space in the detention center, Lee said.</P>
      <P>Liu said an earlier government plan of moving the detention house to a former
Ministry of National Defense ammunition depot in the county has raised
objections from local residents, but he said the government will continue to
communicate with local residents to seek their consent and cooperation.</P>
      <P>He also asked the Taipei county government and the Ministry of Justice, which
supervises the detention house, to work together on measures to carry out the
move.</P>
      <P>Liu said the government will promote the idea of replacing penalties for petty
crimes with alternative  punishments  like community service or fines to ease
the problem of overcrowding, which he said is affecting the environment around
the detention house.</P>
      <P>Before Liu went to the detention house, he also reviewed the environment of the
Hsindian Drug Abuse Treatment Center in the county's Hsindian City and issued
instruction for improving the center's treatment efficiency,  including
increasing supervisory personnel and renovating and updating the facilities.</P>

      <P>A boy with chromosome abnormalities who has outlived doctors' predictions of a
12-year life expectancy and who received the President's Award for Educational
Excellence earlier this year, was honored by the Tainan city government
Thursday.</P>
      <P>The boy, Hsu Jun-jie, has had a rough life so far. Born with chromosome
abnormalities, his parents divorced when he was young, said a city government
official. While his father worked part-time, the boy went ragpicking with his
grandmother in an effort to make ends meet.</P>
      <P>According to the official, Hsu was not only diagnosed with chromosome
abnormalities but also with serious heart problems. He underwent heart surgery
at the age of 6 and was back in hospital for brain surgery at 12.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Hsu conquered all the difficulties that beset him and outlived
doctors' expectations that he would die by the age of 12. He has not only
learned to play the drums, rollerblade and paint, but has also maintained top
academic performance, the official noted.</P>
      <P>The official said the boy, now aged 13, will begin studying at Tainan Municipal
Yen-ping Junior High School this September.</P>
      <P>No one knows how much longer Hsu will live, but he has proved himself full of
miracles, noted the official, who added that the family is waiting hopefully for
more miracles.</P>

      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairwoman Lai Shin-yuan departed for the United
States late Thursday for her first overseas trip since assuming office in May.</P>
      <P>High on Lai's itinerary will be attending a meeting of the Taiwanese Association
of America to be held in Chicago this weekend. As government's top China policy
coordinator, Lai will deliver a speech on the current state of relations across
the Taiwan Strait and relevant future development.</P>
      <P>In addition, Lai said prior to her departure that she will visit Washington,
D.C. to meet with American politicians, academics and think tank researchers.</P>
      <P>"I'll brief them on the basic framework for development of cross-strait
relations under the leadership of President Ma Ying-jeou and exchange views with
them on related topics, " Lai explained, adding that she will help her American
hosts better understand Ma's visions and concepts for the cross-strait ties and
on development of Taiwan-U.S. relations.</P>
      <P>As for the much-anticipated second round of cross-strait talks, Lai said the two
quasi-official intermediary bodies on both sides of the Taiwan Strait will
definitely hold a new round of negotiations before the end of this year to
settle several major pending issues, including expansion of weekend direct
cross-strait chart flights and redemarcation of cross-strait flight paths to
make them more straight to save time and fuel costs.</P>
      <P>Also high on the agenda for the second round of talks will also include launch
of direct cross-strait cargo charter flights and cooperation in cross-border
crime fighting, Lai said..</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation and Beijing's Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Strait held their first round of talks after a nine-year
hiatus in June, in which they signed deals on the launch of weekend passenger
charter flights and on allowing more Chinese tourists to visit Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Cross-strait tensions thawed after the inauguration of Ma's administration in
May as Ma adopted a reconciliatory approach toward sensitive Taipei-Beijing

      <P>Taiwan bagged another bronze medal Thursday when Sung Yu-chi beat Daniel Manz of
Germany 4-3 in the bronze medal competition in the men's taekwondo 68 kg class
at the Beijing Olympics, bringing Taiwan its fourth bronze medal of the games.</P>
      <P>Sung's victory came one day after Taiwan's Chu Mu-yen, a 2004 Athens Olympics
gold medalist, took the country's third bronze medal in the men' under-58 kg
category of the event.</P>
      <P>Sung fell to his knees and thanked his coach and his father, Sung Ching-hung,
soon after he was announced the winner of the match.</P>
      <P>Despite his victory, Sung said he felt the bronze medal was "not good enough."</P>
      <P>"I am in perfect condition, " he said, expressing regret that he lost to Son
Taejin of South Korea 6-7 in a semifinal match, thereby missing the opportunity
for gold.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's taekwondo fighters took two golds in the 2004 Athens Olympics.</P>
      <P>In a quarterfinal match earlier in the day, Sung edged out Dmitriy Kim of
Uzbekistan 3-2.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, in the women's 57 kg class, Taiwan's Su Li-wen, who had suffered from
an injury to her left knee since the preliminary round of 16 earlier in the day,
was defeated by Croatia's Martina Zubcic 4-5 in the bronze medal match.</P>
      <P>Su tied with Zubcic 4-4 after the first three rounds, but lost a decisive point
in the fourth round.</P>
      <P>During the match, Su managed to continue fighting after falling several times in
obvious pain, as she did in previous competitions.</P>
      <P>Her perseverance earned her rounds of applause and cheers from the audience in
Beijing, as well as from members of the press from various countries.</P>
      <P>The 27-year-old -- who won gold at the 2006 Asian Games in Doha, the 2007 World
University Games in Bangkok and the 2008 Asian Taekwondo Championship -- was
taken to hospital soon after her defeat.</P>
      <P>Prior to the competition, Su was described by the U.S.-based Sports Illustrated
as the only Taiwanese athlete capable of winning a gold for the country. It was
her first Olympics.</P>
      <P>Her defeat came after she beat Robin Cheong of New Zealand 1-0 in the repechage
section of the event, but lost the round of 16 to Lim Su-jeong of South Korea
0-1.</P>

      <P>Some 65 percent of the middle- and high-level executives in Taiwan lack regular
exercise and as a consequence, suffer from poor heart and lung endurance,
according to the results of a study released Thursday.</P>
      <P>The study,  conducted by the Lian An Preventive  Medicine Organization, analyzed
the physical examination results of 6,093 middle- and high-level executives who
had visited the organization between  2000  and 2007,  and interviewed  them
recently  via questionnaire.</P>
      <P>The results show that they worked an average 9.5 hours per day, that most of
them were sedentary office workers, and that 55 percent of them admitted they
were not in the habit of taking regular exercise.</P>
      <P>The study also found that most of the executives suffered from physical fatigue
due to their long working hours and preferred to spend their leisure time
sleeping rather than exercising.</P>
      <P>The physical results show that 65 percent of them had poor heart and lung
endurance, while 58 percent had weak leg muscles, with another 52 percent
failing to meet standards for waist suppleness.</P>
      <P>Tsai Mei-wen, a lecturer at the Department of Physical Therapy and Assistive
Technology of National Yang-Ming University, said poor heart and lung endurance
can cause fatigue and poor concentration and increase the risks of coronary
artery disease and metabolic diseases by up to five times higher than those with
better heart and lung endurance.</P>
      <P>She said a person who has little time for daily exercise must try to find time
to exercise at least three times a week, with each session lasting at least 30
minutes and with enough exertion to increase the heart rate to 130 beats per
minute.</P>
      <P>According to Tsai, swimming and jogging are ideal forms of exercise because they
are not too demanding and can improve heart and lung function.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Ex-MJIB head's homes searched in document concealment probe</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Prosecutors raided three houses belonging to former Ministry of Justice
Investigation Bureau (MJIB) Director Yeh Sheng-mao late Thursday in a probe into
the alleged concealment of documents related to suspected money laundering by
the former first family.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors searched Yeh's homes in Taipei City and Taoyuan County for documents
regarding a report received by the MJIB's Money Laundering Prevention Center in
January that said the daughter-in-law of then-President Chen Shui-bian
maintained a bank account in the Cayman Islands.</P>
      <P>The report was passed on to Taiwan by the Egmont Group -- an international anti-
money laundering organization -- of which the MJIB is a member.</P>
      <P>However, the local prosecutorial authorities were not made aware of the
information until the Swiss authorities approached Taiwan recently for
assistance in probes into suspected money laundering in Switzerland by Chen's
daughter-in-law, Huang Jui-ching.</P>
      <P>Yeh, who retired from the top MJIB post after the inauguration of the Kuomintang
government in May, admitted last weekend that he did not deliver any formal
documents concerning the sensitive information to the prosecution before his
retirement because of what he claimed was his "personal negligence."</P>
      <P>Yeh, who is one of the former president's proteges, claimed that he made an oral
report to State Public Prosecutor-General Chen Tsung-ming in early February -- a
claim that the prosecutor-general strongly denied.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Justice (MOJ) directed the Taipei Prosecutors Office early this
week to investigate who should be held accountable for withholding the critical
intelligence.</P>
      <P>On Thursday, the prosecution summoned Chou You-yi, director of the MJIB's Money
Laundering Prevention Center for questioning. Chou was quoted as having told
prosecutors that the center had documented the intelligence from the Egmont
Group and passed it to Yeh in the form of an official file.</P>
      <P>In March, Chou said, he again asked Yeh whether he had forwarded the information
to the prosecution. "Yeh told me at the time that he had forwarded the document
to the state public prosecutor-general, " Chou told prosecutors.</P>
      <P>In Thursday's raids on Yeh's three homes, prosecutors reportedly did not
discover any of the official records or documents in question.</P>
      <P>While searching Yeh's residence in Taipei's suburban Muzha district, prosecutors
reportedly questioned some of Yeh's family members and scrutinized community
security monitoring videos in an effort to verify a recent report about Yeh
hiring a truck to move cases of articles out of his home there.</P>
      <P>Yeh did not come home until after the prosecutors had concluded their search.
Lin Chin-tsun, a spokesman for the prosecutors office, was tight-lipped on the
issue and declined to brief the press on the latest prosecutorial operations on
the grounds that the case is still being investigated in accordance with the
law.</P>
      <P>Anonymous prosecutorial sources said they suspect the critical documents might
have been destroyed. Prosecutors are scheduled to summon Yeh for further

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Friday that his government has been working hard to
mend fences between top-level officials of Taiwan and the United States
following eight years of strained relations under the previous Democratic
Progressive Party administration.</P>
      <P>Ma made the comments while meeting with a U.S. congressional delegation headed
by Carolyn Bartholomew, vice chairwoman of the U.S.-China Economic and Security
Review Commission (USCC) , at the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>The president expressed confidence that with continued efforts, friendly
relations between top officials from the two countries will soon be restored.</P>
      <P>He also noted that his administration has been working hard to improve cross-
Taiwan Strait ties since assuming office three months ago, with fruitful
results.</P>
      <P>Tension between Taiwan and China has been significantly reduced as a result of
these efforts, he added.</P>
      <P>The president noted that during his recent stopover in Los Angeles en route to
Latin America for a state visit to two of Taiwan's diplomatic allies in the
region, he had conversations in person or over the phone with 31 members of the
U.S. Congress, who all said that the positive development of cross-strait ties
is in America's national interest.</P>
      <P>The government will continue to hold talks with China on a variety of trade and
transport issues, Ma went on, expressing hope that besides seeing a
normalization in economic relations across the strait, the two sides will come
to a truce on the international relations front for everyone's benefit.</P>
      <P>Noting that many members of the delegation have been to Taiwan before, Ma said
this visit is different from previous ones because of the fundamental changes in
the cross-strait situation.</P>
      <P>The  president  also  expressed  the hope  that  the U.S. administration will
approve as soon as possible the sale of seven weapons systems to Taiwan that has
already received the green light from Congress.</P>
      <P>The list of arms in question includes P-3C Orion anti-submarine planes, anti-
tank missiles, PAC-3 missiles, Apache helicopters, diesel powered submarines,
sea-launched Harpoon missiles, and F-16 C/D fighters.</P>
      <P>Ma called for Washington to approve the transfer in order to allow Taiwan to
maintain proper defensive capabilities.</P>
      <P>In order to show Taiwan's resolve in living up to its obligations to provide for
its own defenses, the nation's defense budget will not drop to below 3 percent
of gross domestic product in the future, he added.</P>
      <P>The USCC, created in 2000 by an act of Congress, monitors, investigates and
submits to Congress annual reports on the national security  implications  of
the bilateral  trade  and  economic relationship between the United States and
China, and provides recommendations to Congress for legislative and
administrative action when necessary.</P>
      <P>Bartholomew was re-appointed to the commission for a fourth term in December
last year by U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, for whom she has previously served

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou called Taiwanese taekwondo fighter Su Li-wen Friday to
offer his admiration for the courage and perseverance she demonstrated in her
fights at the Beijing Olympic Games Thursday  despite injury,  according  to
Presidential Office spokesman Wang Yu-chi.</P>
      <P>In a phone call to Beijing, Ma told Su, who battled to the end in the women's
57kg taekwondo bronze medal competition in defiance of a painful knee injury,
that her courage and perseverance  have tremendously touched his heart and those
of all the people in Taiwan, Wang told reporters.</P>
      <P>"The sportsmanship you demonstrated provides an exemplary model for the
country's youth to emulate that is worth far more than any gold medal," Ma told
Su.</P>
      <P>Su, 27, champion of the 2006 Asian Games in Doha, the 2007 World University
Games  in Bangkok  and the 2008  Asian  Taekwondo Championship, suffered an
injury to her left knee in the preliminary round of 16 earlier Thursday.</P>
      <P>She tied with Croatia's Martina Zubcic 4-4 after the first three rounds of the
bronze medal match, but was defeated after losing a decisive point in the fourth
round.</P>
      <P>During the match, Su continued battling till the end despite falling 11 times --
in obvious pain -- as she did in previous competitions.</P>
      <P>Her perseverance earned her rounds of applause and cheers from the audience in
Beijing, as well as from members of the international press.</P>
      <P>Su was carried from the mat by her coach after her defeat and was taken to
hospital for immediate treatment.</P>
      <P>Prior to the competition, Su was described by the U.S.-based Sports Illustrated
as the only Taiwanese athlete capable of winning a gold for the country. It was
her first Olympics.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, according to Wang, Ma also phoned Su's father in Taishan, Taipei
County, Friday to tell the senior Su how proud the country is of his daughter.</P>
      <P>Ma asked Su's father to tell his daughter not to be daunted by the defeats that
she suffered in the Olympics and to carry on with her career as a professional
taekwondo fighter, according to Wang.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOFA to write to foreign media if nation's image continues to worsen</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Friday that the ministry will
instruct all embassies and overseas representative offices to write to local
media to explain the government's stance if the nation's image continues to be
marred by the scandal involved the former first family's alleged funneling of
large sums of cash into foreign bank accounts.</P>
      <P>Officials indicated that the Foreign Ministry is raising its alert on the
international response to the scandal and is ready to take more action to
protect the country's image.</P>
      <P>"If the international media continues to report on the matter, I think our MOFA
officials will have to write to the media, " MOFA spokesman Henry Chen said.
"The basic stance will be that the government is determined to tackle
corruption."</P>
      <P>The ministry released a statement a day earlier for use by the country's
overseas representative offices and embassies to explain the scandal.</P>
      <P>The statement said the Republic of China holds a firm stance of opposing money-
laundering, an offense that harms social justice and abuses international
financial freedom, adding that the ministry will fully cooperate with the
investigation and ask for assistance from related foreign governments and
international anti-money-laundering organizations in order to clarify the truth
as soon as possible</P>
      <P>Noting that laws regulating public servants' political funds have failed to keep
pace with Taiwan's democratic progress, the MOFA stressed that consensus has
been reached across party lines at the Legislative Yuan recently that a draft
"Property of Unknown Source Act" will be reviewed in the next legislative
session.</P>
      <P>"These principles are aimed at letting the international media know that our
government is doing a lot, " Chen said. "We hope that the international
community will understand that the government is not only hard-working but also
proactive in fighting corruption, as it is something it finds completely
unacceptable," he added.</P>
      <P>He confirmed that the Control Yuan sent two of its committee members and an
investigator to the Foreign Ministry Thursday, saying that the ministry  offered
its full cooperation  and provided information related to the case.</P>
      <P>Former President Chen Shui-bian admitted last Thursday that he lied about the
campaign expenses for his two mayoral elections and two presidential elections
between 1993 and 2004 and that his wife wired surplus campaign contributions
into overseas bank accounts held by members of his family.</P>
      <P>His confession came only after the Foreign Ministry confirmed earlier that same
day that the Swiss authorities have sought Taiwan's help in a probe into a
possible money laundering case in Switzerland involving Chen's son Chen Chih-
chung and daughter-in-law Huang Jui-ching.</P>
      <P>The former president claims that his wife Wu Shu-jen made the wire transfers
without his knowledge.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors have banned Chen from leaving the country.</P>

      <P>Up to 40 percent of hospital inpatients suffer from malnutrition, with the ratio
as high as between 50 percent and 60 percent for patients in gastroenterology

      <P>Kao Ai-wen, director of the hospital's nutrition support service, said that if
patients are malnourished before being admitted to the hospital, 80 percent of
them will deteriorate after being admitted, according to the results of a
survey.</P>
      <P>Kao cited her hospital as an example, saying that "among the inpatients, 30
percent of them suffer from malnutrition, while 26 percent of colorectal
patients have serious malnutrition."</P>
      <P>Kao noted that nutrition plays a major role in treatment and that malnutrition
not only add risks of complication and mortality but also dramatically increases
the chances of infection, the number of days spent in hospital, and the medical

    <HEADLINE>Hero longs for peace on anniversary of battle</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>08/22/08  16:45:22</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>He is one of a few postmen in Taiwan to have won the Kuanghua medal from the
Ministry of National Defense, as a result of his part in the 1958 artillery
battle between China and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>However, on the eve of the 50th anniversary of the battle, 74-year-old Tung Kuo-
chung said he would happily give up his medal in exchange for peace if he had
the choice.</P>
      <P>The battle began Aug. 23, 1958 when the first shot fired by Chinese artillery
troops deployed across the narrow strait from the Taiwan-controlled island of
Kinmen exploded on the tiny island at 5: 30 p.m.</P>
      <P>That first barrage lasted for two hours, during which Chinese artillery troops
pounded the island with more than 57,000 shells.</P>
      <P>Tung, 24 at the time, was serving as a postman at Kinmen's now-defunct First
Military Post Office, which was responsible for delivering letters to various
military units on the island.</P>
      <P>Tung's beat covered Mount Taiwu, which housed the Kinmen Defense Command and was
therefore the target of China's heaviest attacks.</P>
      <P>As a young man who grew up on the frontline island, Tung was no stranger to
artillery attacks, but none so intensive as the one the island underwent in that
battle.</P>
      <P>In order to deliver his letters, Tung went on his regular round between volleys,
crawling from position to position and taking shelter in bunkers or whatever
object could shield him from the Chinese shelling.</P>
      <P>As there were no telephone links between Kinmen and Taiwan at the time, Tung
knew that letters were the only link between soldiers pinned down by artillery
fire and their families in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>It was about 2 a.m. the next day when Tung finished delivering all the mail he
received Aug. 23 and retuned to his home at Gugang, in southern Kinmen where his
mother, wife and 23-day-old baby girl were waiting anxiously for his return.</P>
      <P>He knelt down in front of the flickering flame of the "Heaven Lantern, "which
was supposed to bring his family the blessings of the Emperor of Heaven, and the
tablet of his ancestors enshrined in the family altar, thanking them for his
survival.</P>
      <P>The relentless artillery barrage lasted for 44 days. Chinese troops hammered the
148 square-kilometer island with more than 474,000 shells -- a rate of four
shells per square meter.</P>
      <P>At the peak of the barrage, the whole island was shrouded by a thick cloud of
smoke and many residents and soldiers hunkered down in bunkers and shelters
could hardly breathe because of the reek of gunpowder.</P>
      <P>Tung carried on with his job despite the danger, visiting the different
positions to deliver letters to the soldiers and learning to predict the
distances of the explosions by the sound they made.</P>
      <P>The reward was more than adequate compensation for the risks he was taking, as
Tung was welcomed by the soldiers wherever he went with his post bag.</P>
      <P>The soldiers greeted him with applause, shouting "long life to the postman, " or
carrying him on their shoulders as a hero before poring over the letters he
brought.</P>
      <P>Tung would collect letters and money the soldiers wanted to sent back to their
homes in Taiwan, as well as buying postage stamps for them.</P>
      <P>His services earned him the nickname "soldiers' vitamin" on the island and the
Kuanghua medal after the battle.</P>
      <P>The barrage took a heavy toll on the island, taking the lives of around 500
military personnel, including the three deputy commanders of the Kinmen Defense
Center, and 80 civilians, and leaving hardly a house undamaged.</P>
      <P>Tung, who retired from the Kinmen Post Office in 1996, recalled that his teacher
at elementary school had encouraged him and his classmates to "reclaim the
Chinese mainland and eat a bowl of noodles at Nanjing."</P>
      <P>Nanjing was the capital of the Chinese nationalist government before it lost a
civil war to the Chinese communist regime and relocated to Taiwan in 1949.</P>
      <P>Tung said he did eat bowls of noodles -- not only in Nanjing, but also in
Shanghai, Guangzhou and Beijing on the mainland -- not because Taiwan won the
war against China but because the two former civil war rivals decided to bury
the hatchet and reach out to each other after 1987.</P>
      <P>Tung lent his medal for permanent display at the Postal Museum in Taipei after
the battle, as the Directorate General of Posts considers him a paragon for his
dedication to his job amid the flying shells and hope his courage will rub off
on his fellow workers.</P>
      <P>Looking at his grandchildren toddling around him at his Gugang home, Tung said
he hopes his descendants will live in peace forever and will never suffer the
ordeal of war.</P>

      <P>The Cabinet gave the nod Thursday to a set of 2009 administrative guidelines
aimed at regenerating national prosperity and ensuring good governance,
integrity, and the rule of law, which will be filed with the Legislative Yuan
for confirmation by the end of this month.</P>
      <P>The guidelines cover five policy directions and one of the principal  goals is
to boost national competitiveness  through improving  cross Taiwan-Strait
relations,  easing  regulations, conducting  tax  reforms,  increasing
investment  in  public infrastructure projects,  and building a clean,
competent and efficient government, a Cabinet official said Friday.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet also plans to improve care for the disadvantaged and will continue
providing subsidies for low-income households and families close to the poverty
line, and well as working to strengthen emergency relief response, according to
the official.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet has formulated a new national pension scheme set to take  effect
Oct  1,  and  has  launched  a  NT$2  million government-subsidized home loan
program for young people that will be interest-free for the first two years. The
government is also working to improve long term care services for the elderly
and expand lunch programs for children from low-income families.</P>
      <P>Ensuring Taiwan's self-sufficiency in energy and food is another administrative
goal,  the official continued,  adding that the government has taken various
measures to promote energy conservation and carbon emissions reduction, such as
encouraging taxi drivers to convert to dual-fuel vehicles,  promoting the use of
electric scooters, spurring the development of low carbon industries and
increasing rice stockpiles by making better use of fallow farmland.</P>
      <P>The other objective is pushing for the rejuvenation of culture, education and
technology by promoting the development of a cultural and creative industry,
reviewing the efficacy of educational reform, establishing criteria for the
assessment of teaching quality and strengthening  cooperation between
enterprises and the academic sector.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the government will set up a mechanism that will allow government
officials to regularly meet with representatives from all walks of life and
listen to their opinions before mapping out future policies.</P>

      <P>Most students graduating from universities this year will accept NT$25,000 or
less as a minimum monthly starting salary, indicating that fresh graduates
generally do not expect much from their first jobs, according to the results of
a survey released Friday.</P>
      <P>The results show that 47.26 percent of fresh graduates think a minimum amount
ranging between NT$20,001 and NT$25,000 is acceptable for starting salary, 24.7
percent think an amount between NT$25,001 and NT$30,000 is acceptable, and 15.73
percent think NT$20,000 or below is acceptable.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted March 3-July 4 among 1,348 graduates by www.ejob.gov.tw
-- an employment-brokering Web site operated by the Council of Labor Affairs.</P>
      <P>Besides questions concerning their chances of success, questions related to
salaries were mentioned  by the largest number of respondents as what they would
most like to raise during a job interview but lack the courage to do so.</P>
      <P>The survey found that 75.15 percent of the respondents plan to begin their job
search immediately after graduation, while 10.39 percent plan to obtain
professional licensing or take professional skills courses and 4.01 percent plan
to take a civil service examination.</P>
      <P>The qualifications that the respondents believe would be helpful to their
chances of finding employment include holding more than one professional
license, good manners, the possession of professional skills, good communication
skills and ability to express themselves, and foreign language skills.</P>
      <P>The respondents also said it would help impress potential employers during job
interviews if they show self-confidence, act sincerely and modestly,  express
themselves well,  prove their abilities with licenses or work experience, and be

    <HEADLINE>Activists call for support for Aug. 30 rally</HEADLINE>

      <P>The Taiwan public was urged Friday to take part in a mass rally being organized
by the pro-independence Taiwan Society and other activists groups slated for
Aug. 30, Hsu Yung-ming, an executive director of Taiwan Thinktank said Friday.</P>
      <P>Hsu called for the public to join the rally, saying that the march -- aimed at
championing the people's power to oversee the government -- is not a pro-Chen
Shui-bian nor anti-Chen rally.</P>
      <P>Former President Chen Shui-bian, his wife Wu Shu-jen and Wu's elder brother Wu
Ching-mao were listed earlier this week as suspects in an alleged overseas money
laundering case and have been barred from leaving the country.</P>
      <P>The Special Investigation Division under the Supreme Prosecutors Office decided
Thursday to summon Chen's son Chen Chih-chung and daughter-in-law Huang Jui-
ching -- who have already left the country -- for questioning as suspects within
days.</P>
      <P>At issue is a report from the Egmont Group -- an international anti-money
laundering organization -- that the Investigation Bureau's Money Laundering
Prevention Center received in January, which details the status of bank accounts
created by Chen's family members in other countries, including the United
States, the Cayman Islands, Singapore and Switzerland.</P>
      <P>Responding to the latest development, members of several social activist groups
in Taiwan called Friday for early passage of more "Sunshine bills" to combat
corruption by public functionaries.</P>
      <P>Participants at a colloquium sponsored by Taiwan Thinktank said unanimously
that corruption  by senior  officials  and public functionaries could be rooted
out only by changing the governing systems, such as enactment of more "Sunshine
bills" that will oblige senior officials and civil servants to account for their
private assets.</P>
      <P>At the colloquium, Hung Yu-hung, convenor of the Constitution Reform Alliance,
called for the Legislative Yuan in its next legislative session to enact a law
that would make it a crime for government officials to hold unexplained wealth.</P>
      <P>"Under current circumstances, there will be no solid evidence to adequately
prove that the huge amount of money that Chen's wife wired overseas were the
gains of corruption committed by Chen during his tenures as president and Taipei
mayor," Hung said.</P>
      <P>"In the current legal environment, there are no ways to deal with Chen on any
corruption charges, " Hung said, adding that it would only mark a bankruptcy of
Chen's political morality at best.</P>
      <P>Hung suggested the Legislative Yuan enact a law that would make it a crime for
government officials to hold unexplained wealth and that the law should be
retrospective --  allowing all senior officials, sitting or retired, to be
scrutinized in terms of possession of private assets.</P>
      <P>"If that law is put into force, Chen would unavoidably be found guilty, and many
figures from the opposition Democratic Progressive Party and the ruling
Kuomintang (KMT) could be indicted, " Hung speculated.</P>
      <P>"Half of the politicians in the country would be downed by the law --
consequently  ushering in a new clean and competent government," he claimed.</P>
      <P>Ku Chung-hua, chairman of the Citizen Congress Watch, urged the KMT-dominating
Legislature to pass the bill into law as soon as possible so that all government
officials and public functionaries could be scrutinized by same rules and
criteria.</P>

      <P>The Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) will convene a meeting on minimum wage
adjustment Aug. 26 to allow representatives of both employers and employees to
exchange views on the possibility of a further wage hike, a council official
said Friday.</P>
      <P>According to CLA Deputy Minister Pan Shih-wei, the meeting is to fulfill a
promise made last year by the previous administration to review the minimum wage
again.</P>
      <P>The meeting will be attended by 22 wage reviewing committee members, including
four representatives of the employers, four of the employees, and 14 government
officials, including CLA Minister Wang Ju-hsuan, Pan said.</P>
      <P>The minimum wage was increased last July by 9.09 percent. Currently, the minimum
monthly wage is NT$17,280 (US$551) and the mimimum hourly wage is NT$95.</P>
      <P>About 1.41 million people in the country's workforce -- including foreign
laborers, part-time workers,  senior citizens who have returned to the
employment market after retirement and female workers -- have benefited from
last year's wage hike.</P>
      <P>At a meeting Friday, in preparation for the formal meeting next week,
representatives of both the employers and employees ended up in discord on the
issue.</P>
      <P>Jen Mu-shan, president of National Trade Union Confederation and a
representative of the employees, said minimum wage had not been adjusted for a
decade before last year, but even that adjustment did not include a reasonable
increase.</P>
      <P>Huang Cheng-yu, a member of the Manufactures' United General Association of
Industrial Parks of the R.O.C. and a representative of the employers, said
another wage hike would create a heavier burden for employers, especially when
the country's economic development is not performing well.</P>
      <P>Because of the opposing viewpoints, the meeting between the two sides failed to
reach a consensus, and the discussion will continue next week.</P>
      <P>Vice Chairman Pan added that the CLA will respect any conclusions made by the
committee.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Several non-governmental groups urged the Legislative Yuan Friday to enact
"sunshine laws" as soon as possible in order to establish clean politics and
sound governance, in a response to allegations the that former first family
funneled large sums of cash into Swiss bank accounts.</P>
      <P>Hung Yu-hung, chief coordinator of the Constitution Reform Alliance, and Ku
Chung-hwa, chairman of the Alliance of Citizen Congress Watch, called on the
Legislative Yuan to swiftly pass the sunshine laws so as to tackle the issue of
corruption from within the system. They issued the call at a seminar entitled
"Do Not Forget the Power of Citizen Watch," hosted by the Taiwan Thinktank.</P>
      <P>Former President Chen Shui-bian admitted last Thursday that he had lied about
the campaign expenses for his two mayoral elections and two presidential
elections between 1993 and 2004 and that his wife had wired surplus campaign
contributions into overseas bank accounts held by members of his family.</P>
      <P>His confession came only after the Foreign Ministry confirmed earlier that same
day that Swiss authorities had sought Taiwan's help in a probe into a possible
money laundering case in Switzerland involving Chen's son Chen Chih-chung and
daughter-in-law Huang Jui-ching.</P>
      <P>The former president claimed that his wife Wu Shu-jen made the wire transfers
without his knowledge.</P>
      <P>Hung contended that the Legislative  Yuan should pass the "Property With Unknown
Source Act" as soon as possible in its next session, given the fact that so far
there is no evidence to prove that Chen is guilty of corruption, but rather is
"morally bankrupt."</P>
      <P>"The law should be made retroactive so that all political figures could be
scrutinized, " Hung said." It would not be a bad thing if the Democratic
Progressive Party and Kuomintang lost half of their members because it would
mean that the country could start afresh with clean governance."</P>
      <P>Ku said politicians in power should be able to resist temptation and they should
be held to a higher moral standard, as that is the key to an honest government.</P>
      <P>"From a broader and more positive perspective, the Chen scandal might serve as
an opportunity for Taiwan's democracy to get rid of long-lasting problems," Ku
said.</P>
      <P>Urging the KMT to take a more open attitude toward a planned protest for Aug.
30, the participants at the seminar said that the event is not targeted at
President Ma Ying-jeou, but rather is a demonstration of the power of citizen
watch.</P>
      <P>They said the main objectives of the protest are to push for the swift passage
of sunshine laws, to call on the general public to stand up and take
responsibility for monitoring the government and to encourage the DPP to rise up
powerfully and spiritedly to fill the role of safeguarding the interests of the
people of Taiwan.</P>

      <P>Taiwan ranked second in the latest online government survey by U.S.-based Brown
University, moving one notch higher since the ranking last year, according to a
statement by the Research, Development and Evaluation Commission under the
Executive Yuan.</P>
      <P>Taiwan trailed South Korea but led the other 96 countries in the study, which
was conducted during June and July. A total of 1,667 government Web sites were
analyzed based on many criteria, including the contents of central government
Web sites, disability access, the presence of privacy policies, security
policies, contact information, foreign-language options, advertisement and user
fees, and the number of online services.</P>
      <P>Under a 0-100 point scoring system, Taiwan received full marks in the rating for
offering online publications, announcement of privacy and security policies, and
foreign-language options.</P>
      <P>Taiwan was given a score of 58.7 in the general e-government rating, lagging
behind South Korea's 64.7 points but beating the United States' score of 53.7
points -- the top three in the annual Brown University rating.</P>
      <P>The government statement attributed the achievement to efficiency in the
promotion of data opening.</P>
      <P>According to a study by the commission, in Taiwan more than 13 million people
ages 12 and older use the Internet, and the time they spend surfing the net was
found to surpass 2.4 hours a day on average.</P>
      <P>The Internet has become one of major channels for mutual communications between
residents in Taiwan and the central and local governments,  the statement  said,
noting  that  the public's satisfaction with e-government services has reached
62 percent.</P>
      <P>To further upgrade online government services, the commission said that the
Executive Yuan has prepared a new four-year improvement program (2008-2011) with
three major goals, including actively serving public needs, reinforcing social
care, and boosting network interactions.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EPA sets higher goal on 21st founding anniversary</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  22 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>On the 21st founding anniversary of the Environmental Protection Administration
(EPA) Friday, EPA deputy minister Chang Tzi-chin called for the upgrading of the
agency to a Cabinet-level  organization  --  the Ministry  of Environmental
Resources.</P>
      <P>One of President Ma Ying-jeou's campaign promises was to turn the EPA into a
ministry of environmental resources that would integrate affairs relating to the
environment, agriculture, forestry, ocean resources, geology, meteorology,
national park management and soil and water conservation into a single ministry.</P>
      <P>However, such a transformation requires legislative approval. According to an
EPA official, a draft amendment to the Organic Law of the Executive Yuan might
be sent to the Legislative Yuan for review next year.</P>
      <P>If the EPA's administrative level is raised,  inter-agency coordination will be
streamlined and institutionalized, which in turn will enhance efficiency, said
Chang in a telephone interview, adding that many environmental problems can be
minimized in the planning stage.@@</P>
      <P>"But such a big machine also raises concern over its actual operation," Chang
said, adding that the specific authority of the new ministry would have to be
well defined by legislation.</P>
      <P>The EPA is itself an upgrade from the previous Environmental Protection Bureau
under the Department of Health that took place in 1987, when martial law had
just been lifted.@@</P>
      <P>Now that the EPA has made progress in raising people's awareness of ecology and
environmental protection, the first EPA Minister Eugene Chien said the agency
will have a broader  vision in formulating policies once its administrative
level is raised.</P>
      <P>"Currently, the EPA's work is still `downstream, ' such as pollution
inspections, " said Chien, who serve in the EPA from 1987 to 1991. "We expect to
be able to solve problems at their points of origin when the administrative
level is raised, "he went on.</P>
      <P>@Looking back on the EPA's development, the agency has made progress, although
the road has been bumpy, said Chien.@@</P>
      <P>Since the 1980s, when Taiwan was performing its "economic miracle, " the
environment has been seriously damaged -- the cost of rapid economic development
-- and people began to form organizations to combat the environmental pollution
that is often a side effect of high-tech factories, said Chien,  citing the
notable cases of movements against the DuPont company and against the Formosa
Plastic Group's naphtha cracking plants.@@</P>
      <P>The U.S.-based DuPont had planned to set up a chemical factory in Changhua
County, central Taiwan, in 1985. The plan was strongly opposed by local people,
who were concerned about the environmental impact of the pollutants emitted by
the factory and the company eventually abandoned the project in 1987.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>St. Lucia, one of Taiwan's diplomatic allies in the West Indies, is seeking
closer medical cooperation to further cement bilateral ties, according to a
press release e-mailed to the CNA Washington Office Thursday.</P>
      <P>The press release issued by the Republic of China Embassy in Castries, St. Lucia
said that St. Lucia's Health Minister Keith Mondesir presided over a ceremony
held at Victoria Hospital in the nation's capital of Castries earlier this
month, in which he received a batch of drugs and medical equipment donated by
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The press release quoted Mondesir as saying that St. Lucia should learn from
Taiwan, particularly in terms of its national health insurance system, which is
world-renowned for its sound design and application, as well as its generous
coverage of the great majority of the public.</P>
      <P>Mondesir said St. Lucia should also seek closer cooperation with Taiwan in
training St. Lucia's medical professionals and personnel, according to the press
release.</P>
      <P>Also speaking at the ceremony, Felix St. Hill, St. Lucia's deputy health
minister, offered his gratitude to Taiwan for sending a mobile medical team to
St. Lucia to launch a free medical service mission this month.</P>
      <P>The nine-member team, organized by the International Cooperation and Development
Fund (ICDF) under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, provided medical care and
exchanged views with medical professionals in St. Lucia on clinical experiences
and techniques during its stay, according to Tom Chou , ROC Ambassador to St.
Lucia.</P>
      <P>The team, composed of surgeons, physicians, pharmacists and nurses from Changhua
Christian Hospital, the Chi Mei Foundation Medical Center and Mackay Memorial
Hospital, served at St. Jude's Hospital and Community Hospital, both located in
southern St. Lucia.</P>
      <P>Team members also traveled to Victoria Hospital in the north for clinical
exchanges with doctors there. In addition, according to an ICDF official, a
doctor of traditional Chinese medicine joined the team for the first time to
promote traditional Chinese medication and therapies, including acupuncture and
cupping, to the country.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's sports authorities were urged Friday to adjust the direction of their
athletic nurturing policies for athletes being groomed to compete
internationally.</P>
      <P>Legislative Yuan Vice Speaker Tseng Yung-chuan, who doubles as vice chairman of
the Chinese Taipei Olympic Committee, said sports circles should probably
consider adjusting their training direction to help Taiwan perform better in
world competition.</P>
      <P>He made the suggestion after Taiwan managed to win only four bronze medals at
the Beijing Olympic Games, which are scheduled to close Sunday, with a score
standing of 71 as of Thursday -- almost at the bottom of the score standings of
all the participating nations that have won one or more medals at this year's
games.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the largely lackluster performances by Taiwanese athletes at the
games -- two bronze medals in taekwondo and two in weightlifting -- Tseng said
Taiwan should probably consider training more athletes in sports like shooting,
which offered 42 gold medals at the Asian Games.</P>
      <P>"The shooting events impose no age, height or weight restrictions on the
contenders and the discipline has a high `investment return rate, '" Tseng said.</P>
      <P>"Once a policy is set, potential national team athletes could be trained from
the junior high school stage, " he said, adding that it would cost little in
terms of training national team players, but would have a major influence on
results.</P>
      <P>As for the performances of the men's and women's taekwondo athletes being poorer
this year than originally expected, Tseng suggested that in future, the fighters
be given more opportunities to receive training abroad and to compete with
foreign athletes to increase their experience and strength for international
competition.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Former President Chen Shui-bian said Friday that his son will return to Taiwan
to face a probe into suspected money-laundering by members of the former first
family, but he didn't say when.</P>
      <P>The former president made the remarks during a lunch meeting with Rotary members
Friday, according to Hsieh Tien-fu, a Rotary of Taipei Northgate member.</P>
      <P>Chen addressed the Rotary members for about 10 minutes. He seemed to be in a
serene mood and "didn't go to extra lengths to defend himself," according to
Hsieh.</P>
      <P>The former president was quoted as having told Rotary members that he has been
"stingy" in the use of money and managed to accumulate some money in every
election.</P>
      <P>Hsieh quoted Chen as saying that he "has contributed  to individual candidates
and the Democratic Progressive Party in every election, " and that his
"contributions to the party have exceeded NT$300 million."</P>
      <P>Hsieh said that Chen thinks a political figure should not have to explain
details about contributions to the party or candidates.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors went to the former president's residence in the posh Hsinyi district
again Friday, to ask the former first lady Wu Shu-jen about the source and flow
of sums of US$21 million stashed in overseas bank accounts by members of Chen's
family.</P>
      <P>The former president and his wife, as well as Wu's older brother Wu Ching-mao,
Chen's son Chen Chih-chung and his daughter-in-law Huang Jui-ching, have been
listed as suspects by prosecutors in the alleged money-laundering case. Chen
Shui-bian, Wu Hsu-jen and Wu Ching-mao have also been barred from leaving the
country.</P>
      <P>Chen Chih-chung, along with his wife, left for the United States Aug. 9 to
pursue advanced studies. But he failed to attend the compulsory orientation at
the University of Virginia School of Law and his whereabouts are unknown.</P>
      <P>The Special Investigation Division under the Supreme Prosecutors Office, in
charge of the probe into the suspected money-laundering case, confirmed Friday
that it has issued subpoenas to Chen Chih-chung and Huang Jui-ching, requesting
them to appear before the prosecutors.</P>
      <P>During a search of Chen Shui-bian's residence last Saturday, prosecutors advised
the former president to persuade his son to return  to Taiwan  to clear  up
doubts  about the suspected money-laundering.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has received a positive response to its requests for judicial  assistance
from Switzerland  and Singapore  in the investigation of the case of suspected
money laundering by members of the former first family.</P>
      <P>A local magazine, based on a report by the international anti-money laundering
organization the Egmont Group, claimed last week that Huang Jui-ching had
laundered money for the former first family by secretly wiring NT$300 million
overseas in 2006, after the exposure of a "state affairs fund" embezzlement case
that implicated Chen Shui-bian and his wife.</P>
      <P>The report allegedly detailed the status of bank accounts created by members of
Chen Shui-bian's family in other countries, including the United States, the
Cayman Islands, Singapore and Switzerland.</P>
      <P>The former president was forced to admit Aug. 14 that he did not fully account
for election campaign expenses during his two mayoral elections and two
presidential elections between 1993 and 2004, but claimed that he was unaware,
until early this year, that the surplus funds had been wired abroad by his wife.</P>
      <P>Chen Shui-bian rejected allegations  that the funds wired overseas  could be
connected  to the "state  affairs  funds" embezzlement case and a botched
attempt by the Taiwan government to win Papua New Guinea as a diplomatic ally.</P>
      <P>Wu Shu-jen stressed last Saturday that all the money deposited overseas had been
obtained legally from four sources -- surplus campaign funds, Chen Shui-bian's
practice as a lawyer before he went into politics, her own dowry and her
investments.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's real wage dropped 2.36 percent in the first half of this year because
of high inflation, according to statistics released Friday by the Directorate
General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS).</P>
      <P>It was the biggest drop since 1980, according to the DGBAS.</P>
      <P>The tallies showed that the regular wages registered an increase of 1.44 percent
in the January-June period, compared with the same period in 2007.</P>
      <P>The growth, however, was offset by a 3.89 percent annual surge in the consumer
price index (CPI) in this first half of this year, the DGBAS said at a press
conference it held earlier in the day, noting that because of the CPI growth,
real wages saw the largest decline in 28 years.</P>
      <P>The DGBAS also pointed out that the number of employed population reached 2.34
million in the first seven months of this year, increasing 235,000 persons from
the same period in 2007.</P>
      <P>Analyzing the education levels of employees in the country, Huang Chien-chung, a
DGBAS deputy department chief said the percentage of employees graduating from
university or higher educational institutes increased to 22.5 percent in the
Jan.-July period of this year from 10.8 percent in the same period of 1998.</P>
      <P>The growth in people graduating from university or higher educational institutes
over the past 10 years has, however, resulted in an increase in jobless for

      <P>The Taiwan AIDS Foundation launched a campaign Friday inviting the public to
wear clothing or colored nails carrying logos and pictures promoting safe sex
and the prevention of AIDS.</P>
      <P>The foundation announced the campaign at a news conference that same day, during
which college students, wearing skirts that were decorated with condoms and red
ribbons, displayed their colored nails carrying five logos designed by the
foundation to convey its ideas related to AIDS prevention.</P>
      <P>According to an executive of the foundation, the designs have different
meanings. For example, the "angel's wings" and "love" symbolize the wish of
giving hope and care to AIDS patients, and the "no HIV" design is expected to
increase people's awareness of AIDS prevention.</P>
      <P>Huang Yen-fang, a deputy section chief in the Centers for Disease Control who
also attended the news conference to support the drive, said Taiwan has more
than 16,000 HIV-positive citizens, 70 percent of whom are between the ages of
20-39. Worse still, 482 of them are aged between 10-19. He called on the public
to use condoms during sex to prevent further HIV infection.</P>
      <P>The foundation encouraged the public, especially young people to use these tiny
little designs of colored nails or to create their own that convey similar ideas
and put them on objects in daily life to support the activity.</P>
      <P>Foundation Chairman Shih Po-nan expressed hope that the campaign will help end
discrimination and fear of AIDS patients, and underscore the importance of safe
sex.</P>
      <P>He also said that after the new school year begins, the foundation will invite
college volunteers who have joined the foundation's summer anti-AIDS publicity
work to give speeches on campus to strengthen its promotion of knowledge about
AIDS among students and young adults.</P>

      <P>The Taichung Public Prosecutors Office in central Taiwan indicted Justin Huang,
a legislator of the ruling Kuomintang (KMT), Friday on charges of taking bribes
between 2004 and 2005 during his previous legislative term.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors said they were seeking a 10-year sentence for Huang, who was
indicted for accepting over NT$2 million (US$63,640) in bribes from two
pharmaceutical companies to lobby on their behalf.</P>
      <P>According to the prosecutors, one of the pharmaceutical companies paid Huang
NT$500,000, via his volunteer aide Chang Jui-po, after Huang helped to have the
company's products included on the regular procurement list of the Cabinet-level
Veterans Affairs Commission.</P>
      <P>Huang also received another NT$500,000 through his aide from a second
pharmaceutical company for helping it to obtain approval from the Bureau of
National Health Insurance (BNHI) to change the brand-name of one of the
company's products. The BNHI also agreed to pay the price the company sought for
filled prescriptions of the medicine.</P>
      <P>The KMT lawmaker later used dummy employee accounts to accept more NT$1 million
in "salaries" paid by the two companies.</P>
      <P>Huang said he could not understand why the prosecutors chose to indict him two
years after the start of the investigation, adding that he would fight the case
to prove his innocence.</P>

    <HEADLINE>'Fighting to death at Olympics an honor': female taekwondo athlete</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>"If I could have fought to the death at the Olympic Games, it would have been an
honor, " said Friday Taiwan's outstanding taekwondo athlete Su Li-wen, who
continued fighting in three matches in Beijing Thursday despite the serious
injuries she suffered in the first match.</P>
      <P>She nevertheless warned other athletes that she had "actually set the wrong
example" by continuing to compete despite a bone fracture and possibly torn
ligaments.</P>
      <P>Su was defeated by Croatia's Martina Zubcic 4-5 in the Olympics bronze medal
match in the women's 57 kg class.</P>
      <P>With an injured left foot, Su surprisingly tied with Zubcic 4-4 after the first
three rounds, but lost a decisive point in an extra tie-breaking round.</P>
      <P>During the match, Su managed to continue fighting even though she collapsed to
the ground several times in obvious pain. In the three matches she fought, she
fell a total of 11 times.</P>
      <P>Although she failed to win a medal, her perseverance drew praise and cheers from
people both in Beijing and Taipei.</P>
      <P>Su's perseverance even prompted Chinese critics to criticize China's defending
110-meter hurdles Olympic champion Liu Xiang, who decided to pull out of the
event due to pain from an inflamed hamstring, as lacking such spirit.</P>
      <P>The doctor for the Taiwan Olympic team, however, said that Su will require
surgery to repair her injuries when she returns to Taiwan. She sustained a
fracture of the fourth toe of her left foot and possibly torn ligaments in her
left knee.</P>
      <P>Su said that after she beat Robin Cheong of New Zealand 1-0 in the second match,
her coach Lee Dong-wan asked her not to compete in the following bronze medal
match.</P>
      <P>Lee had warned her that he would throw in the towel if she lagged two points
behind her rival, Su disclosed.</P>
      <P>During the bronze medal match, Su recalled, she was once two points behind, but
soon drew even with her rival because she did not want her coach to throw in the
towel, which would signify that she was quitting due to injuries.</P>
      <P>"Even if my coach had thrown in the towel, I would have thrown it back," she
said.</P>
      <P>In the extra round, Su thought she had scored a point when she and her rival
exchanged kicks. However, she fell to the ground immediately after the exchange,
and upon learning that the point had been given to her rival, she burst into
tears.</P>
      <P>"It was the first time that I ever cried in an international competition," Su
recalled.</P>
      <P>Before the competition,  the U.S.-based  Sports Illustrated magazine described
the 27-year-old Su as the only Taiwanese athlete capable of winning a gold for
her country.</P>
      <P>Su won gold at the 2006 Asian Games in Doha, the 2007 World University  Games
in Bangkok  and the 2008  Asian  Taekwondo Championship.</P>
      <P>Su, who disclosed that she will retire after the Beijing Games, recalled that
she could barely stand after the second match, but said she never thought about
quitting.</P>
      <P>"It would be worth fighting to the death at such a premier event, " she said."I
had been working so hard and Taiwan has so many taekwondo athletes. As a
veteran, I have the obligation to persist to the end."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) Chairman Ching Pin-kung said Friday that trade
issues will be the focus of cross-Taiwan Strait consultations next year.</P>
      <P>Chiang made the remarks during a board meeting of the SEF, a semi-official body
set up by Taiwan to handle exchanges with China.</P>
      <P>At the top on the agenda next year will be a supervisory cooperative mechanism
between banks across the Taiwan Strait and related issues, the signing of an
investment guarantee agreement, and the signing of an agreement to avoid double
taxation, Chiang said.</P>
      <P>Looking ahead, Chiang expressed the hope that his counterpart, Chen Yunlin,
chairman of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS), will
visit Taiwan later this year for a second round of talks between the SEF and the
ARATS.</P>
      <P>He said the SEF and the Mainland Affairs Council, Taiwan's top coordinating
agency on China policy, are now busy preparing for Chen's upcoming visit, and
are hoping that he will sense the Taiwan people's "sincerity and goodwill."</P>
      <P>Chiang also said this year's cross-strait consultations will focus on
"transportation" issues. These will include increasing in the number of weekend
charter flights, opening more direct flight destinations in China than the
current five, adding new direct flight routes, launching cross-strait cargo
charter flights, establishing direct shipping links and expanding direct links
between the outlying islands of Kinmen and Matsu and China's Fujian province.</P>
      <P>In addition, the consultations will focus on cross-strait cooperation in areas
such as crime fighting, oil exploration, climate change and weather research,
earthquake research and disaster prevention.</P>
      <P>A landmark meeting between Chiang and Chen in June this year in Beijing signaled
a thawing of cross-strait relations which had been frozen for a decade.</P>
      <P>During Chiang's four-day visit to Beijing in mid-June, he signed two cross-
strait cooperation agreements with Chen on the launch of weekend direct cross-
strait charter flights and the admission of more Chinese tourists to Taiwan,
starting July 18.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Education (MOE) said Friday that Taiwanese students won two gold
medals, one silver and one bronze in the 20th International Olympiad in
Informatics (IOI) in Cairo, Egypt, the same result as last year.</P>
      <P>The primary goal of the annual IOI is to stimulate students' interest  in
informatics  (computing  science)  and information technology, and to bring
together exceptionally talented students from different countries and provide
them with a channel through which they can share scientific and cultural
experiences.</P>
      <P>The delegation of four students -- Yang Han-jie, Wu Zhe-yang, Hsu You-cheng, and
Chen Shuo-fu -- was trained by Ho Rong-guey, a professor at the Graduate
Institute of Information and Computer Education at National Taiwan Normal
University (NTNU) , with the assistance of Greg Lee, Wu Cheng-chih, Wang Ting-
chi and Chen Ling-jyh, professors at NTNU, National Tsing Hua University and
Academia Sinica.</P>
      <P>According to an MOE official, Yang, a silver medalist in last year's IOI,
graduated from the Taipei Municipal Jianguo High School in June and has been
admitted to the Department of Electrical Engineering at National Taiwan
University (NTU).</P>
      <P>Wu is set to enter the National Tainan First Senior High School, the official
went on, while Hsu will enter his third year at the Affiliated Senior High
School of National Taiwan Normal university.</P>
      <P>Hsu recalled that his interest for program designing was sparked one day in
elementary school when a computer virus destroyed all his documents and a
favorite computer game. Since then, he has vowed to design his own computer
games.</P>
      <P>Chen graduated from the Kaohsiung Municipal Kaohsiung Senior High School this
year and will enter his freshman year at the NTU's Department of Computer
Science and Information  Engineering in September, said the MOE official.</P>
      <P>According to the MOE official, gold medalists Yang and Wu, silver medal winner
Hsu and bronze medalist Chen will be awarded NT$200,000 (US$6,370), NT$100,000

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's gross domestic product (GDP) is expected to grow 4.3 percent year-on-
year for 2008 and the inflation rate is likely to hit a 14-year high of 3.74
percent,  the government's top statistical agency predicted Friday.</P>
      <P>Tsai Hung-kun, chief of the third department of the Directorate General of
Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) , unveiled the agency's forecast on
the country's economic prospects for 2008 and the coming year at a press
conference.</P>
      <P>Tsai said the record high increase in the consumer price index (CPI) was
estimated based on crude oil prices estimated by the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC) . The average price of crude oil for 2008 was set by
OPEC at US$112.9 per barrel.</P>
      <P>For next year, the CPI annual growth will be only 1.91 percent, as OPEC crude
oil price is forecast to rise by an average 3.3 percent for 2009, Tsai said.</P>
      <P>Tsai explained that the CPI growth forecast for 2009 was made based on an
expected average of US$116.6 per barrel in 2009 for OPEC crude, after the West
Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil price dropped to US$120 per barrel the previous day
from a record high of US$140 per barrel. WTI, also known as Texas Light Sweet,
is used as a benchmark in oil pricing and the underlying commodity of New York
Mercantile Exchange's oil futures contracts.</P>
      <P>Thanks to the oil price drop, Tsai said, the hikes in the domestic prices of
commodities, which began last year and reached a peak in the third quarter of
this year, are expected to slow down in the fourth quarter.</P>
      <P>The DGBAS also forecast the GDP will grow by 5.08 percent for 2009, falling
short of the 6 percent projected by President Ma Ying-jeou in his presidential
campaign ahead of the March 22 election.</P>
      <P>DGBAS Director-General Shih Su-mei said the 2009 GDP growth could be revised
upward if the government succeeds in attracting more private investments.</P>

      <P>The total investment in the Kaohsiung Software Technology Park as of late August
reached nearly NT$1.8 billion (US$57.19 million), the Export Processing Zone
Administration of the Ministry of Economic Affairs disclosed Friday.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for the administration said the investment came from 56 approved
investors who have decided to set up shop in the software park, and that the
amount represented a substantial increase from the NT$12.2 billion recorded in
June.</P>
      <P>Of the accumulated total of NT$1.8 million, NT$713 million was invested in the
first eight months of this year by 23 companies, according to the spokesman.</P>
      <P>More investment is expected to pour into the park, as some 30 other companies
have also expressed interest in setting up shop there, including the Hon Hai
Group, the largest manufacturer of connectors for use in personal computers in
Taiwan and a leading manufacturer of connectors and cable assemblies in the
world.</P>
      <P>Hon Hai Group Chairman Terry Gou signed a letter of intent with Minister of
Economic Affairs Yiin Chii-ming in early June to invest in the park, with a plan
to create some 3,000 jobs for software engineers.</P>
      <P>The 7.9-hectare software park, located in the southern port city of Kaohsiung,

    <TEXT>
      <P>Former President Chen Shui-bian said Friday that the money-laundering
allegations against him are politically motivated and that he did not privately
pocket any money.</P>
      <P>Chen admitted Aug. 14 that his wife had wired abroad an unspecified amount of
money that he had received as campaign contributions during his four bids for
election to public office in the period from 1993 to 2004.</P>
      <P>However, he said in a statement Friday that although his wife Wu Shui-jen had
wired the money without informing him in advance, she later told him that the
money was neither for their personal use, nor for that of their offspring.</P>
      <P>According to Wu, the funds transferred abroad were slated to be used by Chen to
promote Taiwan's diplomatic and public affairs after he left the office on May
20 this year, the former president said.</P>
      <P>Chen stated that his wife's methods may have been wrong, but not her motives.</P>
      <P>Chen argued that he did not need to "launder the money" because "the money was
clean."</P>
      <P>He accused the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) of seeking to penalize him over the years
because it thinks he "usurped" its right to the country. The KMT governed Taiwan
for nearly 50 years prior to 2000 when Chen and his Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) won the presidential election for the first time.</P>
      <P>Chen said many people in Taiwan could not accept that he had won a second term
in 2004 and they attempted to use many scandals to get him out of office.</P>
      <P>Over the past eight years, he said, he provided funds to the DPP and its
nominees when they needed money for election campaigns.</P>
      <P>He recalled that he donated a total of NT$340 million (US$10.8 million) to the
DPP in the 2000 and 2004 presidential campaigns.</P>
      <P>He said that he and other politicians had all failed to truthfully report their
election funds to the government.</P>
      <P>For example, Chen's predecessor Lee Teng-hui once admitted that he spent NT$2.5
billion for the 1996 presidential election, but reported only NT$290 million.
Former KMT Chairman Lien Chan and current President Ma Ying-jeou of the KMT also
incorrectly reported their campaign funds, he charged.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Former-first lady says overseas funds came from election surplus</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  22 (CNA)
08/22/08  23:47:18

    <TEXT>
      <P>Former first lady Wu Shu-jen said Friday that the US$21 million in overseas
banking accounts under the names of her family members came from surplus funds
from election campaigns of her husband.</P>
      <P>Wu told prosecutors investigating the suspected money-laundering case involving
her family members that all the money was obtained legally.</P>
      <P>Wu said the US$21 million in the overseas banking accounts under the name of Wu
Ching-mao, her elder brother, and Huang Jui-ching, her daughter-in-law, was the
balance of political contributions for the campaigns of former President Chen
Shui-bian in two mayoral elections and two presidential elections from 1993 to
2004.</P>
      <P>"There is nothing illegitimate about the source of the money," Wu said.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors from the Special Investigation Division under the Supreme
Prosecutors Office said that Wu's statement was at odds with her response
Saturday when prosecutors first questioned her at the former president's
residence in the posh Hsinyi District in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Wu said on Saturday that the money came from four sources -- surplus campaign
funds, Chen's lucrative earnings as a lawyer before he went into politics,  her
own dowry and investments.  The prosecutors also said that Wu's statement did
not match the evidence they have collected, and that further thorough checks
will be required.</P>
      <P>"If necessary, the prosecutors will summon Chen Shu-bian and Wu's elder brother
Wu Ching-mao for further questioning," said one prosecutor, who preferred
anonymity.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors  asked Wu to provide relevant  information concerning the flow
of money, but said she has not offered any evidence to support her claims.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors  also suspect that there may have been a connection between the
overseas funds and a foundation that Wu once headed, and have asked her to
clearly explain that possible link.</P>
      <P>The Formosa Foundation, which was chaired by Wu once, solicited political
donations during each of Chen's election campaigns.</P>
      <P>The foundation, which is dedicated to the advancement of human rights,
democracy, and Taiwan's right to self-determination, has a current fund of NT$5
million -- exactly the same amount as when it was founded in 1987.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors confirmed Friday that they issued two subpoenas Wednesday to
Chen Shui-bian's son Cheng Chih-chung and Cheng's wife Huang Jui-ching, both of
whom left for the United States Aug. 9.</P>
      <P>In an effort to obtain a more complete picture of the alleged money laundering
case, the prosecutors are seeking written permission from Wu Ching-mao to
examine his bank accounts in Singapore and Switzerland, but Wu has yet to give
consent.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors have asked the former first lady to persuade her brother to
cooperate in the investigation of the case.</P>
      <P>The matter came to light when a local magazine, based on a report by the
international anti-money laundering organization, the Egmont Group, claimed last
week that Huang Jui-ching had laundered money for the former first family by
secretly wiring NT$300 million overseas in 2006 after the exposure of a "state
affairs fund" embezzlement case that implicated Chen Shui-bian and his wife.</P>
      <P>The report detailed the status of overseas bank accounts allegedly held by
members of Chen Shui-bian's family, in countries that include the United States,
the Cayman Islands, Singapore and Switzerland.</P>
      <P>The former president and his wife, as well as Wu's older brother Wu Ching-mao,
Chen's son Chen Chih-chung and his daughter-in-law Huang Jui-ching, have been
listed as suspects by prosecutors in the alleged money-laundering case. Chen
Shui-bian, Wu Hsu-jen and Wu Ching-mao have also been barred from leaving the
country.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Kaohsiung mayor hails acquittal of municipal officials</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  Aug.  22 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu hailed the acquittal of 21 city government officials
and municipal sanitation workers Friday of election bribery charges, saying that
justice has finally prevailed.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks after the Kaohsiung District Court ruled earlier in the
day that Hsiao Yu-cheng, a former head of the southern port city's Bureau of
Environmental Protection, and the 20 other municipal officials and sanitation
workers were not guilty of charges of conducting vote-buying activities ahead of
the Jan. 12 legislative elections.</P>
      <P>"I'm very glad to see all of the defendants cleared of the vote buying charges,
" Chen said, adding that she believes in their innocence from the very
beginning.</P>
      <P>Hsiao was indicted in February on charges of vote buying in an attempt to help
then-Democratic Progressive Party Legislator Lee Kun-tse get re-elected in the
legislative polls. Prosecutors demanded a 14-year prison term for Hsiao, plus
the stripping of his civil rights for 10 years after he serves the sentence.</P>
      <P>Upon learning of the "not guilty" ruling,  Hsiao said he appreciates the court's
move to clear his name and his colleagues' reputation.</P>
      <P>Hsiao was detained Nov. 24, 2007 and held for more than one month for alleged
vote-buying activities. The prosecutors accused him of spending  NT$14,400  of
his office funds to treat 17 of his subordinates -- mostly heads of street
cleaning squads in the city's Sanmin District -- to a dinner in a restaurant in
November, asking them to vote for Lee Kun-tse.</P>
      <P>Hsiao insisted he was innocent, saying that he was merely entertaining the
sanitation workers in appreciation of their efforts in helping the city to bring
a dengue fever outbreak under control.</P>
      <P>"I feel sorry for getting grassroots sanitation staff involved in grueling
litigation procedures, " an emotional Hsiao said after learning of the acquittal
ruling. "It's great as the clouds finally clear up."</P>
      <P>Hsiao, who was removed from his environmental bureau chief post to a city
government advisory position after being indicted, said he has encouraged the
other wrongly accused to continue their service for local citizens. It remains
unclear whether Hsiao will reclaim his previous post.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Investment in Kaohsiung Software Park tops NT$1.79 billion</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  Aug.  22 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The total investment in the Kaohsiung Software Technology Park as of late August
reached nearly NT$1.8 billion (US$57.19 million), the Export Processing Zone
Administration of the Ministry of Economic Affairs disclosed Friday.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for the administration said the investment came from 56 approved
investors who have decided to set up shop in the software park, and that the
amount represented a substantial increase from the NT$12.2 billion recorded in
June.</P>
      <P>Of the accumulated total of NT$1.8 million, NT$713 million was invested in the
first eight months of this year by 23 companies, according to the spokesman.</P>
      <P>More investment is expected to pour into the park, as some 30 other companies
have also expressed interest in setting up shop there, including the Hon Hai
Group, the largest manufacturer of connectors for use in personal computers in
Taiwan and a leading manufacturer of connectors and cable assemblies in the
world.</P>
      <P>Hon Hai Group Chairman Terry Gou signed a letter of intent with Minister of
Economic Affairs Yiin Chii-ming in early June to invest in the park, with a plan
to create some 3,000 jobs for software engineers.</P>
      <P>The 7.9-hectare software park, located in the southern port city of Kaohsiung,
was launched in 2001, with the main focus of developing digital content and
audiovisual technology. It is one of the seven Export Processing Zones in Taiwan
that offer land and facilities to companies dedicated to exports.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GDP growth forecast at 4.3% for 2008: DGBAS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 22 (CNA)
08/23/08  12:24:23
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's gross domestic product (GDP) is expected to grow 4.3 percent year-on-
year for 2008 and the inflation rate is likely to hit a 14-year high of 3.74
percent,  the government's top statistical agency predicted Friday.</P>
      <P>Tsai Hung-kun, chief of the third department of the Directorate General of
Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) , unveiled the agency's forecast on
the country's economic prospects for 2008 and the coming year at a press
conference.</P>
      <P>Tsai said the record high increase in the consumer price index (CPI) was
estimated based on crude oil prices estimated by the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC) . The average price of crude oil for 2008 was set by
OPEC at US$112.9 per barrel.</P>
      <P>For next year, the CPI annual growth will be only 1.91 percent, as OPEC crude
oil price is forecast to rise by an average 3.3 percent for 2009, Tsai said.</P>
      <P>Tsai explained that the CPI growth forecast for 2009 was made based on an
expected average of US$116.6 per barrel in 2009 for OPEC crude, after the West
Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil price dropped to US$120 per barrel the previous day
from a record high of US$140 per barrel. WTI, also known as Texas Light Sweet,
is used as a benchmark in oil pricing and the underlying commodity of New York
Mercantile Exchange's oil futures contracts.</P>
      <P>Thanks to the oil price drop, Tsai said, the hikes in the domestic prices of
commodities, which began last year and reached a peak in the third quarter of
this year, are expected to slow down in the fourth quarter.</P>
      <P>The DGBAS also forecast the GDP will grow by 5.08 percent for 2009, falling
short of the 6 percent projected by President Ma Ying-jeou in his presidential
campaign ahead of the March 22 election.</P>
      <P>DGBAS Director-General Shih Su-mei said the 2009 GDP growth could be revised
upward if the government succeeds in attracting more private investments.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Cross-strait talks next year to focus on trade issues: SEF head</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 22 (CNA)
08/23/08  12:25:04
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) Chairman Ching Pin-kung said Friday that trade
issues will be the focus of cross-Taiwan Strait consultations next year.</P>
      <P>Chiang made the remarks during a board meeting of the SEF, a semi-official body
set up by Taiwan to handle exchanges with China.</P>
      <P>At the top on the agenda next year will be a supervisory cooperative mechanism
between banks across the Taiwan Strait and related issues, the signing of an
investment guarantee agreement, and the signing of an agreement to avoid double
taxation, Chiang said.</P>
      <P>Looking ahead, Chiang expressed the hope that his counterpart, Chen Yunlin,
chairman of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS), will
visit Taiwan later this year for a second round of talks between the SEF and the
ARATS.</P>
      <P>He said the SEF and the Mainland Affairs Council, Taiwan's top coordinating
agency on China policy, are now busy preparing for Chen's upcoming visit, and
are hoping that he will sense the Taiwan people's "sincerity and goodwill."</P>
      <P>Chiang also said this year's cross-strait consultations will focus on
"transportation" issues. These will include increasing in the number of weekend
charter flights, opening more direct flight destinations in China than the
current five, adding new direct flight routes, launching cross-strait cargo
charter flights, establishing direct shipping links and expanding direct links
between the outlying islands of Kinmen and Matsu and China's Fujian province.</P>
      <P>In addition, the consultations will focus on cross-strait cooperation in areas
such as crime fighting, oil exploration, climate change and weather research,
earthquake research and disaster prevention.</P>
      <P>A landmark meeting between Chiang and Chen in June this year in Beijing signaled
a thawing of cross-strait relations which had been frozen for a decade.</P>
      <P>During Chiang's four-day visit to Beijing in mid-June, he signed two cross-
strait cooperation agreements with Chen on the launch of weekend direct cross-
strait charter flights and the admission of more Chinese tourists to Taiwan,
starting July 18.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Former-first lady says overseas funds came from election surplus</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  22 (CNA)
08/23/08  12:25:25
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former first lady Wu Shu-jen said Friday that the US$21 million in overseas
banking accounts under the names of her family members came from surplus funds
from election campaigns of her husband.</P>
      <P>Wu told prosecutors investigating the suspected money-laundering case involving
her family members that all the money was obtained legally.</P>
      <P>Wu said the US$21 million in the overseas banking accounts under the name of Wu
Ching-mao, her elder brother, and Huang Jui-ching, her daughter-in-law, was the
balance of political contributions for the campaigns of former President Chen
Shui-bian in two mayoral elections and two presidential elections from 1993 to
2004.</P>
      <P>"There is nothing illegitimate about the source of the money," Wu said.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors from the Special Investigation Division under the Supreme
Prosecutors Office said that Wu's statement was at odds with her response
Saturday when prosecutors first questioned her at the former president's
residence in the posh Hsinyi District in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Wu said on Saturday that the money came from four sources -- surplus campaign
funds, Chen's lucrative earnings as a lawyer before he went into politics,  her
own dowry and investments.  The prosecutors also said that Wu's statement did
not match the evidence they have collected, and that further thorough checks
will be required.</P>
      <P>"If necessary, the prosecutors will summon Chen Shu-bian and Wu's elder brother
Wu Ching-mao for further questioning," said one prosecutor, who preferred
anonymity.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors  asked Wu to provide relevant  information concerning the flow
of money, but said she has not offered any evidence to support her claims.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors  also suspect that there may have been a connection between the
overseas funds and a foundation that Wu once headed, and have asked her to
clearly explain that possible link.</P>
      <P>The Formosa Foundation, which was chaired by Wu once, solicited political
donations during each of Chen's election campaigns.</P>
      <P>The foundation, which is dedicated to the advancement of human rights,
democracy, and Taiwan's right to self-determination, has a current fund of NT$5
million -- exactly the same amount as when it was founded in 1987.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors confirmed Friday that they issued two subpoenas Wednesday to
Chen Shui-bian's son Cheng Chih-chung and Cheng's wife Huang Jui-ching, both of
whom left for the United States Aug. 9.</P>
      <P>In an effort to obtain a more complete picture of the alleged money laundering
case, the prosecutors are seeking written permission from Wu Ching-mao to
examine his bank accounts in Singapore and Switzerland, but Wu has yet to give
consent.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors have asked the former first lady to persuade her brother to
cooperate in the investigation of the case.</P>
      <P>The matter came to light when a local magazine, based on a report by the
international anti-money laundering organization, the Egmont Group, claimed last
week that Huang Jui-ching had laundered money for the former first family by
secretly wiring NT$300 million overseas in 2006 after the exposure of a "state
affairs fund" embezzlement case that implicated Chen Shui-bian and his wife.</P>
      <P>The report detailed the status of overseas bank accounts allegedly held by
members of Chen Shui-bian's family, in countries that include the United States,
the Cayman Islands, Singapore and Switzerland.</P>
      <P>The former president and his wife, as well as Wu's older brother Wu Ching-mao,
Chen's son Chen Chih-chung and his daughter-in-law Huang Jui-ching, have been
listed as suspects by prosecutors in the alleged money-laundering case. Chen
Shui-bian, Wu Hsu-jen and Wu Ching-mao have also been barred from leaving the
country.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Education (MOE) said Friday that Taiwanese students won two gold
medals, one silver and one bronze in the 20th International Olympiad in
Informatics (IOI) in Cairo, Egypt, the same result as last year.</P>
      <P>The primary goal of the annual IOI is to stimulate students' interest  in
informatics  (computing  science)  and information technology, and to bring
together exceptionally talented students from different countries and provide
them with a channel through which they can share scientific and cultural
experiences.</P>
      <P>The delegation of four students -- Yang Han-jie, Wu Zhe-yang, Hsu You-cheng, and
Chen Shuo-fu -- was trained by Ho Rong-guey, a professor at the Graduate
Institute of Information and Computer Education at National Taiwan Normal
University (NTNU) , with the assistance of Greg Lee, Wu Cheng-chih, Wang Ting-
chi and Chen Ling-jyh, professors at NTNU, National Tsing Hua University and
Academia Sinica.</P>
      <P>According to an MOE official, Yang, a silver medalist in last year's IOI,
graduated from the Taipei Municipal Jianguo High School in June and has been
admitted to the Department of Electrical Engineering at National Taiwan
University (NTU).</P>
      <P>Wu is set to enter the National Tainan First Senior High School, the official
went on, while Hsu will enter his third year at the Affiliated Senior High
School of National Taiwan Normal university.</P>
      <P>Hsu recalled that his interest for program designing was sparked one day in
elementary school when a computer virus destroyed all his documents and a
favorite computer game. Since then, he has vowed to design his own computer
games.</P>
      <P>Chen graduated from the Kaohsiung Municipal Kaohsiung Senior High School this
year and will enter his freshman year at the NTU's Department of Computer
Science and Information  Engineering in September, said the MOE official.</P>
      <P>According to the MOE official, gold medalists Yang and Wu, silver medal winner
Hsu and bronze medalist Chen will be awarded NT$200,000 (US$6,370), NT$100,000
and NT$50,000, respectively, after they return to Taiwan Aug. 28.</P>
      <P>The eight-day Olympiad was scheduled to end Aug. 23 and next year's competition
will be held in Bulgaria, the official noted.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The small pro-unification New Party celebrated its 15th founding anniversary
Saturday in Taipei City, with the party's chairman expressing the hope that
Taiwan can become "an island of peace and a place without war."</P>
      <P>Speaking at the gathering held at the Civil Service Development Institute, Yok
Mu-ming noted that President Ma Ying-jeou has also said he wants the Taiwan
Strait to be free of military conflict.</P>
      <P>However, creating an island of peace cannot be easily achieved and requires the
concerted efforts of all the parties involved, Yok said.</P>
      <P>The New Party has therefore decided to employ innovative thinking and obtain the
public's opinion before working to influence the government's policies and to
realize its goal of lasting peace, he said.</P>
      <P>Also speaking at the gathering, Robert Tsao, honorary chairman of chipmaker
giant United Microelectronics Corp., reiterated his call for a "peaceful co-
existence law" on cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>Tsao said that although the Republic of China on Taiwan is sovereign and
independent, unification with China should not be ruled out.</P>
      <P>However, unification must first be approved by the people of Taiwan through a
referendum, and China must clearly state beforehand its conditions for
unification, he stressed.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan could move toward independence or it could pursue unification with
China, but military conflict is not necessary in either scenario," Tsao said.</P>
      <P>Several top central and local government officials attended the New Party's
anniversary gathering, including Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng,
Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Wu Poh-hsiung, Presidential Office Secretary-General
Chan Chun-po, and Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin.</P>
      <P>KMT legislators Hung Hsiu-chu, Alex Tsai, and Lai Shyh-bao were also at the
gathering.</P>
      <P>Although the New Party has held a limited number of seats in the Legislative
Yuan in the past, it failed to pass the 5-percent threshold to qualify for

    <HEADLINE>Business group criticized over Taipei Dome construction plan</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 23 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The construction plan for the Taipei Dome Complex proposed by the Farglory Group
was strongly criticized by local residents at a seminar Saturday morning, as
they asserted that the real intention is to make a profit from the commercial
facilities that have been included in the plan.</P>
      <P>According to Farglory's plan, the Taipei Dome Complex, or Taipei Culture and
Sports District, will occupy about 18 hectares in the bustling Xinyi district
and will include a 40,000-seat indoor stadium, hotels, department stores,
shopping center and office buildings.</P>
      <P>The complex, located on the site of the Songshan Tobacco Factory, is scheduled
to be completed in 2010. But opposition to the projects and doubts expressed by
local residents have made it difficult for the group to proceed.</P>
      <P>Although the Farglory Group said at the seminar that Taiwan needs an indoor
baseball park to foster the development of the sport, residents living close to
the project rebutted that the area designated for commercial buildings is about
double that for the sports dome.</P>
      <P>"We are not opposed to the construction of a sports arena, but we do not want
those commercial buildings," said Lin Hsue-fang, a member of an alliance that is
advocating the Songshan Tobacco Factory site should be converted into a forest
park instead of a shopping area.</P>
      <P>But the Farglory representatives insisted that in order to maintain the proper
operation of the stadium, a larger area would have to be dedicated to commercial
enterprises.</P>
      <P>The Songshan Tobacco Factory was constructed in 1937 under Japanese colonial
rule. It was designated as a historical monument by the Taipei City Government
in 2001.</P>
      <P>"Farglory should not use baseball as an excuse. If we suffer a setback in our
baseball games at the Olympics, a sumptuous dome is not what would make a
difference, but rather an open space for everyone," Lin argued.</P>
      <P>Local residents also worry that the establishment of a stadium in that area will
result in heavy traffic congestion in the already busy district, and are
contenting that the choice of location was poor.</P>
      <P>"Currently, parking lots within 300 meters of the planned dome are already about
80 percent full on holidays, how can you expect that there will be no problem
with tens of thousands people getting out in the future? " asked Lee Chin-yuan,
a Kuomintang Taipei City Councilor, who was at the seminar.</P>
      <P>The Farglory Group signed a contract with the Taipei City Government in 2006 for
the BOT (build-operate-transfer) project. With the price of raw materials on the
increase, the cost of the project is expected to reach NT$25 billion (US$800
million), according to the Farglory Group.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Seven-year-old Chiu En-chia from the southern Taiwan city of Tainan recently
completed a cycling tour that took him across Germany and Netherlands and earned
him the title of the youngest Taiwanese to complete a cycling trip of more than
1,000 km.</P>
      <P>Chiu, along with his parents, were part of a special tour group that cycled
along the Rhine River from Germany's Frankfurt to Amsterdam in Holland in 29
days, starting June 29, a local newspaper reported Saturday.</P>
      <P>Chiu's parents said they still could not believe that their son, who graduated
from kindergarten this summer, completed the 1,000 km journey in Europe.</P>
      <P>Chiu broke the record of Hsu Chan-jen of Taiwan, who cycled 1,022 km in 30 days
across Germany and Denmark, at the age of nine, with his parents last summer.</P>
      <P>After he returned home, Hsu published an account of his journey, entitled
"Family Travel by Bike -- A Boy's Cycling Diary." The book has inspired many
parents, said Chou Yiao-chue, a teacher at Tung Fang Institute of Technology in
Kaohsiung, southern Taiwan. Chou organized the cycling tour group that was
comprised of more than 60 members, 10 of whom were elementary school students.</P>
      <P>Cycling has become more and more popular in Taiwan over the last few years, with
the biking population reaching 650,000 in 2007 and expected to surge to 1
million this year, according to statistics provided by Giant Bicycle Inc. --
Taiwan's largest bicycle maker.</P>
      <P>A local cycling film, "Island Etude, " directed by En Chen and released in April
2007, further spurred a cycling craze around Taiwan. Inspired by the film, Giant
founder King Liu cycled around the island that year in 15 days, at the age of
73.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's leasing industry business volume reached NT$6.3 billion (US$200.6
million) for June, marking an increase of 13.84 percent over the figure for the
same month a year earlier, according to the latest statistics released Saturday
by the Ministry of Economic Affairs.</P>
      <P>The ministry said that amid tough economic times and shrinking real incomes in
Taiwan, more and more consumers with tighter budgets are opting to lease instead
of buy new products to reduce their spending.</P>
      <P>By sector, the construction machinery equipment leasing industry saw the largest
increase in business volume for June, rising 17.34 percent year-on-year to reach
NT$2.7 billion, followed by consumer products, up 13.99 percent to NT$1.2
billion, and automobile leasing, up 10.22 percent to NT$2.5 billion, according
to the ministry's tallies.</P>
      <P>For the first half of 2008, the leasing industry's business volume amounted to
NT$35.5 billion, up 10.2 percent over the previous year's level, with consumer
product leasing leading the way with a 10.45 percent increase in business, the

    <HEADLINE>Anti-money laundering group says it's not involved in probe</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Egmont Group, an international anti-money laundering network that played a
key role in alerting Taiwan authorities  to a high-profile  case of possible
money laundering embroiling Taiwan's former first family, commented for the
first time on the matter Saturday, saying that its aim is to combat money
laundering but that it is not involved in the probe.</P>
      <P>In response to a CNA inquiry by e-mail, the group, headquartered in Canada,
finally broke its silence 10 days after a scandal that embroiled former
President Chen Shui-bian's family members broke.</P>
      <P>"One of the main goals of the Egmont Group is to create a global network by
promoting international cooperation between 'financial intelligence units'
(FIUs) , " the Egmont Secretariat said in the e-mail, adding that for any
information relating to a specific operational matter the FIU in the relevant
country should be contacted.</P>
      <P>"The Egmont Group does not get involved in such operational matters," the
Secretariat said.</P>
      <P>According to the Egmont Group, FIUs, which provide an important avenue for
information exchange, are entities created by countries around the world to deal
with the problem of money laundering.</P>
      <P>It said operational case matters within a country or between countries may
involve one FIU, or a number of FIUs getting together to follow the money trail,
and is up to each FIU to determine whether it is appropriate for it to seek the
involvement of other FIUs, or for it to be involved in this process.</P>
      <P>Chen admitted last Thursday that he had lied about the campaign expenses for his
two mayoral elections and two presidential elections between 1993 and 2004. He
said that his wife had wired surplus campaign contributions to overseas bank
accounts held by members of his family.</P>
      <P>His confession came only after the Foreign Ministry confirmed earlier that same
day that Swiss authorities had been seeking Taiwan's help in a probe into a
possible money laundering case in Switzerland involving Chen's son Chen Chih-
chung and daughter-in-law Huang Jui-ching.</P>
      <P>The former president, who has been prohibited by prosecutors from leaving the
country, claimed that his wife Wu Shu-jen made the wire transfers without his
knowledge.</P>
      <P>The matter came to light when a local magazine, based on a report by the Egmont
Group, claimed that Huang had laundered money for the former first family by
secretly wiring NT$300 million (US$10 million) overseas in 2006 after the
exposure of a "state affairs fund" embezzlement case that implicated Chen and
his wife.</P>
      <P>The Egmont  Group  was established  in 1995  to stimulate international
cooperation between financial intelligence units, meeting regularly to find ways
to cooperate, especially in the areas of information exchange, training and the
sharing of expertise.</P>
      <P>There are currently 108 countries that are members of the Egmont Group.
Taiwan's Money Laundering  Prevention Center under the Investigation Bureau
joined the network in 1998.</P>
      <P>Noting that governments around the world recognize the "corrosive dangers" that
unchecked financial crimes pose to their economic and political systems, the
Egmont Secretariat explained that FIUs, at a minimum, receive and analyze
information from financial institutions and other reporting entities and after
analyzing the data received, the FIUs may then disclose information relating to
suspicious or unusual financial transactions to the competent authorities.</P>
      <P>The Chen scandal was exposed under such cooperation.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is now actively  seeking judicial  assistance  from Switzerland,
Singapore and the United States in the investigation of the scandal.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan is still assessing the feasibility of developing the carbon capture and
storage (CCS) technique, due to high costs and the possibility of leaks, even as
neighboring Japan is taking steps to launch a huge CCS experiment.</P>
      <P>According to a Japanese newspaper, the Japan government, along with electricity
and oil companies, will initiate a large-scale experiment to store carbon
dioxide, emitted from a coal-fired power plant, in a depleted undersea natural
gas field.</P>
      <P>Under Japan's plan, the carbon dioxide emitted by the coal-fired power plant
will be recycled and piped to the gas field 70 kilometers off Japan's Pacific
coast, the newspaper reported.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, CCS is also considered by some experts as feasible, given that Taiwan
will continue to depend on traditional fossil fuels, according to the Taiwan
Institute of Economic Research.</P>
      <P>However, businesses and the government have so far been reserved about
developing the costly CCS technique.</P>
      <P>"The CCS technique is not a problem. The question is whether the technique will
be of economic benefit to us," said an employee of the CPC Corporation, Taiwan's
largest petroleum company.</P>
      <P>Speaking on condition of anonymity, the CPC employee added that the cost of
moving carbon dioxide from the emission source to a storage location would be
high, and that the possibility of leaks is another concern.@</P>
      <P>"Foreign petroleum companies can profit from developing the CCS technique,
because when greenhouse gases are pumped into depleted oil wells, deposits of
oil at the bottom of the well can be extracted, " Yeh Fung-luh, a senior
specialist of the EPA Department of Air Quality Protection and Noise Control,
told CNA, implying that Taiwan does not have this option.</P>
      <P>In addition, violent earth movements may also cause leaking of stored carbon
dioxide, he said.</P>
      <P>CCS is seen as a means of helping to fight global warming by capturing carbon
dioxide from large sources such as fossil fuel power plants and storing it
instead of releasing it into the atmosphere.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China's representative to the United States said Friday that the
U.S. has assisted Taiwan in locating former President Chen Hsui-bian's son, who
reportedly is a key figure in a case of suspected money laundering involving the
former first family.</P>
      <P>Jason Yuan said that according to his understanding, Chen Chih-chung came to the
United States on a student visa, but because he did not register with the
University of Virginia's law school, his student visa has been revoked.</P>
      <P>Yuan stressed that the United States acted in accordance with the ROC
government's wishes to help locate Chen Chih-chung.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, an official of the University of Virginia said Friday that the school
will refund Cheng Chih-chung's tuition.</P>
      <P>Jeffrey G. Hanna, senior director of the school's public affairs, confirmed that
Chen Chih-chung called Aug. 18 to say that he could not take part in
orientation, and the school told him that his enrollment had been revoked.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the Taiwan media had influenced or pressured the university into
withdrawing Chen Chih-chung's enrollment, Hanna said that as far as he knows,
this was not the case.</P>
      <P>Chen Shui-bian, addressing a Rotary meeting in Taipei Friday, said his son had
already registered with the school, paid the tuition and received a student ID,
but because the Taiwan media kept harassing the university, his son's study
plans fell through.</P>
      <P>Hanna said an enrolled student can pay tuition by means of by checks, wire
transfers or online payments, but since Chen Chih-chung did not register, he
could not have had a student ID.</P>
      <P>Hanna explained that after a student pays the tuition, the school will issue a
"computer digital ID" to the student to select courses, but explained that this
is by no means a "student ID."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, sources said the University of Virginia has notified the U.S.
Citizenship and Immigration Services that Chen Chih-chung has not registered at
the school.</P>
      <P>The sources also said that since Taiwan prosecutors have issued a subpoena to
Chen Chih-chung, he would probably return to face the probe because his student
visa has been revoked and his stay in the United States is now illegal.</P>

      <P>Several researchers  from Japan's nongovernmental Defense Research Center (DRC)
said Saturday in Taipei that Taiwan is Japan's "life line" and that Japan's
security could be at stake if Taiwan were to be annexed by China.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan is situated at a strategic point that is critical to securing the sea
lane on which Japan's survival and prosperity depend, they said, the Japanese
government should seek bilateral political, economic and military cooperation.</P>
      <P>Ueda Naruhiko, DRC executive director and retired lieutenant- general of Japan's
Ground Self-Defense Force; Gomi Mutsuyoshi, DRC researcher and retired Vice
Admiral of Japan's Maritime Self-Defense Force; and Sugiyama Katsumi, DRC
researcher, made the remarks at a seminar held by Taiwan's National Security
Institute and Japan's Asian Security Forum.</P>
      <P>"Whether Taiwan will be annexed by China is a life and death issue to Japan, "
Gomie said. "Taiwan plays the most important role in securing the sea lane on
which Japan's survival and prosperity depend, " he added, referring to Japan's
reliance on the sea lane for the import of energy and various other resources.</P>
      <P>Gomi contended that Taiwan, which holds a significant strategic position, is
crucial to further expansion by China to gain access to the Pacific and Indian
oceans, and therefore China views Taiwan as a must-take place in order to
realize its military ambitions.</P>
      <P>"After swallowing up Taiwan, China will make it an 'anti-access station' against
the United Sates," he said.</P>
      <P>Sugiyama said China covets Taiwan's great economic, financial and industrial
strength and that is why it wants to take Taiwan under its reign.</P>
      <P>He added that in order to achieve that goal, China is not forcing its "one-China
policy" on the Ma Ying-jeou administration, but rather is turning to increased
bilateral economic exchanges so as to gradually dissolve the "psychological
barriers" to reunification.</P>
      <P>"Being both ocean countries, Taiwan and Japan share a 'common destiny' and
should therefore seek dovetailed political, economic and military cooperation,"
Sugiyama said.</P>
      <P>Contending that Taiwan should seek independence in order to help push the
democratization of China and to play an active role in solving regional
conflicts, Sugiyama suggested that Japan become a proactive staunch supporter of
Taiwan in order to achieve regional peace.</P>
      <P>"For that to happen, Taiwan has to be allowed to return to the international
community," he said. "I believe if Taiwan is determined to contribute to world
peace, Japan and the U.S. will also offer their full support for Taiwan to join
the United Nations."</P>
      <P>The Republic of China has tried without success to re-enter the U.N. since 1993,
after losing its seat to the Peoples Republic of China in 1971.</P>
      <P>Noting that Japan's national security is closely linked to Taiwan, Gomi
suggested politicians and the people of Japan should recognize that fact and
work closely with the U.S. in order to protect Japan's national security.</P>
      <P>"If Taiwan is annexed by China, Japan will suffer tremendous economic and
military pressure from China, " Gomi said. "As far as Japan's geopolitics is
concerned, cooperating with the Anglo-America world is the best choice to
safeguard the safety and prosperity of the Japanese people."</P>
      <P>Ueda also advised Japan to maintain close governmental and civil cooperation and
exchanges with Taiwan and the U.S. in order to overcome factors of possible
instability.</P>
      <P>"I am convinced that international relations based on civil cooperation between
Japan, the U.S. and Taiwan -- countries which all value basic human rights --
will be the new motive power of the next generation," he said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A proposal to build Taiwan into a "war-free zone" and an "island of peace" was
harshly criticized Saturday by opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
legislators, who said it would amount to robbing Taiwan of its statehood.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lin Shu-fen said she believes that "peace is built on the ground with
full preparation, " not under conditions that see a country "surrender its
arms."</P>
      <P>The person who proposed the "war-free zone" is a "fool" thinking about his own
wishes, she said. Lin blasted the proposal as an attempt to seek Taiwan's
"progressive unification" with China, and argued that unification is "against
the will of most people in Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Yok Mu-ming, chairman of the pro-unification New Party which is part of the
Kuomintang-led "pan-blue alliance, " raised the proposal at an activity held
earlier in the day to celebrate the New Party's 15th founding anniversary.</P>
      <P>Yok said he hopes President Ma Ying-jeou will devote his efforts to turning
Taiwan into a war-free area and an island of peace.</P>
      <P>Once there is no threat of war between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait and
there is peace in the region, Taiwan should stop purchasing high-performance
weapons from other countries and should disband its air and marine forces, Yok
suggested.</P>
      <P>The savings from Taiwan discontinuing its weapons procurement program could be
used to develop the economy, technology, education and social welfare, he
proposed.</P>
      <P>Yok went public with the proposal in an interview with reporters the previous
day, mentioning the president's pledge of "not seeking unification, independence
or war."</P>
      <P>As a war-free zone, Taiwan would need only to maintain an army -- a basic
military force -- because the National Police can take care of social order,
while the country's coastlines can be secured by the Coast Guard, Yok said.</P>
      <P>In response, DPP Legislator Chiu Yi-ying said that no country in the world would
voluntarily disband its air and marine forces. Besides, she added, China is not
"totally friendly" toward Taiwan, as evidenced by Beijing's reluctance to
dismantle its missiles targeting Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Yok's proposal means surrendering Taiwan's dignity as a country -- in effect
"denationalizing" Taiwan, said Chiu's legislative colleague Chang Hwa-kuan.
Chang described the proposal as "naive, " while Chiu said it was "ridiculous."</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Huang Sue-ying also criticized the suggestion, saying that the
question of peace in the strait is not up to Taiwan to decide, and noted that
China has never stopped trying to squeeze Taiwan out of the international
community.</P>
      <P>If the so-called "war-free zone" proposal was workable, Taiwan would have
declared itself a "neutral state" long time ago, she said, adding that Yok's
remarks were "senseless."</P>

      <P>Three people who were involved in dealing with former President Chen Shui-bian's
campaign funds stated Saturday that Chen's wife Wu Shu-jen was in charge of
managing the funds, and that Chen might not have known how the money was being
used.</P>
      <P>The trio -- Huang Fang-yen, Wu's confidant and deputy superintendent of the Shin
Kong Wu Ho Su Memorial Hospital; former National Security Council Secretary
General Chiou I-jen; and Huang Wei-sheng, chairman of Bian Mao Factory and a big
donor to Chen -- made the statements during questioning by prosecutors from the
Special Investigation Division under the Supreme Prosecutors Office.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors were trying to determine the source and the flow of the campaign
funds, in their investigation into a case of suspected money laundering
involving members of the former first family.</P>
      <P>Chen said last week that the NT$700 million deposited in overseas accounts held
by members of his family was surplus funds from his two mayoral campaigns and
two presidential campaigns in the period from 1993 to 2004. Chen said that his
wife had wired the money overseas without his knowledge, and that he did not
learn of the transfers until early this year.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors learned that Chen would set up a finance committee during each
election campaign, with the campaign contributions handed over to Huang Fang-yen
and Wu. Former China Steel Chairman Lin Wen-yuan was in charge of the campaign
expenses, the prosecutors found.</P>
      <P>In the 2004 presidential election, as Lin was then head of China Steel, a
cashier at the Presidential Office -- Chen Cheng-hui -- was put in charge of the
campaign expenses, the prosecutors said.</P>
      <P>They said that during the presidential campaigns, several large political
donations were turned over directly to Wu in cash, while some donations that
required receipts were given to the Democratic Progressive Party and later
transferred to Chen's campaign headquarters.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors cited Huang as saying that he was not sure about the surplus
campaign funds, and that "only Wu knew how much money was in the fund."</P>
      <P>The reports Chen filed with the Central Election Commission stated that his
campaign expenses in the two presidential elections amounted to NT$900 million
in 2000 and NT$1.2 billion in 2004.</P>
      <P>Chiou also said that Wu was in charge of the use of the funds in the election
campaigns, and Chen "was very likely not aware of how the money was being used."</P>
      <P>Huang Wei-sheng, who was in charge of the spending in Chen's two Taipei mayoral
election campaigns, said that surplus donations amounted to NT$10 million in
1994 and NT$30 million in 1998.</P>
      <P>The high-profiled case came to light when a local magazine, based on a report by
the international anti-money laundering organization, the Egmont Group, claimed
last week that Chen Shui-bian's daughter-in-law, Huang Jui-ching, had laundered
money for the former first family by secretly wiring NT$300 million overseas in
2006 after the exposure of a "state affairs fund" embezzlement case that
implicated Chen Shui-bian and his wife.</P>
      <P>The report detailed the status of overseas bank accounts allegedly held by
members of Chen Shui-bian's family, in countries that include the United States,
the Cayman Islands, Singapore and Switzerland.</P>
      <P>The former president and his wife, as well as Wu's older brother Wu Ching-mao,
Chen's son Chen Chih-chung and Huang Jui-ching, have been listed as suspects by
prosecutors in the alleged money-laundering case. Chen Shui-bian, Wu Hsu-jen and
Wu Ching-mao have also been barred from leaving the country.</P>

    <HEADLINE>President will hold out olive branch in marking 823 battle</HEADLINE>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou will hold out an olive branch in his speech to be
delivered on the outlying island of Kinmen Sunday to mark the 50th anniversary
of the 1958 artillery battle between Taiwan and China, Ma's aides said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Ma's speech, titled "from killing field to peace square, " will stress the need
for the two sides of the Taiwan Strait to nurture good will and mutual  trust to
lay a foundation  for future negotiations of a cross-strait peace agreement,
Presidential Office staff said.</P>
      <P>According to his aides, Ma's speech will be delivered at a commemorative rally
to be held at Chingtien Hall -- a towering hall built inside a mountain -- in
Kinmen where the artillery battle took place. Premier Liu Chao-shiuan and many
other civilian and military officials will also attend the rally.</P>
      <P>"Ma will focus on three key points in his address, " said one of his close aides
who preferred anonymity.</P>
      <P>First, Ma will recognize the artillery battle, which is more commonly known as
823 battle as it began on Aug. 23, 1958, as a "turning point in Taiwan's
history."</P>
      <P>The battle lasted for 44 days during which Communist Chinese artillery troops
hammered the 148 square-kilometer Kinmen island with 500,000 shells.</P>
      <P>Besides expressing his admiration for the late President Chiang Kai-shek's
strategy and determination and for the generous U.S. assistance which combined
to enable Kinmen to withstand the fierce attack, Ma will also reaffirm his
administration's determination to transform Kinmen from a battlefield into a
symbol of peace and make every effort to prevent recurrence of cross-strait war.</P>
      <P>In the second part of his speech, Ma will pitch for deepening of peaceful way of
thinking and strengthening of defense capabilities. Ma will vow to expand cross-
strait exchanges and cooperation in trade, education, cultural development and
international affairs in order to lay a solid foundation for future talks on the
signing of an agreement to perpetuate peace in the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Ma will simultaneously reiterate his commitment to contribute 3
percent of Taiwan's annual GDP to beefing up its defense arsenal. Ma will stress
that the expansion of defense capacity is aimed at deterring, not provoking,
war.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, Ma will express his gratitude for the hardships Kinmen residents
have endured during the artillery battle and their sacrifice in the ensuing
years.</P>
      <P>He will also reaffirm his promise of turning Kinmen into "a peace square of the
21st century" from "a cross-strait killing field of te 20th century."</P>
      <P>To attain that goal,  Ma will unveil mid-  and long-term development plans which
will integrate Kinmen's tourism, industrial and cultural resources to revamp its
economy. Concrete stimulus measures will include review the feasibility of
building a bridge between Kinmen and Xiamen in China's southeastern Fujian
province and allowing imports of water from Xiamen to resolve its water shortage
problems. Kinmen lies closer to Xiamen than to Taiwan proper.</P>

      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan said Saturday he has no plan to replace any Cabinet
member at the moment, even though he feels there is still room for improvement
in its overall performance.</P>
      <P>Liu made the remarks in an interview broadcast live on TVBS, a cable TV channel,
late Saturday.</P>
      <P>Amid the approach of the Cabinet's 100th day in office, criticism has arisen
that Liu's Cabinet  has not lived  up to public expectations, particularly in
inflation control.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the Cabinet's lineup is likely to be adjusted anytime soon, Liu
said that although the Cabinet's performance was less than ideal or fell short
of expectations in some aspects, the overall policy direction is correct.</P>
      <P>"When it comes to Cabinet performance, I care most about direction of policy
initiatives and about whether those initiatives have been executed in the right
direction and are moving closer to projected goals, " Liu explained.</P>
      <P>Generally speaking, Liu went on, the current administrative team is not bad.
"All Cabinet members have worked hard and performed fairly well, even though
there is still some room for improvement, " he added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Three people who were involved in dealing with former President Chen Shui-bian's
campaign funds stated Saturday that Chen's wife Wu Shu-jen was in charge of
managing the funds, and that Chen might not have known how the money was being
used.</P>
      <P>The trio -- Huang Fang-yen, Wu's confidant and deputy superintendent of the Shin
Kong Wu Ho Su Memorial Hospital; former National Security Council Secretary
General Chiou I-jen; and Huang Wei-sheng, chairman of Bian Mao Factory and a big
donor to Chen -- made the statements during questioning by prosecutors from the
Special Investigation Division under the Supreme Prosecutors Office.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors were trying to determine the source and the flow of the campaign
funds, in their investigation into a case of suspected money laundering
involving members of the former first family.</P>
      <P>Chen said last week that the NT$700 million deposited in overseas accounts held
by members of his family was surplus funds from his two mayoral campaigns and
two presidential campaigns in the period from 1993 to 2004. Chen said that his
wife had wired the money overseas without his knowledge, and that he did not
learn of the transfers until early this year.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors learned that Chen would set up a finance committee during each
election campaign, with the campaign contributions handed over to Huang Fang-yen
and Wu. Former China Steel Chairman Lin Wen-yuan was in charge of the campaign
expenses, the prosecutors found.</P>
      <P>In the 2004 presidential election, as Lin was then head of China Steel, a
cashier at the Presidential Office -- Chen Cheng-hui -- was put in charge of the
campaign expenses, the prosecutors said.</P>
      <P>They said that during the presidential campaigns, several large political
donations were turned over directly to Wu in cash, while some donations that
required receipts were given to the Democratic Progressive Party and later
transferred to Chen's campaign headquarters.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors cited Huang as saying that he was not sure about the surplus
campaign funds, and that "only Wu knew how much money was in the fund."</P>
      <P>The reports Chen filed with the Central Election Commission stated that his
campaign expenses in the two presidential elections amounted to NT$900 million
in 2000 and NT$1.2 billion in 2004.</P>
      <P>Chiou also said that Wu was in charge of the use of the funds in the election
campaigns, and Chen "was very likely not aware of how the money was being used."</P>
      <P>Huang Wei-sheng, who was in charge of the spending in Chen's two Taipei mayoral

Chen's son Chen Chih-chung and Huang Jui-ching, have been listed as suspects by
prosecutors in the alleged money-laundering case. Chen Shui-bian, Wu Hsu-jen and
Wu Ching-mao have also been barred from leaving the country.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou promised Sunday that the outlying island of Kinmen, a
former killing field in a battle between Taiwan and China, will be turned into a
peace square, as cross-strait relations have been thawing.</P>
      <P>Ma held out an olive branch to China in his speech delivered at a ceremony held
on Kinmen to mark the 50th anniversary of the 1958 artillery battle between
Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>He reaffirmed his administration's determination to transform Kinmen from a
battlefield into a symbol of peace and to make every effort to prevent a
recurrence of cross-strait war.</P>
      <P>In his speech, titled "From killing field to peace square, " Ma stressed the
need for the two sides of the Taiwan Strait to nurture goodwill and mutual trust
so as to lay the foundation for future negotiations on a cross-strait peace
agreement.</P>
      <P>Ma also announced several governmental policies to help expedite Kinmen's
development and further cement cross-strait relations, via Kinmen.</P>
      <P>To attain that goal, Ma said, his administration is planning to offer landing
visas or multiple visas to Chinese visitors to Kinmen.</P>
      <P>The government will also unveil mid- and long-term development plans which will
integrate Kinmen's tourism, industrial and cultural resources to revamp its
economy, he added.</P>
      <P>"The idea, talked about by many Kinmen residents, of building a bridge between
Kinmen and Xiamen in China's southeastern Fujian province could also been
discussed," Ma said.</P>
      <P>"The issue pertaining to allowing imports of water from Xiamen to resolve
Kinmen's water shortage problems will also be assessed by the government," Ma
told the Kinmen residents.</P>
      <P>Kinmen lies closer to Xiamen than to Taiwan proper.</P>
      <P>Pitching for a deepening of peace across the Taiwan Strait, Ma said that Kinmen
and Xiamen -- literally two "doors" in mandarin -- should be developed in the
future into "doors of reconciliation, " "doors of peace," and "doors of
cooperation."</P>
      <P>The president delivered his speech at Chingtien Hall, a towering hall built
inside a mountain, where the Taiwan military command was deployed during the
1958 Artillery Battle.</P>
      <P>The battle -- more commonly known as the 823 Battle as it began on Aug. 23, 1958
and marked a "turning point in Taiwan's history -- lasted for 44 days during
which communist Chinese artillery troops bombarded the 148 square-kilometer
Kinmen island with 500,000 shells.</P>

      <P>Former President Chen Shui-bian's son and daughter-in-law, who reportedly are
key figures in a case of suspected overseas money laundering involving the
former first family, boarded a flight at New Jersey's Newark Liberty
International Airport Saturday night to return to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen Chih-chung and his wife, Huang Jui-ching, boarded Eva Air Flight BR031 and
are scheduled to arrive in Taiwan around 6 a.m. Monday Taipei time.</P>
      <P>The couple's decision to fly home squashed rumors over the past 15 days that
they had disappeared in the United States amid the money laundering scandal.</P>
      <P>A calm Chen Chih-chung said at the airport to members of several Taiwanese media
outlets that he and his wife are returning to Taiwan to face the judiciary
because they are clean and innocent.</P>
      <P>Chen Chih-chung confirmed that he had registered at the law school of the
University of Virginia Aug. 11, but had not completed the enrollment procedures
nor taken part in orientation.</P>
      <P>"The school authorities told me to 'come back next year' because they had
'received some information,'" he told the reporters.</P>
      <P>For her part, Huang said that only after she arrived in the United States Aug. 9
did she become aware that she had been used as a "figurehead" to open accounts
at two banks in Switzerland for cash deposits.</P>
      <P>According to Jason Yuan, the Republic of China's representative to the United
States, the U.S. assisted Taiwan in locating Chen Chih-chung and his wife, at
the request of the ROC government. The young couple had been technically
"missing" since their entry into the United States Aug. 9, he said.</P>
      <P>A University of Virginia source said Friday that since Taiwan prosecutors have
subpoenaed Chen Chih-chung, he would probably return to face the probe because
his student visa has been revoked and it would be illegal for him to remain in
the United States.</P>
      <P>Former President Chen Shui-bian, his wife Wu Shu-jen and Wu's elder brother were
listed last week as suspects in the case and have been barred from leaving the
country.</P>
      <P>At issue is a report by the Egmont Group -- an international anti-money
laundering organization -- that the Investigation Bureau's Money Laundering
Prevention Center received in January,  which detailed the status of foreign
bank accounts created by members of Chen Shui-bian's family in countries such as
the United States, the Cayman Islands, Singapore and Switzerland.</P>
      <P>Chen's wife claimed last week during questioning by prosecutors that the US$21
million deposited in the family's various overseas bank accounts was "all legal
income." The money is reportedly distributed among three different accounts --
two in Switzerland held in the name of Huang Jui-ching and one in Singapore in
the name of her elder brother Wu Ching-mao.</P>

award" for turning a blind eye to the fact that China's check -- its promise to
improve human rights -- had bounced.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying- jeou was awarded the "finally showing his true colors" prize
for embracing Beijing immediately after being elected although he had promised
during his campaign to boycott the Olympics if the situation in Tibet got worse.</P>
      <P>Chinese dissident Cai Lujun said that he was very disappointed at Ma.</P>
      <P>"Acting obsequiously toward China will not give Taiwan dignity and equality," he
said.</P>
      <P>Wu Yu-hsiang said that by encouraging people to use VISA, the company is saying
it is okay to keep suppressing Chinese workers. Several participants cut their
VISA credit cards into pieces on the spot to express their anger.</P>
      <P>These groups said that what lies behind the grandeur of the Beijing Olympics are
the suppression of Tibet, violation of human rights, and oppression of workers.
Moreover, China's "peaceful rise" is a complete lie, they said.</P>
      <P>"We do not believe China at all because we have been lied to so many times, "
said Tashi Tsering, president of the Regional Tibetan Youth Congress Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"A rising China should not be a totalitarian Communist regime that exports rule
by terror to the world, but rather a country that values democracy, freedom and
human rights, " said Yang Chang-cheng, vice chairman of the Friends of Tibet.</P>
      <P>Huang Mou, director of the Chang Fo-chuan Center for the Study of Human Rights
at Soochow University, said that he disagreed with the view held by many people
that the Beijing Olympics answered many questions the world had about China and
set the future path on which the country will embark.</P>
      <P>If China was really focused on its ancient history, great inventions and the
Confucius idea that "peace is the most valuable thing," as was projected in the
opening ceremony, wouldn't that mean that the communist revolution is over and
there is no need for a one-party dictatorship? he asked.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Peruvian envoy delivers APEC summit invitation to Taiwan</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 24 (CNA)
08/24/08  18:11:07
(By Rachel Chan)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Senior officials confirmed Sunday that an official invitation has been delivered
to Taiwan to participate in an informal summit of economic leaders of the Asia
Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum to be held in Lima, Peru Nov. 22-23 --
a development that could reveal the status of cross-Taiwan Strait relations.</P>
      <P>It was disclosed that APEC Executive-Director Juan Carlos Capunay delivered the
invitation in person to President Ma Ying-jeou before Ma left Taiwan Aug. 12 on
his first state visit to attend the inauguration ceremonies of Paraguayan
President Fernando Lugo and Dominican Republic President Leonel Fernandez.</P>
      <P>"Capunay came to Taiwan in late July and left in early August, " said the
foreign ministry official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, in response to
CNA's inquiries.</P>
      <P>Capunay is the 16th Executive Director of the APEC Secretariat for the 2008 APEC
Year hosted by Peru. He has served as a senior diplomat in the Peruvian Foreign
Service since 1972 in a number of positions around the Asia-Pacific, with
postings in China, Singapore, Japan and the United Nations.</P>
      <P>Based on precedent, the envoy from the host nation will visit Taiwan again
before the informal summit to confirm the delegate designated by the president.</P>
      <P>Under a special arrangement made for Taiwan to participate in APEC, the
country's president has to designate a special envoy to the summit on his
behalf.</P>
      <P>Recent reports claimed that Lien Chan, former vice-president and the honorary
chairman of the ruling Kuomintang (KMT), has been chosen as Taiwan's special
envoy to the APEC summit, but the MOFA denied the report, saying that the
ministry is still in discussions with the Presidential Office on the matter and
no decision has yet been made.</P>
      <P>"It is too early to say who will represent Ma, as the summit is slated for late
November, " the MOFA official said, adding that the candidate will be named
closer to the date of the meeting.</P>
      <P>Since the first APEC informal summit in 1993, Taiwan has been trying to send
officials at the highest posible level to the meeting, but its efforts have been
blocked, in large part, due to objections from China.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has instead sent Nobel laureate Lee Yuan-tseh  and well-known
entrepreneurs, among others, to join the summits.</P>
      <P>This year Taiwan's choice of envoy to the APEC summit will be an indicator of
the status of cross-Taiwan Strait ties, as Taiwan to date has not succeeded in
sending a top-level representative to the meeting.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the choice of delegate will also test China's goodwill regarding Ma's
new diplomatic approach since he took office May 20.</P>
      <P>Ma has proposed a "diplomatic truce" aimed at terminating the longstanding
diplomatic tug-of-war with China in which both countries try to lure each
other's allies to switch diplomatic allegiance by offering large sums of money
in foreign aid to developing countries.</P>
      <P>Ma has also touted the strategy of "modus vivendi" or "pragmatic diplomacy,"
aimed at leveraging more international space for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's latest bid to ask the 63rd United Nations General Assembly to
reconsider on Sept. 16 the feasibility of Taiwan's meaningful participation in
the world body's specialized agencies will serve as the first indicator of the
success of Ma's new strategy.</P>
      <P>APEC has 21 members -- referred to as "Member Economies" -- which account for
approximately 41 percent of the world's population, approximately 55 percent of
world GDP and about 49 percent of world trade.</P>

      <P>Ruling Kuomintang (KMT) Vice Chairman Chiang Pin-kung is scheduled to visit
Japan Aug. 25-27 in another effort to give the assurance that Taiwan does not
favor relations with China over its ties with Japan.</P>
      <P>Chiang, at the head of a six-member KMT delegation, is expected to meet with
Taro Aso, secretary-general of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP),

      <P>Chiang, who doubles as chairman of the intermediary Straits Exchange Foundation,
will represent Ma in clarifying Taiwan's firm stance on maintaining friendly
ties with Japan, according to KMT Legislator Lee Chia-chin, one of the four KMT
lawmakers who will accompany Chiang on the three-day visit to Japan.</P>
      <P>It will be the second delegation from Taiwan to visit Japan within a month.

    <HEADLINE>President thanks U.S. for support during 1958 shelling of Kinmen</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kinmen,   Aug.   24  (CNA)
08/24/08  19:13:13

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou  expressed appreciation Sunday on behalf of the people of
Taiwan to the United States for its assistance in defending the outlying island
of Kinmen during the 1958 bombardment by China.</P>
      <P>The president  made the remarks during a luncheon at the headquarters of the
Kinmen Defense Command. Kinmen, also known as Quemoy, is a small island under
Taiwan's control. It lies closer to China's Fujian Province than to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Ma asked Lloyd V. Evans, chairman of the 823 Badge of Honor Association USA, to
convey the gratitude of the Taiwan people to the U.S. government and people. He
also expressed the hope that Taiwan and the United States will work together to
further cement their friendship.</P>
      <P>Evans and more than 30 representatives from his association were invited to
Kinmen to mark the 50th anniversary  of the 1958 bombardment.</P>
      <P>Also present at the luncheon were Premier Liu Chao-shiuan, Minister of National
Defense Chen Chao-min, former Premier Hau Pei-tsun, veterans who fought in the
battle of the Taiwan Strait, families of officers and solders who perished
during the shelling, journalists who covered the bombardment and Taiwan's
counterattack, and military leaders and soldiers of the Kinmen Defense Command.</P>
      <P>The heavy bombardment began Aug. 23 and lasted 44 days, during which China tried
but failed to pound the small island into submission with 475,000 shells --
about 3,100 for every square kilometer.</P>
      <P>The bombardment resulted in some 3,000 civilian and 1,000 military causalities.
The army on Kinmen countered by firing back 128,000 shells.</P>
      <P>On Sept. 11, 1958, U.S. President Eisenhower strongly reaffirmed his country's
support for the ROC, saying that the bombardment and blockade of Kinmen and
another outlying island Matsu were not so much a genuine attempt to conquer the
Formosa Strait Islands, as part of a plan "to liquidate all of the free world
positions in the Western Pacific."</P>
      <P>The 823 Badge of Honor Association USA was formed in 1998 and has 5,000 members.
Up to 2006, the association each year recommended a list of American candidates
to the Republic of China's Ministry of National Defense for the Honor Medal for
the 1958 Bombardment and the Commemorative Badge for the 1955-1979 US-ROC Mutual
Defense.</P>
      <P>In an open letter to the people of Taiwan Saturday, Evans said, "We of America's
military past are proud to have served Taiwan, but none is as proud as those in
your valiant military. For it is they and the citizens of Kinmen who in 1985
sacrificed, bled and died in order to secure this ephemeral concept called
freedom."</P>
      <P>Evans added, "Taiwan's democratic republic has shown the world that a free
people can transfer political power without bloodshed, that no despot, tyrant,
or any 'ism' can dictate to Taiwan's people how they should live. It is the
citizens of Taiwan that will make that decision as they continue to choose their
path in the world."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said on the outlying island of Kinmen Sunday that
reconciliation between Taiwan and China has already laid a foundation for peace
in the Taiwan Strait, and that he expects to see further broadening of the
cooperation between the two sides, from the existing basis.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a gathering to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the 44-day
bombardment of Kinmen by China from Aug. 23, 1958, Ma said his government will
try to change Kinmen from "the killing field of the 20th century" between the
two sides of the Taiwan Strait to a "peace square" in the 21st century.</P>
      <P>"However, while our minds are focused on working for peace, we cannot believe
ignorantly that this is an earth free from war," he said.</P>
      <P>Ma reiterated that Taiwan must strengthen its defense capability by setting its
defense budget at 3 percent of its gross domestic product in order to prevent
war, not to provoke its neighbors.</P>
      <P>Turning to the 1958 bombardment of Kinmen by China, Ma noted that the bravery of
the defense troops on Kinsmen and the assistance from the United States had made
the island unshakable, and that as a result, the battle served as a turning
point for Taiwan, leading to peace and security for half a century.</P>
      <P>"In war there are no winners, only regret," he said, adding that both sides of
the Taiwan Strait should have learned a lesson and realized that they had paid a
heavy price.</P>
      <P>The president said that to those who fear that the cross-strait relationship is
developing too rapidly, he would like to remind them that the two sides already
wasted 50 years because  of the confrontation and should stop hesitating and
procrastinating any further.</P>
      <P>Ma said all the people of Taiwan should be grateful to those solders and
civilians on Kinmen who died in the battle, because it was their sacrifice that
made it possible for Taiwan to have freedom and prosperity today.</P>
      <P>More than 3,000 civilians and 1,000 garrison troops in Kinmen perished during
the 44-day bombardment during which Chinese artillery fired 475,000 shells --
about 3,100 shells for every square kilometer of the island.</P>

      <P>Two fishermen from Penghu island were rescued and brought to Taichung Port
Sunday after drifting at sea on their powerless boat for seven days.</P>
      <P>Su Yao-shun and his son Su Chia-chang landed at Taichung Port at 4 p.m. aboard a
Taichung Coast Guard Squadron patrol.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile their fishing boat, with its dead engine, was towed to the port by
another Taiwan fishing vessel that had spotted it about 20 nautical miles off
the coast of Hsinchu at 9 a.m.</P>
      <P>The boat alerted a local fishing radio station, which then appealed to the
Taichung Coast Guard Squadron for help.</P>
      <P>The Sus left their home port in Penghu on Aug. 18 to go fishing off the coast of
that island, but their boat engine developed problems and died later that day.</P>
      <P>Their family asked the Penghu Coast Guard Squadron for help after the men failed
to return as expected on Aug. 21.</P>
      <P>The two Sus were in good condition when they arrived at Taichung Port where 14
family members were waiting for them after being notified by the Coast Guard of
their rescue.</P>
      <P>The senior Su said they had encountered nine fishing boats during their seven-
day ordeal at sea and had fired signal flares, but they were ignored until
Sunday morning.</P>
      <P>They said they survived by eating instant noodles and drinking water that melted
from ice blocks they had onboard.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Kinmen welcomes President's promise on visas for Chinese citizens</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 25 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Travel agencies operating on the outlying island of Kinmen expressed welcome
Monday to President Ma Ying-jeou's promise made the day before to offer landing
visas or multiple visas to Chinese visitors to Kinmen.</P>
      <P>"The travel incentives represent a shot in the arm for all the tourism operators
in Kinmen," said Yang Tsai-ping, chief secretary of the Kinmen Association of
Travel Agents.</P>
      <P>President Ma said in his speech delivered in Kinmen Sunday that to accelerate
Kinmen's economic development and facilitate Chinese tourists' traveling to
Kinmen, the administration is planning to offer landing visas or multiple visas
to Chinese visitors to Kinmen.</P>
      <P>Yang said seeking to host more Chinese tourists to Kinmen -- which lies closer
to Xiamen in China's southeastern Fujian Province than to Taiwan proper -- has
been the top goal of Kinmen travel agents since 2004 when residents of Kinmen
and Fujian Province were allowed to begin tourism exchanges via the "mini three
links."</P>
      <P>However, Yang pointed out, only 2,729 Chinese tourist groups, or 58,214 people,
traveled to Kinmen from Fujian over the past four years between Dec. 7, 2004 and
July 31, 2008 -- a figure far lower than originally expected.</P>
      <P>Yang attributed the low number mainly to the fact that paperwork is too much
troublesome and time-consuming for potential Chinese tourists.</P>
      <P>He said Ma's promise Sunday is greatly welcomed, given that if the entry and
exit restrictions involving the "mini three links" are removed, Kinmen would be
in a much better position to attract tourists from Xiamen, which sees the entry
and exit of an average of 20 million people a year.</P>
      <P>He suggested that Taiwan emulate Hong Kong's offering landing visas not only to
groups, but also to individuals, so as to facilitate visits to Kinmen by Chinese
citizens of all walks of life.</P>
      <P>According to Yang, China currently allows only residents from Fujian Province to
visit Kinmen for sightseeing trips, but it has been considering relaxing the
restriction to allow residents from 13 other cities and provinces to visit
Kinmen via the "mini three links" should Taiwan begin offering landing visas to
Chinese visitors.</P>

the development of petrochemical wharves at Anping Harbor in Tainan City,
southern Taiwan, the Kaohsiung Harbor Bureau (KHB) said Monday.</P>
      <P>When the third and fourth wharve development projects are completed, the cargo
throughput capacity of the Chi Mei wharf operations at Anping Harbor will be
increased by 140,000 tons annually to a total of 814,000 tons, a KHB official
said.</P>
      <P>In order to reduce delivery distance, lower potential risk to petrochemical
vehicles and improve the flow of materials, Chi Mei invested NT$500 million
several years ago to construct two 200 meter long, 11 meter deep petrochemical
wharves as well as 16 storage tanks and related facilities.</P>
      <P>Chi Mei's 16 storage tanks, constructed in conjunction with KHB in the first and
second wharve development projects, were completed in October 2007, allowing a
cargo throughput capacity of 674,000 tons annually.</P>
      <P>Six petrochemical storage tanks are expected to be built in the third and fourth
wharve development projects, the KHB official said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Former President Chen Shui-bian's son and daughter-in-law claimed innocence in a
case of suspected money laundering involving the former first family upon their
return to Taiwan from the United States early Monday.</P>
      <P>Chen Chih-chung and his wife, Huang Jui-ching, who have been listed by
prosecutors as suspects in the case, are expected to respond to a summon for
questioning now that they are home.</P>
      <P>Chen Chih-chung told a large crowd of reporters waiting at the Taiwan Taoyuan
International Airport that the family's finances have always been managed by his
mother, Wu Shu-jen, and that he and his wife were only being "dominated" to
offer some help.</P>
      <P>"We just did whatever mother told us to do. It was impossible for us to question
(the origin of the money)," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Huang stressed that she was only a "figurehead" used by her mother-in-law to
open bank accounts overseas for cash deposits and that she and her husband had
never thought of evading judicial investigation by refusing to return to Taiwan,
as some Taiwanese media had speculated.</P>
      <P>"Since our roles in the case are so obvious, we have no need to flee and make
ourselves fugitives," she said.</P>
      <P>Chen Chih-chung, who had gone to the United States together with his wife to
enroll in the law school of the University of Virginia, said he requested that
the enrollment be postponed for one year in the wake of the exposure of the
alleged money-laundering case, but the university turned down his request and
asked him to file an application next year if he still wishes to study at the
school.</P>
      <P>The couple departed Taiwan for the United States just a few days before Next
magazine, a weekly tabloid, ran a story Aug. 13 claiming that Huang had
laundered money for the former first family by secretly wiring NT$300 million
(US$9.55 million) overseas in 2006, after the exposure of the "state affairs
fund" embezzlement case implicating the former president and his wife.</P>
      <P>The story was suspected to have been based on information leaked to the magazine
by Taiwanese investigative authorities,  which received a report in January from
the international anti-money laundering organization Egmont Group that detailed
the status of overseas bank accounts held by members of the former first family
in other countries, including the United States, the Cayman Islands, Singapore
and Switzerland.</P>
      <P>However, allegedly due to concealment by the former head of the Investigation
Bureau, prosecutors investigating the "state affairs fund" case were unaware of
the existence of the report until the publication of the story by Next magazine.</P>
      <P>The release of the story also coincided with the recent reception by Taiwan of a
request by Swiss authorities for assistance in probing alleged money laundering
by Chen Chih-chung and Huang Jui-ching in Switzerland.</P>
      <P>Last Monday, prosecutors listed the former president and his wife, as well as
Wu' s older brother Wu Ching-mao, Chen Chih-chung and Huang Jui-ching, as
suspects in the alleged money-laundering case.</P>
      <P>Questioned by prosecutors Friday, the former first lady said the US$21 million
in overseas bank accounts under the name of her elder brother  and  daughter-in-
law  was  the  balance  of political contributions for the campaigns of her
husband in two mayoral elections and two presidential elections from 1993 to
2004.</P>
      <P>Wu's statement was consistent with that of Chen Shui-bian, who openly confessed
Aug. 14 that he had lied about his election campaign expenses and that his wife
wired surplus funds from the election campaign contributions into overseas bank
accounts.</P>
      <P>However, Chen claimed that all the surplus funds were handled by his wife and
that he had no idea his wife had wired the funds abroad until early this year.</P>
      <P>The former president denied the money had any connection with the "state affairs
fund" case, in which the former first lady was charged with corruption and
forgery in November 2006 for using receipts provided by others to claim
reimbursements totaling NT$14.8 million from the president's "state affairs
fund" between July 2002 and March 2006.</P>
      <P>Chen, who had immunity from prosecution while in office, was named as a co-
offender in the case and was probed as soon as he stepped down from the
presidency May 20.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Only 36.9 percent of the people are satisfied with the performance of President
Ma Ying-jeou over the three months since his inauguration, with as many as 57
percent expressing disapproval, according to the results of a survey released
Monday by the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>The results also showed that the approval rating of Premier Liu Chao-shiuan
stood at only 33.2 percent, with 56.5 percent of respondents displeased with his
performance.</P>
      <P>Chen Chun-lin, director of the DPP's opinion poll center, noted that although
the DPP's support rating has dropped slightly following the exposure of alleged
money laundering implicating former President Chen Shui-bian and his family, the
ruling Kuomintang's approval rating has not increased as a result.</P>
      <P>"This indicates that DPP supporters have not shifted their loyalty to other
parties," Chen Chun-lin said.</P>
      <P>The survey, conducted Aug. 20-22 among 1,348 citizens, had a margin of error of
2.72 percent.</P>
      <P>The results revealed that while the respondents in Keelung, Yilan, Hualien,
Taitung and Penghu were split in their opinions over Ma's performance, over half
of the respondents in other areas were unsatisfied with his performance.</P>
      <P>By age, Ma's disapproval rating registered 62.6 percent among the 30-39 age
group, 62 percent among the 50-59 age group, 42.6 percent among the 20-29 age
group, and 40.7 percent among the 40-49 age group.</P>
      <P>According to Chen Chun-lin, between April 7 and Aug. 22. the DPP carried out a
total of seven surveys on the public's perception of Ma's performance and found
that Ma's approval rating has dropped below 40 percent since late June.</P>
      <P>Over the past two months, Ma's disapproval rating has ranged between 53.5
percent and 57 percent, he said.</P>
      <P>The results of the DPP's latest survey are differebnt from those of a similar
survey conducted Aug. 14-15 and released Aug. 19 by the Cabinet-level Research,
Development and Evaluation Commission, in which Ma received an approval rating
of 47 percent.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the results of another survey conducted Aug. 22 and released Monday
by the China Times showed that Ma's approval rating rose to 46.3 percent from a
low of 35.5 percent recorded one month ago.</P>
      <P>Still, 60 percent of the respondents in the China Times survey were unsatisfied
with the Ma administration's failure to present any effective solutions to boost
the economy and curb inflation.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Chinese spouses' financial solvency requirement to be relaxed</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A requirement that Chinese spouses of local citizens must provide documented
proof of financial solvency when applying for a Taiwanese identity card is to be
significantly relaxed, the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) said Monday.</P>
      <P>MAC spokesman Liu Te-shun said the new relaxed measures, which were drafted by
the Ministry of the Interior (MOI) and have been approved by Interior Minister
Liao Liou-yi, will be put into force as soon as the Executive Yuan gives the go-
ahead.</P>
      <P>Liu quoted an MOI proposal indicating that because some Chinese spouses do not
work outside the home because they have to take care of their husband's elderly
family members or young children, the financial solvency proof of families with
Chinese spouses should be lowered from the current level of NT$34,560
(US$1,100.64) per month, or twice the country's minimum wage, to some NT$19,000,
or 1.1 times the minimum wage.</P>
      <P>The MOI proposed that local families with Chinese spouses should produce
documented proof of movable or personal property worth NT$120,000 -- a figure
much lower than the NT$414,000 -- a staggering 24 times the minimum wage -- that
was put in place over the past four years by the previous Democratic Progressive
Party administration, Liu said.</P>
      <P>The MOI proposed that local families with Chinese spouses should produce
documented proof that they own real estate worth at least NT$800,000, according
to Liu.</P>
      <P>If the Chinese spouse, her Taiwanese husband or other members of their family
have difficulty producing the documented proof, related non-profit organizations
could do it for them, so long as the organizations find that the family is not
under financial strain, Liu said.</P>
      <P>The MOI also proposed the cancellation of a requirement that local families with
Chinese spouses should produce documented proof that the household's savings
deposits in financial institutions exceeding NT$414,000 over the most recent one
year, Liu added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, he noted, the Council of Labor is also planning to relax regulations
governing Chinese spouses' employment in Taiwan and their right to work in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to the MOI, 399,000 foreign spouses were registered in Taiwan as of
the end of 2007 -- 262,000 from China and 137,000 from other countries. The
swingeing restrictions do not apply to spouses from other countries.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) has instructed its offices in Palau, the
Philippines and Indonesia to ask for assistance from the governments of these
countries to help locate a Taiwanese fishing boat that has been missing since
Aug. 19, MOFA spokesman Henry Chen said Monday.</P>
      <P>The Foreign Ministry made the instruction several days ago after being informed
by the Fisheries Agency under the Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture that the
Taiyihsiang, a fishing boat based in Liouciou, Pingtung, went out of touch about
one week after it sailed from Liouciou to fish, Chen said.</P>
      <P>"So far we have received no information from our offices in these three
nations," Chen noted.</P>
      <P>According to a local newspaper report, the Taiyihsiung departed from Liouciou
Aug. 12, with Taiwanese skipper Lee Feng-bao and eight other Indonesian crew
members aboard. The report quoted Lee's family in Pingtung saying that Lee
talked with his family via a radio system everyday, but had not done so since
Aug. 19.</P>
      <P>Neither Lee's family nor fishermen's radio in Pingtung could come into contact
with Lee since Aug. 19, according to the report.</P>
      <P>Analyzing via the satellite Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) , Fisheries Agency
officials deduced that the Taiyihsiang could now be sailing in open seas near
the Philippines, Chen said.</P>
      <P>"The Foreign Ministry will continue to render help to Lee's no matter what
happens," Chen promised.</P>

(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Several Taipei city councilors blasted some of the city's traffic lights Monday,
claiming that they are operated in an "inhuman" way as half of the devices in
the capital city signal red -- a stop signal -- for at least 100 seconds,
forcing people to breathe the exhaust of cars and motorbikes as they idle while
waiting for the lights to change.</P>
      <P>City Councilors Chien Yu-yien, Chen Chien-min and Lee Ching-feng criticized what
they described as the "inefficiency" of the city's traffic signals at a press
conference at the City Council, with Chien pointing out that 1,026 of the 2,184
sets of traffic lights in the city have "a long red light, " while 42 of them
force motorists to wait for at least three minutes during rush hour.</P>
      <P>On the intersection of the Mengjia Boulevard and Siyuan Road, people must wait
for a long time -- long enough for the intersection to remain clear of traffic
for "a while" -- to get a green light, according to Chien.</P>
      <P>One taxi driver, she went on, has complained that the traffic lights on the
Songkao Road behind the City Council remain at red for so long that his fare
meter shows three increases in a single traffic light cycle.</P>
      <P>Citing data she collected, Chien said she found that German people will tolerate
red lights for a maximum of 60 seconds, while she claimed that the maximum red
light in Britain is 45 seconds.</P>
      <P>In comparison, it is "inhuman" for road users in Taipei to have to wait at least
100 seconds before they can cross the road, Chien said.</P>
      <P>Addressing the complaint, city official Lee Kung-chen responsible for traffic
control explained that the traffic signals are installed based on traffic load
and the need for pedestrians to cross the road safely. Their operations are
adjusted to different timings on different intersections, road sections and
districts.</P>
      <P>Rush hours and holidays are also factors that decide how long a signal will
remain red, Lee noted, pointing out that the longer signals are mostly located
on intersections with heavy traffic flow. Any shorter and they would lead to
traffic gridlock, he pointed out.</P>
      <P>Lee went on, however, that the city traffic control department has decided to
conduct an overall check of road traffic in the city in the first half of next
year and that the study results will be used as reference for a possible
adjustment to traffic light operations around the city.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Shuang Ho Hospital, an affiliate of the Taipei Medical University in Taipei
County, announced Monday that it has introduced the labor-delivery-recovery
(LDR) room concept widely adopted in Western countries, with the aim of
providing women with a friendly and more soothing delivery environment.</P>
      <P>According to a hospital spokesman, the LDR room provides pregnant women with a
greater degree of privacy and comfort, allowing them to complete the entire
birthing experience -- labor, delivery and recovery -- in the same room,
accompanied by family members if so desired.</P>
      <P>The spokesman pointed out that this can reduce the mother-to-be's feelings of
nervousness and anxiety.</P>
      <P>He said that normally in Taiwan, women are first taken to a labor room while
they wait for the cervix to fully dilate, after which they are then taken to the
delivery room for the actual birth, which means that the woman can experience a
greater degree of discomfort than is necessary, due to having to be moved from
bed to bed.</P>
      <P>According to the spokesman, LDR rooms follow the modern trend in allowing mother
and baby to be in the same room, adding that this not only provides consumers
with more choices but also reduces medical costs.</P>
      <P>Chou Szu-yuan, a gynecologist at Wanfang Hospital in Taipei, said that most
women would prefer a more soothing childbearing process.</P>
      <P>He said that the introduction of LDR rooms centers on the notion of humanity, as
they not only make women feel respected during the process of childbearing but
also provide family members with an opportunity to participate in the process.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Doctors at the Buddhist Tzu Chi General Hospital in Hualien County, northeastern
Taiwan, reported Monday that they have solved the problem of mood changes
suffered by eight patients after they received deep brain stimulation (DBS)
surgery to treat Parkinson's disease.</P>
      <P>Chen Shih-yuan, convener of the hospital's Parkinson's Clinical and Research
Center, said Tzu Chi has treated 99 Parkinson's disease patients since 2002
using the DBS therapy.</P>
      <P>He said that while most of the patients saw their quality of life improved
because of the surgery, a few showed adverse changes of mood and often quarreled
with their family members.</P>
      <P>Chen said that in order to find out why the mood changes occurred, he and Tsai
Sheng-tzung, chief resident at the hospital's Department of Neurosurgery,
undertook a study in which 38 patients who received DBS surgery were placed
under observation for more than one year. It was established that altogether,
eight of the test subjects were affected by mood changes.</P>
      <P>The two doctors then compared the data on the DBS treatment for the eight
patients with the data on the other patients who did not show any mood changes.</P>
      <P>Their analysis led to the finding that the the electrodes implanted in their
brains were in apparently different areas of the thalamus than those patients
who had no mood change problems.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, all of the eight patients received additional surgery to
adjust the positions of the electrodes in their brains, while medicine was also
used to stabilize their conditions. As a result, the mood change problems were
completely solved.</P>
      <P>DBS has become a standard treatment for patients with Parkinson's disease. In
2006, it was estimated that 30,000 to 40,000 people worldwide with Parkinson's
disease underwent the procedure.</P>
      <P>Tzu Chi Hospital has performed 99 such operations, accounting for 46 percent of
the DBS operations conducted by hospitals in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>DBS therapy requires two surgical procedures -- surgery on the brain to implant
electrodes and another operation in which a neurostimulator is implanted under
the collarbone. When activated, the stimulator sends signals to the brain
through the electrodes to treat the movement disorders that are a symptom of the
disease.</P>
      <P>Previous studies in other countries have reported scattered cases in which
changes in mood or behavior occurred after DBS treatment in people with
Parkinson's disease, but could not establish the cause. A few subsequent studies
raised the theory that some of the electrodes might be off-target and
stimulating the wrong part of the brain.</P>

      <P>Fraud related to Internet shopping has become the major crime of deception in
July and August of this year, accounting for about 70 percent of such crime,
police authorities said Monday.</P>
      <P>Citing statistics compiled by the 165 anti-fraud hot line center run by the
Ministry of the Interior, Criminal Investigation Bureau officers said the center
received 855 inquiry telephone calls last week from the public, with some 70
percent of them, or nearly 600 calls, relating to Internet shopping.</P>
      <P>The number far surpassed the average 20 Internet sex-related criminal cases
reported each week during the same two months, the officers said, noting that
the number of sex-related crime cases in this summer's peak period has not risen
markedly over the numbers of the past several years.</P>
      <P>According to police officers, the growth in alleged fraud cases relating to
Internet shopping might be because these crimes are less time consuming than
sex-related trickery, despite the fact that fraud rings usually use a similar
approach by luring targeted victims into sending money to them through automated
teller machines.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Saturday protest unrelated to former president: DPP</HEADLINE>

      <P>A protest organized by the Taiwan Society Aug. 30 in Taipei is meant to
highlight Taiwan's independent sovereignty and to speak to the government about
the people's strong desire for a better life, an opposition Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) official said Monday.</P>
      <P>The protest to be staged this coming Saturday on Ketagalan Boulevard in front of
the Presidential Office Building has nothing to do with former President Chen
Shui-bian, DPP public relations department director Cheng Wen-tsang said.</P>
      <P>Chen and several family members, including his wife, his son and his daughter-
in-law, have been dogged recently by a money-laundering scandal, which came to
light after a magazine broke the story earlier this month.</P>
      <P>"It is extremely improper to link the Aug. 30 protest, initiated by a civic
group before the scandal was exposed, to Chen's scandal, "he argued, explaining
that the DPP was only playing an auxiliary role in the event.</P>
      <P>According to Cheng, Saturday's activity is aimed at pursuing a guarantee from
the Kuomintang  (KMT)  government  for national sovereignty, a good economy and
several key sunshine bills to build clean politics.</P>
      <P>Commenting on Chen's claim that he donated NT$340 million (US$10.82 million) in
government subsidies to the DPP for some 11.45 million votes he garnered in the
2000 and 2004 presidential elections, he said the party's financial affairs
committee, at the request of DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen, will soon come up with
a clear explanation of how much money Chen contributed to the party over the
past eight years.</P>
      <P>Chen claimed that in line with the DPP's regulations, he had donated one third
of the sum to the party's central committee and the remaining two-thirds to its
local committees.</P>
      <P>On the same day, Koo Kuan-min, honorary chairman of Friends of Taiwan and a
staunch supporter of Taiwan independence, told a news conference that Saturday's
demonstration was designed to protest against the KMT government and push it to
better understand the Taiwan people's deep concern for national sovereignty and
security and for its future, on the 100th day since President Ma Ying-jeou's
inauguration.</P>
      <P>He urged members of the public to cast aside Chen's corruption allegations and
take concrete action to relay their discontent with the KMT government's pro-
China stance.</P>
      <P>According to Koo, the KMT government's edge toward China on both the economic
and political fronts has created grave concern among the Taiwanese people over
the nation's future.</P>
      <P>"But Saturday's activity won't become a gathering to display some people's
backing for Chen, " he asserted, "as the former president was not a factor in
the consideration of the event."</P>
      <P>Friends  of Taiwan is one of the organizations  that is co-sponsoring the Aug.
30 march and protest.</P>
      <P>Demonstrators will march separately from the shopping area on Zhongxiao East
Road in eastern Taipei and from Lungshan Temple in western Taipei before joining
up for a rally on Ketagalan Boulevard Saturday in front of the Presidential
Office Building, where they are slated to stage a string of protests.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the DPP's Kaohsiung City branch said that public response to
Saturday's demonstration in Taipei has been enthusiastic and that more than
2,400 people have registered with it to take part in the activity before the
deadline expires Monday.</P>
      <P>"Each one applying to participate in the demonstration has to pay a NT$600
traffic fee,"  branch head Chen Cheng-wen stressed, adding that over 60 tour
buses carrying the demonstrators will depart for Taipei City Saturday morning.</P>
      <P>Southern regions in Taiwan are traditional strongholds of the pro-Taiwan
independence DPP.</P>

      <P>The Tourism Bureau is to make sure tourist spots around Taiwan have information
and help in Japanese and Korean, as more and more people from these countries
are coming to Taiwan as tourists, the bureau chief said Monday.</P>
      <P>Lai Seh-jen announced the policy while revealing that the number of Japanese
tourists to Taiwan reached 1.16 million in 2007, while tourists from South Korea
numbered over 200,000 people that same year.</P>
      <P>The figures mean that one in three foreign tourists who came to Taiwan last year
was either from Japan or South Korea, Lai said, noting that offering language
services in tourists' native tongues is one of the ways to make foreign guests
feel welcome here.</P>
      <P>Under the idea, the bureau began a measure in February to assist local tourism
operators to improve their language services targeting Japanese and South
Koreans.</P>
      <P>To show businesses how to build foreign language services, representatives of
travel agencies, business associations and the management of hotels and
entertainment parks were invited that day to visit Jiufen, a popular tourist
destination in the northern county of Taipei.</P>
      <P>The attendees were shown how Jiufen -- once a bustling gold mining town -- has
been equipped with Japanese and Korean language services, bureau officials said,
noting that tourists from those countries have accounted for the lion's share of
foreign visitors to Jiufen in recent years.</P>
      <P>According to the bureau, the broadcasting system, warning signs, instructional
signs, tour guides and films are all offered in both languages, and should serve
as a model for other tourist spots.</P>

      <P>A university with a strong background in opto-electronic research will set up a
branch near the Southern Taiwan Science Park in Tainan County to help cultivate
high-tech talent, Tainan County Magistrate Su Huan-chih said Monday.</P>
      <P>National Chiao Tung University, based in Hsinchu City in northern Taiwan, will
create a southern branch located on a 50-hectare property in the southern
county, whose three major industries are optoelectronics, biotechnology, and
semiconductors, Su said.</P>
      <P>The university branch, expected to enroll 1,920 students and house 580 staff
members after the construction project, which will take more than two years,
will solve southern Taiwan's problem of insufficient human resources in high-
technology fields and will also create greater business opportunities for local
tourism, Su said.</P>
      <P>The science park started to house incubation centers for National Chung Cheng
University, based in the southern county of Chiayi, and National Cheng Kung
University, based in Tainan City, in 2002, an effort by the county government to
improve the park's research and development and enhance personnel training, Su
said.</P>
      <P>He went on to say that Academia Sinica, Taiwan's prestigious research institute,
established its Biotechnology Center in Southern Taiwan in the park three years
ago, and in April the county government started to build a research building to
house the institute's 200 researchers.</P>
      <P>Currently, about 70 researchers work at the institute's existing research center
in the park, carrying out experiments in the fields of biomass fuel, orchid
genes, and plant stress resistance.</P>
      <P>The research to be carried out in the new building is expected to help solve
technology problems encountered by the local agricultural industry,  as Tainan

      <P>Although the annual Mid-Autumn Festival is still some 20 days away, Taichung
Mayor Jason Hu called on city residents Monday not to have traditional outdoor
barbecues that day, as part of the city's efforts to reduce carbon dioxide
emissions.</P>
      <P>"Cutting back on emissions of carbon dioxide has been a goal of the Taichung
city government since last year, and the municipal authorities will from now on
take concrete action by asking citizens not to have barbecues in parks or other
public open spaces on the festival," Hu said.</P>
      <P>The mayor said he has asked relevant municipal agencies to start promoting the
campaign. The mid-Autumn Festival falls this year on Sept. 14.</P>
      <P>"Barbecuing is absolutely not good for the health and goes against global eco-
friendly efforts," he said. "The city government will do its best to stop the
public having barbecues in parks, streets or green areas during the Mid-Autumn
Festival."</P>
      <P>Last year, the city government banned barbecues in parks on the holiday, and
only a few public venues were opened to members of the public wishing to have
barbecues, he explained.</P>
      <P>According Hu, just 30 percent of Taiwanese people barbecuing for one hour at the
same time will produce an estimated 6,000 tons of carbon dioxide -- far above a
reduction of 187 tons of greenhouse gas emissions that would be saved should all
Taiwan's residents in the northern, central and southern regions switch off
their lights for 70 minutes at the same time.</P>
      <P>Packaging for traditional moon cake gift boxes should also be trimmed, he added.</P>

      <P>A technology university in southern Taiwan ranked second in Asia and among the
top 10 in the world in a global online marketing competition organized by
Google, the world's largest search engine, the university said in a statement
Monday.</P>
      <P>More than 1,600 student teams from 47 countries took part in the competition,
which was divided into three regions: the Americas; Europe, Africa and the
Middle East and the Asia-Pacific region, according to Google's Web site for the
competition.</P>
      <P>The Department of Information Management of National Kaohsiung University of
Applied Science (KUAS), based in the southern port city of Kaohsiung, had four
teams taking part in the competition, the statement said.</P>
      <P>One of the teams, led by Craig Chao, an assistant professor, won second place in
the Asia-Pacific, while the other three were also among the top 50 in the
region, the statement said.</P>
      <P>The KUAS team was followed by a team from Taiwan's  top university, National
Taiwan University, based in the northern city of Taipei, according to the Web
site.</P>
      <P>KUAS President Fang Chun-hsiung expressed pleasure at the result, saying that
the ranking will raise the visibility of the university in the international
information technology academic field.</P>
      <P>Chao said the competition  gave a "valuable  and hands-on experience" to the
participating students.</P>
      <P>The team chose to work with a 12-year-old local bakery, Chao said, adding that
during the competition period of three weeks, the team attracted 1,262 hits to
the bakery's Web site.</P>
      <P>In addition, 40 large deals totalling more than NT$50,000 (about US$1,590) were
struck, he noted.</P>
      <P>Under  the competition  rules,  the teams received  online advertising spending
via Google AdWords worth US$200. Google displays relevant AdWords ads above and
alongside search results.</P>
      <P>The teams were asked to recruit a small-to-medium-sized business with under 100
employees, which has a Web site but does not use AdWords.</P>
      <P>Each team worked with the business to set up an AdWords account and design an
online marketing campaign during the three-week competition.</P>
      <P>Winners  were chosen based on the effectiveness  of their campaigns.</P>
      <P>According to Chao, the top three teams in Asia will head to Sydney to receive
their awards in October, while the students involved might have the opportunity
to work for Google.</P>
      <P>Two teams from Australia were announced as the global winner and Asia-Pacific

      <P>Export orders received by local businesses in July were valued at US$31.36
billion, representing a year-on-year growth of 5.52 percent -- the lowest on
record since April 2003, when local business was affected by Severe Acute
Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreaks, according to statistics released Monday
by the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA).</P>
      <P>In April 2003 -- when Taiwan was being badly hit by SARS -- the year-on-year
growth of export orders was just 4.32 percent.</P>
      <P>According to the latest tallies, China continued to be Taiwan's largest buyer,
placing US$8 billion-worth of orders with local manufacturers in July.</P>
      <P>However, the year-on-year growth of Chinese export orders dropped to 1.73
percent last month, the lowest since March 2005, while the recession was also
seen in slower growth in orders from the United States and Japan.</P>
      <P>In July, the annual growth rate of U.S. orders recorded only 3.21 percent while
that of orders from Japan registered 1.69 percent, the statistics show.</P>
      <P>MOEA Statistics  Department Director-General  Huang Chi-shih attributed the
marginal growth in Chinese orders to several factors, including China's ability
to now make some of the products for which it formerly relied on imports.</P>
      <P>In the first seven months of this year, Taiwan received US$213.8 billion-worth
of orders from overseas, registering a year-on-year growth of 12.95 percent,

Fisheries Agency officials said Monday.</P>
      <P>The agency has pinpointed the fishing boat on the open sea more than 900
nautical miles off Taiwan, 600 nautical miles off Indonesia and 300 nautical
miles off the Philippines and Palau, the officials said.</P>
      <P>The boat was sailing south, apparently heading for Indonesia, the officials
said, adding that they suspect the Taiwanese captain, Lee Feng-bao, might have
lost command of his boat following a mutiny by his eight Indonesian crewmen.</P>
      <P>The agency has asked Taiwan's  offices in Indonesia,  the Philippines and Palau
to offer assistance through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, as it will take
several days for the coast guard vessel to reach the fishing boat, the officials
went on.</P>
      <P>The relevant authorities in Palau and Indonesia have responded to Taiwan's
requests and are ready to stop the boat, the officials said.</P>
      <P>The boat, named the Taiyihsiang, has not been communicating and has cut off all

      <P>Former President Chen Shui-bian contributed more than NT$390 million (US$12.78
million) to the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) during his eight years in
office, a DPP official said Monday.</P>
      <P>Cheng Wen-tsang, director of the DPP's Department of Culture and Information,
said the party acted on a request from DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen to check on
Chen's contributions over the years.</P>
      <P>Tsai ordered the check after Chen,  mired in a suspected money-laundering case
involving his family members, said last week that he has contributed more than
NT$340 million to the party.</P>
      <P>Cheng noted that most of Chen's contributions came from subsidies for Chen's
presidential elections in 2000 and 2004. Calculated at NT$30 per ballot he
received, Chen contributed NT$340 million.</P>
      <P>The party stipulates that one-third of the subsidies must be turned over to DPP
headquarters, with the remaining two-thirds going to local DPP chapters to help
finance local elections.</P>
      <P>In addition, and in line with the DPP's practice that requires every DPP
official to solicit a certain amount of money in proportion to their party or
government rank, Chen solicited NT$58 million for the party over the past eight
years.</P>
      <P>The former president also helped solicit donations in every election and party
activity by targeting enterprises or individuals, Cheng went on, adding that
these funds were reported to the authorities as required by law.</P>
      <P>"The publication of this financial information related to Chen is mainly to tell
the public that the party's financial and accounting system is open, transparent

      <P>The Cabinet-level Educational Funding Committee has decided that next year's
national education budget will amount to NT$469.4 billion (US$15 billion) , up
NT$21.4 billion from this year's figure, a Ministry of Education (MOE) official
said Monday.</P>
      <P>The committee, which is responsible for computing the national education budget,
is chaired by Education Minister Cheng Jei-cheng.</P>
      <P>According to Ke Jeng-feng, executive secretary of the MOE's Department of
Educational Research, the budget plan will be submitted to the Executive Yuan
for review before being sent to the Legislative Yuan for approval.</P>
      <P>Most of the increased amount goes to subsidies for disadvantaged students --
accounting for NT$20.8 billion -- Ke said, adding that the figure represents an
increase of NT$4 billion from this year's level.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  NT$17.4  billion  will be used for fundamental education, NT$8.7
billion for advanced education and NT$60.1 billion will be used as subsidies to
local governments to help cover general expenditures such as school lunches,
along with water and electricity fees, said Ke.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that NT$7.5 billion that should have been part of this year's
education budget but was appropriated for a government's program to boost
domestic demand, will be distributed next year, plus an additional NT$1.2
billion.</P>
      <P>Cheng said next year's education budget will have an overall increase of NT$24.2
billion if funds raised by individual schools themselves are included.</P>
      <P>According to Su Te-hsiang,  director-general  of the MOE's Department of
Secondary Education, the MOE plans to set stricter graduation standards for
senior high school students by amending the regulations, which stipulate that a
senior high student has to get at least 48 credits to get a high school diploma.</P>
      <P>The new regulations will set the minimum requirement at 60 credits, said Su,

      <P>Former President Chen Shui-bian's son and daughter-in-law  have been barred from

      <P>Chu Chao-liang, the spokesman for the team investigating the suspected money
laundering case, said the prosecution took into consideration the couple's
health state before summoning them for questioning just 10 hours after their
flight arrived.</P>
      <P>"Neither of the couple asked for a break in the interrogations for fatigue
during the nearly-three-hour session," said Chu.</P>
      <P>While the couple were still in the United States, the prosecution served
subpoenas demanding them to come forward for questioning Aug. 29.</P>
      <P>"As they came back earlier than expected, we decided to summon them for
questioning today, " said Lin Chi-hui, another prosecutor involved in the
investigation.</P>
      <P>Asked why the prosecution did not arrest them at the airport immediately upon
their return, Lin said that because the case happened more than six months ago,
they would have had ample opportunity had they decided to collude in perjuring
themselves and that there was therefore little point in detaining and separating
them.</P>
      <P>During the questioning, according to media reports, the couple refused to sign
authorization letters allowing the prosecution to scrutinize their Swiss bank
accounts.</P>
      <P>The refusal could slow progress in investigating the case, but legal experts
said that the prosecution will still be able to get the documents  they need
through  judicial  assistance  from Swiss authorities.</P>
      <P>Chen Chih-chung told a large crowd of reporters waiting at the Taiwan Taoyuan
International Airport early Monday that the family's finances have always been
managed by his mother, Wu Shu-jen, and that he and his wife were only being
"dominated" to offer some help.</P>
      <P>"We just did whatever mother told us to do. It was impossible for us to question
(the origin of the money)," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Huang stressed that she was only a "figurehead" used by her mother-in-law to
open bank accounts overseas for cash deposits and that she and her husband had
never thought of evading judicial investigation by refusing to return to Taiwan,
as some Taiwanese media had speculated.</P>
      <P>"Since our roles in the case are so obvious, we have no need to flee and make
ourselves fugitives," she said.</P>
      <P>Chen Chih-chung, who had gone to the United States together with his wife to
enroll in the law school of the University of Virginia, said he requested that
the enrollment be postponed for one year in the wake of the exposure of the
alleged money-laundering case, but the university turned down his request and
asked him to file an application next year if he still wishes to study at the
school.</P>
      <P>The couple departed Taiwan for the United States just a few days before Next
magazine, a weekly tabloid, ran a story Aug. 13 claiming that Huang had
laundered money for the former first family by secretly wiring NT$300 million
(US$9.55 million) overseas in 2006, after the exposure of the "state affairs
fund" embezzlement case implicating the former president and his wife.</P>
      <P>The story was suspected to have been based on information leaked to the magazine
by Taiwanese investigative authorities,  which received a report in January from
the international anti-money laundering organization Egmont Group that detailed
the status of overseas bank accounts held by members of the former first family
in other countries, including the United States, the Cayman Islands, Singapore
and Switzerland.</P>
      <P>However, allegedly due to concealment by the former head of the Investigation
Bureau, prosecutors investigating the "state affairs fund" case were unaware of
the existence of the report until the publication of the story by Next magazine.</P>
      <P>The release of the story also coincided with the recent reception by Taiwan of a
request by Swiss authorities for assistance in probing alleged money laundering
by Chen Chih-chung and Huang Jui-ching in Switzerland.</P>
      <P>Last Monday, prosecutors listed the former president and his wife, as well as
Wu' s older brother Wu Ching-mao, Chen Chih-chung and Huang Jui-ching, as
suspects in the alleged money-laundering case.</P>
      <P>Questioned by prosecutors last Friday, the former first lady said the US$21
million in overseas bank accounts under the name of her elder brother and
daughter-in-law was the balance of political contributions for the campaigns of
her husband in two mayoral elections and two presidential elections from 1993 to
2004.</P>
      <P>Wu's statement was consistent with that of former President Chen Shui-bian, who
openly confessed Aug. 14 that he had lied about his election campaign expenses
and that his wife wired surplus funds from the election campaign contributions
into overseas bank accounts.</P>
      <P>However, Chen claimed that all the surplus funds were handled by his wife and
that he had no idea his wife had wired the funds abroad until early this year.</P>
      <P>The former president denied the money had any connection with the "state affairs
fund" case, in which the former first lady was charged with corruption and
forgery in November 2006 for using receipts provided by others to claim
reimbursements totaling NT$14.8 million from the president's "state affairs
fund" between July 2002 and March 2006.</P>
      <P>Chen, who had immunity from prosecution while in office, was named as a co-
offender in the case and was probed as soon as he stepped down from the
presidency May 20.</P>

      <P>Export orders received by local businesses in July were valued at US$31.36
billion, representing a year-on-year growth of 5.52 percent -- the lowest on
record since April 2003, when local business was affected by Severe Acute
Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreaks, according to statistics released Monday
by the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA).</P>
      <P>In April 2003 -- when Taiwan was being badly hit by SARS -- the year-on-year
growth of export orders was just 4.32 percent.</P>
      <P>According to the latest tallies, China continued to be Taiwan's largest buyer,
placing US$8 billion-worth of orders with local manufacturers in July.</P>
      <P>However, the year-on-year growth of Chinese export orders dropped to 1.73
percent last month, the lowest since March 2005, while the recession was also
seen in slower growth in orders from the United States and Japan.</P>
      <P>In July, the annual growth rate of U.S. orders recorded only 3.21 percent while
that of orders from Japan registered 1.69 percent, the statistics show.</P>
      <P>MOEA Statistics  Department Director-General  Huang Chi-shih attributed the
marginal growth in Chinese orders to several factors, including China's ability
to now make some of the products for which it formerly relied on imports.</P>
      <P>In the first seven months of this year, Taiwan received US$213.8 billion-worth
of orders from overseas, registering a year-on-year growth of 12.95 percent,

    <HEADLINE>Ex-president contributed NT$390 m. to DPP over two terms: party</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Former President Chen Shui-bian contributed more than NT$390 million (US$12.78
million) to the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) during his eight years in
office, a DPP official said Monday.</P>
      <P>Cheng Wen-tsang, director of the DPP's Department of Culture and Information,
said the party acted on a request from DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen to check on
Chen's contributions over the years.</P>
      <P>Tsai ordered the check after Chen,  mired in a suspected money-laundering case
involving his family members, said last week that he has contributed more than
NT$340 million to the party.</P>
      <P>Cheng noted that most of Chen's contributions came from subsidies for Chen's
presidential elections in 2000 and 2004. Calculated at NT$30 per ballot he
received, Chen contributed NT$340 million.</P>
      <P>The party stipulates that one-third of the subsidies must be turned over to DPP
headquarters, with the remaining two-thirds going to local DPP chapters to help
finance local elections.</P>
      <P>In addition, and in line with the DPP's practice that requires every DPP
official to solicit a certain amount of money in proportion to their party or
government rank, Chen solicited NT$58 million for the party over the past eight
years.</P>
      <P>The former president also helped solicit donations in every election and party
activity by targeting enterprises or individuals, Cheng went on, adding that
these funds were reported to the authorities as required by law.</P>
      <P>"The publication of this financial information related to Chen is mainly to tell
the public that the party's financial and accounting system is open, transparent
and can withstand any scrutiny, " Cheng added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>2009 education budget to increase by NT$21.4 billion</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Educational Funding Committee has decided that next year's
national education budget will amount to NT$469.4 billion (US$15 billion) , up
NT$21.4 billion from this year's figure, a Ministry of Education (MOE) official
said Monday.</P>
      <P>The committee, which is responsible for computing the national education budget,
is chaired by Education Minister Cheng Jei-cheng.</P>
      <P>According to Ke Jeng-feng, executive secretary of the MOE's Department of
Educational Research, the budget plan will be submitted to the Executive Yuan
for review before being sent to the Legislative Yuan for approval.</P>
      <P>Most of the increased amount goes to subsidies for disadvantaged students --
accounting for NT$20.8 billion -- Ke said, adding that the figure represents an
increase of NT$4 billion from this year's level.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  NT$17.4  billion  will be used for fundamental education, NT$8.7
billion for advanced education and NT$60.1 billion will be used as subsidies to
local governments to help cover general expenditures such as school lunches,
along with water and electricity fees, said Ke.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that NT$7.5 billion that should have been part of this year's
education budget but was appropriated for a government's program to boost
domestic demand, will be distributed next year, plus an additional NT$1.2
billion.</P>
      <P>Cheng said next year's education budget will have an overall increase of NT$24.2
billion if funds raised by individual schools themselves are included.</P>
      <P>According to Su Te-hsiang,  director-general  of the MOE's Department of
Secondary Education, the MOE plans to set stricter graduation standards for
senior high school students by amending the regulations, which stipulate that a
senior high student has to get at least 48 credits to get a high school diploma.</P>
      <P>The new regulations will set the minimum requirement at 60 credits, said Su,
adding that the MOE will come up with complementary measures at the end of
August and will have settled the plan by the end of October after several public
hearings.</P>
      <P>The implementation of the new regulations is expected to take effect next August
at the earliest time, he added.</P>

      <P>Former President Chen Shui-bian's son and daughter-in-law  have been barred from
leaving  Taiwan pending investigations into their roles in a suspected money
laundering case embroiling the former first family, prosecutors said Monday.</P>
      <P>The overseas travel ban was issued after the young couple were questioned as
suspects in the high-profile money scandal for nearly three hours that
afternoon.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors from the Special Investigation Division under the Supreme
Prosecutors Office issued subpoenas to the couple -- Chen Chih-chung and his

      <P>Sixty-four percent of college graduates who left school this summer have not
found jobs in the three months since, according to the results of a survey
released Tuesday by an online employment broker.</P>
      <P>The survey conducted by 104 Job Bank found that of the 36 percent of graduates
who have been  employed,  more than half began distributing their resumes before
April, again proving true the belief that those who apply early have a better
chance of landing jobs.</P>
      <P>The starting salaries for this group of graduates averaged NT$41,250 for
doctorate degree holders, NT$33,254 for master's degree holders, NT$23,088 for
bachelor's degree holders, and NT$21,887 for polytechnic graduates, the results
showed.</P>
      <P>Among the fresh graduates who are still in search of employment, 16 percent said
they had been offered employment but decided not to accept for reasons such as
discrepancies between the job content and what they imagined,  differences
between job content and job description, low possibility of growth, and lower
than expected pay offers.</P>
      <P>While 7 percent of fresh graduates have not found a job because they have not
started distributing their resumes, 19.2 percent have sent out 1-5 copies of
resumes, 17.6 percent have sent 6-10 copies, and 17.3 percent have sent more

      <P>The National Kinmen Institute of Technology is to forge sisterhood ties with the
Far Eastern State Technical University located in Vladivostok, Russia, the
president of the Kinmen school said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Lee Chin-chen made the announcement during a symposium on the Russian language
held at the institute on the Taiwan-held outlying island of Kinmen.</P>
      <P>During the seminar, participants exchanged views and shared their experiences on
teaching the Russian language, while six Taiwanese and Russian scholars
presented their theses on related subjects.</P>
      <P>The seminar is the first on the subject of the Russian language held at the
school since it launched a plan to increase exchanges and cooperation with
foreign education institutes.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the seminar, Lee said that as Kinmen had been on the frontline in
the battle against communists regimes, including the Soviet Union, for over 60
years, the island had no contact with the Russian language.</P>
      <P>However, under the current situation, with Kinmen's warming ties with China and
the establishment of the "mini three links, " the island has been working to
increase its ties with Russia, which shares a 4,000-kilometer border with China,
Lee explained.</P>
      <P>He said he will travel to the Far Eastern State Technical University on Sept. 23
to conclude the sisterhood arrangement.</P>
      <P>Lee said that the exchanges with the Vladivostok-based school under the
sisterhood agreement would mean that the Kinmen technical institute's  practical
foreign language curriculum will not be restricted to English.</P>
      <P>"Establishing a Russian language learning environment at the school will open up
another door of knowledge for Kinmen students, " he added.</P>
      <P>Participants in the one-day symposium included professors Natalia S. Milyanchuk
and Julia A. Gunko from the Far Eastern State Technical Institute,  as well as
Lee Hsi-mei,  head of Chinese Culture University's Russian language department,

    <HEADLINE>CLA postpones decision on minimum wage increase</HEADLINE>

08/26/08  15:03:35
(By Emmanuelle Tzeng)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) decided Tuesday to delay its decision for
month on whether to increase the country's minimum wage, based on the
recommendations of a special committee assigned to examine the issue.</P>
      <P>Government representatives on the committee argued that a minimum wage increase
at this time of economic stagnation could push businesses to close down, said
Mike Jen, president of the National Trade Union Confederation  and a labor
representative  on the committee.</P>
      <P>Committee members representing employers said they understood the workers'
situation but agreed that the decision on a minimum wage increase should be
postponed, according to Jen.</P>
      <P>However, Jen argued that it is precisely because of the current economic
slowdown that the government should move to help low-income workers.</P>
      <P>The CLA said that a decision can be expected in month's time, after the Chung-
Hua Institution for Economic Research presents a report on the impact of last
year's minimum wage increase.</P>
      <P>The  22-member  committee  was  composed  of scholars  and representatives from
labor, the private sector and government.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's minimum wage was raised last year from NT$15,840 (US$502) to NT$17,280
(US$548) per month. But the labor unions argued that the increase was not
sufficient to cover the daily basic needs of workers.</P>
      <P>On the day when the committee meet, representatives of labor unions demonstrated
outside the CLA building, asserting the right of workers to live with dignity
and demanding that the minimum wage be raised at least 38 percent to NT$23,870.</P>
      <P>We want to earn our livelihood with our own strength. How can we live with
dignity if our salary cannot even allow us a minimum subsistence? " Wang Chuan-
ping, Chief Executive Officer of the Labor Rights Association, said to the CNA.</P>
      <P>Her association said that the minimum wage should allow a worker's family to at
least meet its living expenses. As the prices of raw materials and energy
continue to rise, the growth rate of the minimum wage should not be lower than
that of the consumer price index (CPI), she said.</P>
      <P>According to Chen Pao-chan, executive director of the Chinese Federation of
Labor, about 1.43 million of the 8.8 million workers in Taiwan receive a monthly
salary below the current minimum wage.</P>
      <P>However, business representatives on the committee insisted that a minimum wage
increase would only be beneficial to foreign workers, and that it would not
necessarily be advantageous to Taiwanese workers.</P>
      <P>"Most Taiwanese workers already earn more than the minimum wage, therefore,
(increasing the minimum wage) would not make much of a difference to them, and
it would not do any good for the country's economic development, " said K. P.
Chang, one of the business representatives, adding that personally he expected
the hike to be limited to less than 10 percent.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Japan, Taiwan should shelve sovereignty issue in fishery talks: FM</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Foreign Minister Francisco H.L. Ou said Tuesday that Taiwan and Japan should set
aside the sovereignty dispute over the Tiaoyutai Islands and work out a
mechanism to jointly manage and develop the controversial territory, adding that
the long-stalled fishery talks with Japan will resume next month.</P>
      <P>"Given the fact that neither Taiwan nor Japan is likely to make any concession
on the sovereignty (of the Tiaoyutai Islands) , we should try to see if the
model of shelving sovereignty disputes with China can be applied to the fishery
talks with Japan, " said Ou in an interview with the CNA.</P>
      <P>"This is not entirely impossible, if we can think along the lines of setting up
a committee for joint management and development of the disputed waters, while
setting aside the sovereignty issue, "he added.</P>
      <P>A Taiwanese recreation fishing boat sank after colliding with a Japanese patrol
vessel June 10. The collision, which occurred near the disputed Tiaoyutai
Islands, sparked renewed controversy over the sovereignty of the island group,
known as the Senkaku Islands in Japanese.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan, Japan and China all claim rights to the Tiaoyutai Islands, this has
complicated fishing disputes between Taiwan and Japan.</P>
      <P>The two sides held a 15th round of fishery talks in July 2005 to try to resolve
the disputes and both sides agreed to hold another round of dialogue in March
2006, but the talks never took place.</P>
      <P>"If the fishery rights issue cannot be resolved, there's no telling if we have
another incident like this whether it will interfere with our relations with
Japan," Ou said.</P>
      <P>He proposed that both Taiwan and Japan pay an "access fee" when fishing boats of
either country enter the disputed waters -- a method used by Japan in dealing
with its disputes with Russia over "four northern islands."</P>
      <P>Now that both Taiwan and Japan have agreed to resume the fishery talks, Ou said,
he hopes that the next round of negotiations will start in the next month.</P>
      <P>He however admitted that Taiwan has not yet discussed its new proposal with
Japan and does not know how Japan would respond.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Pursuit of diplomatic truce to create win-win-win situation: VP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  26 (CNA)
08/26/08  16:24:41

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying- jeou's pursuit of a "diplomatic truce" with China will not
only lead to lasting peace in the Taiwan Strait and global stability, but will
also help to attract more investment to Taiwan and strengthen the country's move
toward globalization, Vice President Vincent Siew said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Siew made the comments in a speech at the opening of a two-day Taiwan-U.S. forum
on modern China, at National Chengchi University's Institute of International
Relations.</P>
      <P>This year's forum, which is the 37th of its kind, will focus on the themes of "a
new order, new identity, and democratic transition."</P>
      <P>According to Siew, the closed-door policy pursued by the previous Democratic
Progressive Party administration over the last eight years not only hurt
Taiwan's economic development, but also negatively affected regional economic
development.</P>
      <P>This insular  policy also resulted  in the loss of major opportunities  for
Taiwan  in terms of strengthening  economic cooperation with other countries, he
added.</P>
      <P>Siew said all the data on cross-strait economic exchanges clearly shows that
Taiwan's closer economic integration with China since Ma's administration took
office in May has created a winning situation for both sides, adding that Taiwan
must grab the opportunities presented by closer ties with China.</P>
      <P>As for those who are concerned about the potential threat that China poses, Siew
said that the new government has been actively working to turn this threat into
opportunity and to realize the goal of creating peace in the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The only way to achieve this goal is through liberalizing and normalizing
economic relations across the strait, he stressed.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that the government was able to reach agreements with China on
implementing regular cross-strait weekend charter flights and opening Taiwan to
more Chinese tourists, Siew said the government is also actively pushing several
mid- and long-term cross-strait  policies  that  are  aimed  at liberalizing
and internationalizing  Taiwan's  economy in order to attract more investment to
the country and link it closer with the global market.</P>
      <P>In addition to developing economic ties, President Ma has also actively
advocated a cross-strait diplomatic truce of setting aside controversial
issues,  building mutual trust,  and ending the longstanding tug-of-war in which
each side tries to poach the other's diplomatic allies by offering large sums of
money in foreign aid.</P>
      <P>Siew said the president's "more practical and flexible" foreign policy is aimed
at rebuilding Taiwan's international reputation and turning the country into a
responsible stakeholder, and not a troublemaker, in the global community.</P>
      <P>The vice president stressed that the diplomatic truce policy does not disregard
Taiwan's international space, arguing that Taiwan will continue to maintain good
relations and exchanges  with other countries, especially the United States and
Japan.</P>
      <P>The government's new foreign policy, Siew said, will help create a "win-win-win
situation" for Taiwan, China and the global community by establishing peace in
the Taiwan Strait and contributing to international stability.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou pledged Tuesday that his administration will inject more
funds into the sports sector by redistributing the government's financial
resources.</P>
      <P>According to Ma, an excessively large proportion of the country's educational
resources is being placed in mental training while very little is being invested
in physical training.</P>
      <P>He urged the Ministry of Education and the Sports Affairs Council to work to
improve physical education and sports development in the country and to pay more
attention to sports competitions and the training of top athletes.</P>
      <P>The president made the remarks while receiving members of Taiwan's national team
on their return from the just-concluded 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing. Taiwan
won four bronze medals and was ranked 72nd among the 204 countries and regions
that participated in the event.</P>
      <P>Ma recalled that during his terms as Taipei mayor from 1998 to 2006, the city
government's investment in the sports sector was second only to its budget for
the construction of the city's metro system.</P>
      <P>Over the eight-year period, the city built or renewed a total of 80 swimming
pools, and more than 85 percent of elementary school students and 75 percent of
secondary school students passed swimming tests, Ma noted.</P>
      <P>Ma said the efforts made by the city government may not be widely known to
everyone, but he was trying to send the message -- anyone studying in Taipei
must be able to swim.</P>
      <P>"I was trying to define what constitutes a 'sound citizen, ' and having basic
physical abilities is part of that," he said.</P>
      <P>Ma said he is sure that it is worthwhile for the government to invest more in
promoting sports in light of the potential benefits to the health of the
country's citizens.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A ban on fertilizer exports will remain in place to help meet local demand amid
rising fertilizer prices on the world market, the Cabinet-level Council of
Agriculture (COA) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>"Fertilizer prices on the domestic market will not be increased until the end of
this year, but the ban on fertilizer exports will be kept in place to avoid
exports of cheap Taiwanese fertilizer at a time when global fertilizer prices
are still rising," the COA said in a press release.</P>
      <P>Thanks to government subsidies, Taiwan's urea is priced at NT$11,250 (US$358)
per ton, which is only 30 percent of Japan's price, 50 percent of South Korea's
price and 70 percent of China's price, it noted.</P>
      <P>The COA predicted that international fertilizer prices will be unlikely to drop
in the near term due to increased demand from developing countries, including
China and India.</P>
      <P>The COA's Agriculture and Food Agency also said the government will do its best
to stabilize domestic fertilizer prices by the end of this year and to fully
satisfy local farmers' needs through well designed distribution channels.</P>
      <P>COA Minister Chen Wu-hsiung announced May 28 that state-run Taiwan Fertilizer
would absorb some 70 percent of the hikes in fertilizer prices that would take
effect May 30.</P>
      <P>But after heavy protests by farmers who complained that the price increases
would drive them off their farms, Chen announced two days later that the
fertilizer company would absorb up to 85 percent of the overall price increase
and that there would be no fresh price adjustments before the end of this year.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The price of milk powder, which has been constantly rising since last year, is
not expected to increase further in the coming months because production prices
have dropped from their peak in February, according to a Ministry of Economic
Affairs (MOEA) report released Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Government Information Office Deputy Minister Lin Ching-hsiu revealed the report
after a meeting of the Executive Yuan's special team devoted to seeking and
achieving stable domestic commodity prices.</P>
      <P>Vice Premier Chiu Cheng-hsiung presided over the meeting.</P>
      <P>Lin told reporters that New Zealand has been Taiwan's main source of milk
powder, followed by China and the Netherlands. The wholesale price of milk
powder imported from New Zealand and the international fresh milk price both
have been sliding over past two months, he added.</P>
      <P>Citing the MOEA report, Lin said the international fresh milk price began
dropping after it climbed to a peak of US$21.40 per pound on July 21, 2007. The
price dropped even further from US$20.50 per pound Jan. 2 this year to US$17.15
per pound Aug. 20, a drop of 16.34 percent.</P>
      <P>Lin further said that the price of milk powder imported from New Zealand has
declined over the past two months to the February 2007 level, and that between
Aug. 1-20, the price of domestic fresh milk decreased 1.2 percent from the July
level but the price of milk powder recorded a slight increase of 0.5 percent.</P>
      <P>Lin  noted  that  the moderate  fluctuations  reflect  the stabilization of
prices of essential products. There should be no factors to cause the price of
milk powder to go up in the coming months, he added.</P>
      <P>Significant growth in milk prices began in late 2006, due to skyrocketing
international crude oil and raw material prices.</P>

sides of the Taiwan Strait can conduct dialogue on the issue.</P>
      <P>Under President Ma Ying-jeou's  concept of "modus vivendi" diplomatic strategy
and a "diplomatic truce" with China, Taiwan made a fundamental shift in its U.N.

"meaningful participation" in U.N. specialized agencies instead of seeking full
membership in the world body as it has done unsuccessfully in previous years.</P>
      <P>In an interview with CNA, Ou said that the more moderate and pragmatic approach
has received a very good response from the international community and that he
believes the bid will win more support during the Sept. 16 U.N. General
Assembly.</P>
      <P>However the fate of Taiwan's new initiative hinges on China's attitude. Ou said
that even though he cannot predict whether China will let the bid be included on
the U.N. agenda given the fact that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait have not
yet negotiated the issue, he still hopes Beijing will give it a green light.</P>
      <P>"Although the two sides have not discussed the issue, I think there is the need
to negotiate with China on the matter, " Ou said.</P>
      <P>"I hope that the issue of Taiwan's international space can be included in cross-
strait talks as soon as possible, " he added, saying that economic negotiations
between Taipei and Beijing, for example, under the framework of the World Trade
Organization, will inevitably tap the issue of Taiwan's international space.</P>
      <P>Talks between Taiwan and China re-opened June 11 for the first time in 10 years,
involving Taiwan's quasi-official Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) and its
Chinese counterpart, the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait
(ARATS) . The two sides agreed to focus on economic and trade issues in the
beginning, setting aside political issues such as sovereignty and Taiwan's
international space.</P>
      <P>The fresh  approach  by the government  for the country's participation to the
U.N. is seen as the first crucial test for Ma's diplomacy, which has been
criticized by the opposition as giving up Taiwan's sovereignty.</P>
      <P>Since 1993, Taiwan's allies have been trying to put the issue of Taiwan's
participation on the agenda of the U.N. General Assembly, but Beijing's argument
that Taiwan is part of China has prevailed.</P>
      <P>Noting that the Foreign Ministry has done a lot of work in pitching this year's
bid to its allies and other important countries such as the United States, the
European Union and Japan, Ou said that the more pragmatic approach is in line
with the government's policy of seeking reconciliation and a "diplomatic truce"
with China.</P>
      <P>The frosty relations between Taiwan and China have been thawing since Ma took
office May 20, with his proposal of a "diplomatic truce" aimed at terminating
the longstanding diplomatic tug-of-war with China in which both countries try to
lure each other's allies to switch diplomatic allegiance by offering large sums
of money in foreign aid to developing countries.</P>
      <P>Ou also said positive results have been observed in terms of multilateral
relations, as well as cross-strait relations, citing as an example Ma's recent
first state visit to South America and the Caribbean.</P>
      <P>He said changes in the attitudes of Taiwan's allies Paraguay, Panama and the
Dominican Republic can serve as an indicator that China has shown goodwill
toward Ma's diplomatic strategy.</P>
      <P>"We have made sufficient manifestation to the international community and the
response has been very good, " the Foreign Minister said. "They all think the
bid is very reasonable."</P>
      <P>Ou admitted that it is a daunting task to get the bid listed on the U.N. agenda,
but said the most important thing is that the international community has a
positive response to Taiwan's approach.</P>
      <P>"The case is impossible without international support, " he noted. "Even if the
case fails to be listed on the agenda, I believe many countries will speak for
us at the General Assembly or will express their support in other less direct
ways," he said.</P>

      <P>Public and private investment in urban renewal projects will amount to an
estimated NT$80 billion (US$8.9 billion) over the next four years, the Ministry
of the Interior (MOI) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>According to the ministry, 50 potential urban rejuvenation projects on mostly
government-owned land might be launched over the coming four years. If the
government can succeed in soliciting enough investment in 20 of these projects,
the total investment will reach NT$124.9 billion.</P>
      <P>During the same period, the government is also scheduled to approve 100 private
urban renewal projects, for a total investment NT$150 billion, with each case
receiving an average investment of NT$1.5 billion.</P>
      <P>With all these projects combined, an MOI official said, private and government
investments in urban rejuvenation could top NT$280 billion in the coming four
years.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that the urban renewal programs are part of the "i-Taiwan 12
projects" proposed by President Ma Ying-jeou in his campaign platform, the
official said they will be referred to the Executive Yuan for review and
implementation step by step.</P>
      <P>To quicken the pace of the urban renewal, the official went on, the ministry has
stepped up preparations for bidding procedures, with 12 areas now in the pre-
processing stage of calling for tenders.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the official said the Executive Yuan authorized Aug. 14 the
establishment of a Central Urban Renewal Fund using NT$40 million of the 2009
budget to attract private investment in the redevelopment of government-owned
urban land plots.</P>
      <P>A unit has also been entrusted to establish an office to assist in encouraging
and integrating interest in urban renewal and calling for tenders, added the
official.</P>

      <P>The Sports Affairs Council (SAC) will submit a review on the national
delegation's performance in the Beijing Olympics to the Executive Yuan for its
reference when reviewing the current athletic training system in pursuit of a
better one, a SAC official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The delegation of 80 players participated in 15 events and brought home four
bronze medals, two in taekwando and two in weightlifting.</P>
      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan met with delegation members that same day to give his
regards for their performance, which allowed Taiwan to rank 80th among 204
countries and areas. The medal count was the country's worst since 1988.</P>
      <P>The official said the SAC will submit the report to the Cabinet Aug. 28, and
will expect improvements to the whole training system to be made by the Cabinet.</P>
      <P>The official pointed out that many players only received training in Taiwan and
do not have enough experience participating in international sports events.</P>
      <P>This weakness has caused players who are unmatched in Taiwan to win no medals in
international events, the official said, adding that the report will suggest
hiring more coaches who meet international standards to contribute to future
training.</P>
      <P>The report will also suggest beginning athletic training earlier, when potential
athletes are in elementary school, the official said. He emphasized that this
change is a must because it takes at least six to 10 years of training to help
an athlete achieve peak performance.</P>
      <P>Also according to the official, the SAC has communicated with the Ministry of
Education about assisting potential players in choosing majors and schools that
will be most beneficial to their future performance in international games.</P>
      <P>The future training should be aimed at long-term performance in more arenas, not
just focused on winning medals in the Asian Games in two years and in the 2012
Olympic Games, the official said.</P>

      <P>Consumer confidence in Taiwan's housing prices declined sharply in the second
quarter of 2008, indicating the country's housing market has begun to undergo a
downward correction, according to the results of a quarterly survey released
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted by the Institute for Physical Planning and Information
for the Council for Economic  Planning  and Development.</P>
      <P>The composite housing price confidence index stood at 90, down from 124 in the
previous quarter. Meanwhile, the confidence index for housing prices in the
future stood at 80, down from 120 in the previous quarter, the results showed.</P>
      <P>An index below 100 is indicative of pessimism, while one above 100 is indicative
of optimism.</P>
      <P>Among those looking to buy a home in Taipei City -- where housing prices are the
highest in the country -- the confidence index for housing prices in the future
dropped almost by half from 129.47 in the first quarter to 65.79 in the second
quarter.</P>
      <P>The survey found that 31 percent of potential home buyers thought home purchases
would cause a very heavy or extremely heavy burden on their living expenses.</P>
      <P>On average, potential home buyers expected to find a home ranging between NT$3
million and NT$6 million, lower than the average final selling price of NT$6.26
million recorded in the second quarter.</P>
      <P>In Taipei City in particular, the potential demand for housing properties
costing more than NT$12 million decreased by 7 percent in the second quarter.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Foreign Minister Francisco H.L. Ou said Tuesday that President Ma Ying-jeou
asked the foreign ministry to establish an inter-agency task force on the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) , a strategic move aimed at
strengthening relations  with the region and preventing  Taiwan from being
marginalized.</P>
      <P>"Located in the Southeast Asian region, how is Taiwan going to survive if it is
marginalized (by the ASEAN countries), " Ou said in an interview with the CNA.
"We have to find ways to cut into ASEAN."</P>
      <P>Ou said the task force will be set up following the model of the Taiwan-Japan
Relations Task Force, which reports regularly on foreign policy to the National
Security Council before making suggestions to the president, as Ma attaches
great importance to relations between Taiwan and ASEAN countries.</P>
      <P>He added that Ma issued the directive after listening to the foreign ministry's
report on work with the Middle East a day earlier.</P>
      <P>In his visit to the foreign ministry Aug. 4, Ma also contended that Taiwan
should be included in the expansion of ASEAN Plus One and ASEAN Plus Three,
asking "why not ten plus four? " Ma was referring to the fact that ASEAN
countries are engaging in serious negotiations with China, Japan and South Korea
to form Free Trade Agreements.</P>
      <P>Established in Thailand in 1967, ASEAN is made up of 10 member countries
including Thailand, Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Brunei,
Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, and Myanmar. Its objectives include the acceleration of
economic growth, social progress, cultural development among its members, and
the promotion of regional peace.</P>
      <P>Ou said if Taiwan does not work on strengthening relations with ASEAN countries,
it will be marginalized, as will its national interests.</P>
      <P>The Foreign Minister also noted that the ministry is considering setting up a
special unit in charge of handling relations with ASEAN and increasing
representative offices in the Southeast Asian region, adding that the unit would
also be responsible for coordination with other ministries.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan does not have representative offices in two ASEAN member
countries, Myanmar and Laos, Ou said that the ministry is planning to set up
representative offices in those two countries in order to have full presence in
all 10 ASEAN nations.</P>
      <P>He said the foreign ministry will submit a statement outlining the concrete
ideas of the task force to the president and premier in the near future.</P>

to promote tourism, organizers said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Ever since the Beiyi Freeway opened to traffic in 2006, the traffic flow on the

the way, the organizers said.</P>
      <P>According to the organizers, the racers will have to complete a 20-km section of
the road starting from the Wushih Harbor Visitor Center in Yilan county's
Toucheng township to the Shihpai Park which straddles the border between Taipei

    <TEXT>
      <P>Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu urged the central government in Taipei Tuesday to help
hold off a planned halt to weekend charter flights between Kaohsiung and
Guangzhou in China's Guangdong Province from September.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a municipal meeting, Chen urged the administration of President Ma
Ying-jeou to help reverse the decision by Taipei-based UNI Airways, which has
operated direct cross-Taiwan Strait weekend charter flights between the two
destinations from July 18, as a result of operating losses.</P>
      <P>"The Ma administration should do something in the face of the situation, as the
direct flight service has been implemented for less than two months," the mayor
said.</P>
      <P>Chen reminded Ma of his presidential campaign promise that "one third" of the
Chinese tourists visiting Taiwan would enter and leave Taiwan via Kaohsiung
International Airport to help boost business opportunities in the southern port
city.</P>
      <P>According to pacts signed in mid-June by Taiwan's quasi-official Straits
Exchange Foundation  and its Chinese counterpart,  the Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Straits, Taiwanese and Chinese carriers are allowed to operate
up to 36 weekend charter flights and up to 3, 000 Chinese tourists are allowed
to visit Taiwan per day from July 18, following several test runs on July's
first weekend.</P>
      <P>Director of the municipal Economic Affairs Bureau Liu Hsin-cheng suggested that
the central government allow the opening of more direct flights from Kaohsiung
to other Chinese destinations such as Beijing or Shanghai.</P>
      <P>"The Kaohsiung-Guangzhou weekend charter flights lack sufficient passengers, as
most of the China-based businessmen from southern Taiwan have their operations
in Guangdong's Dongguan or Shenzhen rather than in Guangzhou," Liu pointed out.</P>
      <P>"Those businessmen still prefer to travel between Taiwan and China via Hong Kong
or Macau," he added.</P>
      <P>Lin Shang-chih,  chairman  of the Kaohsiung  Travel Agency Association,
complained that only a few Taipei-based travel agencies are permitted to take on
Chinese tourists as clients, while those headquartered in other parts of Taiwan
are excluded.</P>
      <P>This unfair practice makes it very difficult for carriers and travel agencies
outside Taipei City to make a profit, he said, adding that the central
government should hold new talks with China to re-allot the cross-strait weekend
charter flights and destinations.</P>

      <P>A chief prosecutor in Taipei will depart for Singapore Wednesday to seeks its
help in Taiwan's probe into a suspected money laundering case embroiling former
President Chen Shui-bian and his family members, prosecutorial sources said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Ching  Chi-jen,  chief prosecutor  of the Taipei  District Prosecutors' Office,
will ask her Singaporean counterparts to file an application with a local court
to help look into the former first family's bank accounts in Singapore, the
sources said.</P>
      <P>At present, Taiwan and Singapore have no agreements on judicial assistance.
However, the sources said, Singapore's chief prosecutors' office has long
maintained a friendly relationship with Taiwan's prosecutorial authorities.</P>
      <P>Taiwan plans to seek help from Singapore because evidence has shown that the
former first family's overseas capital was wired to banks in Singapore and
Switzerland, the sources noted.</P>
      <P>Ching will return home Sept. 1, according to the sources.</P>
      <P>Former first lady Wu Shu-jen has previously told prosecutors that the overseas
bank accounts were opened for fund investment and that the money transfers were
made since Chen was elected as a lawmaker 20 years ago.</P>
      <P>She noted that two bank accounts are registered in the name of her older brother
Wu Ching-mao, and two other in the name of her daughter-in-law Huang Jui-ching.</P>
      <P>Her son, Chen Chih-chung, is an authorized proxy on all the bank accounts, Wu
said.</P>
      <P>Wu has denied corruption accusations and contended that the money, totalling
US$21 million, came from Chen's previous political election contributions,
previous income savings and investment earnings as well as Wu's dowry.</P>
      <P>The former president openly confessed Aug. 14 that he did not correctly report
his expenses from previous mayoral and presidential elections between 1993 and
2004.</P>
      <P>He also said that all the surplus funds were handled by his wife and that his
wife wired surplus funds from the election campaign contributions into overseas
bank accounts without informing him until early this year.</P>
      <P>Chen Shui-bian denied the money had any connection with the "state affairs fund"
case, in which the former first lady was charged with corruption and forgery in
November 2006 for using receipts provided by others to claim reimbursements
totaling NT$14.8 million from the president's "state affairs fund" between July
2002 and March 2006.</P>
      <P>Chen, who had immunity from prosecution while in office, was named as a suspect
in the case and was probed as soon as he stepped down from the presidency May
20.</P>

      <P>The unprecedented achievements by American athlete Michael Phelps in the
swimming events of the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games has given hope to many
Taiwanese parents with hyperactive children, a doctor in central Taiwan said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chen Chin-hung of the Chung Shan Medical University Hospital's Department of
Psychiatry, said Phelps -- who had attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder
(ADHD) when he was a child -- has set an example with his eight Olympic golds
for swimming of what a hyperactive child can achieve if his or her energy can be
channeled constructively.</P>
      <P>Chen pointed out that ADHD is most commonly diagnosed in children and that the
best time to treat its symptoms is during the elementary school period.</P>
      <P>The disorder is still considered a chronic condition for which no medical cure
is available, although medication and behavioral therapy can treat the symptoms.</P>
      <P>About 4 percent to 12 percent of the world's children are affected by ADHD and
domestic studies show that between 7.5 percent and 9.9 percent of the children
born in Taiwan have the condition, according to Chen.</P>
      <P>Chen added that 30 percent of these hyperactive children can have their
conditions stabilized during their adolescence, while another 30 percent do not
improve until during their college years.</P>
      <P>As for the remaining 30 percent, he went on, they remain hyperactive in
adulthood, and can tend to display such symptoms as poor concentration,  running
red lights and driving under the influence of alcohol.</P>
      <P>The psychiatrist also said that new medicines developed in recent years can
improve concentration  in 80 percent of hyperactive children, and that with
appropriate treatment, 60 percent of the children he has treated have shown
progress in their academic performance.</P>
      <P>Phelps, 23, was a hyperactive child who was unable to contain his energy,
according to his mother. "He never sat still, never closed his mouth, was always
asking questions, always jumping from one thing to another," she is reported as
having said.</P>
      <P>Although Phelps started taking medication and undergoing behavior modification
at 9, he stopped taking his medication two years later and had his ADHD symptoms
controlled by channeling his energy into swimming, so that by the time he was 16
he became a top-class athlete.</P>
      <P>In his Beijing triumph, Phelps captured eight gold medals, breaking Mark Spitz's
seven golds achieved at the Munich Olympics in 1972.</P>

      <P>National security should be top concerns in evaluating the feasibility of
constructing a bridge connecting the Taiwan-controlled island of Kinmen and the
nearby Chinese city of Xiamen, despite increasing exchanges between the two
sides, Defense Minister Chen Chao-min said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chen made the declaration to reporters in response to questions on the proposed
project, about which President Ma Ying-jeou said during a visit to Kinmen Sunday
he has adopted an open attitude.</P>
      <P>Ma said that policy will be formed to decide whether or not to build the bridge,
proposed by the Kinmen county government as part of efforts to promote local
economic development, after all relevant evaluations have been carried out.</P>
      <P>Addressing the Ministry of National Defense's (MND's) evaluation, Chen said that
"it is not possible to achieve the goal at present" because Beijing has never
displayed "goodwill, " a reference to China's refusal to dismantle thousands of
missiles targeting Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Without taking national security into consideration, "we would be caught off
guard" if the communists take military action to invade Taiwan, Chen said.</P>
      <P>He reiterated that the MND's top task is to safeguard national security.</P>
      <P>Asked why the MND allows military officers and soldiers to believe that
communist China remains their targeted enemy despite the thawing of relations
between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, Chen said that it is the
government's policy to pursue peace in the strait.</P>
      <P>However, since China remains reluctant to show goodwill toward Taiwan, now is
not the time for the military to be off-guard in the face of Beijing's continued
military threat, Chen noted.</P>
      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan described the Kinmen-Xiamen  bridge construction
proposal as "forward looking" Sunday when he inspected the planned site for the
bridge with Ma.</P>
      <P>Liu said he will include the proposal in future cross-strait talks. When
construction might be likely to begin, however, will be dependent on the future
development of cross-strait ties, he noted.</P>

      <P>The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) expects to negotiate with China on easing
visa restrictions on Chinese visitors following President Ma Ying-jeou's
announcement Sunday that the government plans to offer landing visas or
multiple-entry visas to Chinese visitors to the islands of Kinmen and Matsu.</P>
      <P>MAC spokesman Liu Teh-hsun said Tuesday that the administration came up with the
plan after thorough assessments by the government.</P>
      <P>The measure was proposed based on the principle of reciprocity, as 11 Chinese
cities, such as Haiko, Shanya, Xiamen, Fuzhou, and Shanghai, allow entry of
Taiwanese tourists on landing visas, Liu added.</P>
      <P>He also said the measure is aimed at attracting more Chinese tourists to Kinmen
and Matsu by granting them preferential visa treatment and lessening the impact
of the July 4 opening of direct cross-Taiwan Strait charter flights and direct
transport links between the two islands and the Chinese province of Fujian,
according to Liu.</P>
      <P>While the procedures of visa application will be simplified and will take less
time, Chinese tourists will still need to submit applications to the National
Immigration Agency and obtain its approval before they can get landing visas or
multiple-entry visas, Liu added.</P>
      <P>Noting that the measures will be implemented on a trial basis, Liu downplayed
concerns that they might pose a threat to national security.</P>
      <P>He said that in an effort to attract more Chinese tourists to the two islands,
the government  will negotiate with the Chinese authorities on locations for
offices that will handle visa matters, to minimize the time Chinese tourists
will have to wait for visa approval.</P>
      <P>Ma, who made the announcement on Kinmen Sunday while marking the 50th
anniversary of the 823 Artillery Battle, said the proposal is aimed at boosting
the outlying islands' economic development and making travel to Kinmen and Matsu
more convenient for Chinese tourists.</P>

      <P>A tourism promotion group composed of Taipei County officials and local business
executives will depart Wednesday for Shandong Province in northern China, where
it will attend an international travel fair in the provincial capital to entice
Chinese tourists, a county official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Apart from the county's natural landscapes and tourism facilities and resorts,
the delegation will focus on wedding photos and medical tourism to woo potential
Chinese visitors at the international travel fair in Jinan City, the county's
Tourism Bureau Director Chin Hui-chu said at a news conference prior to
departure.</P>
      <P>The Taipei county government decided to send the delegation to the event in
anticipation of a new wave of Chinese tourists coming to Taiwan now that the
Beijing Olympics have finished, despite the current low numbers of Chinese
tourists visiting Taiwan, said Chin.</P>
      <P>"The county  hopes to cash in on the potential  business opportunities that
might emerge along with expected larger numbers of Chinese tourists to Taiwan
after the Olympic Games," she explained.</P>
      <P>In line with two landmark pacts signed by Taiwan and China in mid-June in
Beijing, Taiwan agreed to permit up to 3,000 Chinese tourists to visit Taiwan
per day and to establish direct weekend charter flights between the two sides of
the Taiwan Strait from July 18.</P>
      <P>Chin predicted that travel costs for visits by Chinese tourists might be
substantially slashed after the two sides hold the next round of two-way talks,
slated for late October or early November.</P>
      <P>Shandong Province, due to its growing economic clout, was among the first
Chinese cities and provinces authorized by Beijing to allow its residents to
travel overseas, she noted.</P>

to statistics released Tuesday by the county government's Bureau of Social
Affairs.</P>
      <P>According to the bureau, figures from a recent census show that Kaohsiung County

      <P>The figures also show that the percentage of elderly people in Kaohsiung County
rose from 7 percent in 1993 to 9.99 percent in July this year.</P>
      <P>Of them, 52 were centenarians -- 36 women and 16 men -- the oldest of whom was
107 years old.</P>
      <P>Bureau officials said the county government will present each of the
centenarians with a red envelope containing NT$10,000 (US$315) on Chong Yang

08/26/08  21:45:52

    <TEXT>
      <P>An environmental impact assessment panel postponed Tuesday its decision over the
construction plan for a coal-fired power plant located in the Changhua Coastal
Industrial Park in central Taiwan, after environmentalists accused the Taiwan
Power Company (Taipower) of submitting a thinly disguised previously rejected
plan.</P>
      <P>The review  meeting,  originally  convened  to review  the construction plan,
was interrupted when environmentalists claimed that the plan was turned down in
April last year due to the considerable carbon dioxide emissions and the
potential impact on local residents' health that the plant would have. The plan
was withdrawn by Taipower two months later.</P>
      <P>Taipower, however, introduced a similar plan this year to the Environmental
Protection Administration (EPA) , a plan that the environmentalists described as
"old wine in a new bottle."</P>
      <P>"If the environmental impact assessment panel creates a precedent (by
recognizing the Taipower's construction plan as a new one) , all construction
plans can be approved this way, " said Thomas Chan, an attorney representing the
environmentalists at the meeting.</P>
      <P>According to the Environmental Impact Assessment Law, Taipower is entitled to
withdraw the plan and submit a new one. However, because of the controversy, the
EPA will now request the Ministry of Justice to interpret the related clauses in
the law.</P>
      <P>However, Taipower representatives insisted that the plan is new, as
supplementary information about protected animals and migratory birds have been
included.</P>
      <P>They also said that even with the new power plant's carbon dioxide emissions,
the total emissions of the industrial park will not exceed emission quantities
permitted by the EPA.</P>
      <P>They argued that the power plant is necessary in order to ensure electricity
supplies and raise the park's energy efficiency.</P>
      <P>The construction of the power plant might help boost industrial development and
create jobs in the region, said Huang Chiu-ming, leader of a community
association in Changhua County's Lukang township.</P>
      <P>The environmentalists are strongly opposed to the project, insisting that the
new plant will emit at least 8 million tons of carbon dioxide per year,
accounting for 3 percent of Taiwan's total annual carbon dioxide emissions.</P>
      <P>They also said that the Taichung coal-fired power plant, located only 15 km from
the designated site of the new plant, has caused serious acid rain in central
Taiwan, inflicting considerable damage not only on residents' health but also on
local historic monuments.</P>
      <P>The Taichung coal-fired power plant has been listed by the international
scientific journal Nature as the most polluting power plant in the world,
emitting 37 million metric tons of carbon dioxide in 2007 alone.</P>
      <P>In addition, environmentalists claimed that sousa chinensis, a rare species of
white dolphin, are living under threat due to coastal industrial development.
The dolphins, indigenous to Taiwan, were classified by the International Union
for Conservation of Nature as "critically endangered" Aug. 13 this year.</P>
      <P>According to the Wild at Heart Legal Defense Association, the dolphins live
mainly around the island's western coast and at present number only about 70.</P>

      <P>Taiwan has asked the Palau government to send a patrol boat to waters near the
island to intercept a Taiwanese fishing boat that is suspected of having been
hijacked by its Indonesian crew, the Fisheries Agency under the Cabinet-level
Council of Agriculture disclosed Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Fisheries Agency officials said the request for help was made through the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the agency also informed 11 Taiwanese fishing boats operating in the
vicinity to provide assistance to the boat, the Tai Yi Hsiang, if they see it,
the officials said.</P>
      <P>The boat's captain, Li Feng-bao, is the only Taiwanese national aboard the
vessel, which is manned by an eight-strong Indonesian crew.</P>
      <P>Information provided by a ship position monitoring system showed that the Tai Yi
Hsiang -- a 69.4-ton longliner registered with Pingtung County's Liouciou
township in southern Taiwan -- was located about 200 nautical miles east of the
Philippines within Palau's economic exclusion zone and was sailing south in the

Indonesian crew, who were hired through a labor brokerage firm and were working
for Li for the first time.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Tuesday that Taiwan will immediately resume its
diplomatic war with China if Beijing does not accept a truce with Taipei in the
diplomatic arena.</P>
      <P>Ma said in an interview with the local Chinese-language magazine Global Views
Monthly that it will soon be clear if China has rejected the truce proposed by
Taiwan when he took office May 20.</P>
      <P>He dismissed criticism that the government is engaged in wishful thinking in the
thawing relations with China and said that "it takes two to tango."</P>
      <P>He also said it is impossible  to make a great leap in cross-Taiwan Strait
relations and that advancement should be done incrementally.</P>
      <P>He argued that the two sides already enjoy mutual trust, otherwise cross-strait
weekend charter flights would not have been implemented July 4, less than two
months after he was sworn in.</P>
      <P>China claims sovereignty over self-ruled Taiwan and threatens war if Taiwan
moves toward formal independence.</P>
      <P>Contrary to his predecessor Chen Shui-bian, who favors formal independence for
Taiwan, Ma has proposed pragmatic diplomacy, which he said focuses on
workability and flexibility while maintaining the country's interests and
dignity.</P>
      <P>Ma said that during his first state visit to Paraguay and the Dominican Republic
between Aug. 12-19, he met the heads of state of Taiwan's six diplomatic allies
in Central and South America and eight presidents of countries friendly toward
Taiwan but which do not have diplomatic relations with Taipei.</P>
      <P>The results of the visit were far better than he had been expecting, he said.</P>
      <P>During his visit, Ma said he did not talk about financial aid and added that
under the cross-strait diplomatic truce, Taiwan no longer needs to engage in the
widely criticized "checkbook diplomacy" to buy new allies.</P>
      <P>In the future, Taiwan's financial aid will not focus on seeking to establish
ties with other countries but on fulfilling its responsibility as a member of
the international community, he went on.</P>
      <P>He added that the Netherlands' and Japan's foreign financial aid accounted for
0.7 percent of their GDP, a figure set by the United Nations, when their per
capita income reached US$17,000-US$18,000, the level of Taiwan's present per
capita income.</P>
      <P>At present, however, Taiwan's financial aid only accounts for 0.15 percent of
its GDP, Ma said, adding that its financial aid only focuses on the 23 countries
that recognize Taiwan's statehood.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Penghu county government has recently asked the central government to allow
Chinese visitors to Penghu to be granted landing visas to help boost local
tourism, but the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) said Tuesday that the visa issue
will only be addressed after regular direct transport links between Penghu and
China are opened.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou recently revealed a plan to offer landing visas or
multiple-entry visas to Chinese travelers to Kinmen, a Taiwan-controlled island
close to the southeastern coast of China, as part of efforts to accelerate local
economic development and increase the number of Chinese tourists traveling to
Kinmen.</P>
      <P>The initiative prompted Penghu residents to call for similar treatment for
Chinese visitors to their offshore county.</P>
      <P>In his response, MAC Deputy Chairman Fu Don-cheng said that at present, the
first thing to do is to overhaul the regulations governing travel between Penghu
and China via Kinmen or Matsu to make regular direct links possible.</P>
      <P>Efforts began in July to try to expand the links, Fu revealed, noting that it is
expected that direct transport links between Penghu and China will be achieved
before the two sides of the Taiwan Strait sign an agreement on the launch of
overall direct cross-strait maritime links.</P>
      <P>At the moment, direct maritime links with China exist only for Kinmen and Matsu
-- two outlying islands that are closer to China than to Taiwan proper.</P>
      <P>Speaking of the planned granting of landing visa privileges to Chinese visitors
to Kinmen and Matsu, Fu said the new measure will be carried out on a trial
basis, after which an evaluation will be conducted before the government decides
whether or not to expand the visa privileges.</P>

      <P>A new round of negotiations between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait slated
for this autumn will discuss issues regarding  an exchange of visa-issuing
offices,  Taiwan's top negotiator with China said in Tokyo Tuesday.</P>
      <P>"The proposed exchange of visa offices is aimed at attracting more Chinese
tourists to Taiwan and offering easier access for Taiwan businessmen seeking to
tap into the vast Chinese market," said Chiang Pin-kung, chairman of the Straits
Exchange Foundation (SEF).</P>
      <P>Chiang, a vice chairman of the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) , is visiting Japan in
his capacity as head of the SEF, a quasi-official intermediary body authorized
to handle negotiations and exchanges with China in the absence of official ties
between the two sides.</P>
      <P>Chiang told a group of Japanese journalists that the SEF and its Chinese
counterpart -- the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS)
-- will hold a new round of talks in Taipei in October or November.</P>
      <P>The agenda items will also include issues regarding turning the existing weekend
direct cross-strait charter flights into regular flight services, Chiang went
on.</P>
      <P>Predicting that the exchange of visa offices and expansion of flight services
will boost civic exchanges,  Chiang said such interaction will boost mutual
understanding, which might eventually inspire China to think about overhauling
its political system and to refer to Taiwan's political and economic development
formula for adopting democracy.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, Chiang delivered a speech on the latest developments in
cross-strait relations at the headquarters of the Nippon Keidanren (Japan
Business Federation) , one of the largest economic organizations in Japan.</P>
      <P>In his speech, Chiang said the coming five to 10 years will be crucial to
Taiwan's development and that whether the two sides of the Taiwan Strait will
enjoy lasting peace will rely on their leaders' visions and determination,
particularly President Ma Ying-jeou's courage and wisdom.</P>
      <P>Chiang is accompanied by four KMT lawmakers Lee Hung-chun, Lee Chia-chin, Lee
Fu-hsing and Lin Yu-fang.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Prosecutor to seek help in Singapore in money-laundering probe</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 27 (CNA)
08/27/08  12:27:32

    <TEXT>
      <P>A local prosecutor departed Wednesday for Singapore to seek assistance in
Taiwan's ongoing investigation into a case of suspected money laundering
involving former President Chen Shui-bian and his family.</P>
      <P>Ching Chi-jen, head prosecutor of the Taipei District Prosecutors Office, who is
scheduled to attend the 13th annual conference of the International Association
of Prosecutors Aug. 27-31 in the city state, is expected to request Singaporean
authorities to help look into the bank accounts in Singapore created under the
names of members of the former first family.</P>
      <P>The former president's daughter-in-law Huang Jui-ching and his wife's elder
brother Wu Ching-mao -- two nominal holders of the former family's overseas bank
accounts -- as well as his son Chen Chih-chung -- an authorized proxy on the
accounts -- have all refused to sign authorization letters allowing prosecutors
to scrutinize the accounts.</P>
      <P>Ching told the media shortly before her departure that while it will help speed
up the collection of evidence if the prosecutors are authorized by the holders
to check the accounts, evidence obtained through international judicial
assistance will be more comprehensive although it may take longer.</P>
      <P>Ching had traveled to Switzerland before on Aug. 12 for a similar purpose.</P>
      <P>Taiwan authorities were informed in January by the international anti-money
laundering organization Egmont Group that members of the former first family had
created a number of bank accounts in other countries, including the United
States, the Cayman Islands, Singapore and Switzerland.</P>
      <P>In July, Taiwan further received a request by Swiss authorities for assistance
in probing alleged money laundering by Chen Chih-chung and Huang Jui-ching in
Switzerland.</P>
      <P>Suspecting that the money wired overseas could be connected to the "state
affairs fund" embezzlement case implicating the former president and his wife Wu
Shu-jen, prosecutors last week listed Chen Shui-bian, Wu Shu-jen, Chen Chih-
chung, Huang Jui-ching and Wu Ching-mao as suspects in the case of alleged money
laundering.</P>
      <P>However, Wu Shu-jen, said to be the manager of the family's finances, claimed
that the US$21 million deposited overseas had been obtained  legally  from four
sources --  surplus of political contributions for the campaigns of her husband,
her husband's practice as a lawyer before he went into politics, her own dowry
and her investments.</P>
      <P>Wu's statement was consistent with that of Chen Shui-bian, who openly confessed
Aug. 14 that he did not honestly account for his election campaign expenses and
that his wife had wired surplus funds from the election campaign contributions
into overseas bank accounts.</P>
      <P>Chen claimed that all the surplus funds were handled by his wife and that he had
no idea until early this year that his wife had wired the funds abroad.</P>
      <P>The former president denied the money had any connection with the "state affairs
fund" case, in which the former first lady was charged with corruption and
forgery in November 2006 for using receipts provided by others to claim
reimbursements totaling NT$14.8 million from the president's "state affairs
fund" between July 2002 and March 2006.</P>
      <P>Chen, who had immunity from prosecution while in office, was named as a co-
offender in the case and was probed as soon as he stepped down from the
presidency May 20.</P>

      <P>Three close aides of former President Chen Shui-bian who were involved in
handling Chen's campaign funds between 2000-2008 were subpoenaed Wednesday for
questioning.</P>
      <P>The three former Presidential Office staff members -- Chen Chen-hui, head
cashier; Ma Yung-cheng, deputy secretary general; and Kuo Wen-ping, a secretary
-- were summoned for questioning regarding the flow of Chen's campaign funds and
the first couple's suspected embezzlement of "special state affairs funds"
budgeted for Chen's discretionary use as president, the Special Investigation
Division under the Supreme Prosecutors Office said.</P>
      <P>The trio was still being questioned as witnesses as of press time.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors also subpoenaed other people closely related to Chen over the
past several days for questioning after Chen and his wife, Wu Shu-jen, their son
Chen Chih-chung, daughter-in-law Huang Jui-ching, and Wu's elder brother Wu
Ching-mao were listed as suspects and banned from leaving the country in a case
of suspected overseas money laundering.</P>
      <P>The others who had been summoned for questioning included Huang Fang-yen, Wu's
confidant and deputy superintendent of the Shin Kong Wu Ho Su Memorial Hospital;
Chiou I-jen, former National Security Council secretary general; and Huang Wei-
sheng, chairman of the Bian Mao Factory and a big donor to Chen's campaigns.</P>
      <P>During questioning by prosecutors last Friday, the former first lady said the
US$21 million in overseas bank accounts under the name of her elder brother and
daughter-in-law was surplus funds from political contributions for the campaigns
of her husband in two mayoral elections and two presidential elections from 1993
to 2004.</P>
      <P>During questioning Monday, Chen's daughter-in-law Huang Jui-ching said that she
was used as a "figurehead" by her mother-in-law to open bank accounts overseas
to facilitate cash deposits.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  Chu  Chao-liang,  spokesman  for  the  Special Investigation
Division,  confirmed  Wednesday that the Supreme Prosecutors Office has received
a tip-off by Chang Chi-ming, chairman of Taipei's Pacific Life Co., accusing
that Far Eastern Group Chairman Douglas Hsu had donated some US$10 million to
Chen in 2004 to gain help in an attempt to acquire the store.</P>
      <P>The donation was remitted to Chen's overseas bank accounts held under the names
of "figureheads," according to Chang.</P>

at the Chiku Lagoon, Taiwan's largest, on the last two days of the county's
annual tourism and ecology promotion activity.</P>
      <P>The county government extended the activity, which was supposed to take place
every weekend from July 26-Aug. 7, because it proved far more popular than
originally predicted, Su said.</P>
      <P>The activity, which began in 1997, is aimed at introducing the lagoon's diverse
ecological resources to the public in the hope of drawing more support for the
county government's efforts to preserve the wetland area.</P>
      <P>The lagoon is bounded by four offshore sandbanks that are habitats for many
wetland species such as crabs, oysters, clams, shrimps and fish. The lagoon is
also known for being the winter habitat of the migratory black-faced spoonbill.</P>
      <P>Su said the public can be ferried on bamboo rafts to the sandbanks, where they
can wade in the shallow water and collect clams.</P>
      <P>While there, they will have great opportunities to observe all kinds of flora

and riding banana boats, Su said.</P>

      <P>The ministry asked Palau authorities to help search for the fishing boat after
the captain's family members lost contact with the captain on Aug. 19.</P>
      <P>The Fisheries Agency later located the boat through a satellite monitoring

    <TEXT>
      <P>Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) Director-General Lee Long-wen said
Wednesday, in response to Uni Air's decision to cancel charter service on the
Kaohsiung-Guangzhou route, that the CAA does not have the authority to tell
airlines on which routes they should offer flights.</P>
      <P>The Taipei-based carrier said that it has decided to halt its service on the
route due to low passenger numbers.</P>
      <P>Service on the route began July 4 with the launch of weekend charter flights
that same weekend under an accord signed in Beijing between the heads of
Taiwan's quasi-official  Straits Exchange Foundation and its Chinese
counterpart, the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits.</P>
      <P>Uni Air said that despite the fact that the average passenger load on the
Kaohsiung-Guangzhou flights reached about 70 percent, the figure for the return
flights was a lowly 40-50 percent.</P>
      <P>As a result, based on considerations of operating costs, the airline said it
decided to temporarily halt the charter service.</P>
      <P>It stressed, however, that it could reopen the service in the future if there is
sufficient demand.</P>
      <P>On Uni Air's decision, Lee said that the CAA could not force airlines to operate
services on specific routes, pointing out that the decision is dependent on
market forces.</P>
      <P>"Wherever there are passengers, airlines will offer flights," he added.</P>
      <P>Since the launch of cross-strait weekend charter services, only one flight per
week has been offered on the Kaohsiung-Guangzhou route, with the exception of
the second week in July when China Airlines offered one flight.</P>
      <P>After the accord between the SEF and ARATS was signed, eight airports  in
Taiwan,  including  Taipei's  Songshan,  Taoyuan International Airport and those
in Taichung, Kaohsiung, Hualien and Taitung, were designated to handle the
cross-strait charter flights.</P>
      <P>However, none of the airlines applied to fly from Kaohsiung International
Airport until the last minute when Uni Air stepped in to offer flights between
the southern port city and Guangzhou.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan begins preparations for 2012 Olympics in London</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Sports Affairs Council (SAC) has proposed a new preparatory
program for the 2012 London Olympics, as part of its 2009 budget plan which was
submitted to the Legislative Yuan Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The SAC's NT$1 billion (US$31.73 million) proposal came in the wake of what was
seen as a disappointing performance by Taiwanese athletes in the recently
concluded Beijing Olympics.</P>
      <P>Of the total budget planned for the 2012 Olympics preparation program, NT$100
million will be allocated for spending in the first fiscal year, the SAC said.</P>
      <P>The SAC proposed spending NT$5.6 billion in 2009 on projects such as increasing
the sports population,  reinforcing training for athletes, constructing premium
sports facilities, and bidding to host international  sports events and to join
international  sports organizations.</P>
      <P>The SAC also said it hopes that Taiwanese athletes will achieve inspiring
performances in international games, which would mean more medals.</P>
      <P>In its proposal, the SAC listed plans to construct 10 sports centers around the
country in 2009 in an effort to realize President Ma Ying-jeou's election
promise of building 70 sports centers during his four-year tenure that began May
20.</P>
      <P>Taiwan won four bronze medals in the Beijing Olympics which ended last Sunday.
The achievement did not impress the Taiwan public, which had hoped for at least
a repeat of Taiwan's best performance ever in the Olympics when it snagged two
gold, two silver and one bronze medals in the 2004 Games.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A business conglomerate energy saving service corps was established Wednesday
under the sponsorship of the Ministry of Economic Affairs' Bureau of Energy.</P>
      <P>The core purpose of the group is to help leading manufacturing companies, which
are also major energy consumers, save energy and cut carbon dioxide emissions by
providing training to staff members in these companies to become "seeded
trainers" responsible for promoting these efforts in their companies, said Yeh
Hui-ching, director of the Bureau of Energy.</P>
      <P>At an inaugural ceremony, representatives of 12 conglomerates -- including
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) , Formosa Plastics Group, Yuen
Foong Yu Paper Mfg. Group, Lee Chang Yung Chemical, Silconware Precision
Industries, Macronix International and Walsin Technology -- vowed to cut energy
use by six percent in three years, a volume equivalent to 781,000 kiloliters of
oil equivalent (approximately 4.9 million barrels of oil).</P>
      <P>"The amount of the energy saved can also be expressed as NT$16.6 billion (US$535
million) saved or a reduction of carbon dioxide emissions by 2.14 million tons
that would require trees equivalent to 5,502 Ta-an Forest Parks to absorb," Yeh
said.</P>
      <P>The 12 participating conglomerates, involving 116 companies, consume almost 76
million barrels of oil a year, constituting about 19.2 percent of all the energy
consumed by all industries in Taiwan, or 9.9 percent of all the energy consumed
by all sectors in the country, Yeh added.</P>
      <P>He stressed that the administration has set goals to reduce the carbon dioxide
emissions of Taiwan -- which is currently ranked the 11th major emission country
in the world -- to 2008's levels by 2016 and to 2000's levels by 2025.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Huang Tsung-ching, a manager of the Formosa Plastics Group, who
represented all the participating companies to receive a banner from the Bureau
of Energy marking the launch of the emission-cutting service corps, said Formosa
Plastics began to make similar efforts immediately after the Kyoto Protocol went
into effect in February 2005, even though Taiwan was not a signature party nor a
United Nations member.</P>
      <P>"Formosa  Plastics established  its own energy saving and emission-cutting task
force in 2005 and asked for help from BSI British Standards to facilitate the
company's efforts to save water and reduce consumption of carbon-emitting fuels,
such as coal, oil and natural gas," Huang said.</P>
      <P>"We have even trained 309 seeded specialists to beef up the energy-saving
drive," Huang added.</P>
      <P>Taking the Sixth Naphtha Cracking Plant run by Formosa Plastics as an example,
he said, a total of 708 programs have been put forth in the plant complex,
targeted at cutting carbon dioxide emissions by 5.05 million tons.</P>
      <P>"So far 435 programs have been implemented, contributing to a reduction of 3.05
million tons of greenhouse gases," he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Green light for Taipower nuclear waste dump in Taipei County</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) gave conditional approval Wednesday to
the Taiwan Power Company (Taipower) to build an interim dump in Taipei County
for spent nuclear fuel rods from the neighboring First Nuclear Power Plant.</P>
      <P>An environmental impact assessment panel under the EPA gave the green light on
condition that Taipower promises not to make the repository a final disposal
site and that the company should "try to purchase" residents' properties near
the designated repository.</P>
      <P>In addition, a supervisory commission organized by residents can be set up to
monitor construction of the repository, according to the panel.</P>
      <P>Unsatisfied with the panel's decision, however, residents said they will stage
large-scale protests against Taipower.</P>
      <P>The First Nuclear Power Plant, located in the county's Shihmen township, has
been operational since 1978 and is expected to be decommissioned in 2018.</P>
      <P>According to the panel's decision, spent nuclear fuel rods can be stored in the
planned repository for maximum of 40 years, after which Taipower will have to
relocate the waste to a final disposal site.</P>
      <P>As the current waste dump can only store spent fuel from nuclear reactors for 30
years, Taipower must present a construction plan to the EPA for a 0.45-hectare
spent fuel rod repository.</P>
      <P>Taipower representatives claimed that if the plan is postponed, Taiwan's
electricity supply might be affected in the near future, as the spent fuel rod
repository will be full by March 2010.</P>
      <P>However, local residents questioned Taipower's intention to build in their
hometown a repository that will have a lifespan of 50 years.</P>
      <P>"If the First Nuclear Power Plant will be decommissioned in 10 years, why not
find a permanent disposal site right away? " asked Shihmen township head Liang
Yu-hsue, claiming that Taipower might be intending to use the repository as a
final dumping site.</P>
      <P>According  to the Nuclear Materials and Radioactive  Waste Management Act,
Taipower should have the final disposal facility for its nuclear waste built and
in operation by 2055, but the company is still looking for an appropriate
location.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, about 500 Taipei County residents protesting outside the EPA building
claimed that their health is being threatened by radioactivity and that cancer
is more prevalent in their townships than in other parts of the country.</P>
      <P>In response,  the Taipower representatives  argued that an increasing cancer
rate is a nationwide phenomenon and that cancer rates in townships near the
nuclear plant are no higher than elsewhere.</P>
      <P>"The barrels of the type used to store the spent nuclear fuel rods have been
used in the United States for over 20 years, and their stability and strength
are proven, " Tu Yueh-yuan, chief engineer and Taipower spokesman, told CNA.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has three nuclear power plants with a fourth under construction.
President Ma Ying-jeou has expressed his support for nuclear energy development
in order to reduce Taiwan's carbon dioxide emissions while meeting the
increasing demand for electricity.</P>

      <P>Fifty young volunteers who completed a six-week training program at Taiwan's
International Cooperation and Development Fund (ICDF) will participate in
overseas service using their expertise to help various developing countries, the
ICDF announced Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Minister of Foreign Affairs Francisco Ou presided over a ceremony to mark the
completion of the training program at the Civil Service Development Institute in
Taipei in his capacity as chairman of the ICDF.</P>
      <P>The 50 volunteers are equipped with different specialties, including the
teaching of the Chinese language, physical education, culinary  arts,
agricultural  consultation  and  environmental protection.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the ceremony, Ou said this will be the 13th group dispatched by the
government to help developing countries that maintain friendly relations with
Taiwan. Ou pointed out that since the overseas volunteer assistance program was
created in 1993, Taiwan has sent 320 long-term and short-term volunteer workers
with different specialties to help developing countries all over the world.</P>
      <P>The foreign minister encouraged the new volunteer group to convey to the world
the message that Taiwan is willing  to participate in cooperation with the
international community.</P>
      <P>As for the volunteers themselves, they can also benefit from the overseas
service by broadening their horizons, improving their foreign language
proficiency and enriching their life experience, Ou said.</P>
      <P>The ICDF is a semi-official organization combining government and private-sector
resources to carry out Taiwan's international aid programs -- similar to the
role of America's USAID.</P>
      <P>The fund's overseas assistance covers four areas: investment and lending
operations, technical cooperation, international human resource development, and
humanitarian assistance.</P>

      <P>Supported by the Government Information Office (GIO) , two Taiwanese artistic
groups will perform in Europe and South America, respectively, in the hope of
enhancing cultural exchanges and expanding diplomatic space, said GIO Minister
Vanessa Yea-ping Shih Wednesday.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan has always been proud of its democratic and economic achievements, but
another precious asset of the country, Taiwan's beautiful culture and art, is
often neglected," said Shih at a press conference.</P>
      <P>The two groups are the Taiyuan Puppet Theater Company and the Formosa Aboriginal
Song and Dance Troupe.</P>
      <P>Chen Xi-huang, the 78 year-old performer of the Taiyuan Puppet Theater Company,
has performed in foreign countries for more than 20 years, said Wu Shan-shan,
the company's director-general of art.</P>
      <P>"Overcoming linguistic barriers, master Chen has successfully helped foreigners
appreciate the beauty of Taiwan's puppet theater through rhythm and various
actions," she said.</P>
      <P>The Formosa Aboriginal Song and Dance Troupe, founded in 1991, is composed of
young indigenous people from different tribes in Taiwan. Its past performance in
the United States won favorable comments from the New York Times, which paid
high tribute to the "authority,  simplicity, and radiant humanity" emitted by
the performers.</P>
      <P>According to the GIO, the Taiyuan Puppet Theater Company will perform in Europe
from late September to late October, appearing in France,  Hungary,  Germany and
the Czech Republic, while the indigenous troupe will leave for the South America
in early September for cultural exchanges with local indigenous people in
Nicaragua, Guatemala, Peru and the Dominican Republic.</P>

      <P>It would take cross-strait negotiations to facilitate the implementation of
Taiwan's granting landing visas or multiple entry visas to Chinese visitors to
Kinmen, an official of the intermediary  body Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF)
said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>SEF Vice Chairman and Secretary-General Kao Koong-lien said it would be
difficult for Taiwan to realize the landing visa treatment by unilaterally
planning for it because it "takes two to tango, " meaning that if China does not
work actively on the matter, the plan would only be a plan.</P>
      <P>Kao said the SEF has talked with its Chinese counterpart, the Beijing-based
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS), on expanded
application of the "mini three links" -- direct postal, trade and transport
links between Taiwan's outlying islands of Kinmen and Matsu and the cities of
Xiamen and Fuzhou in China's Fujian Province -- but had been told by ARATS that
"currently it is difficult for China to implement it."</P>
      <P>Kao said as far as he knows, potential Chinese tourists to Taiwan need to apply
for an entry permit from Taiwan's National Immigration Agency first, before
approching Chinese authorities to apply for travel documents to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"It takes three to five days for the Chinese tourists to obtain a Taiwan entry
permit, but it takes one to two weeks for them to obtain approval from Chinese
authorities," Kao noted.</P>
      <P>"There will be a long way to go for Chinese tourists to be issued landing visas
to visit Kinmen if the Chinese side does not do something positive quickly," Kao
asserted.</P>
      <P>President Ma said in a speech delivered in Kinmen Sunday that to accelerate
Kinmen's economic development and facilitate Chinese tourists' traveling to
Kinmen, his administration is planning to offer landing visas or multiple entry
visas to Chinese visitors to Kinmen.</P>

      <P>The Interior Ministry opened a two-day international anti-human trafficking
seminar Wednesday with the goal of consolidating a campaign against human
trafficking by establishing a comprehensive government system.</P>
      <P>"Anti-human trafficking is not only work that takes long term efforts but is
also a challenge  that requires  international cooperation and attention, " said
Deputy Interior Minister Chien Tai-lang, who is also acting director-general of
the National Immigration Agency.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks in his opening speech at the seminar, titled the "2008 Anti-
Human Trafficking International Workshop, " which took place at the National
Taiwan University Hospital International Convention Center in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan has been listed as a Tier 2 country for the second straight
year by the United States in its annual anti-human trafficking report, Chien
said the ministry has completed a draft proposal on anti-human trafficking to be
submitted to the Executive Yuan at the end of August and that it is expected to
be enacted by the Legislative Yuan in its next session.</P>
      <P>He added that the government is determined to fight human trafficking,
evidenced by the "anti-human trafficking project" launched  by  the  Executive
Yuan  in  November  2006,  an inter-governmental agency task force on anti-human
trafficking that was established in 2007, and a chapter on anti-human
trafficking that was added to the immigration law.</P>
      <P>"I hope that Taiwan will be upgraded to a Tier 1 country because of these
efforts on anti-human trafficking," Chien said.</P>
      <P>The Trafficking in Persons Report 2008 (TIF 2008) , released by the U.S.
Department of State June 6, places Taiwan on a list of "Tier 2" countries in
terms of human trafficking, the same level it was ranked at last year.</P>
      <P>The TIF 2008 describes Taiwan as a destination for men, women and children
trafficked for the purposes of forced labor and sexual exploitation. Taiwan is
also a source of women trafficked to Japan, Australia, the United Kingdom and
the U.S., according to the report.</P>
      <P>Participants in the international seminar include officials from the U.S.
Department of Homeland Security and Customs Bureau. Among them are Tatum S.

      <P>The problem of child sexual abuse may be more prevalent than the public
realizes, with the actual number of victims estimated at approximately 20,000
per year, although only around 3,000 cases are reported, the non-profit Garden
of Hope Foundation said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The estimate is based on the belief that sexual abuse cases tend to be under-
reported at a ratio of seven to one, said Chi Hui-jung, CEO of the foundation
dedicated to ending sexual abuse, sexual exploitation and domestic violence.</P>
      <P>Criminal Investigation  Bureau statistics  show that police received more than
3,000 reports of sexual assault in 2006 and more than 4,000 reports in 2007,
with 59 percent of the victims aged under 18.</P>
      <P>However, the number of sexual assaults reported to domestic violence and sexual
assault prevention centers around the country are markedly higher, with 4,900
cases reported in 2005, 2,786 of which involved a victim under 18. In 2006, the
total number increased to 5,638, of which 3,276 involved minors. The number was
even higher in 2007, with 3,727 of the total of 6,530 cases reported involving a
minor.</P>
      <P>The results of an online survey conducted July 24-29 and released Wednesday by
the foundation show that 87 percent of respondents had no idea that a child
sexual abuse case could be occurring as frequently as once every 27 minutes in
the country.</P>
      <P>The survey of 1,075 people aged 16 and older found that 76 percent of the
respondents said they would be willing to help sexually abused children, but
nearly 50 percent did not know who they can turn to or what services are
provided by the authorities.</P>
      <P>Approximately 70 percent of the respondents said they would tend not to
encourage sexually abused children to ask for help for fear that the children
might be hurt a second time in the process, while 50 percent of the respondents
said they would be concerned about washing dirty linen in public.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 35 percent of the respondents expressed doubt as to whether asking
the authorities for help would do any good.</P>
      <P>According to Chi, neglect of the problem by the public is a major barrier
impeding the victims' possible rehabilitation from their trauma.</P>
      <P>What makes matters worse is that victims have even less access to assistance in
the event of incest, she went on, noting that the number of survey respondents
supporting private mediation increased by 40 percent if the abuser is a member
of the family.</P>
      <P>Chi urged the public to pay attention to the victims' need for professional
counseling to help them overcome their trauma and to report cases of possible
child sexual abuse to the authorities.</P>

      <P>Vice President Vincent Siew said Wednesday that Taiwan should improve its export
structure and upgrade its economic quality if it wants to expand its economy
amid a global financial crisis and high consumer prices.</P>
      <P>Siew made the remarks while delivering a keynote speech at an economic forum
organized by a local think tank, the Chung-Hua Institution for Economic
Research, earlier in the day.</P>
      <P>Siew, a former chairman of the institution, said exports have been the driving
force for the country's economic growth over the past years.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's economic growth rate was 5.72 percent last year, the highest for the
past eight years, he said, adding that exports contributed 3.89 percentage
points to the country's economic growth, while domestic demand contributed 1.83
percentage points.</P>
      <P>However, a decline in the world economy due to the fallout from the U.S.
subprime mortgage crisis and high inflation has also had an impact on Taiwan's
economy, Siew observed.</P>
      <P>This July, Taiwan's export orders growth rate fell to 5.52 percent from the same
period of last year, the lowest since May 2003, when severe acute respiratory
syndrome hit Taiwan, he said.</P>
      <P>The growth rate in export orders from China also dropped to a new low of 1.73
percent, he continued.</P>
      <P>To boost the economy, Taiwan should not rely only on exports by the
manufacturing industry but should also focus on enhancing exports of the
country's services, he suggested.</P>
      <P>For example, he said, Hong Kong underwent an economic transition after it was
handed over from Britain to China in 1997, and its economy greatly improved
after Hong Kong inked a Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement (CEPA) with
China.</P>
      <P>Siew attributed the economic growth mainly to Hong Kong's focus on finance,
logistics, tourism and back-up services for industry and commerce.</P>
      <P>In addition, Taiwan needs to enhance the quality of its economy by easing
regulations, investing in human resources and improving infrastructure, he
pointed out.</P>
      <P>He added that Taiwan should also encourage private consumption, expand domestic
demand and capitalize on trade opportunities derived from the thawing relations
between Taiwan and China over the last three months.</P>
      <P>Taiwan opened up to greater numbers of Chinese tourists and to weekend direct
charter flights across the Taiwan Strait July 4 after the Kuomintang (KMT),
which favors closer trade ties with China, took the reins of government May 20.</P>

      <P>The Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) said Wednesday that nearly
2,000 tons of kitchen leftovers were picked up daily around the country in the
first half of the year.</P>
      <P>EPA officials noted that in the first six months, the average daily kitchen
leftovers collected reached 1,941 tons, among which, compostable kitchen
leftovers accounted for 24 percent, or 450 tons per day.</P>
      <P>The officials said that the amount means that the government will be able to
shelve plans to construct two more garbage incinerators.</P>
      <P>With the good results of the kitchen waste recycling program, the government
will continue to help local governments promote the collection of kitchen
leftovers, the officials went on.</P>
      <P>They touted the merits of recycled kitchen leftovers, pointing out that in

    <TEXT>
      <P>Far Eastern Group (FEG) -- one of Taiwan's largest business groups -- has become
embroiled in the high-profile money laundering scandal involving former
President Chen Shui-bian and his family after its chairman was accused of
bribing the family for business interests, making him one of the alleged donors
that allowed the Chens to amass their huge wealth.</P>
      <P>On Wednesday, FEG Chairman Douglas Hsu filed a lawsuit against Legislator Chiu
Yi of the ruling Kuomintang, political commentator Lee Sheng-feng and four
reporters working for Next Magazine, a weekly tabloid, on charges of defamation
after they publicly accused him of bribery.</P>
      <P>Hsu's lawyer Chiang Ju-jung told reporters that the accusations are false and
that their public comments  have harmed  Hsu's reputation.</P>
      <P>In addition to those lawsuits, Chiang said Hsu has also sued Chang Chi-ming,
general manager of Pacific Construction Co., for making a "groundless
accusation" against him.</P>
      <P>Chu Chao-liang, spokesman for the Special Investigation Division under the
Supreme Prosecutors Office, confirmed earlier in the day that the office had
received a tip-off by Chang, accusing Hsu of having donating some US$10 million
to Chen's wife, Wu Chu-jen, in 2004 in return for help in an FEG attempt to
acquire the right to take over a popular department store.</P>
      <P>The alleged donation was reportedly remitted to several of the Chen family's
overseas bank accounts suspected of containing a huge amount of money connected
to Chen's "state affairs fund" embezzlement case.</P>
      <P>Chen claimed Aug. 14 that all the money in the bank accounts is surplus funds
from election campaign contributions, all of which were handled by his wife.</P>
      <P>At a press conference following his filing of the legal actions, Hsu said his
move was aimed at defending the FEG's business reputation and the stockholders'
interests, as well as protecting his own name.</P>
      <P>The FEG, consisting of more than 180 affiliated companies, runs businesses that
cover the fields of petrochemicals and energy, textiles, cement and building
materials, retail and department stores, financial services, sea and land
transport, communications and the Internet, construction, and hotels.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A charity organization has set up Taiwan's first support center for family
caregivers to provide them with professional psychological counselling and
assistance in caregiving.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Association of Family Caregivers made the announcement at a news
conference Wednesday in which Wang Tsen-yung, president of the association, said
the center will provide counselling in a variety of aspects,  including
psychological  distress,  family relations, stress relief, adjustment to
lifestyle and emotional disturbance.</P>
      <P>All the counselling will be free, with the costs covered by profits of the
social welfare lottery, Wang said.</P>
      <P>Those who are no longer caregivers are also welcome to use the center's
resources, as they might need counselling on how to cope with grief over losing
a family member, Wang noted.</P>
      <P>Family caregivers are classified as people who take care of mentally or
physically disabled or senior family members who cannot take care of themselves
anymore.</P>
      <P>According to the association's statistics, Taiwan has about 580,000 people in
need of family caregiving, including 180,000 senior citizens and 400,000
mentally or physically disabled people.</P>
      <P>Wang said the traditional view of Taiwanese society takes responsibility for
taking care of disabled family members for granted but too often neglects family
caregivers' stress and the difficulties they face adjusting to their lives as
caregivers.</P>
      <P>Citing association statistics, Wang said 78 family caregivers have committed
suicide in the past two years and that 47 percent of them did so due to
psychological problems, while 31 percent killed themselves due to declining
health, Wang said.</P>
      <P>Many domestic  and foreign studies have shown that family caregivers have their
health and psychological condition undermined by their caregiving, and that most
of them suffer nervous breakdowns, Wang said, adding that local research shows
that 65 percent of caregivers have a tendency toward depression.</P>
      <P>Research conducted by the association last year found that 30 percent of the
respondents expressed the need for professional psychological counseling, while
26.7 percent just wanted somebody to listen to them.</P>
      <P>An association executive called on family caregivers not to bear their burden
alone and to call 0800-580-097 to reach the center for assistance.</P>
      <P>They can also visit the center on Chang An East Road in Taipei City to talk with
social workers or listen to music and relax a little, the executive said.</P>
      <P>The public should also give more care and support to those who take care of
disabled family members, the executive added.</P>

      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan Wednesday welcomed a massive investment plan by AU
Optronics Corp., the world's third-largest maker of liquid-crystal displays
(LCDs), to build four panel display plants in central Taiwan over the next 10
years.</P>
      <P>Liu welcomed the company's response to the government's i-Taiwan 12
infrastructure projects that are partly aimed at forming a new cluster of high-
tech industries in central Taiwan, to bring the area into better balance with
northern and southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Liu made the remarks in a statement issued after he had a one-hour meeting with
AU Optronics Chairman K.Y. Lee.</P>
      <P>The company plans to earmark NT$400 billion ($12.7 billion) over the next decade
to construct the plants in the central county of Changhua branch of the Central
Taiwan Science Park, the statement said.</P>
      <P>Construction of the first plant is slated to begin in the second half of next
year and to begin operations in 2011 or 2012, according to the statement.</P>
      <P>AU Optronics will employ more than 10,000 workers by the time the plants are
finished, the statement read.</P>
      <P>AU Optronics' investment plan follows a major investment plan recently unveiled
by Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., the world's largest contract maker of
consumer electronics.</P>
      <P>After a meeting with the premier early this month, Hon Hai Group Chairman Terry

    <HEADLINE>MOFA sees goodwill from China despite opposition to U.N. bid</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 27 (CNA)
08/27/08  22:17:06
(By Rachel Chan)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Wednesday that it sees some goodwill
from China in a letter from Beijing to the U.N. secretary-general regarding
Taiwan's latest proposal for participation in the world body, despite the fact
that Beijing's basic stance of opposing Taiwan's bid remains unchanged.</P>
      <P>"We are not too surprised by China's opposition, as its basic stance is the same
as before," MOFA spokesman Henry Chen told CNA.</P>
      <P>"But some goodwill can be seen, given the fact that China has said things it has
not mentioned before," he said.</P>
      <P>The U.N. posted Taiwan's proposal to participate in the world body along with a
letter written by Wang Guangya, U.N. permanent representative of the People's
Republic of China, on the Web site of the U.N. Journal, to be circulated among
member states.</P>
      <P>In the letter dated Aug. 18, Wang noted that relations between Taiwan and China
have shown "a good momentum of improvement and development" since March, thanks
to the concerted efforts of both sides of the Taiwan Strait, and that both sides
should continue to work on further peaceful development.</P>
      <P>"Under the new circumstances, we will firmly adhere to the theme of peaceful
development in cross-strait relations, and will continue to enhance our
exchanges and cooperation in all areas," Wang said.</P>
      <P>Admitting that there are still some outstanding questions left over from history
and that some of them are "hard nuts to crack for the time being, " Wang
contended that both Taipei and Beijing "will make joint efforts under the one
China principle  toward the establishment of a framework for peaceful
development of cross-strait relations and strive for new prospects in the
relationship."</P>
      <P>"We are fully confident that so long as the two sides work together in a spirit
of `building mutual trust, putting aside differences, seeking common ground and
striving for a win-win result, ' we will surely be able to create conditions and
find an appropriate solution through consultation," he said.</P>
      <P>However, Wang told the U.N. that by raising the so-called proposal on "Taiwan's
participation in the activities of U.N. specialized agencies," Nauru, the Gambia
and a few other countries that submitted the proposal on Taiwan's behalf, intend
to create "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan," which is firmly opposed by
the Chinese government and people because the U.N. and its specialized agencies
are intergovernmental organizations composed only of sovereign states and as a
part of China, Taiwan is not a sovereign state.</P>
      <P>He stated that as "an internal affair of the Chinese people," the participation
of Taiwan in international activities should be resolved through consultation
"by the Chinese people across the Taiwan Strait."</P>
      <P>In response to Wang's letter, the MOFA released a statement reiterating that the
basic rights of the people of the Republic of China to participate in
international organizations and activities should be respected.</P>
      <P>"The ministry thinks Taiwan's participation in the international community will
have positive effects on the consolidation of the peaceful development of cross-
strait relations, " the press release said.</P>
      <P>The Foreign Ministry disagreed with Wang, who claimed in his letter that Taiwan
has "unfettered access" to the health and medical information of the World
Health Organization (WHO) , as Beijing has signed a memorandum of understanding
(MOU) with the WHO Secretariat.</P>
      <P>"Under the terms of the MOU,  Taiwan  still cannot fully participate in WHO
conferences and activities, nor can it have direct contact and interaction with
the WHO, which leaves a gap between the reality and our expectations," the
statement said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan renewed its bid to enter the U.N. Aug. 14 by submitting a proposal to the
U.N. Secretariat through its allies calling for the world body to reconsider at
the Sept. 16 U.N. General Assembly the feasibility of Taiwan's meaningful
participation in U.N. specialized agencies.</P>
      <P>In an interview with CNA Tuesday, Foreign Minister Francisco H.L. Ou said that
the more moderate and pragmatic approach has received a very good response from
the international community and that he believes the bid will win more support
during the U.N. General Assembly.</P>
      <P>A senior Western diplomat in Taipei told CNA recently that he found Taiwan's
U.N. proposal to be "well thought-out" and "cleverly worded, " fully reflecting
the expectations of the international community and Taiwan's domestic situation.</P>
      <P>Since 1993, Taiwan's allies have been trying to put the issue of Taiwan's
participation on the agenda of the U.N. General Assembly on Taiwan's behalf, but
Beijing's argument that Taiwan is part of China has always prevailed.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's economy went into recession in July, with the monitor score dropping to
15, the lowest since June 2003, when the country was hit by an outbreak of
severe acute respiratory syndrome, according to a report released Wednesday by
the Council for Economic Development and Planning (CEPD).</P>
      <P>Economic indicators flashed a blue light signalling recession in July for the
first time since January 2007, while the composite index of leading indicators
-- a barometer for the economic outlook in the coming three months -- stood at
107.4, marking the ninth consecutive monthly drop, the report shows.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the composite index of coincident indicators, which reflects the
current economic situation, stood at 109.6, registering a drop of 0.7 percent
from the previous month.</P>
      <P>At a press conference, Hung Jui-bin, director-general of the CEPD's Economic
Research Department, attributed the recession to a variety of factors, including
the fact that the increased opening to Chinese tourists has attracted far fewer
visitors than expected, while domestic consumption has remained stagnant as a
result of the global economic slowdown.</P>
      <P>Hung admitted that Taiwan is in a challenging economic situation, with rising
commodity prices, dropping real incomes and weak domestic investment.</P>
      <P>However, the government's new measures aimed at boosting domestic demand are
expected to see good results by September, Hung said, noting that if the
measures work as well as hoped in pumping up civic investment in the fourth
quarter, the government will respond to the investment  with necessary
assistance  to help economic growth recovery.</P>

      <P>A group of 660 elderly veterans from Taiwan who endured the bombardment of the
island of Kinmen by China in 1958, returned to their old battlefields Wednesday
to reminisce about their experiences during the shelling and to honor those who
perished in the battle.</P>
      <P>The veterans, most of whom are in their 70s, arrived at the harbor in Liaolo Bay
aboard a naval supply ship from the southern Taiwan port of Kaohsiung. They were
originally scheduled to arrive in Kinmen Aug. 23 -- the anniversary of the start
of the bombardment -- but the trip was delayed because of rough seas.</P>
      <P>After receiving a warm welcome from their hosts, the military leaders and
soldiers of the Kinmen Defense Command, the veterans took part in a ceremony to
pay their respects to the war dead by laying wreaths at a public cemetery on
Dawu Mountain.</P>
      <P>Upon seeing that the island has evolved from a former battlefield into a
peaceful park, some of the veterans expressed hope that the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait will learn from history and never engage in war again.</P>
      <P>Kinmen is controlled and governed by Taiwan, although it lies closer to China's
Fujian Province than it does to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The 1958 artillery battle went on for 44 days, during which China tried but
failed to pound the small island into submission with 475,000 shells -- about
3,100 for every square kilometer of land.</P>
      <P>The bombardment resulted in some 3,000 civilian and 1,000 military causalities.
The army on Kinmen countered by firing back 128,000 shells into China.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Inattentiveness is more prevalent among local office workers than may have
previously  been imagined, according to the results of a survey released
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The online survey was conducted by a chewing gum company and 104 Job Bank from
Aug. 1-4 to explore local office workers' ability to concentrate on their work.
A total of 1,236 valid samples were collected, with a 95 percent confidence
level and a margin of error of 2.78 percent.</P>
      <P>The survey results show that 94 percent of the respondents confessed that they
were not attentive enough or did not concentrate enough while at work.</P>
      <P>Up to 78 percent said they were in good spirits for less than six hours during
each work day, while 33 percent said they could concentrate for less than four
hours at a time and around 44 percent said they were most prone to negligence
after lunch.</P>
      <P>The lack of concentration takes its toll on the quality of work produced, with
86 percent of the respondents saying they have made mistakes because of
inattentiveness  or lack of concentration, according to the survey.</P>
      <P>The most common errors cited in the poll were forgetting their bosses'
directives, failing to complete their day's work, dozing, inability to
concentrate during meetings and keying in incorrect figures, in that order.</P>
      <P>In the survey, more than 90 percent of corporte management staff said workers'
ability to concentrate on their work is a key factor in evaluation of their work
performance.</P>
      <P>Up to 88 percent of those surveyed said they believe that concentration will
boost work efficiency, and 63 percent said attentiveness will enable them to
better deal with their work.</P>
      <P>The survey further found that local office workers have many means to enhance
their concentration, including massage, exercise, stretching, doing only one
thing at a time, drinking tea or coffee, taking naps, chewing gum and listening
to music.</P>
      <P>An expert involved in the survey suggested that if an individual experiences
difficulty concentrating over the longer term, the person should consider the
possibility that it might be caused by a medical condition  and that they should
seek professional  advice and treatment.</P>
      <P>According  to a study by the International  Institute for Management Development
in Lausanne, Switzerland, each Taiwanese white-collar worker works up to 2,256
hours per year, or an average of nine hours each day, making it the world's
fifth longest.</P>
      <P>Analyzing the survey results, a 104 Job Bank manager said the long work hours of
local officer workers might be related with their inability to concentrate on
their work. NDITEM/J</P>

      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan Wednesday welcomed a massive investment plan by AU
Optronics Corp., the world's third-largest maker of liquid-crystal displays
(LCDs), to build four panel display plants in central Taiwan over the next 10
years.</P>
      <P>Liu welcomed the company's response to the government's i-Taiwan 12
infrastructure projects that are partly aimed at forming a new cluster of high-
tech industries in central Taiwan, to bring the area into better balance with
northern and southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Liu made the remarks in a statement issued after he had a one-hour meeting with
AU Optronics Chairman K.Y. Lee.</P>
      <P>The company plans to earmark NT$400 billion ($12.7 billion) over the next decade
to construct the plants in the central county of Changhua branch of the Central
Taiwan Science Park, the statement said.</P>
      <P>Construction of the first plant is slated to begin in the second half of next
year and to begin operations in 2011 or 2012, according to the statement.</P>
      <P>AU Optronics will employ more than 10,000 workers by the time the plants are
finished, the statement read.</P>
      <P>AU Optronics' investment plan follows a major investment plan recently unveiled
by Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., the world's largest contract maker of
consumer electronics.</P>
      <P>After a meeting with the premier early this month, Hon Hai Group Chairman Terry
Guo promised to expand the operations and R&amp;D of the company's headquarters

    <HEADLINE>MOFA sees goodwill from China despite opposition to U.N. bid</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 27 (CNA)
08/28/08  11:04:26
(By Rachel Chan)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Wednesday that it sees some goodwill
from China in a letter from Beijing to the U.N. secretary-general regarding
Taiwan's latest proposal for participation in the world body, despite the fact
that Beijing's basic stance of opposing Taiwan's bid remains unchanged.</P>
      <P>"We are not too surprised by China's opposition, as its basic stance is the same
as before," MOFA spokesman Henry Chen told CNA.</P>
      <P>"But some goodwill can be seen, given the fact that China has said things it has
not mentioned before," he said.</P>
      <P>The U.N. posted Taiwan's proposal to participate in the world body along with a
letter written by Wang Guangya, U.N. permanent representative of the People's
Republic of China, on the Web site of the U.N. Journal, to be circulated among
member states.</P>
      <P>In the letter dated Aug. 18, Wang noted that relations between Taiwan and China
have shown "a good momentum of improvement and development" since March, thanks
to the concerted efforts of both sides of the Taiwan Strait, and that both sides
should continue to work on further peaceful development.</P>
      <P>"Under the new circumstances, we will firmly adhere to the theme of peaceful
development in cross-strait relations, and will continue to enhance our
exchanges and cooperation in all areas," Wang said.</P>
      <P>Admitting that there are still some outstanding questions left over from history
and that some of them are "hard nuts to crack for the time being, " Wang
contended that both Taipei and Beijing "will make joint efforts under the one
China principle  toward the establishment of a framework for peaceful
development of cross-strait relations and strive for new prospects in the
relationship."</P>
      <P>"We are fully confident that so long as the two sides work together in a spirit
of `building mutual trust, putting aside differences, seeking common ground and
striving for a win-win result, ' we will surely be able to create conditions and
find an appropriate solution through consultation," he said.</P>
      <P>However, Wang told the U.N. that by raising the so-called proposal on "Taiwan's
participation in the activities of U.N. specialized agencies," Nauru, the Gambia
and a few other countries that submitted the proposal on Taiwan's behalf, intend
to create "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan," which is firmly opposed by
the Chinese government and people because the U.N. and its specialized agencies
are intergovernmental organizations composed only of sovereign states and as a
part of China, Taiwan is not a sovereign state.</P>
      <P>He stated that as "an internal affair of the Chinese people," the participation
of Taiwan in international activities should be resolved through consultation
"by the Chinese people across the Taiwan Strait."</P>
      <P>In response to Wang's letter, the MOFA released a statement reiterating that the
basic rights of the people of the Republic of China to participate in
international organizations and activities should be respected.</P>
      <P>"The ministry thinks Taiwan's participation in the international community will
have positive effects on the consolidation of the peaceful development of cross-
strait relations, " the press release said.</P>
      <P>The Foreign Ministry disagreed with Wang, who claimed in his letter that Taiwan
has "unfettered access" to the health and medical information of the World
Health Organization (WHO) , as Beijing has signed a memorandum of understanding
(MOU) with the WHO Secretariat.</P>
      <P>"Under the terms of the MOU,  Taiwan  still cannot fully participate in WHO
conferences and activities, nor can it have direct contact and interaction with
the WHO, which leaves a gap between the reality and our expectations," the
statement said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan renewed its bid to enter the U.N. Aug. 14 by submitting a proposal to the
U.N. Secretariat through its allies calling for the world body to reconsider at
the Sept. 16 U.N. General Assembly the feasibility of Taiwan's meaningful
participation in U.N. specialized agencies.</P>
      <P>In an interview with CNA Tuesday, Foreign Minister Francisco H.L. Ou said that
the more moderate and pragmatic approach has received a very good response from
the international community and that he believes the bid will win more support
during the U.N. General Assembly.</P>
      <P>A senior Western diplomat in Taipei told CNA recently that he found Taiwan's
U.N. proposal to be "well thought-out" and "cleverly worded, " fully reflecting
the expectations of the international community and Taiwan's domestic situation.</P>
      <P>Since 1993, Taiwan's allies have been trying to put the issue of Taiwan's
participation on the agenda of the U.N. General Assembly on Taiwan's behalf, but
Beijing's argument that Taiwan is part of China has always prevailed.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou expressed hope Wednesday that he will be able to visit
the Caribbean nation of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines to boost relations
between the two countries.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks during a meeting with Luis Straker, deputy prime minister
and foreign minister of the Caribbean ally, at the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and Saint Vincent have enjoyed diplomatic ties for more than 20 years, Ma
noted, expressing hope that Starker's visit will create more cooperation
opportunities for the two countries and further improve bilateral ties.</P>
      <P>Starker,  along with Glen Beached, Saint Vincent's tourism minister, also met
with Premier Liu Chao-shiuan that same day. Liu said the two countries not only
will strengthen relations but should also have more exchanges, especially in the
areas of tourism and education.</P>
      <P>Education played a crucial part in Taiwan's transformation to a technology-
oriented country from an agrarian one, Liu said, adding that education is worthy
of investment, although its effects might not be immediately apparent.</P>
      <P>He said the two countries should discuss cooperation in the two fields for the
benefit of both sides.</P>
      <P>Starker and Beached arrived in Taiwan a day earlier for a six-day visit.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan's economic growth suffers worst slowdown since 2003</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  27 (CNA)
08/28/08  11:06:53
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's economy went into recession in July, with the monitor score dropping to
15, the lowest since June 2003, when the country was hit by an outbreak of
severe acute respiratory syndrome, according to a report released Wednesday by
the Council for Economic Development and Planning (CEPD).</P>
      <P>Economic indicators flashed a blue light signalling recession in July for the
first time since January 2007, while the composite index of leading indicators
-- a barometer for the economic outlook in the coming three months -- stood at
107.4, marking the ninth consecutive monthly drop, the report shows.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the composite index of coincident indicators, which reflects the
current economic situation, stood at 109.6, registering a drop of 0.7 percent
from the previous month.</P>
      <P>At a press conference, Hung Jui-bin, director-general of the CEPD's Economic
Research Department, attributed the recession to a variety of factors, including
the fact that the increased opening to Chinese tourists has attracted far fewer
visitors than expected, while domestic consumption has remained stagnant as a
result of the global economic slowdown.</P>
      <P>Hung admitted that Taiwan is in a challenging economic situation, with rising
commodity prices, dropping real incomes and weak domestic investment.</P>
      <P>However, the government's new measures aimed at boosting domestic demand are
expected to see good results by September, Hung said, noting that if the
measures work as well as hoped in pumping up civic investment in the fourth
quarter, the government will respond to the investment  with necessary
assistance  to help economic growth recovery.</P>

unseen powers is felt -- sometimes above us, sometimes around us. Such is the
evidence of things invisible that it is impossible to doubt the spiritual nature
of man."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Yeh Sheng-mao, former chief of the Investigation Bureau under the Ministry of
Justice, was indicted for withholding information about ex-president Chen Shui-
bian's possible involvement in money laundering, a spokesman for the Taipei
District Prosecutors Office said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Lin Chin-chun said prosecutors are seeking a jail term of two years and six
months for Yeh, which is harsher than usual because the defendant is a
government official.</P>
      <P>Lin said Yeh, who stepped down from his post as chief of the Investigation
Bureau on July 16, withheld information about overseas bank accounts held in the
names of Chen Shui-bian's family members.</P>
      <P>Lin said Yeh was supposed to relay the information -- which the the bureau's
Anti-Money Laundering Center obtained on Jan. 27 from the global anti-money
laundering association Egmont Group -- to the Supreme Prosecutors' Office.</P>
      <P>However, the Supreme Prosecutors Office never received the information, Lin
added.</P>
      <P>The director of the Investigation Bureau's Anti-Money Laundering Center asked
Yeh about the information in March and was told that Yeh would hand it over to
Prosecutor General Chen Tsung-min in person, Lin related.</P>
      <P>Lin quoted the prosecutor general as saying that he never received the
information.</P>
      <P>Yeh later claimed that he had forgotten  to pass on the information to Chen
Tsung-min because the country was embroiled in a fiercely contested presidential
election at the time and he stepped down two months after the new administration
took office on May 20.</P>
      <P>Lin said a search of Yeh's home in Muza in Taipei on Aug. 21 yielded a photocopy
of the information from Egmont but not the original document.</P>
      <P>"The fact that Yeh carefully kept a photocopy of the information belies his
claim that he totally forgot about the whole matter, " Lin said.</P>
      <P>The news broke in late July after two Swiss prosecutors asked Taiwan authorities
for help in the investigation of a case of possible money laundering, which
involved a reported sum of US$21 million lodged in Swiss bank accounts under the
name of Chen Shui-bian's daughter-in-law.</P>
      <P>Lin indicated that it was not the first time Yeh, who was appointed in 2001 by
then-President Chen Shui-bian to head the Investigation Bureau, had withheld
information about the former first family.</P>
      <P>In 2006,  the Investigation  Bureau failed to pass on to prosecutors
information  it had obtained about possible money laundering by then first lady
Wu Shu-jen, Lin said.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, Yeh maintained that he had conveyed the information in 2006 to
then Prosecutor General Wu Ying-chao, a claim Wu denied.</P>
      <P>Regarding the more recent information from Egmont about the ex-first family's
bank accounts in Cayman Islands, many political observers have suggested that
Yeh gave Chen Shui-bian the original copy, which investigators have not yet
found.</P>
      <P>They have also urged the prosecutors to look into the possibility that Yeh may
have tipped off the ex-president about an imminent probe of his family's
overseas bank accounts.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan has no information on U.S. Harpoon missile sales: MND</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of National Defense (MND) has not received any information on the
possible sale of Harpoon Air-Launch missiles by the United States to Taiwan,
military spokeswoman Lisa Chi said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Chi was responding to a Reuters report published a day earlier, which stated
that the United States will sell 60 Harpoon Air-Launch missiles worth NT$90
billion to Taiwan. According to the report, the decision will end a freeze on
U.S. arms sales to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>However, Chi said the request to procure the Harpoon Air-Launch missiles from
the United States was put forward by the ROC Air Force last year and Taiwan does
not expect a positive response until 2009.</P>
      <P>"We have not received any formal notification from the U.S.</P>
      <P>side," Chi said.</P>
      <P>The Bush administration is still sitting on US$11 billion worth of additional
weaponry requested by Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The list of military hardware reportedly being held up includes anti-tank
missiles,  Apache helicopters,  Patriot PAC-3 missile batteries, diesel-powered
submarines, P3C anti-submarine aircraft and sea-launch Harpoon missiles.</P>
      <P>Taiwan fears that if the notifications are not sent to the U.S. Congress a month
before it adjourns in late September, approval of the sale will be pushed back
to 2009 under a new U.S. administration.</P>
      <P>Responding to speculations surrounding the delay in processing the deal, the
U.S. Department of State reiterated last month that Washington has not changed
its policy on arms sales to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said July 18 that the administration
"faithfully implements the Taiwan Relations Act" and that there is an "internal

    <TEXT>
      <P>Another case of indigenous dengue fever has been confirmed, bringing the number
of confirmed cases in the capital city to 20, the Taipei City Department of
Health reported Thursday.</P>
      <P>The latest case was a 47-year-old woman from the Yonglun Borough in Taipei
City's northern Shilin District, according to the municipal Department of
Health.</P>
      <P>The department has been stepping up measures to prevent dengue fever, following
the confirmation of five indigenous cases in Shilin District recently.</P>
      <P>The city government has dispatched mosquito eradication units to spray indoor
and outdoor areas within 200 meters of buildings where dengue fever cases were
reported, and to spray 10 boroughs near the Shilin area.</P>
      <P>In the northeastern Songshan District, blood samples of 215 residents have been
collected for testing. Of the total, 211 samples were confirmed as negative,
while four were inconclusive, according to the department.</P>
      <P>Dengue fever is transmitted to humans by infected Aedes albo pictus mosquitoes,
which mainly breed in stagnant water.</P>
      <P>Department officials therefore urged residents in Taipei City to step up efforts
to clean up environmental black spots and to get rid of standing water in
containers such as flower pots, buckets and discarded tires.</P>
      <P>People who develop early symptoms of dengue fever, such as fever, joint pains
and skin rashes, should immediately seek medical attention, the department
advised.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Thursday that the United States
never had any preordination regarding Taiwans participation in international
organizations, rebutting media reports that the U.S. hoped that Taiwan, in its
talks with Beijing, will not give any impression that China has sovereignty over
Taiwan nor that China should be the one to have the final say.</P>
      <P>Through our continuous contact and communication with the U.S. government, the
U.S. has expressed great appreciation for the proposal regarding Taiwans
meaningful participation in the U.N. specialized agencies, MOFA spokesman Henry
Chen said at a regular press briefing in response to a reporters question.</P>
      <P>The U.S. never had any preordination (regarding Taiwans U.N. bid), the report is
totally untrue,he added.</P>
      <P>The local newspaper Liberty Times reported Thursday that on President Ma Ying-
jeous pro-China stance and his recent moderate approach in pitching Taiwans
participation in the United Nations, the U.S. expressed its position by saying
that in the talks with Beijing, Taiwan should not imply that China has
sovereignty over Taiwan and that China should not be the one to determine
whether Taiwan can participate in international activities.</P>
      <P>The message was delivered to Ma by American Institute in Taiwan Chairman Raymond
Burghardt during Mas transit stops in the U.S. en route to South America and the
Caribbean Aug. 12-19, the report added.</P>
      <P>The frosty relations between Taiwan and China have been thawing since Ma took
office May 20, with his proposal for adiplomatic truceandmodus vivendi, aimed at
terminating the longstanding diplomatic tug-of-war with China and winning more
international space for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Asked if Taiwan's new diplomatic initiative was not favorably received by China
given the fact that Aug. 18 China reiterated its opposition to Taiwans U.N.
proposal, Chen said the ministry is not surprised, as it is the same basic
Chinese stance as before, but stressed that Taiwan will continue to push the
bid.</P>
      <P>Diplomatic ties with our allies are the most important indicator of diplomatic
truce while participation in international organizations is the long-term goal
that the ministry will continue to work on,Chen said, urging China to
demonstrate more goodwill on the issue of ending the competition to lure each
othersdiplomatic allies.</P>
      <P>Taiwan renewed its bid to enter the U.N. Aug. 14 by submitting a proposal asking
the U.N. General Assembly at its Sep. 16 meeting to reconsider the feasibility
of Taiwans meaningful participation in the U.N. specialized agencies. However,
Chinese Ambassador to the U.N. Wang Guangya wrote to the U.N. secretary-general
Aug. 18, saying that China opposes Taiwans bid because as part of China, Taiwan
is not a sovereign state that can participate in the U.N. specialized agencies,
which are composed only of sovereign states.</P>
      <P>In response to Wangs letter, MOFA released a statement Wednesday reiterating
that the basic rights of the people of the Republic of China to participate in
international organizations and activities should be respected.</P>
      <P>Asked if the MOFAs response wastoo weak, Chen rebutted the accusation, saying
that the ministry was simply responding to the facts of the issue.</P>
      <P>One should not draw the conclusion thatthis is the endfrom a single incident, as
participation in international organizations is our long-term goal,Chen said.</P>
      <P>He stressed that the pragmatic and meaningful proposal has won an overwhelmingly
positive  response  from  the international community, including the U.S., Japan
and many important European countries.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Lawmaker calls for stiffer penalties on personal data leaks</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A lawmaker has called for stiffer punishments for public and private
organizations that leak local citizens' information to fraud rings after the
police busted the country's largest personal data theft case earlier this week.</P>
      <P>The ruling and opposition political parties should soon reach an agreement on a
draft amendment to the Computer Processed Personal Data Protection Act,
opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Legislator Wong Chin-chu said in a
news release Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Under the amendment, the total compensation amount offered by government
agencies and companies to individuals for failing to protect their personal data
would be increased to NT$50 million (US$1.6 million) from the current NT$20
million, Wong said.</P>
      <P>In addition, agency or company employees who sell personal data will face five
year prison terms, rather than the current two year terms, Wong said.</P>
      <P>Even those who leak personal data for motives other than profit will no longer
be free of punishment, but will face sentences of two years or less, she noted.</P>
      <P>Wong said that leaking personal data to fraud rings has seriously breached
personal privacy and has a serious impact on social order.</P>
      <P>Wong recalled that earlier this year, a local textbook publisher allegedly
leaked the personal data of 310,000 national high school exam takers.</P>
      <P>Moreover, she added that on Tuesday, the Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB)
busted a ring that stole more than 50 million pieces of personal data from
government agencies and telecom companies.</P>
      <P>The police found that Chinese hackers also were involved in the case and have
requested the assistance of Chinese police through a joint crime-combating
channel between Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>The police began investigating the ring after state-run Chunghwa Post Co.
reported last April that a group of hackers stole more than NT$3 million from
the savings of postal company's clients.</P>
      <P>The police later discovered that the ring hacked into the databases of the
Bureau of National Health Insurance, the Ministry of Education and local telecom
companies.</P>
      <P>The ring collected the information and set up a database containing the
information on government officials, business people and the general public, the
police disclosed.</P>
      <P>The police said that they arrested  the main suspect,  a 32-year-old with the
surname Chen, and five other accomplices on Tuesday in Taipei City and Taipei
County in northern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The suspects also sold the data to other rings for NT$300 per inquiry on each
piece of personal data, the police said.</P>
      <P>Employees and dealers in the telecom companies have been found to have
collaborated with the ring, the police revealed, adding that they are still
searching for other accomplices.</P>

      <P>Police in central and southern Taiwan on Wednesday arrested five suspects who
allegedly smuggled stolen heavy motorbikes from Japan and made an illegal profit
of more than NT$50 million (about US$1.6 million) from the sale of the bikes.</P>
      <P>The arrests ware made as a result of collaboration with Japanese police and the
International Criminal Police Organization, police in Taiwan said.</P>
      <P>Japanese police also nabbed two Taiwanese suspects at Tokyo Narita International
Airport on Aug. 11 in connection with the same scam, Taiwan police said.</P>
      <P>Local police caught other suspects in the case in the central city of Taichung
and southern city and county of Kaohsiung. The suspects confessed that they had
smuggled stolen motorbikes from Japan on four occasions, bringing dozens of
bikes each time.</P>
      <P>The police said that they found 14 stolen large-engine bikes, some of which were
reported in Japan as stolen between 2002 and early this year.</P>
      <P>The evidence indicates that Japan-based Taiwanese expatriates and Japanese

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government has come up with eight economic stimulus measures,  including
offering subsidies  and preferential taxes to enterprises and individuals, in an
effort to boost private investment and consumption.</P>
      <P>The measures were unveiled Wednesday at a Cabinet meeting chaired by Vice
Premier Chiu Cheng-hsiung, Minister without Portfolio Chen Tain-jy said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Chen said that although the recent fall of international oil prices has helped
to ease domestic inflationary pressure, the country faces yet another challenge:
slower exports amid a global econmic downtown.</P>
      <P>For this reason, the government decided to shift its economic policy from
battling inflationary pressure to expanding domestic investment and consumption
to stimulate the sagging economy, he added.</P>
      <P>According to Minister without Portfolio Chu Yun-peng, one of the main stimulus
measures is the launch of a short-term preferential tax system for enterprises.
Currently, the government offers tax cuts or tax exemptions to specific
industries, such as high technology companies, on the basis of the Statute for
Upgrading Industries which will expire at the end of next year.</P>
      <P>Chu said that before the statute expires, the government will introduce an
amendment that will include a provision for other businesses, such as
manufacturing and service industries, to be given preferential tax treatment on
a short-term basis. The draft amendment is scheduled to be proposed in
September, Chu disclosed.</P>
      <P>The government also plans to raise the cap on construction and home loans. Under
the existing Banking Law, the total value of bank loans for the purpose of
constructing residential or commercial buildings may not exceed 30 percent of
the lending institution's balance of time deposits. Chu said that the government
plans to finalize the details concerning that stimulus measure within one month.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chu noted that several preferential home loan programs launched by
the Ministry of the Interior have not proved effective, given that private
banks, with an eye to attracting clients, have launched many more similar
programs in response. Thus, the government is considering raising preferential
interest rates for home loans, although the details have not yet been finalized,
he said.</P>
      <P>Other measures include allocating NT$13.5 billion to provide subsidies  to
450,000 employees living near the poverty line; assisting  local  governments
to  more  effectively  implement infrastructure projects; offering subsidies to
the disadvantaged and expanding and promoting trade and investment.</P>

      <P>Their first ever visit to Taiwan may be short, but four former NBA stars will be
left with indelible beautiful memories of the country, according to L. A. Lakers
shooter Glen Rice Thursday.</P>
      <P>"It's all about people -- we love them, and they love us, " said Rice,
reflecting on what he saw as the best part of their experience in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Six-time NBA championship winner, Batman Scottie Pippen, however, was more taken
with Taipei's "karaoke" culture, disclosing that he had already twice tried the
unique social activity in Taipei and "drank a lot."</P>
      <P>The four basketball players engaged in their first exercise in Taiwan Thursday
morning -- following their arrival in the country earlier this week -- though
not on the familiar basketball court, but at the Ta Shee Golf and Country Club.</P>
      <P>Pippen, a former Chicago Bulls forward who is also a big golf fan, jokingly told
the CNA reporter that his level of golf is probably the same as that of world
No. 1 player, Tiger Woods, or "maybe better."</P>
      <P>But he declined to reveal how good he really is, opting to keep his handicap a
secret. And there was still no telling when the four players finished 18 holes
in the scorching sun, as no official scores were kept.</P>
      <P>Both Pippen and Rice said that they were having a great time on their first
visit to Taiwan, and that they were overwhelmed by the hospitality and
enthusiasm of the Taiwan people. In reciprocation, the U.S. baseball ambassadors
reached out to the local people and basketball fans without any airs.</P>
      <P>Rice said modestly while they are in the country to offer some advice on
basketball, they also want to hear something from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Pippen and Rice, along with Clyde Drexler of the Rockets and B.J. Armstrong of
the Bulls, are in Taipei on the 2008 NBA Madness Taiwan Tour, which will feature
two exhibition matches in Taipei and Hsinchu County Friday and Saturday,
respectively.</P>

      <P>Pro-independence Taiwan Society reiterated Thursday that the Aug. 30 rally is
not an event to support ex-president Chen Shui-bian, who is embroiled in a
money-laundering scandal with his family members, but rather an outcry from the
people to safeguard the sovereignty of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"This event is not about whether one supports the Kuomintang (KMT) or the
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), " said Wu Shuh-min, president of Taiwan
Society, in a press conference to announce the Aug. 30 "Outcry from the People"
march and rally for foreign journalists stationed in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"The Ma Ying-jeou administration, which is desperate to make progress on cross-
strait issues, has yielded too much to Beijing, " he stated.</P>
      <P>The frosty relations between Taiwan and China have been thawing since Ma took
office May 20, with the launch of direct weekend charter flights and the
allowance of more Chinese tourists to visit Taiwan, as well as the relaxation of
investment restrictions in China. Ma also proposed a "diplomatic truce" and
"modus vivendi" aimed at terminating the longstanding diplomatic tug-of-war with
China.</P>
      <P>"Unilateral concession on the part of the Kuomintang government has received
very little positive response from China, " Wu said. "What is worse is that Ma's
concessions have been made at the expense of Taiwan's sovereignty and security."</P>
      <P>He therefore urged that people should speak out their deepest feelings to Ma,
including protecting Taiwan's sovereignty, improving the economy for a better
life and swiftly enacting sunshine laws.</P>
      <P>Refusing to comment on Chen's calling on those who support him to participate in
the march, Lo Chih-cheng, secretary-general of Taiwan Society, said that he
believes that people will join the rally because they believe in the three
demands, among which safeguarding Taiwan's sovereignty is the most important
message the group wants to send out to the world.</P>
      <P>Chen admitted Aug. 14 that he had lied about the campaign expenses for his two
mayoral elections  and two presidential elections between 1993 and 2004 and that
his wife had wired surplus campaign contributions into overseas bank accounts
held by members of his family. Chen and his family, who were prohibited from
leaving the country by prosecutors, are currently being investigated.</P>
      <P>"Over the past three months, Ma's policies have taken Taiwan in the opposite
direction from before and betrayed our traditional allies such as the United
States and Japan, " Lo said.</P>
      <P>The group also demanded a formal apology from Ma for failing to deliver his
campaign promises of six percent economic growth, three percent unemployment,
and US$30,000 GDP per capita.</P>
      <P>"We criticize, as most people do, because we see the nation moving in a
dangerous direction, but so far none of our words are accepted by the
government, " said Winston Yu, vice president of Taiwan Society. "Ma makes no
confession of his mistakes, no apology. He even ridiculously fought back by
calling those who criticize him 'cynical'."</P>
      <P>Participants at the press conference unanimously called for early passage of
more "Sunshine bills" to combat corruption by public functionaries. The
enactment of such laws will oblige senior officials and civil servants to
account for their private assets.</P>
      <P>Lo said at least 22,500 people from central and south Taiwan have signed up to
join the Aug. 30 rally and he expected that many more from Taipei city will
participate in the event.</P>

      <P>Presidential Office spokesman Wang Yu-chi would not comment Thursday on a daily
news' speculation regarding ruling Kuomintang (KMT) Vice Chairman John Kuan's
possible nomination to head the Examination Yuan.</P>
      <P>Wang said the new legislative session would not begin until mid-September and
that the Presidential Office will submit the nomination for new Examination Yuan
presidency for legislative confirmation by then.</P>
      <P>According to a United Daily News (UDN) report, President Ma Ying-jeou is likely
to nominate Kuan, 68, who served as vice president of the Examination Yuan
between 1996-2000, to head the Examination Yuan after Chang Chun-yen, former
president of National Chiao Tung University, withdrew from screening after he
was nominated Examination Yuan president by Ma in June.</P>
      <P>Chang withdrew for personal  reasons only days before the Legislative Yuan was
supposed to review and approve Ma's Examination Yuan nominees June 23 to allow
those selected to bring new prospects for the Examination Yuan, which is in
charge of recruiting and managing the country's civil servants.</P>
      <P>The legislature reviewed and approved the list of the other 20 nominees,
including Wu Chin-lin, then a KMT deputy secretary-general, who was nominated by
Ma to serve as vice president of the Examination Yuan, and 19 others to serve as
Examination Yuan members.</P>
      <P>UDN speculated  that  if nominated  and approved  by the legislature, Kuan would
resign his post as a KMT vice chairman and quit all KMT activities  to "champion
the neutrality  as an administrator."</P>
      <P>Kuan's alleged nomination drew mixed reaction by the ruling KMT and opposition
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Thursday.</P>
      <P>Ker Chien-ming, a DPP legislative caucus whip, said Ma had promised during his
campaign that if elected he will nominate non-KMT people to head the Examination
Yuan and the top watchdog agency, the Control Yuan.</P>
      <P>"Is Ma going to eat his own words or something now by appointing a hardcore KMT
member to head the Examination Yuan?" Ker said.</P>
      <P>"Kuan's nomination will receive zero votes from DPP legislators if Ma indeed
does so, " a determined Ker claimed, adding that the KMT is only aimed at
misusing the mammoth budget the Examination Yuan controls for public
functionaries' retirement payments.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Chu Feng-chih, however, has completely different views on Kuan's
possible nomination, saying that Kuan would make a good Exmaination Yuan
president, not just because he is very familiar with the operations of the
organization, but also because of his professional abilities and morality.</P>
      <P>"Kuan is a man of integrity with strength of character who would be an impartial
and capable leader if authorized to head the Examination Yuan," Chu added.</P>
      <P>Also welcoming Kuan's possible nomination as Examination Yuan president, KMT
Chairman Wu Poh-hsiung said he would respect the president's decision.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Subsidy for households near poverty line to be issued from October</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  28 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government will issue a temporary subsidy of up to NT$6,000 (US$190) per
month to households living near the poverty line starting in October, in an
effort to help the disadvantaged cope with inflation, the Cabinet announced
Thursday.</P>
      <P>The program will run through March 2009, benefiting an estimated 450,000
households  that are not receiving any aid from the government at present,
according to the Ministry of the Interior (MOI).</P>
      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan said the program has been worked out to complement  the
existing social aid network that covers only low-income households at the lowest
end of the income distribution graph, but fails to cover those living near the
poverty line.</P>
      <P>According to Liu, a high employment rate -- averaging 4.26 percent during the
2000-2007 period -- has fueled the country's widening wealth disparity, with the
number of low-income earners having increased by 640,000 over the past 10 years,
including a large number who sank from the middle-class.</P>
      <P>"These citizens living near poverty, who cannot afford to save any money, suffer
an especially great impact from the ongoing inflation, particularly in food and
oil prices, " Liu said during a weekly Cabinet meeting.</P>
      <P>Interior Minister Liao Liao-yi said after the program expires in March next
year, the govenrment will review the country's economic situation to decide
whether to extend it for another six months.</P>
      <P>The program will target citizens aged 20-65 who are the main income earners of
their families and who make no more than NT$300,000 per year.</P>
      <P>Other requirements that the subsidy applicants must meet are: they are not from
a low-income household; they are full-time workers; their spouses or immediate
dependents under 65 earn no more than NT$300,000 per year; the combined income
of the applicants, their spouses and immediate dependents under 65 did not reach
the minimum threshold for paying income tax in the most recent fiscal year; and
the total value of real estate owned by the applicants, their spouses and
immediate dependents under 65 does not exceed NT$3.9 million.</P>
      <P>Liao said the applicants will be grouped in five brackets according to the
average annual income of the applicants and their spouses.</P>
      <P>The subsidized amount will be NT$6,000 for those receiving an average annual
income below NT$140,000; NT$5,000 for those in the NT$140,000-NT$180,000
bracket;  NT$4,000  for  those  in  the NT$180,000-NT$220,000  bracket;
NT$3,500  for  those  in  the NT$220,000-NT$260,000 bracket;  and NT$3,000 for
those in the NT$260,000-NT$300,000 bracket, Liao said.</P>
      <P>For individuals with no dependants, the subsidized amount will be NT$3,500 if
they earn less than NT$220,000 per year, and NT$3,000 if they make between
NT$220,000 and NT$250,000 per year, he said.</P>
      <P>MOI officials said potential  subsidy recipients  will be shortlisted via
computer-aided screening of the government's income tax returns database, after
which they will receive an application form and be asked to sign it to declare
they truly meet all the requirements listed above.</P>
      <P>Liao pointed out that the screening may inaptly include some people who live
comfortably but file only a small amount in their income tax returns, and he
urged community officials to help exclude this group of people.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ITRI invents multi-viewer auto-stereoscopic display technology</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Aug.  28  (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Industrial Technology Research Institute  (ITRI)  has  developed  technology
that  allows auto-stereoscopic display for multiple viewing, sources at the
Hsinchu-based institute announced Thursday.</P>
      <P>Stereoscopic display is a method that enables viewers to see stereoscopic
images; however, such a display requires the viewer to wear special goggles or
glasses to see the images properly. Auto- stereoscopic displays create a
stereoscopic effect that the viewer can perceive without glasses, but the
existing technology allows only one person to see the image at a time.</P>
      <P>The ITRI researchers who developed the technology said the conventional  auto-
stereoscopic  display devices have a limited viewable angle of 5 degrees, which
limits the total viewership. "The new technology widens the viewable angle up to
60 degrees, allowing multiple individuals to view the images simultaneously,"
they said.</P>
      <P>The researchers estimated that a commercial multi-person auto- stereoscopic
display will cost about NT$60,000 (US$1,900)  to NT$80,000 for a 42-inch TV
screen, while an auto-stereoscopic set of the same screen size usually costs up
to NT$139,566 on the European market.</P>
      <P>The research group said that a couple of private companies have already
contacted the ITRI to discuss cooperation in technology transfer, and that
commercial versions will enter the market in two to three years.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The director of the Taipei Zoo said Thursday that the zoo management has no
immediate plans to bring in more koala bears from their native Australia,
although the zoo has lost two of its seven koala bears in 40 days.</P>
      <P>Jason Yeh told reporters that the zoo will not consider bringing in additional
koalas because  the Australian  government  has temporarily suspended the export
of wild koalas and because the zoo is now busy preparing for the arrival of two
giant pandas from China.</P>
      <P>Two female koalas -- Ligi and Eve, both 11 years old -- died of malignant tumors
July 18 and Aug. 27, respectively.</P>
      <P>The zoo still has one female koala, named Pearl, and four male koalas: Patrick,
Milk Tea, Qubi and Qudi. Pearl and Milk Tea were given by Australia to the
Taipei Zoo in 2004, while Qubi and Qudi were born in captivity in 2003 and 2005,
respectively, as offspring of Patrick and Ligi, who was sent to the zoo by an
Australian sanctuary in 2001, according to Yeh.</P>
      <P>In an unprecedented so-called "wedding ceremony" attended by 500 well-wishers in
Taipei in October 2001,  then-Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou and Gary Balidon,  mayor
of Australia's Gold Coast, "married" Ligi to Patrick and Eve to Harley.</P>
      <P>In 2004, the zoo euthanized Harley after a malignant tumor was found in his
nose.</P>
      <P>Yeh said that zoo keepers are anxious to find out within the next few days if an
Aug. 3 mating between Pearl and Milk Tea will produce an offspring. Koala
gestation is about 30 days.</P>
      <P>The zoo's koalas are a children's favorite because of their cute and cuddly
appeal.</P>
      <P>Although koalas are not endangered, the Australian federal government strictly
controls exports of live animals. At present, only a few zoos outside Australia
-- in the United States, Japan, Germany and Taiwan -- have the marsupials.</P>
      <P>According to the Australian Koala Foundation, the number of wild koalas in
Australia is estimated at between between 40,000 and 80,000.</P>

academic  information  exchange, publication of collaborative  research
achievements  and joint participation in academic symposiums and activities.</P>
      <P>The two schools will also set up a dual degree program in which students
pursuing a master's or doctoral degree in one of the schools can also obtain an
equivalent degree from the other school after having gained the necessary
credits in both schools.</P>
      <P>According to the MOU, NTOU will help cultivate talent for Taiwanese and

    <TEXT>
      <P>Nearly 80 percent of the respondents to a recent poll said they use private
transport to get to and from work and 57 percent said there is a lack of public
transport near their homes, according to the results of the online survey
released Thursday by the Consumers' Foundation.</P>
      <P>The survey, aimed at exploring consumers' use of public transport and their
satisfaction regarding public transport and commuting fares, ran from the
beginning of July to Aug. 25, with 3,295 valid replies collected, said a
foundation official.</P>
      <P>According to the survey results, 78 percent of the respondents use private
transport when commuting, followed by 17 percent who commute via public
transport and 3 percent who use both, while 2 percent of the respondents said
they walk to work.</P>
      <P>The results also indicate that 57 percent of the respondents feel that public
transport near their homes is inadequate, with 22 percent saying there are not
enough public transport vehicles and 14 percent complaining of too few stops,
especially in rural areas.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 35 percent of the respondents said they have to walk for 5 to 10
minutes to reach the closest bus stop to their home, followed by 21 percent who
have a 20-minute walk and 14 percent who have a 30-minute walk, which reduces
their willingness to commute via public transport.</P>
      <P>With regard to fares, respondents that use both public and private transport
said they spend an average of NT$2,782 (US$88.40) commuting per month,
accounting for 7.5 percent of their monthly incomes, the highest in the survey.</P>
      <P>Those who commute via private transport spend NT$1,971 per month (6.2 percent of
their monthly income) , while respondents using only public transport spend
NT$1,703 per month, representing 6.1 percent of their monthly income, the lowest
in the survey.</P>
      <P>The Consumers' Foundation said the government should adopt energy-saving
transport policies to improve the traffic situation, reduce air pollution and
promote the use of public transport.</P>

      <P>Chiayi Mayor Huang Ming-hui has invited visitors from Taiwan and abroad to take
part in the Double Ten National Day celebrations in the southern city,  as the
city government is preparing a series of festivities for the Oct. 10-12 weekend
holiday.</P>
      <P>Huang told reporters Thursday that the city government has already selected a
location -- a farm belonging to the Chiayi Agricultural Station, which is
adjacent to Chiayi Park -- for the official Oct. 10 fireworks display.</P>
      <P>A giant red balloon with a diameter of five meters is now tethered 100 meters
above the farm as a reference to inform the public where they can see the
fireworks.</P>
      <P>The mayor urged the public to find a good spot in advance for watching the
fireworks. "If you can see the balloon, then you will be able to see the Double
Ten fireworks," she said.</P>
      <P>This will be the first official National Day fireworks show to be staged in
Chiayi by the central government. The show is considered a major event, as the

      <P>A majority of Taiwanese citizens who responded to a recent poll think Taiwan
should first discuss economic exchanges with China in cross-Taiwan Strait
negotiations before moving on to political issues, according to the poll results
released Thursday.</P>
      <P>The poll, authorized by the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC), found
that 73 percent of the respondents feel the two sides of the strait should
tackle issues related to economic exchanges first and leave political issues for
discussion at a later date.</P>
      <P>The poll, conducted by telephone Aug. 22-24, found that 52.2 percent of the
respondents think cross-strait relations are now much more eased than they were
a year ago, and 50.6 percent said they are confident in the Ma Ying-jeou
administration's ability to maintain cross-strait peace and stability.</P>
      <P>A total of 51.8 percent of the respondents said they support the
administration's policy of relaxing restrictions on cross-strait business and
investment exchanges,  but 65.5 percent said the government should have tighter
standards in terms of the management of such exchanges, the poll found.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the findings, MAC spokesman Liu Te-shun said most of the
respondents are positive toward the government's relaxed economic policy toward
China, but apparently they also hope the government will come up with well-
designed coping measures to prevent undesired scenarios.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 51.6 percent of the respondents said that "securing equality and
dignity" for Taiwan in cross-strait negotiations is as important as "achieving
substantive interests."</P>
      <P>However, 53.1 percent of the respondents said Beijing is not friendly toward the
Ma administration, while 45.1 percent said Beijing is not friendly toward the
people of Taiwan either, Liu said.</P>
      <P>He called for the Chinese authorities to understand that despite thawing cross-
strait relations, the people of Taiwan are still skeptical toward political
interaction across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>"China should not constrain Taiwan's political maneuvering space in the
international community," Liu added.</P>
      <P>The poll of adults randomly selected nationwide obtained 1,094 valid responses,

      <P>A group of 20 indigenous young men and women selected from colleges and
universities around the country left for Hawaii Thursday on a 12-day exchange
visit, the Council of Indigenous Peoples (CIP) announced that day.</P>
      <P>Wang Chiu-yi, director of the CIP's Department of Education and Culture, said
the students are the "cream of the young indigenous elite" because they were
selected after passing a host of challenging tests, including tests of their
various mother tongues, a verbal English language test and a written test of
aboriginal cultures and knowledge.</P>
      <P>"The visit to Hawaii is aimed at honing their abilities in exchanges with
indigenous peoples from around the world," Wang said.</P>
      <P>According to CIP Minister Chang Jen-hsiang, the administration has planned to
inject some NT$10 billion (US$322.58 million) over four years to improve
infrastructure development in aboriginal communities and narrow the gap between
aboriginal communities and Taiwan's mainstream society.</P>
      <P>In addition to international exchange activities, the CIP has also sought
financial subsidies from the government to enable 10 outstanding indigenous
students to seek advanced studies abroad each year to help raise aboriginal
peoples' social status through education, Chang noted.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of the Interior (MOI) announced  a draft bill Thursday on the
prevention  of human trafficking.</P>
      <P>"The  legislation  will  facilitate  a crackdown  on human trafficking, better
protect the rights of the victims in the human trade and improve Taiwan's
international image, " the ministry said in a press statement.</P>
      <P>The draft  bill  clearly  defines  what constitutes  human trafficking,
including recruitment, transportation, harboring of people for the purposes of
slavery, forced labor and servitude. According to the bill, those convicted of
being involved in human trafficking  operations  should be given the severest
possible penalties in accordance with the law.</P>
      <P>For instance, those who are convicted of forced labor, including bonded labor or
debt bondage, should be given a maximum seven-year prison sentence plus a fine
of no more than NT$3 million. An even longer prison term should be given to any
public servant found guilty of covering up such criminal acts.</P>
      <P>An official of the MOI's National Immigration Agency (NIA) said the harsher
punitive measures are designed as a deterrent.</P>
      <P>The draft bill also outlines the powers and duties of government agencies in
charge of combating human trafficking, as well as protective and sheltering
measures for victims in human trafficking cases.</P>
      <P>Noting that human trafficking has emerged as a crucial challenge faced by the
international community in the era of globalization, the NIA official said
Taiwan is one of the major countries to have seen an influx of migrant workers
and marriage immigrants from Southeast Asia.</P>
      <P>"Against this backdrop, Taiwan has become a popular destination for criminal
rings engaged in the human trade or trafficking in recent years, tarnishing
Taiwan's international image and affecting Taiwan's public order and human
rights records," said the official.</P>
      <P>To cope with the situation, the official went on, the government decided to
enact a new set of regulations to facilitate its fight against human
trafficking.</P>
      <P>Since July 2007, he continued, the MOI and the NIA have convened many rounds of
cross-department meetings to draft the bill, which will be sent to the Executive
Yuan for further review before being referred to the Legislative Yuan for
priority screening and approval.</P>
      <P>"It is hoped that the bill can clear the legislative floor during the
legislative session that will begin in mid-September, " the official said.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou reiterated Thursday his hope that the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait can stop competing to lure each other's allies with offers of cash
aid -- so-called "checkbook diplomacy."</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks at a meeting at the Presidential Office with John Perry,
chairman of the Ireland-Taiwan Parliamentary Friendship Society.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that all European countries, except for the Vatican, have
diplomatic relations with China, while the Holy See is Taiwan's only European
ally.</P>
      <P>Due to concern over the tension between Taiwan and China, European countries
tend to be cautious about developing further relations with Taiwan, even though
the country has set up economic and cultural offices in most European countries,
Ma said.</P>
      <P>He explained that under the notion of seeking a "diplomatic truce" with China,
Taiwan will strive to strengthen relations with Ireland but will not seek full
diplomatic ties.</P>
      <P>This will give Ireland more space in developing relations with both Taiwan and
China at the same time without the concern that would otherwise be caused, Ma
said.</P>
      <P>Ma told Perry that during a trip he made to Ireland two years ago, he learned
that the country's rapid development was closely related to its pragmatic and
flexible policies.</P>
      <P>Ma said his efforts to cement relations with China since assuming office are
aimed at seeking an end to the "vicious competition" in the diplomatic field,
giving Taiwan more international space for development.</P>
      <P>He expressed hope that Perry and other friends in Ireland will help introduce
his idea of the "diplomatic truce" to more people when dealing with related

      <P>CAA Director-General Lee Lung-wen told reporters that eight weeks after Taipei
and Beijing began to allow cross-strait charter flights on weekends, the average
passenger occupancy rate for the six Chinese carriers operating the routes
reached a record 92.5 percent last weekend, up 5.2 percent from the previous
weekend, surpassing for the first time the average occupancy rate of the five
Taiwanese airlines plying the routes, recorded last week at 91.6 percent</P>
      <P>Lee said the carriers have proposed that the scope of the cross-strait air
services be expanded by allowing them to increase the number of flights from the
current ceiling of 36 and to add new routes and destinations.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan will ask that the proposal be included on the agenda for the next round
of cross-strait talks and will not rule out the possibility of discussing the
opening of regular flights between the two sides," he added.</P>
      <P>Lee also said that because most airline companies  flying cross-strait charter
flights on weekends have expressed hope that they will be allowed to carry some
cargo for additional revenue, the Taiwanese delegation will also raise this
issue in the next round of dialogue.</P>
      <P>The five Taiwanese carriers operating cross-strait  charter flights are China

    <HEADLINE>MOI unveils draft bill on combating human trafficking</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  28  (CNA)

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of the Interior (MOI) announced  a draft bill Thursday on the
prevention  of human trafficking.</P>
      <P>"The  legislation  will  facilitate  a crackdown  on human trafficking, better
protect the rights of the victims in the human trade and improve Taiwan's
international image, " the ministry said in a press statement.</P>
      <P>The draft  bill  clearly  defines  what constitutes  human trafficking,
including recruitment, transportation, harboring of people for the purposes of
slavery, forced labor and servitude. According to the bill, those convicted of
being involved in human trafficking  operations  should be given the severest
possible penalties in accordance with the law.</P>
      <P>For instance, those who are convicted of forced labor, including bonded labor or
debt bondage, should be given a maximum seven-year prison sentence plus a fine
of no more than NT$3 million. An even longer prison term should be given to any
public servant found guilty of covering up such criminal acts.</P>
      <P>An official of the MOI's National Immigration Agency (NIA) said the harsher
punitive measures are designed as a deterrent.</P>
      <P>The draft bill also outlines the powers and duties of government agencies in
charge of combating human trafficking, as well as protective and sheltering
measures for victims in human trafficking cases.</P>
      <P>Noting that human trafficking has emerged as a crucial challenge faced by the
international community in the era of globalization, the NIA official said
Taiwan is one of the major countries to have seen an influx of migrant workers
and marriage immigrants from Southeast Asia.</P>
      <P>"Against this backdrop, Taiwan has become a popular destination for criminal
rings engaged in the human trade or trafficking in recent years, tarnishing
Taiwan's international image and affecting Taiwan's public order and human
rights records," said the official.</P>
      <P>To cope with the situation, the official went on, the government decided to
enact a new set of regulations to facilitate its fight against human
trafficking.</P>
      <P>Since July 2007, he continued, the MOI and the NIA have convened many rounds of
cross-department meetings to draft the bill, which will be sent to the Executive
Yuan for further review before being referred to the Legislative Yuan for
priority screening and approval.</P>
      <P>"It is hoped that the bill can clear the legislative floor during the
legislative session that will begin in mid-September, " the official said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>President reiterates `diplomatic truce' with China idea</HEADLINE>

(By Ruth Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou reiterated Thursday his hope that the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait can stop competing to lure each other's allies with offers of cash
aid -- so-called "checkbook diplomacy."</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks at a meeting at the Presidential Office with John Perry,
chairman of the Ireland-Taiwan Parliamentary Friendship Society.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that all European countries, except for the Vatican, have
diplomatic relations with China, while the Holy See is Taiwan's only European
ally.</P>
      <P>Due to concern over the tension between Taiwan and China, European countries
tend to be cautious about developing further relations with Taiwan, even though
the country has set up economic and cultural offices in most European countries,
Ma said.</P>
      <P>He explained that under the notion of seeking a "diplomatic truce" with China,
Taiwan will strive to strengthen relations with Ireland but will not seek full
diplomatic ties.</P>
      <P>This will give Ireland more space in developing relations with both Taiwan and
China at the same time without the concern that would otherwise be caused, Ma
said.</P>
      <P>Ma told Perry that during a trip he made to Ireland two years ago, he learned
that the country's rapid development was closely related to its pragmatic and
flexible policies.</P>
      <P>Ma said his efforts to cement relations with China since assuming office are
aimed at seeking an end to the "vicious competition" in the diplomatic field,
giving Taiwan more international space for development.</P>
      <P>He expressed hope that Perry and other friends in Ireland will help introduce
his idea of the "diplomatic truce" to more people when dealing with related
issues.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Airlines on both sides of the Taiwan Strait saw record passenger volumes on
their cross-Taiwan Strait charter flights last weekend, with the average
occupancy rate reaching 92 percent, breaking the 90 percent mark for the first
time, the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) announced Thursday.</P>
      <P>CAA Director-General Lee Lung-wen told reporters that eight weeks after Taipei
and Beijing began to allow cross-strait charter flights on weekends, the average
passenger occupancy rate for the six Chinese carriers operating the routes
reached a record 92.5 percent last weekend, up 5.2 percent from the previous
weekend, surpassing for the first time the average occupancy rate of the five
Taiwanese airlines plying the routes, recorded last week at 91.6 percent</P>
      <P>Lee said the carriers have proposed that the scope of the cross-strait air
services be expanded by allowing them to increase the number of flights from the
current ceiling of 36 and to add new routes and destinations.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan will ask that the proposal be included on the agenda for the next round
of cross-strait talks and will not rule out the possibility of discussing the
opening of regular flights between the two sides," he added.</P>
      <P>Lee also said that because most airline companies  flying cross-strait charter
flights on weekends have expressed hope that they will be allowed to carry some
cargo for additional revenue, the Taiwanese delegation will also raise this
issue in the next round of dialogue.</P>
      <P>The five Taiwanese carriers operating cross-strait  charter flights are China
Airlines, EVA Airways, Mandarin Airlines, TransAsia Airways and Uni Air, while
the six Chinese companies are China Eastern Airlines, Shanghai Airlines, China
Southern Airlines, Xiamen Airlines, Hainan Airlines and Air China.</P>

      <P>Vice President Vincent Siew said Thursday that he looks forward to an early
realization of moves to turn Taiwan into not just an island of prosperity but
also an island of arts and culture.</P>
      <P>Siew revealed his vision at a welcome reception for foreign participants in "Art
Taipei 2008, " an art trade fair, on the eve of the inauguration of the annual
event.</P>
      <P>Noting that artworks tend to become an important line of trade when national
economic development reaches a certain stage of maturity, Siew said he keenly
hopes the Art Taipei exposition can help make Taipei an important arts trading
center in Asia and help upgrade Taiwan's "soft power."</P>
      <P>"Art Taipei, " organized by the Council for Cultural Affairs and the Art
Galleries Association of ROC, provides a platform for artists from home and
abroad to showcase their creative works.</P>
      <P>For the first time this year, a new section will be created for promising local
young artists to exhibit their brainchildren, calling it "Made in Taiwan - Young
Artist Discovery." Eight finalists were selected from 108 young hopefuls to join
the exhibition.</P>
      <P>A total of 63 local art galleries and 48 ones from the United States, France,
Spain, the Netherlands, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, China and Hong Kong are

    <HEADLINE>'Tempo' of cross-strait exchanges could be improved: MAC head</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Aug. 28 (CNA)
08/29/08  13:34:41

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's top China policy planner said Thursday that she does not think Taiwan
has been engaging with China over the past three months at too rapid a pace,
although she added that the "tempo" of the engagement could be improved.</P>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairwoman Lai Shin-yuan, who is visiting
Washington, D.C. in a bid to publicize Taiwan's stance on the development of
cross-Taiwan Strait relations, explained that finding a "better tempo" means
allowing the people to better understand what the government is doing and to
what purpose in its efforts with regard to cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>She explained that many policies that have been criticized by the opposition
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) as "too rash" are in fact issues that were
discussed by negotiators across the Taiwan Strait during the previous DPP
administration,  with consensus actually reached on some of the issues.</P>
      <P>These issues include the institutionalization of cross-strait negotiations,
allowing Chinese tourists to enter Taiwan, exchanges of charter cargo flights
and direct cross-strait shipping links, she noted.</P>
      <P>As a matter of fact, she went on, some economic and trade measures, such as
lifting the ceiling on Taiwan investment in China, were agreed upon two-
and-a-half years ago.</P>
      <P>"Those measures were not implemented due to Taiwan's elections and other
political reasons," she explained.</P>
      <P>Lai said of her visit to the U.S. capital that visiting in person contributes to
increasing friendship and trust -- two elements she said are desperately needed
in U.S.-Taiwan relations.</P>
      <P>Noting that she has helped handle many cases related to the United States when
she worked in the DPP administration prior to 2004, Lai said she feels sad that
U.S.-Taiwan relations have taken such a downward turn over the past eight years
under DPP rule.</P>
      <P>"It is crucially important that the new administration under the leadership of
President Ma Ying-jeou is resolved to rebuilding mutual trust with the United
States," she said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Price floor for rice exports to ensure domestic supplies: official</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  29 (CNA)
08/29/08  13:52:25
(By Ruth Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Council of Agriculture (COA) official reiterated Thursday that minimum price
restrictions on rice exports will help reduce export volume and ensure
sufficient domestic supplies.</P>
      <P>COA Chairman Chen Wu-hsiung made the remarks to explain a decision taken by the
COA in April to impose a price floor of US$1,200 per ton for exported rice.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese rice has gained more opportunities for export recently due to its
relatively stable prices compared with international rice price hikes, according
to Yu Sheng-feng, deputy director-general of the COA's Agriculture and Food
Agency.</P>
      <P>Yu noted that Taiwan exported 6,634 tons of rice during the January-June period,
more than 20 times the amount exported during the whole of last year.</P>
      <P>Under the price floor restrictions, the only export destinations will be
countries with high consumption ability and the ability to pay, such as Japan,
Chen said.</P>
      <P>The government has also taken measures to increase domestic rice production,
Chen went on.</P>
      <P>Policies aimed at revitalizing 60,000 hectares of fallow land and increasing
rice coverage by 20,000 hectares are expected to increase the national rice
reserves from this year's 300,000 tons to 400,000 tons in 2009, Chen said.</P>

      <P>With the new school year set to begin Sept. 1, a doctor at Chi Mei Medical
Center offered tips Friday to parents on how to help their children avoid "back-
to-school" syndrome.</P>
      <P>Lin Chien-he, a doctor at the Tainan-based medical center's psychiatry
department, said that symptoms of the syndrome include lack of energy, sore
muscles, rapid heartbeat, general tiredness and upset stomach.</P>
      <P>There are two main reasons why a student might experience the syndrome, Lin
continued -- difficulty adapting to a new environment and difficulty getting out
of "holiday mode" in terms of habits and routines.</P>
      <P>Those most at risk of falling victim are new students and students who are
starting classes at a new school, according to Lin.</P>
      <P>Lin suggested that parents can do several things to guide their children as the
new term approaches to ease the transition and prevent them from being
afflicted.</P>
      <P>These include gradually reducing the number of hours their children watch
television and surf the Internet, slowly adjusting their sleep hours, and
spending some time with their kids to discuss their plans in the coming days in
order to prepare them for the daily school routine and reduce the stress of
making the transition back to class, Lin explained.</P>
      <P>"Being well-prepared is the most effective way of avoiding back-to-school
syndrome," she added.</P>
      <P>Lin also noted that exercise is the best method of helping a person adjust to a
new situation, adding that it is also helpful for students in making the
adjustment back to regular sleeping hours ahead of the start of the new school
year.</P>

      <P>Chen Chun-ying, a sister-in-law of former President Chen Shui-bian's wife Wu
Shu-jen, was subpoenaed again Friday for questioning as a witness over her
possible role in a suspected overseas money laundering case involving the former
first family.</P>
      <P>The Special Investigation Division under the Supreme Prosecutors Office said
Chen Chun-ying was summoned again as a witness mainly so prosecutors could gain
a better understanding of how and when Wu remitted huge amounts of money to ABN
AMRO Bank and Standard Bank of South Africa branches in Singapore.</P>
      <P>Chen Chun-ying and her husband, Wu Ching-mao, who is the elder brother of the
former first lady, were summoned for questioning Aug. 18, but Chen appeared to
faint during questioning and was rushed to the nearby National Taiwan University
Hospital for emergency treatment.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors thus decided to subpoena her again Friday for further
questioning.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Special Investigation Division also summoned other friends and
relatives of Wu Shu-jen to find out whether they were also used by the former
first lady as figureheads to facilitate money laundering via overseas bank
accounts.</P>
      <P>The former  first couple  and their  son Chen Chih-chung, daughter-in-law Huang
Jui-ching and Wu Ching-mao were listed last week as suspects in the case and
banned from leaving the country.</P>
      <P>During questioning by prosecutors last Friday, the former first lady argued that
the US$21 million in overseas bank accounts under the name of her elder brother
and daughter-in-law were surplus funds from political contributions for the
campaigns of her husband in two mayoral elections and two presidential elections
from 1993 to 2004.</P>
      <P>During questioning Aug. 25, Huang Jui-ching said she was used as a figurehead by
her mother-in-law to open overseas bank accounts to facilitate cash deposits.</P>

      <P>Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin met with former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani at the
latter's security consulting business in New York Thursday to exchange municipal
administrative experiences.</P>
      <P>During their nearly one-hour meeting, they discussed a wide range of issues,
focusing primarily on crimefighting and municipal social welfare projects.</P>
      <P>Giuliani, who served as mayor between 1994-2001, is widely lauded for his
success in reducing the amount of crime in New York during his time in office.</P>
      <P>He rose to international  prominence for his inspirational handling of the
aftermath of the 911 terrorist attack on the World Trade Center in 2001 and was
named Time magazine's "Person of the Year" for that year.</P>
      <P>Giuliani went on to run for the Republican Party's nomination for the 2008
presidential election and led in national polls for most of 2007 until his
campaign faltered.</P>
      <P>At Thursday's  meeting,  the former mayor praised Taiwan's democracy and asked
Hau several questions on the current cross-Taiwan Strait situation.</P>
      <P>Hau explained recent developments in cross-strait  affairs, including an accord
between the two sides on launching cross-strait weekend charter flights and
opening Taiwan to more Chinese tourists from early July.</P>
      <P>Hau arrived in New York Aug. 26 at the head of a delegation of city government
officials and councilors for a five-day visit aimed at learning from the U.S.
city's experience in waterfront urban development and municipal administration.</P>
      <P>The delegation includes Taipei City Deputy Secretary-General Chen Yung-jen;
Department of Urban Development Commissioner Ting Yu-chun; Emile C.J. Sheng,
head of the city's Research, Development and Evaluation Commission; and city
councilor Chiang Nai-shin.</P>
      <P>Hau's itinerary includes meetings with New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, as well

airlines what routes they should fly, pointing out that this is entirely up to
the market to decide.</P>
      <P>However, Chen claimed that the issue is not just about market forces, that
negotiations on flight rights cannot just be handled by local governments, and
that the Mainland Affairs Council should intervene.</P>
      <P>According to the agreement on opening Taiwan to more Chinese tourists, which was
signed at the same time as the weekend charter flights accord, a maximum of
3,000 Chinese citizens can visit Taiwan for sightseeing purposes per day.</P>
      <P>Chen said that since early July, the actual number of Chinese tourists has been
far lower than the allowed limit and she urged Ma to keep his campaign promise
to help boost southern Taiwan's economy by bringing in more Chinese tourists
rather than just asking local governments to work harder to attract more
tourists.</P>

    <HEADLINE>No Taiwan stores haved applied for crab imports from China: DOH</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>No discount chain stores or seafood companies have yet filed for permits for the
import of hairy crabs from China so far this year, the Cabinet-level Department
of Health (DOH) reported Friday.</P>
      <P>As the high season for hairy crabs from China -- also known as Dazha crabs,
which are considered a delicacy -- is approaching, importers should have started
preparing for paperwork, including import permits and quarantine documents, to
pave the way for their imports, said Hsieh Ting-hung, deputy director of the DOH
Bureau of Food Safety.</P>
      <P>No Chinese hairy crabs were imported via legal channels last year as the Chinese
authorities would not issue safety documents for China's hairy crab exports to
Taiwan, according to Hsieh.</P>
      <P>After traces of cancer-causing substances were detected in crabs imported from
China in 2006, the DOH began in 2007 to impose stricter entry screening measures
for such imports -- measures including that official quarantine certificates
must be issued by Chinese authorites to prove that hairy crabs supplied by the
42 officially-recognized Dazha crab farms in China are safe to eat, and that
imports should cease if residues of cancer-causing substances are detected in
three batches of crabs.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said Taiwan will maintain the same import screening standards this year to
oversee the safety of imported crabs.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's new construction head proposed during his swearing-in speech Friday
that mass transport and bicycles should be prioritized before private vehicles
in future urban planning decisions.</P>
      <P>Yeh Shih-wen was sworn in by Interior Minister Liao Liou-yi as director-general
of the Construction and Planning Agency under the Ministry of the Interioir. Yeh
is aformer deputy director-general of the ministry's Architecture and Building
Research Institute.</P>
      <P>Taking Taipei City as an example, Yeh said future road design schemes should
consider scaling down car lanes to make room for parking areas and turning
existing parking areas into bike lanes or pedestrian walkways.</P>
      <P>Yeh emphasized that the controversial idea is only his personal view and the
agency would have to review related regulations and communicate with the
relevant authorities and local governments before anything more concrete could
be proposed.</P>
      <P>He expressed hope that the current road planning, which is done primarily with
private cars as the major focus, will be changed in the future.</P>
      <P>Yeh gave the example of London to better illustrate his thoughts. In preparation
for the 2012 Olympic Games, Yeh said, the city has reduced the number of car
lanes from four to two to make room for bikes and pedestrians and stipulates
that private cars have to carry four people to be allowed on roads in certain
areas, with a fee that must be paid to enter certain areas by car.</P>
      <P>Road design should provide comfortable space for bike users so that more people
will be encouraged to cycle to contribute to energy saving, said Yeh.</P>
      <P>In addition, he went on, shower facilities in office buildings would allow bike
riders who have sweated all the way to the office to start work dry and clean.</P>
      <P>The agency will consider including shower facilities in office building as part
of the "green architecture index" in the future, and will also communicate with

    <HEADLINE>Tainan County fighting to protect lagoon from environmental damage</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>08/29/08  18:44:49</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A beach cleaning drive in which 120 volunteers worked to clear trash from a
sandbank in the Chiku lagoon in the southern county of Tainan Aug. 24 has
highlighted the environmental threat to the area.</P>
      <P>The volunteers, mobilized by the Taipei-based Good Neighbor Foundation, engaged
in two hours of training before taking boats to the sandbank to clear trash in
scorching-hot weather, in the hope of restoring the lagoon's pristine beauty.</P>
      <P>The lagoon, Taiwan's largest, is located in the county's Chiku township on the
west coast of the island, and is bounded by four offshore sandbanks, covering
1,600 hectares.</P>
      <P>"The volume of garbage on the sandbank was far greater than I had imagined, and
I was surprised to discover, based on our analysis of the trash, that a lot of
it had washed up there from other countries," said a volunteer known by the last
name Huang.</P>
      <P>The lagoon and its sandbanks, which serve as a natural barrier along the
county's coastline and helps prevent flooding during heavy rains, host many
wetland species such as crabs, oysters, and clams, and are also the winter
habitat of the migratory black-faced spoonbill.</P>
      <P>"It was heartbreaking to see such a beautiful sandbank covered with Styrofoam,
all kinds of bottles and other trash, " said Lai Tung-ming, president of the
foundation.</P>
      <P>According to Chen Kun-ho, director of Chiku township's coastal protection
association, manmade pollution in the area is not just an environmental problem.</P>
      <P>"It also impacts on nearly 6,000 local fishermen's means of livelihood, Chen
said.</P>
      <P>The lagoon wetlands, abounding with flora and fauna, have been a lifeline for
local residents for hundreds of years, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Pollution is not the only threat to the wetlands. According to Chen, the
shrinking of the sandbanks further overshadows the future of the lagoon's
topography.</P>
      <P>Forces of nature like wind erosion and rains brought by tropical storms are the
main cause of the shrinking sandbanks, Chen said, adding that tropical storms
have tended to be stronger in recent years because of dramatic global climate
changes.</P>
      <P>In an attempt to prevent erosion of the sand by northeastern winds, the
volunteers in the beach cleaning drive built a bamboo fence along the sandbank.</P>
      <P>The county government's efforts to save the lagoon's resources and topography
have been in effect for many years, according to Tainan County Magistrate Su
Huan-chih.</P>
      <P>Su said he prevented industrialization of the area 10 years ago when he was a
legislator and that the county government, over the past decade, has been trying
to preserve the lagoon's ecological resources by protecting the wetland species
and migratory birds.</P>
      <P>The county government also launched an annual tourism and ecology promotion
activity in summer 1997 to introduce the lagoon's diverse ecology to the public
in the hope of attracting more support for its preservation efforts.</P>
      <P>People were invited to wade into the shallows to collect clams and to engage in
water sports such as pedal boating and canoeing.</P>
      <P>This year, the county government extended the activity for an additional two
weeks because its popularity exceeded expectations, Su said.</P>
      <P>The efforts of the county government to protect the lagoon has yielded some
encouraging results, but the road ahead is still a long one, Su said.</P>
      <P>"Our challenge over the next 10 years will be how to save the shrinking
sandbanks and prevent the topography from disappearing, " he added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A senior European Union lawmaker expressed full support for Taiwan's bid to join
the United Nations' specialized agencies this year and urged the European
Parliament to show goodwill toward the new bid, a Brussels-based magazine said
in a report Thursday.</P>
      <P>Center-right parliamentarian Georg Jarzembowski, chairman of the parliament's
Taiwan Friendship Group, was quoted by the Parliament Magazine on its Web site
as saying he "fully endorsed" Taiwan's new move.</P>
      <P>"It is a perfectly reasonable and well-founded request and the very least China
can do. After the success of the Olympics, it would represent an appropriate
goodwill gesture on the part of Beijing, " he said.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that Taiwan's inclusion in such organizations is vitally important
not just for Taiwan but for the rest of the world, Jarzembowski said that
Taiwan's exclusion from the WHO has been detrimental to the health rights of the
23 million people of Taiwan and foreigners residing in and traveling to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The World Health Organization (WHO) , the International Civil Aviation
Organization  (ICAO)  and the International  Maritime Organization (IMO) are
among the 16 U.N. specialized bodies that Taiwan cites in its latest bid for
meaningful participation in U.N. activities.</P>
      <P>Taiwan failed in its previous annual bids over the past 15 years to seek full
membership in the world body due to obstruction by China. China claims
sovereignty over self-ruled Taiwan and vows war if necessary.</P>
      <P>This year, Taiwan's Kuomintang (KMT) government, which took office on May 20 and
favors closer ties with China, changed its strategy to focus on meaningful
participation in one or more of the U.N. specialized agencies.</P>
      <P>Two of Taiwan' 23 diplomatic allies -- St. Vincent and the Solomon Islands --
submit Taiwan's bid proposal to the U.N. Secretariat on Aug. 15.</P>
      <P>The report also quoted Edward McMillan-Scott, a vice president of the European
Parliament, the EU's legislative arm, as saying that "I still think Taiwan
should push for full membership of the U.N."</P>
      <P>Taiwan's new bid is widely seen as a crucial test to see if China accepts
Taiwan's President Ma Ying-jeou's olive branch to have a diplomatic truce with
Beijing.</P>
      <P>Chinese Ambassador to the U.N. Wang Guangya, however, has already blasted
Taiwan's diplomatic allies for striving to put Taiwan's U.N. participation bid
on the agenda for the 2008 General Assembly session slated to open Sept. 16. in
New York.</P>
      <P>"As a part of China, Taiwan is not a sovereign state," Wang said in a letter
dated Aug. 18 to U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.</P>
      <P>"The claim by a very few countries that specialized agencies should allow the
Taiwan region to 'participate' in their activities under the 'principle of
universality' is unfounded," he added.</P>
      <P>On Thursday, Presidential Office Spokesman Wang Yu-chi described Wang's remarks
as "an accidental situation, " which he said could not be directly interpreted
as "no goodwill."</P>
      <P>The government will not change its course on the diplomatic truce with China and
will continue to push for Taiwan's participation in the international community,
he pointed out.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's Air Force has significantly raised the combat readiness of its Mirage
2000-5 jet fighters, with the average mission capable rate rising to nearly 70
percent from last year's 54 percent, an Air Force general said Friday.</P>
      <P>Briefing journalists invited to the Hsinchu Air Base in northern Taiwan to watch
an air maneuver by Mirage fighters, Maj. Gen. Wang Hsuan-chou, commander of the
499th Wing of the Republic of China Air Force, attributed the improved readiness
of the aircraft to an increased government budget for Air Force maintenance and
supply.</P>
      <P>The mission capable rate is used to identify the percentage of aircraft able to
perform their missions. It is one of the indicators of combat readiness.</P>
      <P>Taiwan bought 60 Mirage 2000-5s -- 48 single-seaters and 12 two-seaters -- for
its Air Force from France in the late 1990s, but lost three two-seaters and one
single-seater in recent years during routine training flights.</P>
      <P>In 2007, the mission capable rates of the Mirage jet fighters dropped to 54
percent for the single-seaters and 75 percent for the two-seaters, mainly
because insufficient budget appropriations in 2005 and 2006 created difficulties
in acquiring parts needed for the maintenance of the fighters, according to
Wang.</P>
      <P>He expressed confidence that as the maintenance budget for next year has been
increased, the mission capable rate of the Mirage fighters will be maintained at
least at this year's level.</P>

      <P>Republic of China Representative to the Netherlands Larry Yu-yuan Wang will
replace Tou Chou-sheng as the country's ambassador to the Holy See, according to
a statement released by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) Thursday.</P>
      <P>MOFA Spokesman Henry Chen said Tou will retire after having served in the post
for four years and eight months.</P>
      <P>Tou will step down formally Sept. 15, Chen added, noting that the Holy See has
approved Wang's succession.</P>
      <P>The Holy See is the only country in Europe that maintains diplomatic ties with
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In a CNA report from Rome, the outgoing ambassador described the ROC-Vatican
relations as stable, saying the Holy See has always opened doors for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Tou also said that the Vatican regards the ROC as one of its best partners in
international humanitarian relief programs because Taiwan has always been among
the nations that first answered the Pope's call for aid to suffering people.</P>
      <P>Although it has been the Vatican's  basic policy to seek normalization of its
relationship with Beijing, the Vatican will not act to pursue the ties until
freedom of religion is allowed in China, Tou said. He stressed that the Holy See
cares about the religious life and safety of believers in underground Catholic
churches in China.</P>
      <P>The Holy See will not tolerate Beijing's continued efforts to suppress
underground churches and punish their members, as well as Beijing's attempts to
organize a church that does not follow the Holy See's leadership, Tou said.</P>
      <P>Tou, born in 1942, is the ROC's 12th ambassador to the Holy See. Before his
appointment, he served in various MOFA departments and as ambassador to Senegal,
which severed diplomatic ties with Taiwan in 2005. He also once served as vice
minister of foreign affairs.</P>
      <P>According to MOFA, 61-year-old Wang has served in the MOFA departments of North
American affairs and protocol, and the Taipei Economic and Cultural

      <P>Taiwan could collaborate with other countries in the area of world heritage
preservation  through non-government organizations even though the country lacks
membership of the United  Nations  Educational,  Scientific  and Cultural
Organization (UNESCO), a visiting UNESCO official said in a recent lecture in
Taipei.</P>
      <P>According to the World Heritage nomination  process,  only countries that have
signed the World Heritage Convention can submit nomination proposals for sites
on their territories to be included on UNESCO's World Heritage List.</P>
      <P>"But this does not mean you are out of the world, " said Dieter Offenhausser,
deputy secretary-general and spokesman of UNESCO's German Commission during the
lecture held Thursday at the German Cultural Center in Taipei.</P>
      <P>He encouraged Taiwan to work with non-government organizations (NGOs) in the
field, such as the International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS) , an
organization that aims to conserve historic monuments around the world. The CCA
has been an ICOMOS member since 2003.</P>
      <P>Taiwan would be able to draw up its own national heritage list and discuss it
with international experts through cooperation of this type, he went on.</P>
      <P>In 2003, the CCA listed 12 cultural and natural sites around Taiwan that have
potential to be designated as world heritage sites.</P>
      <P>These sites include the Taroko National Park in eastern Taiwan, renowned for its
magnificent gorge, and the Yushan National Park in central Taiwan, which
features Mount Jade, the highest peak in Northeast Asia.</P>
      <P>The CCA also established the Administration of Cultural Heritage last year as
part of its efforts to protect Taiwan's heritage and raise public awareness of
the country's historical assets.</P>
      <P>Besides domestic efforts, Taiwan has taken part since 2005 in a plan to restore
La Antigua, an ancient city designated as a world heritage site in Guatemala,
one of the 23 countries with which Taiwan has diplomatic relations.</P>
      <P>In his lecture,  Offenhausser noted that in recent years, transboundary
applications filed jointly by either two or three countries tend to have been
more easily approved by the World Heritage Committe.</P>
      <P>Asked if it would be possible for Taiwan to submit a joint world heritage site
nomination proposal with other countries, Offenhausser only replied that the
UNESCO accepted transboudary  nomination proposals among its members states.</P>
      <P>He gave as an example the Frontiers of the Roman Empire, which was added to the
World Heritage List in 1987 as the result of a collaboration between Germany and
Britain.</P>
      <P>To date, the UNESCO World Heritage List includes 878 sites, covering 679
cultural, 174 natural and 25 mixed ones, considered by the World Heritage

    <HEADLINE>First indigenous measles case reported this year</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) announced Friday Taiwan's first case of
indigenous measles this year, saying that the patient was a 10-month old baby
girl who had been infected by a family member who recently returned from an
overseas trip.</P>
      <P>Chou Jih-haw, deputy director general of DOH's Centers for Disease Control, said
that the 25-year-old male family member, from northern Taiwan, had visited
Thailand for business between July 26 and July 30. After his return,  he sought
medical treatment, complaining of muscle pains, and was diagnosed with
tonsillitis, Chou related.</P>
      <P>Shortly after the man returned home, he developed a skin rash and a fever --
typical symptoms of measles. As the symptoms persisted, he was forced to check
into a hospital, which confirmed that he had measles -- the sixth imported case
this year, according to Chou.</P>
      <P>Chou said that six adults and two children -- a three-year-old and the 10-month-
old baby girl -- live with the man.</P>
      <P>A check of the family found that, to date, only the baby girl has contracted
measles. On Aug 19. she was found to have a skin rash, fever, cough, inertia and
was vomiting, he disclosed.</P>
      <P>The MMR vaccine against measles, mumps and rubella is still "the most effective
way to prevent measles," Chou said.</P>
      <P>Children should be given the first dose at between 12 months and 15 months, and
the second dose in the first grade of elementary school, he advised.</P>
      <P>"Overall, the MMR inoculation rate is as high as 95 percent," he said, noting
that indigenous cases of measles have been rare in Taiwan in recent years.</P>
      <P>People who wish to travel to China, Southeast Asia, Japan or Europe, where there
are currently risk of measles outbreak, can pay to have the measles vaccine if
they are not sure whether or not they have immunity or if they wish to take
children under one year of age there, he suggested.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's top China policy coordinator said here Thursday that one of the major
objectives of her trip to the United States is to convey President Ma Ying-
jeou's determination to expand Taiwan's international space.</P>
      <P>Lai Shin-yuan, chairwoman of the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC), is visiting
Washington, D.C. in a bid to publicize Taiwan's stance on the development of
cross-Taiwan Strait relations.</P>
      <P>Lai said that before her departure, Ma asked her to tell Washington that, for
Taiwan's new government, expanding the nations's international space is as
important as improving cross-Taiwan Strait relations.</P>
      <P>Lai said the Taiwan government's national policies are being developed based on
public opinion. Therefore, the government has to address the issue of expanding
Taiwan's international space, no matter how big the challenge, as there is a
wide domestic consensus on this matter, she added.</P>
      <P>She expressed the hope that Washington will assist Taiwan in this area, and
called on China to respect the Taiwan people's will and stop blocking Taiwan's
efforts to participate in international organizations.</P>
      <P>Lai was referring to an objection by China's Ambassador to the U.N., Wang
Guangya, to Taiwan's bid to access U.N.'s specialized agencies.</P>
      <P>Wang stated in a letter to the U.N. secretary-general Aug. 18 that China opposes
Taiwan's bid because Taiwan is part of China, not a sovereign state eligible to
join U.N.-affiliated organizations.</P>
      <P>But Lai said Taiwan  and China  have experience  of each participating  in
international  organizations,  such  as  the Asia-Pacific  Economic  Cooperation
forum and the World Trade Organization.</P>
      <P>This  experience  has allowed  the two sides  to minimize misunderstandings and
avoid conflicts,  Lai said,  adding that relations between the two sides will
benefit from an expanded role by Taiwan in other international bodies.</P>
      <P>Asked whether Taiwan will be able to join the World Health Assembly -- the World
Health Organization's decision making body -- as an observer next May, Lai said
this is hard to forecast as Taiwan and China need more time to put more issues
on the negotiation table.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan has given a directive for the Cabinet- level Sports
Affairs Council (SAC) to come up with mid- and long-term plans for the training
of athletes.</P>
      <P>Liu made the request Thursday after the SAC gave a review of the national
Olympic team's participation in the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games and the SAC's
vision for the future of sports in Taiwan, at a regular Cabinet meeting.</P>
      <P>According to Liu, the national team's performance in the 2008</P>
      <P>Beijing Olympics -- winning four bronze medals -- indicates a need to reform the
country's physical education system and its training of athletes.</P>
      <P>Liu suggested that for the country's athletes to perform better in international
events, it would require a breakthrough in sports training systems, strategies,
management, quality of coaches and athletes' long-term planning.</P>
      <P>Liu designated Minister without Portfolio Ovid J. L. Tzeng to supervise the
plan, with the assistance of the SAC and the Ministry of Education.</P>
      <P>He said that the plan should focus on the training and care of athletes,
refurbishing sports equipment, developing key-point sports items and schools,
and nurturing sports coaches.</P>
      <P>According to Liu, the nurturing of athletes and a sports environment calls for
time and a long-term commitment to hard work. The SAC should cooperate with
local governments to promote exercise and gradually shape Taiwan into a "sport-
loving island, " he suggested.</P>
      <P>"Though the team did not meet the people's expectations in the 2008 Beijing
Olympic Games, their efforts and spirit are still worthy of a big round of

    <HEADLINE>Atmospheric phenomenon 'elf' more frequent than 'sprite': survey</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  29 (CNA)
08/29/08  21:47:44
(by Zep Hu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The occurrence rate of the high-altitude atmospheric phenomenon "elve" was found
to be at least eight times that of another luminous event called "sprite,"
academic sources said Friday, citing the results of a three-year survey.</P>
      <P>The findings contradicted an existing hypothesis that sprites are the most
prominent phenomena among all "transient luminous events, " they added.</P>
      <P>The group of U.S., Japanese, and Taiwanese scientists who conducted the survey
also discovered that most elves -- rapidly expanding disk-shaped flashes --
occur over the sea, while sprites -- large yet weak flashes above active
thunderstorm systems -- mainly congregate over land.</P>
      <P>The "hotspots" of elves are found over the Caribbean Sea, South China Sea, east
Indian Ocean, central Pacific Ocean, west Atlantic Ocean, and southwest Pacific
Ocean, while sprite hotspots are found over central Africa, around the Japan
Sea, and regions close to the west Atlantic Ocean, the academics said in an
interview with the news service of the weekly New Scientist.</P>
      <P>"Elves may have an important  global effect on the lower ionosphere and the
total electron content, " said Alfred Bing-chin Chen, a team member and an
assistant professor at National Cheng Kung University.</P>
      <P>"Elf hotspots may increase the electron density of the ionosphere by five
percent or more, which could interfere with ground and space communication as
well as navigation systems, " he added.</P>
      <P>Using a piece of equipment called the Imager of Sprites and Upper Atmospheric
Lightning (ISUAL) on board the FORMOSAT-2 satellite, the team's original goal
was to observe and better understand the polar aurora, upper atmospheric
airglow, and lightning-induced atmospheric flashes -- especially sprites.</P>
      <P>"But in the end, we found many more elves instead, " said Chen, adding that in
the three years of observation, from July 2004 to June 2007, some 5,434 elves
were spotted around the globe, while only 633 sprites were seen.</P>
      <P>The team also recorded 657 halos and 13 gigantic jets, both of which are also
transient luminous events that occur in the upper atmosphere or lower
ionosphere.</P>
      <P>According to the team, the elve occurrence rate will rise sharply once the sea
surface temperature exceeds 26 degrees Celsius.</P>
      <P>"A warm ocean surface can provide the heat source needed to drive intense
oceanic lightning with very high peak currents, which usually generate elves in
the ionosphere," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chen said that the sprites require lightning with a higher overall
charge, and since such lightening mostly occurs over the land, sprites are more
frequently found there.</P>

      <P>About 160,000 underprivileged children in Taiwan encounter  difficulties  with
their school work due to deficiencies in the family, the Eden Social Welfare
Foundation and the Global Views Monthly said Friday, urging people to donate and
"give underprivileged children a chance."</P>
      <P>Underprivileged children are defined as children aged 6 to 12, from single-
parent, recomposed, divorced,  cross-generational or low-income families.</P>
      <P>The lack of economic or family support can easily lead to academic under-
achievement or even personality defects among these children, according to the
Global Views Monthly.</P>
      <P>The magazine and the foundation cited the example of Wang Yi-hsiung, a young boy
in central Taiwan who recently received an award from his elementary school
principal for his outstanding academic performance.</P>
      <P>Three years ago, the child, who is from a single-parent family, had fallen into
the habit of fooling around on the streets, they said.</P>
      <P>One day, after he got into a street fight, Chue Dai Shu-wei, a pastor's wife,
took him home and began to help him with his lessons. This was the beginning of
the child's road to academic excellence, Chue Dai indicated.</P>
      <P>"All social problems result from family issues, " said Chue Dai, adding that her
after-school class is not just a place for her 40 students to learn and review
their school work, but also provides a sense of family..</P>
      <P>"When children get good grades, they will have confidence and dignity, and
after-school classes will be more than just extra lessons," said Wang Li-hsing,
publisher of the Global Views Monthly, at a press conference.</P>
      <P>In order to give Taiwan's 160,000 underprivileged children a chance, a NT$10
million target has been set in a fundraising program aimed at funding community
organizations, such as churches and community development associations, to
provide children with free or low-lost  after-school  assistance,  the magazine
and the Eden Foundation said.</P>

      <P>Japan responded positively to Taiwan's recent efforts to improve its ties with
China and viewed them as conducive to peace in Asia, Taiwan's ruling Kuomintang
(KMT) Vice Chairman Chiang Pin-kung said Friday.</P>
      <P>Chiang made the remarks at the Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport upon his
return earlier in the day from a visit to Japan Aug. 25-27.</P>
      <P>Chiang's visit was aimed at helping Japanese politicians better understand
Taiwan's new KMT government 's diplomatic policy.</P>
      <P>Japan has had concerns that Taiwan might ignore its close ties with Tokyo as
President Ma Ying-jeou has been focusing on shoring up ties with China.</P>
      <P>China considers Taiwan a local province and has vowed war if the self-ruled
island moves towards formal independence.</P>
      <P>During his Japan visit, Chiang gave a speech to the country's business sector on
the prospects of relations across the Taiwan Strait and met with Japan's major
political parties and groups.</P>
      <P>Chiang, who is also head of the quasi-official Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF)
that handles cross-strait exchanges with China in the absence of official ties,
said Japan had responded positively to the new developments in the relations
between Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>For example, Taro Aso, secretary-general of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party,
responded positively to Ma's cross-strait policy and said he believed Taiwan's
pragmatic policy would help maintain peace in Asia, Chiang related.</P>
      <P>Chiang also said that Japan welcomed Taiwan's appointment of veteran diplomat
John Feng as its new representative to Japan.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chiang said, he also discussed future cooperation with Japanese
companies.</P>
      <P>Some Japanese companies suggested that it would be the best if Taiwanese
enterprises collaborated with Japanese firms to develop business in China, he
said.</P>
      <P>On the fishery talks between Taiwan and Japan, Chiang said he told Japanese
officials that he hoped both sides would soon complete the talks by shelving
political issues and focusing on economic matters.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan has slashed its proposed 2009 annual budget for secret diplomatic
missions, in light of the President Ma Ying-jeou's policy of seeking a
diplomatic "truce" with China.</P>
      <P>In its 2009 budget plan, released Friday, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
cut the allocations for secret diplomacy to NT$3.8 billion (US$120.4 million)
from the previous year's NT$5.7 billion.</P>
      <P>The 2009 budget for secret missions was slashed from the previous year's 12
percent to 6 percent of the MOFA's total diplomatic allocations, said MOFA
spokesman Henry Chen.</P>
      <P>"We believe that the cut is what the Legislative Yuan would expect," he added.</P>
      <P>Given that the new administration's diplomatic policy is focused on solidifying
Taiwan's relations with its 23 diplomatic allies, it is logical for the MOFA to
reduce the budget that was used to entice other countries to establish
diplomatic relations with Taiwan, Chen said.</P>
      <P>The MOFA's budget plan for 2009 focuses on solidifying ties with Taiwan's
existing diplomatic allies,  deepening friendship  and cooperative relations
with countries that have no diplomatic ties with  Taiwan,  making  active
efforts  to join  international organizations,  and expanding humanitarian
relief work in the international community.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Chairman of Far Eastern Group acquitted in Pacific Sogo trial</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taipei District Court on Friday acquitted Far Eastern Group chairman Douglas
Hsu of charges of forgery and breach of trust in the ownership transfer of
Pacific Sogo Department Store in 2002.</P>
      <P>The court ruled that Hsu did not obtain ownership of Pacific Sogo through the
help of then first lady Wu Shu-jen because his meeting with her at the
presidential residence came after the ownership transfer.</P>
      <P>Two other defendants -- lawyer Huang Mao-teh and financial consultant Champion
Lee -- were also acquitted.</P>
      <P>The court, however, sentenced Walter Lin, former chief of Waterland Financial
Holding Co., to two years in prison on charges of breach of trust because he had
not only failed to fulfill his promise to help the former Pacific Sogo owner to
obtain bank loans, but had done exactly the opposite to hurt his interests.</P>
      <P>Pacific Group former Chairman Chang Min-chiang, who claimed that he had lost
Pacific Sogo in a scam and was still counting on a civil lawsuit for justice,
expressed regret over the court rulings. He urged the prosecutors to appeal the
case in order to let the truth prevail.</P>
      <P>"If Lin is guilty, how come the person who took over Pacific Sogo from him is
not guilty?" Chang asked.</P>
      <P>In October 2006, Taipei prosecutors indicted the four men on charges of forgery
and breach of trust in the ownership fight over Pacific Sogo -- one of Taiwan's
most successful department stores.</P>
      <P>In a separate civil action still pending in the Taiwan High Court, Chang is
trying to have 600,000 shares in the Pacific Distribution Investment Co., which
owned Pacific Sogo, returned to him from his former landlord, Lee Heng-lung, who
was deputy chairman of the Pacific Group at the time.</P>
      <P>Chang said he had entrusted the shares to Lee in May 2002 after Lee and Lin
promised to help him get bank loans to tide Pacific Sogo over financial
difficulties caused by a flood in the typhoon season of 2001.</P>
      <P>Lee became chairman of Pacific Distribution Investment after the shares were
transferred to him. However, instead of helping Chang to obtain the needed
loans, Lee and Lin stripped Chang of his ownership of Pacific Sogo and replaced
the entire management team.</P>
      <P>Sensing that Lee and Lin might have ulterior motives, Chang began to let the
word out that he wanted to sell Pacific Sogo. Tsai Chen-yang, head of My Humble
House Group, was among the first to respond, offering to buy the department
store for NT$10 billion (US$317 million). But Lin and Lee, who were in full
control of Pacific Sogo then, rejected the offer, saying that someone at "a high
level" had a specific buyer in mind.</P>
      <P>The ownership fight became a tug-of-war among several business leaders, with
each claiming to have the support of either the Presidential Office or the first
lady.</P>
      <P>Chang claimed that Lee and Lin sold Pacific Sogo to Hsu by signing a secret
agreement in September 2002.</P>
      <P>The secret agreement came to light in 2006 after Lee claimed that the Pacific
Sogo deal had not yet been completed because Hsu had not fulfilled his part of
the agreement by giving Lee 33 percent of the department store's shares --
estimated to be worth more than NT$15 billion.</P>
      <P>Lee insisted in the High Court that it was Pacific Sogo, rather than Chang, that
had entrusted the 600,000 shares of Pacific Distribution to him. He maintained
that there was no written trust agreement between him and Chang regarding the
transfer of the shares and that Chang had no right to them.</P>
      <P>The High Court is scheduled to announce its ruling on the case next January.</P>
      <P>Throughout the court proceedings, there was wide media publicity of allegations
that the former first lady had been given millions of dollars-worth of Pacific
Sogo gift vouchers during the ownership fight over the department store.</P>
      <P>Taipei prosecutors, however, did not indict the former first lady because they
said in a report that although Wu, her daughter and son had spent NT$277,000
worth of gift vouchers they had obtained from Lee, there was insufficient
evidence to prove she had played any role in the Sogo ownership transfer deal.</P>

      <P>Education, science-technology research and cultural development will take the
lion's share of the government's budget for 2009, according to a Cabinet-drafted
budget plan referred to the Legislative Yuan Friday for screening and approval.</P>
      <P>The draft budget plan allocates NT$343 billion (US$10.96 billion) for education,
research and cultural spending for the coming year, accounting for 18.5 percent
of the government's total annual budget.</P>
      <P>The amount marks an 8.4 percent increase from the 2008 level and the ratio
registers a marginal growth of 0.2 percentage point.</P>
      <P>The ratio surpasses that of the defense budget for 2009, which will account for
17.2 percent of the total, ranking third in the government's various spending
items.</P>
      <P>Social welfare spending comes in second in terms of the ratio to the total
annual budget, accounting for 17.9 percent of the total and marking an increase
of 0.5 percentage points from this year's ratio.</P>
      <P>In terms of amount, social welfare budget is projected at NT$327.5 billion, up
9.8 percent from the current level.</P>
      <P>In contrast, defense budget for 2009 will decrease 3.2 percent to NT$315.2
billion. In 2008, defense spending accounts for 19 percent of the government's
total budget.</P>
      <P>According to the draft budget plan, the government projects its tax revenues at
NT$1.75 trillion and expenditures  at NT$1.83 trillion. As a result, the
government will have to issue state bonds in the coming year to make its ends

      <P>Japan responded positively to Taiwan's recent efforts to improve its ties with
China and viewed them as conducive to peace in Asia, Taiwan's ruling Kuomintang
(KMT) Vice Chairman Chiang Pin-kung said Friday.</P>
      <P>Chiang made the remarks at the Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport upon his
return earlier in the day from a visit to Japan Aug. 25-27.</P>
      <P>Chiang's visit was aimed at helping Japanese politicians better understand
Taiwan's new KMT government 's diplomatic policy.</P>
      <P>Japan has had concerns that Taiwan might ignore its close ties with Tokyo as
President Ma Ying-jeou has been focusing on shoring up ties with China.</P>
      <P>China considers Taiwan a local province and has vowed war if the self-ruled
island moves towards formal independence.</P>
      <P>During his Japan visit, Chiang gave a speech to the country's business sector on
the prospects of relations across the Taiwan Strait and met with Japan's major
political parties and groups.</P>
      <P>Chiang, who is also head of the quasi-official Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF)
that handles cross-strait exchanges with China in the absence of official ties,
said Japan had responded positively to the new developments in the relations
between Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>For example, Taro Aso, secretary-general of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party,
responded positively to Ma's cross-strait policy and said he believed Taiwan's
pragmatic policy would help maintain peace in Asia, Chiang related.</P>
      <P>Chiang also said that Japan welcomed Taiwan's appointment of veteran diplomat
John Feng as its new representative to Japan.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chiang said, he also discussed future cooperation with Japanese
companies.</P>
      <P>Some Japanese companies suggested that it would be the best if Taiwanese
enterprises collaborated with Japanese firms to develop business in China, he
said.</P>
      <P>On the fishery talks between Taiwan and Japan, Chiang said he told Japanese
officials that he hoped both sides would soon complete the talks by shelving
political issues and focusing on economic matters.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan has slashed its proposed 2009 annual budget for secret diplomatic
missions, in light of the President Ma Ying-jeou's policy of seeking a
diplomatic "truce" with China.</P>
      <P>In its 2009 budget plan, released Friday, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
cut the allocations for secret diplomacy to NT$3.8 billion (US$120.4 million)
from the previous year's NT$5.7 billion.</P>
      <P>The 2009 budget for secret missions was slashed from the previous year's 12
percent to 6 percent of the MOFA's total diplomatic allocations, said MOFA
spokesman Henry Chen.</P>
      <P>"We believe that the cut is what the Legislative Yuan would expect," he added.</P>
      <P>Given that the new administration's diplomatic policy is focused on solidifying
Taiwan's relations with its 23 diplomatic allies, it is logical for the MOFA to
reduce the budget that was used to entice other countries to establish
diplomatic relations with Taiwan, Chen said.</P>
      <P>The MOFA's budget plan for 2009 focuses on solidifying ties with Taiwan's
existing diplomatic allies,  deepening friendship  and cooperative relations
with countries that have no diplomatic ties with  Taiwan,  making  active
efforts  to join  international organizations,  and expanding humanitarian
relief work in the international community.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Chairman of Far Eastern Group acquitted in Pacific Sogo trial</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  29  (CNA)
08/30/08  11:18:07

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taipei District Court on Friday acquitted Far Eastern Group chairman Douglas
Hsu of charges of forgery and breach of trust in the ownership transfer of
Pacific Sogo Department Store in 2002.</P>
      <P>The court ruled that Hsu did not obtain ownership of Pacific Sogo through the
help of then first lady Wu Shu-jen because his meeting with her at the
presidential residence came after the ownership transfer.</P>
      <P>Two other defendants -- lawyer Huang Mao-teh and financial consultant Champion
Lee -- were also acquitted.</P>
      <P>The court, however, sentenced Walter Lin, former chief of Waterland Financial
Holding Co., to two years in prison on charges of breach of trust because he had
not only failed to fulfill his promise to help the former Pacific Sogo owner to
obtain bank loans, but had done exactly the opposite to hurt his interests.</P>
      <P>Pacific Group former Chairman Chang Min-chiang, who claimed that he had lost
Pacific Sogo in a scam and was still counting on a civil lawsuit for justice,
expressed regret over the court rulings. He urged the prosecutors to appeal the
case in order to let the truth prevail.</P>
      <P>"If Lin is guilty, how come the person who took over Pacific Sogo from him is
not guilty?" Chang asked.</P>
      <P>In October 2006, Taipei prosecutors indicted the four men on charges of forgery
and breach of trust in the ownership fight over Pacific Sogo -- one of Taiwan's
most successful department stores.</P>
      <P>In a separate civil action still pending in the Taiwan High Court, Chang is
trying to have 600,000 shares in the Pacific Distribution Investment Co., which
owned Pacific Sogo, returned to him from his former landlord, Lee Heng-lung, who
was deputy chairman of the Pacific Group at the time.</P>
      <P>Chang said he had entrusted the shares to Lee in May 2002 after Lee and Lin
promised to help him get bank loans to tide Pacific Sogo over financial
difficulties caused by a flood in the typhoon season of 2001.</P>
      <P>Lee became chairman of Pacific Distribution Investment after the shares were
transferred to him. However, instead of helping Chang to obtain the needed
loans, Lee and Lin stripped Chang of his ownership of Pacific Sogo and replaced
the entire management team.</P>
      <P>Sensing that Lee and Lin might have ulterior motives, Chang began to let the
word out that he wanted to sell Pacific Sogo. Tsai Chen-yang, head of My Humble
House Group, was among the first to respond, offering to buy the department
store for NT$10 billion (US$317 million). But Lin and Lee, who were in full
control of Pacific Sogo then, rejected the offer, saying that someone at "a high
level" had a specific buyer in mind.</P>
      <P>The ownership fight became a tug-of-war among several business leaders, with
each claiming to have the support of either the Presidential Office or the first
lady.</P>
      <P>Chang claimed that Lee and Lin sold Pacific Sogo to Hsu by signing a secret
agreement in September 2002.</P>
      <P>The secret agreement came to light in 2006 after Lee claimed that the Pacific
Sogo deal had not yet been completed because Hsu had not fulfilled his part of
the agreement by giving Lee 33 percent of the department store's shares --
estimated to be worth more than NT$15 billion.</P>
      <P>Lee insisted in the High Court that it was Pacific Sogo, rather than Chang, that
had entrusted the 600,000 shares of Pacific Distribution to him. He maintained
that there was no written trust agreement between him and Chang regarding the
transfer of the shares and that Chang had no right to them.</P>
      <P>The High Court is scheduled to announce its ruling on the case next January.</P>
      <P>Throughout the court proceedings, there was wide media publicity of allegations
that the former first lady had been given millions of dollars-worth of Pacific
Sogo gift vouchers during the ownership fight over the department store.</P>
      <P>Taipei prosecutors, however, did not indict the former first lady because they
said in a report that although Wu, her daughter and son had spent NT$277,000
worth of gift vouchers they had obtained from Lee, there was insufficient
evidence to prove she had played any role in the Sogo ownership transfer deal.</P>

      <P>Education, science-technology research and cultural development will take the
lion's share of the government's budget for 2009, according to a Cabinet-drafted
budget plan referred to the Legislative Yuan Friday for screening and approval.</P>
      <P>The draft budget plan allocates NT$343 billion (US$10.96 billion) for education,
research and cultural spending for the coming year, accounting for 18.5 percent
of the government's total annual budget.</P>
      <P>The amount marks an 8.4 percent increase from the 2008 level and the ratio
registers a marginal growth of 0.2 percentage point.</P>
      <P>The ratio surpasses that of the defense budget for 2009, which will account for
17.2 percent of the total, ranking third in the government's various spending
items.</P>
      <P>Social welfare spending comes in second in terms of the ratio to the total
annual budget, accounting for 17.9 percent of the total and marking an increase
of 0.5 percentage points from this year's ratio.</P>
      <P>In terms of amount, social welfare budget is projected at NT$327.5 billion, up
9.8 percent from the current level.</P>
      <P>In contrast, defense budget for 2009 will decrease 3.2 percent to NT$315.2
billion. In 2008, defense spending accounts for 19 percent of the government's
total budget.</P>
      <P>According to the draft budget plan, the government projects its tax revenues at
NT$1.75 trillion and expenditures  at NT$1.83 trillion. As a result, the

    <HEADLINE>EPA advises against barbecuing during Mid-Autumn Festival</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 30 (CNA)
08/30/08  13:30:19
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) on Saturday urged the public
to take pleasure in the beauty of the moon, instead of focusing on having
barbecues during the Mid-Autumn Festival, which falls on Sept. 14 this year.</P>
      <P>Chang Shun-chin, a senior technical specialist at the EPA's Department of
Environmental Monitoring and Information Management, noted that the festival has
become a national barbecue day, which he said is disastrous to the environment.</P>
      <P>EPA statistics show that the air quality around the island is usually poor
during the Mid-Autumn Festival, and the huge volume of of garbage that
accumulates during the festival period continues to be a nagging problem.</P>
      <P>Chang urged the public to "return to the core of the festival"-- an occasion for
family reunions and a time for family members and friends to chat and eat
delicious mooncakes and pomelos while appreciating the beauty of the full moon.</P>
      <P>He cited 2006 statistics, saying that barbecues that year contributed to 32
percent of the carbon monoxide concentration, 14 percent of the nitrogen oxidant
concentration, and 11 percent of the suspended particles in the air on the
festival day.</P>
      <P>Barbecuing also undermines the nation's efforts to reduce carbon dioxide
emissions, he said, noting that the EPA has estimated that if a family of four
burns 1 kg of charcoal during a two-hour period, this will produce 3.7 kilograms
of carbon dioxide. If 30 percent of the nation's population hold barbecues, this
will result in nearly 6,400 tons of carbon dioxide, he added.</P>
      <P>He recalled that during a "lights out day" activity June 21, more than 130,000
residents around Taiwan went outdoors to lend support to a campaign to mark the
annual summer solstice in an eco-friendly way.</P>
      <P>This helped to cut carbon dioxide emissions by 178 tons, which means that "a
total of 36 lights-out activities would be needed to offset the volume of carbon
dioxide produced during the Mid-Autumn Festival," he said.</P>
      <P>Discarded peripheral barbecue supplies, such as grills, paper plates and
disposal chopsticks also create an extra workload for cleaners, the EPA said,
adding that barbecues are also harmful to public health.</P>
      <P>Yuan Shao-ying, director of the EPA's Department of Environmental Sanitation and
Toxic Substance Management, said it has been confirmed that burning charcoal
produces the carcinogen PAHs.</P>
      <P>The charcoal sold in Taiwan markets is mostly from China and other Southeast
Asian countries and is of substandard quality, which means it could produce
higher concentrations of PAHs, Yuan warned.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou told an Italian weekly magazine that the situation across
the Taiwan Strait is different from that of Georgia and Russia, thanks to
thawing ties with China and the U.S. commitment to helping Taiwan maintain
adequate defense capability.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks when asked by L'espresso if the fact that the United States
sat by and watched the Russian occupation of Georgian territory was an
indication the U.S. cannot protect its lesser allies.</P>
      <P>The interview was conducted Aug. 22 in Taipei and was published Friday in the
latest issue of the magazine.</P>
      <P>Ma said the policy choice by the United States in dealing with the Georgia issue
is not new, and pointed out that Washington responded similarly to Russia's
attack on Chechnya in the 1990s.</P>
      <P>However, the cross-strait situation is different, Ma argued.</P>
      <P>He noted that the Taiwan Relations Act enacted by the United States in 1979 is a
piece of formal legislation under which the United States makes available items
necessary for Taiwan to maintain adequate defense capability.</P>
      <P>Furthermore,  over  the  past  20  years,  a  wide-ranging socio-economic
network has been established across the Taiwan Strait, which is sufficient to
repair any form of hostility between the two sides, according to the president.</P>
      <P>Both sides have also expressed the desire to forge a peace treaty if possible,
he said.</P>
      <P>He said it is time for Taiwan and China to seriously consider working out a
peaceful resolution to their differences after decades of confrontation.</P>

      <P>Yilan County has won the right to host the 2009 Taiwan Lantern Festival, a
county official said late Friday night.</P>
      <P>Yiu Wen-hsiang, head of the county government's Department of Business and
Tourism, said that the Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC)
Tourism Bureau has chosen the Yilan Sports Park in Yilan City as the site of
next year's festival to be held in February.</P>
      <P>The bureau launched the Taiwan Lantern Festival in 1990 to foster local culture
and bring the traditions  of Taiwan  onto the international stage. Since its
launch, the festival has grown to become one of Taiwan's largest and
internationally best-known tourism events.</P>
      <P>Yiu said that Yilan Magistrate Lu Kuo-hua had been actively striving since early
this year for the eastern county to win the right to hold the festival.</P>
      <P>Lu sent a group of county officials to the 2008 festival held in Solar City,
Southern Taiwan Science Park in Tainan County to learn more about hosting such
an event, according to Yiu.</P>
      <P>The county magistrate also recently led a delegation on a visit to the Tourism
Bureau to promote its bid, Yiu said, adding that Yilan was able to beat out bids
by four other counties, namely Hsinchu, Taoyuan, Nantou and Changhua.</P>
      <P>The Yilan Sports Park was chosen because it met the Tourism Bureau's
requirements that the site of the festival should have at least 1,500 parking
spaces, a road of at least 400 meters in length and 15 meters in width for the
staging of the event's float parade, as well as adequate shuttle bus services.</P>
      <P>The park also met the bureau's requirement that the area in the vicinity of the
festival site have sufficient lodging, Yiu said, noting that Yilan City has over
8,000 hotel rooms available to meet the accommodation needs of visitors to the
festival.</P>
      <P>According to Yiu, Lu welcomes the holding of such a major national festival in
Yilan and hopes that it will help promote the eastern county's tourism industry
and give a boost to the local economy.</P>
      <P>Yiu further said that Premier Liu Chao-shiuan is expected to formally announce
Yilan Sports Park as the site of next year's Taiwan Lantern Festival, during a

    <HEADLINE>Meals for seniors potentially big industry: EPD</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) is encouraging people
to invest in the business of food service for seniors, reasoning that the
industry has great potential, according to a statement released by the council
late Friday.</P>
      <P>The statement pointed out thatin 2007, citizens over the age of 65 accounted for
more than 10 percent of the population, which indicates a move toward an aging
society.</P>
      <P>In light of this situation, the Executive Yuan launched a program last year to
provide long-term care to disabled and low-income seniors, but the program does
not cover the needs of all senior citizens, the CEPD said.</P>
      <P>Citing data from a recent survey conducted by the Ministry of the Interior on
the lives of seniors in the country, the CEPD noted that 35 percent of people
over the age of 65 live alone or with their spouses. Some 62 percent of the
respondents, between 50-64 years old, said they think that the service of
providing nutritious food to the elderly is important, the council added.</P>
      <P>This potential market, coupled with higher buying power of seniors in the future
thanks to the national pension insurance system that will take effect in
October, will make it worthwhile to invest in the industry of food service for
seniors, the council projected.</P>
      <P>People who are interested in developing this type of business can learn from the
experience of the Hondao Senior Citizen's Welfare Foundation in Taichung City,
the CEPD advised.</P>
      <P>The foundation, on a CEPD commission, designed meal boxes specifically for
senior customers. The light and nutritious meals turned out to be quite popular,
drawing customers who ranged from 90-year-old grandmothers to office workers,
the CEPD said.</P>

      <P>World Vision Taiwan and If Kids Theater have teamed up to stage play on an
islandwide tour to teach children how to protect themselves from abuse.</P>
      <P>The organizations held a press conference at the Taipei Youth Activity Center
Saturday afternoon to announce the launch of the tour, with Ministry of the
Interior Children's Bureau Director Chien Hui-chuan and several young T.V stars
participating.</P>
      <P>After staging the play at the center's performance hall Saturday afternoon and
night, the troupe will hit the road to perform at 40 locations around the island
over the coming weeks to teach children how to avoid domestic abuse and how to
respond if they fall victim to such abuse. One of the options advocated is to
call the 113 hotline for counseling.</P>
      <P>The play is about a young girl who, after being physically abused by her father,
retreats into a fantasy world where she pretends to be a princess imprisoned in
a tower by a fire-breathing dragon and awaiting rescue by a handsome prince.</P>
      <P>The hero in the story is a bear who teaches the young girl how to muster the
courage and properly face the dragon, which represents domestic violence.</P>
      <P>The morale of the story, which is that the rescuer is actually the young girl
herself, teaches children the importance of self-protection.</P>
      <P>In addition to the performance tour, World Vision Taiwan is releasing a
15-minute DVD of a puppet show about children who face neglect, physical abuse
and psychological abuse, and the proper response measures to end such
mistreatment.</P>
      <P>The non-profit organization is also releasing a set of four comic books with
similar  themes to teach children  how to protect themselves.</P>
      <P>World Vision urged educators around the country to contact the organization by
phone or email to borrow copies of the DVDS and comics for their schools to help
spread the message to all young children in the country.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Ma helps promote mooncakes made by social welfare organizations</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou urged the public Saturday  to buy mooncake  gift boxes
made by social welfare organizations, as the Mid-autumn Festival is two weeks
away and the sale of the mooncakes made by these groups has been particularly
slow this year.</P>
      <P>"If we buy mooncakes made by the underprivileged and offer them to other
underprivileged people, such as the elderly and children housed in care centers,
that will be double assistance," said Ma at a press conference held jointly by
21 social welfare organizations.</P>
      <P>He also promised that the Presidential Office will set an example by purchasing
4,200 boxes of the mooncakes. Other government agencies under the Executive Yuan
will be also be encouraged to buy the mooncakes made by the social welfare
groups, he added.</P>
      <P>The Mid-Autumn Festival will fall on Sept.14 this year. The sale of mooncake
gift boxes has become in recent years one of the major economic resources for
social welfare organizations that care for mentally and physically challenged
people and those with Down syndrome.</P>
      <P>However, this year, sales have been slower as people are more reluctant to spend
money, due to the economic downturn and a crowded-out effect regarding donations
following the May 12 earthquake in Sichuan, China, the organizations said.</P>
      <P>According to Tsui Pin, director of the Eden Social Welfare Foundation's public
relations department, some enterprises that used to place mooncake orders have
hesitated this year on grounds that they have made donations to people in the
disaster areas in China.</P>
      <P>The Mainland Affairs Council said recently that Taiwan has donated more than
NT$1 billion (US$32 million) to survivors of the earthquake in China.</P>
      <P>To help promote the sale of mooncakes made by underprivileged people, Premier
Liu Chao-shiuan and Interior Minister Liao Liou-yi have been actively involved
in advertising campaigns.</P>
      <P>The organizations said they have tried hard to keep the sale prices at the same
level as last year -- even though the cost of raw materials has risen -- for
fear that their customers might hesitate to buy this year.</P>
      <P>"This is the 12th year that we are making mooncakes for sale, Su Kuo-chen,
executive director of the Children Are Us Foundation said recently. "We will
continue to make mooncakes under the pressure of soaring costs, in order to give
these children with Down syndrome a chance. "</P>

      <P>Administrators of four cities and counties in central Taiwan proposed Saturday
to allow Chinese visitors to Kinmen, an outlying island close to China southern
coast, to fly to Taiwan proper via the Kinmen-Taichung air route, in the hope of
attracting more Chinese tourists to the central region.</P>
      <P>The proposal was raised at a meeting in Taichung City among Taichung  Mayor
Jason Hu,  Taichung  County  Magistrate  Huang Chung-sheng, Changhua County
Magistrate Cho Po-yuan and Nantou County Magistrate Lee Chao-ching.</P>
      <P>Hu convened the meeting to brainstorm on measures to attract more Chinese
tourists to central Taiwan, as the direct charter air route between Taichung and
Xiamen, southern China, has been inactive since the July 4 grand launch of
charter flight services between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou, who has introduced polices for broader cross-strait
exchanges and advocated an end to the decades of tensions between the two sides,
has expressed concern over the low demand for the weekend direct charter
flights, Hu said.</P>
      <P>Hu related that Ma had called him to voice concern over the matter and to ask
that local government heads make an effort to boost the tourism-oriented flight
services.</P>
      <P>During their discussions, the four local government leaders outlined plans to
improve the cross-strait direct flight services and upgrade the facilities at
the Taichung Ching Chuang Kang Airport, according to Hu.</P>
      <P>The mayor said many tour and hotel operators in central Taiwan, which boasts
green forests and scenic mountains, hope that Chinese tourists who visit Kinmen
via the "mini three-links" would be permitted to travel further afield to the
central region.</P>
      <P>Hu also said that some shipping businesses have been advocating the launch of
direct passenger boat services between Xiamen and Taichung.</P>
      <P>"It would take only four hours to travel by sea from Xiamen to Taichung Harbor,"
Hu said.</P>
      <P>The admission of larger numbers of Chinese tourists to Taiwan is regarded as a
possible stimulus to the sluggish local economy, and the mainland is seen as a
vast market for Taiwan's agricultural products.</P>
      <P>At the meeting Saturday, Hu proposed that the four cities and counties make
inroads into Macau, a special administrative region of China, with their
distinctive farm products. They four municipalities have therefore decided to
organize a promotional delegation to Macau in December, he added.</P>

      <P>Local government heads in central Taiwan proposed Saturday that a free trade
area be set up at Taichung Harbor in Taichung County to attract foreign
investment.</P>
      <P>The proposal was made at a regular meeting of the local heads in response to a
request by a Japanese trading enterprise, Itochu Corp., Taichung City Mayor
Jason Hu disclosed.</P>
      <P>Itochu Corp.'s representative in Taiwan had expressed the hope that a free trade
zone could be established in central Taiwan to create a convenient investment
hub, Hu said.</P>
      <P>Itochu Corp. deals in products in various industries such as textiles,
machinery, information and communications, metals, oil and other energy sources,
general merchandise, chemicals, and provisions and food. It has 17 domestic and
139 overseas offices.</P>
      <P>Hu said Itochu has invested heavily in China and that a free trade area in
Taiwan would allow it to save logistics costs between China and Japan. The area
would also create great business opportunities for central Taiwan, and thus
benefit all three countries, Hu said.</P>
      <P>He said the newly developed Central Taiwan Science Park and the weekend direct
charter flight service between Taiwan and China that began in July are mainly
what prompted Itochu to look at central Taiwan as a potential free trade area.</P>
      <P>Lai Ying-hsi, director-general of Taichung County's Department of Construction,
said the Taichung Harbor will be a good free-trade location, given its size and
convenient marine transportation.</P>
      <P>Investors can also utilize the air services at the Taichung Airport which is
near the port and is located within the county, Lai said.</P>
      <P>Changhua County Magistrate Cho Po-yuan said that many foreign enterprises may
hesitate to invest in a free trade zone, as the current regulations stipulate
that at least 5 percent of a foreign company's workers must be aboriginal.</P>
      <P>Cho suggested that the central government study the possibility of revising this
regulation in order to create an investment environment that would be more
favorable to foreign enterprises.</P>

      <P>The Nantou County government said Saturday that it has adopted several measures,
including an underwater GPS system, to ensure the safety of participants in an
annual swim across Sun Moon Lake activity, which will take place Sunday.</P>
      <P>County government officials said that in view of the two deaths that occurred
last year during the activity, they have taken special precautions this year.
The activity, which draws thousands of enthusiasts to attempt the swim across
the scenic lake in central Taiwan, is now in its 26th year.</P>
      <P>The officials said that they will deploy 20 top-notch diving professionals and
equip them with propulsion equipment and underwater GPS systems for the first
100 meters, which is known to be the most dangerous stretch.</P>
      <P>The officials said the total distance is about three kilometers, and any
"unexpected physical problems" experienced by the swimmers usually occur during
the first 100 meters.</P>
      <P>A 72-year-old man died of a stroke soon after he jumped into the water last
year.</P>
      <P>The Nantou government, which sponsors the event, has moved up the activity to
the end of August, instead of in mid-September or later when it was usually
held, in consideration of colder water temperatures later in the year.</P>
      <P>This year, an electronic board will be erected at the starting point to show the
temperature of the water for the reference of the swimmers.</P>
      <P>The organizers have also introduced a color-coded system this year so that the
lifeguards can easily identify different groups of people, with physically
challenged swimmers and those over 65 years of age required to wear pink
swimming caps, while other participants will be required to wear red ones.</P>

      <P>The results showed that 36.1 percent of the respondents were satisfied with Ma's

Liu Chao-shiuan's performance, compared with 45.9 percent who said they were
not.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou expressed optimism for the first time Saturday about the
possibility of the United States giving the green light for the sale of a
package of weapon systems to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In recent weeks, Ma has repeatedly taken advantage of his meetings with visiting
American congressional members and think tank scholars to urge the U.S.
government to quickly approve the sale of seven categories of weapons that
Taiwan intends to buy.</P>
      <P>Addressing a gathering of retired generals Saturday to mark the upcoming Armed
Forces Day and Mid-Autumn Festival, Ma said that judging from recent
developments, he is convinced that the United States will give a nod to Taiwan's
arms procurement bid in the not too distant future.</P>
      <P>"Recent signs show that the U.S. administrative department would notify Congress
of its approval of our arms procurement package that covers seven types of
weaponry," Ma told his audience.</P>
      <P>The pending items are anti-tank missiles, Apache helicopters, Patriot PAC-3
missile batteries, diesel-powered submarines, P3C anti-submarine aircraft and
sea-launched Harpoon missiles and Black Eagle helicopters.</P>
      <P>In his speech, Ma also said that recent improvements in relations across the
Taiwan Strait should by no means be interpreted as a government attempt to give
up efforts to enhance the country's defense capabilities.</P>
      <P>Emphasizing the importance of honing the military's combat prowess  and
improving  its defense  arsenal,  Ma said combat preparedness is not to wage
war, but rather to deter war.</P>
      <P>"Only with powerful defense muscle can we negotiate with strength in future
cross-strait talks, " Ma explained, adding that Taiwan cannot afford to
negotiate with weak military capabilities.</P>
      <P>While Taiwan is more than willing to champion cross-strait reconciliation and
pursue permanent peace on both the military and diplomatic fronts, Ma said, such
lofty goals cannot be realized unilaterally.</P>
      <P>Noting that upholding peace is at the core of commemorating the country's Sept.
3 Armed Forces Day, Ma said his administration will not miss any opportunity or
possibility to advance or maintain permanent cross-strait peace.</P>

      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) defended its decision to ease the criteria for
confirming severe enterovirus cases this year, saying that the move will help to
accelerate epidemic control and prevention.</P>
      <P>The department made the remarks after a pediatrician said a sharp increase in
the number of confirmed severe enterovirus cases in contrast to low death rate
this year was mainly the result of the DOH's move to ease the criteria for
confirming severe cases.</P>
      <P>Noting that fighting epidemics is like fighting fire, Shih Wen-yi, deputy
director-general of the DOH's Centers for Disease Control, said timing is a
crucial element in epidemic control and prevention.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, Shih argued that it is necessary to adopt less stringent
criteria for the confirmation of severe enterovirus cases.</P>
      <P>This year, 349 confirmed severe enterovirus infections were recorded, accounting
for 74 percent of the overall suspected cases reported by local medical
institutions. However, only 10 related fatalities were documented this year,
representing 2.8 percent of the confirmed severe cases, a 10-year low ratio.</P>
      <P>Since the first enterovirus outbreak struck Taiwan in 1998, the death rate
generally ranged between 10 percent and 20 percent, according to official
records.</P>

      <P>The government will step up communications with the opposition camp on various
policy initiatives and exchanges of opinions on major public issues,
Presidential Office spokesman Wang Yu-chi said Saturday.</P>

Ying-jeou's  embrace  of China  and his administration's  failure  to improve

      <P>The first massive-scale protest rally in downtown Taipei since President Ma
Ying-jeou's May 20 inauguration concluded  smoothly  and  peacefully  Saturday
evening,  with demonstrators  calling for economic stimulus measures and more
cautious policies toward China.</P>
      <P>Tens of thousands of Ma's opponents from around Taiwan marched through major
Taipei streets before rallying on Ketagaland Boulevard in front of the
Presidential Office. They banged drums, waved "Taiwan Yes, China No" banners and
chanted slogans appealing for a better livelihood, protection of national
sovereignty and early passage of "sunshine bills" to wipe out corruption.</P>
      <P>Organized by the pro-independence group Taiwan Society, the rally came amid
worries among some people that Ma's efforts to boost Taiwan's sluggish economy
with China's help could erode and threaten Taiwan's sovereignty.</P>
      <P>The crowd included opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) legislators,
local officials and citizens from around Taiwan and offshore Penghu County.</P>
      <P>Lo Chih-cheng, secretary-general of the Taiwan Society, said the number of
participants was far larger than expected. "The crowd was more than 10 folds of
our original estimate," he added.</P>
      <P>The protest, which coincided with Ma's 100th day in office, was also the first
mass rally since the DPP lost power. An ongoing graft probe into former
President Chen Shui-bian and his family didn't deter demonstrators, many of whom
were staunch supporters of the DPP.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Yeh Yi-jin said the cash-strapped DPP didn't give any financial
support for the protest march and follow-up rally. "I was moved by enthusiastic
support shown by grassroots supporters, all of whom have paid for travel fares
out of their own pockets, " an emotional Yeh added.</P>
      <P>DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen also took part in the parade from Lungshan Temple in
western Taipei to Ketagalan Boulevard in central Taipei, receiving hearty
welcome from thousands of DPP fans.</P>
      <P>Addressing the rally, Tsai said she was pleased to see the street parade and
rally proceed orderly and peacefully without any hitch.</P>
      <P>Noting that the smooth proceeding of the demonstration signifies maturity of
Taiwan's democracy, Tsai said she will lead the DPP to move into a brand new
stage of development following the protest rally.</P>
      <P>Before the rally, some ruling Kuomintang lawmakers speculated that the rally
could be turned into an event to support what they called "corrupt A-bian" (the
former president's nickname).</P>
      <P>Tsai said she felt a relief from such worry as participants were all rational
and adhered to the themes of the rally. She promised to give supporters a better
DPP and work for a more democratic and prosperous Taiwan where "clean and
sunshine politics" prevails.</P>

      <P>The government will step up communications with the opposition camp on various
policy initiatives and exchanges of opinions on major public issues,
Presidential Office spokesman Wang Yu-chi said Saturday.</P>

downtown Taipei earlier the same day to protest what they called  President  Ma
Ying-jeou's  embrace  of China  and his administration's  failure  to improve
the economy and people's livelihood.</P>
      <P>Acknowledging the people's rights to assembly and demonstration, Wang said the

to solicit their opinions in policy planning  and seek their understanding  and
support for major initiatives.</P>
      <P>Wang also argued that the Ma administration's major policies are on the right
track. To live up to people's high expectations, he added, the governing team
will work even harder and adopt innovative measures to cope with the changing
global economic situation and revamp the sluggish domestic economy.</P>
      <P>The protest was the first rally against Ma since he took office 100 days ago.

    <TEXT>
      <P>More than 70 percent of reporters are considering changing their jobs due to
dissatisfaction with their low pay and long work hours, according to a survey
conducted by the online 1111 job bank.</P>
      <P>The survey  was conducted  Aug.  25-29  ahead of national journalists' on Sept.
1, and included incumbent and former reporters.</P>
      <P>On the issue of salary, 34.61 percent of the respondents said they were
dissatisfied with their pay, while 15.63 percent said they were very
dissatisfied.</P>
      <P>Among that group, 66.44 percent said their dissatisfaction was based on wages
being disproportional to long working hours, 55.56 percent cited heavy workload,
and 37.14 precent said their income was just not enough to cover their living
expenses, according to the survey.</P>
      <P>According to a cross analysis of the results of the survey, Web site reporters
were most dissatisfied with their pay, followed by radio, TV, magazine and

      <P>Some 40.5 percent of the reporters polled said they are required work 11 to 12
hours a day, and 35.09 percent work nine to 10 hours, with the average being 11

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan working to boost medical tourism</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>08/31/08  18:22:34</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Shen Jia,  a property development executive from Shanghai, impulsively added a
physical checkup to his itinerary on a business trip to Taiwan in early August.</P>
      <P>Shen was no stranger to routine annual health exams in China. But, he said, his
first experience with health care across the Taiwan Strait was surprisingly
impressive, especially with what he called the "humanized" and "civilized"
service.</P>
      <P>His health check at Shin Kong Wu Ho-Su Memorial Hospital in suburban Taipei
included a PET scan -- a cancer screening test that uses a positron emission
tomography (PET) scanner.</P>
      <P>Since the hospital introduced Asia's first PET scanner in 2001, the device has
been so widely used in physical checks in Taiwan that it has almost become basic
equipment in major medical institutions around the country. Currently, there are
more than 20 such machines in use nationwide.</P>
      <P>"There are not that many PET scanners on the mainland, and only two in
Shanghai," Shen noted.</P>
      <P>Shen's observations are not confined to the casual visitor. The British research
and advisory firm Economist Intelligence Unit in 2000 ranked Taiwan's healthcare
system as the second best in the world, behind Sweden.</P>
      <P>With such recognition under its belt, Taiwan is trying to take advantage of its
cutting-edge medical resources to reach out to international medical travelers,
in an attempt to break into a growing business worth an estimated US$30 billion
a year globally.</P>
      <P>The health care industry is advertising Taiwan's congenial hospital environment
as one that "emits no smell of medicine" and is promoting top-end physicals as
one of the country's pioneer products. Affluent, health-conscious travelers like
Shen are an obvious target group.</P>
      <P>The China market is a primary target in light of its geographical and cultural
proximity to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The potential for medical business from the mainland has grown since July
following Taiwan's move to admit larger numbers of Chinese tourists and the
launch of weekend cross-strait charter flights, which has made travel between
the two sides much more convenient.</P>
      <P>More significantly, Chinese tourists will soon be allowed to engage in
individual activities for a day and a half while on group sightseeing tours of
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"This regulation will be a major breakthrough, as Chinese tourists, under the
current regulations, cannot have medical checks in Taiwan, " said Walter Yeh,
executive vice president of the Taiwan External Trade Development Council
(TAITRA).</P>
      <P>"We have been preparing, and now we can finally take off, " Yeh added.</P>
      <P>Tourism Bureau statistics show that from July 18, when Taiwan officially opened
it doors to larger numbers of Chinese tourists, to Aug. 26, a total of 10,228
Chinese tourists had entered the country, with daily arrivals averaging 244. The
number of arrivals are expected to rise significantly when China eases its
controls on outbound travel in the wake of the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing.</P>
      <P>A spike in the number of visitors from China will swell the 3 million visitor
arrivals to Taiwan every year. TAITRA has estimated that if 10 percent of these
visitors each spend NT$20,000 (US$635) on physical examinations in Taiwan, this
will help to generate revenues of NT$6 billion a year.</P>
      <P>In June, Yeh led a delegation of representatives of 12 Taiwanese hospitals on a
medical tourism fact-finding tour of Shanghai, Quanzhou and Xiamen.</P>
      <P>The results were encouraging, according to a survey conducted by Taipei Veterans
General Hospital among Chinese industry players during the tour.</P>
      <P>The hospital -- the only public one represented on the delegation -- found that
90 percent of the respondents were interested in visiting Taiwan for pleasure,
and 50 percent were willing to travel to Taiwan for medical care.</P>
      <P>It was found that most respondents had formed a good impression of Taiwan's
health care service, through information channels such as the media and the
Internet.</P>
      <P>The respondents said they thought Taiwan's medical institutions had an edge in
terms of facilities, technology and services. They indicated that they were most
interested in seeking health care in Taiwan in the areas of physical
examination, dentistry and cosmetic medicine.</P>
      <P>According to Yeh, Taiwan can use physical checks and cosmetic medicine to "build
a brand, " until its other specialized health care services become better known
internationally.</P>
      <P>"We have many excellent products, but we need more publicity to reach a wider
group of people, " said Yeh, who will lead another larger delegation to Beijing
and Guangzhou in November.</P>
      <P>Taiwan hospitals are promoting packages that incorporate regional tourism and
physical examinations.  They are offering top-end, state-of-the-art routine
services such as cardiac computed tomography (CT) scans, cerebral magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) scans and whole-body PET scans, which cost between
NT$18,000 and NT$54,000.</P>
      <P>According to Hung Tzu-jen, vice president of the Shin Kong Medical Club HUng
Tzu-jen, only a limited number of the three types of devices used for these
scans are available in China, and they are employed mainly for diagnostic
purposes.</P>
      <P>"Unlike China, Taiwan is using the devices for routine health checks, " Hung
said, expressing confidence that Chinese business travelers will find the
customized services highly attractive.</P>
      <P>Another group of potential clients are the owners and executives of Taiwanese
businesses based in China. In March, Shin Kong Hospital served more than 100
business owners and executives who had returned from China for physicals, with
each spending an average NT$35,000, Hung said.</P>
      <P>Focusing on this target group, TAITRA recently held a seminar for Taiwanese
business people based in China, encouraging them to add sightseeing and health
examinations to their itineraries when they hold training programs in Taiwan for
their Chinese executives.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's ultimate goal in this field is to introduce  to international medical
tourists other high-end value-added medical services in which it excels, such as
liver transplants, cardiac surgery,  hip joint  replacements,  assisted
reproduction  and craniofacial surgery, Yeh said.</P>
      <P>Every year, hundreds of thousands of foreign nationals travel to Asian countries
such as Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia and India, for medical care. Taiwan, which
provides high-quality medical care at more competitive prices, is a slow
starter.</P>
      <P>According to the Taiwan Non-governmental Hospitals and Clinics Association,
which has been contracted by the Department of Health to help promote medical
tourism, liver transplant surgery costs half as much in Taiwan as in Singapore.
Plus, the survival rate in Taiwan for that procedure is the highest in the
world, the association said.</P>
      <P>Also, the cost of coronary artery bypass surgery is 30 percent cheaper in Taiwan
than in Singapore and 20 percent cheaper than in Thailand. Hip replacement
surgery in Taiwan costs 50 percent of what it does in Singapore or Thailand,
data provided by the association shows.</P>
      <P>With an eye on the revenue from medical tourism, Taiwan in May 2007 officially
listed medical care as a category under which visitor visas could be granted.</P>
      <P>Since then 292 foreign nationals from countries other than China have been
granted medical visas to visit Taiwan for cancer therapy and organ transplants.
In this group, 164 applicants were Filipinos, 59 were Indonesians,  and 20 were
from Malaysia and Vietnam, statistics from the Bureau of Consular Affairs
showed.</P>
      <P>From August 2007 to August 2008, 20 Chinese citizens were also granted
permission to visit Taiwan for medical care, according to the National
Immigration Agency.</P>
      <P>The figures did not include visitors who traveled to Taiwan for physical
examinations, cosmetic medicine or dental services -- categories that do not
require a medical visa.</P>
      <P>Lee Wui-chiang, director of the International Medical Service Center under the
Taipei Veterans General Hospital, agreed that complex specialized surgery is the
area in which Taiwan is most competitive. The top priority of Taiwan's medical
institutions is to gain the trust of international medical tourists, a process
that could take at least a couple of years, he added.</P>
      <P>"It is not an easy decision put one's life in the hands of an overseas
hospital," he said.</P>

Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Under the new rules, all elected local chiefs from the counties of Kinmen,
Lienchiang, and Penghu are required to post their plans for any visits to China
on a National Immigration Agency Web site prior to their departure, and within
one month of their return to Taiwan,  must submit a report to the Cabinet-level
Research, Development and Evaluation Commission (RDEC) ,  as are their
counterparts on Taiwan proper, said a MAC official.</P>
      <P>The RDEC will post their reports on its Web site.</P>
      <P>"This would allow the general public to better monitor the activities of the
elected mayors and magistrates," the official said.</P>
      <P>On July 3, the Executive Yuan eased the regulations on visits to China by city
and county chiefs from Taiwan proper, in tandem with the launch of nonstop
weekend charter flights between Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>Since July 4, many Taiwanese mayors and magistrates have traveled to China at
the head of delegations to promote bilateral exchanges, taking advantage of the
convenience of the weekend charter flights.</P>
      <P>Previously, Taiwan's local government heads were not permitted to visit China
except to take part in international events.  In mid-August, the MAC and the
Ministry of the Interior decided that Taiwan's mayors and magistrates must
publicize their plans to visit China and must submit a report to the Executive
Yuan and publicize the report on an RDEC Web site within one month of their
return.</P>
      <P>The new regulations have been made retroactive to July 3, the official said.</P>
      <P>Exchanges between Taiwan and China have been expanding since the May 20
inauguration of President Ma Ying-jeou, who is taking a more pragmatic stance
towards relations with China. The two sides reached historical agreements in
mid-June to launch nonstop charter flights on weekends and to increase the
number of Chinese tourists to Taiwan from 1,000 to 3,000 a day.</P>

      <P>Ferry services on a new route linking Shuitou wharf on Taiwan-controlled Kinmen
island and Wutong wharf in Xiamen, southern China were launched Sunday.</P>
      <P>The new route, which is the third to be opened between Kinmen and Chinese
mainland, will reduce the travel time by sea between Kinmen and Xiamen from one
hour to thirty minutes, according to Ho Chin-chang, owner of the Kinmen-based
Golden Star ferry which will ply the 8-mile route.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, Wutong is only a 10-minute ride away from Gaochi International
Airport in Xiamen, from which passengers can fly to other Chinese cities, Ho
noted.</P>
      <P>In order to provide passengers with easy access to downtown Xiamen, Ho said, the
Xiamen authorities have launched two bus routes linking Wutong, Xiamen
International Convention Center, the city's railway station, and its main bus
station.</P>
      <P>During the formal opening of the sea route at 12 noon Sunday, 82 passengers
boarded the Golden Star on its maiden trip to Wutong, amid the deafening sound
of firecrackers.</P>
      <P>At the same time, 230 passengers left Wutong for Shuitou on the Xiamen-based
ferry Wu Yuan.</P>
      <P>Yang Ting-piao, director of the Kinmen Harbor Department, said the four
additional ferry trips on the new route will bring the total number of boat
services between Kinmen and Chinese mainland to 28 per day.</P>
      <P>The other 24 services include 20 trips between Shuitou and Dongdu wharf in
Xiamen, and 4 between Shuitou and Shijin harbor in Chuanzhou.</P>

    <HEADLINE>China's worsening investment climate a challenge to Taiwan firms</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 31 (CNA)
08/31/08  21:15:44
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>China's worsening investment climate and a series of government austerity
measures to cool down the economy after the Beijing Olympics have emerged as a
severe challenge to many Taiwan businesses that were pioneers in that vast
market two decades ago, analysts said.</P>
      <P>With China's investment conditions rapidly deteriorating due to the
implementation of a string of a new policies relating to better labor
protection,  stricter land acquisition and more vigorous corporate tax laws,
most Taiwan companies in that country have been driven to rethink their business
development strategies, analysts observed.</P>
      <P>According to the results of the latest survey conducted by the Taiwan Electrical
and Electronic Manufacturers' Association among China-based Taiwan businessmen,
China's 2008 index in terms of investment climate has dropped for the first
time, while its index for investment risks has increased -- the first such
negative development in China's investment sentiment.</P>
      <P>During the 2000-2005 period, China posted a rise in the two areas, as the
association's past surveys had found. In 2006 and 2007, both indexes grew year
on year.</P>
      <P>The sharp changes in the Chinese market have pushed more and more China-based
Taiwanese  investors  to retool  their development strategies, analysts said.</P>
      <P>Many of them have shifted their operations to Southeast Asian countries and
India -- reflecting an altered mindset among Taiwan businessmen that China is no
longer the "sole" target of their investment projects, the analysts noted.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, Vietnam has been listed by Taiwanese enterprises as one of
their top 10 potential investment destinations.</P>
      <P>Lu Hung-teh, a professor at Chung Yuan Christian University in charge of the
association's 2008 survey, suggested that China-based Taiwan companies  revamp
their risk management  and investment diversification strategies in order to
better deal with unexpected losses.</P>
      <P>As a result of mounting operating difficulties in the Zhujiang Delta and
Yangzijiang Delta areas in China's southern and central coastal provinces,
Taiwanese businessmen clustered there are facing ever-increasing competition
from multinationals and China's private firms, with the Taiwan enterprises'
"first-mover" or "preemptive" advantages being eroded over time.</P>
      <P>In view of the huge changes in the Chinese market, Taiwan businesses should not
only forge new operating models, but also engage in industrial upgrades to drive
their sustainable growth, Lu contended.</P>
      <P>While many Taiwan businessmen might still remain undecided on whether relocate
to China's west or north regions or even to Southeast Asian countries, Lu said,
forming joint venturas with their Chinese private-sector counterparts might be
the most feasible approach to making a profit across the world.</P>
      <P>"This type of mutually beneficial strategy, rather than head-on competition,
will help create a 'win-win' situation for both sides, " he recommended. He
pointed to famous Taiwanese business groups, such as Master Kang, the top
instant noodle maker in China, Acer Computer, and Giant Inc., a leading bike
manufacturer, as examples.</P>
      <P>As Beijing's austerity policies encourage Chinese companies to build their own
distinguished brands and develop value-added sectors, it provides a good
opportunity for Taiwanese industries to team up with their Chinese counterparts,
Lu suggested.</P>
      <P>In 1987 when the Taiwan government removed long-term restrictions on cross-
Taiwan Strait exchanges, many of the Taiwan businessmen who edged into the
Chinese market around that time are now over 60 years old and are troubled by
inheritance problems -- a critical factor in their pursuit of sustainable
growth, Lu said,</P>
      <P>Citing the results of a survey made public in 2006 by a Taipei-based business
management research institute, Lu said 87 percent of the 161 Taiwanese
enterprises with operations in China's eastern and southern regions questioned
had inheritance problems.</P>
      <P>According to a poll released in 2007 by Britain's Cass Business School on global
top executives, the world's five most efficient CEOs under the age of 45 were
all from China. Eight among the world's top 10 CEOs were Chinese, while 37 of
the best 50 CEOs were from China, the poll found.</P>
      <P>The results  of the two polls showed a contrast  between China-based aging
entrepreneurs from Taiwan and the thriving young Chinese CEOs, analysts
observed.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Economics minister projects economic boost from deregulation</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 31 (CNA)
08/31/08  21:30:39
(By Y.L. Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's private investment and consumption indices are expected to rise in the
first half of next year following the deregulation of trade and investment
across the Taiwan Strait, Minister of Economic Affairs Yiin Chii-ming said
Sunday.</P>
      <P>In an interview with the CNA to mark the new Kuomintang administration's 100th
day in office, Yiin said there is no specific way to bolster the sluggish
domestic economy because Taiwan, as an open economy, is vulnerable to the global
economic slowdown and cannot resist the pressure of oil and commodity price
hikes.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's 2009 national economic growth was forecast at 5.08 percent -- lower
than the 6 percent target set by President Ma Ying-jeou during his election
campaign, according to a report released Saturday by the Directorate General of
Budget, Accounting and Statistics.</P>
      <P>The Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) reported recently that
the monitoring indicators flashed "blue" in July for the first time since the
outbreak of SARS in 2003, signaling a continued slowdown of the economy.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Taiwan's export orders in July showed only 5.52 percent growth year-
on-year, the slowest in over five years, with export orders from China posting a
meager 1.73 percent growth compared with the same month a year earlier,
according to statistics issued by the government.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the figures, Yinn said that the government faced many challenges,
such as soaring oil and commodity prices and the U.S. mortgage crisis, in the
its first 100 days in office. However, he said he believes that Taiwan can
overcome these difficulties, given the fact that it weathered the termination of
formal diplomatic relations with the U.S. in 1979, its withdrawal from the U.N.,
two oil crises, and the Asian financial storm.</P>
      <P>Yiin said that Taiwan stands a good chance of developing its economy, given its
advantageous geographic location. The island is bounded by the world's main
economic entities, with the U.S. in the east, Japan in the north, China in the
west, and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in the south, he
noted.</P>
      <P>Yinn also said that although inflationary  pressures  have gradually eased
recently, the country's economic performance is determined by many other
factors. He noted that almost every economy in the world is facing the dilemma
of balancing the objectives of sustainable economic growth and price stability.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan is unable to resist imported inflation, what it can do is strive to
achieve economic growth and work to take better care of the disadvantaged to
help them cope with surging commodity prices, he said.</P>
      <P>Yinn said that although various economic figures for the second quarter reflect
a weakening economy, he is more concerned about the figures for the third
quarter, as the Beijing Olympics are over and that could possibly have a
negative impact on Taiwan's economy.</P>

      <P>The ruling Kuomintang (KMT) and the opposition Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) share evenly the number of best lawmakers at the Legislative Yuan in an
assessment made by a civic group.</P>
      <P>In an assessment of lawmakers' performance at the eight committees in the
Legislature, Kuo Chung-hwa, chief of the Citizen Congress Watch said Sunday the
KMT and DPP each has for four best lawmakers.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislators Wu Chih-yang, Chao Li-yun, Lu Shiow-yen and Chiu Ching-chun were
considered lawmakers with the best performance in Home Affairs Committee,
Education and Culture Committee, Finance Committee and Economic Affairs
Committee respectively.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile DPP Legislators Twu Shiing-jer, Yeh Yi-jin, Wong Chin-chu and Lai
Ching-te were ranked as the bests in Foreign Affairs and National Defense
Committee, Transportation Committee, Judiciary, Organic Laws and Statues
Committee and Sanitation, Environment and Labor Affairs Committee separately.</P>
      <P>On the end, the civic group also named eight lawmakers with the poorest
performance in these committees, with KMT, which controls 81 out of the 113
seats in the legislature, took the lion's share of seven.</P>
      <P>They are Tsai Chin-lung,  Hung Hsiu-chu, Fu Kun-chi, Tsao Erh-chung, Chiu Yi,
Hsu Shao-ping and Chang Chia-chun.</P>
      <P>The remaining one is Lin Bing-kun of the Non-Partisan Solidarity Union.</P>
      <P>Ku said the assessment was made by a jury of 98 based on the lawmakers'
performace in last legislative session which concluded on July 18.</P>
      <P>The lawmakers' performance was measured by the ratio of their absence from
sittings, the number of times they spoke in the sittings and the number of
motions they initiated.</P>
      <P>Lawmakers who committed themselves to the cause of clean politics in the
Legislature were given performance in the assessment, according to Ku.</P>
      <P>He said he hopes the assessment will drive lawmakers to improve their
performance on the job.</P>
