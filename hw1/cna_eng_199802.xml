    <HEADLINE>FIRST ROC COMMERCIAL SATELLITE TO BE IN ORBIT IN MAY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  1 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's first commercial satellite, which
is expected to greatly advance the island's television and
telecommunications services, is scheduled to be launched on May 26 by
the French rocket Arianne 4 in Guyana, South America.</P>
      <P>The ST-1, Taiwan's first self-owned communications satellite,
will be launched under a collaborative sponsorship agreement between
Taipei's Chunghwa Telecom Co. and Singapore's Singapore
Telecommunications Corp., Chunghwa officials announced on Sunday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has long planned to launch its own communications
satellite, but the plan has not been implemented because Taiwan is
not a member of the International Telecommunications Union (ITU), a
United Nations affiliate, and therefore cannot obtain the right to
put satellites into orbit.</P>
      <P>Singapore came up with a cooperative plan in 1991 which would
allow the two sides to jointly launch a satellite. Singapore, a UN
and ITU member, undertook to apply for the orbit right for the
project.</P>
      <P>Under the cooperation agreement, signed in April 1996, Taiwan and
Singapore will each contribute US$120 million to the project and the
two countries will enjoy equal use of the satellite based on the
principles of "equality and reciprocity."</P>
      <P>The French Matra M-Space company (MMS), one of the four largest
satellite manufacturers in the world, has been commissioned to build
the satellite which will be launched into a geostationary orbit
36,000 km above northern Taiwan's Yangming Mountain.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the agreement, Taiwan and Singapore will each
build a control station and each will own seven C-band and eight
Ku-band transponders.</P>
      <P>Chunghwa Telecom will use the 15 transponders to provide
technically advanced television, telephone and digital
telecommunications services to a huge market encompassing Taiwan and
its offshore islands, Japan, and South Korea, as well as the entire
Asia-Pacific region and most of mainland China, the officials noted.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LOCAL  MAINLAND  CHINA  OFFICIALS  LINKED  TO PIRACY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  Feb.  1  (CNA)
(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Local government officials in southern
mainland China are involved in pirate attacks on commercial ships,
including Singapore-flagged vessels, in the South China Sea,
according to the International Maritime Bureau (IMB).</P>
      <P>Ports in southern mainland China are being used to shelter
vessels hijacked by pirates dressed in Chinese military uniforms, the
IMB said in its annual report on piracy and armed robbery against
ships. The IMB was set up and is sponsored by the International
Chamber of Commerce.</P>
      <P>The IMB said that it is worried by the fact that pirates in
Chinese military uniforms -- and equipped with modern automatic
weapons -- are intercepting passing ships in the South China Sea.</P>
      <P>"This is not the first time that southern Chinese ports have been
used to shelter hijacked ships," the IMB was quoted as saying. "Local
officials have been previously involved in criminal activities."</P>
      <P>The IMB was quoted as commenting: "It is unacceptable that China,
a major maritime nation, has failed to take action against this type
of criminal activity, where local government officials are clearly
involved."</P>
      <P>At least 12 such pirate attacks were reported last year, The
Straits Times reported on Sunday.</P>
      <P>There were 229 incidents of piracy reported worldwide in 1997,
one more than the previous year, according to figures compiled by the
Kuala Lumpur-based Piracy Reporting Center.</P>
      <P>These attacks spanned the globe, from Albania and Indonesia to
Nigeria and Venezuela.</P>
      <P>East Asia and Southeast Asia had the highest number of incidents
(105), with Africa next (37), followed by South Asia/Persian Gulf and
the Americas (both 34). The rest of the incidents occurred in
European countries and in Russia.</P>
      <P>The Piracy Reporting Center, a 24-hour information agency, was
created by the IMB and is supported by contributions from the
shipping industry.</P>
      <P>Besides the mainland Chinese attacks, the report also identified
these other trends:</P>
      <P>-- Highest risk area:</P>
      <P>Indonesia was the highest risk area, although the number of
attacks was reduced from 57 in 1996 to 47 last year.</P>
      <P>Many of the attacks were carried out by armed pirates who
threatened and assaulted crew members before robbing them.
 In the majority of these attacks,
the ships were boarded while they were at anchor.</P>
      <P>-- More violent:</P>
      <P>Modern-day pirates are becoming more violent. The number of crew
members killed in pirate attacks last year was 51, double the number
in 1996.</P>
      <P>Pirates are also more trigger-happy. There were 26 incidents of
ships being fired upon last year, compared to only six in 1996.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CROSS-STRAIT DIPLOMATIC TUG-OF-WAR TO INTENSIFY IN 1998</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  1  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The diplomatic tug-of-war between the
archrivals on either side of the Taiwan Strait is expected to become
even more intense this year as Beijing increases its checkbook
diplomacy aimed at the Republic of China's allies, local academics
said on Sunday at a roundtable meeting.</P>
      <P>Intensified diplomatic jockeying will also deal a further blow to
the already fragile state of cross-strait relations, although a
silver lining may become apparent in March with the possible
resumption of long-stalled cross-strait dialogue, said Prof. Pan
Hsi-tang of Tamkang University.</P>
      <P>Referring to the latest diplomatic switch from Taipei to Beijing
-- by the Central African Republic on Jan. 29 -- Pan said similar
money-fueled "diplomatic raids" by mainland China will become even
more of a problem in coming years as Beijing continues its attempts
to isolate the ROC in the international community.</P>
      <P>The Central African Republic's recognition of Beijing brings down
to nine in Africa and 28 worldwide the number of nations maintaining
formal diplomatic ties with the ROC.</P>
      <P>To prevent this figure from diminishing further, Pan suggested
that President Lee Teng-hui should preside over a nine-nation summit
in Africa when he visits that part of the world in April this year,
in an effort to smash Beijing's "one-by-one" diplomatic strategy.</P>
      <P>Pan reiterated that talks on political issues, such as the
interpretation of the "one China" policy, should be at the top of the
agenda when negotiators from the two sides meet for a fresh round of
cross-strait dialogue.</P>
      <P>Prof. Huang Hsiao-hsiang of Fuhsingkang University offered the
opinion that the main prerequisite for getting both sides back to the
negotiating table is a consensus on an end to this type of diplomatic
jockeying, which is one of the bones of contention keeping the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait apart.</P>
      <P>Prof. Wu Heng-yu, also of Fuhsingkang University, said that
unless the widely differing ideologies in Taipei and Beijing are
narrowed down, chances of the two sides sitting down to talk
seriously are slim.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SPECULATION RIFE IN TAIPEI OVER CABINET RESHUFFLE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  1  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Speculation over a forthcoming Cabinet
shakeup is rampant in Taipei, as the Chinese Lunar New Year holiday
draws to close and Premier Vincent Siew prepares to make good his
promise to reorganize his three-month old team.</P>
      <P>Although the exact lineup of the new Cabinet is still anybody's
guess, some common factors seem to be emerging from media reports of
the last couple of days.</P>
      <P>Legislator and ruling Kuomintang (KMT) Central Policy
Coordination Committee Vice Executive Director Huang Chu-wen is
reportedly to replace Yeh Chin-feng as interior minister. Yeh will be
reassigned as a KMT vice secretary-general.</P>
      <P>Education Minister Wu Jin, who enjoys the highest poll ratings
among the Cabinet, despite his whimsical ideas about education
reforms which often draw fire from critics, will possibly be replaced
by Lin Ching-chiang, a member of the Examination Yuan.</P>
      <P>Wu could be appointed as a minister of state in the Cabinet, but
the reports say Wu might turn down this new job offer.</P>
      <P>Chiao Jen-ho, secretary-general of the Straits Exchange
Foundation will replace James C.Y. Chu as chairman of the Overseas
Chinese Affairs Commission. Chu's possible new job was not revealed
in the reports.</P>
      <P>Government Information Office Director-General David Tawei Lee
and Vice Foreign Minister Chen Chien-jen are expected to switch jobs
with each other, while scholar-turned Minister of State Chan
Hou-sheng is tapped to head the Council of Labor Affairs. There was
no word on current CLA chairman Hsu Chieh-kwei, who offered to resign
at the end of last year because of low popularity ratings.</P>
      <P>Chairmanship of the National Science Council, which became
available when former head Liu Chao-shuan was promoted to vice
premier, may be taken up by Minister of State Yang Shih-chien,
although Huang Chen-tai, president of Feng Chia University, has also
been named as a possible candidate.</P>
      <P>Chen Po-chih, Professor of Economy at National Taiwan University,
is expected to be brought into the new Cabinet as a minister of
state.</P>
      <P>The mass-circulation United Daily News said on Sunday that Lee
Chi-chu, professor of economy at the National Chengchi University
will take the helm of the National Youth Commission, while the
commission's current chairman, Huang Teh-fu, will take over as
director-general of the KMT Youth Affairs Department.</P>
      <P>However, another newspaper, the China Times, listed Lee as the
new KMT youth department head.</P>
      <P>In addition to the possible new KMT vice secretary-general Yeh
Chin-feng and the possible new head of the KMT youth department,
Chang Jung-kung, deputy editor-in-chief of the Central News Agency
and an expert on mainland China affairs, is said to be a potential
appointee as director-general of the KMT's Department of Mainland
Operations.</P>
      <P>Siew, who is presiding over the shakeup in conjunction with KMT
Secretary-General John Chang, is expected to submit his new Cabinet
list to President Lee Teng-hui for his endorsement later on Sunday
before presenting it to the KMT's policy-making body -- the Central
Standing Committee -- for official ratification on Wednesday,
according to the evening daily China Times Express.</P>

    <HEADLINE>M'LAND CHINA'S LIMITS ON US WHEAT IMPORTS MAY HURT WTO BID</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Geneva,  Feb.  1  (CNA)
(By Maurus Young)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Beijing's continued refusal to accept US
wheat imports that are shipped from Pacific Northwest ports could
hurt mainland China's bid for membership in the World Trade
Organization (WTO), according to reports of the Geneva-based world
trade body Sunday.</P>
      <P>For years, mainland China has barred US wheat imports that move
through Pacific Northwest ports -- including more than a third of
North Dakota's wheat production -- citing fears it is infected with a
fungus called TCK smut. But US scientists and others have argued
there is no scientific basis for those fears.</P>
      <P>US officials have cited the restrictions as an unfair trade
barrier designed to protect mainland China's domestic wheat
production, but mainland China still refuses to lift the
restrictions, the report said.</P>
      <P>In a letter to Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-ND, US President Bill Clinton
said he raised the issue in a face-to-face meeting in October with
mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin, indicating it could hurt
mainland China's chances of gaining entrance to the WTO, according to
the report.</P>
      <P>He also said he will continue to pursue the matter with mainland
Chinese officials and will present additional scientific evidence to
support the US position that mainland China's restrictions are
unjustified, the report said.</P>
      <P>The restrictions have hurt US wheat producers, particularly in
North Dakota. In 1996 mainland China sold US$40 billion more of its
goods to the United States than it purchased from America. That trade
deficit is expected to have grown to US$50 billion in 1997.</P>
      <P>Mainland China's wheat imports have fallen drastically as the
result of increased domestic production. Total wheat imports have
gone from 12.52 million metric tons in 1995-96 to a projected 2.0
million metric tons in 1997-98.</P>
      <P>During the same period, US wheat exports fell from 33.78 million
metric tons in 1995-96 to a projected 29.26 million metric tons in
1997-98.</P>

    <HEADLINE>WORLD BANK STUDYING WAYS TO SLOW DOWN CURRENCY FLOWS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  Feb.  2  (CNA)
(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The World Bank is studying ways to
moderate foreign currency flows in the light of instability in Asian
financial markets, World Bank President James Wolfensohn said in
Singapore Sunday.</P>
      <P>"One of the issues raised by (Malaysian) Prime Minister Mahathir
was the impact of currency speculation and I think that it is an
issue that deserves serious attention and that's why we're studying
it," he said after a meeting here with representatives of the
International Confederation of Free Trade Unions from the region.</P>
      <P>At last September's World Bank/International Monetary Fund annual
meetings in Hong Kong, Mahathir had proposed regulating currency
trading, particularly in relation to hedge fund activities. He later
said the World Bank had asked for a Malaysian expert to be seconded
to the organization to assist it in looking into the matter.</P>
      <P>Wolfensohn said Sunday that he would be "getting ideas" from both
Mahathir and Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister
Anwar Ibrahim when he visits Kuala Lumpur as part of his Asian tour
to study the social impact of the ongoing financial crisis.</P>
      <P>His other stops include Thailand, Indonesia, South Korea and the
Philippines.</P>
      <P>Among the suggestions to curb currency flows was the levying of a
tax on foreign currency transactions, also known as a Tobin Tax,
after the Nobel Prize-winning economist James Tobin.</P>
      <P>"There are other ideas like deposit schemes, barriers that can be
put up at the borders; but each one of these is difficult," he said.</P>
      <P>"And you've got to look not only whether it's going to cut down
the flow of trading, or whether it's going to cut down the flow of
real resources and so it needs to be looked at."</P>
      <P>Although he declined to say when the study would be completed, he
added: "I don't think the answer is simple. Nor do I think that
currency speculation is the cause of all the problems in Asia. What
we need to do is to have some sort of balance."</P>
      <P>Wolfensohn said that the purpose of his visit to Singapore was to
consult with the Singapore government on regional developments.</P>
      <P>He is scheduled to meet Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong
and Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong Monday. He had a dinner
meeting with Finance Minister Hu Tsu Dow Sunday night.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ASIAN CRISIS SEEN CUTTING AUSTRALIA'S ECONOMIC GROWTH RATE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Feb.  2 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Asian economic crisis is expected to
cut about 1 percent from Australia's gross domestic product (GDP)
growth rate, according to Westpac Banking Corp., one of the country's
four biggest banks.</P>
      <P>In a televised interview Sunday night, Westpac chief executive
Bob Joss said: "Our economists feel that it will knock about one
percentage point off growth, so instead of 4 percent growth, we'll
have 3 percent growth.</P>
      <P>"I think ... it might even be worse than that, but it's just a
guess at this stage, nobody really knows," he added.</P>
      <P>Joss' forecast is in striking contrast with the Federal
government's forecast over the impact of the Asian economic turmoil.</P>
      <P>Prime Minister John Howard has repeatedly said that there is no
reason to revise Australia's economic forecast of about 4 percent in
GDP growth in fiscal 1998-99. Howard and Treasurer Peter Costello
have said the Asian crisis would only wipe out 0.5 percent of
Australia's economic growth rate.</P>
      <P>That means Australia's GDP would drop to 3.25 percent from the
original forecast of 3.75 percent.</P>
      <P>Howard said the Australian economy will be protected from the
Asian impact because of his strong economic management and measures
taken to address the budget deficit.</P>
      <P>But Joss was more circumspect, noting the already substantial
impact on the Australian dollar, which has sharply fallen to the
current 68 US cents from almost 80 US cents in March 1997.</P>
      <P>"If you look at the foreign exchange markets and the markets in
terms of the debt of these countries, it has had a very large
immediate impact ... but you don't see the real economic impact where
it starts to impact orders and sales and business decisions," he
said.</P>
      <P>"It always takes a while to flow through, whether it is the
American economy or the Australian economy," he added.</P>
      <P>He said the impact of the Asian crisis will be felt throughout
the year. "Asia is a fourth of the world's population, and we are all
tied up in the world. I mean, we are an international trading country
and our economy is very intertwined with Asia, so of course we'll be
impacted, as will the Americans," he said.</P>

      <P>Bad banking is mainly to blame for Asia's
current economic problems, according to Professor Paul Krugman of the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), who contends that the
region's poorly regulated financial institutions and massive asset
inflation caused the current turmoil.</P>
      <P>Krugman made the comments in a paper on the subject presented

      <P>The renowned economist asserted in his paper that the Asian
financial crisis is "mainly about bad banking and its consequences."</P>
      <P>No fan of the Asian economic miracle, he has argued consistently
that the region's growth rates would slow down eventually as
diminishing returns set in, according to the laws of economics.</P>
      <P>However, even he was astonished at the speed and extent of the
current turmoil, having predicted a long-term slowdown.</P>
      <P>"What we have actually seen is something both more complex and
more drastic: collapses in domestic asset markets, widespread bank
failures, bankruptcies on the part of many firms, and what looks
likely to be a much more severe real downturn than even the most
negative-minded anticipated," he was quoted as saying.</P>
      <P>In just seven months since the crisis was sparked off by the
devaluation of the Thai baht last July, some regional currencies have
shed more than half their values, losing more than a decade's advance
against the US dollar.</P>
      <P>Some economists have used traditional "textbook" theory to blame
the present problems on the poor fundamentals of the region's
economies.</P>
      <P>However, Krugman rejected this, reasoning that economic
fundamentals of the nations involved were largely sound, the report
said.</P>
      <P>The governments were in fiscal balance and had responsible credit
creation and monetary policies, while inflation and unemployment
rates were low, he wrote.</P>
      <P>According to traditional economic theory, investors will pull out
of a currency only if they believe it is likely to fall due to weak
fundamentals, resulting in a self-fulfilling crisis.</P>
      <P>Instead, Krugman argued that the woes were "brought on by
financial excess and then financial collapse" in which the currency
crisis is "more a symptom than a cause."</P>
      <P>The root of the problem is the implicit government guarantee to
financial bodies and the absence of adequate supervision, he
contended.</P>
      <P>For instance, he said, Thai finance companies had guaranteed
liabilities until recently.</P>
      <P>In December last year, Thailand closed down 56 of its 58 crippled
finance firms, which had accumulated US$16 billion in bad debts, as
part of the conditions of the International Monetary Fund-led
bail-out of the economy.</P>
      <P>Another example is South Korea, whose government arranged bank
loans to the country's highly leveraged conglomerates, which were
seen as the engine of growth.</P>
      <P>South Korean bank debt, said Krugman, was in the process of being
taken over by the government.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that with such guarantees, Asian financial
institutions were encouraged to undertake excessively risky
investments, and engage in "the logic of moral hazard."</P>
      <P>Moral hazard is a term used by economists to describe a situation
when decision makers do not fully bear the consequences of their
decisions. This then gives the banks an incentive to "play a game of
heads I win, tails the taxpayer loses," said Krugman.</P>
      <P>Since deposits are backed by the state, with underregulation
there is little accountability for financial institutions that have
fewer qualms about overlending or lending to high-risk borrowers.</P>
      <P>The result of such an over-guaranteed and under-regulated finance
sector, Krugman argued, is excessive investment.</P>
      <P>This in turn fuels asset inflation, especially since the supply
of assets -- such as property -- tends to be less responsive to price
changes.</P>
      <P>So the bubble of over-investment, increased debt and rising asset
prices gets bigger and bigger, until one day, when over-optimistic
returns to investment are not realized, the bubble bursts.</P>
      <P>The system collapses when implicit guarantees, in the form of
bank bail-outs and liquidity injections, become too expensive for the
government to honor, Krugman said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The satellite communications business in
Taiwan is scheduled to kick off in July, two months after the launch
of the island's first commercial satellite, the Chunghwa Telecom Co.
said on Monday.</P>
      <P>An official with Chunghwa Telecom said that the satellite, named
ST-1, is being built by Europe's Matra Marconi Space Group, one of
the world's top four satellite makers, and is scheduled to be
launched in May on a French Arianne 4 rocket in Guyana, South America
into a geostationary orbit 36,000 km above northern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The official said that the satellite is a joint venture of
Chunghwa Telecom and its Singapore counterpart, Singapore Telecom,
with both sides splitting the US$240 million project cost under a
cooperative agreement signed in April 1996.</P>
      <P>The ST-1, to be equipped with a number of advanced transponders,
will cover the entire Asia-Pacific area, including Taiwan, mainland
China, Japan, South Korea and Singapore and other Southeast Asian
countries. It is expected to be especially helpful to businesses
involved in remote communication, video and audio broadcasting and
information transmission.</P>
      <P>Chunghwa Telecom and Singapore Telecom will each build a control
station, the official said, adding that several communications
companies in Taiwan have contacted Chunghwa to learn the details of

    <TEXT>
      <P>ROC Foreign Minister Jason Hu
arrived here Sunday from Taipei, Taiwan, to begin his visit to
Swaziland and Malawi, the two countries in Southern Africa with
diplomatic ties to the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>In an interview with the CNA at Manzini airport near the
country's capital of Mbabane, Hu said that during his two day stay in
Swaziland he will extend President Lee Teng-hui's greetings to King
Mswati III.</P>
      <P>Swaziland, which is bordered by South Africa and Mozambique, has
maintained close relations with the ROC since the two nations forged
diplomatic ties in 1968.</P>
      <P>In addition to King Mswati III, the ROC foreign minister said he
will also call on Swaziland Prime Minister Sibusiso Dlamini, Foreign
Minister Arthur Khoza and other high-ranking officials to exchange
opinions on issues on mutual concern.</P>
      <P>Hu noted the trip is aimed at strengthening the ROC's ties with
its allies in Southern Africa in the wake of the Central African
Republic switching diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing last
Thursday.</P>
      <P>With the switch, the number of countries maintaining official
relations with the ROC has been reduced to 28.</P>
      <P>During the brief interview, the foreign minister stated the fact
that China has been divided since the 1949 civil war.</P>
      <P>He stressed that the 21 million people on Taiwan have the right
to enjoy democracy, freedom and prosperity and that the ROC on Taiwan
deserves space in the international community.</P>
      <P>Beijing, which regards Taiwan as a renegade province, spares no
effort to stamp out international recognition of the ROC.</P>
      <P>Hu added that although the unification of China is important to
every Chinese person around the world, its realization must guarantee
a better, not worse, life will follow.</P>

(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia began a historic constitutional
convention on Monday that will determine whether or not the country
becomes a republic.</P>
      <P>Altogether 152 delegates from all walks of life throughout
Australia are taking part in the two-week meeting to discuss in
detail how the country might become a republic and how the head of
the newly-defined government -- a president -- would be elected.</P>
      <P>Half of the 152 delegates were elected, while the rest were
appointed by the federal government.</P>
      <P>With most of the delegates declaring themselves republicans, the
convention is expected to dump the British monarch as Australia's
head of state, analysts said.</P>
      <P>On the eve of the conference in Canberra, Malcolm Turnbull,
chairman of the Australian Republican Movement (ARM), said he had an
open mind on provisions that would give the prime minister the power
of dismissal, codify the president's powers in the Constitution
rather than leaving them to convention and have a public nomination
process for presidential candidates.</P>
      <P>The ARM has the largest single group at the convention, with 27
elected delegates, while Australians for Constitutional Monarchy
(ACM), which supports keeping the British monarch Australia's head of
state, has 18 elected delegates.</P>
      <P>ACM executive director Kerry Jones said her group would be
calling for a referendum as soon as possible to decide the future of
the country.</P>
      <P>"We say to republicans: It is your responsibility to get your act
together and say what model you want to fight us on in a real
referendum so we can all stop wasting time and money," she said.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  2 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>As a result of hot trading between the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait, two-way cross-strait trade reached US$22
billion in the first 11 months of last year, up 10.7 percent from the
same period of 1996, the Board of Foreign Trade (BOFT) revealed on
Monday.</P>
      <P>Releasing these latest statistics, the bureau pointed out that
the amount accounted for 10.2 percent of Taiwan's entire overseas
trade in that 11-month period, and that spurred on by active business
activities, the island's trade surplus with mainland China surged to
US$14.9 billion.</P>
      <P>According to the BOFT statistics, Taiwan exported US$18.47
billion worth of products to the mainland during the January-November
1997 period, up 8.1 percent from the same months in the previous
year.</P>
      <P>The BOFT attributed the growth in exports to the mainland's
increasing demand for raw materials for chemical products, and for
mechanical parts and components originating in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>During the 11-month period, the statistics showed, Taiwan's
imports from mainland China, mostly agricultural products and
industrial raw materials, reached US$3.53 billion, up 26.5 percent.</P>
      <P>November saw cross-strait trading reaching two new record highs,
with the island's exports to mainland China climbing to US$2.07
billion and its imports from the mainland registering US$380 million
in that 30-day period, according to the BOFT tallies.</P>

      <P>Archbishop Paul K.H. Shan of Kaohsiung left
for the Vatican on Monday to accept the honor of being elevated to
the post of cardinal by Pope John Paul II in a ceremony Feb. 21.</P>
      <P>Shan was named a cardinal on Jan. 18, making him the first

Pin in 1978. Yu was raised to the cardinalship in Nanking on the
Chinese mainland before the government of the Republic of China
relocated to Taiwan in 1949.</P>
      <P>John Paul's move was seen by Taipei as indicative of the
importance the Vatican attaches to Taiwan's political democratization
and religious freedom, as well as to the long-lasting relations
between the Holy See and ROC.</P>
      <P>During his stay in Vatican City, Shan will also attend

      <P>A delegation of three prominent US
religious leaders will leave for mainland China next week for a
three-week trip to observe the climate for religious freedom under
communist Chinese rule.</P>
      <P>The three religious leaders are Rabbi Arthur Schneier, president
of the Appeal of Conscience Foundation; Archbishop Theodore McCarrick
of the Roman Catholic diocese of Newark; and the Rev. Don Argue,
president of the National Association of Evangelicals.</P>
      <P>President Bill Clinton appointed them to the delegation to
observe religious freedom in mainland China when mainland Chinese
President Jiang Zemin was visiting Washington in late October last
year.</P>
      <P>The delegation will depart on Feb. 8 for a three-week trip that
will take the three American religious leaders to Beijing, Shanghai,
Nanjing, Hong Kong and Lhasa, the capital of Tibet. They will meet
with Jiang Zemin, other senior mainland Chinese officials, and
religious leaders of the Buddhist, Catholic, Protestant, Moslem and
Taoist communities. In Hong Kong, they will also meet with leaders of
the Jewish community.</P>
      <P>The delegation will call on White House National Security Adviser
Sandy Burger Monday to discuss the goals and nature of the
forthcoming trip.</P>
      <P>During the past year, violations of religious freedom in mainland
China have become a focus of US congressional debate. Shortly before
going into recess in November, the House of Representatives passed a
bill by a 366-54 vote to deny US visas to all mainland Chinese
officials who help Beijing carry out its policy of religious
persecution. The action was largely symbolic because the Senate did
not take up the legislation before adjournment.</P>
      <P>Both the US State Department and Human Rights Watch/Asia put out
detailed reports in the second half of last year criticizing Beijing
for its violations of religious freedom. According to the reports,
Tibetan Buddhists, Moslems in Xinjiang, and the Catholic underground
churches in various cities of mainland China have suffered the most

      <P>The Republic of China's government spokesman,
David Lee, on Monday described his current trip to Japan as fruitful,
saying that he is glad to have had the chance to meet with the
leaders of Japan's mass media.</P>
      <P>At a luncheon with Taiwanese reporters stationed in Japan, Lee
said that in the past six days he visited the Yomiuri Shimbun,
Mainichi Shimbun, Asahi Shimbun, Sankei Shimbun, Nihon Keizai Shimbun
and NHK, exchanging views with the leaders of these mass media
organizations on issues of mutual concern.</P>
      <P>Lee said that the Japanese mass media is most concerned about and
interested in the effect the financial turmoil that has swept the
Asian area might have on the rest of the world and the development of
relations across the Taiwan Strait, adding that Hong Kong-related
issues and the possible devaluation of the Reminbi were also often
discussed in the meetings.</P>
      <P>Lee said that on many occasions he told the Japanese media
leaders that with the Cold War era over, the zero-sum paradigm should
no longer be used in interpreting relations involving Tokyo, Beijing
and Taipei.</P>
      <P>He also expressed the hope to the influential mass media leaders
that while developing its relations with the mainland China, Japan
will also further its friendly and substantial ties with the ROC.</P>
      <P>On news reports in Taiwan that he will exchange his post of
director-general of the Government Information Office for that of

is not sure about this.</P>
      <P>This is Lee's first trip to Japan since assuming his current post
last May. He arrived in Tokyo on Jan. 28 and is scheduled to return
to Taipei on Tuesday.

(By J. S. Chang and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Swazi King Mswati III on Manday reaffirmed
his country's firm commitment to the Republic of China, saying
Swaziland will continue to support the ROC's bid to join major
international organizations and activities.</P>
      <P>Mswati made the statement while meeting with ROC Minister of
Foreign Affairs Jason Hu, who arrived here on Sunday for a brief
visit aimed at shoring up friendly relations between the two
countries.</P>
      <P>Mswati said he is grateful for all the assistance and
encouragement the ROC has extended to his country over the past
years.</P>
      <P>"I hope ROC-Swazi cooperation will be further reinforced in the
future," Mswati said, adding Hu's current visit to Mbabane signifies
the ROC's sincerity to promote bilateral relations.</P>
      <P>The Swazi king went on to say that South Africa's switch of
diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing on Jan. 1 will by no
means affect his country's relations with the ROC. Because
of geographic proximity, Swaziland has traditionally maintained
close ties with South Africa.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Mswati said Swaziland will not follow the lead of
South Africa in adjusting its relations with the ROC. "As an
independent sovereign state, Swaziland will decide on its own
with which country it will maintain formal diplomatic ties," he
stressed.</P>
      <P>Noting that he fully understands the difficulties the ROC faces
in the diplomatic front, Mswati said his country will continue to
support the ROC in the international community.</P>
      <P>For his part, Hu said he appreciates the Swazi government's firm
commitment to the ROC. He also assured the Swazi king that the ROC
government and people will work hand in hand to boost
cooperative ties with Swaziland.</P>
      <P>Hu was accompanied by ROC Ambassador to Swaziland Enti Liu
during his meeting with King Mswati.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, Hu also met with Swazi Prime Minister
Sibusiso Dlamini to discuss concrete measures to promote bilateral
cooperation.</P>
      <P>Dlamini assured Hu that Swaziland will neither adjust its
30-year diplomatic ties with the ROC nor waver in its support for
Taiwan's basic stance.</P>
      <P>Dlamini said Swaziland will sign an investment protection accord
with the ROC in March when the two countries will hold a
ministerial-level economic and technological cooperation conference
in Mbabane. "The accord is aimed at attracting more Taiwan companies
to invest in our country," he added.</P>
      <P>Dlamini said the Swazi government has set up an Investment
Promotion Authority to lure investors from Taiwan and other
countries around the world. "We need foreign capital and expertise
to help upgrade our agriculture, education and infrastructure as
well as boost our general economic development."</P>
      <P>The Swazi prime minister told Hu that Taiwan's Tuntex Group has
set up a garment production facility in Swaziland, which currently
hires 500 Swazi workers. Dlamini said he hopes more Taiwan
entrepreneurs will establish plants in Swaziland to help lower its
unemployment rate.</P>
      <P>On Monday, Hu also met with his Swazi counterpart, Arthur Khoza,
and invited him to visit the ROC in the second half of this year.</P>
      <P>Hu will travel to Malawi on Tuesday for a three-day visit as
part of his effort to cement the ROC's relations with the
southeastern African ally.</P>

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A truck filled with SDRAM (synchronous
dynamic random access memory), one of the most widely used microchips
in the digital industry, was hijacked in broad daylight Monday
outside a company in the Hsinchu Science-based Industrial Park.</P>
      <P>The SDRAM, worth over NT$170 million (US$5 million), was loaded
in a freight company truck that was taking the chips to the airport
for transport to customers in Japan and Germany.</P>
      <P>Huang Yun-chang, the 25-year-old truck driver, told police that
about 8:55 a.m., only a few minutes after he picked up the cargo from
United Test Center (UTC) Inc. in Taiwan's silicon valley, five men
dressed as police ordered him to pull over, shouting, "This is the
police!" and "Security check!"</P>
      <P>The driver said that after he stopped, one of the men dragged him
into a sedan that had been following his truck, and that two of the
other robbers took off in the truck.</P>
      <P>Huang was blindfolded and then driven to an isolated rural area,
where he was left stranded.</P>
      <P>Police located the truck in Chutung township, near Hsinchu city,
around noon Tuesday. A small portion of the cargo was found inside.</P>
      <P>A UTC spokesman didn't rule out the possibility of an inside job,
noting that few people knew the chips -- which were tailor-made for
notebook computer makers in Japan and Germany -- were to be delivered
Monday, the first working day after the Chinese New Year holiday.</P>
      <P>He said the robbers were clever and well-prepared, and that they
probably knew the chips they made off with could be used in almost
any PC manufacturing plant.</P>
      <P>Police have been on high alert since noon Monday, particularly at
Chiang Kai-shek International Airport, suspecting the robbers may try
to smuggle the chips to buyers overseas.</P>

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's top liaison official in Hong
Kong on Monday renewed his call for the creation of a more efficient
and effective communication mechanism between Taiwan and Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>Cheng An-kuo, managing director of the Chung Hwa Travel Service,
the Republic of China's representative office in Hong Kong, admitted
that Taiwan-Hong Kong relations have improved since the former
British territory's reversion to mainland Chinese rule on July 1,
1997, citing that he can communicate directly with Hong Kong Chief
Executive Tung Chee-hwa's special advisor Yip Kuo-hwa.</P>
      <P>He said, however, that relations between Taiwan and Hong Kong are
less close than he had expected they would become.</P>
      <P>Citing figures showing two-way trade between the two areas
reached US$29 billion in 1997 and that Taiwan residents made 1.64
million visits to Hong Kong last year, he argued that the two sides
should have a smoother and more effective mechanism for communicating
with each other.</P>
      <P>His remarks, made during an interview with a Hong Kong radio

    <HEADLINE>MOODY'S DENIES DOWNGRADING OF TAIWAN BANKS' RATINGS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New  York,  Feb.  2  (CNA)
(By Jane-jane Huang and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Moody's Investors Service, one of the
world's two leading credit rating companies, on Monday denied
a foreign wire service report that Moody's has downgraded its credit
ratings for 10 major Taiwan banks.</P>
      <P>"The report was erroneous," Jerome S. Fones, a senior Moody's
executive, said, adding that the performance of Taiwan's banking
sector remains good compared with its Asian counterparts.</P>
      <P>Fones said the company issued an "outlook report" on Taiwan's
banking institutions on Jan. 27. "The report was not a credit rating
report. It was mainly aimed at reminding investors of possible
changes in Taiwan's financial situation in the wake of the recent
Asian financial turmoil," he explained.</P>
      <P>Fones further said the credit ratings of the 10 Taiwan banks
mentioned in the Moody's "outlook report" have remained unchanged.</P>
      <P>In its "outlook report," the Moody's revised its rating outlook
for Taiwan's banking sector to "negative" from "stable" because
"there is heightened vulnerability of the sector to the ongoing
economic crisis in Asia" and due to resulting risks linked to
pressures on the New Taiwan dollar.</P>
      <P>"These factors could impact the highly leveraged corporate sector
and ultimately affect the asset quality of the banks," the Moody's
report said.</P>
      <P>According to the report, the Taiwan banks to be affected
included Bank of Taiwan, Bank SinoPac, Chang Hwa Commercial Bank,
Chiao Tung Bank, Hua Nan Commercial Bank, Chinatrust Commercial
Bank, E. Sun Bank, First Commercial Bank, the International
Commercial Bank of China and the United World Chinese Commercial
Bank.</P>
      <P>However, Fones said, this doesn't mean that these Taiwan banks
will face an impending downgrading of their credit ratings.</P>
      <P>If necessary, Fones said, the Moody's will form a special task
force to further investigate the credit status of Taiwan's financial
institutions. Relevant Taiwan banks can provide related data or
documents within three months for Moody's reference. "We would then
decide whether to adjust our credit ratings for relevant Taiwan
banks."</P>
      <P>But to date, Fones said, the Moody's has no plans to form such a
panel to look into Taiwan banks' credit situation. "We have no
timetable for such a plan," he added.</P>
      <P>Generally speaking, Fones said, most Taiwan banks perform fairly
well and are highly efficient. In contrast, the performance of many
mainland Chinese banks are rated "poor" by the Moody's.</P>
      <P>US-based Moody's is one of the world's two largest credit rating
institutions. Its rating reports consistently have a significant
impact on general investment activities of investors around the
world. For instance, the stock markets in South Korea and
Indonesia tumbled substantially shortly after Moody's rated corporate
bonds issued by some South Korean and Indonesia banks and companies
as "junk bonds" last month.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOST ASIAN STOCK MARKETS POST DOUBLE-DIGIT GAINS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  Feb. 3 (CNA)
(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Asian financial markets greeted the Year
of the Tiger with a roar Monday, clawing back some of the losses
incurred over the past few months.</P>
      <P>The Indonesian rupiah led a widespread recovery of Asian
currencies as markets gave the thumbs-up to reforms introduced by
Indonesia last week.</P>
      <P>Most major Asian stock markets followed suit with double-digit
gains -- led by the Hong Kong bourse, with the Hang Seng Index rising
14.3 percent to 10,578.60 points, The Straits Times said in an
analysis Tuesday.</P>
      <P>In Singapore, the Straits Times Industrials Index posted the
biggest single-day gain in its 25-year history, rising 173.07 points
to close at 1,432.99 points.</P>
      <P>The Singapore dollar, however, ceded some of its gains last
Friday. At the close of Asian trade Monday, it was trading at
S$1.7185 to the US dollar, weaker than Friday's S$1.7170.</P>
      <P>The rupiah surged 28 percent to 9,750 to the US dollar before
weakening to 10,275. Frenzied buying added a hefty 68.17 points or 14
percent to the Jakarta Composite Index, which closed at 554.11
points.</P>
      <P>In Thailand, the baht closed 5.6 percent higher at 50.88 to the
US dollar, while the benchmark SET Index rose 12 percent to 554.75
points.</P>
      <P>Last Friday, Thailand lifted controls on the baht which were
introduced last year in a futile attempt to prevent speculators from
attacking the currency further.</P>
      <P>In the Philippines, the peso rose 3.7 percent to close at 41.30
to the US dollar. The Philippine bourse also registered a 10.2
percent gain to close at 2,145.70 points.</P>
      <P>South Korea's Composite Index shed earlier gains, losing 4.2
percent to 543.68 points.</P>
      <P>Regional sentiment was buoyed Monday by South Korea's
restructuring of US$24 billion worth of short-term debts and
Thailand's scrapping of its two-tier system for baht trading, said
analysts here.</P>
      <P>Foreign institutions were involved heavily in mopping up stocks
across Asia, they said. They bought up mainly blue-chip banking and
property stocks.</P>
      <P>Last week, the Indonesian government announced a slew of
confidence-boosting measures such as a temporary freeze on corporate
debt repayments, the opening up of local banks to foreign acquisition
as well as committees to deal with the country's US$65 billion
corporate debt.</P>
      <P>The declaration of a voluntary corporate debt moratorium, coupled
with the implementation of a host of market-friendly measures, should
boost the rupiah substantially in the near term, said an Asian
markets researcher.</P>
      <P>But some analysts warned that it was still too early to say if
Asia's fortunes had changed for the better, citing the specter of
"real economic pains" like inflation and unemployment, the report
said.</P>
      <P>Indonesia, for example, announced a higher set of inflation
figures Monday, analysts said. Rising prices of food and basic
commodities are likely to spark social unrest, they warned.</P>
      <P>And even though South Korea delayed payment of its short-term
debt, it still has more than US$50 billion due over the next 12
months, they added.</P>

      <P>Hong Kong Bank of Canada is the largest foreign bank in Canada.
NatWest Canada, which had its parent company in Britain, employs 32

(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's Chinatrust Commercial Bank is
making an ambitious approach to buy a slice of the Bangkok Bank as a
stepping stone to the wider world, according to an Australian daily.</P>
      <P>In a report Tuesday, the mass circulation newspaper The
Australian reported Chinatrust's Chairman Jeffrey L.S. Koo is
planning to take a slice of the Bangkok Bank, Thailand's largest
bank, in order to give him access to the tremendous cash flows of
Thailand's ethnic Chinese business community.</P>
      <P>The daily's Asia business editor, Geoff Hiscock, said the timing
of Koo's ambition to enter the Thai financial market is good because
it is relatively cheap to buy a stake in the Bangkok Bank now.</P>
      <P>Bangkok Bank is owned by Chatri Sophonpanich, an old friend of
Koo.</P>
      <P>Chatri Sophonpanich earlier told the Nation newspaper that the
Bangkok Bank wanted to raise additional capital of up to 25 billion
Thai baht (US$465 million) and planned to lift the limit foreign
investors could hold in the company from the current 25 percent to 45
percent.</P>
      <P>The daily reported the Bangkok Bank traded around 95 baht per
share on Monday, well below its one year high of 193 baht in March
1997.</P>
      <P>The daily also reported Koo might be negotiating to buy up to a
20 percent stake in the Bangkok Bank at a cost of around US$300
million.</P>
      <P>Chinatrust, with assets of US$15.5 billion, is now one of the top
10 banks in Taiwan, according to the daily. It has several branches

    <HEADLINE>AUSTRALIA'S TRADE DEFICIT HITS 2.5 YEAR HIGH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Feb.  3  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia, hit by the Asian economic
crisis, suffered a trade deficit of A$880 million (US$599 million) in
December 1997, the highest monthly deficit in two and a half years,
as a result of rising imports, according to the Australian Bureau of
Statistics (ABS).</P>
      <P>This compared to a trade surplus of A$509 million in November.</P>
      <P>ABS officials attributed the sudden rise of Australia's deficit
to a 12.1 percent rise of imports of goods and services in December,
the biggest increase of imports in almost 10 years.</P>
      <P>The A$880 million deficit surprised the financial market, which
considerably dumped the Australian dollar, causing the currency to
fall, closing at 68.18 US cents Monday, down from 68.40 US cents last
Friday.</P>
      <P>Federal Treasurer Peter Costello, however, moved quickly on
Monday to calm jittery markets, noting that the deficit was largely
due to the strength of the domestic economy.</P>
      <P>"It's probably too early to say that this reflects the impact of
Asia. What the figures are demonstrating is the strengthening of
domestic demand," he told reporters.</P>
      <P>But economists, who only expected a trade deficit of A$50 million
in December, warned that the larger-than-expected deficit could widen
Australia's current account deficit because they believe the Asian
crisis has finally begun to take its toll on the country's export
performance.</P>
      <P>"The mix of strong internal demand and weakening external demand
is a very unfavorable one for the current account deficit outlook,"
said Peter Osborne of the Merrill Lynch Equities (Australia).</P>
      <P>Costello also admitted that the current account deficit remains a
problem for Australia.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NEW THERAPY MAY OFFER HOPE TO CANCER PATIENTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New  York,  Feb.  2  (CNA)
(By David Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Long Island doctors have entered the
future of cancer care by inserting working copies of a
tumor-suppressing gene into a 55-year-old man to help counteract
liver cancer.</P>
      <P>Known as gene therapy, the technique can be used against dozens
of hereditary disorders but provides new roadways into the molecular
mechanisms that seed and drive the development of cancer.</P>
      <P>Liver cancer is a key gene-therapy target, Newsday quoted doctors
as saying Monday, because 80 percent to 90 percent of cases involve
mutant or missing "p53" genes. The hope is that getting healthy
copies of p53 into chromosomes of cancer cells will help suppress the
rampant cellular proliferation characteristic of the disease.</P>
      <P>Overall, according to Newsday, a mass-circulation New York daily,
researchers believe that replacing p53 holds promise in 50 percent of
all human tumors.</P>
      <P>William Watrous, a retired elementary school teacher, received
laboratory-engineered versions of p53 on Jan. 22 at North Shore
University Hospital in Manhasset. The genes, carried in deactivated
adenoviruses -- the viruses that cause the common cold--were injected
through his liver's main artery, allowing the bloodstream to
distribute the molecular packages to the four inoperable tumors that
have invaded the organ.</P>
      <P>Immediately afterward, Watrous felt some discomfort but says he's
happy he made the decision. "It's the only hope I have," he
explained. "There were no cures on the market for me."</P>
      <P>Last Tuesday, during his first examination after the procedure,
all appeared to be going well, his doctors said. Still, only time
will tell whether the genes enter tumor cells, as they're supposed
to, and switch off growth.</P>
      <P>The hope is that the new genes will produce a protein that leads
to apoptosis, or cell death, within the tumors, helping to shrink
them.</P>
      <P>The procedure, the first in what North Shore doctors hope will be
a long line of genetic studies conducted there, was part of a Phase 1
trial. Generally, Phase 1 trials examine a drug's toxicity. Later, in
other trials, scientists will study dosage and effectiveness</P>
      <P>Gene therapy has long been one of the futuristic dreams of
medicine. But clinical results aren't always in lockstep with
scientific theory, researchers say, and there have been mixed results
in many studies using gene therapy during the past 10 years.</P>

      <P>Australia's wool industry is suffering
sharp declines in its exports to major markets, including Taiwan,
South Korea, Japan, mainland China and Hong Kong, according to the
Australian Council of Wool Exporters (ACWE).</P>
      <P>An ACWE spokesman said the wool market has started to deteriorate

      <P>He said 1998 will be a difficult year for the Australian wool
industry.</P>

expressed "deep concern" with the gravity of the Asian situation.</P>
      <P>The South Korean market, the sixth largest for the Australian
wool industry, has been lost for an indefinite period, he said,
adding that sales to Taiwan plunged by 31 percent in the first five
months of 1997-98 compared to the same period in the previous fiscal
year.</P>
      <P>Exports to Japan also dropped 26 percent, and both mainland China

      <P>Malaysia's English-language Sun daily quoted Anwar's personal

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  3  (CNA)
(By Lin Wen-fen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Ho Ming-teh, winner of the 1995 Ramon
Magsaysay Award for community leadership, died at the age of 77 on
Sunday night at his home in Chiayi County, southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Ho, a prolific bridge builder in central and southern Taiwan, was
hospitalized on Jan. 27, the eve of the Chinese New Year, because of
chronic liver disease. He returned home on Sunday morning and passed
away that night, his family said.</P>
      <P>Ho received the Ramon Magsaysay Award in 1995 for his selfless
dedication to "improving rural Taiwan through good deeds and sturdy
bridges," making him the ninth Republic of China citizen to receive
the prestigious award, named after a popular Philippine president who
died in a plane crash in 1957.</P>
      <P>Ho and other volunteers built their first bridge in June 1971
after a flood took the lives of two young brothers on their way to
school. Since then, more than 200,000 supporters have contributed to
the Ho-founded Chiayi Philanthropy Group, either financially or in
the form of volunteer labor in the construction of the bridges.</P>
      <P>Over the past 27 years, the group has built a total of 228
bridges in remote rural areas of central and southern Taiwan, with
another two bridges currently under construction.</P>
      <P>The bridges built by the group, ranging from 6 meters to 160
meters in length, have all stood firm since their completion, strong
enough to brave the typhoons that sweep Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN FIRM DENIES CHARGES OF INDUSTRIAL ESPIONAGE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 3 (CNA)
(By Bear Lee)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Nanya Technology Corp. (NTC) on Tuesday
denied reports on its involvement in an industrial espionage case in
South Korea.</P>
      <P>According to a CNA dispatch from Seoul, South Korean prosecutors
said they have arrested 16 people on charges of stealing top secret
semiconductor technology for producing 64 megabit dynamic random
access memory (DRAM) chips from Samsung Electronics Co. and LG
Electronics Co. and selling it to NTC.</P>
      <P>South Korea is the largest producer of memory chips in the world,
accounting for 30 percent of the world market.</P>
      <P>Seoul prosecution officials said that Kim Hyong-ik, a former
Samsung researcher, set up Korea Semiconductor Technology Co. (KSTC)
in Seoul in 1997 and has received monthly payments of US$100,000 from
NTC in exchange for technology it has stolen from Samsung and LG.</P>
      <P>NTC, a subsidiary of the Formosa Group, one of the largest
conglomerates in Taiwan, said however that it has found no evidence
of wrongdoing regarding its cooperation program with KSTC.</P>
      <P>NTC said in a statement that under the terms of the agreement it
signed with KSTC in September, 1997, KSTC was to send engineers to
NTC to jointly explore technology for making a new generation of
semiconductors.</P>
      <P>To show its respect for intellectual property rights, NTC
specifically asked KSTC to give its assurance that it would not
supply unauthorized information or secrets belonging to others while
developing the new technology.</P>
      <P>"So far we have found no evidence of violation of the agreement
by KSTC, and we will absolutely terminate the contract if any such
evidence is found," the NTC statement added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, officials with the ROC Ministry of Economic Affairs
refused to comment on the reports, saying that Taiwan is capable of
developing the technology for making 64 megabit DRAM chips without
outside help.</P>
      <P>Industrial sources said that aside from NTC, at least five other
Taiwan firms will begin mass production of 64 megabit DRAM chips this
year.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan lags behind South Korea and Japan in 64 megabit
DRAM chip technology, it's very likely that the island will catch up
by the end of this year, the sources said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOST ASIAN STOCK MARKETS POST DOUBLE-DIGIT GAINS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  Feb. 3 (CNA)
(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Asian financial markets greeted the Year
of the Tiger with a roar yesterday, clawing back some of the losses
incurred over the past few months.</P>
      <P>The Indonesian rupiah led a wide-spread recovery of Asian
currencies as markets gave the thumbs-up to reforms introduced by
Indonesia last week.</P>
      <P>Most major Asian stock markets followed suit with double-digit
gains -- led by the Hongkong bourse, where the Hang Seng Index rose
14.3 per cent to 10,578.60 points, The Straits Times said in a
round-up analysis report in today's edition.</P>
      <P>In Singapore, the Straits Times Industrials Index posted its
biggest single-day gain in its 25-year history, rising 173.07 points
to close at 1,432.99 points.</P>
      <P>The Singapore dollar, however, ceded some of its gains last
Friday. At the close of Asian trade yesterday, it was trading at
S$1.7185 to the US dollar, weaker than Friday's S$1.7170.</P>
      <P>The rupiah surges 28 per cent to 9,750 to the US dollar before
weakening to 10,275. Frenzied buying added a hefty 68.17 points or 14
per cent to the Jakarta Composite Index, which closed at 554.11
points.</P>
      <P>In Thailand, the baht closed 5.6 per cent higher at 50.88 to the
US dollar, while the bench-mark SET Index rose 12 per cent to 554.75
points.</P>
      <P>Last Friday, Thailand lifted controls on the baht which were
introduced last year in a futile attempt to prevent speculators from
attacking the currency further.</P>
      <P>In the Philippines, the peso rose 3.7 per cent to close at 41.30
to the US dollar. The Philippine bourse also registered a 10.2 per
cent gain to close at 2,145.70 points.</P>
      <P>South Korea's Composite Index shed earlier gains, losing 4.2 per
cent to 543.68 points.</P>
      <P>Regional sentiment was buoyed yesterday by South Korea's
restructuring of US$24 billion worth of short-term debts and
Thailand's scrapping of its two-tier system for baht trading, said
analysts here.</P>
      <P>Foreign institutions were involved heavily in mopping up stocks
across Asia, they said. They bought up mainly blue-chip banking and
property stocks.</P>
      <P>Last week, the Indonesian government announced a slew
of confidence-boosting measures such as a temporary freeze on
corporate debt repayments, the opening up of local banks to foreign
acquisition as well as committees to deal with the country's US$65
billion corporate debt.</P>
      <P>The declaration of a voluntary corporate debt moratorium, coupled
with the implementation of a host of market- friendly measures,
should boost the rupiah substantially in the near term, said an Asian
markets researcher.</P>
      <P>But some analysts warned that it was still too early to say if
Asia's fortunes had turned for the better, citing the specter of
"real economic pains" like inflation and unemployment, the report
said.</P>
      <P>Indonesia, for example, announced a higher set of inflation
figures yesterday, analysts said. Rising prices of food and basic
commodities are likely to spark social unrest, they warned.</P>
      <P>And even though Suth Korea had delayed payment of its short-term
debt, it still had more than US$50 billion due over the next 12
months, they added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>THINK-TANK ADJUSTS GROWTH DOWNWARD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  4  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Affected by the Asian financial turmoil
which has challenged global economies over the last few months,
Taiwan's economic growth is expected to go slower than expected,
reaching only 6.25 percent in 1998, rather than the 6.45 percent
predicted earlier, the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research (TIER)
reported on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>According to TIER President Wu Jung-yi, despite the volatile
economic situation in the Asia-Pacific region, Taiwan can still
manage to maintain an overall economic growth of more than 6 percent
this year, due to its solid foreign exchange reserves, low foreign
debts, and steadily growing foreign trade.</P>
      <P>Researchers at the private economic think-tank predicted that
Taiwan's economy will grow 6.16 percent in the first quarter of this
year, and 5.97 percent, 6.06 percent and 6.78 percent in the second,
third and fourth quarters, respectively.</P>
      <P>The TIER forecast that investment from the private sector will
reach its apex this year, with total private investment reaching
NT$408.2 billion (US$12.37 billion), up a whopping 36 percent over
the figure for 1997.</P>
      <P>Public investment from the government sector, however, is
expected to diminish to post negative growth of 0.09 percent as a
result of the increase in the number of BOT (build, operate and
transfer) projects, the think-tank said.</P>
      <P>Even though the New Taiwan dollar has depreciated substantially
over the last several months, consumption from Taiwan's private
sector will continue to pick up steam this year under the favorable
economic climate, which includes the implementation of a five-day
work week and a sustained boom in exports. Private consumption is
expected to grow 7.06 percent this year, the researchers predicted.</P>
      <P>The TIER also forecast that Taiwan's currency, which depreciated
some 20 percent in late 1997, will fluctuate at an average annual
rate of around NT$32 to the greenback this year as the economies in
the region gradually stabilize.</P>
      <P>The New Taiwan dollar posted an average annual rate of 28.7
against the US dollar in 1997.</P>

      <P>Facing accusations of infringing upon the
patent right of the EMI Group, Winbond Electronics Corp., one of
Taiwan's largest manufacturers of semiconductors, stressed Wednesday
in Taipei that they have never committed any such infringement.</P>
      <P>A Winbond spokesman told the press that his company always
conducts thorough investigations into every new product, to prevent
possible patent infringements, saying that the company's cautious and
careful measures make it impossible for Winbond to violate the
intellectual property rights of other firms.</P>
      <P>The spokesman added that Winbond will spare no effort in gaining
in-depth knowledge of the case before taking proper steps to deal
with it.</P>
      <P>The EMI Group's American affiliate based in the US state of

firms in the United States of infringing upon two of their patent
rights relating to semiconductor technology.</P>
      <P>The EMI Group, which utilizes multiple technologies to support a
wide range of products including video, voice and data services, is
listed as the largest musical publisher in the United Kingdom.</P>
      <P>This is the second accusation of patent right infringement

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Central Standing Committee of the ruling
Kuomintang (KMT) on Wednesday approved a new package of personnel
nominations which will shape the new Cabinet led by Premier Vincent
Siew, who was sworn in just four months ago.</P>
      <P>ROC President and KMT Chairman Lee Teng-hui urged all party
members to render their full support to the premier in the wake of
the reshuffle.</P>
      <P>In the reshuffle, Legislator and KMT Central Policy Coordination
Committee Vice Executive Director Huang Chu-wen replaced Yeh
Chin-feng as interior minister. Yeh, meanwhile, accepted a KMT
invitation to be a vice secretary-general of the ruling party.</P>
      <P>Lin Ching-chiang, a member of the Examination Yuan and former
president of National Chung Cheng University, replaced Wu Jin as
education minister. Wu enjoyed the highest poll ratings among the old
Cabinet, despite his whimsical ideas about education reforms which
often drew fire from critics.</P>
      <P>Wu turned down the KMT's offer of a position as a minister of
state in the new Cabinet, insisting instead on returning to teach at
National Cheng Kung University, where he was president before being
recruited into the Cabinet some 20 months ago by Lee Teng-hui.</P>
      <P>Chiao Jen-ho, secretary-general of the Straits Exchange

    <HEADLINE>MAINLAND CHINESE MILITARY EXPANDS INFLUENCE ON TAIWAN AFFAIRS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  4  (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Military leaders of mainland China have
expanded their influence on Taiwan affairs, in the fields of both
policy making and military exercises, exposing Beijing's two-sided
approach to war and peace, observed the Department of Mainland
Operations (DMO) of the Republic of China's ruling Kuomintang (KMT).</P>
      <P>An article in the biweekly journal of the DMO points out that
military leaders in mainland China tried to persuade the Beijing
authorities recently to let the military have a bigger say in the
sphere of diplomatic and Taiwan affairs. In order to improve the
support of the military, mainland China's president Jiang Zemin is
considering granting a bigger role to the military in those spheres,
according to the biweekly.</P>
      <P>In an analysis of the DMO's research, several facts are cited as
evidence of the bigger role the mainland Chinese military is playing
in terms of policy making toward Taiwan and other relevant matters.</P>
      <P>One of the most important of these is that Zhang Wannian, vice
chairman of the Central Military Commission of the Communist Party of
China (CPC), advocates resolving the "Taiwan problem" by 2020.</P>
      <P>In addition, it is rumored that the role of the "Central Taiwan
Affairs Leading Group" may be promoted to a higher level by taking
senior leaders and members of the CPC's Central Military Commission
into its fold.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AUSTRALIA  TO  LAUNCH  TOURIST PROMOTIONAL DRIVES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Feb.  4  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia, hit by declining numbers of
tourist arrivals, will launch a A$5 million promotional blitz in
Taiwan, Hong Kong, South Korea and four other Asian countries in a
bid to lure Asian tourists, the Australian Tourist Commission (ATC)
announced on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>In a statement faxed to the CNA, ATC managing director John Morse
said the campaign "is designed to deliver a strong message of
Australia's price competitiveness and affordability to Asian
consumers."</P>
      <P>"The ATC recognizes that there is a need to re-evaluate our
strategies and become even more aggressive in our approach, given the
current circumstances. We have developed a modified regional strategy
to minimize the effects of the economic crisis on the Australian
industry, and build business immediately," he said.</P>
      <P>Asian tourists from Taiwan, Thailand and other countries either
showed a decline or the growth of their numbers dropped due to the
Asian economic crisis and the racial debate triggered by Independent
Member of Parliament Pauline Hanson.</P>
      <P>Morse said: "The campaign, to be launched in seven countries
across Asia (Hong Kong, Singapore, Korea, Indonesia, Malaysia, Taiwan
and Thailand) at the end of February, will run through until the end
of June this year, and is aimed at generating traffic to Australia
now."</P>
      <P>"The timing of the campaign, scheduled to kick off after the
Chinese New Year, is strategically aimed at generating a quick
response during a period which the ACT knows will see the real
impacts of the currency changes begin to kick in," he added.</P>
      <P>Morse said Asian tourists have become a major market for the
rising tourist industry in Australia.</P>
      <P>In 1991, Australia attracted less than 400,000 visitors from
Asian countries. By 1997, the figure had skyrocketed to about 1.3
million.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DROP IN AIDS DEATHS IN NEW YORK</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New  York,  Feb.  3  (CNA)
(By David Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The number of New York City residents
dying of AIDS plummeted by a dramatic 48 percent last year from 1996,
dropping to just 2,600, the lowest it's been in more than 10 years.</P>
      <P>It is the second consecutive substantial drop recorded by the New
York City Health Department. Last year, the health department
reported that deaths had dropped by 29 percent, from 7,046 deaths in
1995 to 4,944 in 1996.</P>
      <P>The decrease follows the introduction of new, effective forms of
treatment in 1995. But it also comes as the number of Americans
becoming newly infected with HIV annually remains stable.</P>
      <P>The good news is that many people infected with HIV can expect to
live far longer than did their counterparts just three years ago. The
bad news, experts said, is that the pool of Americans who are
surviving thanks to costly and sometimes toxic combinations of drugs
will continue to grow for years because thousands more Americans are
contracting HIV every day.</P>
      <P>As a result, the costs and burdens associated with sophisticated
HIV treatment -- amounting to US$25,000 to US$60,000 a year per
patient -- can be expected to swell dramatically.</P>
      <P>The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta
reported on Tuesday that national figures for deaths from AIDS were
also on the decrease. 12,040 Americans died of AIDS in the first half
of 1997, compared with 21,460 in the first half of 1996, a 44-percent
decrease. The total nationwide figures for last year will not be
tallied until July.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a second species of AIDS virus, designated HIV-2, has
surfaced in New York City, according to the New York City Department
of Health.</P>
      <P>Making a presentation on Tuesday at the fifth Conference on
Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections in Chicago, Dr. Sara
Beatrice of the health department said that because New York City has
a large African population, it has long been suspected that HIV-2,
which is almost exclusively seen in West Africa, might be present in
the city.</P>
      <P>In West Africa, HIV-2 is less virulent than HIV-1. It causes
AIDS, but far more slowly, over the course of 20 to 40 years.
Nationwide to date, the CDC has identified 75 HIV-2 cases.</P>

      <P>Northern Telecom (Nortel) of Canada on
Tuesday launched a new business unit on Enterprise Data Networks
which will focus on delivering high-performance data networks
globally.</P>
      <P>F. William Conner was named president of the new line of business
designed to help carry out the company's "Webtone" project.</P>
      <P>John Roth, Nortel president and chief executive officer, has put
forward a goal of becoming the world's top manufacturer of "Webtone"
networks -- Internet networks that offer the same ease of use and
reliability as telephone "dialtone" networks.</P>
      <P>Nortel has been building data networks for businesses and
communications carriers for more than twenty years. In 1997, Nortel's
revenue from data and multimedia communications products was US$785
million.</P>
      <P>"As corporations increase their use of the Internet and intranets
for communicating with customers, suppliers and employees, new data
network requirements are forming. Our vision for Webtone, in which
customers will be able to rely on the Internet with the same sense of
trust and security as they do with their voice networks, is designed
to meet those requirements," said Roth.</P>
      <P>Enterprise Data Networks are targeted at three customer groups --
global businesses with sophisticated networking requirements, and
general business markets with multipurpose networking needs. In
addition, it will continue to offer next generation data networking
infrastructures to carriers and service providers.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Aggressively lowering blood cholesterol
levels does not lead to a greater reduction in the risk of heart
attack, according to an expert from Scotland's University of Glasgow.</P>
      <P>On a visit to Melbourne, Dr. Allan Gaw said his seven-year
findings could overturn the conventional wisdom that the less fat in
your veins, the better for your heart.</P>
      <P>He said the research is the first in the world to chart the
relationship between lowering cholesterol and reducing the risk of
heart attack.</P>
      <P>The research looked into the effects of a new generation
cholesterol drug called pravastatin on 6,550 men who had raised
cholesterol levels but had never had a heart attack.</P>
      <P>He said the research found that men who dropped their blood
cholesterol by up to 20 percent reduced the chance of their having a
heart attack by one third.</P>
      <P>But there was no additional reduction in the risk of heart attack
for the men who dropped their cholesterol levels by a greater amount,
he said.</P>
      <P>He said he hoped his research would convince specialists to
change the way they "look at lowering cholesterol" in patients, by
placing a greater emphasis on lifestyle factors, including patients'

      <P>The first communications satellite
jointly owned by the Republic of China and Singapore, ST-1, will be
launched on the French-built Ariane 4 rocket in French Guiana in May
this year.</P>
      <P>The US$220-million satellite is owned jointly by the Singapore
Telecommunication Corp. and the Chunghwa Telecommunication Co. of the
ROC, The Straits Times reported on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The two companies signed an agreement in 1995 to commission
Anglo-French firm Matra Marconi Space to build ST-1, which will
support video-broadcasting, telephone and data services, the report
said.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for Aerospatiale's Space and Defense Branch told
Singapore reporters during a briefing this week at its rocket
production facility in Les Mureaux, just outside Paris: "ST-1 will be
the 109th satellite to be launched by an Ariane 4 rocket. It is
scheduled to take off at the end of May or in early June."</P>
      <P>The Aerospatiale Group, with 38,000 employees and sales of US$10

      <P>The same type of experts who failed to
forecast the Asian meltdown last year at a World Economic Forum
session now predict the worst is over for Asia, a Canadian columnist
said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>In a dispatch from Davos, Switzerland, Diane Francis of The

investors.</P>
      <P>"The bad news is plans by Asians to export themselves back to

of their Latin American and Eastern European neighbors this year,"
she added.</P>
      <P>Worse yet, Francis pointed out, a rapid recovery by Asia based on
exports could sow the seeds for future crises if it creates a US

      <P>A policy of protectionism by the US would have dire consequences
for the global economy, she quoted the experts as saying.</P>
      <P>She observed that the fear of a flood of exports is not

      <P>Singapore has the highest standards of
corporate governance in Asia, well ahead of Japan and Hong Kong,
according to global consultancy firm Price Waterhouse.</P>
      <P>The Republic of China was bottom of the list of countries
surveyed, in terms of standards of corporate governance.</P>
      <P>A survey of 75 listed companies conducted with support from the
Stock Exchange of Singapore showed that companies in Singapore feel
the quality of local rules is well ahead of other Asian economies, it
said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>"This confirms the view expressed by world economic and political
leaders recently that Singapore is best placed in Asia to regain
international confidence in its business affairs and bounce back from
the current regional downturn," a Price Waterhouse statement quoted a

Singapore still does not approach the best international standards --

hectares are for public housing, with the remaining land being used
for more than one dozen other purposes.</P>
      <P>Taisugar was quoted as saying that it agreed to release the

    <DATELINE>Singapore,  Feb.  4  (CNA)
(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong
announced in Jakarta on Tuesday night a Singapore initiative to help
Indonesia "unlock" part of its international financial crisis -- a
scheme involving several countries that would guarantee payment for
Indonesian imports, The Straits Times reported on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The proposal, which he discussed with Indonesian President
Suharto during a 95-minute meeting, could, if accepted, provide the
Indonesian Central Bank with up to US$20 billion in foreign
guarantees, Goh said.</P>
      <P>Goh was in Jakarta for an overnight visit -- his second so far
this year.</P>
      <P>"Letters of credit issued by Indonesian banks are not being
accepted by foreign banks. We have to unlock this. If we do not
unlock this, LCs are not accepted, imports cannot go in," Goh said
after his meeting with Suharto.</P>
      <P>The Indonesian government announced last week that it would
guarantee all deposits and debts of Indonesian banks, but many
foreign banks are still not accepting their letters of credit, the
report said. Analysts said even some of the big banks in Jakarta had
been using customers' deposits to cover other obligations and
delaying payment to LC holders.</P>
      <P>There were two ways out of this dilemma, Goh noted. One was for
individual countries to provide guarantees to their own banks that
exports to Indonesia would be paid for.</P>
      <P>A multilateral forum would be "more flexible", Goh said. It would
take a little more time to implement compared to a bilateral
agreement, but if only eight countries joined the consortium and put
up US$1 billion each, there would be US$8 billion for Indonesian
imports "straight away."</P>
      <P>Indonesian authorities, with central bank reserves currently at
around US$20 billion, have long said that the amount would be good
for five months' worth of imports, the report said.</P>
      <P>Suharto said he welcomed the multilateral scheme, the report
said.</P>
      <P>He said Australia had already agreed to guarantee Indonesian
imports of certain commodities, as had the United States.</P>
      <P>"I believe that we will be able to restore the economy," he

    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Feb. 4 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Asian economic turmoil is expected to
cut the export growth rate of Australia's commodities to the region
but also raise the prospect of a new trade war between Canberra and
Washington as a result of an aggressive US drive to sell more grain
and other agricultural produce.</P>
      <P>The warning was made by Dr. Brain Fisher, executive director of
the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics (ABARE)
at the Outlook 1998 conference in Canberra on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>He said Australia's commodities exports in 1997-98 would only
rise 1.2 percent to a record high of A$64 billion, compared to the
1996-97 level. But the rise is small, compared to the original
forecast of 4.2 percent.</P>
      <P>He said Australia will face difficulty for the next decade
because of the Asian currency crisis, which has generated more
uncertainty than any world event since the collapse of the Soviet
Union.</P>
      <P>He said sharp declines in foreign exchange, property and equity
markets combined with fragile banking systems and higher interest
rates in the financially troubled Asian economies were expected to
make a significant impact on Australia's short-term economic growth.</P>
      <P>To make matters worse, he said evidence is surfacing that the US
is aggressively trying to grab commodity markets in Asia by helping
American farm exporters through its export guarantee funding.</P>
      <P>The US is targeting Indonesia's imports of 38 percent of the
Australian cotton crop, offering credit terms Australia could not
match, according to Primary Industries Minister John Anderson.</P>
      <P>The Australian officials said the US is also trying to grab the
other Australian commodities markets in Asia through similar schemes.</P>
      <P>Anderson said Australia would call on the World Trade
Organization to police US trade credit terms as low as two or three
percent over 30 years.</P>
      <P>He said the US practices were "not quite cricket" in terms of
trying to attract business with extensive credit.</P>
      <P>He said Australia intends to target the architect of the US Asian
credit strategy, US Agricultural Secretary Dan Glickman, at a meeting
of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in Paris
next month.</P>
      <P>He said Glickman has sent US officials to Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur,
Jakarta, Hong Kong, Seoul and Tokyo recently to "help banks and
importers understand" the program of the US$2 billion in export
credit guarantees the US has made available to the region and "to be
on hand to troubleshoot should any wrinkles in our assistance crop
up."</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN FIRM AGAIN DENIES CHARGES OF INDUSTRIAL ESPIONAGE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  4   (CNA)
(By Bear Lee)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Nanya Technology Corp. (NTC) on
Wednesday again denied purchasing technology allegedly stolen from a
South Korean high-tech firm.</P>
      <P>NTC President Chuang Yen-shan said that NTC has had no more than
a cooperative relationship with the Korea Semiconductor Technology
Co. (KSTC) -- the South Korean company reportedly behind the
industrial espionage case -- and has not spent even a single penny to
purchase other companies' top secrets.</P>
      <P>According to news reports from Seoul, South Korean prosecutors
have arrested 16 people on charges of stealing top-secret
semiconductor technology for producing 64 megabit dynamic random
access memory (DRAM) chips from Samsung Electronics Co. and LG
Electronics Co. and selling it to NTC.</P>
      <P>South Korea is the largest producer of memory chips in the world,
holding 30 percent of the global market.</P>
      <P>Seoul prosecution officials said that Kim Hyong-ik, a former
Samsung researcher, set up KSTC in Seoul in 1997 and has received
monthly payments of US$100,000 from NTC in exchange for technology
his company stole from Samsung and LG.</P>
      <P>Chuang said at a press conference that KSTC approached NTC last
May or June about forging cooperative ties and that the two companies
subsequently signed an agreement on the joint development of new
semiconductor technology.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the agreement, he said, NTC began paying some
US$60,000 every month to KSTC for several engineers the South Korean
firm sent to Taiwan, and that the amount was recently raised to
US$100,000 because more KSTC engineers have joined the team to
explore new technology.</P>
      <P>"The allegation that NTC has paid US$100,000 to buy the
technology is absolutely groundless," Chuang said.</P>
      <P>NTC is a subsidiary of the Formosa Group, one of the largest
conglomerates in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>To show its respect for intellectual property rights, NTC
specifically asked KSTC to give its assurances in the agreement that
it would not supply unauthorized information or secrets belonging to
others while developing the new technology, Chuang said.</P>
      <P>"So far, we have found no evidence KSTC violated the agreement,
but we would certainly terminate the contract if any such evidence is
found," he said.</P>
      <P>NTC is confident of its ability to develop new technology on its
own, Chuang said, adding, "Even if our cooperation with KSTC is
terminated, our development program will not be affected."</P>
      <P>He said that NTC's 64 megabit DRAM chip plant will become
operational next week and is scheduled to begin mass production in
June.</P>
      <P>NTC will, if necessary, take legal action to protect itself,
Chuang said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, officials with the ROC Ministry of Economic Affairs
refused to comment on the reports, but said that Taiwan is capable of
developing the technology for making 64 megabit DRAM chips without
outside help.</P>
      <P>Industrial sources said that aside from NTC, at least five other
Taiwan firms will begin mass production of 64 megabit DRAM chips this
year.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan lags behind South Korea and Japan in 64 megabit
DRAM chip technology, it's very likely that the island will catch up
by the end of this year, the sources said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>M'LAND CHINA COULD FACE LARGER TRANSSHIPMENT PENALTIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Geneva, Feb. 4 (CNA)
(By Maurus Young)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>US importers could see this year's quotas on
mainland Chinese textiles and apparel filled more quickly if
Washington moves ahead with transshipment charges against Beijing,
according to a report in the Journal of Commerce Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The two trading partners met in Beijing recently to discuss US
allegations that mainland China transshipped about US$1.7 million
worth of mainland Chinese-made goods through Hong Kong in 1995 and
1996.</P>
      <P>Last autumn, Washington initially accused Beijing of
transshipping about US$800,000 worth of textile items, but the amount
has veered upward with additional information.</P>
      <P>In November, the transshipment allegations involved US$800,000
worth of textile and apparel products, mostly gloves and underwear.
The talks in Beijing were the second round after the initial
consultations held in Washington in November. The US government is
waiting for the mainland Chinese authorities to respond with
additional information.</P>
      <P>According to the terms of the bilateral textile agreement, if the
United States goes ahead and slaps mainland China with single charges
of US$1.7 million, then the volume of transshipped goods will be
deducted from the current quota year. But if Washington decides to
slap on triple charges -- in which the penalty would equal three
times the volume of transshipped goods -- then the penalties would be
spread out over the three remaining years of the textile pact.</P>
      <P>The four-year pact expires at the end of 2000.</P>
      <P>According to the Journal of Commerce report, US importers aren't
overly concerned about the impact of possible transshipment charges.
"It is not a lot," Laura Jones, head of the US Association of
Importers of Textiles and Apparel in New York, was quoted as saying.</P>
      <P>She was referring to the US$1.7 million in imports now under US
scrutiny, a tiny portion of the nearly US$5 billion of textile and
apparel that mainland China shipped to the United States last year.
Jones said she did not know what type of apparel was part of the
disputed shipments, the journal said.</P>
      <P>But the possible combination of transshipment penalties, along
with the Asian financial crisis, might mean some categories of goods
from mainland China will be filled earlier than usual, she was quoted
as saying.</P>
      <P>Jones did not expect Asian apparel makers to flood the US market
because existing quotas will keep a cap on the products, no matter
how inexpensive they may be because of the devalued Asian currencies.
"Maybe some products will embargo a bit earlier," she added.</P>
      <P>The vast majority of products don't embargo until November and
December.</P>
      <P>If the United States moves to lodge transshipment charges against
the Asian economic giant, it would be the fourth consecutive year
that the US Customs Service has determined that mainland China evaded
US quotas, the Journal of Commerce added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER DEFENDS CABINET RESHUFFLE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 4 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>In his first press conference since Chinese
New Year, Premier Vincent Siew said that his recent reshuffling of
the Cabinet was mainly aimed at filling Cabinet positions with the
most suitable people and bringing new blood into the administration.</P>
      <P>Job performance was not a major consideration behind the
reorganization of his working team, Siew said. Wu Jin, who has just
been replaced as minister of education, enjoyed a higher approval
rating in several opinion polls than any other Cabinet member. His
dismissal has caused public uproar.</P>
      <P>Siew expressed his appreciation for the contributions and
achievements of the outgoing ministers, who also include Interior
Minister Yeh Chin-feng, Chairman of the Council of Labor Affairs Hsu
Chieh-kwei, Minister of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission James
Chu, National Youth Commission Chairman Huang Teh-fu,
Director-General of the Government Information Office David Lee.</P>
      <P>Citing his decision to tap Legislator Huang Chu-wen to be
minister of the interior as an example of his reasoning, Siew said
the interior minister -- as the man in charge of the body responsible
for local autonomy, social security and other concerns -- needs the
Legislature's support to accomplish the revision of related laws and
regulations.</P>
      <P>The premier said the need to reinvigorate the administration by
bringing in new blood was another reason behind the shakeup.</P>
      <P>He vowed to improve the administration's performance and called
on members of his new Cabinet to work aggressively and in solidarity
for a stable economy, the reorganization of the government, better
laws, improved social order, higher living standards and warmer
relations with Beijing.</P>
      <P>Boasting his administration is action-oriented, Siew said
maintaining economic stability will be a stern challenge for the
government amid the financial crisis that swept through the region.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan was not immune to the turmoil, he said that
his administration has taken steps to carefully monitor the unfolding
crisis and minimize its impact.</P>
      <P>Upgrading the quality of people's lives by wiping out industrial
accidents and social disturbance is another goal high on the
Cabinet's agenda, he said.</P>
      <P>Siew vowed to improve relations with Beijing, but insisted that
the dialogue across the Taiwan Strait should resume initially with
working-level negotiations rather than political talks as Beijing has
demanded.</P>
      <P>He said that given the wide gap between the political stances of
Taipei and Beijing, "political talks would only lead to confrontation
-- and therefore a stifling of further contacts -- rather than to the
improvement of bilateral ties."</P>
      <P>Noting that the international community, and Washington
especially, is urging the renewal of cross-strait contacts, Siew
called on Beijing to live up to the world's expectations by reopening
dialogue with Taipei in a pragmatic manner.</P>

(By Lin Wen-fen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Chen Chau-chien, the wife of 1996
independent presidential candidate Chen Lu-an, on Wednesday denied a
local news report that she and her husband will emigrate to Macau.</P>
      <P>Ms. Chen said that they love Taiwan and will not leave it, adding
that although her husband has spent most of his time since the March
1996 presidential election abroad, his heart remains in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>A mass-circulation local daily reported that the Chens, tired of
being kept under surveillance by secret agents when in Taiwan, have
decided to emigrate to Macau, where the cost of living is lower and
housing more affordable.</P>
      <P>According to the report, the former candidate has visited many
places since the election, including Southeast Asia, Australia, the
United States and Europe, and has made three trips to mainland China.
Chen, a devout Buddhist, also went to Nepal and Tibet along with his
master Sun Chun-hwa and his second son Chen Yu-ming to help the poor
and contribute to the repair of temples there.</P>
      <P>Ms. Chen said that her husband has gradually withdrawn from the
political arena since the race some two years ago and is focusing his
attention on charity work.</P>
      <P>Not long after the 1996 vote, which marked the first time in the
Chinese world that a president has been popularly elected, Chen Lu-an
went to Nepal for three months to help establish a Chinese language
school there and to assist in the repair of temples, she said.</P>
      <P>She said her husband has always said that he likes to go abroad
to enrich his horizons.</P>
      <P>Ms. Chen said that last September the two of them went to the
southern part of the Chinese mainland to collect local embroidery and
woodblock prints. The visit, she added, was very fruitful despite its
difficulties.</P>
      <P>When in Taiwan, Chen Lu-an prefers either to go to his office to

    <DATELINE>San  Francisco,  Feb.  3  (CNA)
(By Neil Lu &amp; Lin Wen-fen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan Governor James Soong on
Tuesday commented for the first time on the sensational allegations
of a scandal involving one of his top aides, saying that he was "very
shocked."</P>
      <P>Soong, who flew to Hawaii last week for his son's wedding before
going on to San Francisco for a vacation, took a midnight flight back
to Taiwan on Tuesday, earlier than scheduled.</P>
      <P>Asked how he would deal with the accusations against his chief
spokesman, Taiwan Provincial Government Department of Information
Director Huang Yi-chiao, Soong said that he has to understand the
whole situation before he can decide.</P>
      <P>On Monday, Clara Chou Yu-kou, a well-known journalist, author and
broadcaster, publicly accused Huang of having a two-year affair with
her that ended soon after he allegedly forced her to have an abortion
in October.</P>
      <P>Chou also accused Huang of simultaneously carrying on an affair
with a rich and pretty woman named Emmy Ho, who is very active in the
island's business and political circles. Chou said that Ho and Huang
have had intimate relations since last August and that Ho also had an
abortion only one week after her own identical operation.</P>
      <P>According to Chou, when Ho heard rumors of her affair with Huang,
the woman asked him if they were true and Huang said no.</P>
      <P>Chou said that Ho, at the prompting of her friend, well-known TV
entertainer Pai Ping-ping, telephoned her in January to try to learn
the facts.</P>
      <P>After several conversations over the telephone and a meeting, the
journalist said, she and Ho decided that Huang is a dishonest man who
had been shuttling between two lovers and resolved to make public the
whole incident to "teach Huang a lesson."</P>
      <P>Accusing Huang of being a liar, Chou said that a man inconsistent
in his words and deeds is not qualified to be a government spokesman.
Chou also wrote a letter to Soong, asking the provincial governor to
investigate the matter and to replace Huang.</P>
      <P>Ho, however, declined to comment on all of the allegations,
saying she didn't know Chou would make public the affair. While
acknowledging that she has been seeing Huang for more than half a
year and disclosing that he proposed to her, she stressed that she
did not have an abortion as Chou claimed.</P>
      <P>Huang, who divorced his wife one-and-a-half years ago, on Tuesday
denied the allegations against him, saying that although he and Chou
had spent some time together in the past, their relationship was
never sexual.</P>
      <P>He declined to characterize his relationship with Ho.</P>
      <P>Facing the toughest challenge of his political career, Huang took
a three-day leave on Tuesday.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN SHUT OUT OF US-SPONSORED FINANCIAL MEETING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Feb. 4 (CNA)
(By Herman Pan and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan will be shut out of a high-level
international financial meeting to be sponsored by the United States
later this year to discuss effective measures to fight regional
financial crises similar to the one that has hit Asia since last
summer.</P>
      <P>The Clinton Administration announced on Wednesday that it has
invited the finance ministers and central banks governors of 21
economies around the world to attend the meeting "scheduled to be
held in the next few months."</P>
      <P>The economies invited to the planned conference included
mainland China, Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea, Indonesia, Malaysia,
Singapore, Thailand, India, Australia, Britain, France, Germany,
Canada, South Africa, Russia, Mexico, Poland, Argentina and Brazil.</P>
      <P>Asked why the US has not extended an invitation to Taiwan, an
economic powerhouse in Asia, Treasury Department spokesman Kelly
Crawford said the US has only invited some representative economies.
"Another Asian economy, the Philippines, has also not been invited
to the meeting," he added.</P>
      <P>The Republic of China's representative office in Washington, D.C.
said American authorities have not made any contacts with it for the
planned financial meeting.</P>
      <P>The meeting will be chaired by US Treasury Secretary Robert E.
Rubin and Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan. The exact
conference date has yet to be decided. Treasury Department sources
said the meeting is likely to take place immediately after a joint
board meeting of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World
Bank to be held in Washington, D.C. in mid-April.</P>
      <P>The sources said the planned meeting will discuss financial
challenges faced by developing countries, particularly the
recent Asian financial turmoil, as well as concrete measures to cope
with such a regional financial crisis and to prevent recurrence of
similar financial fiasco.</P>
      <P>Testifying at a congressional hearing on Wednesday, Deputy
Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers said the US should not
adopt a hands-off policy in face of the current Asian
financial meltdown. "We should financially support the IMF to
offer aid to Asian countries in trouble and demand them to undertake
fundamental financial reforms in order to prevent the regional
crisis from triggering a worldwide financial storm," he stressed.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TSINGHUA U. PROFESSOR MAKES BREAKTHROUGH FIND IN FOSSIL RECORD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  5 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The recent discovery of fossilized sponges
and animal embryos dating back 580 million years ago in Guizhou,
southwestern mainland China, has moved back the date of the earliest
appearance of complex and varied forms of life on earth by 40 million
to 50 million years, Professor Li Chia-wei of National Tsinghua
University said on Thursday.</P>
      <P>The discovery, which Li made with Professor Chen Junyuan of the
Nanjing Institute of Geology and Paleontology, could lead to the
overthrow of the current scientific view of the origin of most of the
world's animals.</P>
      <P>Li and Chen's findings were published simultaneously in separate
reports in the most recent editions of Nature, a British journal, and
Science, a US periodical.</P>
      <P>Before their discovery, the existing fossil record showed that
almost all animal phyta appeared within five million years in the
early Cambrian period, about 530 million years ago. This apparent
sudden evolutionary growth spurt is known as the "Cambrian
explosion."</P>
      <P>Such dramatic diversification in such a relatively short time
puzzled scientists.</P>
      <P>Molecular biologists advanced the idea the process actually began
a billion years ago and proceeded gradually. Proponents of this
theory, however, lacked solid evidence.</P>
      <P>Li and Chen's discovery of plant tissues and animal embryos in
rocks 580 million years, however, will supply important data toward
understanding the mystery of evolution's "big bang."</P>
      <P>"Our discovery of the oldest animal fossils, including sponges
and various kinds of animal embryos, indicates there were probably
varieties of animals belonging to several known phyta that lived 40
million to 50 million years before the Cambrian explosion," Li said
in the Science report, which he co-authored.</P>
      <P>"The results suggest the evolution of animals is a continuation
of a process that began long before. Furthermore, the preservation is
so superb, details of some cellular structures can still be observed.
It may open a new window of exploring ancient biomolecules," he said.</P>
      <P>Li told a CNA reporter that his and Chen's findings "may lead to
the smashing of the myth of the Cambrian explosion."</P>
      <P>The two scientists first became acquainted in July 1996, when
Taiwan's Museum of Natural Sciences, which Li then headed, hosted the
world's first international exhibition focusing on the Cambrian
explosion. Chen was one of those invited to Taiwan to bless the
exhibition.</P>
      <P>The exhibition sparked Li's curiosity enough for him to quit his
job as the museum's curator and return to teaching.</P>
      <P>Since resigning his museum post one-and-a-half years ago, Li, a
veteran molecular biologist, has frequently gone with Chen to
Guizhou's Wengan County, where they finally made the landmark
discovery.</P>

    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Feb.  5  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia is an unimportant player
standing on the sidelines of the Asian economic turmoil, according to
Singapore's Information Minister George Yeo.</P>
      <P>In an exclusive interview with foreign editor Greg Sheridan of
the mass circulation newspaper The Australian, Yeo, who also serves
in Singapore's Ministry of Trade and Industry, said Australia was
seen as a friend who expresses concern but does not want to get
involved.</P>
      <P>"It is the reaction of someone on the margin, not an important
player, not a crucial partner," Yeo said.</P>
      <P>"If there's a melee and you get fully involved, then you bond
with the people whose side you take and you bond permanently. But if
you stay on the sidelines, then there is no bonding and you stay out
permanently," he continued.</P>
      <P>Yeo said Australians were possibly feeling some relief that they
were "not more a part of the region and therefore not more affected."</P>
      <P>But he said the regional economic crisis would be a defining
moment in the lives of a whole generation of young Asian leaders. And
the way powers such as the United States, mainland China, Japan and
Australia responded to the crisis would define the way young Asian
leaders think of them for the rest of their lives.</P>
      <P>"How Australia presents itself and defines itself during this
crisis is of infinitely more importance than Pauline Hanson and the
speeches of leaders," Yeo said.</P>
      <P>Hanson is an Independent Member of Parliament from Brisbane who
triggered racial debate in Australia because of her remarks against
Asian immigration.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US ACCUSED OF GRABBING AUSTRALIAN COMMODITY MARKETS IN ASIA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra, Feb. 5 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia's Prime Minister John Howard has
accused the United States of using the Asian currency crisis to grab
Australia's agricultural export markets in the region.</P>
      <P>On Wednesday, Howard announced that the government would give
emergency credit insurance to Australian exporters to Indonesia and
other Asian countries on a case-by-case basis so that they would not
be threatened by their American counterparts, who receive export
guarantee funding from the US government to sell their farm produce
in the region.</P>
      <P>Howard said the move is needed because Australia's Asian markets
could be threatened by "actively avaricious" US export insurance
schemes in Asia.</P>
      <P>He said Canberra is "gathering material" on the American
activities and is considering diplomatic and trade retaliation
against Washington.</P>
      <P>"At a time like this, when our exporters are facing fierce, even
on occasions actively avaricious, competition from United States
exporters into Indonesia who are not being shy in the export methods
being employed in order to gain access to the Indonesian market, it
is very important my government ... stands up for the interest of
Australian exporters," he said.</P>
      <P>"There is evidence that some US activity is designed to take
advantage of the situation, and I certainly won't be silent ... in
saying what needs to be said to counteract that," he continued.</P>
      <P>The Howard government will give the credit insurance to
Australian exporters through its Export Finance Insurance Corporation
(EFIC) when they sell commodities in Indonesia and elsewhere.</P>
      <P>Last month, the EFIC provided about A$300 million (US$205
million) to Australian exporters when they sold agricultural produce
to South Korea.</P>
      <P>Australian trade officials have warned that the US push to grab
the Asian markets might trigger a trade war between the two
countries.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  5 (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The resumption of talks between Taipei and
Beijing depends on whether the Singapore Agreement the two sides
reached in 1993 is adhered to or not, and Taiwan and mainland China
can simultaneously discuss both political and technical matters in
the future, remarked Koo Chen-fu, chairman of the Taipei-based
Straits Exchange Foundation, on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Once talks between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait resume,
they can be conducted "without division between phases," Koo said,
indicating that political discussions could take place at the same
time as talks on matters of technical issues.</P>
      <P>Cross-strait discussions should proceed gradually, he stressed,
adding that the two sides "should never let their hands become tied."</P>
      <P>Noting that political issues tend to restrict the options of both
sides, Koo said that it would be better to settle technical matters
before proceeding to a political dialogue and finally to political
negotiations.</P>
      <P>Koo's remarks echo those of Premier Vincent Siew, who, in his
first press conference since the Chinese Lunar New Year, stressed
more than once on Wednesday that while Taipei does not rule out
cross-strait political dialogue, the government believes it would be
better to resume talks initially with working-level negotiations
rather than with political talks. This arrangement, Siew said, would
better serve the interests of both sides.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FEMALE NAVAL OFFICERS TO SERVE ON KNOX-CLASS FRIGATES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 5 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Nineteen senior female Chinese Naval Academy
cadets will be assigned to serve on the Republic of China
Navy's Knox-class missile frigates after they graduate from the
academy in November, a high-ranking naval officer announced on
Thursday.</P>
      <P>It will be the first time that the ROC Navy has dispatched female
career officers to serve on missile frigates. Until now, female naval
officers only serve on Ta Kuan (wide vision) observation vessels or
on troop transport ships.</P>
      <P>Hu Tsai-kuei, chief of staff at Navy General Headquarters, said
female career officers have performed consistently well in the navy.
Over the past few years, Hu said, the naval academy has assigned
female sophomore and junior cadets to receive one-month training
courses on tank landing-supply ships, pointing out: "The programs
show that female officers are as competent as their male counterparts
in terms of both physical strength and capabilities."</P>
      <P>Against this background, Hu said, the navy has decided to assign
the 19 naval academy graduates to serve on the six Knox-class missile
frigates leased from the United States. Hu said all six frigates are
equipped with living facilities especially designed for female
officers.</P>
      <P>Responding to reports that the US has agreed to sell three
Knox-class frigates to Taiwan, a naval officer said the navy would
only purchase two of the vessels, because the third is not in good
condition. "We'll discuss the issue further with the US authorities,"
said the official, who preferred anonymity.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the navy can detect activity by Russian-built
Kilo-class submarines purchased by mainland China, the official said
it's not easy to monitor the submarines because their hulls are made
of special materials to reduce noise. The navy's S-70C anti-submarine
helicopters are equipped with low frequency sonar to detect submarine
activity in the waters around Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"We hope the US will sell us ultra-low frequency sonar to beef up
our anti-submarine capabilities," he said, adding that as mainland
China has acquired several of the Kilo-class submarines, the ROC Navy
has intensified patrols in waters surrounding Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>WINBOND TO NEGOTIATE IPR INFRINGEMENT CHARGE WITH EMI</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Feb.  4  (CNA)
(By Herman Pan and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Winbond Electronics Corp., one of
Taiwan's largest semiconductor manufacturers, said on Wednesday that
it will begin negotiations on Thursday with the EMI Group over a
patent infringement dispute.</P>
      <P>The Delaware-based American affiliate of the London-based EMI
Group neither denied nor confirmed Winbond's statement, but an EMI
spokesman pointed out that it's not uncommon among high-technology
companies to settle patent right infringement disputes out of court,
as it usually takes many years to resolve such cases through the
court system.</P>
      <P>The spokesman said EMI has asked the Delaware court to ban
circulation of products made by Winbond and its two US affiliates
that have allegedly infringed upon EMI's patent rights. The company
has also demanded that Winbond pay EMI damages of three times the
value of its counterfeited products, he added.</P>
      <P>Responding to EMI's move, Chang Shou-tung, a senior Winbond
executive stationed in the US, said that although EMI has filed a
lawsuit, Winbond has not received any court order. According to US
law, EMI's charge against Winbond won't take effect until 120 days
following receipt of the court order.</P>
      <P>The EMI Group's American affiliate on Monday sued Winbond and its
two US branches on charges of infringing upon two of its patent
rights related to the production of integrated circuits (ICs).</P>
      <P>The EMI Group, which utilizes multiple technologies to support a
wide range of products, including video, voice and data recording
services, is the largest musical publisher in Britain. EMI's American
affiliate recently acquired Colorado-based Inmos Co., thus obtaining
patent rights on a number of semiconductor and other related high
technologies.</P>
      <P>This is the second patent infringement lawsuit against Winbond
since last July, when another American firm sued the Taiwan
semiconductor giant for infringing upon its patent right relating to
the production of CD-ROM drives.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Chang King-yuh, chairman of the Mainland
Affairs Council (MAC), stressed on Thursday that Taiwan's policies
toward mainland China won't be affected by the change at the top of
one of the island's agencies related to cross-strait affairs.</P>
      <P>Chang made the remarks during the inauguration of Shi Hwei-you,
director-general of the ruling Kuomintang's Department of
Secretariat, as vice chairman and secretary-general of the Straits
Exchange Foundation (SEF), a quasi-official intermediary body
established to handle private exchanges across the Taiwan Strait in
the absence of formal contacts between the two sides.</P>
      <P>Shi is replacing Chiao Jen-ho, who was named head of the Overseas
Chinese Affairs Commission in the latest Cabinet reshuffle.</P>
      <P>Shi, trained as a lawyer, earned a reputation as a tough
negotiator by refusing to budge during several rounds of talks with
his mainland Chinese counterparts.</P>
      <P>Chang reiterated that the Republic of China has but one mainland
policy, calling the MAC -- the highest government agency in charge of
charting this policy -- and the SEF "virtually two sides of one
mechanism."</P>
      <P>Even though Beijing unilaterally suspended the cross-strait
dialogue more than two years ago, the SEF has continued to work for
communication and to push for exchanges with mainland China, Chang
noted.</P>
      <P>Chang renewed Taipei's calls for the resumption of the
cross-strait dialogue, denying Beijing's accusations that Taiwan's
policy makers have been lukewarm or even intentionally reluctant to
return to the negotiating table.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC DENIES CONCESSIONS IN WTO TALKS WITH US</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  5  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Senior government officials on Thursday
unanimously denied press reports that the Republic of China would
make concessions to the United States in agricultural trade talks
next week in exchange for Washington's support for its bid to join
the World Trade Organization (WTO).</P>
      <P>Chen Ruey-long, director-general of the Board of Foreign Trade
(BOFT), said it's unthinkable that the government would agree to
compromise on the thorny farm trade issues before a new round of
Taipei-Washington WTO talks starts.</P>
      <P>"We would firmly uphold our basic stance in negotiating with the
US for joining the Geneva-based world trade regulatory body on the
best possible terms for us," Chen stressed.</P>
      <P>Chen Pao-chi, director of the Council of Agriculture's Animal
Industry Department, also said the council would not sacrifice any
agricultural sector in negotiating with the US for Taiwan's WTO bid.</P>
      <P>The mass-circulation China Times reported on Thursday that
Taiwan would offer to cut tariffs on pork and chicken, among the few
items over which Taiwan and the US have yet to reach agreement, but
would stand firm on imports of rice, the island's staple food.</P>
      <P>The US reportedly has demanded that Taipei cut import duty on
pork by 15 percent in the first year of its WTO entry, and that the
tariff be slashed by a total of 50 percent to 7.5 percent over a
six-year period.</P>
      <P>On rice imports, the US has proposed that Taiwan follow the
formula Japan used in opening its rice market, but Taiwan has
rejected the proposal. Under the Japanese model, Taipeil would have
to allow rice imports equalling 4 percent of overall domestic rice
consumption in the first year of accession to the WTO. Imports
would be increased by 0.8 percent annually over a six-year
period.</P>
      <P>Chen said the report is erraneous, stressing that the
government would not compromise on pork issues because the pig
industry has played an important role in Taiwan's agricultural
sector.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, chicken and pig farmers as well as animal feed
producers have threatened to boycott American agricultural products
in protest of its pressure on Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Taipei and Washington had held 16 rounds of WTO talks.
Differences over agricultural trade, particularly terms related to
rice, pork and chicken imports, have hindered the two sides from
reaching a final agreement.</P>
      <P>The two countries are scheduled to meet again on the issue
starting on Feb. 9. Vice Economic Affairs Minister Lin Yi-fu will
head a delegation of senior trade and agricurltural officials to
Washington, D. C. this weekend for working-level consultations with
American officials on Feb. 9-14.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Economics Minister Wang Chih-kang will leave for the
US on Feb. 14 to chair policy negotiations, scheduled for Feb.
17-18, with relevant American officials over terms for Taiwan's WTO
entry.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has completed WTO talks with 23 of the 26 major trade
partners that have expressed intention to hold bilateral talks
with it concerning its WTO bid. The three WTO contracting
parties that have yet to finalize such talks are the US, the
15-member European Union and Switzerland.</P>

    <DATELINE>Singapore,   Feb.  5  (CNA)
(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Singapore's first foray into the
development of new commercial aircraft could end before the project
gets off the ground.</P>
      <P>The fate of Singapore's participation in the Asia-Europe AE31X
program is likely to be decided at talks expected to take place
during the Asian Aerospace '98 Show to be held in Singapore later
this month, The Straits Times reported Thursday in a dispatch from
Toulouse, France.</P>
      <P>"At the air show, we will have a meeting with the Singaporeans to
come to a definitive conclusion on their participation," Jean-Paul
Perrais, Aerospatiale's senior vice president and adviser to the
president, told Singapore reporters.</P>
      <P>Aerospatiale's Airbus Industrie and Alenia of Italy have
established a special subsidiary company, AIA, as the European
partner in the joint venture with Aviation Industries of China (AVIC)
and Singapore Technologies (ST) to build a new family of 100-seater
aircraft, the report said.</P>
      <P>AIA will own 39 percent of the venture program, AVIC 46 percent
and ST, the remaining 15 percent. The work will be shared according
to this participation rate.</P>
      <P>Perrais estimated that the development cost would come to US$2.2
billion, the report said. Two versions of the single-aisle aircraft
are planned: The AE316 will be a 95-to-105-seater and the AE317, a
115-to-125-seater.</P>
      <P>Both aircraft -- which will have a flight deck similar to the
A320 -- will have a range of up to 2,760 nautical miles (5,112 kms).</P>
      <P>Airbus forecasts some 5,400 deliveries in the 70-to-150-seater
category. Over the next 20 years, the joint venture aims to win at
least 30 percent of this market.</P>
      <P>First deliveries are planned for 2003.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, talks on Singapore's participation have hit a snag,
the report said.</P>
      <P>According to Perrais, this was because of ST's insistence on a
comprehensive business plan and an assessment of the rate of return
before the program can begin.</P>
      <P>"We cannot make an assessment of viability immediately. What we
need first is a clear definition of the aircraft we're producing," he
was quoted as saying.</P>
      <P>"We cannot have a theoretical definition. We have to see if
China, where the final assembly of the aircraft will take place, can
produce them at low cost.</P>
      <P>"This takes time. Only after defining the specifications of the
aircraft can the partners decide on pricing and operating cost," he
noted.</P>
      <P>He commented: "ST does not have the experience in aircraft
programs, which are not the same as those of, say, producing cars.
There are quite different factors at play."</P>
      <P>Asked what would happen if Singapore withdrew from the program,
Perrais replied: "Well, we will have to find another partner. Or
possibly, there can be only the two remaining partners. However, we
hope Singapore will keep an interest in the program.</P>
      <P>"The technical leadership for the program will be given to the
Europeans, but personnel from China and Singapore will be integrated
into it," he said.</P>
      <P>The United States has been identified as the main market for the
planes, where they would replace aging aircraft such as the Boeing
737.</P>
      <P>"For this reason, the aircraft will have to meet the requirements
of the United States if we want to compete with Boeing's 717, which
will go into service in 1999, three years before our own 100-seater,"
said Perrais.</P>
      <P>He calculated that 40 percent of the market will be in the United
States, 20 to 25 percent in Europe, 12 percent in mainland China and
the rest in Asia and Africa.</P>
      <P>"The 100-seater would be operated by the largest of the regional
airlines and the smallest of the big airlines," he said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>After successfully avoiding damage from the
regional financial storm, Taiwan, widely seen as a haven for funds,
has been recently given a high grade in financial performance.</P>
      <P>According to a ratings report by Standard and Poor on the
long-term credit performance of foreign currency issuers, Taiwan
scored an "AA+" because of the low percentage of debt burdens enjoyed
by all financial institutions on the island.</P>
      <P>This performance has contributed to the island's escaping any big
impact from the financial crises which have resulted in heavy
economic recessions in most Asian countries.</P>
      <P>The S&amp;P assessment marked Taiwan as a country enjoying "stable"
financial prospects, while the rating placed the island in third
position among the Asian economies behind Japan and Singapore, both
of which scored "AAA," representing remarkable capacity for managing
currency circulation and monitoring financial operation, the report
showed.</P>
      <P>The S&amp;P report, released last December, contains the US-based
consulting and rating company's risk assessment of over 70 developed

Thursday told a visiting Taiwan delegation that it hopes its
investment plan for central Taiwan's Taichung Harbor will receive a
construction license from the relevant authorities in March so that
construction can begin in September.</P>
      <P>Although some difficulties remain to be overcome, a Bayer
spokesman said the company still hopes that the investment plan,
which has been temporarily shelved as a result of fierce opposition
from Taichung County residents, will proceed smoothly.</P>
      <P>Residents in the area fear Bayer's construction of a planned
chemical plant will cause pollution, but the spokesman urged the
people of Taiwan to have confidence in Bayer's technology and
sincerity.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks while making a presentation on Bayer's safety
measures and management to the delegation composed of more than 30
academics, opinion leaders and government officials of the Republic
of China.</P>
      <P>The government-led delegation, which departed Taipei for Germany
on Wednesday, was visiting Bayer headquarters in a last-ditch effort
to woo the pharmaceutical giant back to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Y.S. Liu, one of the delegates and vice chairman of the
Cabinet-level Council for Economic Planning and Development, said ROC
Premier Vincent Siew is very concerned about subsequent developments
in the matter and has asked the delegation to bring back first-hand
and detailed information to serve as a reference for policy decisions
by the relevant government agencies.</P>
      <P>Liu said the central government has been actively coordinating
with the country's provincial council, in the hope that it will call
a session in mid-February to review the Bayer case.</P>
      <P>Bayer announced in December that it was withdrawing a NT$50
billion plan to build a production plant for toluene di-isocyanate
near central Taichung Harbor after Liao Yung-Lai, the then newly
elected Taichung County Magistrate of the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party, vowed to hold a public referendum to decide the
fate of the controversial plan.</P>
      <P>Siew and Taiwan Provincial Governor James Soong both wrote to
Bayer, in late December and early this year respectively, suggesting
the group reconsider its withdrawal, but the company claimed to have
already found an alternative site in the United States.</P>

    <HEADLINE>JAPAN  MUST PLAY ACTIVE ROLE IN HELPING OTHER ASIAN NATIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Geneva,  Feb. 5 (CNA)
(By Maurus Young)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>US Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky
has blasted Japan for what she called "woefully inadequate" efforts
to help other Asian nations emerge from the ongoing financial crisis,
according to reports from the Geneva-based World Trade Organization
(WTO) on Thursday.</P>
      <P>"Japan, as the world's second-largest economy, must play a more
active role in helping to bring Asia out of its current economic
crisis," the WTO report quoted Barshefsky as saying. "Its efforts to
date have been woefully inadequate."</P>
      <P>"Japan must stimulate domestic demand. It must deregulate its
economy. It must open up to provide a market of first resort for the
tremendous productive capacity of the region," the US trade
representative was quoted as saying.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, Barshefsky praised communist China for playing
the "most constructive" role in the crisis, citing Beijing's recent
commitments to economic reforms and exchange rate stability without
devaluating its currency.</P>
      <P>Her remarks echoed recent comments by other top US officials who
have urged Tokyo to take further economic action, including fiscal
and banking measures, to ensure a solid recovery.</P>
      <P>In Washington, concerns are spreading that the US may become the
only and last resort, with its strong economy to absorb more imports
from Asia, to help the affected nations.</P>
      <P>But Barshefsky reiterated the US commitments to restoring
stability in Asia as long as crisis-hit nations continue to proceed
with economic reforms imposed by the International Monetary Fund
(IMF).</P>
      <P>"We cannot expect that Asia will sort out its problems without
us, and we cannot afford the consequences if does not," the WTO
report quoted Barshefsky as saying, noting that affected Asian
economies "must reform or recovery is impossible.</P>
      <P>"We must be in a position to help them do it," Barshefsky said in
urging the US Congress to authorize US$18 billion in funds planned to
be extended to the IMF to beef up its functions, the WTO report
added.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  5  (CNA)
(By Lin Wen-fen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan Governor James Soong on Thursday
assigned new posts to his chief spokesman in a quick response to
sensational allegations that have for days captured Taiwan's media
spotlight.</P>
      <P>Soong made his decision several hours after he returned from a US
trip, opting to remove Huang Yi-Chiao from his post as Taiwan
provincial government information chief and demoting him by one rank
to the post of "acting deputy secretary-general," as well as
"consultant" in Soong's administration.</P>
      <P>In a statement issued at noon, Soong reaffirmed Huang's ability,
professional performance and dedication to the job of provincial
government spokesman, but stressed the importance he attaches to a
civil servant's moral character.</P>
      <P>Considering the fact that the allegations against Huang might
have a negative impact on society and harm the image of the
provincial government as a close-knit team, Soong decided to relieve
Huang from his post immediately, the statement said, adding that if
Huang were to remain in the position, he might encounter difficulties
in carrying out his duties in the wake of the scandal.</P>
      <P>"Public figures and civil servants should impose strict moral
standards on themselves to meet public expectations, as what they say
and how they act will in some way serve as a model to the public,"
said Chin Ching-sheng, Huang's successor and former deputy
secretary-general in the provincial administration, reading from
Soong's statement.</P>
      <P>"The governor has set high moral standards for himself and always
demands the same self discipline from his staff. In addition to
ability and performance, the governor attaches much importance to the
moral character of his staff members.</P>
      <P>"The governor believes that decency and honesty among civil
servants is essential to win the trust of the people. Being honest
and upright is not only the basic requirements for civil servants, it
is also their responsibility to society" the statement said.</P>
      <P>Huang, who has not been seen in public since taking a three-day
leave on Tuesday, entered Soong's official residence at around 8:35
a.m., where he reportedly apologized for the adverse attention he has
brought on the provincial government and asked Soong to forgive him.</P>
      <P>Local reports said that Soong didn't scold him.</P>
      <P>Clara Chou Yu-kuo, a popular journalist, author and broadcaster
who accused Huang of carrying on simultaneous affairs with her and
noted socialite Emmy Ho, declined to comment on Huang's demotion.</P>
      <P>Emmy Ho, who appeared for the first time in public in an evening
interview with local TV channel TVBS on Thursday, said that she felt
the provincial government has made the appropriate response to the
incident, adding that she hopes the incident will now come to an end.</P>
      <P>The sex scandal broke out on Monday when Chou publicly accused
Huang of having a two-year affair with her which ended soon after he
allegedly forced her to have an abortion in October.</P>
      <P>She said that while involved with her, Huang also carried on an
affair with the rich and pretty Emmy Ho, who is very active in
business and political circles. Chou said that Ho and Huang have had
intimate relations since last August and that Ho also had an abortion
only one week after her own.</P>
      <P>According to Chou, she and Ho, after several telephone
conversations, decided that Huang is a dishonest man who had been
shuttling between his two lovers, and resolved to make public the
whole incident to "teach Huang a lesson."</P>
      <P>Before Chou made the affair public, she wrote a letter to Soong
demanding that Huang be fired. Chou said that a man like Huang,
inconsistent in his words and deeds, is not qualified to be the
provincial government spokesman and should be replaced.</P>
      <P>But when reporters turned to Ho to try to learn her side of the
story, Ho declined to comment on all of the allegations, saying in
several newspaper interviews that she didn't know Chou would go
public with the affair. While acknowledging that she had been seeing
Huang for more than six months and disclosing that he had proposed to
her, she stressed that she didn't have an abortion as Chou claimed.</P>
      <P>One day after the outbreak of the scandal, Huang, who divorced
his wife one-and-a-half years ago, denied the allegations against
him, saying that although he and Chou had spent some time together in
the past, their relationship was never sexual.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CABINET RESHUFFLE APPROVED BY 40 PERCENT OF POPULATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 5 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Although Premier Vincent Siew has urged the
public to trust his new Cabinet lineup, only 40 percent of the people
are buying his claims that the shakeup is aimed at boosting the
effectiveness of his administration, according to the results of a
survey released on Thursday.</P>
      <P>The opinion poll conducted on Wednesday afternoon by the local
office of the consultancy firm Louis Harris International, showed
that 39.9 percent of those surveyed agreed that the shakeup is a step
towards improving the government's overall performance, compared to
25.9 percent who disagreed, 10.2 percent who said it's difficult to
say, and 24.1 percent who had no idea, or who refused to reply.</P>
      <P>The reshuffle, which has seen seven ministers replaced, has
caused an uproar among the local mass media, because some of the
outgoing ministers enjoyed high approval ratings in recent opinion
polls or had just been sworn in.</P>
      <P>Anticipating the criticism, Siew emphasized at a press conference
on Wednesday that the reshuffle was needed to enhance the
government's operation and was not just an exercise to bring in new
faces. He called on the public to trust him, just as baseball fans
trust the coaches of their favorite teams.</P>
      <P>The survey also found that 36.1 percent of the respondents
believed that Siew, rather than his political mentor President Lee
Teng-hui, was firmly in charge of the reshuffle, while 39.5 percent
described the scale of the reshuffle is "appropriate."</P>
      <P>Among the seven new Cabinet members, Chiao Jen-ho, designated as
the new head of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, was ranked
in the poll as the most appropriate choice, followed by the incoming
director-general of the Government Information Office Chen Chien-jen
and the new interior minister, Huang Chu-wen.</P>
      <P>When asked what field of government affairs most needs
improvement, an overwhelming majority -- 62.7 percent -- named
domestic policy, an answer reflecting the public's concerns about
affairs related directly to their own well-being.</P>
      <P>The telephone survey, carried out between 4:00 p.m. and 10:00
p.m. on Wednesday, interviewed 1,087 adults, with a margin of error
of plus or minus 3 percent, according to the consultancy firm.

      <P>The Slovak Republic will set up a
representative office in the Republic of China next year to promote
economic relations between Taiwan and the East European country, a
visiting Slovak business leader said on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Peter Mihok, Chairman of the Slovak Chamber of Commerce and
Industry, and Martin Hrivik, the chamber's secretary-general, arrived
in Taipei on Monday for a week-long visit to woo Taiwan investment,
at the invitation of the Central European Trade Promotion Council
(CETPC).</P>
      <P>Mihok said during an investment seminar that Slovakia will soon
be included in the European Union, and cited low labor costs and an
abundant supply of high-quality manpower as other advantages in
investing in the country.</P>
      <P>He told local businessmen at the seminar that labor costs in the
Slovak Republic are 18 percent lower than in the Czech Republic and
23 percent lower than in Hungary. The country produces some 12,000
highly educated personnel annually, 20 percent of whom enter
high-tech industries.</P>
      <P>To facilitate the exchange of visits between the two countries,
Mihok said that Slovakia has decided to set up a representative
office in Taiwan next year, which is likely to be given the authority
to issue visas. The CETPC for its part proposed that Slovakia grant
ROC passport holders the privilege of obtaining landing visas.</P>
      <P>However, some businessmen with experience of doing business with
the East European country mentioned the poor quality of customs
services there. Some of them also pointed out that the tax burden is
quite heavy in Slovakia, adding that income tax can be as high as 40
percent.</P>

    <HEADLINE>M'LAND SCIENTIST WILLING TO COME TO TAIWAN FOR JOINT RESEARCH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 6 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The mainland Chinese scientist who, working
together with a Taiwanese professor, recently discovered the
oldest-known fossils of complex animal life forms, said on Friday he
would like to be able to visit Taiwan to jointly conduct scientific
research with his counterparts on the island.</P>
      <P>Professor Chen Junyuan of the Nanjing Institute of Geology and
Paleontology and Professor Li Chia-wei of Taiwan's National Tsinghua
University together discovered fossils of embryos from the
Precambrian era, millions of years before the evolutionary growth
spurt known as the "Cambrian explosion."</P>
      <P>Their findings -- published simultaneously in separate reports in
the most recent editions of Nature, a British journal, and Science, a
US periodical -- look set to rewrite the history of life on the
planet.</P>
      <P>In a telephone interview with the Taipei-based United Daily News,
Chen said he was thrilled that a personal friendship across the
Taiwan Strait -- the two sides of which are political arch rivals --
has developed into such a rewarding scientific cooperation.</P>
      <P>He called his collaboration with Li "nearly perfect."</P>
      <P>Chen recalled that he first became acquainted with Li in July
1996, when he visited Taiwan to attend the world's first
international exhibition focusing on the Cambrian explosion hosted by
the Provincial Museum of Natural Sciences in Taichung, central
Taiwan. Li was then the curator of the museum.</P>
      <P>After a talk on the Cambrian explosion, the two scientists
developed a friendship that led to Li's frequent visits to mainland
China for relevant studies, Chen noted.</P>
      <P>Chen, who has just been elected a member of the ninth National
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference,
pledged to do his utmost to push for closer scientific and
technological cooperation between Taiwan and mainland China, saying
working together in this way would eventually benefit people on both
sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Li and Chen's discovery of fossilized sponges and animal embryos
dating back 580 million years ago in Guizhou, southwestern mainland
China, has moved back the date of the earliest appearance of complex
and varied forms of life on earth by 40 million to 50 million years.</P>
      <P>The discovery, according to Li, could lead to the overthrow of
the current scientific view of the origin of most of the world's
animals.</P>
      <P>Before their discovery, the existing fossil record showed that
almost all animal phyta appeared during the Cambrian explosion, a
five million year span in the early Cambrian period.</P>
      <P>But such dramatic diversification in such a relatively short time
puzzled scientists.</P>
      <P>Molecular biologists advanced the idea the process actually began
a billion years ago and proceeded gradually. Proponents of this
theory, however, lacked solid evidence.</P>
      <P>Li and Chen's discovery of plant tissues and animal embryos in
rocks 580 million years old, however, will supply important data
toward understanding the mystery of evolution's "big bang."</P>
      <P>"Our discovery of the oldest animal fossils, including sponges
and various kinds of animal embryos, indicates there were probably
varieties of animals belonging to several known phyta that lived 40
million to 50 million years before the Cambrian explosion," Li noted.</P>

      <P>Do you love rice but worry about eating
something that may still be coated with pesticides and other
chemicals? If so, a wedding of Austrian technology and Taiwanese
equipment may soon put your mind at ease.</P>
      <P>An Austrian firm recently agreed to transfer its patented
technology for removing chemical residues to a company in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Not a trace of pesticides remains on foods that have been
processed through this new technological method, which was originally
developed to rid coffee beans of harmful chemicals.</P>
      <P>With the expansion of the demand for "natural foods," scientists
with the Austrian firm turned to expanding the technique for use in
cleaning unpolished rice, said an executive from one of the companies
involved.</P>
      <P>Rice is a deeply-rooted part of the diet in much of Asia,
including Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Having successfully developed a method for cleaning unpolished
rice, the scientists began working on an application for polished
rice, the executive said. He asked that the firms not be identified,
citing commercial competitiveness concerns.</P>
      <P>So far only Germany and Austria have this technology, he claimed.</P>
      <P>If the cooperation goes well, he said, a "natural" polished rice,
which might have a different appearance from unprocessed rice, could
be on the market by next year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LABOR AFFAIRS CHIEF CALLS FOR IMPROVEMENT OF ABORIGINES' LIVES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  6  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's top labor affairs official on
Friday proposed that whenever the island's construction businesses
hire foreign laborers, they also take on a certain number of
aboriginal workers.</P>
      <P>Chan Huo-sheng, the newly-inaugurated chairman of the
Cabinet-level Council of Labor Affairs (CLA), instructed his council
to study the feasibility of a quota that would require companies in
the construction sector that hire foreign laborers to employ a
certain percentage of aborigines as part of the effort to improve the
livelihood of Taiwan's poorest ethnic group.</P>
      <P>Chan demanded that CLA officials put out an initiative within six
months aimed at quickly solving the unemployment problem that has
long plagued the island's aboriginal people.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, he also instructed the CLA to begin a survey next week
of aboriginal people's willingness to receive vocational training and
be employed. The government should work to raise the living standards
of Taiwan's native inhabitants by "giving them a fishing net rather
than fish," he said.</P>
      <P>Chan gave the instructions Friday after visiting an aboriginal
village in Hsichih, suburban Taipei, where some 500 native mountain
people originally from eastern Taiwan's Hualien and Taitung counties
reside in shacks without electricity or running water.</P>
      <P>Chan met with the village residents, many of whom lamented that
their already difficult lives will become even harder because their
shelters are soon to be torn down to make way for the new high-speed
rail line.</P>
      <P>The CLA chief promised them he would waste no time before looking
into their problems.</P>
      <P>The rim of greater Taipei is home to about 30,000 aborigines of
various tribes, most of whom are poor and have little hope of better
lives.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ASIAN CRISIS HITS AUSSIE TOURISM INDUSTRY HARD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Feb.  6  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Asian currency crisis is taking a
serious toll on the Australian tourism industry as tourist arrivals
from Taiwan, South Korea, Indonesia, Thailand, Japan and Malaysia
into Australia have dropped substantially, according to the
Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS).</P>
      <P>The ABS figures show that tourist arrivals from South Korea led
the plunge with a drop of 66 percent in December 1997 compared to the
year-earlier figure.</P>
      <P>Indonesia ranked second in the drop with 53 percent; followed by
Thailand, 39 percent; Malaysia, 31 percent; Taiwan, 23 percent; the
Philippines, 15 percent; and Japan, 12 percent.</P>
      <P>Tourism industry analysts believe the sharp drop will continue in
the months to come as the Asian crisis shows no clear signs of
ending.</P>
      <P>Earlier this week, the Australian Tourist Commission, which
promotes the tourism industry and lures foreign tourists to
Australia, announced it would spend A$5 million (US$3.4 million) for
a promotional blitz in Taiwan, Hong Kong, South Korea, Indonesia and
three other locations.</P>
      <P>Tourism promoters worry that the decline in tourist numbers could
cost the Australian economy up to A$3.5 billion. Market economists,
however, believe the loss could be about A$1.5 billion.</P>
      <P>"The sharp drop in in-bound tourists is a concrete sign that the
Asian crisis is already having a marked impact on the Australian
economy," said Colonial State Bank chief economist Dr. Craig James.</P>
      <P>"The drop in tourist numbers since July (1997) -- 17 percent in
seasonally adjusted terms -- is the most severe for around nine
years. The last downturn of this magnitude occurred in early 1989
after the 1988 bicentenary celebrations," he added.</P>
      <P>The number of tourist arrivals to Australia dropped by 6 percent
or 20,000 to 328,700 in December 1997 from the month before.</P>

    <DATELINE>Washington,  Feb.  5  (CNA)
(By Jay Chen and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>John Chang, secretary-general of the
Republic of China's ruling Kuomintang, met with mainland Chinese
dissident Wei Jinsheng, who now lives in exile in the United States,
on Thursday in Washington, D.C., and expressed an interest in Wei
visiting Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chang and Wei, both of whom were in town for the annual US
National Prayer Breakfast hosted by President Bill Clinton Thursday
morning, met for a casual talk at a Chinatown restaurant prior to a
dinner meeting Chang hosted there in honor of KMT members and
representatives of the academic and overseas Chinese communities in
the eastern United States. Wei also attended the dinner.</P>
      <P>Wei told Chang that he would likely visit Taiwan in September,
taking advantage of a scheduled trip to Japan at that time. He said,
however, that he would not visit Taiwan at the invitation of any of
the island's political parties.</P>
      <P>Wei, who spent the better part of two decades off-and-on in
mainland Chinese prisons because of his outspokenness, offered some
of his insights concerning relations across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>He blamed mainland China for the standstill in cross-strait
dialogue. Beijing established many prerequisites for the resumption
of talks, he said, because it knew Taipei could not accept them. This
allows mainland China to accuse Taiwan of obstructionism, he noted.</P>
      <P>Wei said that Beijing's motive for setting Taipei up to look
uncooperative is to isolate Taiwan from the international community.
Mainland Chinese authorities "cut off all connections around a rival
before dealing a blow to the opponent," he said.</P>
      <P>He agreed with Taipei's stance that for cross-strait dialogue to
resume, Beijing should first accept the fact that the two sides of
the Taiwan Strait are separate political entities. "Otherwise,
chances for the dialogue to reopen would be slim," he said.</P>
      <P>If the two sides restart the dialogue, he said, they should meet
in a third location. He however warned against holding the talks in
Singapore, saying, "Everybody knows that the city-state is pro-PRC."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chang hinted that the Taipei-headquartered World
League for Freedom and Democracy will probably invite Wei to visit
Taiwan in the second half of this year.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Canada's central bank reiterated Thursday
that inflation control remains a priority for the country, despite
Canada's falling currency and the economic turmoil in Asia.</P>
      <P>"From a monetary policy perspective, the best contribution your
central bank can make to helping the economy cope with external
shocks is to ensure that inflation remains under control," Bank of
Canada Governor Gordon Thiessen told a business group in eastern
Canada.</P>
      <P>"Nothing is as important to investors, especially during
turbulent times, as the assurance that comes from the protection that
low and stable inflation provides for the value of money," he said in
a speech to the Saint John Board of Trade in New Brunswick.</P>
      <P>Thiessen acknowledged that Canada's economic growth this year
will not be as strong as was predicted last fall, partly because of
the continuing economic crisis that began last summer in Thailand and
spread to other Asian countries.</P>
      <P>"Some Canadian regions and industries, particularly those with
heavier reliance on primary commodities and exports to Asia, will no
doubt feel the impact more than others," he noted.</P>
      <P>But he stressed that as a whole, Canada's economic outlook is
"still favorable for continued expansion in output and employment,
and for a further gradual reduction in the margin of unused
capacity."</P>
      <P>The Canadian dollar has recently lost about 5 percent of its

(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The big boys are back. So say stock
analysts and dealers as waves of foreign institutional buying
continue to rack up gains on the Singapore and Malaysian bourses.</P>
      <P>All key indices in Singapore were up Thursday, indicating that
the buying spree was broad-based, The Straits Times said in a market
analysis report Friday.</P>
      <P>The benchmark Straits Times Industrials Index climbed 66.92
points or 4.7 percent to close at 1,492.15 Thursday.</P>
      <P>A vice president of a foreign brokerage in Singapore was quoted
as saying, "Since the Lunar New Year holidays, there has been a real
flow of funds into our stock market from overseas, particularly the
United States."</P>
      <P>The strengthening of regional currencies against the US dollar
was an indication of foreign funds buying into the regional stock
markets, she noted.</P>
      <P>"Funds selling their US dollars and sterling for local currencies
to invest in the stock markets shored up the regional units," she
said.</P>
      <P>The Singapore dollar firmed to 1.663 Thursday from Wednesday's

dollar since the start of the year, from 4.065 previously.</P>
      <P>The Kuala Lumpur Composite Index rose 3.2 percent to 712.81,

    <HEADLINE>OFFICE OCCUPANCY COSTS SET TO BE CHEAPER THIS YEAR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  Feb. 6 (CNA)
(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>It will be cheaper to run an office this
year in the cities most affected by the Asian currency crisis,
according to a new property market survey.</P>
      <P>Southeast Asian capitals such as Kuala Lumpur, Bangkok and
Jakarta -- which saw their currencies depreciate up to 60 percent for
the 12 months to last December -- are likely to experience the
greatest falls in occupancy costs, said the annual survey of such
costs in 74 office districts across 68 cities worldwide.</P>
      <P>The survey, which was conducted in December, showed that Hong
Kong had overtaken Tokyo as the world's most expensive city in terms
of office occupancy costs.</P>
      <P>Hong Kong topped the list with occupancy costs of US$10.11 per
square foot per month (psf pm).</P>
      <P>Rates in the five central wards of Tokyo -- the city's prime
business district -- stood at US$8.64 psf pm, pulling the Japanese
capital down three rungs to fourth position.</P>
      <P>London's West End came in second with an average cost of US$9.18
psf pm, with the City of London third at US$8.69.</P>
      <P>Despite the currency crisis, seven Asian cities were in the top
10. Singapore was ranked ninth at US$5.22 psf pm, and Beijing tenth
at US$4.64.</P>
      <P>The bottom end of the list was dominated mainly by Australian
cities. The cities with the lowest occupancy costs were Perth, with
62 US cents psf a month, and Adelaide, at 78 US cents. The four
property consultancies which conducted the survey were Edmund Tie and
Co. of Singapore, Hong Kong's C.Y. Leung and Co., DTZ Debenham Thorpe
of Britain and CB Commercial of the United States.</P>
      <P>An executive with Edmund Tie and Co. said that because of new
supply as well as demand being affected by what is happening in the
region, "we will expect further consolidation in occupancy costs this
year."</P>
      <P>This will make Asia more competitive as a business region, she
added.</P>
      <P>This is especially so given that the cities largely unaffected by
the fluctuations in regional currencies last year are expected to see
their costs remain stable or firm up, said the survey report,
referring to cities in mainland China, New Zealand and Australia.</P>
      <P>It defined occupancy costs as the average costs, in US dollars,
of leasing new office space in modern office buildings in prime
central business district locations. They include rents and other
expenses like property taxes and maintenance costs.</P>
      <P>In Bangkok, where the devaluation of the baht sparked off a
region-wide sell-off of currencies last year, occupancy costs plunged
56 percent between the end of 1996 and December 1997 to US$1.05 psf
pm, the survey showed.</P>
      <P>In the same period, the Thai unit shed about 45 percent of its
value against the US dollar.</P>
      <P>According to the Singapore consultancy firm, the extent of the
falls in occupancy costs were unavailable, as the latest survey
provided only broad-based indications of cost movements.</P>
      <P>While companies do not look at costs alone when choosing a
location, competitive occupancy costs do make a location more
attractive, it said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Regarding the long-stalled dialogue between
the Taipei-based Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) and its
Beijing-based counterpart, the Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Strait (ARATS), by sending a letter to the SEF last November
and issuing a related news release the same month, ARATS has "contact
again" with the SEF, according to ARATS Vice Chairman Tang Shubei.</P>
      <P>Tang made the comment in an interview published in the February
edition of Cross-Strait Relations, an ARATS journal.</P>
      <P>Upon Beijing's suspension of cross-strait dialogue in 1995, ARATS
wrote to the SEF on June 16 of that year, declaring ARATS would
"contact the SEF when the time is proper," the journal noted.</P>
      <P>Since the SEF proposed last year that SEF Chairman Koo Chen-fu
lead a group to visit Beijing, a response from ARATS would be
appropriate if ARATS is sincere about resuming cross-strait dialogue,
it said.</P>
      <P>Tang pointed out in the interview that ARATS sent a letter on
Nov. 6, 1997 to Chiao Jen-ho, who was then the secretary-general and
vice chairman of the SEF, inviting him to lead a group of directors
and supervisors of the SEF to a symposium titled "Outlooks on
Trans-Century Cross-Strait Economic Relations" and to visit Xiamen,
Shanghai and Beijing later on.</P>
      <P>This was done, Tang said, in order to enhance communications and
exchanges between the two organizations.</P>
      <P>ARATS clarified its stance on Koo's proposed Beijing visit and
the renewal of cross-strait discussions in a news release on Nov. 13,
he added.</P>
      <P>Tang remarked that Taipei authorities should respond clearly on
the issue of political negotiations as soon as possible, and that the
SEF and ARATS should arrange procedural issues for the political
talks at an early date.</P>

      <P>The Taipei-based Straits Exchange Foundation
(SEF) chairman, Koo Chen-fu, on Friday praised Shi Hwei-you, who has
been offered the post of SEF vice chairman and secretary-general, for
his capability in dealing with complicated cross-strait affairs.</P>
      <P>Koo paid the compliment amid an ongoing personnel reshuffle in
the SEF, the quasi-official intermediary body founded to handle
exchanges across the Taiwan Strait in the absence of formal contact
between the Republic of China and mainland China.</P>
      <P>The political heavyweight described Shi as a person who sticks to
his beliefs and principles and said he hopes Shi can also develop a
sense of give and take without sacrificing his uncompromising spirit
during negotiations.</P>
      <P>Koo stressed that the person appointed to be in charge of the
mission to restart cross-strait talks must possess just these
characteristics and capabilities.</P>
      <P>On Saturday, Shi will formally replace Chiao Jen-ho, who has been

appointment, Shi, who currently serves as secretariat
director-general of the ruling Kuomintang, has held positions as vice
chairman of the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) and as
SEF vice secretary-general.</P>
      <P>During several rounds of talks with mainland Chinese officials in
the past, Shi, also an expert in legal affairs, won a reputation as a
tough, uncompromising negotiator.</P>
      <P>With his wide experience of cross-strait affairs, Shi has been
commissioned to mold the SEF and the MAC into virtually two parts of
the same mechanism, in order to execute the government's mainland

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's Aerospace Industrial Development
Corp. (AIDC) and American helicopter giant Sikorsky Co. are slated to
sign a memorandum of understanding for the joint development and
manufacture of S-92 helicopters.</P>
      <P>Relevant sources disclosed Thursday that chairman Tsai Chun-hui
of AIDC -- formerly the military-run Aero-Industry Development
Center, which built Taiwan's locally-designed Indigenous Defense
Fighters (IDFs) -- will lead a Taiwan mission to Sikorsky's
headquarters on Feb. 12 to ink a memorandum of understanding for
business cooperation.</P>
      <P>The memorandum is the follow-up to a pact forging a strategic
business alliance that AIDC and Sikorsky agreed to in October 1997,
the sources noted.</P>
      <P>Test flights of the 20-seat S-92 are scheduled to kick off in the
spring, they said, adding that if everything goes smoothly, mass
commercial production will follow immediately afterward.</P>
      <P>The S-92 helicopter -- which boasts better avionics, cabin
layout, performance and safety features than the earlier S-70 model
-- is being researched and developed in a project directed by
Sikorsky and conducted jointly by experts from Taiwan, the United
States, Japan, Spain, Brazil and mainland China.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's AIDC will be responsible for the most important portion
of the cockpit, 6 percent of the entire development project, while
mainland China is in charge of developing the tail pylon, about 1
percent of the project.</P>
      <P>Sikorsky, an offshoot of United Technology, which is one of the
top 500 enterprises in the United States, is a major manufacturer of
helicopters. In addition to maintaining a liaison office in Taiwan
for the distribution of Sikorsky products, the firm also maintains

    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Feb. 6 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australian farmers, hit by slumping trade
with South Korea, have predicted that there are signs that mainland
China and Hong Kong will have to devalue their currencies in order to
compete with other Asian countries which have seen their currencies
depreciate during the Asian economic crisis.</P>
      <P>They said Australian agriculture is now bracing for the
inevitable inclusion of mainland China and Hong Kong in the Asian
financial meltdown.</P>
      <P>The impact was drawn to the attention of delegates attending the
Outlook 1998 conference in Canberra on Thursday, with a report that
40 containers of processed wool were being shipped back to an
Australian processor from South Korea because of credit difficulties
in that country.</P>
      <P>"Otherwise, other Southeast Asian countries will take an enormous
part of China's export markets -- especially textiles, which account
for a massive 20 percent of China's export income," David Montgomery,
managing director of the Australian division of the US cotton firm
Dunavant Enterprises, told the mass circulation newspaper The Sydney
Morning Herald.</P>
      <P>The Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics
(ABARE) said mainland China and Hong Kong will be under pressure to
devalue their currencies or they will not be able to compete with
other Asian countries.</P>
      <P>ABARE chief commodity analyst Terry Sheales said: "My
understanding is that China's domestic economy is under some
pressure. A resultant reduction in Chinese demand for imported
commodities would have widespread implications for Australia's
economy and world trade generally."</P>
      <P>Montgomery said Indonesia's 350 percent devaluation since August
1997 will make its exports, including textiles, much cheaper and put
"enormous pressure on China and Hong Kong to devalue."</P>

      <P>John Chang, secretary-general of
the Republic of China's ruling Kuomintang (KMT), said on Thursday
that the US Congress is very concerned about developments in
cross-Taiwan Strait ties and the recent elections held in Taiwan, and
that following a meeting with several key Congress figures, he gave
them a detailed explanation of the two issues.</P>
      <P>In addition to Representative Richard K. Armey, Chang also met on
Thursday afternoon with David E. Bonior, minority whip in the House,
Doug Bereuter, chairman of the House Asian-Pacific Affairs Committee,
and John F. Kerry, a Democratic heavyweight at the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee.</P>
      <P>Chang described the four congressmen as very concerned about the

during the prayer breakfast and said that Gingrich promised to visit
Taiwan again if he can find the time.</P>
      <P>Gingrich was quoted by Chang as saying that he found his first
visit to Taiwan in April 1996 as very productive and meaningful.</P>
      <P>Although prominent mainland Chinese dissident Wei Jingsheng also
attended the prayer breakfast, Chang did not actually meet him until
he attended a seminar held by Chang with local Chinese communities at

      <P>Some 600 mainland Chinese who have come to
Taiwan to live with their lineal relatives are currently studying in
local schools and 12 percent of them say they have encountered
difficulties living in Taiwan, an official of the Mainland Affairs
Council (MAC) said on Friday.</P>
      <P>The MAC official said that as of the end of last May, more than
6,000 mainlanders have entered Taiwan under government regulations
allowing mainland Chinese to live in Taiwan with lineal relatives who
are ROC nationals.</P>
      <P>He said that a survey conducted by the MAC shows that 584 of the
mainlanders are currently studying at various levels in schools
around the island, adding that most of them are the grandchildren of
elderly veterans and that 70 percent of them are from Fujian
Province.</P>
      <P>Four hundred and forty-eight of the students are studying at
primary schools, while 110 are junior high school students and 25 are
senior high school or vocational school students. Sixty-nine of the
students said they have encountered difficulties living in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>These difficulties are mostly financial, because most of them are
living on their grandfathers' pensions or have to work part-time to
support themselves. Some of them have had to be referred to social

adjusting to school life in Taiwan.</P>

      <P>Republic of China Premier Vincent Siew said
on Friday that the government, under the principle of mutual benefit,
should promote greater Taiwan investment in Southeast Asian countries
in order to help them recover from their ongoing financial woes.</P>
      <P>Siew said that as a good neighbor to the countries of Southeast
Asia, Taiwan should consider feasible means of helping those
countries recover from the current turmoil, including merging with or
acquiring local enterprises of sound structure and helping Taiwan
businesses interested in investing in the region to join together in
setting up a system of collective holding companies.</P>
      <P>The Central Bank of China, in conjunction with other Taiwan-based
banks and their overseas branches, could consider extending loans to
hard-hit Southeast Asian countries, using international mechanisms
such as the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, and the
International Monetary Fund, he added.</P>
      <P>The premier made the remarks after hearing a report by Council

      <P>The government of the Republic of China will
send a delegation to attend a ceremony at the Vatican on Feb. 21-22
in which Archbishop Paul K.H. Shan of the southern Taiwan city of
Kaohsiung will accept the honor of being elevated to the position of
cardinal by Pope John Paul II, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said
on Friday.</P>
      <P>R.T. Yang, ROC director of European Affairs, said that Pope John
Paul II named Shan as a cardinal on Jan. 18, a move seen by Taipei as
an indication of the importance the Vatican attaches to the
long-lasting relations between the Holy See and the ROC.</P>
      <P>The appointment makes Shan the first Taiwan clergyman to hold the
title of cardinal since the death of Cardinal Yu Pin in 1978. Yu was
raised to the position of cardinal in Nanking on the Chinese mainland
before the ROC government relocated to Taiwan in 1949.</P>
      <P>Yang said that in line with the international practice that the

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 6 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Foreign Minister Jason Hu
revealed on Friday that the foreign ministers of Malawi and Swaziland
will visit Taiwan in April and September, respectively.</P>
      <P>Upon arrival at Chiang Kai-shek International Airport after a
week-long trip to Africa, Hu told reporters that his visits to
Swaziland and Malawi have successfully conveyed to both countries
Taipei's determination to strengthen ties with them.</P>
      <P>He said he was favorably impressed by the host countries' warm
receptions and that he is confident that the island will succeed in
increasing its presence on the African continent.</P>
      <P>However, the foreign minister pointed out that Taiwan's
diplomatic ties with its African allies will thrive even more if they
are based on solid economic and trade ties.</P>
      <P>Referring to a proposed African tour by President Lee Teng-hui,
Hu said the proposal will take a more definite shape after he has
finished his own series of visits to all the ROC's African allies.</P>
      <P>Hu left Taiwan for Swaziland via South Africa on Jan. 31 in a bid
to prevent an African "domino effect" after the Central African
Republic followed South Africa in switching diplomatic recognition to
Beijing on Jan. 29.</P>
      <P>During his two-day stay in Swaziland, he met with King Mswati III
and won his assurance that South Africa and the Central African
Republic's diplomatic reversals will in no way affect his own
country's diplomatic policy .</P>
      <P>At a press conference after the meeting, Mswati reiterated
publicly his assurance that Swaziland is an independent state with
its own foreign policy which is not subject to foreign influence.</P>
      <P>Swaziland Premier Barnabas Sibusico Dlamini echoed the king's
stance. Vowing that the 30-year-old friendship between the two
countries will survive and thrive, he promised that his state will
continue its steadfast support for the Republic of China in
international organizations.</P>
      <P>Malawian President Bakili Muluzi later extended similar
assurances to Hu during his visit there between Feb. 2-6, putting to
rest the ROC's fear that Lilongwe could be lured into Beijing's fold
after the media wrongly quoted Malawian Information Minister San
Mpasu as saying that his country will move toward normalization with
the People's Republic of China.</P>
      <P>Hu has already visited Senegal on a previous African trip, and is
scheduled to visit Chad, Guinea-Bissau, the Gambia, Liberia, Sao Tome
and Principe, and Burkina Faso on his next African trip scheduled for
Feb. 14-22.</P>

President James Mancham, at the invitation of the opposition
Democratic Progressive Party.</P>
      <P>Although Seychelles has no diplomatic relations with the ROC, nor
does its maintain a representative office here, Yang said, the ROC
has some goods friends within the country's ruling and opposition
camps.</P>

      <P>The European Union's executive body is
working on proposals to intensify relations with Beijing and do more
to recognize communist China as a global power, according to reports
from the Geneva-based World Trade Organization (WTO) on Friday.</P>
      <P>"We need to set out our agenda for a more active relationship
with China between now and the end of the century," European Trade
Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan was quoted by the WTO report as saying.</P>
      <P>Brittan said the proposals would be set out in a document from
the European Commission, the EU's executive body, expected to come
out soon, the WTO report pointed out.</P>
      <P>The policy would have to be adopted by the commission and
approved by the EU's 15 member states before it would take effect.</P>
      <P>"There is no alternative to engagement with China, which has
one-fifth of the world's population and a booming economy," Brittan
was quoted as saying.</P>
      <P>The proposed new policy would upgrade and deepen political
dialogue, boost cooperation programs and aim to speed up mainland
China's incorporation into multilateral and international structures.</P>
      <P>"First of all, the European Union needs to do more to recognize
China as a global power," the WTO report quoted Brittan as saying.
"The level of our dialogue should be commensurate with this status."</P>
      <P>Brittan welcomed plans for a first EU-Beijing summit on the
sidelines of a scheduled EU-Asia summit in London in April.</P>
      <P>He said the EU should talk to mainland China on a range of global
issues, from reform of the United Nations to anti-personnel mines.</P>
      <P>However, Brittan said mainland China's conditions for membership
of the WTO still fall far short of what is required, but he added
that European and American leaders could help to bring it
substantially closer, and that a deal might even be clinched this
year, the WTO report added.</P>

      <P>The state-run China Shipbuilding Corp.
(CSBC) on Friday boasted of its ability to build and maintain
submarines, following an announcement by the Defense Ministry that
the ROC plans to develop its own submarines.</P>
      <P>Although the construction of submarines involves technology far
more complicated than that required to build conventional vessels,
the Kaohsiung-based CSBC said it is capable of building and
maintaining such craft.</P>
      <P>However, CSBC sources elaborated, saying the shipyard will limit
itself to building submarine hulls, since the weapons and radar
systems have to be developed or acquired from abroad by the armed

      <P>The sources said that the navy currently uses the company to
build hulls for its conventional warships, while the navy or the
Chungshan Institute of Science and Technology, a state-run institute
for the research and development of weaponry, provides the necessary
combat and navigational equipment.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile the Kaohsiung-based China Steel Corporation (CSC)

      <P>Republic of China President Lee Teng-hui on
Friday repeated his calls for the resumption of cross-Taiwan Strait
negotiations without any preconditions.</P>
      <P>Lee made the call at a dinner party he hosted for over 80 foreign
envoys and their wives at the presidential auditorium. Beijing
unilaterally suspended scheduled talks with Taipei following Lee's

      <P>However, he reiterated Taipei's opposition to Beijing's "one
country, two systems" formula, saying the ROC government expects a
healthy cross-strait relationship under the principles of peace,
cooperation and prosperity so as to help safeguard regional peace and
development.</P>
      <P>The president thanked the foreign ambassadors and representatives
for their contributions to promoting relations between the ROC and
their own countries, and encouraged the international community to
render greater support to the ROC in the year of the tiger, as the
tiger in Chinese mythology is a symbol of the power of justice and

(By Lin Wen-fen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China government's "no
haste, be patient" economic policy toward mainland China investment
has been partly effective, as government-approved investment projects
in the mainland dwindled in magnitude last year, the Ministry of
Economic Affairs (MOEA) said on Friday.</P>
      <P>Tsai Lien-sheng, executive secretary of the MOEA's Investment
Commission, said that a total of 728 mainland-bound investment
projects were approved by the commission in 1997, at a combined value
of US$1.61 billion, representing a 90.08 percent increase in the
number of projects and 31.34 percent growth in total value from the
1996 level.</P>
      <P>Tsai said that although it seems that mainland-bound investment
projects almost doubled last year compared with the previous year,
this is not actually the case.</P>
      <P>In the past, many Taiwan businesses invested in the mainland
without first obtaining government approval, but last April, the
Legislative Yuan passed revised regulations governing cross-strait
relations that stipulate a system of punishment for unapproved
mainland investment, Tsai said, adding that because of this, official
applications for investing in the mainland have increased since then.</P>
      <P>Tsai also pointed out that the average value per project stood at
US$2.22 million last year, representing a significant drop from the
average value of NT$3.21 million registered a year earlier.</P>
      <P>He noted that according to statistics made public by mainland
Chinese authorities, the actual investment value by Taiwan
businessmen between January and September edged down 0.49 percent
from the same period of 1996. During the same period,
mainland-approved investment projects proposed by Taiwan businessmen
decreased by 9.1 percent in number, while the combined investment
value plummeted 54 percent.</P>
      <P>The figures released by the mainland authorities show that
mainland-bound investment projects are decreasing, both in number and
in value, he said.</P>
      <P>Under the "no haste, be patient" policy, the ROC government has
banned projects valued at over US$50 million, as well as large-scale
public construction and infrastructure projects.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US READY TO FINALIZE WTO TALKS WITH ROC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Feb.  6  (CNA)
(By Herman Pan and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Clinton Administration said on
Friday that the United States is ready to finalize bilateral talks
with Taiwan on the island's terms to join the World Trade
Organization (WTO).</P>
      <P>"Yes, we are ready to complete consultations (concerning
Taipei's entry to the WTO)," said an American negoitator with Taiwan,
who spoke on condition of anonymity. "We have high expectations of
the upcoming round of talks."</P>
      <P>The official further said Taiwan could finalize WTO negotiations
with the US ahead of mainland China if it presented commercially
viable or reasonable entry terms.</P>
      <P>The US will separately hold WTO talks with Taipei and Beijing
next week. Assistant Trade Representative Robert Cassidy will head a
delegation to the mainland for bilateral talks, while David Burns, a
senior advisor to the US Trade Representative (USTR), will chair
negotiations with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>USTR officials said Taipei-Washington talks have nothing to do
with Washington-Beijing negotiations. The US won't consider the
pace of its negotiations with Beijing and won't rule out the
possibility of finalizing WTO talks with Taipei during the 17th
round of such consultations scheduled to start on Monday in
Washington, D.C.</P>
      <P>The officials said agricultural trade will be a critical point
whether the upcoming talks can achieve a major breakthrough, adding
that Taiwan must present reasonable timetables for opening its pork,
chicken, rice and animal intestines markets.</P>
      <P>Commenting on reports that Taiwan's husbandry industry operators
have threatened to boycott imports of American grains and soybeans
in protest of US market-opening pressure, the USTR officials said
they believe such a threat was not driven by the Taipei government.
"It's simply a natural reaction," they added.</P>
      <P>The reports concerning Taipei's "boycott" threat have caused
slumps in prices for related products on the Chicago futures market
in the past few days.</P>
      <P>Taipei will send a large delegation of trade and agricultural
officials to Washington for the 17th round of WTO talks. The
first-stage talks will be held on Feb. 9-14, with Vice Economics
Minister Lin Yi-fu heading the Taipei mission, while Economics
Minister Wang Chih-kang will meet with US Trade Representative

    <HEADLINE>SON OF CONVICTED MURDERER APPEALS FOR HELP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Los  Angeles,  Feb. 6 (CNA)
(By Philip Liu &amp; Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The son of Tzuo Ming-hsin, a national
of the Republic of China and a permanent resident of Alaska who was
convicted of first-degree murder there seven years ago and sentenced
to 198 years in prison, on Friday called for financial aid to help
his father's cause.</P>
      <P>Tzuo Tzu-cheng, son of the convicted murderer, called a press
conference to appeal for donations from Chinese communities on the US
West Coast and elsewhere so he can hire US-based lawyers to help his
father get another chance at justice.</P>
      <P>Tzuo Ming-hsin, a cook, was arrested on charges of the murder of
a Chinese man and the man's daughter in 1989. A jury found him guilty
in 1991 of first-degree murder and sentenced him to 198 years in
prison.</P>
      <P>The prisoner's sister, Tzuo Hsiao-ling, and three attorneys --
including Charles Mathews, a noted Pasadena-based criminal-case
lawyer -- were also present at the press conference.</P>
      <P>Mathews noted Tzuo was convicted on the basis of a tape recording
but said that he has found other clear sounds on the tape that show
that the murder was committed not by Tzuo but by one or more others.</P>
      <P>Another problem with the trial, he said, is that Tzuo never had
the opportunity to testify for himself and say, "I'm not guilty."</P>
      <P>The California attorney said he is willing to be Tzuo's defense
lawyer and to investigate the case.</P>
      <P>Chinese-American lawyer Yu-Tai Lin-chang, who has fought for Tzuo
for months, hoped that Tzuo will end his fast in his prison cell,
saying that the hunger strike won't help solve problems. She urged
Tzuo to stay healthy and cooperate with his lawyers.</P>
      <P>Yu-Tai also stressed that there were many faults in the case and
trial, including that Tzuo was denied his right to express himself
during the trial; that the tape, the only evidence, was made by
Chiang Meng-jo, a man with a criminal record who was acting under
police instructions; and that the Alaskan police decided Tzuo was the
guilty party after only one day and without investigating anyone
else.</P>
      <P>It is also unbelievable that the Alaskan court could have
convicted Tzuo only on the basis of a tape without having physical
evidence such as the murder weapon, fingerprints or blood stains, she
said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ACER INVESTS IN JOINT VENTURE PC ASSEMBLY PLANT IN TURKEY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ankara, Feb. 6 (CNA)
(By C.H. Kuo &amp; Lin Wen-fen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's Acer Group and Turkey's Ihlas Group
on Friday announced a US$1.5 million joint venture in a personal
computer assembly plant in Istanbul.</P>
      <P>Under the agreement signed Friday, Acer Group will hold a 49
percent stake in the joint venture, while Ihlas Group will hold 51
percent. The assembly plant is to produce 3,000 personal computers
per year with components and parts imported from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The Ihlas-Acer computer company will employ 85 staff members for
the assembly plant in Kozyatagi, Istanbul. With the the establishment
of the assembly plant, the sales turnover of the company for this
year is estimated at US$35 million and is expected to climb to US$100
million by 2000.</P>
      <P>Acer, the fifth largest computer manufacturer in the world, is
the first international computer giant to team up with the Turkish
enterprise to produce personal computers. Acer is also the first
foreign investor in Turkey since the outbreak of financial turmoil
that has swept the Asian area.</P>
      <P>Acer made inroads into the Turkish market in 1996, when it
appointed Ihlas as its agent to sell its "Aspire" personal computers.
Acer President Stan Shih visited Turkey in September the same year.</P>
      <P>The sales volume of Aspire personal computers stood at some 5,000
units at a combined valued of US$18 million last year, accounting for
1.6 percent of the Turkish market. Ihlas-Acer hopes to gain a 5
percent market share this year.</P>
      <P>Turkey's largest personal computer maker is Escort, which has a
sales turnover surpassing US$100 million.</P>
      <P>Ihlas, which employs over 25,000 people, is one of the largest
business groups in Turkey. The group operates in a variety of
sectors, including books, printing, mass media, home appliances,
cars, beverages, banking and finance. The group has cooperative
relations with several other famous car and home appliance makers in
South Korea and Japan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN DELEGATION FAVORABLY IMPRESSED BY BAYER'S SAFETY MEASURES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 7 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Taiwan delegation visiting chemical giant
Bayer's German headquarters at Dormagen was favorably impressed
Friday by the company's safety precautions in producing Toluene
diisocyanate (TDI) and said the opposition to the firm's proposed
mega-investment project in Taiwan was ill-advised.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Provincial Assemblyman Sung Ai-ke, a member of the
delegation consisting of assemblymen, industrial experts and
academics, told a CNA reporter in Taipei on the telephone that
phosgene, a poisonous gas necessary for the production of TDI, is not
so terrible as those who oppose Bayer's Taiwan investment claim,
especially if handled appropriately.</P>
      <P>The New Party assemblyman predicted that the Taiwan Provincial
Assembly will approve a land-lease contract for Bayer on Feb. 16,
assuming that the ruling Kuomintang can get its deputies to back the
party's pro-Bayer stance.</P>
      <P>In addition to using double-walled pipes and containers to
transfer and store the gas, Bayer surrounds that plumbing with
ammonia vapor, which would react with any leaking phosgene and
transform it into poison-free urea, said Sung.</P>
      <P>He doubted the claims by opponents of the project that phosgene
is so poisonous that a leak would kill everyone within 20 km of the
plant.</P>
      <P>A local daily, the United Daily News, quoted a Bayer official as
saying in Dormagen Friday that phosgene could pose a risk only to
people within a three-km radius of the plant, while the company's
proposed plant in Taichung, central Taiwan, would be a safe four km
from the nearest residential area.</P>
      <P>Even Chou Ching-yu, an assemblywoman with the opposition
Democratic Progressive Party who had been skeptical about the
proposed plant's safety, echoed Sung's support after visiting Bayer's
German headquarters, according to the daily.</P>
      <P>She blamed Taiwan authorities for the level of opposition to the
project, saying that if they had shown enough credibility in the
past, the anti-Bayer campaign would not have grown so large.</P>
      <P>The daily also quoted Horst Mueck, chairman of Bayer Taiwan Co.,
as telling Sung that his company would provide the maximum
compensation called for by local rules for any damage caused by an
accident at its Taiwan plant, stressing that such problems would be
extremely unlikely.</P>
      <P>He also promised Sung that the plant would be shut down in case
of any major industrial accident.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taichung County Magistrate Liao Yung-lai, who came to
power in November's election on the strength of the anti-Bayer group,
said he will conduct opinion polls on the issue and submit the
results to the Provincial Assembly before it votes on Bayer's
land-leasing contract.</P>
      <P>Liao, a leader of the local anti-Bayer league, said he will carry
out his campaign promise to put the issue to the people but that a
referendum takes time to prepare and so will not be held before the
Feb. 16 assembly vote.</P>
      <P>Bayer began its negotiations with Taiwan authorities in 1995 for
the NT$49.2 billion (US$1.5 billion) plant in Taichung Harbor with a
capacity of producing 100,000 tons of TDI a year.</P>
      <P>But the project was hit by opposition from local
environmentalists, and the Taiwan Provincial Assembly delayed its
vote on Bayer's land-leasing contract on Dec. 18, after Liao was
elected magistrate.</P>
      <P>The Provincial Assembly will open debate on the contract again on
Feb. 16 as to whether to allow Bayer to construct the plant on a plot
of government-owned land.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING MISINTERPRETS SEF'S PERSONNEL RESHUFFLE: SHEU KE-SHENG</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 7 (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Beijing is wrong to see the recent personnel
reshuffle at the Taipei-based Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) as an
attempt by Taipei to delay the resumption of cross-strait talks, Sheu
Ke-sheng, vice chairman of the cabinet-level Mainland Affairs
Council, said Friday.</P>
      <P>Since dialogue across the Taiwan Strait has proceeded under a
systemic framework, discussions between the two sides will therefore
not be affected by the shuffle of personnel at the SEF, he said,
adding that there is no need for misunderstanding.</P>
      <P>The directors and supervisors of the SEF held a provisional
meeting on Saturday morning to approve the nomination of Shi
Hwei-you, who currently serves as director-general of the ruling
Kuomintang's Secretariat, to replace Chiao Jen-ho as vice chairman
and secretary-general of the SEF.</P>
      <P>Beijing responded to the news of the change at the SEF by
accusing Taipei of trying to delay the resumption of cross-strait
dialogue.</P>
      <P>Shi's role and functions in the SEF will be the same as those of
all others who have held the secretary-general's post in the past,
Sheu stressed.</P>
      <P>When asked how the government would respond if the SEF's
Beijing-based counterpart, the Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Strait (ARATS), invites Shi to visit mainland China, Sheu said
Taipei would weigh the matter carefully.</P>
      <P>As to whether Taipei would insist that SEF Chairman Koo Chen-fu
lead the delegation to the Chinese mainland, Sheu remarked that the
SEF is still waiting for a formal response from ARATS to a proposal
that Koo go to mainland, and that Taipei's reaction will hinge on
ARATS' reply.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT LEE BACKS 'GET UP SIGN UP' CAMPAIGN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  7  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Lee Teng-hui on Saturday threw
his support for a "Get Up Sign Up" signature campaign launched by the
Amnesty International (AI) to promote human rights protection around
the world.</P>
      <P>President Lee signed his name on a declaration initiated
by the London-based human rights promotion organization and pledged
to do everything in his power to ensure that the rights set forth in
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights become a reality
throughout the world.</P>
      <P>During his talks with senior AI Taiwan branch executives,
including honorary Chairman Po Yang and Chairperson Lin Min-tse,
Lee said human rights are universal world values and that respecting
human rights is an important symbol of a modern civilized country.</P>
      <P>"Human rights are inherent," Lee said, adding that all people
around the world should enjoy basic human rights, regardless of their
nationalities or geographic locations.</P>
      <P>He also pointed out that the ROC government has spared no efforts
to protect basic human rights over past years. "We'll continue to do
our best to protect and safeguard basic rights and realize the goals
set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights."</P>
      <P>The Amnesty International launched a global "Get Up Sign Up"
signature campaign on Dec. 10, 1997 to enlist support for
further improving human rights conditions around the world.</P>
      <P>"The drive is aimed at collecting signatures of political and
business leaders, social celebrities and general members of the
public worldwide to push for realization of various
fundamental rights set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights," said Po Yang, honorary chairman of the AI Taiwan branch, who
was jailed for nearly 10 years for political dissent in the 1970s
when Taiwan was still under martial law.</P>
      <P>The AI Taiwan branch is responsible for collecting signatures on
the island. The campaign started here on Saturday. In addition to
President Lee, several senior government officials, including Huang
Kun-hui, secretary-general to the President, Ding Mou-shih,
secretary-general of the National Security Council, and Minister of
Foreign Affairs Jason Hu, have also signed their names to signify
the ROC government's support for the drive. The local signature
campaign will last until November.</P>
      <P>The AI headquarters will present signatures collected
worldwide to the United Nations during a meeting to be held in Paris
on Dec. 10 to mark the 50th anniversary of the issue of the
UN-sponsored Universal Declaration of Human Rights.</P>
      <P>Top leaders from more than 10 countries have thrown their
support behind the campaign. US President Bill Clinton said late
last year that human rights protection should be the cornerstone of
the US diplomatic policy forever. Russia has declared 1998 as its
"year for human rights."</P>

    <HEADLINE>SEF HEAD HOPES FOR BLOSSOMING OF CROSS-STRAIT TIES IN SPRING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 7 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's top negotiator with mainland China
said on Saturday that he hopes that the current impasse across the
Taiwan Strait will be dispelled soon, just as the blossoms of spring
follow the chill of winter.</P>
      <P>C.F. Koo, chairman of the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF),
Taiwan's quasi-official organization authorized to handle exchanges
across the Taiwan Strait, hoped that the SEF, under the guidance and
supervision of the cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC), will
continue functioning as an intermediary body for better cross-strait
relations.</P>
      <P>Koo expressed the wish in a provisional meeting of the SEF board
of directors. During the meeting, the 37 board members unanimously
passed the resignation of SEF Vice Chairman and Secretary-General
Chiao Jen-ho, who was appointed head of the Overseas Chinese Affairs
Commission in the latest reshuffle of the Cabinet, and the
appointment of Shi Hwei-you to succeed Chiao.</P>
      <P>Shi is actually returning to his previous workplace. Before he
became director-general of the ruling Kuomintang's Department of
Secretariat, he was legal advisor to the SEF and the organization's
deputy secretary-general.</P>
      <P>Shi, trained as a judge, earned a reputation as a tough
negotiator by refusing to budge during 16 rounds of talks with his
mainland Chinese counterparts.</P>
      <P>During the board meeting, Koo stressed that the SEF and the MAC,
virtually two sides of one mechanism, should work and cooperate
closely with each other for the sake of the interest of all Chinese
people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The top task of the SEF is to negotiate and to coordinate, Koo
said, adding that only when the two sides of the Taiwan Strait sit
down and talk together will there be hope for peace.</P>
      <P>Koo also urged Beijing's leaders to respect the agreements and
consensus reached with Taiwan several years ago.</P>
      <P>Despite the fact that the two sides reached a consensus on a
"separate interpretation" of the use of the term "one China" and
scored eight agreements on technical issues during previous
preparatory meetings, Koo said Beijing turned down the holding of the
long-planned second meeting between Koo and his mainland counterpart,
Wang Daohan, in 1994, claiming "the atmosphere for talks wasn't
good."</P>

    <HEADLINE>FOREIGN TRADE VOLUME IN JANUARY DROPS FROM ONE YEAR AGO</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  7  (CNA)
(By Lin Wen-fen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's foreign trade volume in January
stood at US$15.12 billion, the lowest level since March 1996,
according to statistics compiled by the Finance Ministry.</P>
      <P>Taiwan exported US$7.63 billion worth of goods in January, down
26.3 percent from the same period of last year, while imports also
decreased 19.4 percent to US$7.49 billion.</P>
      <P>This brought Taiwan a trade surplus of US$140 million in January,
significantly less than the US$1.06 billion surplus registered in
January 1997.</P>
      <P>An official with the Finance Ministry on Saturday attributed the
low export-and-import volume to the Chinese Lunar New Year holidays,
which this year began at the end of January.</P>
      <P>The official pointed out the trade surplus in January, though a
drop from the same period of last year, was an increase from last
December's US$80 million.</P>
      <P>He cited the US$3.99 billion trade deficit Taiwan suffered with
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) -- the island's
first such deficit with ASEAN since 1990 -- and a sharp decrease of
up to 141 percent in Taiwan's exports to South Korea due to the sharp
depreciation of the South Korean won as the two main reasons behind
the drop in the island's trade surplus.</P>
      <P>He predicted that Taiwan's two-way trade will continue to grow
stably this year since the economic situations in Taiwan and other
economic powers are improving.</P>

    <HEADLINE>POLL FINDS DECLINING GOVERNMENT APPROVAL RATING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  7  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government's approval rating has
declined over the past year, with the public most dissatisfied with
worsening social order, according to a public opinion poll released
by the private 21ST Century Foundation on Saturday.</P>
      <P>The telephone poll of 1,069 adults, conducted on Dec. 8-9, 1997,
found that the government's overall approval rating dropped from
73.84 points recorded in the foundation's 1996 survey to last year's
72.34 points.</P>
      <P>The rating plunged most significant in the category of social
order, according to the poll. In the 1996 survey, about 74 percent
of the respondents said they were satisfied with the government's
performance in maintaining law and order, but only 30 percent gave
the thumbs up to the government's performance in this regard last
year.</P>
      <P>The poll found that 65.8 percent were dissatisfied with the
government's inability to curb the crime rate, up from 19.1 percent
recorded in the previous survey.</P>
      <P>Poll results also showed that public dissatisfaction with the
government's diplomatic policy and mainland policy as well as its
performance in improving welfare services and narrowing the gap
between the rich and the poor all shot up, while the approval ratings
for these aspects all plunged.</P>
      <P>For instance, only 40 percent said they were satisfied with the
government's foreign policy, down from 56 percent recroded
in the 1996 survey. Meanwhile, the percentage of critics to the
country's foreign policy increased from 27 percent to 43 percent.</P>
      <P>The government managed to post slight gains in approval ratings
for environmental protection and national security.</P>
      <P>Accroding to the poll, only 46 percent were satisfied with the
performance of various cabinet ministers and 58 percent said they
don't believe what many high-ranking government officials have said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 48 percent said they were satisfied with the
general performance of all government employees, compared to 35
percent who said they were dissatisfied with their performance.</P>
      <P>Only 22 percent were satisifed with the performance of
the country's judges, compared to 26 percent of naysayers.
As high as 59 percent of those surveyed said they were
dissatisfied with the performance of legislators, while only 25
percent gave the thums up.</P>
      <P>As high as 74 percent of the respondents said they think
political graft or corruption is rampant in Taiwan, and 47 percent
said the government often gives the top priority to partisan
interests in making decisions on major policy issues.</P>
      <P>On relations with mainland China, nearly 58 percent said they
prefer to maintain the status quo; 7.5 percent said they hope Taiwan
would declare independence as soon as possible; 3.3 percent said
they look forward to see national reunification in the near
future.</P>
      <P>The poll also found that 35 percent of the respondents said they
think they are Taiwanese; 34 percent said they consider they are both
Taiwanese and Chinese; and 22 percent said they think they are
Chinese.</P>
      <P>Despite a decline in political satisfaction, 63.4 percent of the
respondents still said they are confident in Taiwan's future,
according to the survey.</P>
      <P>Legislator Kao Yu-jen, who concurrently serves as chairman of
the 21ST Century Foundation, said poll results show that local
people are most concerned about social order, environmental
protection, welfare services and equitable distribution of wealth.
The newly installed Cabinet should redouble efforts in these aspects
in order to meet the public demand.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's housing market, which has been in a
slump for more than eight years, is facing its worst prospects in
recent decades with the announcement that a horde of local banks will
increase their interest rates.</P>
      <P>Higher interest rates will make it more difficult for the
sluggish housing industry to move ahead, insiders complained.</P>
      <P>To stimulate sales, real estate companies are now offering
previously unheard of incentives, including a BMW for an order at a
resort in Taoyuan County.</P>
      <P>Incentives elsewhere include free interior decorations and a
complete set of household electrical appliances with the purchase of
an apartment in Tamshui, Taipei County. In Yangmei, a suburb of
Taoyuan, one developer is offering to let buyers move in after making
a down payment of only 10 percent of the home's cost, while arranging

    <HEADLINE>KMT, NEW PARTY SEE FALLING SUPPORT RATES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  7  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Both the ruling Kuomintang and the minor
opposition New Party have seen their support rates decline over the
past year, while the main opposition Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) has managed to post a gain in its support rate, according to a
public opinion poll released on Saturday.</P>
      <P>The telephone survey of 1,069 adults, conducted by the private
21ST Century Foundation on Dec. 8-9, 1997, found that 27.3 percent of
the respondents said they hope the KMT will remain in power, down
from 38.8 percent recorded in the foundation's 1996 poll.</P>
      <P>In contrast, 15 percent said they look forward to seeing the
pro-Taiwan independence DPP rise to power, compared to only 8
percent who pinned their hope on the party in the previous survey.</P>
      <P>The poll also found that only 2.7 percent of those surveyed
said they hope to see the pro-reunification New Party take the helm
of the country, down from 5.3 percent registered in the 1996 poll.</P>
      <P>Asked about which party they support, 22.3 percent said they
support the KMT, down from 31.3 percent found in the 1996 poll; the
DPP's support rate rose from 14.4 percent to 19.1 percent; while the
New Party's support rate dropped to 4.8 percent from 9.9 percent.</P>
      <P>Kao Yu-jen, a KMT legislator who also serves as chairman of the
21ST Century Foundation, said the rise in the DPP's support rate may
be related to the party's landslide win in last November's mayoral
and county magistrate elections.</P>
      <P>Responding to the findings of the poll, New Party Legislator Lin
Yu-fang said New Party politicians should speak more about
public policies and should reduce talks about promoting
reunification of the two sides of the Taiwan Strait in order
to win more popular support.</P>
      <P>Lin attributed the increase in the DPP's support rate to its
reduction in advocating Taiwan independence and to the departure of
a group of radical independence activists from the party. "These two
developments have helped the DPP to win increasing support from
middle-class voters," he noted.</P>
      <P>Lin further said the New Party, which was founded by a group of
maverick KMT politicians a few years ago, should follow suit in
order to win the support of voters who prefer to maintain the
political status quo.</P>
      <P>He also said the New Party should intensify contacts with
grass-roots communities in southern or rural parts of the island in
order to root itself firmly in Taiwan. Otherwise, he said, the party
may not be able to increase its seats in the Legislative Yuan in the
year-end election.</P>

    <HEADLINE>JOHN CHANG URGES BEIJING TO RECOGNIZE POLITICAL REALITIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Boston,  Feb.  6  (CNA)
(By David Wang &amp; Lin Wen-fen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>John Chang, secretary-general of the
Republic of China's ruling Kuomintang, on Friday said that mainland
China should recognize and accept the fact that the ROC is an
independent and sovereign state.</P>
      <P>Chang made the remarks during a speech he gave at Harvard
University on cross-strait relations between 1987 and 1997." He also
stressed that the eventual reunification of the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait can only be achieved gradually.</P>
      <P>Ever since ROC President Chiang Ching-kuo lifted the ban on
visits by Taiwan people to the mainland in 1987, not long before his
death, economic, trade and cultural exchanges between the two sides
of the Taiwan Strait have greatly increased, Chang said.</P>
      <P>In the past 10 years, Taiwan has done much more for promoting
cross-strait exchanges than the mainland authorities, he said, adding
that only because of security concerns does the ROC government
restrict visits to Taiwan by mainland Chinese.</P>
      <P>Chang told his audience of some 100 people that the two sides of
the Taiwan Strait conducted 20 rounds of talks between 1991 and 1995,
when mainland authorities unilaterally suspended the discussions in
protest against ROC President Lee Teng-hui's visit to the United
States in June that year.</P>
      <P>He also noted that in the days leading up to the March 1996 ROC
presidential election, the mainland authorities staged war games in
waters near Taiwan to deter what they called mounting
"pro-independence" sentiment on the island.</P>
      <P>Chang called Beijing's accusations against Taiwan "groundless,"
pointing out that the ROC government has never supported "two
Chinas", "one China, one Taiwan", or "Taiwan independence."</P>
      <P>He stressed that the ROC is willing to resume cross-strait talks
but said that the dialogue must be conducted without any
preconditions. The ROC also insists that the two sides should discuss
practical issues first and then political ones, he said.</P>
      <P>Chang reiterated the ROC's stance that Beijing's attempt to use
the "one country, two systems" scheme as a paradigm for national
reunification is totally unacceptable, adding that unlike Hong Kong,
the ROC is a sovereign state.</P>
      <P>In a recent survey, 48 percent of those polled said that they
would like the two sides of the Taiwan Strait to maintain the status
quo, he noted.</P>
      <P>Chang cited another survey whose results showed that for the
first time more people in the ROC identified themselves as
"Taiwanese" than as "Chinese" -- by 55 percent to 33 percent,
respectively.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's democratic achievement, he said, is the island's most
powerful trump card in dealing with mainland China. He went on to say
that though the two sides of the Taiwan Strait both use the
expression "one China," Beijing does so in "present tense," while
Taipei uses "future tense."</P>
      <P>In his speech, Chang called on US friends to continue to lend
their support to the ROC. He said that the ROC will carry on its
democratic reforms and is willing to reopen talks with mainland China
at any time if Beijing does not set preconditions for the talks.</P>

Friday, with the weighted price index climbing 139.32 points to
close at 8,683.46.</P>
      <P>Market analysts attributed the rise in part to an overnight gain

      <P>A total of 2.75 billion shares changed hands during the two-hour
weekend trading session, with turnover reaching NT$186.97 billion
(US$5.69 billion). The trading volume was among the highest for

    <HEADLINE>DAILY EXPOUNDS WHY ASIA'S 'CRONY CAPITALISM' FALLING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  Feb.  6  (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>It's becoming increasingly clear that the
financial meltdown in Southeast Asia represents the economic
equivalent of the end of the Cold War and of the demolition of the
Berlin Wall, a Canadian columnist said Friday.</P>
      <P>Market capitalism is triumphing over state capitalism, claimed
Richard Gwyn of The Toronto Star. Once, there was an "Asian model."
Since the meltdown, however, this has been castigated as "crony
capitalism" -- insiders building up fortunes through their political
and banking connections, Gwyn noted.</P>
      <P>The essence of the Asian model, supported by so-called "Asian
values," was a system of lifelong employment, he said.</P>
      <P>Now the Asian model is being turned into a variation of the
Anglo-Saxon model, he said. In all Southeast Asian countries,
unemployment is rising toward unprecedented levels, he pointed out.</P>
      <P>Gwyn said it's just being realized in Asia that the obverse side
of the system of lifelong employment is lifelong unemployment. It's
also being realized that the system of lifelong employment has meant
that none of these countries (except Japan) has any program of
unemployment insurance to sustain workers when they are in-between
jobs.</P>
      <P>Lifelong employment, he said, can only work if the economy is
growing rapidly or when recessions only last a year or two, as in
Japan during the "oil shock" of the mid-1970s.</P>
      <P>All Southeast Asian countries, though, are undergoing a
fundamental economic change that will last for years, according to
Gwyn.</P>
      <P>Thus, he continued, one radical political change only now being
considered in Southeast Asia is to create procedures to enable
companies that have failed to go bankrupt.</P>
      <P>There's no question that Southeast Asian countries, with their
resource of well-educated, hard-working and low-paid workers, will
eventually make the economic transition, he said.</P>
      <P>But once they do, they're going to emerge as different kinds of
societies -- "far less distinctively Asian and far more like the rest
of us (in the West)," he concluded.</P>

      <P>Some Asian embassies in Canberra, hit by
economic troubles at home, are set to water down their cocktail
parties as a result of budget cuts, according to a survey by the mass
circulation newspaper, The Australian.</P>
      <P>The daily reported on Saturday that the days of hors d'oeuvres
and champagne will be gone at the embassies of Thailand, Malaysia,
the Philippines and possibly Indonesia because of budget cuts from
their countries.</P>
      <P>The daily quoted Malaysian high commissioner Dato Adnan Othman as
saying that his embassy will cancel the annual Malaysian National Day
reception.</P>
      <P>The Indonesian embassy is expected to follow suit. Five of its
staff members have already been recalled to Jakarta due to budget
cuts.</P>
      <P>Filipino Ambassador Dealia Albert said: "This year is our
centennial of independence from Spain and, of course, we would like
proper celebrations. But we have to do it within constraints."</P>
      <P>Thai diplomats are not being replaced when their postings end.
And they are required to reduce spending on their lifestyles, taking
a 30 percent cut in their accommodation allowances after their
current leases run out, according to the daily.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AUSTRALIA TO REFORM MEASURES FOR ENTRY OF SKILLED MIGRANTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Feb.  7 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Australian government will introduce
new measures in which the approval of entry for new skilled migrants
will be based not only on English proficiency but also on capital
backing, according to the Department of Immigration and Ethnic
Affairs.</P>
      <P>Immigration Minister Philip Ruddock said skilled immigrants could
be denied entry to Australia unless they have capital backing, which
is expected to be in the amount of tens of thousands or even hundreds
of thousands of dollars.</P>
      <P>This is being done, he explained, so Australia would know the
immigrants would not have to rely on social welfare during their
first two years in the country.</P>
      <P>The department has sharply reduced the intake of immigrants to
68,000 in 1997-98 from almost 100,000 in 1996-97.</P>
      <P>Ruddock said the reform is in the nation's interest and will keep
new skilled migrants "away from welfare dependency."</P>
      <P>"I think that one of the major problems that we have experienced
in relation to the ... ugly immigration debate that we have seen is
because people have lost confidence in the way the program was being
conducted," he said.</P>
      <P>As for independent migrants and those wishing to reunite with
family members, Ruddock said his department has yet to decide whether
the requirement of capital backing would apply to them as well.</P>
      <P>Australia has been hit by budget deficits for a number of years,
partly because of rising generous welfare payments to new immigrants.</P>
      <P>The budget deficits have boosted the country's foreign debt. The
Australian government wants to change the situation so that it can
reduce spending and achieve a budget surplus in the coming years.</P>
      <P>The new measures will be introduced on July 1.</P>

      <P>A leading Australian carmaker and its
partner, General Motors of the United States, will invest A$1.4
billion (US$952 million) to increase car production for export to
Asia, including Taiwan and Japan, the Middle East and Latin America.</P>
      <P>Company chairman Jim Weimels said the new investment will help
increase annual production of the company to between 150,000 and
160,000 units a year, up from 123,450 in 1997.</P>
      <P>He said he anticipated an initial volume of 5,000 cars a year for
export to the Middle East, rising to 15,000 in the future. The
long-term sales potential in Latin America will be around 6,000 a
year, while the target for exports to Asia will be about 10,000.</P>
      <P>Last year, Australia was allowed for the first time to sell 2,000
cars to Taiwan alone, and the number will be increased to 6,000 units
a year after Taiwan joins the World Trade Organization.</P>
      <P>The Australian-US joint venture will carry the Australian name of
Holden, one of the best-selling cars in Australia. Holden reached a
peak of 86,000 cars a year in 1971 during its last big export drive,
when its vehicles were sold to 73 markets worldwide.</P>
      <P>But Holden began losing its markets to Japanese cars after that

      <P>Los Angeles isn't the only city that
will be throwing a big party on Oscar night. Films fans in 31 cities
across the United States will celebrate the 70th Academy Awards in
high style March 23.</P>
      <P>For the fifth year in a row, thousands of people will help raise
money for various charities at Academy-sanctioned Oscar Night America
fundraising galas.</P>
      <P>"Over the years we have observed that there were hundreds of
charity fund raisers taking place on Oscar Night," said Rick
Robertson, executive administrator of the Academy.</P>
      <P>"We developed Oscar Night America as a way for at least some of
those events to benefit by a relationship with the big show out here.
Receiving official Oscar Night America status seems to make their
parties just a bit more special and make people nationwide really
feel part of the excitement happening at our awards presentation in
Los Angeles," he said.</P>
      <P>Only one charity party in a given city may participate in Oscar
Night America. Events are produced entirely by local non-profit
charitable organizations, with the active participation of the local
ABC Television Network affiliate station. All of the money raised
remains with the sponsoring charity.</P>
      <P>The Academy provides official Oscar Night America parties with
the same printed Academy Awards programs as those handed out at the
awards presentation in Los Angeles.</P>
      <P>Oscar Night America began in 1994 with parties in two cities,
Minneapolis and San Francisco. By 1996, the program had grown to 12
cities. Events vary from black tie galas to less formal dinners.</P>

ROC should develop a more comprehensive understanding of the term
`Taiwan,' and realize that it is not equal to the `Republic of
Taiwan.' No one can deny the reality that the ROC on Taiwan is an
independent sovereignty," he noted.</P>
      <P>The KMT secretary-general called on all ROC nationals residing
abroad not to dance to Beijing's tune or the tune of the proponents
of Taiwan independence, emphasizing that the pragmatic foreign
policies adopted by the ROC government, including its "no haste, be
patient" policy governing Taiwan investment in mainland China, is
aimed at securing Taiwan's survival and continued development.</P>
      <P>Elaborating on his policy, described as "using war to stop war,"
which he espoused while serving as ROC foreign minister before
assuming his current post, Chang said it is out of the question that
the hegemonic Beijing regime will give way to Taiwan's international
presence, and only brave confrontation of the Chinese communists'
bullyragging will guarantee the nation's survival.</P>
      <P>Addressing the current political situation in Taiwan, Chang said
the KMT would welcome former justice minister and minister without
portfolio Ma Ying-jeou to run in the next election for Taipei mayor
if Ma decides he wishes to.</P>
      <P>Ma, who has since returned to work in the academic sector, is
widely regarded as the KMT's most competent rival to incumbent Mayor
Chen Shui-bian of the main opposition Democratic Progressive Party.</P>
      <P>Chang is scheduled to return to Taipei on Monday via Los Angeles.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NEW PARTY DELEGATION HEADS FOR MAINLAND CHINA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  8 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A delegation composed of 25 public opinion
leaders belonging to the opposition New Party will depart on Monday
for mainland China for an eight-day visit.</P>
      <P>H.S. Feng, a National Assembly deputy and spokesman for the
delegation, said the New Party is willing to play the role of
"mediator" in cross-strait relations, "navigator for China's eventual
unification," and "protector of Taiwan business," at a time when
Taiwan's relations with mainland China remain sluggish.</P>
      <P>According to Feng, the visit was prompted by an invitation from
the mainland-based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait
(ARATS), which sent him a letter on Jan. 26 inviting him and his
"friends of the New Party" to take part in a seminar on cross-strait
ties slated for early February.</P>
      <P>As it is the first invitation ever extended by ARATS to a Taiwan
political party since the release of mainland China President Jiang
Zemin's "eight-point" statement in January 1995, Feng said, the
delegation's visit carries historic significance and reflects the
mainland's sincerity in finding solutions to Taiwan business
interests there.</P>
      <P>Feng expressed the hope that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait
will engage in negotiation instead of confrontation and replace
hatred with communication. Claiming that the New Party is the only
political party in Taiwan which advocates China's unification, he
said the New Party's officeholders should be brave in injecting a new
lease of hope to the present stalemate in cross-strait ties.</P>
      <P>The delegation, which considers itself the "voice of the Taiwan
people," will speak out in the interest of the people of Taiwan at
the seminar scheduled to take place on Tuesday, he said, adding that
the purpose of the visit should not be tainted by attacks from rival
political parties.</P>
      <P>According to Feng, the group will also meet officials of mainland
China's State Department and the mainland's top negotiator with
Taiwan, ARATS Chairman Wang Daohan.</P>

(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Singapore has backed Malaysia's proposal
for ASEAN countries to use their own currencies for regional trade,
Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said in Singapore on
Saturday.</P>
      <P>After a two-hour lunch meeting with Singapore Prime Minister Goh
Chok Tong, Mahathir said that he and Goh agreed that the region's
central bank governors should meet to flesh the idea out.</P>
      <P>The two leaders also discussed the regional financial crisis and
bilateral matters.</P>
      <P>Mahathir's visit was part of a regional trip which included
visits to Thailand and the Philippines, to discuss the regional
currency crisis with his ASEAN counterparts.</P>
      <P>Referring to an earlier meeting, Mahathir said: "I met Goh only a
few weeks back and we agreed to work together. Today, we went into
greater detail about how we can cooperate, in particular with regard
to the economic problem and currency turmoil, and what role Singapore
can have on investments in Malaysia."</P>
      <P>He added that they had agreed about the use of "our own
currencies" for trade between ASEAN countries, and the need to have a
meeting of governors of the respective central banks to work this
out.</P>
      <P>It was reported that last Friday, after meeting Thai Prime
Minister Chuan Leekpai in Bangkok, Mahathir said the ASEAN countries
were hoping to introduce a single regional currency similar to the
euro, which is to be launched next year in Europe.</P>
      <P>This, he added, would be a long-term solution to reduce
dependence on the US dollar, conserve foreign exchange reserves and
cushion the effects of currency speculation, which he said sparked
off the current crisis.</P>

      <P>The New York-based overseas preparatory

obtain early release of mainland Chinese dissident Wang Bingzhang.</P>
      <P>Fu Shenqi, spokesman for the dissident group, said Wang was

a dissident living there, was also arrested at the same time.</P>
      <P>Wang reportedly sneaked into the Chinese mainland from
Macau about two weeks ago for the formation of an opposition party in
mainland China. He founded the U.S.-based Chinese Alliance for

      <P>The statement said that mainland Chinese dissidents have
legitimate rights to go back to the China mainland, and that Wang
went back to the mainland in an "unusual way," because Beijing has
deprived dissidents of such rights. It urged Beijing to release Wang
Bingzhang and Wang Tingjin immediately.</P>
      <P>Beijing should hold dialogues with dissidents at home and abroad

(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The number of people going bankrupt in
Singapore rose 30 percent last year, hitting a new peak, and is
expected to rise even further this year.</P>
      <P>A total of 1,694 people were declared bankrupt last year, almost
10 percent more than the last peak in 1987, when recession had bitten
into Singapore, said a spokesman for the Official Assignee which
handles all bankruptcy cases in Singapore.</P>
      <P>"We expect the number to rise in 1998," he added.</P>
      <P>Lawyers who handle such cases confirmed the trend, adding that
there had also been a significant rise in people defaulting on their
loans since last October, The Straits Times reported on Sunday.</P>
      <P>However, some lawyers said that the comparison with the figure of
10 years ago should be seen in perspective.</P>
      <P>"Today, our total number of businesses is much larger than 10
years ago, and many bankruptcies are due to business failures of sole
proprietorships and small partnerships," a lawyer was quoted as
saying.</P>
      <P>The number might also have been swelled by the 1995 Bankruptcy
Act, which could have led to a bunching of cases last year as lawyers
adjusted to the changes.</P>
      <P>The new Act, replacing the harsher Bankruptcy Act of 1888, was
"more forgiving" to the debtor, he said.</P>
      <P>It raised the level of debt at which people could be declared
bankrupt to S$2,000, up from S$500 under the old law.</P>
      <P>Most bankrupts failed to pay their loans to banks and other
financial institutions, he said, adding than in recent months, people
were not only not paying their banks but were also failing to pay
their trade creditors.</P>
      <P>"There is a major cash-flow problem, especially if you are doing
business regionally," he was quoted as saying.</P>

      <P>Chou Yu-kuo, the media celebrity who was
allegedly forced to have an abortion by her lover, former chief
spokesman for Taiwan's provincial government Huang Yi-chiao, on
Sunday was reported to have been deeply frightened by a break-in at
her Taipei residence.</P>
      <P>According to local police, Chou's apartment in downtown Taipei
was found to have been entered by force on Saturday night. Chou was
not in at the time.</P>
      <P>Police rushed to the scene after being alerted by the apartment
building's security system. Following a preliminary investigation,
they found that the intruder had entered the apartment by breaking
into a closed-off porch area at the back of the house, the police
said.</P>
      <P>Chou was soon informed of the break-in, said a police spokesman,
who added that although the apartment had been ransacked, it appeared
that nothing had been stolen. The spokesman said it was likely that
the intruder fled when he heard the alarm go off.</P>
      <P>However, he added that the police were not ruling out the
possibility that the break-in might have been an act of revenge for
Chou's use of her radio talk show to publicize the sleazy details of
her alleged affair with Huang, who was demoted by his boss, Taiwan
Provincial Governor James Soong, as a result of the scandal.</P>
      <P>The journalist, author and broadcaster has recently been in the
media spotlight since accusing Huang of carrying on simultaneous
affairs with her and socialite Emmy Ho.</P>
      <P>The sensational nature of the allegations have sparked discussion
islandwide on the morals and behavior of civil servants who are often
in the political limelight, especially since Soong has a reputation
of having strong moral fiber and Huang was his right-hand man.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SPY  SATELLITE  FOR SALE TO ANYONE WITH US$200M</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  Feb.  8  (CNA)
(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Some Southeast Asian nations have been
offered the chance to purchase their own spy satellite and collect
information on a permanent basis -- if they can cough up US$200
million.</P>
      <P>At the moment, only a few developed countries have access to the
technology to build, launch and control their own military spy
satellites, The Straits Times reported Sunday in a dispatch from
Cannes, France.</P>
      <P>Others can purchase time on commercially-available satellites or
commission space-imaging companies to take surveillance or
reconnaissance photographs, it said.</P>
      <P>Another option is to purchase commercially-available photographs,
which are widely available in the market following the relaxation of
regulations on the use of American spy satellites by the US
government.</P>
      <P>However, these have restrictions on their areas of coverage,
especially in situations when the security of the country providing
the service is compromised.</P>
      <P>Not any more, the report said.</P>
      <P>France's Aerospatiale Space and Defense Branch, Europe's leading
exporter of satellites, is putting its Isys mini-satellite space
observation system up for sale on the open market, it said.</P>
      <P>For US$200 million, the buyer receives, on a turnkey basis, the
launch -- with insurance -- of a satellite into orbit, a spare
satellite, a ground control station, a mission center and one or more
image-processing stations which are compatible with existing
commercial satellites such as Spot, Landsat and Radarsat, the report
said.</P>
      <P>Associated services like training and image interpretation are
also provided.</P>
      <P>What is attractive about the Aerospatiale deal is that there are
no legal constraints of overflight.</P>
      <P>Said a spokesman for the Satellites Division, located on the
French Riviera: "We have done marketing presentations in Southeast
Asia and there is strong interest in such a system."</P>
      <P>The Isys satellite, a small platform, can take photographs from a
height of 1,500 km. It is highly accurate, with an accuracy of up to
3.5 meters. For accuracy as little as 2 meters, a bilateral agreement
with the French government is required, the report said.</P>
      <P>The early-warning satellite, with a lifespan of seven to eight
years, has a footprint of 1,000 km in radius extendible to 2,000 km.
It will cross over the area of coverage three times daily.</P>
      <P>"Isys is a good complement to tactical reconnaissance," said the
spokesman.</P>
      <P>Asia has tremendous potential for the commercial satellite
industry, particularly in communication satellites. Outside of the
US, the region represents close to half the worldwide satellite
market of US$40 billion.</P>
      <P>Of the six satellites launched by Aerospatiale last year, two are
owned by Asian countries -- Thaicom 3 for Thailand's Shinawatra
company and Sinosat-1 for mainland China, the report said.</P>
      <P>It quoted Joel Le Breton, senior vice president (commercial),
Satellite Operations, as commenting: "I believe that technological
development in Asia is so fast that there are new demands for
satellites. Basic telecommunication needs in Asia will remain very
strong."</P>

    <HEADLINE>WORST  OF REGIONAL CURRENCY CRISIS NOT OVER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore, Feb. 8 (CNA)
(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The worst of the regional currency crisis
will not be over until after the election of the Indonesian president
and vice president early next month, Singapore Senior Minister Lee
Kuan Yew said on Saturday night.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a Chinese New Year and Hari Raya dinner at his
constituency, Lee pointed out that the Indonesian rupiah will weaken
again if the market is uncomfortable with the choice of the next
Indonesian vice president.</P>
      <P>This would lead to higher inflation, more companies going
bankrupt, and greater unemployment, he said. "The resulting social
problems will be widespread," he added.</P>
      <P>"It is vital to Indonesia that the rupiah is stabilized and the
stock market begins to recover. Otherwise, the fallout will be bad
for Indonesia and may again spread panic over the region," he
commented.</P>
      <P>The crisis, he said, is beyond the control of Singapore, but it
should do whatever it can to help. This is why Prime Minister Goh
Chok Tong has called on President Suharto three times over the last
few weeks.</P>
      <P>Giving his audience of grassroots leaders and residents an
overview of the crisis, Lee said that unlike Thailand and South
Korea, investors have not been able to find a renewed sense of
confidence in Indonesia.</P>
      <P>During his hour-long speech in English and Mandarin, Lee also
analyzed the causes of the regional crisis, saying that investor
confidence evaporated when the ballooning current account deficits of
countries like Thailand, Indonesia and South Korea, which had
borrowed heavily in US dollars, were noticed.</P>
      <P>Their overspending, he noted, was made possible because of weak
banking systems, and exacerbated by corruption and cronyism.</P>
      <P>But the root of the problem was political, as governments were
more preoccupied with political difficulties and did not heed the
warning signals from the market, he said.</P>
      <P>"The Thais had six governments in five years and none had the
time to attend to the gaping current account deficit. The Malaysian
prime minister shifted the blame to foreign speculators, while
Suharto thought that he could ride out this crisis as he had ridden
so many others in the past 30 years," he said.</P>
      <P>"It is a crisis of confidence, and confidence has not yet been
restored... Where the market is not convinced that the leader is
doing what is necessary, they have withheld their votes of
confidence, leaving the currency vulnerable," he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CEPD RELEASES DRAFT ON OFFSHORE CASINO INDUSTRY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  9  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government has completed a draft on
development of Taiwan's offshore islands, paving the way for the
establishment of legal casinos in those areas, sources from the
Cabinet-level Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD)
reported Monday.</P>
      <P>The CEPD made public the development plan on Monday after coming
under pressure from the Legislative Yuan, which has pushed for the
legalization of casinos in offshore areas. Residents of the offshore
islands had also lobbied for the establishment of such business to
help generate income in the relatively backward areas.</P>
      <P>The draft, which may lead to the birth of legalized casinos in
the Taiwan area after years of debate in the Legislature and the
private sector, considers the casino business a legitimate industry,
rather than an umbrella for gambling operations.</P>
      <P>The CEPD plan suggested that an "offshore development fund" be
established before any casinos open for business.</P>
      <P>As residents in the offshore islands, including Penghu, Kinmen
and Green Island, have long complained of primitive and neglected
economic conditions in their hometowns, the council decided to give
them the "beef," CEPD officials said.</P>
      <P>That includes establishment of the development fund, to be
co-financed by the central and local governments, which will enable
infrastructural projects in the offshore areas to kick off with less
difficulty.</P>
      <P>The draft also proposed that the offshore development plan be
included in the central government's annual budget screening list,
entitling it to regular governmental funding.</P>
      <P>In addition, the draft proposed that the government liberalize
land use restrictions in the offshore areas to speed up development.
Economic and cultural development in the islands should also be
enhanced simultaneously so as to increase the appeal of those areas,
the draft indicated.</P>
      <P>The draft, however, left many key questions undecided, including
whether Kinmen, the frontline outpost near mainland China's Fujian
Province, Penghu, an archipelago in the Taiwan Strait, or Green
Island, an islet lying in the Pacific Ocean off Taiwan's southeast
coast, should be the first or perhaps the only location for
development of the casino industry.</P>
      <P>The draft also did not indicate whether the entire territory or
only designated areas of the island or islands chosen for casino
development should be zoned for the money-making enterprises.</P>
      <P>The question of which government agency should be in charge of
the casinos is yet another issue to be addressed. According to CEPD
officials, the Tourism Bureau does not support the idea of making
casinos a part of the tourism industry. And the bureau is reportedly
reluctant to assume responsibility for supervising the risky
business.</P>
      <P>The CEPD, meanwhile, believes the Interior Ministry should be the
responsible agency for the casinos, since the operations involve land
use and public order issues.</P>
      <P>Interior Minister Huang Chu-wen, who took office only a week ago,
said on Monday that he personally opposes the offshore island casino
proposal.</P>
      <P>Huang said the establishment of casinos in offshore areas goes
counter to the principles of the Ministry of Interior, which is
authorized to maintain the country's public order. He claimed that
the casino industry is a collective name for money laundering,
gangland fighting, organized crime and smuggling.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>John Chang, visiting secretary-general of
the Republic of China's ruling Kuomintang (KMT), on Sunday urged
overseas Chinese to rally behind the government in working for the
future development of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Speaking to members of the overseas Chinese community in New
York, Chang said the ROC, under the leadership of President Lee
Teng-hui, has steadily moved forward in the face of adversity and
tremendous pressure from mainland China.</P>
      <P>He expressed hope for continued support from overseas Chinese and
asked them to exert their influence in compelling mainland China to
handle cross-strait relations in a more pragmatic manner.</P>
      <P>He said that cross-strait issues require wisdom form both sides
of the Taiwan Strait, adding that mainland China should not impose
the Hong Kong formula or any other political model upon Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Instead, he urged the resumption of the disrupted cross-strait
dialogue on a rational basis in order to foster mutual trust in
anticipation of further negotiation and cooperation.</P>
      <P>He also stressed that President Lee's "no haste, be patient"
policy does not seek to disrupt trade exchanges between the two
sides. Rather, he said, it attempts to regulate Taiwan investments in
large-scale and infrastructural projects on the mainland in order to
protect the stability and security of the island.</P>
      <P>Chang, who led a delegation to attend a national prayer breakfast
at the White House Tuesday, concluded his trip to the United States
to return home Sunday afternoon.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  9 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Lee Teng-hui is planning to make
state visits to four of the Republic of China's allies in western
Africa this spring, sources from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
(MOFA) said on Monday.</P>
      <P>Based on considerations of climate and flight security, the
sources disclosed, President Lee is likely to visit Senegal and three
other ROC allies in western Africa between late March and early April
on a tour lasting no longer than two weeks.</P>
      <P>Foreign Minister Jason Hu, who returned from Africa last week,
however, declined to confirm the precise itinerary of Lee's proposed
African tour. He said details of the trip would be worked out after
his Feb. 14-22 visit to Africa, the third of its kind in recent
months.</P>
      <P>Citing the government's new diplomatic action plan under which
"everybody mobilizes to go abroad," Hu said overseas visits by
ranking officials, including the president, vice president and
premier, are clearly beneficial to bolstering ties with the ROC's
allies.</P>
      <P>The number of nations maintaining relations with the ROC was
recently reduced to 28 after South Africa and the Central African

    <HEADLINE>MOST SINGAPOREANS CAN SURVIVE THREE MONTHS WITHOUT WORK</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore, Feb. 9 (CNA)
(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Three months -- this is all the time that
most Singaporeans can afford to go without work.</P>
      <P>An international survey found that 62 percent of working
Singaporeans polled have enough savings to tide them over for less
than three months without work, The Straits Times reported Monday.</P>
      <P>Another 20 percent believe that they can remain unemployed for
three to six months.</P>
      <P>The poll, conducted by Gallup International and Joshua Research
Consultants, also found that only 6 percent of Singaporeans could get
by without employment for more than two years. The rest said they
could do without their jobs for seven months to two years.</P>
      <P>Over four in 10 expected unemployment to rise this year, while 29
percent thought that the number of workers without jobs would remain
the same. The rest thought it would fall.</P>
      <P>Three-quarters thought their present jobs were safe, while 18
percent feared that they might be out of work this year. Among the 18
percent who thought that there might be chances of unemployment, the
most pessimistic were those in their 50s or those who worked in
blue-collar jobs and had little formal education.</P>
      <P>Significantly, the report said, it was the blue-collar workers
and the less-educated who were the ones least able to miss work for
more than three months.</P>
      <P>As for personal savings, nearly three-quarters said they were
able to save, besides contributing to the Central Provident Fund.
Those who could not save were mainly blue-collar workers.</P>
      <P>Singaporeans also appear to be satisfied workers, with 82 percent
expressing happiness with their jobs, according to the survey.</P>
      <P>Even if they were not, they were generally cautious about making
their next move -- half of them said they would secure a new job
before leaving the present one.</P>
      <P>As for loyalty, three in five believe in being loyal to the firm
and would stay with it for at least five years. Not surprisingly,
those holding a different opinion were mainly the younger generation,
or employees in sales and service-related jobs.</P>
      <P>The findings were among those in the survey which showed that
Singaporeans were expecting hard times ahead, with 35 percent saying
this year would be worse than the last, and 43 percent expecting
economic difficulties in the months ahead, the report said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRICE PROTEST ENDS IN VANDALISM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Jakarta,  Feb.  9  (CNA)
(By Wu Pin-chiang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A protest against the rising prices of
basic commodities was held in Ende on Sunday, but ended in vandalism,
Regent Frans Gedowolo said.</P>
      <P>The incident, which is the latest in a spate of food riots that
have taken place in several Indonesian cities over the past few
weeks, resulted in damage to at least 16 shops, two cars and two
motorcycles. Some of the properties were set on fire, while others
were pelted with stones.</P>
      <P>"The disturbance was purely because of the rising prices of basic
commodities," the Jakarta Post quoted Gedowolo as saying Sunday
night.</P>
      <P>Gedowolo denied rumors that one man was stoned to death during
the disturbance. "It was just a coincidence. A man, a local, not a
Chinese, died near where the disturbance broke out," he said.</P>
      <P>He gave no other details.</P>
      <P>Resident sources said the disturbance broke out at about midday.
The demonstration involved about 200 people and started on Saturday.
There was not yet any information as to why it turned violent.</P>
      <P>No arrests were reported. Local police and military authorities
could not be reached for comment.</P>
      <P>"The police chief is out in the field monitoring the situation,"
a police officer at the Ende police precinct said when contacted from
Jakarta on Sunday night.</P>
      <P>The disturbance in Ende happened a day after similar unrest broke
out Saturday in the Bima regency in the neighboring West Nusa
Tenggara province.</P>
      <P>Three shops were set ablaze and seven others damaged during
unrest following a demonstration against price hikes that turned
violent.</P>
      <P>"It's returned to normal here now," an on-duty military officer
told the Post Sunday night, adding, however, that shops remained
closed.</P>
      <P>He said "hundreds" of soldiers and police were still "on red
alert," guarding the town against more unrest.</P>

    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Feb.  9  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia is set to support a US-led
military strike against Iraq in response to an appeal by President
Bill Clinton as it did during the Gulf War against Saddam Hussein in
1991, government sources said Monday.</P>
      <P>They said Clinton has made a request to Prime Minister John
Howard for support if and when the United States decides to strike
against Baghdad.</P>
      <P>Howard said he and Clinton agreed in their telephone conversation
last Saturday that the "first priority" was to find a diplomatic
solution to the building crisis over the enforcement of United
Nations efforts to locate and destroy weapons of mass destruction
inside Iraq.</P>
      <P>The Australian federal cabinet will hold a meeting Tuesday to
finalize its decision on how to support Washington. The options of
support include the use of air and maritime forces.</P>
      <P>The cabinet is expected to declare that Australia fully commits
itself to support any United States attack and to state that Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein cannot be allowed to retain and possibly use
chemical or biological weapons.</P>
      <P>"The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction is an important
national security issue, not only for Australia, but also for other
nations," Howard told reporters in Sydney on Sunday.</P>
      <P>During the 1991 Gulf War, Australia sent two warships to the
Middle East in support of the US-led war against Iraq in addition to
allowing Washington to use its military facilities.</P>
      <P>Among the capabilities certain to have been canvassed by
Australian military planners are the use of the Royal Australian Air
Force's F-111 aircraft and the deployment of ships to the Gulf in
support of the US carrier group already stationed there.</P>
      <P>The joint Australia-US intelligence and communications facilities
at Pine Gap and Nurrungar in central Australia are expected to play a
significant role in any renewed conflict between the United States
and Iraq as in 1991.</P>
      <P>Members of the Australian National Security Committee were
briefed on Friday by Defense Force Chief Gen. John Baker and Hugh
White, deputy secretary for strategy and intelligence of the Defense
Department.</P>
      <P>Ministers and defense officials here are meeting Monday to
discuss preparations of military units for the possibility of rapid
deployment to the Gulf, sources said.</P>
      <P>Australian Defense Minister Ian McLachlan on Sunday night said
Australia was considering both military and nonmilitary options for
supporting the United States.</P>
      <P>So far, Washington has received support from Britain and Germany
in its plans to strike against Iraq. But France, mainland China and
Russia have opposed a military strike.</P>
      <P>Australia's opposition leader Kim Beazley said, "I think it is
very important that there is bipartisan support ... the resolution of
the weapons of mass destruction issue is critical."</P>
      <P>Senior Australian officials told reporters that they expect the
threatened US attack could take place within a week to 14 days if
last-minute diplomatic initiatives fail.</P>
      <P>They expect a fierce and sustained air attack lasting several
days but no commitment of ground forces.</P>

    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Feb. 9 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Beijing has accused the Republic of China
on Taiwan of exploiting Asia's financial crisis to win diplomatic
prestige through high-level exchanges with regional governments that
are seeking financial aid to restore their own economic stability.</P>
      <P>In a dispatch from Beijing on Monday, mass circulation newspaper
The Sydney Morning Herald reported that most regional governments
usually avoid high-level contact with Taiwan to placate mainland
China. But the financial crisis has emboldened top officials from
Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Singapore to hold regular
talks with senior ROC counterparts.</P>
      <P>The daily reported Malaysia's Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim
is to visit Taipei and meet Premier Vincent Siew and other senior
officials this week during a two-day visit.</P>
      <P>Siew made surprise visits to the Philippines and Indonesia last
month where he was reported to have met top government leaders,
including Indonesian President Suharto.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Vice President Lien Chan also visited Singapore last
month, where he met Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong and Senior Minister
Lee Kuan Yew.</P>
      <P>Goh and Malaysia's Prime Minister Mahathir met Siew on their way
home from an APEC leaders meeting in Vancouver last November.</P>
      <P>The daily reported that mainland Chinese Foreign Ministry
spokesman Shen Guofang has accused Taipei of making diplomatic
capital from the Asian financial crisis.</P>
      <P>But Beijing has so far refrained from attacking Southeast Asian
governments for seeking advice and assistance from Taiwan as they
grapple with the economic meltdown.</P>
      <P>The daily quoted diplomatic analysts as saying that Beijing has
little choice but to accept Taiwan's enhanced stature and its offers
of help while the regional economic instability poses a threat to the
Chinese mainland economy.
 They also believe Taipei has so far delivered little tangible help
to regional governments in Southeast Asia.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The parents of longtime dissident Wang
Bingzhang on Monday wrote to mainland China's President Jiang Zemin,
urging the Beijing authorities not to harm their son.</P>
      <P>It was reported that the fugitive dissident was arrested last
Friday in the city of Bengbu, Anhui Province, by local security
police.</P>
      <P>Lu Siqing, who runs a dissident monitoring group in Hong Kong,
told a CNA correspondent that Wang's parents, currently residing in
Canada, wrote to Jiang on Monday morning (Hong Kong time), calling
for Beijing not to injure their son.</P>
      <P>"We are about eighty years of age now. We wish that our son is
safe and well, and that we can have a happy family reunion," Wang's
parents, Wang Chunshun and Wang Gueifang, said in the letter.</P>
      <P>They don't have any knowledge about the reasons for their son's
arrest, said Lu, adding that it is not necessary for the Beijing
authorities to provide an excuse for detaining a dissident.</P>
      <P>Wang Youtsai and Cheng Fan, two dissidents now living in the
Chinese mainland, also made a statement early Monday through the Hong
Kong-based monitoring group, calling on Beijing to release Wang
immediately and to allow exiled mainland dissidents to return to
their own country.</P>
      <P>Wang Youtsai, one of the 21 student leaders of the 1989 Tiananmen
pro-democracy demonstrations, was sentenced to four years in prison
for his role in the protests. He is currently working in the city of

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING CONTAINMENT PRESSURE 'UNIMAGINABLY FORMIDABLE' SAYS HU</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  9  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Beijing's attempts to repress Taiwan's
activities in the international community have created a degree of
pressure that is beyond imagination, Foreign Affairs Minister Jason
Hu said Monday.</P>
      <P>Citing Africa as an example, Hu, who returned last week from his
second visit in four months to that continent, said Beijing has
considerably stepped up its activities there, including the recent
establishment of 10 commercial promotion centers, in an apparent
attempt to lure away the Republic of China's diplomatic allies.</P>
      <P>Under Beijing's containment pressure, which is strategically
fueled by a new economic foray, including the creation of the trade
promotion centers and the formation of an African economic guidance
task force, Taipei's diplomatic policy toward Africa is now at a
critical juncture, Hu pointed out.</P>
      <P>To ensure sufficient room for the ROC's national survival and
sustainable development, Taipei will not consider suspending or
cutting back its promotion of pragmatic diplomacy, Hu said, adding
that consolidating friendship with allies will remain the
government's "top task."</P>
      <P>Hu said he does not believe that mainland China's disposition
toward Taiwan will improve even if Taipei should agree to abandon its
pragmatic diplomacy in a bid to appease Beijing.</P>
      <P>The ROC foreign minister told Beijing authorities to abandon any
notion that they can press Taiwan back to the negotiating table
simply by stamping out international recognition of the ROC.</P>
      <P>Beijing's effort to contain and isolate Taiwan in the
international community will only backfire and can make no
contribution to positive interaction across the Taiwan Strait, Hu
stressed.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Hu expressed hope that the ROC diplomatic corps in
Africa will be staffed by more personnel with economic or financial
backgrounds so as to upgrade the nation's embassies from "windows of
friendship" to "windows of development." The ROC currently has
embassies in nine of the 54 African nations.</P>
      <P>Hu is scheduled to visit Africa again on Feb. 14-22 for his third
trip there in four months, to further consolidate ties with allied
nations and to clear the way for President Lee Teng-hui's planned
trip to western Africa between late March and early April.</P>

      <P>An official of the Republic of China
said here Saturday that communism has been failing in various parts
of the world, and that only after communism is abandoned by Beijing
can cross-strait talks on national unification begin.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a symposium on the political situation on
Taiwan, Stephen S. F. Chen, representative of the Taipei Economic and
Cultural Representative Office in the United States, said it would
be illogical for Beijing to continue to cling to communism.</P>
      <P>He said it would greatly disappoint the Chinese people in
mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macao if Taiwan agreed to unite with
mainland China under communist rule.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has been a beacon of hope to those Chinese people because
of its success in democratization. If the "beacon effect"
disappeared, Beijing would easily reneg1 on its promise to the
people in Hong Kong and Macao, he added.</P>
      <P>Nataleh Bellocchi, former board chairman and managing director
of the American Institute in Taiwan, said at the symposium sponsored
by Friends of President Lee Teng-hui in Washington that Taiwan's
achievement in democratization is the real foundation of American
support. Taiwan's success in democratization is instrumental in the
improvement of relations between the two countries, he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MND DECLINES COMMENT ON US SALE OF AIR TRAINING EQUIPMENT TO BEIJING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  8  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of National Defense (MND) of
the Republic of China on Sunday declined to comment on a newspaper
report that a planned US sale of air force equipment to Beijing will
alter the balance of air power over the Taiwan Strait, saying only
that it is aware of the news and will continue to monitor mainland
Chinese troop movements on the other side of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The United Daily News, citing sources within the ROC Air Force,
reported recently that the US is proceeding with the sale of the
advanced air combat mock instrument (ACMI) system to Beijing, which
the newspaper predicted will enhance the combat capability of
mainland China's pilots.</P>
      <P>The ACMI uses a remote computer system to process data received
during battle training simulations and is far more advanced than any
training device previously used by mainland China.</P>
      <P>However, an ROC Air Force officer said it remains to be seen
whether Washington's ACMI sale will help boost the capabilities of
the mainland's air force, as the bulk of its current air fleet,
Su-27s and Su-31s, are all Russian-made.</P>
      <P>Relevant sources indicated that the mainland also uses locally
made airplanes modeled after the Kfir fighter planes jointly
developed by Israel and the US in the engine, control and operating
systems, and pointed out that the planned ACMI sale will largely
upgrade the training capabilities of the mainland's air force once
its home-built airplanes begin mass production and become the
backbone of its future air fleet.</P>
      <P>According to the sources, such a scenario will indeed have a
negative effect on Taiwan's air superiority over the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>An official with the MND expressed confidence that the ROC Air
Force will continue to maintain its superiority over the strait with
the deployment of its second-generation indigenous defense fighters
and its 60 French-made Mirage 2000-5s and 150 US-made F-16s. He added
that the air force is also seeking to strengthen the training and
combat skills of its pilots and further develop the capabilities of
its combat planes.</P>
      <P>Although the mainland air force has also acquired high-end combat
airplanes and has the advantage in terms of numbers, the official
said, the quality of Taiwan's pilots far surpasses those of mainland
China.</P>
      <P>But he admitted that the ACMI sale is still worth noting and
added that the MND is closely watching subsequent developments.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Hau Pei-tsun, who formerly served as ROC national
defense minister and chief of the general staff of the ROC Army, said
that the ACMI sale will undoubtedly have a negative impact on Taiwan,
but that cross-strait disputes should be addressed through political
rather than military means.</P>
      <P>The major purpose of recent visits by mainland China's military
chief Chi Haotian to several foreign countries is aimed at blocking
Taiwan in the international community, Hau pointed out, adding that
Taiwan and the mainland should reopen negotiations as soon as
possible to replace military confrontation as a way of mending their
differences.</P>

    <HEADLINE>REPORTS OF MOEA CHIEF'S VISIT TO SOUTH KOREA DENIED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A high-ranking economic official denied on
Monday that Republic of China Minister of Economic Affairs Wang
Chih-kang will lead a delegation on a visit to South Korea.</P>
      <P>Yiin Chii-ming, vice economic affairs minister, said the Ministry
of Economic Affairs (MOEA) has "no plans" for such a visit.</P>
      <P>Yiin was responding to a local news report which said the MOEA is
planning to lead a delegation to Seoul to reopen long-stalled trade
talks with South Korea.</P>
      <P>The report in the China Times said that if Wang's trip goes
ahead, it will be the first ministerial-level exchange between Seoul
and Taipei since the two countries severed ties after South Korea
switched diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing in August
1992.</P>
      <P>The report also said that the delegation was hoping to wait until
the inauguration of President-elect Kim Dae Jung and the swearing in
of the new South Korean Cabinet in March before making the trip,
adding that the most likely time for the visit will be late April or
early May.</P>
      <P>Yiin denied the reports, saying that there is "no such plan or
idea at the present stage."</P>
      <P>He added that the resumption of high-level exchanges "will
involve a lot of issues," but would not elaborate on what these
issues were.</P>
      <P>South Korea sent a delegation to Taiwan in mid-January which
communicated with Taipei on the technical aspects of issues such as
the resumption of air links and reciprocal barter trade in fruit.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ECONOMISTS NOT IN FAVOR OF USING S$ AS ASEAN PEG</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore, Feb. 9 (CNA)
(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>While economists say the Singapore dollar
has all the attributes of an international currency, they have given
the thumbs down to a Malaysian proposal to use it as peg for trade
among ASEAN countries.</P>
      <P>There would be spin-offs for the further development of Singapore
as a financial center, but it is not feasible, as the economy is
neither large nor strong enough, said economists polled by The
Straits Times.</P>
      <P>The economists said the Japanese yen would be a better
alternative as a peg to reduce the volatility of ASEAN currencies,
the report said.</P>
      <P>Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad suggested last Friday
that ASEAN should consider using the Singapore dollar as a common
trading currency. This followed earlier suggestions by him that ASEAN
currencies be used for intraregional trade to offset regional
dependencies on the US dollar.</P>
      <P>All the economists polled agreed that the Singapore dollar has
strength, stability and familiarity, the report said.</P>
      <P>But "if the Singapore dollar is to be used as a regional trading
currency, then its strength will not only depend on the strength of
the Singapore economy, but also on the strengths of the regional
economies," Goh Mou Lih, a strategist at the Daiwa Institute of
Research, was quoted as saying.</P>
      <P>Another economist said that it may not be appropriate unless
Singapore's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is larger than the rest of
ASEAN. "This is necessary to provide a buffer against regional
developments," he added.</P>
      <P>According to the World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness
Report 1997, Singapore's GDP was US$93 billion in 1996 -- behind
those of Indonesia, Thailand and Malaysia.</P>
      <P>On a proposal that ASEAN countries should trade using their
respective currencies, one economist said a better solution would be
for ASEAN currencies to be pegged to "a basket of currencies with
heavier yen weighting."</P>
      <P>Other economists said that in view of the Japanese government's
intention to promote the internationalization of the yen, this might
be a more feasible solution, the report said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The world has a quarter of a billion child
workers and their numbers are set to rise, the Geneva-based
International Labor Office (ILO) said Monday.</P>
      <P>The problem is particularly severe in Africa, where the ILO says
the number of child laborers could increase by a quarter to 100
million by 2015. The ILO report revealed that previous research based
on household surveys underestimated the number of child workers.</P>
      <P>At least 120 million young people worldwide aged between five and
14 work full-time, the report said, also noting that another 130
million children do significant amounts of work in addition to going
to school.</P>
      <P>The ILO estimates that 41.4 percent of African children aged
between five and 14 are economically active, compared with 21.1
percent in Asia, 16.5 percent in Latin America and the Caribbean and
10.4 percent in the Pacific region.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIPEI AMCHAM URGES EARLY CONCLUSION OF ROC-US WTO TALKS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 9 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The American Chamber of Commerce (AmCham) in
Taipei has called for the bilateral negotiations between the Republic
of China and the United States on Taiwan's accession to the World
Trade Organization (WTO) to be completed soon.</P>
      <P>In a letter to US Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky that
was released at a press conference here Monday, Taipei AmCham
President Jeffrey Williams asserted, "We believe that now could be an
ideal time to close the bilateral phase of the ROC's WTO
negotiations."</P>
      <P>Williams praised Taiwan's dramatic improvements in opening market
access to foreigners in many industries and many other positive
changes in the island's investment climate.</P>
      <P>The completion of Taipei's bilateral talks with Washington about
Taiwan's entry into the WTO, the latest round of which is scheduled
to open in Washington on Monday, would bring the ROC one step closer
to gaining full entry into the world trade body.</P>
      <P>Reports that the authorities would agree to open Taiwan's markets
to US pork while shutting out US rice or poultry have outraged local
pig farmers, who have threatened to launch a protest rally of 10,000
people in front of the presidential office on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Trade and agricultural officials denied the reports. Vice
Economics Minister Yiin Chii-ming and Animal Industry Director under
the Council of Agriculture Chen Pao-chi said on separate occasions on
Monday that government negotiators will not protect any particular
industry at the expense of others.</P>
      <P>In response to reporters' questions, Williams said that
agriculture is a politically sensitive sector for both Taiwan and the
United States.</P>
      <P>Although the Taipei AmCham consists predominantly of businessmen
involved in banking and financial industries, Williams added his
organization's voice to the agricultural dispute by calling for the
matter to be solved through mutual concessions.</P>
      <P>In a veiled rejection of Beijing's demand that Taiwan be granted
entry to the WTO only after Beijing becomes a full member, Williams
said at the press conference that the WTO applications of Taiwan and
mainland China should be considered separately on their own merits
rather than have Taipei's accession linked to that of Beijing.</P>
      <P>"We hope that the remaining issues, including agricultural
issues, can be resolved in this round of negotiations so that both
Taiwan and US business can begin to enjoy the benefits of Taiwan's
WTO membership as soon as possible," he said.</P>

      <P>Former US Senate Republican leader Bob Dole
called on Finance Minister Paul C.H. Chiu here on Monday to exchange
views on the current Asian financial crisis.</P>
      <P>Dole, who retired from politics after losing his third
presidential bid in 1996, in January accepted an offer from the

a "foreign agent" for Taiwan.</P>

during his nearly forty years in the US Congress. This is his first

      <P>During the meeting, Dole expressed great interest in Taiwan's
escape from most of the financial storm that has attacked the region
and undermined the economic development of other Asian emerging
economies.</P>
      <P>Chiu told his visitor that Taiwan was able to pass through the
destructive financial assault relatively unscathed because of sound
monetary fundamentals, relevant governmental agencies' perfect
coordination in dealing with the regional crisis and the government's
policy to encourage the development of Taiwan's information industry.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Denying that the government will open Taiwan
to US pork in exchange for Washington dropping its push to pry open
the island's rice market, Premier Vincent Siew emphasized on Monday
that the government's policy is to protect all agricultural sectors
equally.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and the United States are scheduled to begin another round
of bilateral negotiations this week on Taiwan's accession to the
World Trade Organization (WTO). The import of US agricultural
products into Taiwan is expected to be an especially difficult issue
in the talks.</P>
      <P>It has been widely reported that the authorities here, in order
to win Washington's endorsement for Taiwan's WTO bid, are ready to
bow to US pressure and open the island's markets to US pork in
exchange for being able to continue excluding US rice or poultry.</P>
      <P>The reports have set off panic among local pig farmers, who are
still reeling from a foot-and-mouth disease epidemic early last year
that wrought havoc on the local pig population and wiped out the
island's US$1.5 billion pork exports industry.</P>
      <P>The pig farmers have called for a protest against the alleged
trade-off in front of the presidential office on Wednesday, saying
they would rally 10,000 people.</P>
      <P>Siew called the reports that the government will abandon the hog
ranchers "absolutely groundless," telling reporters Monday afternoon
that he has been briefed on the Taiwan negotiators' bottom line and
that no industry will be sacrificed in the bilateral negotiations.</P>
      <P>He refused to elaborate on what Taiwan would be willing to give
up in the negotiations, saying it would be inappropriate to discuss
this before the talks. He added, however, that the negotiating team
will seek to gain as much as possible for Taiwan's public.</P>
      <P>Lee Jen-chyuan, vice chairman of the cabinet-level Council of
Agriculture, said on a separate occasion Monday that the government
would never sacrifice any particular industry -- be it rice
production, pig farming or poultry -- for the sake of concluding the
WTO bilateral negotiations.</P>
      <P>Vowing he would risk the breakdown of the negotiations rather
than abandon local industries, Lee urged the farmers to swing behind
the government's line in the negotiations and to refrain from any
dramatic protest that might cause Washington to miscalculate Taipei's
intentions and thus to affect the forthcoming talks negatively.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a group of swine farmers met in Chiayi, central
Taiwan, on Monday and decided to go ahead with the protest in Taipei
despite government leaders' frantic efforts to head it off.</P>
      <P>Protest organizers have said more than 10,000 pig farmers from
around the island will rally in Taipei and march on the presidential
office, the headquarters of the ruling Kuomintang and the Ministry of
Economic Affairs.</P>
      <P>The protesters will demand that the government not give in to
Washington's pressure and will call for their industry to receive an
adjustment period of at least six years.</P>

importers in retaliation against Washington's pressure on Taipei to
lower import tariffs on chicken meat, pork and byproducts.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for the Taipei office of the US Feed Grain Council
said Callahan hopes to learn more about the local grain importers'
stance and their opinions about the issue.</P>
      <P>Callahan arrived in Taipei on Monday and is scheduled to leave
for home on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has been the third largest market for US grain. It
imported 6 million tons of US grain in 1997, worth more than US$650
million.</P>
      <P>Since Feb. 4, private Taiwan importers have boycotted US grain
in retaliation for Washington's pressure on Taipei to open its
chicken meat, pork, rice and animal intestines markets.</P>
      <P>Private Taiwan grain traders usually make 95 percent of their
purchases from the United States. But local press reports said local
grain buyers turned away from US grain last week to buy 214,000 tons
of soybeans and corn from Central and South American countries and
are expected to tender for a further 54,000 tons of Latin American
grain this week.</P>
      <P>Local grain buyers are concerned that Taiwan's husbandry
industry, still recovering from an islandwide outbreak of
foot-and-mouth disease that forced the slaughter of 4 million hogs
last year, will be hurt if Taiwan opens it market to cheaper US meat
products.</P>
      <P>Alarmed over reports that Taiwan may cut a deal with the United
States in the ongoing round of talks in Washington, D.C., on terms
for the island to join the World Trade Organization (WTO), local feed
and meat industry operators reportedly have planned a mass protest
outside the Presidential Office in downtown Taipei on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Government negotiators have denied unsubstantiated media reports
that Taiwan was prepared to make "major concessions" to the United
States on farm trade issues, including market opening and tariff
cuts, during the current round of WTO talks.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, reports from Washington said American feed grain
and pork industry associations have exerted strong pressure on the US
government to push Taiwan to lift its pork import ban and lower
tariff rates on various meat products.</P>
      <P>The reports further said that if the current working-level trade
consultations fail to achieve any breakthroughs, the Clinton
administration may not arrange a meeting between ROC Economics
Minister Wang Chih-kang and US Trade Representative Charlene
Barshefsky.</P>
      <P>According to the reports, Deputy US Trade Representative Richard
Fisher may replace Barshefsky to meet with Wang if the Feb. 9-14
Taiwan-US WTO negotiations fail to resolve some differences.</P>
      <P>Wang is scheduled to arrive in Washington next week to seek
policy breakthroughs concerning bilateral WTO-related talks.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and the United States have failed to resolve their
outstanding trade differences in the 16 previous rounds of WTO talks.
Wang said on Tuesday he hopes his Feb. 17-18 visit to Washington can
help finalize the bilateral consultations to facilitate Taiwan's
entry to the Geneva-based world trade regulatory body.</P>
      <P>Wang further said the ROC government will do its best to protect
interests of all local farmers in negotiating for Taiwan's WTO
accession. "We won't sacrifice the legitimate rights and interests of
any farming sector," he said, dismissing as "unfounded" the reports
that the government will protect interests of rice farmers at the
expense of hog ranchers.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ACCORD FOR JOINT US-PHILIPPINE MILITARY EXERCISES SIGNED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Manila,  Feb.  10  (CNA)
(By Timothy Sun)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Philippines and the United States on
Monday formally signed a visiting forces agreement (VFA) which would
pave the way for the resumption of the joint military exercises in
the country of Filipino and American troops.</P>
      <P>The accord is scheduled to be signed at 5:00 p.m. at the
Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) by Foreign Affairs Secretary
Domingo Siazon and US Ambassador to the Philippines Thomas Hubbard.</P>
      <P>Once it is signed, the DFA will have to submit the agreement to
the Senate for ratification.</P>
      <P>The agreement establishes the manner for disposing of criminal
cases against any member of the US forces as well as a procedure for
resolving differences that may arise between the two sides.</P>
      <P>The DFA maintains that the agreement pertains solely to the legal
treatment of US troops temporarily visiting to the Philippines and
that it does not offer access arrangements for the US armed forces or
allowing the stationing of US troops in the country.</P>
      <P>A VFA primer prepared by the DFA stated that the United States
has entered into similar agreements with more than 50 countries
during the last 20 years. Thus, the accord is not unique to the
Philippines.</P>
      <P>The primer added that it is a well-established international
practice that a country like the Philippines visited by friendly
foreign troops enters into arrangements with the sending country on
the legal treatment of its troops while in the host country.</P>
      <P>But despite these assurances, there are still some sectors,
especially anti-nuclear groups, which have been voicing strong
opposition to the agreement. They have expressed fear that it would
mean the return of US bases in the country.
 The joint military exercises have been put on hold due to lack of
clear guidelines since 1995.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ASIAN CRISIS HITS AUSSIE ECONOMY EARLIER THAN EXPECTED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Feb.  10  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Asian financial crisis is wreaking
havoc on the Australian economy much earlier than expected with the
country's job market weakening in January, according to a new survey
by the Australian New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ) on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The job advertisements plunged 6 percent in seasonally adjusted
terms in January, compared to a rise of 0.1 percent in December,
according to the survey.</P>
      <P>The survey suggests the Asian crisis is already biting into
Australia's economic performance, with worse to come.</P>
      <P>But Prime Minister John Howard dismissed the slump on the job
market, saying it was too early to draw such a conclusion.</P>
      <P>However, his view was not shared by ANZ chief economist Saul
Eslake, who warned that the falling figures might be an early
indication of the impact of the Asian crisis on employer-hiring
intentions.</P>
      <P>Banker Trust (BT) Australia, a leading economic forecaster, also
joined the ANZ and other market economists to predict that
Australia's average growth this year would drop by at least one
percentage point because Asian demand for Australian products would
drop.</P>
      <P>The ANZ survey shows that the number of jobs advertised in
January fell by 6 percent and that New South Wales was worst hit with
an 8.8 percent fall.</P>
      <P>The fall in retail sales in December and sagging foreign tourist
arrivals reflected the problems in Asia, one economist said.</P>
      <P>Job advertisements are served as a leading indicator of the
Australian economy and employment growth. Any fall in the number of
ads does not augur well for the Australian government's efforts to
cut jobless rate from its current 8.1 percent, economists said.</P>
      <P>"The sharp decline in the number of job advertisements ... would
be consistent with evidence already to hand of the effect of Asian
crisis on the tourist industry, which is particularly
labor-intensive," Eslake said.</P>
      <P>It was also consistent with "evidence from business surveys and
individual companies which suggests that firms trading with Asia have
begun to experience reductions in sales and orders," he added.</P>
      <P>"Asia will detract 1 percent from Australia's growth rate. This
will push growth to 4 percent in 1998 from 5 percent (of the
country's gross domestic product)," BT Australia's economist Rory
Robertson said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ASIAN FINANCIAL CRISIS SAID INFECTING MAINLAND CHINA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Feb.  10  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Asian financial crisis is now
infecting mainland China with warnings that its exports and foreign
investment will slump, which will pressure Beijing to devalue its
currency, thus deepening the regional turmoil.</P>
      <P>In a dispatch from Beijing, mass-circulation newspaper The Sydney
Morning Herald's correspondent David Lague reported that official
media and Chinese mainland leaders are acknowledging that stiff
competition from exporters with sharply lower currencies, including
Indonesia, Thailand and South Korea, threatens mainland China's trade
as regional demand for its goods drops.</P>
      <P>Foreign investment in the Chinese mainland is also expected to
fall sharply because traditional Asian investors have suffered huge
losses through the financial crisis and Western companies are worried
about the higher risks of doing business in the mainland, according
to the daily.</P>
      <P>If Beijing does devalue the yuan, this might force regional
economies into a new round of damaging devaluations and undermine the
Hong Kong dollar's peg to the US currency, which could trigger
further regional turmoil.</P>
      <P>Mainland China's trade minister Wu Yi admitted last weekend that
her country faced "stark challenges" in trade this year, mainly
because of the crisis.</P>
      <P>The daily also quoted the official China Daily as sounding an
unusually frank report warning that mainland China's exports and
foreign investment there were at risk.</P>
      <P>The daily reported that the Hong Kong-based Asian Hedge Fund
(AHF) made a similar warning. AHF director William Kaye said that
Beijing would come under enormous pressure to devalue the yuan.</P>
      <P>"It would in all likelihood be the catalyst for another round of
competitive devaluations throughout the region that could throw the
world into a 1930s-type scenario," Kaye said.</P>
      <P>Western diplomats in Beijing believe the mainland would suffer a
painful loss in prestige if it devalues the yuan in the short term
because Vice Premier Zhu Rongji and other senior officials have ruled
out the depreciation of their currency.</P>

      <P>Hu said that the 1996 Republican presidential nominee arrived in

    <TEXT>
      <P>In the face of Taiwan's long-expected entry
into the World Trade Organization, the state-run Taiwan Sugar
Corporation (Taisugar) is actively planning to explore new horizons
overseas, a spokesman for Taisugar said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Taisugar has worked out plans to relocate its hog and cattle
raising, orchid growing, and sugar production operations to countries
in Southeast Asia, the Americas and Australia, according to the
spokesman.</P>
      <P>In cooperation with Taiwan-based and Vietnamese food processors,
Taisugar is scheduled to build a sugar mill in northern Vietnam, with
an annual production of 90,000 tons, he said, adding that the
state-run unit will also set up a hog-raising farm on its own in Ho
Chi Minh City in southern Vietnam, annual output of which is set at
60,000 hogs.</P>
      <P>Another joint-venture stud-hog farm will be established in the
Philippines, and it will have an annual production of 6,000 stud pigs
and 22,000 hogs.</P>
      <P>He went on to say that Taisugar also has reached agreement to run
a cattle ranch with a branch of the Australia-based Elders Corp. in
that country, while it has purchased a 60 percent share of
Australia's Euphror Group, which sells 300,000 pigs and produces
150,000 metric tons of feed each year.</P>
      <P>In Canada, Taisugar has acquired a three-hectare lot in British
Colombia for the establishment of an orchid-growing facility, while

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  10 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government's policy toward investment
in mainland China is one of cautious moderation and is not intended
to put cross-strait trade exchanges back on track, Mainland Affairs
Council (MAC) Chairman Chang King-yu said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chang made the remarks when he reiterated the government's "no
haste, be patient" policy at a gathering of Taiwan businessmen with
investments on the mainland.</P>
      <P>He said that the policy has borne fruit, adding that although the
scale of the mainland investments has been scaled back after its
implementation, the number of such projects remains largely the same.</P>
      <P>Stating that the policy does not aim to backpedal in the handling
of cross-strait relations, Chang said the government has merely
implemented necessary restraints on hi-tech, infrastructural and
large-scale investment projects on the mainland that might affect
Taiwan's financial security.</P>
      <P>He said that the policy has not disrupted Taiwan's small and
medium-sized investments in the mainland.</P>
      <P>Kao Chin-yen, chairman of the Chinese National Federation of
Industries, speaking on the same occasion, urged Taiwan businessmen
to support the government's policy for the dignity of the nation.</P>
      <P>Kao also urged Taiwan businessmen to help push for the early
resumption of long-stalled cross-strait talks.</P>
      <P>A Taiwan businessman leader at the gathering said the "no haste,
be patient" policy is basically sound in principle. He pointed out
that Taiwan's hi-tech development, quality of personnel and capital
resources are superior to those of the mainland, and said that large
enterprises should keep their roots in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>But Tsai Yu-cheng, president of a Taiwan enterprise association
in Ningpo, Zhejiang province, urged the government to quicken the pace
of opening direct shipping links, saying that Taiwan businessmen
could save the time and money in transportation and increase their
profits.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Anwar
Ibrahim is scheduled to arrive in Taipei on Wednesday for a private
visit.</P>
      <P>Anwar, who concurrently serves as Malaysia's finance minister,
will meet with local industry and business executives Wednesday
afternoon to discuss Asia's current financial crisis.</P>
      <P>This will be Anwar's first visit to Taiwan, which does not
maintain formal diplomatic ties with Malaysia. His visit comes as
part of the Malaysian government's drive to seek joint means of
tackling regional financial woes.</P>
      <P>As part of such efforts, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad has already visited Singapore, the Philippines and Thailand,
while his deputy, Anwar, left Kuala Lumpur on Sunday for a three-day
visit to Japan.</P>
      <P>In Tokyo, Anwar met with senior Japanese government officials,
bankers, financial experts and business leaders to exchange views on
regional financial and economic issues.</P>
      <P>Anwar, an heir-apparent to Mahathir, will travel to Taipei after
winding up his Japan visit on Wednesday morning.</P>
      <P>Anwar told Malaysian media prior to his departure that his trip
is not aimed at asking neighboring countries to offer special
assistance to Malaysia, but rather at seeking joint efforts to
resolve regionwide financial problems.</P>
      <P>ROC Minister of Foreign Affairs Jason Hu would not reveal details
of Anwar's itinerary here. As the visit is of a private nature, Hu
said he must respect Anwar's personal wishes. "Without his consent,
we can't disclose his itinerary," he added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Legislative Yuan caucus of the opposition
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) on Tuesday urged Malaysia to sign
an investment guarantee agreement with Taiwan to protect the rights
and interests of Taiwan investors in the Southeast Asian country.</P>
      <P>According to Malaysian tallies, Taiwan entrepreneurs had
funneled more than US$8 billion into Malaysia for 1,501 investment
projects as of October 1997, making Taiwan Malaysia's second
largest source of foreign capital after Japan.</P>
      <P>DPP parliamentary whip Chang Chun-hsiung said Taiwan investors
face many major problems in Malaysia. For one thing, Malaysia still
bans foreign banks from setting up branches on its territory.
Secondly, the Malaysian government would not offer permanent
residency to Taiwan investors. Moreover, public order in regions
where Taiwan investors reside has continued to deteriorate.</P>
      <P>Chang said the DPP welcomes Anwar's visit to Taipei and will be
pleased to see Taiwan and Malaysia cooperate in resolving regionwide
financial issues. "Nevertheless, we hope the Malaysian government
will sincerely help Taiwan investors address their problems," Chang
said, adding that signing a bilateral investment guarantee pact will
make Anwar's Taipei visit more meaningful.</P>

      <P>Lee made the remarks in his keynote speech to the opening
ceremony for the Internet Commerce Expo '98 sponsored by the

the development of related products and services.</P>
      <P>Lee said Taiwan has emerged as the world's third largest
information-technology (IT) products manaufacturing country through
concerted efforts by the government and local entrepreneurs.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan has become one of the world's most important suppliers
of personal computers and peripherals," Lee said, adding that many
foreign professional magazines have advised their readers to buy
Taiwan-made hardware because prices for those products are highly
competitive and their quality is very good.</P>
      <P>Lee said Taiwan also plays a leading role in OEM (original

Nevertheelss, Lee said, Taiwan should step up research and

      <P>When asked whether the proposal was intended to suggest that the

    <HEADLINE>S'PORE'S GDP GROWTH FORECAST A MERE 0.8% THIS YEAR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore, Feb. 10 (CNA)
(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Lehman Brothers, a leading US investment
bank, on Monday forecast that Singapore will have economic growth of
a mere 0.8 percent this year as the region slides into a recession.</P>
      <P>Both Singapore and the Republic of China, "two countries with
strong underlying economic fundamentals but heavy trade
competitiveness exposure to the region" should be able to avoid a
recession -- "but only just," it said.</P>
      <P>A dramatic slowdown in domestic demand in the crisis-hit
countries of Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, the Philippines and South
Korea will result in their economies contracting this year, and this
will have a significant fallout on Singapore, the bank said.</P>
      <P>Lehman Brothers made the forecasts in its outlook for the global
economy for 1998 presented at a seminar in Singapore Monday.</P>
      <P>Collectively, it said, the Asian economies -- excluding Japan --
"seem likely to enjoy little, if any, growth" this year.</P>
      <P>"The rate of increase in (their collective) gross domestic
product (GDP) may well slow sharply, from around 6 percent in 1997 to
a mere 1/2 percent or so in 1998, before staging a limited recovery
to, say, 4 percent-odd in 1999," it added.</P>
      <P>The bank is predicting that Singapore could rebound quickly and
chalk up 6.5 percent growth next year, after the worst of the crisis
has blown over.</P>
      <P>This year's outlook differs importantly between Asian countries,
it pointed out.</P>
      <P>The worst performers are expected to be South Korea, Indonesia
and Thailand, where severe recessions are likely, it said.</P>
      <P>Less-severe recessions are forecast for Malaysia and the
Philippines.</P>
      <P>Although Hong Kong might manage to expand, "if the exchange rate
peg were to go -- which at present we do not expect -- an outright
recession would most likely follow," the bank said.</P>
      <P>Significantly, the Asian crisis could also cut US GDP growth by
nearly half to around 2 percent, said Lehman Brothers' global chief
economist, Dr. John Llewellyn, at the seminar.</P>
      <P>Cheaper imports from the Asian countries that experienced
depreciations of their currencies will widen the US trade gap this
year, added Lehman Brothers' chief economist for North America,
Stephen Slifer, at the seminar.</P>
      <P>This will shave one percentage point from US economic expansion
as domestic production suffers. A further one percentage point of
growth could be lost as US businesses cut back on their capital
spending as they may withhold expansion in view of the Asian crisis,
he warned.</P>
      <P>Overall, world economic growth will slow to about 2 percent this
year, down significantly from the estimated 3.1 percent growth
achieved last year, he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AUSTRALIA ANNOUNCES SUPPORT FOR MILITARY ACTION AGAINST IRAQ</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Feb.  10  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australian Prime Minister John Howard,
declaring that Baghdad should not be allowed to "thumb its nose at
the rest of the world," announced that Australia will join an
international coalition backing possible US-led military action
against Iraq.</P>
      <P>At a press conference in Canberra, Howard said: "It is our
fervent desire that this matter be settled without resort to force.
We will continue in cooperation with the United States and other
countries to urge upon the Iraqi leadership the common sense ... that
Iraq comply with the resolutions of the United Nations and allow
inspection by the UNSCOM (UN Special Commission) teams of particular
sites in Iraq.</P>
      <P>"But if it does become necessary for a US-led coalition to use
force, then Australia has decided that it will make a contribution to
that effort," he said.</P>
      <P>Howard continued that if Iraq is "allowed to thumb its nose at
the rest of the world" by continuing to develop its capacity to
deliver chemical and biological weapons, the use of force "would
become regrettably necessary."</P>
      <P>"If Iraq were allowed to go on unchecked, then, of course, other
countries might be tempted to imitate what Iraq has done," he said.</P>
      <P>He said Canberra is discussing with Washington the sort of
contribution Australia would make, including up to a company from its
Special Air Service regiment to support US search and rescue
activities, two Boeing 707 tanker aircraft to provide air-to-air
refueling and specialist personnel to provide back-up in medical and
technical support, which together would involve up to between 200 and
250 people.</P>
      <P>He said the government will also be prepared to consider
providing other capabilities of a similar order in support of a
US-led war against Iraq.</P>
      <P>In 1991, Australia sent personnel and two warships to support the
UN-approved attack against Iraq during the Desert Storm strike.</P>
      <P>Earlier Tuesday, Howard announced in a statement that the Cabinet
had agreed in principle to a request from the United States to
participate in an international coalition should military action
against Iraq become necessary.</P>
      <P>"Our aim in doing so is to help enforce the UN Security Council's
resolutions, ensure that Iraq's chemical and biological arsenals are
not used or expanded, and prevent Saddam Hussein again becoming a
threat to the security of the Middle East and the world," the
statement said.</P>
      <P>Howard said backing the possible use of military force against
Iraq is "in the national interest of Australia."</P>
      <P>"Australia may be beyond the reach of Iraq's missiles. But we
have a direct national interest in ensuring that these weapons do not
proliferate and that the mechanisms established by the international
community to prevent this are as effective as possible. There can be
no doubt that allowing Iraq to flout its obligations will increase
the risks for the rest of the world, including Australia," the
statement said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CANADA SUPPORTS FORCE IN IRAQ IF DIPLOMACY FAILS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  Feb.  9  (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Canada supports the use of military force
against Iraq and its leader Saddam Hussein if diplomatic efforts fail
to end an impasse over United Nations weapons inspections, Canada's
Prime Minister Jean Chretien said Monday.</P>
      <P>"Tonight I want to lay out clearly before the people of Canada
why we believe their government should support military action if he
(Saddam) does not comply," Chretien said as the House of Commons
began an emergency debate on Iraq.</P>
      <P>He told the House: "This gives us no pleasure. Canada is not a
nation that rushes to embrace the use of force. We do not lightly
endorse military action. For us it is always the last resort."</P>
      <P>Canada's Parliament was debating a request from the United States
for Canada's help in possible strikes against Iraq, which could be
just weeks away.</P>
      <P>"Saddam has shown very clearly that he will not respect
diplomatic solutions, unless of course, they are accompanied by a
threat of intervention or an intervention. The least sign of weakness
or hesitation on our part will be interpreted as an incitement,"
Chretien said.</P>
      <P>He said Canada will lend military support to the US-led action,
"not combat troops, but it will mean a Canadian presence in the
action against Saddam Hussein."</P>
      <P>The right-wing Reform Party and Conservative Party lean toward
supporting the United States but have called into question Canada's
military preparedness after government cutbacks to the defense
budget.</P>
      <P>As in 1991, the leftist New Democratic Party (NDP) said, Canada
should be leading the search for a peaceful solution instead of
joining in military action. "There's nothing to be gained in the long
run through a strategy of provocation and saber rattling," said NDP
leader Alexa McDonough.</P>
      <P>Canada sent planes, warships and 2,200 soldiers during the 1991
Gulf War.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for Chretien said Sunday that Canada might contribute
transport and search-and-rescue services, but Defense Minister Art
Eggleton and Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy said Monday
there had been no detailed request from Washington.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GLIMMER OF HOPE IN PENG'S MURDER CASE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  10  (CNA)
(By Lin Wen-fen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Police are hopeful that the discovery on
Sunday of the cash card belonging to the late prominent women's
activist Peng Wan-ju may help them finally discover who was
responsible for her rape and murder more than one year ago.</P>
      <P>Peng's ATM card, along with a telephone card and Taipei mass
transit system tickets, was found by local residents in a remote
mango orchard in Hsinyuan, Pingtung County, south of Kaohsiung
County. The cash card carries Peng's signature.</P>
      <P>Peng last used the card on Nov. 30, 1996 at Sungshan Airport as
she was leaving Taipei for a meeting in Kaohsiung, the police said.
Her husband canceled use of the card soon after her murder.</P>
      <P>Police are hopeful they can discover the murderer's fingerprints
on the card.</P>
      <P>Peng, 48, the director of the women's affairs department of the
Democratic Progressive Party, went missing on Nov. 30, 1996, after
she left the Top Plaza Hotel in Kaohsiung City. Three days later, she
was found raped and murdered near a factory in Kaohsiung County. One
month later, Peng's purse was discovered under a bridge in Tungkang,
Pingtung.</P>
      <P>Believing Peng had been murdered by a taxi driver, the police
launched a comprehensive investigation of all taxi drivers in
Kaohsiung city and county, but turned up no suspects.</P>
      <P>Though one of the Top Plaza Hotel's security cameras recorded
that Peng left in a taxi, the tape was too fuzzy for the license
plate number to be made out. The tape was later sent to the United
States; but even American aerospace laser technology failed to make
the number clear enough to be read.</P>

    <HEADLINE>'NO HASTE' STRATEGY AIMED AT URGING BEIJING TO ADJUST POLICY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  10  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Vincent Siew said on Tuesday
that the ROC government's "no haste, be patient" strategy is aimed at
pushing Beijing to review and adjust its irrational policy toward
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Siew made the statement during a Chinese New Year cocktail
reception for Taiwan entrepreneurs with investment in mainland China.
The party was jointly organized by the Cabinet-level Mainland
Affairs Council (MAC), the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the
semi-official Straits Exchange Foundation and the private Chinese
National Federation of Industries (CNFI).</P>
      <P>Siew said as communist China has not renounced its attempt to
use force against Taiwan, the government must continue its "no
haste, be patient" policy to discourage investment across the
Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>"On the one hand, the policy will help reduce Taiwan companies'
business risks," Siew explained, adding that the policy is also
expected to press mainland authorities to modiy its irrational
policy toward Taiwan so as to create a more favorable climate for
development of cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>Siew urged local investors not to set their sights solely at the
mainland market. "We should be more far-sighted and broad-minded. We
should set our sights at the entire Asia-Pacific region and even the
whole world."</P>
      <P>The premier also expressed his hope that Taiwan investors, while
developing their business on the mainland, can forge positive
interactions with various mainland sectors and convey to
mainland officials and ordinary citizens Taiwan's good will,
sincerity and basic stances on developing cross-strait ties.
"Your efforts in these aspects will certainly help push cross-strait
relations to move in a stable, harmonious direction," he added.</P>
      <P>Siew said Taiwan has always kept its doors open for cross-strait
dialogue. "We hope mainland China will realistically face the
reality that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait is now ruled by two
separate governments, and will make positive response to our call
for resumption of long-stalled consultations on many practical
issues," the premier said, adding that continued contacts and
dialogue are the best way to foster good will and mutual trust.</P>
      <P>Siew further said the government will set up a one-stop service
counter to offer more convenient information services to Taiwan
companies with interests on the mainland and to assist
them in overcoming various obstacles they have encountered there.</P>
      <P>"We'll also cut red tape to allow local bsuinessmen to more
easily invite relevant mainland celebrities or business leaders to
visit Taiwan," the premier promised.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, MAC Chairman Chang King-yuh said
the "no haste, be patient" policy is not intended to cause a retreat
in cross-strait trade and economic exchanges. Under such a policy,
the government only imposes restrictions on mainland-bound
investment in high-technology industries, infrastructure construction
and some massive-scale invesmtent projects that might affect
domestic financial and economic development. "The policy doesn't
restrict other cross-strait invesment activities and will have no
impact on local small- and medium-sized enterprises," he stressed.</P>
      <P>CNFI President Kao Ching-yuan also urged local companies with
interests on the mainland to support the government's "no haste, be
patient" policy aimed at upholding the Republic of China's national
dignity and interests. He further advised them to pool wisdom
and resources to help push for early resumption of cross-strait
dialogue.</P>

      <P>Riot-hit Bima and Ende in Indonesia's Nusa
Tenggara were calm Tuesday as security authorities managed to bring
the two towns under control, local officials said.</P>
      <P>In Jakarta, scores of people staged a peaceful protest at Bank
Indonesia and the State Logistics Agency over the soaring prices of
essential commodities.</P>
      <P>West Nusa Tenggara deputy police chief Col. Budiman Sulaeman told
the Antara news agency that 15 men were arrested following Saturday's
riot in Bima, where a mob burned down three stores and damaged 20
others.</P>
      <P>Hundreds of police officers backed up by scores of soldiers were
still deployed in the streets to maintain order, Budiman said.</P>
      <P>In Ende in East Nusa Tenggara, residents of Chinese decent, whose
stores and houses were targeted in Sunday's riot, have been taking
refuge in local police and military stations, it said.</P>
      <P>Monday, the security officers in Ende fired several warning shots
to disperse a mob returning to the town center after East Nusa
Tenggara Governor Herman Musakabe -- accompanied by provincial
military chief Col. Bambang Sumardji and other officials -- visited
the riot scene.</P>
      <P>A curfew from 7 p.m. to 6 a.m. has been imposed in Ende since
Sunday night.</P>
      <P>At least 21 stores, mostly belonging to residents of Chinese
descent, were set ablaze and 71 damaged in Sunday's riot in the town.
All were looted, the news agency said, quoting Musakabe.</P>
      <P>A different account, however, was given by Ende's regent, Frans
Geddowolo, when contacted by the Jakarta Post from the East Nusa
Tenggara town of Maumere.</P>
      <P>He said 16 stores, two cars, and two motorcycles were torched in
the unrest in downtown Ende, after a demonstration by around 200
people turned violent.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a bomb hoax caused panic at Polonia airport in Medan
on Monday, forcing authorities to delay several flights.</P>
      <P>The airport chief, Col. Benyamin S. Dandel, said activities at
the international airport were not seriously affected but admitted
that several flights were delayed "for a little while."</P>
      <P>Local military spokesman Lt. Col. Agus Ramadhan said Monday night
that an object thought to be a bomb turned out to be only a "toy"
containing no explosives.</P>
      <P>No one claimed responsibility for the bomb scare.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's billionaires have moved even
higher in the list of the top 100 wealthiest families in Asia as
their counterparts in the region have suffered in the Asian financial
crisis, according to a new survey by Asia's Wealth Club magazine.</P>
      <P>Geoff Hiscock, author of the report, said in the mass circulation
newspaper The Australian on Tuesday that two Taiwanese tycoons made
this year's list of the 10 richest families in Asia.</P>
      <P>They are Tsai Wan-lin and his family, with their wealth at US$7.7
billion, and Wang Yung-ching and his family, worth US$4.9 billion.</P>
      <P>Tsai is listed as No. 3 among the Top 100 Wealthiest Families in
Asia, while Wang ranks ninth. Tsai was No. 5 in 1997, while Wang was
No. 14, according to the Asia's Wealth Club survey.</P>
      <P>Nine billionaires from Taiwan made the list of the 100 richest
families in Asia.</P>
      <P>In addition to Tsai and Wang, Taiwan's super rich include Wu
Tung-chin and his family, No. 11 in 1998 with riches of US$4.1
billion, up from No. 14 in 1997; Hsu Yu-ziang of the Far Eastern
Group at No. 37 with US$1.9 billion, up from No. 39; and Chang
Yung-fa of the Evergreen Group at No. 40 with assets of US$1.7
billion, climbing from No. 48 in 1997.</P>
      <P>Also among Taiwan's -- and Asia's richest -- people are Koo
Chen-fu and his family at No. 48 with US$1.5 billion, up from No. 65;
Shi Wen-long of the Chi Mei Corp. at No. 51 with US$1.4 billion

      <P>Topping the list of the richest people in Asia is the Sultan of
Brunei and his family, with their wealth totaling US$37 billion,
followed by Japan's Yoshiaki Tsutsumi and his family, worth US$9.6
billion.</P>
      <P>Some billionaires in Hong Kong declined in rank due to falling
property prices in the former British colony.</P>
      <P>Walter, Thomas and Raymond Kwok of Hong Kong's Sun Hung Kai
Properties, with their wealth of US$7 billion, are No. 4 this year,
down two places from 1997.</P>
      <P>Lee Shau-kee of Henderson Land ranks No. 5 with assets of US$6
billion, down one notch from 1997, while Li Ka-shing and his family
remain unchanged in their ranking of No. 6.</P>
      <P>The Asian billionaires hardest hit by the region's financial
crisis are in Indonesia and Thailand.</P>
      <P>Indonesian President Suharto and his family rank No. 34 in 1998,
plummeting from ninth in 1997. The richest Chinese-Indonesian tycoon,
Liem Sioe Liong, and his Salim Group rank No. 39 this year, compared
to No. 18 in 1997.</P>
      <P>Chatri Sophonpanich and his family of the Bangkok Bank, the
largest in Thailand, suffered falling fortunes and rank No. 44 in
1998 compared to No. 30 in 1997.</P>
      <P>Also hard hit are some billionaires in South Korea, including Lee

    <HEADLINE>OCAC HEAD EXPRESSES CONCERN OVER CHINESE DISSIDENT'S ORDEAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  10  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Chiao Jen-ho, head of the Republic of
China's Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission (OCAC), on Tuesday
expressed concern over US-based Chinese pro-democracy activist Wang
Bingzhang's recent ordeal in mainland China.</P>
      <P>Wang, who recently traveled to mainland China under an assumed
name in an attempt to drum up support for the establishment of an
opposition political party, was first arrested by mainland Chinese
public security officials in Anhui province on Feb. 6 and then
deported on Feb. 9 on charges of subversion.</P>
      <P>Chiao ridiculed the mainland Chinese authorities' irrational
treatment of Wang, asking why Chinese people are not allowed to show
concern over human rights in mainland China while they can do so in
the United States.</P>
      <P>If Chinese people can express concern over human rights in the
United States but cannot do the same in mainland China, it is obvious
that mainland China must have different standards of human rights
than the United States, Chiao said.</P>
      <P>Chiao reiterated the OCAC's stance of supporting all activities
that uphold democracy and human rights. He said he cannot understand
what is wrong with Chinese being concerned over Chinese affairs, or
what is wrong about Chinese promotion of freedom and democracy in
Chinese society.</P>
      <P>According to CNA sources in Los Angeles, Wang, founder of the
pro-democracy activists magazine "China Spring," told the public
security authorities who escorted him during his deportation that he
will try again to sneak back to mainland China whenever he gets the
chance.</P>
      <P>Wang, 50, who is on mainland China's most-wanted list of exiled
dissidents, returned covertly to mainland China in mid-January. He
remained undetected for the first two weeks until Feb. 5, when one of
his relatives in Nanjing was taken away for questioning by public
security authorities.</P>
      <P>Wang escaped to the central province of Anhui, where he stayed
with friends before being detained on Feb. 6 and held for three days
of questioning.</P>
      <P>He was deported and flown back to Los Angeles on Feb. 9 following
a relatively quick decision by the mainland authorities, a move which
human rights groups said was probably made out of political
consideration.</P>
      <P>Before expelling Wang, the mainland authorities confiscated his
video camera, tape recorder, camera, wallet and credit cards.</P>

of air combat maneuvering instrumentation (ACMI) to Beijing, a
spokesman for the Republic of China's Ministry of National Defense
(MND) said on Tuesday that US arms sales to Taiwan are in no way
affected by Washington's engagement with Beijing and that the ROC
armed forces have the will and means to protect the island.</P>
      <P>In response to a report published in Monday's local daily United
Daily News that Washington is set to sell the ACMI system to Beijing
to allow mainland China's air force to upgrade its pilots' combat
tactics and techniques, MND spokesman Kung Fan-ding said that thus
far, the MND cannot confirm the news, let along the specifications of
the ACMI system mentioned in the reports.</P>
      <P>However, Kung said, the armed forces is pushing ahead with a
program to upgrade its own ACMI system, which will be patterned upon
the latest system used by the US Air Force.</P>
      <P>He said the MND is confident that the new program, as well as the
new generation jet fighters acquired by the armed forces, will ensure
ROC air superiority over mainland China.</P>
      <P>Regarding concerns raised by the newspaper that the increasing
military exchanges between Beijing and Washington might lead to cuts
in US arms sales to Taiwan, Kung said that Washington is sticking to
its obligations under the Taiwan Relations Act to provide Taiwan with
sufficient weapons for its defense, despite persistent pressure from
Beijing to stop such sales.</P>
      <P>This policy was reconfirmed in Oct. 1997 when US President Bill
Clinton met Beijing's visiting leader Jiang Zemin in Washington and
told him that US arms sales to Taiwan are absolutely legal and brook
no foreign interference.</P>
      <P>US Defense Secretary William Cohen reiterated this policy in
January, 1998 when he told Beijing leaders at the end of a visit to
mainland China that "we will keep on selling military equipment for
defensive purposes to Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Furthermore, Kung added, Washington has responded positively to
repeated calls from Taiwan made at various conferences and meetings
with US officials that US engagement with Beijing should not
jeopardize Taiwan's interests, and that the US should live up to its
obligations under the Taiwan Relations Act by continuing to sell
defensive weapons to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, on a related subject, Kung said the ROC Navy's plan to
build its own submarines is still under careful review, adding that
the navy has not given up its efforts to acquire submarines from
abroad, despite Beijing's attempts to block such purchases.</P>
      <P>Defense Minister Chiang Chung-ling said on Thursday that Taiwan
is considering building indigenous submarines because of the
vociferous objections raised by Beijing when any foreign country
attempts to sell military equipment to Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHUNGHWA TELECOM OPENS BANGKOK OFFICE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Bangkok, Feb. 10 (CNA)
(By F. C. Kuo and Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice Prime Minister Supachai Panitchpak of
Thailand said on Tuesday that the Thai government welcomes the
opening here of a branch office of the Taipei-based Chunghwa Telecom
Co. Ltd. and called for greater cooperation between the business
communities of Thailand and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Addressing those attending the inauguration of the office,
including more than 200 local and Taiwan business leaders, Supachai
hailed the move by Chunghwa Telecom, which he said will upgrade the
level of Thailand's telecommunications industry and help strengthen
cooperation in the field among Asian countries.</P>
      <P>Supachai said Thailand is actively pushing for the opening up of
its telecommunications market by 1999 under the liberalization
guidelines set by the World Trade Organization. Over the past five
years, the number of underground telephone lines in Thailand has
increased threefold to 7 million, while there are now more cellular
telephones and pagers in the country than ever before, at 1.5 million
and 1.1 million, respectively, he added.</P>
      <P>Supachai stressed that Chunghwa Telecom has grabbed a good
opportunity to venture into Thailand, as both the Telephone
Organization of Thailand and Communications Authority of Thailand
(CAT) are undergoing privatization.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, Stephan Hsu, the Republic of
China's representative to Thailand, said the move by Chunghwa Telecom
amid the ongoing financial crisis plaguing the Asian region shows
that Taiwan businesses have confidence Thailand will recover from the
current turmoil and that bilateral cooperation will prove fruitful.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that Chunghwa Telecom and the CAT have long enjoyed
a cordial friendship under the framework of international
organizations, CAT President Asauvin Saovaros expressed the hope that
the opening of Chunghwa Telecom's office in Bangkok will help boost
two-way cooperation.</P>
      <P>Telephone Organization of Thailand President Satien Pitaganun
said the memorandum of understanding signed between Chunghwa Telecom
and his organization will pave the way for greater bilateral
cooperation in the future, while Chunghwa Telecom President Chen Yao
said the accord is a step toward breaking into the Thai market.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the agreement, the two sides will hold regular
meetings on the exploration of business opportunities and engage in
exchanges of information and visits by personnel.</P>
      <P>The Bangkok office is Chunghwa Telecom's fourth office abroad.
The firm already has branch offices in Washington, D.C., Hong Kong
and Tokyo.</P>
      <P>A 7-member Chunghwa Telecom delegation led by Chen, which arrived
here on Monday, is scheduled to return to Taiwan on Friday.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PROTESTING FARMERS SHOWER POLICE WITH EGGS, PIG FECES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  11  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Farmers showered police guarding the
American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) with eggs and pig feces during a
protest on Wednesday against the government's alleged move to open
Taiwan to US pork in exchange for Washington dropping its push to pry
open the island's rice market.</P>
      <P>The farmers first threw pig feces toward the doors of AIT,
Washington's de facto embassy here, located on Hsinyi Road in eastern
Taipei. They then vented their anger on the police, adding eggs to
their arsenal.</P>
      <P>Nearly 5,000 pig farmers turned up in Taipei from around the
island Wednesday morning in 110 tourist buses.</P>
      <P>Protest organizers among the farmers had said earlier they would
rally 10,000 people on Wednesday in front of the Presidential Office
to protest the alleged trade-off.</P>
      <P>Taipei and Washington are now engaged in bilateral talks over
Taiwan's accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO).</P>
      <P>Fearing that Taiwan negotiators would push ahead with the
island's bid to join the WTO at the expense of local pig farmers'
interests, the protesters took to Taipei streets to make their
message heard.</P>
      <P>AIT responded to the barrage by lowering its outer steel gate.
The liaison office had not been informed about the protest in
advance, according to AIT officials.</P>
      <P>Daniel Martinez, chief of AIT's Agricultural Affairs Section,
stepped out from the building later and received a protest letter
from representatives of the rally.</P>
      <P>Martinez promised to convey the letter and the farmers' concern
to authorities in Washington.</P>
      <P>At noon, Peng Tzuo-kuei, the Republic of China's top official in
charge of agricultural affairs, again reassured the pig farmers that
the government would never sacrifice their interests in an attempt to
protect Taiwan's rice market.</P>
      <P>The ROC officials currently in Washington for the ongoing WTO
bilateral talks with the United States will try their utmost to
safeguard Taiwan farmers' interests to the greatest possible extent,
he added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Ling Shiang-nung, vice chairman of the Council of
Agriculture and Taiwan's top negotiator in agricultural talks, asked
Taiwan pig farmers not to worry, saying that he and his colleagues
will try their best to seek America's understanding of the equal
importance of Taiwan's rice, pig and chicken farming sectors, and
that none of them should be harmed in international negotiations.</P>
      <P>ROC negotiators, headed by Vice Economics Minister Lin Yi-fu,
failed to reach a significant consensus with their US counterparts on
Tuesday in the ongoing WTO bilateral talks, scheduled to be the final
round of US-ROC consultations before Taiwan is formally admitted into
the world trade regulatory body.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN BIZ LEADERS SHOULDN'T ACCEPT M'LAND POLITICAL POSTS: MAC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Feb.   11  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The time is not ripe for Taiwan
businesspersons to accept appointments to the national committee of
the mainland Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference
(CPPCC), a spokesman for the cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC) said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Fu Don-cheng, director of the MAC's Department of Economic
Affairs, said that without government approval, Taiwan
businesspersons who accept a CPPCC post or other prominent
politically sensitive jobs in mainland China may risk being fined or
experiencing entrance problems upon their return to the island.</P>
      <P>Fu was referring to Huang Tzi-yu, vice chairwoman of the Taiwan
Business Association in Beijing and a big name in mainland China's
real estate sector, who was reportedly appointed to the Ninth
National Committee of the CPPCC in late January.</P>
      <P>Since Beijing has long politicized Taiwan people's economic
activities in mainland China, the motives behind Huang's CPPCC
appointment are highly complex, Fu pointed out, saying that it is not
yet time for any Taiwan businessperson to accept a politically
sensitive position, such as on a CPPCC committee.</P>
      <P>Although Fu said that the MAC has not received any information on
Huang's alleged appointment, he noted that according to the 33rd
Article of the Statute on Relations between the People of Taiwan and
Mainland China, Taiwan individuals or organizations that become
members of or take jobs in public-run organizations or institutions
in mainland China may receive fines ranging from NT$100,000 to
NT$500,000 (US$3,049-US$15,244).</P>
      <P>According to a United Daily News report, Huang's father was
formerly a heavyweight figure in the ruling Kuomintang who was once a
National Assembly member.</P>
      <P>The report said Huang began doing business in mainland China more
than one decade ago through a front company in Hong Kong. Venturing
into the real estate business only a few years ago, she became famous
by developing the renowned European-style "Ziyun Villa" near Beijing.</P>
      <P>Some members of the mainland-based Taiwan business sector believe
that Huang further impressed the Beijing authorities with her recent
donation of 1 million yuan (US$120,337) to earthquake victims in
Hebei Province's Zhangbei area.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHINESE DISSIDENT WANG BINGZHANG TELLS OF ARREST BY MAINLAND POLICE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Los  Angeles,  Feb.  11 (CNA)
(By Philip Liu and Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The clandestine journey of mainland
Chinese exiled dissident Wang Bingzhang came to a dramatic end with
his expulsion on Monday by the Beijing government. In an interview
upon his arrival in Los Angeles from Shanghai, Wang told his side of
the events surrounding his mainland China sojourn.</P>
      <P>Wang, 50, slipped into mainland China via the Portuguese enclave
of Macau on Jan. 23, with the intention of forming an opposition
party.</P>
      <P>Wang said he stayed in the mainland for about three weeks, during
which period he met and exchanged views with democracy campaigners in
Shanghai and nearby provinces.</P>
      <P>Nothing much happened until Feb. 5, according to Wang, when
police issued an arrest warrant for him and began detaining and
questioning dissidents and relatives he had met. Since he had nowhere
to hide, he went to the residence of his friend Wang Tingjin in the
city of Bengbu, Anhui Province, a veteran of the democracy movement
of the late 1970s.</P>
      <P>However, Wang Tingjin has always been under close surveillance by
the mainland security police and Wang Bingzhan was seized by the
security police on Feb. 6 in Bengbu and detained till the afternoon
of Feb. 8.</P>
      <P>During his three days in captivity, Wang Bingzhan was questioned
repeatedly by security police. The investigation stopped abruptly on
Feb. 8 when five armed policemen came in and escorted him back to
Shanghai.</P>
      <P>Arriving in Shanghai in the very early hours of Feb. 9, he was
given breakfast and taken directly to the airport to be returned into
exile. A formal document was read by a security police official
asserting that Wang had sneaked into mainland China to subvert the
government.</P>
      <P>His camera, tape recorder, video camera, wallet and credit cards
were all confiscated by security police prior to his departure.</P>
      <P>Wang speculated that his swift release was the result of moral
support from the international community and bargaining between
Washington and Beijing, pointing out that Beijing has probably
learned from past experience that is better to drop a hot potato than
to hold on to it. He added that the Beijing leadership is most likely
trying to foster a more liberal image by its handling of the
situation.</P>
      <P>Wang said that he is confident the democratic movement in
mainland China will continue to develop, and that if necessary he
will try to return to his own country.</P>
      <P>He was slated to leave Los Angeles for San Francisco on Tuesday.</P>

(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Nearly half a million visitors came to
Singapore from Taiwan last year, according to figures released by the
Singapore Tourism Board (STB) Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan stood as Singapore's fourth largest tourist market, with
499,782 visitors in 1997.</P>
      <P>Indonesia topped the list of Singapore's top 10 tourist markets
last year, registering 1,171,564 visitors from that neighboring
country. Japan was second with 1,094,040 visitor arrivals, followed
by Malaysia, with 681,829 visitors.</P>

    <HEADLINE>REGIONAL WOES TO HIT S'PORE TOURISM FURTHER THIS YEAR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  Feb.  11  (CNA)
(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>For the first time since 1983, the
annual figure of visitor arrivals to Singapore has fallen, dropping
1.3 percent last year, with an even greater fall expected this year.</P>
      <P>The Singapore Tourism Board (STB) said Tuesday that the numbers
of visitors to Singapore have come down from 7.29 million in 1996 to
7,197,963 last year.</P>
      <P>This year, the STB is expecting an 8 to 10 percent drop, which
means that some 6.5 million visitors might come here in 1998.</P>
      <P>Given these figures, the target of 10 million visitors by the
year 2000 in the STB's tourism blueprint, Tourism 21, has been put
back four to five years.</P>
      <P>STB chief executive Yeo Khee Leng attributed the decline in
numbers to the haze and the regional economic crisis in the second
half of last year.</P>
      <P>The haze, caused by forest fires in Indonesia, hit long-haul
travel to the ASEAN region, while the currency crisis made it more
expensive for people from the affected Southeast Asian countries to
visit Singapore.</P>
      <P>The drop became noticeable in the last quarter, when tourist
arrivals fell by 14.4 percent. In the first three quarters of last
year, Singapore was on target for a 3 to 4 percent growth, Yeo said.</P>
      <P>Spelling gloom for the rest of this year, he pointed out that
besides the threat of haze and the regional economic crunch, a third
factor looming ahead was a potential crisis in the Persian Gulf.</P>
      <P>If war breaks out in the Gulf, Singapore can expect even fewer
visitors, he said.</P>
      <P>The number of visitors from ASEAN countries, hit by the economic
crunch, is expected to decline by 15 to 20 percent this year.</P>
      <P>Hotels in Singapore are expected to feel the brunt of the
decline. Average hotel occupancy rates -- about 79.5 percent last
year -- are expected to go down.</P>
      <P>They may also be forced to lower their room rates.</P>
      <P>To lure tourists to Singapore, the STB will turn its attention to
Australia, Europe and North America. Other markets with potential,
such as mainland China, India, Hong Kong and Taiwan, will also be
tapped.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A pornographic website that billed itself
as the largest of its kind for Taiwan residents has been raided by
local law enforcement personnel, marking a victory for the police in
their crackdown against the world of cyber-crime.</P>
      <P>Since the Chinese-language "Big Black Market" began operating
through a foreign-based website three months ago, around 400,000
Internet users have visited it and sampled its thousands of erotic
pictures, a spokesman for the Taipei-based Criminal Investigation
Bureau said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The spokesman revealed that the website, developed by a disabled
male nicknamed Hsiau Yang, had 10 pages of selections and provided
links to similar foreign sites.</P>
      <P>In addition to erotic pictures, the Big Black Market also
provided illegal services such as introductions to prostitutes and
gambling, the bureau said.</P>
      <P>The police arrested Hsiau Yang on Tuesday in downtown Taipei,
charging him with violating intellectual property rights, offending
morality, allowing minors access to sexual material and other related
crimes.</P>
      <P>They seized a number of erotic books and compact discs, and many
receipts for money allegedly gained through illegal means.</P>
      <P>The case has been delivered to prosecutors for further
investigation, according to the police.</P>

      <P>Economics Minister Wang Chih-kang on
Wednesday urged Taiwan businesses to temporarily stop their
commercial activities in Indonesia, where anti-Chinese riots have not
yet been suppressed.</P>
      <P>Citing an already signed accord on investment guarantees between
Taiwan and the Southeast Asian country, Wang said that if any Taiwan
businessmen suffer losses as a result of the unrest, Taipei will help
them to seek compensation from Jakarta under the terms of the
agreement.</P>
      <P>He noted that his ministry is very concerned over the riots which
have endangered the safety of Taiwan businessmen in Indonesia, adding
that a task force is standing by to deal with any sudden occurrence.</P>
      <P>According to foreign media reports, large-scale violence sparked
by price hikes and shortages of essential goods has forced numerous
ethnic Chinese in Indonesia to seek the protection of the military

      <P>Soaring prices and mass layoffs caused by the destructive Asian
financial and economic crisis are tearing the Southeast Asian country
apart, with recent reports saying that rationing of basic foodstuffs

    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia is preparing to send elite
troops to the Middle East to support a US-led offensive against Iraq
if Washington should decide to order a military strike to destroy
Iraqi facilities for chemical and biological weapons.</P>
      <P>Defense Department sources said it will be the first time
Australia has sent troops into combat since the Vietnam War.</P>
      <P>The deployment of about 110 Special Air Services (SAS) troops
would be one of the most dangerous military assignments undertaken by
Australians since the Vietnam War, the sources said.</P>
      <P>The elite soldiers would be used to rescue US or British pilots
brought down behind Iraqi lines, they said.</P>
      <P>Armed with a submachine gun or carbine fitted with a grenade
launcher, a knife, a pistol, medical equipment, and a variety of
grenades and other explosives, the SAS are among the most highly
trained personnel of their type in the world, the sources said.</P>
      <P>They would be divided into small teams of perhaps of five or six
men, each of them multi-skilled, or in the jargon "cross-trained."</P>
      <P>The SAS was established in the late 1950s as part of Australia's
Special Forces designed to build on the unconventional warfare skills
learned by commandos during World War II. They train and operate
largely in secret, the sources said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CEPD DELEGATION RETURNS FROM GERMAN TRIP TO WOO BAYER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  11  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A ranking government official and chief
delegate of a fact-finding mission to Germany said on Wednesday that
the Bayer Group's safety measures are well above standard levels and
that the delegation will report to the provincial council on the
issue in a last-ditch effort to save a NT$50 billion investment by
the German pharmaceutical giant in central Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Y.S. Liu, vice chairman of the Cabinet-level Council for Economic
Planning and Development (CEPD), said the delegation will make the
report at a temporary session called by the Taiwan Provincial
Assembly on Monday, which he said will be the last chance to woo
Bayer back to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The company announced in December that it was relocating the
proposed site of a new production plant for toluene di-isocyanate
(TDI) from central Taiwan's Taichung Harbor to the United States
after then-newly elected Taichung County Magistrate Liao Yung-lai of
the opposition Democratic Progressive Party insisted on holding a
public referendum to decide the fate of the plan following strong
opposition from local residents.</P>
      <P>Liu said Bayer promised to carry out the investment project in
Taichung Harbor, as long as the Taiwan Provincial Assembly approves
the land lease contract for Bayer by the end of this month, opening
the way for construction of relevant facilities in September as
scheduled.</P>
      <P>Liu, who returned on Tuesday after a six-day visit to Bayer's
headquarters in Dormagen at the head of an 11-member delegation
composed of petrochemical experts and public opinion leaders, said
the delegation found Bayer's safety and environmental protection
measures to be very satisfactory and that Bayer is still willing to
set up the TDI plant at Taichung Harbor as long as the project can
proceed smoothly.</P>
      <P>He said that the company made several pledges to the local
communities if they allow the project to go ahead:</P>
      <P>-- to set up a task force to monitor construction of the
facilities and to communicate with local neighborhoods on a regular
basis</P>
      <P>-- to employ local people</P>
      <P>-- to ensure that Bayer executives will live inside the harbor
area</P>
      <P>-- to ensure that local production facilities are built in
accordance with parent company regulations in Germany</P>
      <P>-- to provide technology transfers from Bayer to Taiwan
businesses</P>
      <P>-- to provide insurance for workers at the plant and local
residents</P>
      <P>Referring to phosgene, a poisonous gas necessary in the
manufacture of TDI and the element most feared by local residents,
Liu said it is not as terrible as is widely believed by its
opponents, if handled correctly.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN  WILL NOT SACRIFICE FARMERS' INTERESTS IN WTO TALKS WITH US</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  11  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government will not sacrifice the
interests of Taiwan's farmers in its current round of talks with the
United States over Taiwan's terms for entry into the World Trade
Organization (WTO), Minister of Economic Affairs Wang Chih-kang
reaffirmed on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Wang said the opening of Taiwan's markets to US agricultural
products has been one of the toughest issues in the latest round of
talks, but he stressed that the government will not seek early entry
into the world trade regulatory body at the expense of local farmers.</P>
      <P>The 17th round of Taiwan-US WTO talks opened in Washington D.C.
on Monday.</P>
      <P>Reports have said that Taiwan is ready to make major concessions
regarding the opening of Taiwan to US pork in exchange for Washington
dropping its attempts to pry open the island's rice market, in order
to facilitate early WTO entry.</P>
      <P>According to the reports, Taiwan will first lower tariffs by 15
percent on imported US pork belly and offal after it enters the WTO.
After the sixth year, the tariffs will be lowered by another 50
percent and eventually they will be brought down to below 7.5
percent. After one year at this level, Taiwan will cut tariffs on
pork products altogether, the reports said.</P>
      <P>According to an official from the US pork producer's association,
Taiwan people consume the most pork per head in Asia, but has refused
to open its markets to imports of US pork belly and offal, which he
said runs counter to WTO norms.</P>
      <P>Wang's words came amid angry protests from domestic pig farmers
over the US pressure on Taiwan to open up to imports of chicken and
pork products.</P>
      <P>Some 5,000 demonstrators from all over the island, representing
pig farmers, meat producers and the animal feed sector, took to the
streets of Taipei on Wednesday morning and marched to the American
Institute in Taiwan (AIT), the de facto embassy of the United States
in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>They waved banners reading "Americans are exploiters," and "no
concessions in US-Taiwan talks" and threw eggs and pig manure at the
door of the AIT building.</P>
      <P>Minor scuffles were reported between the protesters and police,
but no one was arrested. An AIT official later accepted a letter of
protest from the demonstrators.</P>
      <P>Around 300 of the protesters went to the Ministry of Economic
Affairs later in the afternoon to continue to publicize their cause.</P>
      <P>Vice Economic Affairs Minister Yiin Chii-ming said the Taiwan
government will never succumb to the US requests to open Taiwan's
meat markets in exchange for Washington dropping its push to pry open
the island's rice market, pointing out that if Taiwan succumbs to the
requests, the country's pig population will drop by 2.1 million
within three years, and the production value of the pig raising
sector will stand to lose over NT$12 billion (US$363 million)
annually.</P>
      <P>Yiin assured the representatives that his ministry will continue
to fight for their best interests.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has so far concluded bilateral WTO consultations with 23
contracting parties to the world trade regulatory organization. The
US is one of the three WTO members that have yet to finalize
negotiations with Taiwan, the other two being the European Union and
Switzerland.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ASIAN CRISIS FORCES AUSTRALIA TO ADOPT TOUGH BUDGET</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Feb.  11 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia, suffering the effects of the
Asian economic crisis, is expected to adopt a tough budget for fiscal
1998-99, with Treasurer Peter Costello admitting the impact from the
Asian meltdown is worse than first thought.</P>
      <P>"Don't underestimate the impact of Asia. We haven't seen anything
like this before in our lifetime and it will have an effect on
Australia," he said.</P>
      <P>"We have to continue to work at strengthening the Australian
economy because we are in very uncertain times, and this is going to
have a big impact," he added.</P>
      <P>He said the upcoming budget will need to be tough to deal with
the impact of the Asian crisis.</P>
      <P>Several surveys and authoritative forecasts point to a much
harder landing for the Australian economy this year.</P>
      <P>Two months ago, Costello predicted that the Australian government
would have a budget surplus of A$2.5 billion for 1998-99, rising to
A$5 billion in 1999-2000 and A$10.4 billion in 2000-2001.</P>
      <P>But now he is unsure whether the targets can be met in the face
of declining exports to Asia.</P>
      <P>The Asian crisis will slash Australia's economic growth to 2.4
percent in 1998 from 3.6 percent and will drive the unemployment rate
back to 9.6 percent from the current 8.1 percent, as well as blowing
out the country's current account deficit, according to the
influential Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) in London.</P>
      <P>The EIU also warned that Australia's "reforms will proceed more
slowly" if the Labor Party wins this year's general election.</P>
      <P>The organization said Australia's current account deficit will
become "the most pressing problem in 1998," as rapid domestic growth
sucks in imports while slowing demand from Asia hurts its exports.</P>
      <P>It predicts the external deficit will peak at 5.3 percent of
Australia's gross domestic product this calendar year but will remain
above 5 percent for a further two years until Australia shakes off
the adverse impact of an El Nino-generated drought as well as the
effects of the regional downturn and falling commodity prices.</P>

      <P>An estimated 1 million people were on hand
to watch Premier Vincent Siew light up the theme display at the
Taipei Lantern Festival in downtown Taipei which kicked off its
five-day gala Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Premier Siew and his wife Chu Shu-hsien walked into the Chiang
Kai-shek Memorial Hall amid the drumbeats of the Chu Percussion Group
in the early evening. Siew pressed a button at 6:30 p.m. to light up
the theme lantern, which was in the shape of a giant tiger to signify
the Year of the Tiger, which began on Jan. 28 according to the
Chinese lunar calendar.</P>
      <P>Spectators gazed in awe as the huge display began to beam laser
lights in all directions.</P>
      <P>Organizers of the festival distributed small lanterns to children
in the afternoon. The flickering of small lanterns as well as various
colorful lanterns displayed all around the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial
Hall plaza added to the festive atmosphere under a full moon.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, President Lee Teng-hui presided over a similar lantern
festival in Kaohsiung, southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The theme lantern, a 15-meter-tall structure in the shape of a
large ship sailing the high seas, cost about NT$10 million (US$303,
000) and is equipped with laser lights and features changing patterns
of sound and light.</P>
      <P>As President Lee lighted up the theme lantern, ships moored in
the Kaohsiung Harbor also sounded their horns for one minute to
celebrate the first lantern festival held in Kaohsiung.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CRIME-FILLED TV NEWS CONCERNS PRESIDENT LEE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  11  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Concerned over the extensive coverage of
violent crimes seen in television news reports, ruling Kuomintang
(KMT) Chairman and ROC President Lee Teng-hui on Wednesday instructed
KMT Secretary-General John Chang to consult with the heads of three
TV networks on their reporting.</P>
      <P>After hearing a report by KMT member Lin Cheng-chih, who is also
chairwoman of the Cabinet-level Council for Cultural Affairs, on a
government promotion of international cultural exchanges at a regular
meeting of the KMT Central Standing Committee, Lee expressed serious
concern over the fact that local TV news reports often lead off with
coverage of criminal cases.</P>
      <P>KMT spokeswomen Huang Lee-ching quoted Lee afterward as saying
that the unanimous priority given by TV stations to criminal cases
could mislead people into believing that Taiwan is a crime-infested
society.</P>
      <P>"The Republic of China is not a place where crime is the only
news worth reporting," Lee was quoted as saying. Huang said the party
chairman also worried about the often graphic descriptions of
criminal acts in news reports which, he said, might negatively
influence young viewers.</P>
      <P>Out of concern about the negative national image projected by
crime-oriented news coverage, Huang said that Lee had asked Chang to
urge the heads of three local TV stations -- TTV, CTS, and CTC, which
are either owned by the KMT or controlled by the ruling party through
government agencies, to alter their editorial policies by giving more
prominent coverage and precedence in reporting sequence to cultural
news items.</P>
      <P>Such concern is understandable after angry protesters demanded
that Lee apologize for the government's alleged failure to maintain
law and order last May amid mass-media criticism of failure by police
to solve several high-profile criminal cases.</P>
      <P>In response to the KMT chairman's criticism, the news department
heads of the three networks on Wednesday, were receptive to Lee's
comments, but they blamed the phenomenon on fierce competition among
local mass media and their audiences' apparent preference for news
about disasters, scandals and violence.</P>
      <P>Noting the immense influence of the electronic mass media in
society and its role as an educational tool, CTC news executive Hu
Hsueh-chu said that her department has tried to balance the negative
stories by airing four minutes of coverage on the brighter aspects of
society in its evening news programs every Monday, Wednesday and
Friday.</P>
      <P>However, she promised to address Lee's concerns by more carefully
screening the newsworthiness of the stories being aired while making
some adjustments in the order of appearance. She added that footage
of bloodshed, violence and sexual images have already been removed
from CTV programs.</P>
      <P>TTV news head Ku An-sheng said that TTV will heed Lee's
directions and give more emphasis to positive news stories, adding
that this is already the long-standing policy of the station.</P>
      <P>CTS news head Chou Hsiao-hui echoed Lee's opinions by stating
that the rebroadcast of negative local news reports by foreign TV
stations has raised questions among international audiences about the
state of Taiwan's social security and the safety of living on the
island.</P>
      <P>Although admitting that the fierce competition among local mass
media could force TV news departments to resort to sensationalism in
order to boost ratings, Chou promised to do his best to reverse the
trend.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's fourth TV network, the private-owned Formosa TV, is
controlled by members of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party
and was spared from Lee's criticism.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Vincent Siew on Wednesday told
visiting Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim that Taiwan is
willing to do its best to contribute to the financial and economic
stability in Southeast Asia.</P>
      <P>Siew said that Taiwan's experience in coping with the financial
crisis might be of help to Malaysia and other Asian countries, adding
that the sound economic fundamentals and adequate government measures
have helped the island weather the financial crisis.</P>
      <P>Taiwan maintains close trade and investment relations with the
Southeast Asian countries, Siew said, pointing out that Taiwan
investment in the region reached US$38 billion last year, while trade
between Taiwan and the region totaled some US$27 billion during the
same period. In addition, currently over 200,000 laborers, mainly
from Thailand and the Philippines, are working in Taiwan, Siew added.</P>
      <P>Saying that Taiwan has good reason to be concerned about the
economic and financial situations in Southeast Asia, Siew stressed
that Taiwan would like to offer assistance in helping restore the
region's stability. He also expressed hope that the Southeast Asian
countries can maintain more substantial contacts with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Anwar told the ROC premier that although having been hit by the
regional financial turmoil erupted in July, Malaysia's economic and
financial situations have been stabilized. The Malaysian ringgit is
recovering from its record low, while the stock market continues to
rally as investors have restored confidence. He said that now is the
best time to invest in his country.</P>
      <P>After their meeting, ROC government spokesman Chen Chien-jen said
that both Siew and Anwar stressed that their meeting was mainly for
discussing economic and financial issues, and that there were no
political motivations involved.</P>
      <P>The Malaysian vice premier arrived in Taipei on Wednesday morning
for a short private visit. Before meeting with Siew, he had lunch
with Finance Minister Paul Chiu to exchange views on current
situation in Malaysia.</P>
      <P>Later in the day, Anwar met with Y.D. Sheu, governor of the
Central Bank of China (CBC). According to CBC Deputy Governor C.J.
Liang, Sheu expressed hope that the Malaysian government will approve
more local banks to operate offshore banking units (OBUs) in the
Southeast Asian country. OBU approval can provide Taiwan businessmen
with loans to facilitate their operations there, Liang said.</P>
      <P>He added that the drastic depreciation of the Southeast Asian
currencies has promoted many regional countries to raise bank
interest rates to protect the value of their currencies, which
unavoidably aggravates Taiwan businessmen's financial burdens.</P>
      <P>Liang said that the International Commercial Bank of China and
United World Chinese Commercial Bank started their OBUs in Malaysia
in mid-January, while applications by the First Commercial Bank and
the Chinatrust Commercial Bank are pending.</P>

was still "under arrangement." His statement seemed to rule out
earlier speculation that Kim would meet with Chang "unexpectedly" to
avoid possible opposition from Beijing.</P>
      <P>Chang is also expected to meet with Kim Jong-pil, the leader of
the Korean United Liberal Democrats. However, like his proposed
meeting with Kim Dae-jung, that encounter was not listed on Chang's
official itinerary released by the Taipei representative office in
Seoul.</P>
      <P>Chang also told reporters that he had turned down an invitation
to visit South Korea during his tenure as ROC foreign minister
because his hosts wanted to meet him only in places outside the
capital of Seoul.</P>
      <P>Chang is slated to return to Taipei on Saturday.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NORTHWEST ADDING TAIPEI-OSAKA ROUTE TO PACIFIC SERVICES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Feb.  12  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Northwest Airlines, the leading US
commercial operator in the Asia-Pacific region, is scheduled to begin
daily flights between the Japanese city of Osaka and Taipei on April
5, according to a company spokesman for Northwest Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The addition of the Osaka-Taipei flights to Northwest's Asian
services will expand the choices of Taiwan passengers bound for
either Japan or the United States. The decision was made in
consideration of Taiwan's solid economy, which has remained
relatively unscathed by the economic crisis in Asia, the spokesman
said.</P>
      <P>"We have confidence in Taiwan's economy, and project good
passenger loads for the new Osaka-Taipei flights," he added.</P>
      <P>Starting from April 5, Northwest will operate a daily flight from
Seattle to Osaka's Kansei International Airport, with continuing
service to Taipei. That flight will depart Osaka at 5:30 p.m. and
arrive at Taipei's CKS International Airport at about 7:10 p.m. The
same aircraft will leave Taipei at 9:40 the following morning for the
return to Osaka, continuing on to Seattle after a short stopover,
according to the Northwest plan.</P>
      <P>The Osaka-Taipei flights will make Taipei the second Asian city
serviced by the US airline from Osaka. Taiwan passengers can use the
route to reach other US destinations, including Seattle, Detroit,
Minneapolis, Los Angeles and Honolulu.</P>
      <P>Several major US airlines have recently moved to increase their
service to Japan, taking advantage of a new aviation pact reached
between the United States and Japan on Jan. 30. Those airlines,
including Northwest, American Airlines, Delta and US Airways, will
expand the both number of flights between the US and Japan as well as
points beyond.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC, PHILIPPINE LEGISLATORS TO JOINTLY COMBAT REGIONAL CRIME</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  12  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Lawmakers from the Republic of China and
the Philippines will soon sign a memorandum on joint operations to
combat crime in the Asian-Pacific region.</P>
      <P>An interparty group from Taiwan's Legislative Yuan, to be headed
by Kuomintang Legislator Wang Ling-lin, is leaving for Manila on
Friday to sign the memorandum with its Filipino counterpart. It is
hoped that by forging the pact the two countries will redouble
efforts in eradicating cross-border crime as well as illegal
activities in areas beyond.</P>
      <P>At a press conference prior to the group's departure for Manila,
Wang, a chief executive of the ROC-RP Legislators' Association, said
the signing of the memorandum is aimed at initiating joint police
operations between the two countries and at making such cooperation a
regular and institutionalized program.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Wang made public a white paper on joint efforts to
crack down on crime between Taiwan and the Philippines.</P>
      <P>The report, co-authored by five professors from the National
Police Academy, said cross-border organized crime is posing new
threats to social security and compromising the national interests of
Asian Pacific countries. It concluded that law enforcement
cooperation between Taiwan and the Philippines will clearly reduce
such activity and help improve social order.</P>
      <P>The report added that although Taiwan and Philippine authorities
have cooperated on individual cases in the past, with more than 40
criminal suspects being exchanged between the two countries, some
issues remain difficult to tackle due to the absence of formal
diplomatic relations between Taipei and Manila.</P>
      <P>The white paper called for top law enforcement agencies of the
two countries to forge a treaty on collaborative action to combat
crime, institutionalize bilateral meeting forums and establish
channels for swapping case information and police files.</P>
      <P>In addition to signing the memorandum, Wang and 12 other
legislators, including Wang Tien-ging from the Kuomintang,
nonpartisan Chang Chin-cheng and the New Party's Chen Yi-hsin, will
also call at the Philippine House of Representatives, Ministry of
Justice and National Police Headquarters as well as meet with leaders
of the Taiwan business community in the Philippines for discussions.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FOREIGN INVESTMENTS IN TAIWAN STOCK MARKET SURGE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 12 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Prompted by an overall bullish sentiment in
Taiwan's stock market, hot money from foreign investors has continued
to pour in since the market reopened on Feb. 2 following the Chinese
New Year holiday.</P>
      <P>According to the latest Central Bank of China (CBC) statistics,
in the seven trading days from that time, the net inflow of foreign
funds for stock investment has reached US$691.63 million.</P>
      <P>The record influx marks a recovery of overseas confidence in the
local market which had been sagging since the outbreak of the Asian
regional financial crisis in the middle of last year, the CBC
indicated.</P>
      <P>From last May to this January, the statistics showed, the outflow
of foreign investment from the shares market had outpaced the influx
of overseas funds on a month-to-month basis, with the exception of
August and December.</P>
      <P>In 1997, the island's stock market suffered an overall decline of
more than US$1.07 billion in foreign investment, a direct result of
the Asian financial storm, the CBC figures showed.</P>
      <P>However, the return of outside funds as of the beginning of
February is heating up the market once again, the CBC pointed out. It
noted that from the first trading day following the Chinese New Year
holiday until this past Monday over US$843 million in foreign funds
were pumped into stock trading here, while only around US$151 billion
in overseas assets were transferred out of the local market during
the seven-day trading period.</P>
      <P>If the net volume of outside investment keeps its present pace,
February will see a new record, breaking the single-month high of
US$1.2 billion registered in December 1993, since Taiwan formally
opened the local stock market to foreign capital in 1991, the CBC
said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ECONOMIC OFFICIAL PREDICTS STABLE PRICES THIS YEAR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  12  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Recent declines in the global prices of
agriculture products and crude oil will help bring down the costs of
imported goods and also stabilize domestic prices, Yeh Ming-feng,
director of the Council for Economic Planning and Development's
Economic Research Department, said on Thursday.</P>
      <P>A more solid Taiwan dollar will also contribute to price
stability, Yeh said, noting that the real effective exchange rate
index of the Taiwan dollar was 91.33 in January, up 0.3 percent from
the previous month and continuing to rebound since late last
year.</P>
      <P>Yeh noted that the price of oil on global markets has shown a
modest decline in recent days because supplies are exceeding demands.
With the coming of spring and a steady supply of agricultural
products worldwide, farm commodity prices will be maintained while
the cost of imported goods will drop.</P>
      <P>The economics official also said the dramatic 23 percent decline
of Taiwan's trade volume in January was not attributable to any major
negative factor. Rather, it was the result of fewer working days in
January because of the Chinese New Year holidays as well as the
implementation of a five-day workweek starting Jan. 1.</P>
      <P>In addition, Southeast Asian nations have also tightened control
over the exodus of foreign currency in the wake of the financial
crisis that hit the region in mid-1997, which has also resulted in a
cut in Taiwan's trade surplus with those countries, Yeh added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SUHARTO SUSPECTS PLOT TO MAKE RUPIAH FALL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Jakarta, Feb. 11 (CNA)
(By Wu Pin Chiang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Indonesia's President Suharto on Wednesday
said that the downfall of the country's currency, the rupiah, has been
engineered by certain parties who want to destroy the nation.</P>
      <P>"If the exchange rate falls to 10,000 rupiah to one US dollar,
many companies would be ruined and compelled to lay off their
workers. Laid-off workers would then be easily stirred (into
rioting)," Antara news agency quoted the head of state as saying in
an impromptu speech after inaugurating the Texmaco industrial complex
in Subang district, West Java Province.</P>
      <P>Suharto said he suspects that there is a plot to destroy the
country's economic foundation by making the exchange rate fall to as
low as 20,000 rupiah to one dollar.</P>
      <P>It is not logical for the currency to fall by 1,000 to 2,000
rupiah within a single day, he said.</P>
      <P>He further said that irresponsible groups have also circulated
rumors on his health.</P>
      <P>"I have been reported to be dead, sick or paralyzed," he said
with a smile.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the rupiah opened stronger against the US dollar
during Wednesday's trading here in a continuing trend this week that
showed no trace of central bank intervention.</P>
      <P>The Indonesian currency opened at between 7,300 and 7,500 to the
dollar in Jakarta's interbank spot market.</P>
      <P>The rupiah on Tuesday strengthened by 2,200 points from Monday's
close of 9,600/9,750 to one dollar.</P>
      <P>"The selling action by market dealers continued from the morning
session to the closing hour. The currency kept strengthening until
the end of the session," APEC Research quoted a dealer as saying.</P>
      <P>The dealer said the strengthening of the rupiah followed
a positive sentiment that had developed among market dealers
following reports of government plans to peg the rupiah's exchange
rate to a certain level.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CANADIANS WANT SNOWBOARDER TO KEEP OLYMPIC MEDAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  Feb.  11  (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>While a Canadian athlete waited for an
appeal decision in Nagano, Japan, Canadians back home from the sports
minister and solicitor general down were throwing support behind
snowboarder Ross Rebagliati on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Most said he should keep his Olympic gold medal despite testing
positive for marijuana. And he remains a hometown hero in Whistler,
British Columbia, where a celebration party will be ready for him, no
matter what.</P>
      <P>Canadian parliamentarians of all stripes said the International
Olympic Committee has over-reacted to minute traces of marijuana
found in Rebagliati's test specimens after he won the first snowboard
gold ever awarded at the Winter Games. In a split decision, the IOC
stripped the 26-year-old of his medal, which he claimed he has worked
11 hard years to earn.</P>
      <P>"Based on the facts that have been communicated, I think the
young man was the best in the world and he did not engage in any
activity that would illegally enhance that," Heritage Minister Sheila
Copps said.</P>
      <P>Copps, whose portfolio covers sports, said, "Canadians are
rooting for him." Her comments echoed those of Andy Scott, who as
solicitor general is responsible for the Royal Canadian Mounted
Police, correctional services, the parole board and CSIS, or
intelligence service.</P>
      <P>"Every Canadian would love to see him have his medal," Scott said
following a Liberal Party caucus meeting.</P>
      <P>An independent, three-member tribunal in Nagano, is Rebagliati's
last chance of appeal. The panel is to rule Thursday on whether the
medal sanction stands.</P>
      <P>Reform MP John Reynolds, whose West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast
constituency includes Rebagliati's hometown, said the ruling reeks of
Olympic political infighting in which members vote in the interests
of their own country's medal standing.</P>
      <P>"My constituents and a lot of the professional ski people in
Whistler are very upset about this," said Reynolds. "They think it's
part of the old Olympic (political) game. There's a dispute inside
the Olympic group itself," he added.</P>
      <P>Conservative Party leader Jean Charest, who has previously served
as sports minister, said Rebagliati shouldn't see his gold go up in
smoke.</P>
      <P>"A warning would be sufficient," said Charest. "The public rebuke
is, in itself, a pretty severe penalty for a young man."</P>
      <P>It was the Tory cabinet which in 1988 clamped down a severe
punishment on Ben Johnson, who tested positive for steroid after
winning a world record-breaking gold medal in 100-meter sprint at the
Seoul Olympics.</P>
      <P>New Democratic Party Leader Alexa McDonough said it is clear that
marijuana is not a performance-enhancing drug, and believes the IOC
has overstepped its bounds.</P>
      <P>"They're supposed to be there to deal with cheaters, not to rule
on the morality of individual athletes," said McDonough. "Whatever
this guy may have been guilty of, I don't think it's cheating."</P>

    <HEADLINE>AUSTRALIAN CITY REJECTS PROTESTS OVER DISPLAY OF ROC NAME</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra, Feb. 12 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A serious dispute has flared anew between
Fairfield City and the mainland Chinese Consulate General in Sydney
and pro-Beijing Chinese migrants over the arch hanging in a landmark
square of the city because it contains the wording "Republic of
China."</P>
      <P>Less than three years ago, the mainland Chinese consulate general
and its supporters lodged a strong protest when Fairfield, 30
kilometers west of Sydney, signed a sisterhood agreement with Hsinchu
City in Taiwan because the agreement contained reference to the
Republic of China.</P>
      <P>The first dispute was brought to the Australian federal
government which told Beijing diplomats that Canberra has no
jurisdiction over such matters involving small cities or local
governments, including Fairfield.</P>
      <P>The latest dispute followed the protests by the mainland's
consulate general in Sydney and pro-Beijing Chinese associations,
including the Australian Chinese Descendant Mutual Association
(ACDMA).</P>
      <P>Consulate officials made a phone call to the Fairfield,
expressing concern and protest over the city's permission to use the
wording "Republic of China" on the arch, while the ACDMA and other
associations sent a joint letter to the city demanding that the ROC
reference be removed from the arch because it would cause diplomatic
row between Australia and mainland China.</P>
      <P>The Fairfield municipal authorities agreed to blacken out the
wording in question. But the ROC name was restored after a request by
a pro-Taiwan organization whose members are mainly overseas Chinese
migrants from Indochina.</P>
      <P>The organization's leader, Tiao Chen-mao, argued that they had
the right to display any title, including the ROC name, because they
had donated the money to build the arch.</P>
      <P>Tiao said the reference to the ROC is not an offense to Australia
because Australia is a democratic country.</P>
      <P>He also expressed surprise at the protest from the mainland
Chinese consulate general because Beijing always asks foreign
countries not to interfere with its internal affairs.</P>
      <P>Tiao said Fairfield is a small city with a population of 170,000
and not a major city like Sydney.</P>
      <P>But ACDMA and other protesters said Australia adopts a "one
China" policy and the use of the ROC name would damage bilateral ties
between Australia and mainland China.</P>
      <P>In a response to the protests from the mainland Chinese consulate
general and pro-Beijing Chinese associations, the Fairfield City
Council early this week held an emergency meeting to discuss the
issue and later voted nine to five to maintain the wording, stating
that the ROC was founded by the late Dr. Sun Yat-sen, who advocated
democracy and freedom for all Chinese people when he established the
republic.</P>
      <P>Members of the city council who voted to maintain the wording
said those Indochinese migrants who donated money to build the arch
are people who have sought freedom and democracy in Australia.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SINGAPORE MANUFACTURERS SEE NO CHANGE IN BUSINESS CLIMATE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  Feb.  12 (CNA)
(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Most manufacturers in Singapore do not
expect business conditions in the first half of this year to worsen
despite the Asian financial turmoil, according to the latest
quarterly survey by the Singapore Economic Development Board (EDB).</P>
      <P>But, a separate survey by the Singapore Department of Statistics
(DOS) shows that the commerce sector is bracing itself for a business
slowdown.</P>
      <P>In the EDB survey, "Business Expectations of the Manufacturing
Sector" conducted between last December and January this year, 384
companies were approached, with 94 percent of them responding.</P>
      <P>Fifty-five percent of the industrialists surveyed expected
business conditions to remain the same, while 29 percent predicted a
weakening. Only 16 percent saw an improvement ahead.</P>
      <P>"The caution is largely due to the anticipation of softer
overseas demand, especially from the region," the EDB said.</P>
      <P>The EDB's business expectation surveys are considered
forward-looking indicators relating to the health of the economy.</P>
      <P>However, expectations varied from industry to industry within the
manufacturing sector. For example, businessmen in the electronics
industry -- the central pillar of the manufacturing sector -- varied
in their outlook for the six months ending in June.</P>
      <P>Manufacturers in the computer, computer peripherals and
telecommunications sectors expected more export orders, while
semiconductor manufacturers were more conservative because of falling
prices of dynamic random access memory chips.</P>
      <P>Disk drive makers gave mixed views, with some anticipating good
orders and others expecting to be affected by global overcapacity.</P>
      <P>In other industries, such as marine products, petroleum refining
and pharmaceuticals, most expected business to remain unchanged in
the first half of the year.</P>
      <P>The transport equipment industry anticipated an improvement,
which would be led mainly by the aviation sector, thanks to firm
demand for aircraft maintenance.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding the cautious mood, manufacturers said they would
continue to invest in plants, machinery and buildings over the next
12 months.</P>
      <P>But they will watch out for competitive prices from overseas
competitors, which remains the most crucial factor in getting more
export orders in the first quarter.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, wholesalers and retailers in Singapore expect lower
sales between January and June, according to the DOS Business
Expectations Survey conducted last December.</P>
      <P>Companies engaged in transport and storage as well as real estate
services also predicted a downturn.</P>
      <P>Most financial institutions forecast a downward trend.</P>
      <P>But catering establishments and hoteliers, which saw higher
earnings thanks to the yearend festive season, were optimistic about
their businesses in the new year, the DOS said.</P>

      <P>The ruling Golkar decided to nominate H.
Harmoko and B.J. Habibie for the vice presidency for the 1998-2003
term at its plenary meeting in Jakarta on Wednesday night.</P>
      <P>"The Golkar's plenary meeting has decided to nominate Bung
Harmoko and Prof. B.J. Habibie (for the vice presidency)," Golkar
spokesman Abdul Gafur was quoted by Antara news agency as saying
following the meeting.</P>
      <P>The plenary meeting, which took place at the Golkar head office
here, lasted for nearly two hours.</P>
      <P>Gafur, who is also Golkar executive board leader, said the party
would soon put forward the name of its vice presidential candidate
for discussion at the forum of the Golkar big family.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a senior military officer said in a meeting in Kopo,
West Java, Wednesday that the armed forces (ABRI) do not want to make
another mistake by announcing its vice presidential nominee before
the general session of the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR) in
March.</P>
      <P>"The ABRI does not want to repeat the past event," the ABRI head
for social and political affairs, Lt. Gen. Yunus Yosfiah, told
participants of the Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI) meeting in
Kopo.</P>
      <P>In 1993, the then ABRI head for social and political affairs, Lt.
Gen. Hersudino Hartas, nominated the then ABRI Chief Gen. Try
Sutrisno for the vice presidency in the lead-up to the MPR general
session.</P>
      <P>Yosfiah said the ABRI wanted to go through a constitutional
mechanism in nominating its vice presidential candidate.</P>
      <P>Under the 1945 Constitution, the choice of vice presidential
candidate shall be discussed with the president-elect so that they
can cooperate.</P>
      <P>If the ABRI announces its vice presidential candidate ahead of
the MPR session, it would appear as if it was steering public
attention to the candidate.</P>
      <P>"We don't want to dictate to the public," Yosfiah said.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  12  (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Lien Chan has received an
invitation from Malaysia's Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad to visit
that country at a convenient time, sources close to Lien said on
Thursday.</P>
      <P>According to the sources, Mahathir's invitation was extended to
Lien on Wednesday by Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim,
who left Taiwan for home Thursday morning after a whirlwind overnight
visit to the island.</P>
      <P>The sources said Anwar talked with Lien by telephone Wednesday
night as the vice president was on a grassroots community outreach
tour in southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>During their 30-minute conversation, Anwar was quoted as telling
Lien that he admires the Republic of China government's achievements
in keeping Taiwan largely unscathed by Asia's regionwide financial
turmoil, which has battered several Asia-Pacific countries since last
summer.</P>
      <P>Anwar, widely regarded as heir apparent to Mahathir, also told
Lien that he looks forward to visiting Taiwan again in the near
future to look into the development of biotechnology and other
high-tech industries here.</P>
      <P>For his part, Lien promised to accompany Anwar on a tour of
Taiwan's high-tech stronghold -- the Hsinchu Science-based Industrial
Park -- during his next trip to the island.</P>
      <P>Lien further indicated that he may visit Malaysia later this
year. Anwar is an old friend of Lien, who visited Malaysia in 1993

    <HEADLINE>KMT BRASSHAT CALLS BEIJING INTERFERENCE 'IRRATIONAL'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Seoul,  Feb.  12  (CNA)
(By Y.C. Chiang &amp; Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>John Chang, secretary-general of the
Republic of China's ruling Kuomintang (KMT), on Thursday lashed out
at Beijing's request for South Korea to reject economic aid from
Taiwan at a time of obvious financial difficulty, calling it
politically "irrational."</P>
      <P>Chang, who is currently on a four-day private visit in South
Korea, noted that, as a sovereign country, South Korea makes its own
policy decisions based on considerations of national interest. Its
choices can by no means be interfered with by any foreign government,
Chang stressed.</P>
      <P>Chang made the remarks in response to a Korean newspaper report
filed from Beijing which stated that mainland Chinese President Jiang
Zemin met Kim Jong-pil, the leader of the Korean United Liberal
Democrats in Beijing last Sunday. During their meeting, Jiang
reportedly expressed hope that Seoul would not accept an offer of
financial aid from Taiwan aimed at helping South Korea tide over its
economic crisis.</P>
      <P>The report also said that in the meeting with Kim, who will
become South Korea's prime minister after President-elect Kim
Dae-jung takes office on Feb. 25, Jiang asked the incoming South
Korean administration to stay firm in its promise to recognize
Beijing's "one China" policy. Kim, in return, promised that future
Seoul-Taipei relations will remain private and unofficial, the report
said.</P>
      <P>It quoted mainland Chinese authorities as claiming that Taiwan,
in a money-diplomacy foray, is seeking to expand its political clout
with hard currency, implying that Taiwan's offer of cash loans to
South Korea exceeds the bounds of private exchanges.</P>
      <P>Chang stressed that his visit here is aimed at gauging South
Korea's attitude and its sincerity in improving bilateral ties with
Taiwan. Although the two countries maintain no formal diplomatic
relations, he said, Taiwan, as a neighbor which is relatively
unscathed by the current Asian economic turmoil, is willing to help
bail out South Korea from its difficulties.</P>
      <P>Chang, who arrived in Seoul on Wednesday, met with KMT officials
based in Seoul and overseas Chinese leaders in South Korea on
Thursday to convey KMT Chairman Lee Teng-hui's greetings to ROC
supporters in that country, and exchanged views with them on a wide
range of topics.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOFA OFFERS AID FOR EXPORT INSURANCE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 12 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>In light of the sharp downturn in Taiwan's
exports to much of the rest of Asia in recent months, the government
has decided to aid local exporters trading with nations in the region
through an incentive insurance arrangement.</P>
      <P>Economics Minister Wang Chih-kang revealed on Wednesday that his
ministry will inject NT$60 million (US$1.82 million) into the ROC
Export-Import Bank, allowing it to offer export insurance services to
local businessmen trading with Southeast Asian nations and South
Korea, which have been suffering tremendous currency woes since the
outbreak of the regional financial crisis.</P>
      <P>The decline in trade to those countries, which have little
foreign currency and have seen their own units depreciate
drastically, has affected Taiwan trade businesses, which have slowed
their sales in the region to avoid losses from bounced checks or
failed letters of credit.</P>
      <P>Wang said the money is expected to provide an entire credit range
of approximately NT$1 billion to exporters who wish to reduce their
risk in selling goods to those countries, including Thailand,
Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines and South Korea.</P>
      <P>Between the time the financial storm began in the middle of last
year and December, Taiwan exports to South Korea fell 30 percent,
followed by a 22 percent plunge in Taiwan goods to Thailand, a 14
percent drop to Indonesia and a 4 percent slide to Malaysia,
according to statistics from the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOFA).</P>

    <HEADLINE>M'LAND DEMOCRATIC FACTION PROPOSES TO RECOGNIZE ROC'S SOVEREIGNTY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Tokyo, Feb. 12 (CNA)
(By Victor Lai and Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A democratic faction in the Chinese mainland
is preparing to submit a proposal for recognizing the sovereignty of
the Republic of China in Taiwan to the National People's Congress of
mainland China, which opens March 5, according to a report in
Thursday's edition of Yomiuri Shimbun in Tokyo.</P>
      <P>The democratic faction will urge the Beijing authorities to
consider the implementation of direct elections in districts on and
above the prefectural level, to permit private enterprises to run
media operations such as newspapers and TV stations, and to engage in
political negotiations with Taipei on an equal basis, the daily said,
citing a copy of the proposal it obtained.</P>
      <P>In view of mainland China's current monolithic political system,
however, the Beijing authorities are unlikely to adopt the proposal,
the daily noted.</P>
      <P>The proposal, titled "China Must Be Transformed -- Opinions of
the Democratic Faction," contains sections pertaining to politics,
the economy, foreign affairs, culture and the reunification of the
two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The proposal was written by Fang Jue, 43, a graduate of Beijing
University, who was a staff member of the Institute of Political
Science of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and worked under
Yen Jiachi, who later on became a theoretician in mainland Chinese
democratic movement. Members of the Chinese Communist Party in both
the central and local governments also took part in the document's
preparation, the news report said.</P>
      <P>Concerning the Taiwan issue, the proposal deems that the central
governments in Beijing and Taipei are of equal status according to
international law. It also declares that Beijing should respect the
choice of Taiwan residents, renounce the use of force against the
island and proceed with political negotiations with Taipei on an
equal basis.</P>
      <P>In regard to the issue of Tibet, Beijing should offer the region
adequate self-rule, allow the Tibetans to select directly their own
administrators, the proposal says, adding that it would be better for
the Beijing authorities to discuss the matter with the Dalai Lama.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN, MAINLAND SHIPPERS MEET IN BANGKOK</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 12 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Shipping tycoons from the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait are quietly meeting in Bangkok to discuss some
practical issues concerning cross-strait shipping services, sources
close to the Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC)
reported on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Shieh Ming-hui, director of the MOTC's Navigation Department,
and his mainland Chinese counterpart, Hu Hanxiang, are also
attending the meeting as senior advisers to the Taipei-based Taiwan
Strait Shipping Association and the Beijing-based Association for
Shipping Across the Taiwan Strait, respectively, the sources said.</P>
      <P>Shieh is expected to make a public report on the outcome of the
Bangkok conference after he returns to Taipei on Friday, the sources
said.</P>
      <P>The meeting between senior executives from the two private
shipping associations on both sides of the Taiwan Strait was
originally scheduled to be held in Hong Kong before the Chinese
New Year holiday. The two sides later decided to change the
venue to Bangkok because Hong Kong is now under mainland
China's rule.</P>
      <P>Major topics to be discussed at the meeting include
issues related to operations of the offshore cross-strait
transshipping services and other practical cross-strait shipping
problems, the sources said.</P>
      <P>Local shipping companies have complained that mainland China has
delayed in allowing major Taiwan shipping firms like Yangming Marine
Transport Corp., Uniglory Marine Corp. and Evergreen Marine Corp. to
operate scheduled cross-strait shipping services.</P>
      <P>"We hope mainland delegates will explain why mainland
authorities would not issue operating permits to the three Taiwan
firms," an MOTC official said, adding that Taiwan hopes mainland
authorities will make public their screening principles.</P>
      <P>In addition, the official said, Taiwan delegates will urge
mainland China to open more mainland ports for offshore direct
cross-strait transshipping services.</P>
      <P>Mainland China has only opened two relatively small ports --
Fuzhou and Xiamen -- in its southeastern Fujian Province for
direct cross-strait transshipping services. Local shippers have long
urged mainland authorities to open its major ports, such as
Guangzhou, Shanghai, Dalien, Qingdao and Tianjin, for such services
to help increase their shipping volume.</P>
      <P>Taiwan still bans direct cross-strait shipping services. All
commercial ships are required to make a stopover at a third place
before coming to Taiwan from the mainland or vice versa.
Nevertheless, Taiwan has opened its Kaohsiung Harbor for offshore
direct cross-strait transshipping services, under which mainland
goods can be transported to third places via Kaohsiung and vice
versa.</P>
      <P>In an attempt to pressure Taiwan to open full-fledged direct
cross-strait shipping services, mainland China has imposed strict
restrictions on offshore cross-strait transshipping services.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, mainland delegates reportedly will ask their Taiwan
counterparts to explain Taiwan's regulations governing
foreign-registered mainland vessels operating shipping services
across the Taiwan Strait via a third place.</P>
      <P>The Beijing-based China Ocean Shipping Co. (COSCO) has filed an
application with the Kaohsiung Harbor Bureau for operating the
Kaohsiung-Hong Kong-Shekou-Japan-US West Coast shipping route. The
Kaohsiung Harbor Bureau has not approved the application because
Taiwan still bans mainland-registered ships from entering its ports.
The mainland company must file its application in the name of its
Hong Kong affiliate, MOTC officials said.</P>
      <P>Local press reports said Taiwan may approve COSCO's application
in exchange for Beijing's early permission of three Taiwan firms --
Yangming, Uniglory and Evergreen -- to operate cross-strait
transshipping services. But the premise is that the mainland firm
files its application through its Hong Kong affiliate.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AIDS-INFECTED HEMOPHILIACS ASK FOR NATIONAL COMPENSATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  12  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of local hemophiliacs who have
contracted the deadly AIDS virus from injections of contaminated
blood products filed applications with the Department of Health (DOH)
on Thursday for national compensation.</P>
      <P>The victims demanded that the government compensate each of them
NT$8 million (US$244,648) for its negligence in handling the case.
They blamed National Taiwan University Hospital's hemophilic center
for failing to inform them of their infection of the AIDS virus in
time and the DOH for delaying in taking precautionary measures.</P>
      <P>A total of 53 local hemophiliacs contracted the virus after
receiving injections of contaminated Factor Eight blood products
between 1983 and 1985. Twenty-two of them already died of the deadly
disease.</P>
      <P>American authorities in 1983 ordered that all blood products
should be heat-treated immediately after encountering the first case
of a hemophilia patient becoming infected with AIDS from an
injection of blood products. However, the DOH failed to comply with
the directive until 1985. The two-year time lapse ultimately
victimized the 53 local hemophiliacs.</P>
      <P>The victims have decided to ask for national compensation after
a major foreign supplier of the contaminated blood products agreed to
compensate each of them only NT$1.2 million (US$36,697), far lower
than the DOH-proposed NT$2 million.</P>
      <P>Most of the tainted blood products were imported from Germany's
Bayer Co. A Bayer spokesman said the NT$1.2 million damage award is
caculated in accordance with German standards. Some of the
contaminated products were supplied by another foreign firm.</P>
      <P>Legislator Yeh Chu-lan said the compensation offered by Bayer
was too low compared with an equivalent to NT$12 million offered in
Japan for similar cases, or US$100,000 in the United States and
100,000 sterling pond in Britain.</P>
      <P>DOH officials said late last year the department would help
local hemophiliacs negotiate with Bayer for compensating each victim
at least NT$2 million.</P>
      <P>As the negotiations failed to produce favorable results, the DOH
said on Thursday it will consider filing lawsuits against the foreign
suppliers of the tainted blood products on behalf of the victims. It
also promised to exempt the surviving victims from paying any
premium under the National Health Insurance Program and to offer
them other services and assistance.</P>
      <P>As legal procedures take much time to complete, some observers
said the DOH should first offer a sum of money to each victim and
then seek compensations from foreign blood products manufacturers.</P>
      <P>Legal experts also said it remains uncertain whether the
AIDS-contracted hemophiliacs can succeed in obtaining national
compensation. They suggested that the victims negotiate with
relevant government agencies before seeking compensation through
legal procedures.</P>

    <DATELINE>San  Francisco,  Feb.  12  (CNA)
(By Neil Lu and Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A prominent mainland Chinese
dissident exiled in the United States predicted on Wednesday that a
popular revolution will take place in mainland China soon and that an
opposition party formed by mainland dissidents scattered around the
world will emerge there.</P>
      <P>Wang Bingzhang described the Chinese Communist Party as a "big
pus-filled boil," and said a revolution led by the people of the
mainland will soon break out there. The future leadership of mainland
China will not be the communist party or the Republic of China's
ruling Kuomintang, but an opposition party composed of mainland
democracy activists now living throughout the world, he added.</P>
      <P>Wang made the remarks at a news conference in Oakland,
California, after arriving from Shanghai via Los Angeles.</P>
      <P>Wang, 50, a noted dissident who founded the pro-democracy
publication "China Spring" and lives in exile in the US, sneaked into
mainland China on Jan. 23 under an assumed name. He was expelled by
mainland authorities on Monday after being caught in central Anhui
province last Friday.</P>
      <P>The purpose of his return to mainland China was aimed at forming
an opposition political party, he said, adding that most mainland
Chinese people only know life under the communist party and that it
is very important to forge a new political force there.</P>
      <P>Wang said he was able to complete six or seven mission objectives
during his mainland visit.</P>
      <P>He called on all mainland dissidents residing overseas to work
hand-in-hand with democratic forces in the mainland and to provide
their mainland counterparts with financial support, warning that
otherwise, mainland China's pro-democracy groups based overseas will
lose their links with mainland democratic forces at home.</P>
      <P>Wang also strongly criticized mainland China's human rights
abuses, claiming that his arrest and swift release by mainland
authorities was without any legal basis.</P>

(By Mike Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Japan Times, the largest
English-language newspaper in Japan, published a six-page special
report Thursday on Taiwan's economic development</P>
      <P>The report, titled "World Eye Report on Taiwan: Little Island,
Big Future," was the fruit of 14 weeks of coverage in Taiwan,
beginning early last September, by two Japan Times reporters.</P>
      <P>The report features interviews with Chiang Pin-kung, chairman of
the Republic of China's Council for Economic Planning and
Development, and 18 leaders in Taiwan's economic, financial and
insurance sectors.</P>
      <P>Chiang told the Times that the Southeast Asian currency crisis
has had only a limited effect on Taiwan's economy because Taiwan's
economic fundamentals are sound, with the world's third-largest
foreign reserves and an economic growth rate of about 6.6 percent,
the highest among Asia's four "tigers."</P>
      <P>Asked about Taiwan's primary economic strengths, Chiang
elaborated on four major points: the island's superior geographic
location, wealth of human resources, steady and substantial economic
growth, and strong industrial foundation and vigorous
entrepreneurship.</P>
      <P>Referring to Taiwan's weaker areas affecting its economy, Chiang
also cited four points: insufficient liberalization and
internationalization, insufficient infrastructure and low efficiency
of resource allocations, a labor shortage, and low government
efficiency.</P>
      <P>He noted the ROC government has launched an initiative to promote
national development into the next century and enhance the nation's
competitiveness.</P>
      <P>The plan to develop Taiwan as an Asia-Pacific regional operations
center is very important, Chiang stressed. The plan involves setting
up six specialized operations centers with the ultimate goal of
developing Taiwan into a "science and technology island" and
upgrading its international competitiveness, he added.</P>
      <P>Also among those interviewed in the special report are George
Hsu, president of Evergreen Marine Corp. (Taiwan); Ming Chien,
chairman of First International Computer; Michael McKelvie, president
of Ford Lio Ho Motor Co.; and Lee Wen-hsiung, chairman of the Taiwan

    <HEADLINE>SEVERAL COUNTRIES STUDYING S'PORE'S AID-INDONESIA PROPOSAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  Feb.  12 (CNA)
(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A proposal by Singapore Prime Minister
Goh Chok Tong to establish a multilateral scheme to kick-start the
Indonesian economy through its importers and exporters is being
studied by several countries, The Straits Times reported Thursday in
a dispatch from Jakarta.</P>
      <P>Demonstrating its commitment, the Singapore government has
pledged a maximum of US$2.5 billion to underwrite an Indonesian trade
finance guarantee facility, according to a proposal paper obtained by
The Straits Times.</P>
      <P>The Singapore money would come from the US$5 billion it has
already offered Jakarta under a US$43 billion aid package supervised
by the International Monetary Fund.</P>
      <P>The paper -- written by the Indonesia country manager of the
ABN-AMRO Bank of the Netherlands, C.J. de Koning, in consultation
with the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) -- was sent to several
governments last Saturday, sources said.</P>
      <P>The recipient countries included Indonesia's major trading
partners -- Japan, the United States, Australia and Canada, the
report said.</P>
      <P>The Dutch government is considering joining the proposed Group of
Governments being assembled by Singapore to underwrite the scheme.
Its proposed maximum contribution is US$1 billion.</P>
      <P>When Goh announced the initiative in Jakarta last week after
meeting Indonesian President Suharto, he said the scheme could
provide the Indonesian central bank with up to US$20 billion in
foreign counter guarantees to "unlock" its stalled international
trade.</P>
      <P>With the rupiah's plunge in recent months, international banks
have stopped lending to Indonesian banks, making it hard for
Indonesian exporters to find foreign banks that would honor their
letters of credit from local banks.</P>
      <P>Singapore will put forward a plan for Suharto's approval as soon
as possible, Goh said, noting it could take some weeks to bring more
countries on board.</P>
      <P>Sources said Goh met de Koning, a veteran banker with many years'
experience in Indonesia who had floated the idea, before meeting
Suharto last Tuesday, according to the report.</P>
      <P>The Dutch banker, described by an associate as someone who "loves
putting together rescue packages," flew into Singapore for
consultations with the MAS the next day, the report said.</P>
      <P>In a 10-page proposal paper dated Feb. 6, de Koning outlines an
implementation plan that offers the required foreign guarantees while
offering the underwriting governments some protection:</P>
      <P>-- Bank Indonesia (BI) would select 15-20 banks in which requests
for opening letters of credit (LCs) as well as pre-export financing
would be concentrated until the "current crisis situation is

premium of 0.25 percent per transaction, to be paid by participating
banks every quarter to a private clearing corporation to be set up.</P>
      <P>-- BI would also have to open special International Trade Finance
Accounts in US dollars and other convertible currencies with several
foreign banks. Foreign governments would have the highest priority to
proceeds in the event of defaults.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PROTESTERS CLASH WITH POLICE IN JAKARTA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Jakarta,  Feb.  12  (CNA)
(By Wu Pin-chiang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>At least 150 people, including 14 women
and two children, were apprehended during a demonstration Wednesday
over soaring prices and taken to Jakarta Police headquarters.</P>
      <P>They were among 500 protesters who marched to the Attorney
General's Office before heading to the Ministry of Manpower, both in
South Jakarta.</P>
      <P>The protesters, who called themselves the Red and White National
Front, arrived at noon in minibuses and other forms of public
transportation,</P>
      <P>They demanded the Attorney General's Office take proactive
measures to follow up on what the group called mismanagement and
misconduct among government officials.</P>
      <P>A few representatives were ushered into the ministry's office,
but hundreds of police and military troops foiled the attempts of
other protesters to reach the office, closing the complex's front
gate. Some protesters also clashed with police prior to reaching the
office.</P>
      <P>They were later taken to Jakarta Police headquarters for
questioning.</P>
      <P>The protesters, believed to be supporters of the ousted leader of
the Indonesian Democratic Party, Megawati Soekarnoputri, held a
demonstration in front of the central bank building in Central
Jakarta on Monday.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, college students in North Sumatra and Central Sulawesi
staged massive demonstrations Wednesday demanding the government do
more to bring down prices of basic goods.</P>
      <P>In Central Sulawesi, hundreds of students took to the streets of
the capital Palu, carrying posters and chanting slogans demanding
prices be lowered.</P>
      <P>They marched to the provincial legislative council offices, where
they read out their demands, the Antara news agency reported.</P>
      <P>The demonstration prompted many shops in the city to close
Wednesday because the owners were worried the protest would turn
violent.</P>
      <P>In Medan, the capital of North Sumatra, a similar protest took
place at the Sumatra Utara University campus.</P>
      <P>The students included political reform, abolition of the
subversive law, the election of a new president and action against
corrupt bureaucrats in their demands.</P>
      <P>Demands for lower prices was also the theme of activists at
Yogyakarta's Indonesian Islamic University. They urged Armed Forces
Commander Gen. Feisal Tanjung to take punitive measures against
people hoarding basic commodities.</P>
      <P>Business activities in the East Nusa Tenggara town of Ende slowly
resumed, although many ethnic Chinese traders who lost their property
in Sunday's riot remained in hiding Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Police have detained three people on charges of instigating the
riot Sunday in which 21 shops were burned to the ground and 71 others
damaged. Most of the affected premises were owned by entrepreneurs of
Chinese descent.</P>
      <P>Lay Ming, 46, who lost her shop and everything else except the
clothing she was wearing, called on the authorities to investigate
the incident. She said she believed the cause was "more than just the
rising prices."</P>

      <P>A Taiwan ship's captain and his 27 crewmen,
accused of illegal fishing in Somali waters in the Indian Ocean, will
face trial by a Somali Islamic court next week, the Republic of China
Foreign Ministry said on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Foreign Ministry spokesman Roy Wu said that the vessel's

      <P>On Wednesday, AFP reported that the trial will be conducted by a

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 12 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The seminar that the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party will open Friday on the party's policy on mainland
China is attracting widespread interest both here and abroad,
political analysts said here Thursday.</P>
      <P>The seminar will provide a forum for an open and unprecedented
debate on the question of cross-strait relations, they said.</P>
      <P>During the three-day seminar, participants will focus on three
main themes: the impact of the post-Cold War new world order on
Taiwan-mainland China relations, strategic planning for consultations
and interaction across the Taiwan Strait, and the development of
cross-strait trade and possible changes after both sides formally
enter the World Trade Organization.</P>
      <P>The participants can be divided roughly into two camps. Hsu
Hsing-liang, DPP chairman and the head of the party's Formosa
faction, will advocate a "westward expedition," meaning a more daring
attitude toward trade with mainland China.</P>
      <P>Another group, the non-Formosa faction, will advocate a gradual
approach toward the mainland, similar to the government's "no haste,
be patient" policy.</P>
      <P>The DPP has often been criticized for lacking a clear-cut,
concrete policy toward mainland China. Moreover, major DPP factions
are far apart on a number of mainland-related issues, including
whether the two sides should hold political talks or establish direct
trade, transport and postal links, commonly known as the "three
links."</P>
      <P>In the wake of its landslide win in last November's mayoral and
county magistrate elections, the DPP's prospects for becoming
Taiwan's ruling party have improved. To prove that the DPP is capable
of being a ruling party, participants in the seminar will inevitably
debate the biggest issue Taiwan faces today: cross-strait relations.</P>

      <P>Visiting Guinea Bissau Prime Minister
Carlos Augusto Correia met with Republic of China President Lee
Teng-hui on Thursday, the third day of his five-day official visit.</P>
      <P>Lee welcomed Correia and his entourage, and said he hoped his
visit, as well as the cooperation between the two countries, will
further consolidate bilateral ties.</P>
      <P>Lee told Correia that he is always interested in the development
of the ROC's allies, saying that whenever he makes overseas trips, he
takes pains to understand the host country's situation through
on-site inspections, and then initiates cooperation proposals based
on his observations.</P>
      <P>Only in this way can the purpose of his overseas trips be fully
realized, the president said.</P>
      <P>Noting that long-lasting bilateral ties should be based on mutual
benefit and prosperity, Lee promised to provide Guinea Bissau with
aid, and to encourage Taiwan business people to invest there.</P>
      <P>Correia, who is visiting Taiwan for the first time, thanked Lee
for the warm reception and praised Taiwan's marvelous achievements,
both economic and democratic.</P>
      <P>After nearly two decades of struggle for full independence,
Correia said that Guinea Bissau now devotes most of its efforts to
developing its agriculture while stabilizing its political situation.</P>
      <P>In order to attract foreign investment, Correia said, Guinea
Bissau has promulgated a set of rules which grant favorable treatment
to foreign investors. He welcomed Taiwan businesses wishing to

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN PEOPLE WANT A CAUTIOUS DPP MAINLAND POLICY: POLL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  12  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Most of the people of Taiwan expect the
opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) to adopt a cautious
stance when forging its own policy toward dealing with mainland
China, the results of a survey made public on Thursday indicate.</P>
      <P>The poll carried out by the mass-circulation China Times daily
newspaper shows that 51 percent of the respondents hope the
pro-independence DPP will be careful when working out its mainland
policy and that the party will adopt a softer and less
confrontational position on the issue, compared with 14 percent who
voiced support for a stronger stance against mainland China.</P>
      <P>The DPP is gearing up for another victorious showing in year-end
legislative elections following its resounding win in last year's
elections for provincial-level county magistrates and city mayors.
However, a daring "go west" mainland policy advocating closer
mainland ties which was raised recently by DPP Chairman Hsu
Hsin-liang has provoked heated debate among the different factions
within the party.</P>
      <P>The DPP is scheduled to hold a seminar on Friday to discuss its
approach towards mainland China.</P>
      <P>Although the DPP's victory in last year's local elections boosted
its hopes of becoming the ruling party in the near future, only 26
percent of those polled were aware that the party will debate the
stance and course of its mainland policy on Friday, while 43 percent
said they knew nothing about such a debate, according to the survey.</P>
      <P>When asked about whether they have confidence in the island's
leading opposition party if it gains the majority in the legislature,
27 percent said they are worried about such a result, while 27
percent said it makes no difference to them and 19 percent said they
would welcome such a development.</P>
      <P>According to the survey, the prime reason behind the public's
worry about the DPP's ability as a ruling party centers around its
ambiguous mainland policy and its pursuit of Taiwan independence.</P>
      <P>The survey found that 42 percent of the respondents are concerned
that the DPP's pro-independence stance will irritate the Chinese
communists, while 26 percent said they think the DPP lacks the
experience to be Taiwan's ruling party. Some 9 percent said they
think the DPP lacks the talent to rule the country, while 1 percent
said they fear the DPP will stir up ethnic confrontation and is a
violence-prone party.</P>
      <P>On future relations between Taiwan and mainland China, 45 percent
are in favor of maintaining the status-quo and about 19 percent hope
for eventual unification with the mainland, in contrast to 12 percent
who wish independence for the island.</P>
      <P>The telephone survey was conducted on Tuesday, sampling 777
people islandwide, with a margin of error of plus or minus 3.6
percentage points.</P>

    <HEADLINE>THUMBS-UP FOR BAYER'S SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL EFFORTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  12  (CNA)
(By Lin Wen-fen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A fact-finding delegation that recently
returned from a visit to the headquarters of the chemical giant Bayer
in Dormagen, Germany, on Thursday gave a thumbs-up to the efforts
made by the company in implementing measures for industrial safety
and environmental protection.</P>
      <P>Lin Ming-lin, speaker of the Taichung County Council, said at a
press conference attended by eight members of the delegation that
they were impressed by the well-managed Bayer factory, adding that
the visit has given them a really deep understanding of how Germany
endeavors to upgrade industrial safety and environmental protection
regulations.</P>
      <P>Lin said that he and several other county councilors who were
also part of the government-led delegation, made the most of the
five-day visit to learn about the safety precautions and operations
in the chemical plant because they wish to find out the best options
for Taichung County, where Bayer has proposed to build a plant for
the production of toluene di-isocyanate (TDI).</P>
      <P>Saying he hopes the first-hand and detailed information the
delegation brought back from Germany can serve as a reference for
Taichung County to decide if it wants the investment project, Lin
called on the residents of the Taichung Harbor area to focus on the
issues of industrial safety and environmental protection. They should
equip themselves with a better understanding of the project before
voicing their support or opposition, Lin said.</P>
      <P>He also called on the central government and the Bayer Group to
be more patient, adding that they should open more channels of
communication to give the residents of Taichung Harbor a better
understanding of the investment project.</P>
      <P>The fact-finding delegation, composed of more than 30 local
opinion leaders, academics and government officials, was led by Y.S.
Liu, vice chairman of the Cabinet-level Council for Economic Planning
and Development. They left for Germany on Feb. 4 and returned to
Taiwan on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>During the visit, Bayer representatives told the delegation that
the company might change its mind and continue with the investment
project in Taichung Harbor if the Taiwan Provincial Assembly approves
the land lease contract for Bayer by the end of this month. Bayer in
December announced it was suspending its first investment project in
Taiwan in the face of strong objections from local residents.</P>
      <P>As part of efforts to win the support and trust of the residents
of Taichung Harbor, the company also made several pledges to local
communities if the project is allowed to go ahead, among which are
promises to employ local people, to ensure that Bayer executives will
live inside the harbor area close to the plant and to ensure the
production facilities are built in accordance with German parent
company regulations.</P>

      <P>The Australian Trade Council (Austrade)
is seeking to establish a A$20 million venture capital fund to help
Australian investors cash in on bargain-priced Korean assets in the
wake of the recent financial crisis.</P>
      <P>Austrade officials said it is good timing to invest in strategic
industries in Korea so that Australian companies can buy the Korean
companies at cheaper prices and penetrate the Korean market.</P>
      <P>They said investment in Taiwan and Hong Kong is also good because
Taiwan remains buoyant and Hong Kong is on the rebound following the
Asian currency crisis.</P>
      <P>But they cautioned against investment in mainland China, saying,
"We are waiting to see what medium-term effects the crisis will have
on China."</P>
      <P>They also said the time is not yet ripe for investing in
Indonesia and Thailand because recovery will be slow and further
economic turmoil could occur in either country.</P>
      <P>The Austrade officials also discouraged investment in the
Philippines and Malaysia, saying the forthcoming presidential
elections in the Philippines could bring uncertainty as it is
possible that populist policies will be reintroduced there.</P>
      <P>They said Malaysia has taken a "reality check" and the market
turmoil has peaked, but there could be more bad news on the corporate
front and, as in most of Asia, the outlook for the building and
construction sector is particularly gloomy.</P>

    <DATELINE>Washington, Feb. 13 (CNA)
(By Jay Chen and Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An American conservationist has praised
Taiwan's decision to present a plane to South Africa to help in that
country's conservation efforts.</P>
      <P>Robert Cleaves, president of the Los Angles-based Wilderness
Conservancy, said the move showed Taiwan's commitment to conservation
has not been affected by politics.</P>
      <P>South African President Nelson Mandela announced in late 1996
that Pretoria would switch diplomatic recognition from Taipei to
Beijing at the end of 1997.</P>
      <P>Despite this, the government of the Republic of China on
Taiwan announced in 1997 that it would donate US$110,000 for the
purchase of a used six-seat plane. The Cessna U206F will be presented
to Kruger National Park in June after renovation work on it in the
United States is completed in March.</P>
      <P>Taiwan also presented a smaller single-engine plane to
anti-poaching rangers in Kruger National Park in September 1996.</P>
      <P>Cleaves said he had worried that the ROC government might renege
on its pledge to send the plane after the severance of the diplomatic
ties between Pretoria and Taipei, but that he was not surprised to
learn of Taipei's decision.</P>
      <P>The move shows the good will of the ROC, he said, adding that he
hopes the action is widely publicized so people will know what Taiwan
has done.</P>
      <P>As when the first plane was donated in 1996, there will be a
public presentation ceremony for the Cessna U206F. US news media,
including CBS, are planning to cover the donation, according to
Cleaves.</P>
      <P>The second plane will be used to help transport anti-poaching
personnel and to send them needed supplies so that they can remain in
the field longer. Kruger National Park is about two-thirds the size
of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The Cessna will also fly animal conservation specialists and
volunteer doctors and nurses to remote regions in South Africa.</P>

      <P>According to SEF Vice Chairman and Secretary-General Shi

political and academic figures in Taiwan, is scheduled to visit
Beijing Feb. 16-20 and Shandong Province Feb. 21-24.</P>
      <P>Although he described the nature of the visit as "purely

Taiwan research institutes in mainland China.</P>
      <P>Shi said the Taiwan delegates will exchange views with their
mainland counterparts on a wide range of topics during the visit,
which the SEF is describing as a routine exchange of activities
across the Taiwan Strait and not something necessarily aimed at

    <TEXT>
      <P>With direct shipping links between Russia
and Taiwan beginning this month and direct aviation links to follow
in March, the Russian liaison office in Taipei is taking on more
staff to help accelerate visa and other relevant services to people
on the island.</P>
      <P>Under concerted efforts with the Republic of China's Ministry of
Foreign Affairs (MOFA), the Russian liaison office here will soon be
capable of issuing visas to Taiwan residents in two working days,
according to James Wang, director of the MOFA's Department of West
Asian Affairs.</P>
      <P>About one month after Taipei and Moscow signed a bilateral
shipping agreement in Russia on Jan. 9, the first Russian cargo ship
reached the southern Taiwan port city of Kaohsiung on Feb. 10,
marking a new era of shipping links between Russia and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The maritime transport link allows Taiwan and Russian traders
faster and much more economic operations between the two sides, Wang
said, noting that it takes only five days for vessels to reach Taiwan
from the ice-free port of Vladivostok in eastern Russia.</P>
      <P>The new sea route also allows Taiwan shippers to take advantage
of Russia's three far eastern seaports, which will allow them access
to inner Europe via railways linking Siberia with continental Europe.</P>
      <P>It is expected that the new route will help local firms cut their
transportation costs and boost trade with Russia and Europe,
significantly contributing to economic exchanges between Taiwan and
that part of the world, Wang added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the first passenger flight between Moscow and Taipei
is scheduled for March 31, following the finalization of an
ROC-Russian aviation agreement last September.</P>
      <P>To mark the landmark aviation link, planes will take off
simultaneously from Taipei and Moscow on March 29, with the flight
destined for Taipei carrying a Russian delegation that will conduct
discussions with relevant ROC authorities on the further promotion of
aviation links between the two nations.</P>
      <P>Starting March 31, Taipei-based China Airlines will operate two
weekly flights to Moscow. The regular flights -- scheduled for every
Tuesday and Saturday -- will leave Chiang Kai-shek International
Airport at 2:25 p.m. and arrive in Moscow at 10:15 p.m. the same day.
The aircraft will then take off for a return flight to Taipei after a
one-hour stopover, according to Wang.</P>
      <P>Taiwan-Russian exchanges in the fields of tourism, trade, the
economy, education and culture have surged over the past six years,
with both sides committed to enhancing bilateral cooperation in many
other sectors.</P>
      <P>According to MOFA tallies, two-way trade between Taiwan and
Russia reached US$1.2 billion in 1996 and soared to US$1.45 billion

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING WON'T DEVALUE YUAN: M'LAND CHINESE VICE PREMIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Brussels,  Feb. 13 (CNA)
(By Tang Ping-chun and Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland Chinese Vice Premier Li Lanqing
has reasserted that Beijing won't devalue the yuan, though he noted
that the financial turmoil that has swept most of Asia will
inevitably affect mainland China's competitiveness and economic
growth.</P>
      <P>Li made the remarks here on Wednesday prior to the closure of his
three-day visit to Belgium.</P>
      <P>Li said at an economic and trade conference here between Brussels
and Beijing that the devaluation of the yuan would worsen the Asian
monetary crisis and lead to a vicious circle that would bring much
more trouble to the Chinese mainland, Asian countries and beyond,
according to a report in Thursday's edition of the Free Belgium
Times.</P>
      <P>Mainland China, which has US$140 billion in foreign exchange, had
foreign exports totaling up to US$325 billion last year while
enjoying a trade surplus of US$4 billion, he noted, adding that "with
all the factors combined, the Chinese yuan faces pressure to
appreciate instead of depreciate."</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, the daily reported, although mainland China's
economy has not yet been hit by the Asian currency crisis, Li
confessed that Beijing is waiting and ready for its impact: a loss in
the competitiveness of mainland Chinese exports and a decrease in
economic growth in particular.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN-US WTO TALKS 'TOUGH': ECONOMICS MINISTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 13 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Economics Minister Wang Chih-kang on Friday
termed the latest talks with the United States on terms for Taiwan's
entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO) as "tough," but vowed
to do his utmost to bring the talks to a successful conclusion.</P>
      <P>Wang, after speaking by telephone with Vice Economics Minister
Lin Yi-fu, who is now in the United States for the talks, said
negotiations on the service sector and industrial products have been
going smoothly, but a wide gap remains over agricultural goods.</P>
      <P>Wang, who will leave Saturday for the US for talks with US Trade
Representative Charlene Barshefsky, said the WTO consultations were
"unfair," adding that demands by WTO contracting parties are always
high and the ministry can only do its best to strike the most
favorable deal for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>But Wang said more delays and additional rounds of talks will
only result in fresh demands by the WTO members, which could be even
more damaging to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He added that every nonmember of the WTO is anxious to enter into
the world trade regulatory body so that they can enjoy the benefits
of lower tariffs. Taiwan received WTO observer status in 1992.</P>
      <P>The economics minister said the government has to consider the
interests of each industry as well as the overall interest of
the nation, thus making the talks extremely tough going.</P>
      <P>He said the National Pork Producers Council, a powerful lobby
group in Washington, has used every channel to influence the US
negotiators to exert pressure on Taiwan to pry open its markets.</P>
      <P>Sources also said that Senator Jesse Helms (R-NC), chairman of
the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee, had sent a message to
Stephen Chen, ROC representative in the United States, asking Taiwan
to accelerate the pace of its hog imports and to impose a single
tariff on imported pork.</P>
      <P>Peng Tzuo-kuei, chairman of the ROC Council of Agriculture, said
that after days of talks, the two sides have closed the gap on the
level of tariffs and quotas for rice and chicken, but the difference
on hogs and offal remains wide.</P>
      <P>Peng said while Taiwan asked the United States to allow more
adjustment time for lowering tariffs on certain agricultural
products, the US side has requested reciprocal compensatory
proposals.</P>
      <P>He said the opening of Taiwan's rice market will be based largely
on the "Japanese model," meaning that Taiwan will allow imports in
the amount of 4 percent of the local consumption level, or 60,000
tons of US rice annually after its entry into the WTO. Taiwan will
allow imports equivalent to 8 percent of domestic consumption, or
130,000 tons of US rice annually, beginning in the 6th year after its
WTO accession.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has already completed bilateral WTO consolations with 23
contracting parties to the Geneva-based trade body. The United
States is one of the three contracting parties that have yet to
finalize such talks with Taiwan. The other two are the 15-member
European Union and Switzerland.</P>

    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  Feb.  13 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang and Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Hailed by the Canadian Parliament as "the
father of the democratic movement in China," exiled mainland Chinese
dissident Wei Jingsheng remarked Thursday that democracy and human
rights in China as a whole are the best safeguard for the people in
Taiwan, Tibet and the mainland.</P>
      <P>Wei, who arrived from New York Wednesday night, was warmly
welcomed on Thursday by Canada's foreign affairs minister, minister
of Asian affairs, members of Parliament and the parliamentary
Committee on Foreign Affairs (CFA). He made the remarks to the CNA
correspondent in Ottawa after he gave testimony at a meeting of the
CFA.</P>
      <P>Wei went a step further in saying that all parties and factions
in Taiwan have had contacts with him, and what he hopes most is that
he will be "invited jointly by all the parties and factions" in
Taiwan. The exact time for such a visit has not been slated, but it
will probably come "in the latter half of 1998."</P>
      <P>None of the factions and organizations in Taiwan have offered him
any material, spiritual or financial support, Wei remarked. He did
not say whether he would accept any such support if offered.</P>
      <P>Regarding his impression of his contacts with various parties and
factions in Taiwan, Wei said that, generally speaking, Chinese on the
island of Taiwan want the "ultimate reunification" of China. However,
that must be accomplished under the precondition of a political
transformation in mainland China. Wei said he personally felt that
only under that premise could negotiations for reunification across
the Taiwan Strait begin on a sensible footing.</P>
      <P>As for the stanch pro-independence stalwarts in Taiwan, Wei
observed, they themselves surely know that they can't "pass the point
of no return."</P>
      <P>Concerning the Tibet issue, Wei said, he basically agrees with
the stance of the Dalai Lama, which is to secure human rights for the
Tibetans and their right of self-determination in cultural and
religious affairs through peaceful dialogue.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC ECONOMIC GROWTH TO SURPASS OTHER WORLD COUNTRIES: CEPD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 13 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's economy, which remains relatively
unscathed by the economic turmoil in Asia, will post an annual growth
this year that will make the world's Top 10 list, an official from
the Cabinet-level Council for Economic Planning and Development
(CEPD) said Friday.</P>
      <P>If the annual economic growth reaches 6.3 percent this year as
widely estimated by local economic think-tanks, the growth will be
the second best in the world, behind only mainland China, said Thomas
Yeh, director of the CEPD's Economic Research Department.</P>
      <P>Unaffected by the Asian economic crisis, Taiwan's economy,
building on last year's steady performance, is continuing to pick up
steam this year, with trade volume booming, its currency stabilized
and the drop in the local stock market kept to a minimum, Yeh pointed
out.</P>
      <P>The CEPD has set the annual growth target for 1998 at 6.7
percent, Yeh noted, adding however that real growth is expected by
CEPD researchers to come in at 6.3 percent or above. The discrepancy
arises because local commodity prices will remain unpredictable as
the fluctuation of the New Taiwan dollar against the US dollar during
the rest of 1998 is unclear. The NT dollar-greenback exchange rate
will remain the key factor influencing the island's economic
stability this year, Yeh added.</P>
      <P>By comparison, two local private economic think-tanks -- the
Chung-hua Institute for Economic Research and the Taiwan Institute of
Economic Research -- predicted that the island's economic growth will
top 6.37 percent and 6.25 percent, respectively, this year.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's major opposition Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) opened a three-day seminar on policies
toward mainland China Friday in Taipei.</P>
      <P>During the seminar, leaders of the party's major factions will
participate in three sessions of debates.</P>
      <P>The topics of the debates are "the influence of the new
international political order on the relationship between Taiwan and
mainland China during the post-Cold War era," "strategic planning
for bilateral consultations and interaction between Taiwan and
mainland China," and "the challenge to and the appropriate policy of
a World Trade Organization member country."</P>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Chen Shui-bian, who is a leader of the opposition
party, said Friday that the DPP's platform for Taiwan independence
and its position that Taiwan's future shall be decided by the people
of Taiwan in a referendum are the mainstream opinions of the party,
which will not be changed in any way by the debates in the seminar.</P>
      <P>Chen, who is not a participant in the debates, told the press
that Taiwan is a sovereign country independent of the People's
Republic of China. It is true that there is a country on either side
of the Taiwan Strait, he said, adding that "Taiwan is absolutely not
a vassal or a part of any other country."</P>
      <P>Speaking at the opening ceremony, DPP Chairman Hsu Hsin-liang

    <HEADLINE>HELMS ASKS TAIWAN TO OPEN ITS PORK MARKET</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Feb.  12  (CNA)
(By Herman Pan &amp; Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>American pig farmers have mobilized
Sen. Jesse Helms to speak for them in their attempt to get the
Republic of China on Taiwan to open its market to their products.</P>
      <P>Helms, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, on
Thursday sent a letter to Stephen Chen, ROC Representative to the
United States, urging Taiwan to speed up the liberalization of its
pork market.</P>
      <P>Helms, known as a long-time friend and supporter of the ROC, said
in the letter that he will help Taiwan enter the World Trade
Organization (WTO) as soon as possible and recommended that the
island open its pork market completely.</P>
      <P>Taipei and Washington are now engaged in talks on terms for
Taiwan to enter the WTO.</P>
      <P>The letter also urged Taipei to enact a tariff based on pork
market prices instead of maintaining the island's protection policy.
He expressed the US farmers' hope that the tariff will be under 15
percent and that the modified taxation will be reduced on a
year-to-year basis.</P>
      <P>The letter, which was drafted by the US National Pork Producers
Council (NPPC) and signed by Helms, expressed the hope that Taiwan
will open its market to US pork soon after the completion of the
Taipei-Washington WTO negotiations.</P>
      <P>The NPPC, which has some 80,000 members nationwide, enjoys close
relations with many members of the US Congress. The United States is
one of the largest agricultural exporters in the world.</P>
      <P>On March 19, 1997, Helms, from North Carolina, the second-largest
pork producing US state, wrote Jason Hu, then Taipei's representative
to Washington, about his wish that Taiwan liberalize its farm sector.</P>
      <P>Hu responded by asking the senator to understand that because a
foot-and-mouth disease epidemic forced the slaughter of most of the
island's pigs, Taiwan hog farmers were on the edge of bankruptcy and
needed the government's protection.</P>
      <P>The NPPC, however, was undeterred and mobilized several dozens of
members of Congress to push the US government to press for Taiwan
opening its market to US pork.</P>
      <P>Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, and Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., have
also recently written Secretary of Agriculture Dan Glickman to say
that the United States should take a tough stand on agricultural
issues in its bilateral WTO negotiations with Taiwan, mainland China
and Russia.</P>
      <P>Some 5,000 angry Taiwan farmers on Wednesday pelted Washington's
de facto embassy in Taipei with manure and eggs in protest against
the US demand that Taiwan remove its import ban on pork bellies and
internal organs in exchange for US support for Taiwan's accession to
the WTO.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  13  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Under formidable pressure triggered by
Taiwan's bid to join the World Trade Organization (WTO), the island's
hog farmers are considering relocating their operations to overseas
locations, like Canada, to evade increasing competition from foreign
imports and rising production costs.</P>
      <P>Taiwan hog farmers are facing unprecedented pressure. First came
an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease that ravaged the island's hog
population last year. Now comes the WTO negotiations with Washington
-- wherein Taipei is likely to agree to the imports of American pork
chops, bacon and offals -- which is expected to increase competition
in the local pork market.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that after markets are opened to US pork
products, Taiwan will lose about NT$15 billion (US$455 million) a
year in the pork market, and some 5 million hogs will be forced to be
cut from the annual production charting board.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taiwan's foodstuff producers are expected to suffer an
enormous shrinkage of their production after the island becomes a WTO
member, with annual production cut back some 50 percent from the
current 9 million metric tons worth NT$12 billion (US$364 million)
annually.</P>
      <P>Canada, which has cheaper hog-raising conditions than the United
States, will sponsor discussions on hog farming in the near future to
provide Taiwan hog raisers with more economical options for
relocating operations there.</P>

      <P>Eight shops were damaged and five houses
set ablaze on Thursday when hundreds of people ran amok in Jatiwangi,
about 90 km east of Bandung, Indonesia, officials said.</P>
      <P>The riot that rocked the town mainly involved hundreds of pedicab
drivers and blue-collar workers, who have been hard-hit by the
worsening economic crisis, they said.</P>
      <P>Residents said the violence started at about 10 a.m. after an
hour-long protest by a group of 50 pedicab drivers over a 100 percent
increase in the price of pedicab and bicycle tires.</P>
      <P>They targeted properties of people of Chinese descent.</P>
      <P>There was no word of injuries. Police said 19 rioters were
arrested for looting pedicab parts and grocery stores along a main
street.</P>
      <P>The situation was brought under control at about 1 p.m. after
hundreds of police officers and soldiers were deployed, the officials
said.</P>
      <P>Local military commander Col. Oding Mulyadi, who was on the
scene, said that the people's patience was wearing thin over the
soaring prices of essential goods.</P>
      <P>He said the riot began when the protesters were joined by minivan
drivers who had been on strike since Monday, also in protest at
rising prices of vehicle parts.</P>
      <P>Residents said the rioters "freely" pelted shops with stones,
looted the contents and set fire to stores until security personnel
arrived. Police said dozens of bicycles were burned together with the
shops.</P>
      <P>Heavy rain helped put out the fires and prompted many of the
rioters to disperse.</P>
      <P>West Java Governor R. Nurrians expressed his "deep concern" over
the violence.</P>
      <P>"The Majalengka regents told me the unrest was sparked by the
increasing prices of vehicle parts," he was quoted by the Jakarta

    <HEADLINE>AUSTRALIA MOVES TOWARD BECOMING REPUBLIC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Feb.  13  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia is moving toward becoming a
republic by the year 2000 or 2001 after republicans emerged as the
winners of a poll conducted on Thursday night.</P>
      <P>Thus, the monarchist system will be dumped after more than two
hundred years, since the continent became a British colony in late
18th century.</P>
      <P>Following five rounds of voting, a model proposed by the
Australian Republican Movement (ARM) emerged as the winner. The plan
envisages that the country's future president will be nominated by
community representatives and appointed by a two-thirds majority of
both houses of the federal Parliament.</P>
      <P>The ARM proposal on Thursday won 75 votes out of the 150
delegates to the Constitutional Convention in Canberra. But those
opposed to the ARM proposal also received 71 votes with two members
absent and four others abstaining.</P>
      <P>Only 43 delegates voted in favor of keeping the constitutional
monarchy, which, it now appears, will eventually be dumped.</P>
      <P>The preferred model by the ARM, however, will be subject to a
series of final votes on Friday to test the level of support for a
republic because it failed to win a clear majority.</P>
      <P>Core elements of the final model are:</P>
      <P>* The community, community organizations and the states are to be
asked to nominate candidates for the future president of the country;</P>
      <P>* Nominations will not be made public by the government;</P>
      <P>* Nominations will be screened by a community committee which
will recommend a short list to the prime minister;</P>
      <P>* The prime minister will move, and the opposition leader will
second, a single candidate who will become president on a two-thirds
vote of Parliament; and</P>
      <P>* The president can be removed by the prime minister, whose
decision must be confirmed by a majority of the House of
Representatives.</P>
      <P>If the prime minister's decision to remove a president is not
confirmed, it will be seen as a vote of no confidence in the prime
minister, requiring Parliament to pass a vote of confidence in the
same or a new prime minister, failing which an election must be
called.</P>
      <P>The model which finally emerged from the convention on Thursday
followed a series of compromises and modifications to the ARM's
original proposal because other republicans, who favored direct
popular election of the president, opposed the original idea.</P>
      <P>Prime Minister John Howard earlier said the convention must
produce a "clear view" and a "clear majority" on a preferred model so
that he can put it to a referendum next year that will ask
Australians whether they want to embrace a republic.</P>
      <P>He said he did not believe Thursday night's vote had handed the
republicans an unqualified victory.</P>

      <P>The situation in Indonesia has come under
control of the military and police, posing no threat to the personal
safety and property of ethnic Chinese and Taiwan businessmen in that
country, an official from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
(MOEA) said on Friday.</P>
      <P>H.J. Tsai, deputy director of the East Asian and Pacific Affairs

on the island of Flores over food shortages have not spread to the
capital city of Jakarta and that ethnic Chinese remain safe in that

the overall situation in that country in the run-up to presidential
elections slated for March 1.</P>
      <P>The MOEA, in cooperation with Taiwan businessmen associations and
ROC government outposts in Indonesia, has set up a network of
communication in case of any emergency, Tsai said, adding that the
MOEA also has contacted Indonesian local authorities in the hope that

not spread to Jakarta and all protests in the vicinity of the capital
were peaceful and took place with government permission.</P>
      <P>The MOEA voiced grave concern over the safety of ethnic Chinese

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  13  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A mainland Chinese dissident said here
Friday that Beijing leaders must be paying close attention to the
seminar on Taiwan's future policy toward mainland China, which is
being held in Taipei by the major opposition Democratic Progressive
Party.</P>
      <P>Wu'er Kaixi, one of the well-known student leaders in the 1989
Tiananmen Square incident, told the press after the first morning
session of the three-day seminar that the debates in the seminar may
have no clear conclusions, but they may be "the beginning of
maturing" in democratization.</P>
      <P>Beijing leaders may see the debates as very important to the
formation of the opposition party's policy toward mainland China, he
said. There are three sessions of debates in the seminar.</P>
      <P>He regretted that nobody talked anything about the situation on
the Chinese mainland. "You have to understand the situation there,
if you want to do a research on policies toward mainland China," he
said.</P>
      <P>Wu'er, who was wanted by mainland authorities in 1989 for
his connection with the Tiananmen incident, said Taiwan could be
badly hurt, if it decided to open political talks with the mainland
in a haste.</P>
      <P>He also pointed out that mainland China is now like the Taiwan
of the 1970s. The people on Taiwan should not lose their confidence
in the democratization of mainland China in the future, he added.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  13  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The suicide rate among the elderly in
Taiwan has risen once again, the Department of Health (DOH) said on
Friday.</P>
      <P>DOH officials said the overall suicide rate in Taiwan peaked in
1981 at 0.129 per one thousand people. They attributed that figure to
a series of social transformations in Taiwan at that time which had a
great impact upon the local population. The rate has since declined
gradually.</P>
      <P>But in 1996, the rate rebounded again, due in part to a rise in
suicides among the island's elderly.</P>
      <P>The officials said that senior citizens over the age of 65 have
traditionally registered the highest suicide rate among all age
groups. The rate had been in decline over recent years, but jumped to
three people per thousand in 1996.</P>
      <P>Compared with the United States, Germany, Britain, Italy, Japan,
Australia, Singapore, South Korea, and mainland China, only Japan and
Singapore have registered a higher rate of suicide among the elderly.</P>
      <P>Some commentators have suggested that statistic could be
interpreted to mean the elderly in Taiwan lead unhappy lives in the

    <HEADLINE>CLEANER, MORE-EFFICIENT HYBRID BUS BEGINS TESTING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Los  Angeles,  Feb.  12  (CNA)
(By Philip Liu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Testing on a revolutionary and
environmentally-friendly transit bus -- one of the most advanced in
the United States -- began Thursday.</P>
      <P>Utilizing a combination of battery and propane power, the hybrid
electric bus makes use of the newest technologies for greatly
improving fuel-economy, lowering emissions and reducing noise.</P>
      <P>The new bus is an important step in the push for cleaner air,
higher efficiency and high-tech jobs, according to CALSTART, a
non-profit advanced transportation technologies organization. In
addition to fewer emissions, the bus incorporates a series of other
features that transit users will appreciate, including a flat floor
for easy ingress, and quieter, smoother operation, it said.</P>
      <P>"The recently signed global warming accords at Kyoto really bring
home the need and potential for this type of technology," said
Michael J. Gage, president of CALSTART. "Increasingly efficient,
clean transportation solutions such as this bus -- ready for
deployment today -- clearly show the technical realities this growing
industry can deliver."</P>
      <P>The bus utilizes a new generation hybrid-electric driveline that
greatly reduces pollution, vibration and noise. Two electric motors,
producing the equivalent of approximately 180 horsepower, power the
bus. An advanced nickel-cadmium battery pack fuels the electric
motors and can be charged on demand by a propane-fueled,
rotary-engine generator.</P>
      <P>The hybrid combination allows the bus to operated in three
separate modes.</P>
      <P>When operating on batteries alone, the bus produces zero
emissions and can travel up to 45 miles. If traction requirements can
be met by the battery but accessories -- such as air conditioning,
lights or windshield wipers -- are needed, the generator operates in
a low-power mode. A high-power mode is also available, which further
charges the batteries and is capable of extending the vehicles' duty
cycle to a total of 230 miles, depending on terrain.</P>
      <P>Running full-time, the generator consumers only 2.8 gallons of
propane per hour, offering the hope that this vehicle will be the
first of a new generation of city buses, CALSTART said.</P>

      <P>The TSSA said the Bangkok conference with Beijing's Strait
Shipping Exchange Association, which began on Wednesday without prior
announcement and ended on Friday, was a social gathering of two
private groups aimed only at exchanging views on technical shipping
issues.</P>
      <P>The TSSA voiced the desire of Taiwan shippers for Beijing to open
more ports to Taiwan shipping firms and discussed with their mainland

      <P>Department of Health (DOH) Director-General
C.H. Chan on Friday demanded that two foreign makers of blood
products allocate a total of NT$160 million as compensation for local
hemophiliacs who contracted the AIDS virus after receiving
transfusions of their tainted products.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the DOH is willing to provide moral support and
help local victims seek compensation from the two foreign companies,
Chan said that he wants Bayer Co. and the other foreign firm to
provide NT$2 million for each of the 53 victims within one week,
depositing the money with an impartial third party as a way of
showing their sincerity in wishing to resolve the problem.</P>
      <P>The DOH will prohibit the import of any new medical products from
either of the two firms if they refuse to do so, Chan warned.</P>
      <P>According to Chan, the victims are dissatisfied with a NT$1.2

      <P>Mulyanto said in a fax sent to the Ministry of Economic Affairs

Indonesia and that the Indonesian government is working quickly to
address all its current problems.</P>
      <P>Describing many media reports about the recent situation in

(By Lin Wen-fen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Shih Ming-teh, former chairman of the
opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), on Friday proposed a
"Great Chinese Commonwealth" scheme to serve as a model for the
unification of the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Shih said that as the "Great Chinese Commonwealth," Taiwan and
mainland China would be international legal entities of equal status,
claiming that his design can not only avoid the eruption of
cross-strait war but can also safeguard Taiwan's independent
sovereignty.</P>
      <P>Shih made the remarks after presiding over the morning session of
the DPP's "Mainland China Policy" seminar, aimed at providing a forum
to debate the party's future policy towards the mainland. Shih
expressed dissatisfaction with the morning discussion, saying that he
"cannot listen to them any more," and decided to propose his "Great
Chinese Commonwealth" scheme.</P>
      <P>Saying that his "Great Chinese Commonwealth" is different from
the "Great China Commonwealth" or the mainland-proposed "one country,
two systems" scheme, he explained that although the commonwealth
itself is an incomplete international legal entity, it is composed of
members which are internationally recognized legal entities. The
character of the relationships between the member countries shall be
defined by the members in a contract, he added.</P>
      <P>Shih said that Taiwan can propose to the mainland that the two
sides conduct unification talks under the principle of a "Great
Chinese Commonwealth," a version similar to the British Commonwealth
of Nations. Even if the talks fail to lead to the implementation of a
"Great Chinese Commonwealth," Taiwan can at least gain a little more
time for itself.</P>
      <P>According to Shih, four designs can serve as possible models for
the reunification of the two sides of the Taiwan Strait -- mainland
China's "one country, two systems," Taiwan's "unification under the
Three Principles of the People," the American federalist system and
Britain's commonwealth.</P>
      <P>The former DPP chairman claimed that the "two Chinas" or "one
China, one Taiwan" models are actually seeking Taiwan independence,
while the "Great Chinese Commonwealth" model can secure Taiwan's
independent sovereignty and also avoid the occurrence of cross-strait
conflict.</P>

Brittan has proposed new ideas on the services sector in talks with
mainland China's Vice Premier Li Lanqing about Beijing's bid to join
the World Trade Organization (WTO), a Geneva newspaper reported on
Friday.</P>
      <P>"We have had very good discussions both on the political and
economic side of China's relations with Europe," Brittan told a joint
press conference with Li during a break in their talks in Brussels,
the Tribune of Geneva said.</P>
      <P>"We are working actively for China's early membership of the
WTO," Brittan was quoted as saying.</P>
      <P>Li was quoted as saying that he had a "very candid and friendly
exchange of views" with Brittan on the early conclusion of WTO
negotiations. "We shared the wish that this matter will be resolved
as soon as possible."</P>
      <P>Mainland China needs the WTO but the WTO also needs mainland
China, because without universal representation, it will be very hard
for the Geneva-based world trade regulatory body to play its role,"
Li was quoted as saying.</P>
      <P>Brittan said he had put forward some "specific ideas" for the
next stage of accession negotiations, involving market access for
trade in services, the paper reported.</P>
      <P>Brittan said Europe has to understand that mainland China needs
time to implement some of the agreed measures for WTO accession.</P>
      <P>He said he also outlined to Li a document under preparation in
the European Commission that proposes a new EU policy towards
mainland China.</P>
      <P>Brittan said the document, expected to be issued in April, will
set out the EU's agenda for a more active relationship that will do
more to recognize mainland China as a global power.</P>

      <P>Hailing his visit to Seoul as an important
step toward rapprochement between Seoul and Taipei, John Chang,
visiting secretary-general of Taiwan's ruling Kuomintang (KMT), said
here on Friday that the two countries have reached a consensus on
improving ties.</P>
      <P>At a press conference called at his hotel, Chang refused to even
name the South Korean leaders he met here, on the grounds of an
"understanding" with the host country, let alone the contents of
their discussions. However, he did say he was impressed with Seoul's
determination to mend fences with Taipei.</P>
      <P>He dismissed as "untrue" media reports that the KMT has promised
to grant South Korea financial aid to tide it over its financial
woes, but added: "We are more than willing to help a suffering
neighbor state get through the hardship it faces, but any such deal
needs in-depth negotiations. Thus far, there is no such deal or
promise."</P>
      <P>Knowing that reporters from the mainland-China based Xinhua News
Agency and The People's Daily were at the news conference, Chang
criticized Beijing's attempts to block Seoul from any contact with
Taipei as "unwise."</P>
      <P>Although Chang didn't mention the names of the Korean leaders he
called on, president-elect Kim Dae Jung was definitely not one of
them, because he missed an opportunity to met with Kim at the
headquarters of Kim's National Congress for New Politics "by chance."</P>
      <P>Chang, accompanied by Korean congressman Soon Se Il, arrived at
the headquarters for a courtesy call on its acting president, Cho Se
Hyung, at 11:10 a.m., ten minutes after Kim left after receiving

      <P>Republic of China Foreign Minister Jason Hu
disclosed on the eve of his six-state African trip that a proposed
African trip for President Lee Teng-hui will be finalized and
announced no later than March 2.</P>
      <P>So far, details of the president's visit are still being worked
out by the Foreign Ministry and the potential countries to be
included in the visit, and no final decision has been made, said Hu.</P>
      <P>He brushed aside questions about whether Guinea Bissau will be
included in Lee's proposed trip because of an invitation extended to
Lee by visiting Guinea Bissau Prime Minister Carlos Augusto Correia,
saying that Lee would like to accept the invitation but no decision
has yet been made.</P>
      <P>Correia arrived in Taipei on Tuesday and was slated to leave on
Saturday.</P>
      <P>Hu, who is set to depart on Saturday for his own African trip,
said that Lee's itinerary is expected to be finalized after his
return on Feb. 23, and will be announced before March 2.</P>
      <P>This will be Hu's third trip to Africa since assuming the post of
foreign minister in October. The journey will take him to Chad,

    <HEADLINE>ROC NATIONALS MAKE MORE THAN 11 MILLION VISITS TO MAINLAND CHINA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 14 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China nationals have made more
than 11 million applications to visit mainland China over the past 10
years, according to statistics released by the Mainland Affairs
Council (MAC) on Saturday.</P>
      <P>The tallies show that ROC nationals made 11.44 million
applications to visit the mainland between 1988 and October 1997.</P>
      <P>The ROC government began allowing its people to travel across the
Taiwan Strait for family reunions in late 1987, and restrictions on
mainland-bound visits have been further eased gradually over the past
decade.</P>
      <P>According to the statistics, Taiwan residents made 1.56 million
applications to travel to the mainland in the first 10 months of last
year, an increase of 292,000 applications over the same period of
1996.</P>
      <P>In compiling the tallies, the MAC referred to data released by
mainland authorities concerning the number of Taiwan people who
applied for mainland China entry permits in Hong Kong during the
ten-year period.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, statistics released by the Bureau of Entry and Exit
show that the bureau approved applications by 58,070 ROC passport
holders to visit the mainland in 1997, down 253 from the 1996 level.</P>
      <P>MAC officials said the huge gap between Taiwan and mainland
tallies resulted mainly from different entry/exit regulations. The
ROC now offers three-year multiple entry/exit permits for its
ordinary citizens. This means that with the exception of ROC
intelligence officers, high-ranking government officials and males
nearing the conscription age, local residents do not need to apply
for a separate permit to visit the mainland every time. Mainland
regulations, however, require Taiwan residents to apply for an entry
permit for each individual visit.</P>
      <P>MAC tallies also show that 42,491 mainland people were allowed to
visit Taiwan in 1997 to meet relatives, up 10,315 persons from the
1996 level. Another 3,242 mainland residents were allowed to settle
in Taiwan in 1997, 708 fewer than in the preceding year.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 1,177 illegal mainland immigrants were seized last
year, down 472 from 1996. In 1997, Taiwan managed to repatriate a
total of 1,216 mainland stowaways detained over the past few years.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FIVE SUSPECTS ARRESTED IN MICROCHIP ROBBERY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  14 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Five suspects wanted in connection with a
robbery earlier this month of SDRAM (synchronous dynamic random
access memory) chips, one of the most widely used microchips in the
digital industry, have been arrested, police said on Saturday.</P>
      <P>Police received a tip-off that a teenager surnamed Lai was
involved in the theft, and arrested him at the Chiang Kai-shek
International Airport on Friday as he was about to leave the country.</P>
      <P>Lai admitted that he and four others posed as police and
intercepted a truck loaded with SDRAM chips with an estimated value
of US$5 million in the Hsinchu Science-based Industrial Park, just a
few minutes after they were loaded into the truck in front of the
United Test Center (UTC) on Feb. 2.</P>
      <P>The five ordered Huang Yun-chang, the 25-year-old truck driver,
to pull over for a routine security check.</P>
      <P>The suspects forced Huang into a sedan that had been following
the truck and two of the robbers then took off in the truck.</P>
      <P>Police later arrested the four others, all of whom are gang
members with previous convictions for robbery, intimidation and
burglary.</P>
      <P>Vigilant customs officers ensured that none of the stolen chips
made it off the island, and police were able to recover them all in
Taichung, central Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Police are still investigating to find out if anyone masterminded
the robbery.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, UTC officials praised the police efforts and said they
were happy to recover all the stolen products -- tailor-made for
notebook computer makers in Japan and Germany.</P>
      <P>They said they suffered no financial losses because the chips
were insured, but they expressed hope that the park administration
will step up security to avoid a repeat of the incident, saying that
it will damage the interests of the businesses in the park, as well
as harm Taiwan's international image.</P>
      <P>Wang Kung, administrator of the Hsinchu Science-based
Industrial Park, said that the park will step up security, adding
that in the first half of this year, private security guards will be
introduced to work hand-in-hand with the police force in the park.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US, JAPANESE EXPERTS TO TIP TAIWAN MAKERS AGAINST DUMPING CHARGES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  14 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>American and Japanese officials have been
invited to Taipei to tip Taiwan's business and industrial sectors on
how to handle dumping charges from foreign governments, sources from
the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) reported Saturday.</P>
      <P>The MOEA's International Trade Commission (ITC) is scheduled to
sponsor an international symposium against dumping March 2-3 in
Taipei, with the key speakers including Judith Czako, who is in
charge of protocol at the World Trade Organization (WTO); Lynn
Featherstone, a section chief at the US International Trade
Commission; and an official from Japan's Ministry of International
Trade and Industry.</P>
      <P>During the symposium, the foreign officials will speak on a
number of topics, including the WTO's anti-dumping agreement,
anti-dumping cases concerning US high-tech products and know-how, and
how the Japanese government helps Japan's high-tech industry evade
dumping charges.</P>
      <P>The importance of such a symposium has been highlighted by
reports that on Friday the US Commerce Department found Taiwan's
leading microchip makers -- United Microelectronics Corp. (UMC) and
Winbond Electronics Corp. -- guilty of dumping SRAMs and ordered that
their sales to the United States be hit with prohibitively high
anti-dumping duties.</P>
      <P>Winbond is reportedly to receive an anti-dumping duty as high as
102.88 percent on its SRAMs into the United States, while UMC will
have an anti-dumping duty of 93.87 percent forced on it.</P>
      <P>As one of the world's leading exporters of high-tech products,
Taiwan should equip its makers and exporters with sufficient
industrial and legal knowledge to meet challenges from competitive
nations, ITC officials said, adding that the island's manufacturers
are often charged with dumping in an effort to cut Taiwan's
competitive edge.</P>

    <HEADLINE>RIOTS AT TAIWANESE FACTORY IN LESOTHO KILL TWO, INJURE SEVERAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Johannesburg,  Feb.  13  (CNA)
(By J.S. Chang &amp; Lin Wen-fen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A riot in a factory owned by
Taiwanese businessmen in the Southern African kingdom of Lesotho on
Friday has resulted in the death of two workers and the wounding of
more than 40 others.</P>
      <P>Workers at the Hsieh An textile factory in the town of
Ha-Thetsane, southeast of the capital, Maseru, went on strike a week
ago to demand higher pay. The strike turned into a riot when around
1,000 striking workers took the plant management hostage on Thursday
night and spent the night at the factory.</P>
      <P>By Friday morning the situation had deteriorated further as
striking workers threw stones at the factory and attacked people of
Chinese origin. One mainland Chinese employed as a worker there was
killed, while another mainland Chinese who was part of a medical team
was injured in the riot.</P>
      <P>A nearby textile factory run by the leader of a local Chinese
community, Chang Hsi-chia, was also affected.</P>
      <P>Police rushed to the Hsieh An factory on Friday morning. After
failing to disperse the violent crowd with an eviction order, they
opened fire on the rioters, reportedly killing one female worker and
injuring more than 40 others. Six of the injured are said to be in
critical condition.</P>
      <P>Feng Tai, director of Taipei's liaison office in Johannesburg,
said on Friday that, fearing the riot might turn into an anti-Chinese
demonstration, the office has contacted leaders of the local Chinese
community in Lesotho, asking them to urge Taiwanese businessmen to
leave the country immediately for their own safety.</P>
      <P>Feng pointed out that according to his understanding, more than
90 of the some 100 Taiwanese businessmen living in Lesotho had
already fled to South Africa on Friday following the outbreak of
rioting at the factory. Most of them are staying with friends and
relatives in the town of Ladybrand, not far from the border, he
added.</P>
      <P>In 1991, a similar riot and anti-Chinese demonstration prompted
almost all of the Taiwanese businessmen in Lesotho to leave the
country. Most of them settled in Ladybrand, going to Lesotho to take
care of business and returning across the border to Ladybrand at
night. After the situation in Lesotho was stabilized, a portion of
the Taiwanese businessmen returned to live there.</P>
      <P>Feng said that if necessary, he and two other officials will go
to Ladybrand or Lesotho to offer assistance to their countrymen.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA)
will assist Taiwan manufacturers of static random access memory
(SRAM) chips in fighting US dumping charges, Economics Minister Wang
Chih-kang said on Saturday.</P>
      <P>Wang made the statement prior to his departure for the United
States for consultations on terms for Taiwan's entry into the World
Trade Organization (WTO).</P>
      <P>Wang said he will take advantage of his visit to gain a better
understanding of the US stance on the SRAM dumping charges.</P>
      <P>"Local SRAM manufacturers may still have an opportunity to defeat
the US dumping charges," Wang said, adding that the MOEA will offer
them all possible assistance.</P>
      <P>The US Department of Commerce (DOC) said on Friday it has
delivered a final verdict on dumping charges filed by US-based Micron
Co. last March against Taiwan and South Korean SRAM makers.</P>
      <P>According to the verdict, the US will impose heavy anti-dumping
tariffs on SRAMs produced by nearly all major Taiwan chip makers. DOC
Assistant Secretary Roberts Larussa has already signed the verdict,
but the DOC won't make a formal announcement until next Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Wang said the DOC's verdict has been referred to the US
International Trade Commission (ITC) for adjudication. The ITC is
scheduled to hold a final public hearing on the case on Feb. 18 and
will decide by the end of March whether Taiwan makers have hurt
Micron's interests. If the ITC upholds the verdict, Taiwan-made SRAMs
will be subject to punitive tariff rates starting in April. The
punitive rates range from 7.59 percent to 102.88 percent.</P>
      <P>Wang said he will do his utmost to help local chip makers fight
the charges and will make their stance known to the US government and
their American counterparts during his visit to Washington, D.C.</P>
      <P>Wang is expected to meet with senior American trade officials,
including US Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky, on Feb. 17-18
to seek a major breakthrough in bilateral WTO-related talks.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and US negotiators started their 17th round of WTO talks
last week. Although they have reached consensus on some technical
issues, major obstacles still remain. Wang's participation in the
negotiations is expected to help push the two sides closer together
on some thorny issues, particularly those related to the farming
sector.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>While three US religious leaders are
visiting mainland China to try to gain a first-hand understanding of
the extent of religious freedom there, a Hong Kong-based human rights
group has disclosed a document that it says details religious
persecution in the Chinese mainland.</P>
      <P>According to a document marked "secret" that the Hong Kong-based
Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China
faxed to a New York-based human rights group on Friday, Beijing is
using "loyalty to the (Communist) Party and to the Nation" as a
criterion to assess the "legality" of religious activity.</P>
      <P>Any religious activity that is not deemed as meeting this loyalty
test is regarded as illegal and receives harsh treatment, the
Information Center said.</P>
      <P>The Hong Kong group said the document came from the office of the
Party Committee of Wuxian City, Zhejiang Province, and dates from
March 1997.</P>
      <P>In order to suppress the activities of Christians, the document
says, Wuxian established an ad hoc committee headed by the office of
the Party Committee and comprising members from the city's public
security organizations, united front work department, propaganda
department, judicial organizations, department of civil affairs and
other relevant groups.</P>
      <P>The document lists methods used to suppress religious activities,
including monitoring the activities of believers and collecting
information on them, sowing discord and attempting to alienate the
believers, prohibiting religious gatherings in homes, confiscating
religious propaganda, banning juveniles and Party cadres from joining
religious activities, closing down churches built by private
organizations, and arresting those having contacts with churches
abroad.</P>
      <P>The counter-religious activities that took place in Wuxian were
part of a wide-scale suppression of religion throughout Zhejiang
Province and in accordance with the spirit of the Sixth Plenary
session of the 14th National Congress of the Communist Party of
China, the document says.</P>
      <P>The Information Center said that the secret document shows that
religious persecution in the Chinese mainland was not limited to
Zhejiang Province in the first half of 1997 but was conducted
throughout mainland China as a whole.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US UPHOLDS DUMPING CHARGES AGAINST TAIWAN'S SRAM MAKERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington, Feb. 13 (CNA)
(By Herman Pan and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The US Department of Commerce (DOC) has
delivered a final verdict on dumping charges against Taiwan and South
Korean manufacturers of static random access memory (SRAM) chips,
the department's International Trade Agency (ITA) said on Friday.</P>
      <P>ITA officials said DOC Assistant Secretary Robert S. Larussa has
signed the verdict and punitive anti-dumping tariff rates for
individual Taiwan and Korean SRAM makers, but the DOC won't make a
formal announcement until next Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Although the verdict is still pending a final adjudication by
the federal International Trade Commission (ITC), lawyers
commissioned by Taiwan firms to handle the case said they believe
the dumping charges will stand.</P>
      <P>According to US anti-dumping regulations, the ITC will hold a
final public hearing on the dumping charges on Feb. 18 and will
decide by the end of March whether Taiwan SRAM makers have really
hurt interests of Micron, the US firm which filed the dumping charges
in March 1997. If the ITC upholds the DOC's final verdict,
Taiwan-made SRAMs will be subject to punitive anti-dumping tariff
rates starting in April.</P>
      <P>The lawyers said the only good news was that the DOC rejected
Micron's demand that Taiwan-made SRAMs set in motherboards be
subject to punitive anti-dumping tariffs. "The exclusion of SRAMs
built in motherboards will help minimize damage to Taiwan makers,"
said Chris Corr, a lawyer commissioned by many Taiwan companies to
handle the dumping charges.</P>
      <P>Taiwan accounts for 60 percent of the annual global motherboard
production, and many Taiwan makers inlay SRAMs made by local
companies into their motherboards before exporting them to the US.</P>
      <P>Another lawyer, Jonny Chiu, said it was discouraging that
punitive tariff rates listed in the DOC's final verdict for some
Taiwan companies are higher than those proposed in its initial
verdict delivered last September.</P>
      <P>Chiu said the increases in punitive rates indicate that
the ITA didn't accept Taiwan companies' argument that
research spending and stocks offered to their employees should be
caculated as production costs.</P>
      <P>According to the final verdict, the anti-dumping tariff rate for
SRAMs produced by Taiwan's Windbond Electronics will reach 102.83
percent, compared to 94.1 percent originally proposed. The punitive
tariff rate for another major Taiwan semicroductor producer United
Microelectronics Corp. also increases from 63.36 percent to 93.87
percent, while the rate for Alliance Semiconductor Corp. drops from
59.06 percent to 50.58 percent, and that for Hsicheng Co. is lowered
to 7.59 percent from 10.96 percent.</P>
      <P>The three Taiwan companies which failed to respond to
questionnaires sent by the DOC -- Texas-Acer Instruments, Best
Integrated Technology and Advanced Microelectronics -- will be
subject to an extremely high punitive rate of 113.85 percent.</P>
      <P>All other Taiwan SRAM makers will be subject to a punitive
rate of 41.98 percent, slightly higher than 41.3 percent
proposed in the initial verdict.</P>
      <P>Legal experts said the ITC, while delivering its final
adjudication, is not expected to change the punitive tariff rates
proposed in the DOC's final verdict.</P>
      <P>The United States is a major export outlet for Taiwan-made
SRAMs, accounting for about half of Taiwan's total SRAM exports.
Taiwan exported US$137 million and US$93.4 million worth of SRAMs in
1995 and 1996, respectively. Taiwan accounts for about 9 percent
of America's SRAM import market, compared to a 20 percent market
share held by South Korea.</P>
      <P>Information-technology industry experts said the US anti-dumping
verdict will certainly have an adverse impact on Taiwan SRAM
makers as the punitive rates are very high.</P>
      <P>Most worrisome was that Micron may file dumping charges against
Taiwan and Korean makers of dynamic random access memory (DRAM) chips
following its victory in the SRAM dumping charges. If so, Taiwan's
semiconductor manufacturers will be hurt even more drastically
because DRAMs account for the lion's share of their exports.</P>

      <P>Ruling Kuomintang Secretary-General John
Chang returned to Taipei on Saturday after a fruitful four-day visit
to South Korea.</P>
      <P>A spirited Chang said upon his arrival at Chiang Kai-shek
International Airport that his visit marks an important step toward
the rapprochement between the Republic of China and South Korea.
Taipei-Seoul relations have reamined at low ebbs since South Korea
switched diplomatic recognition to Beijing in August 1992.</P>
      <P>During his visit, Chang said he was impressed by the desire
expressed by Korean politicians to improve ties with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chang didn't elaborate on details of his itinerary in Seoul. But
reports from South Korea said Chang managed to meet with South Korean
Prime Minister-designate Kim Jong-pil on Friday.</P>
      <P>Kim, who has been named by Korean President-elect Kim
Dae-jung as next prime minister, held a closed-door meeting
with Chang at the latter's hotel room early Friday morning,
according to the reports. Kim was accompanied by one of his close
aides during his meeting with Chang.</P>
      <P>During their brief meeting, Kim reportedly denied a Korean
newspaper report that he had asked mainland China to offer a US$30
billion loan to his country during his recent trip to Beijing.</P>
      <P>Kim, who has been friendly toward Taiwan, also expressed his
willingness to promote substantive ties with the ROC in the
future.</P>
      <P>On Friday, Chang also met with Kim Dae-jung's special economic
adviser Lew Jong-keun. who has a doctorate in economics from New
York State University.</P>
      <P>On behalf of Kim, Lew reportedly had exchange views with Chang on
how to boost bilateral relations after Kim takes office later this
month.</P>
      <P>Reliable sources said Kim once sent a personal letter to ROC
President Lee Teng-hui, expressing his intention to appoint Lew as
a key liaison officer with Taipei in order to further strengthen
bilateral ties.</P>
      <P>Chang left for Seoul on Wednesday. While there, he had met with
top leaders of major South Korean political parties and many
business and industry heavyweights.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC, US REACH CONSENSUS ON SOME WTO ISSUES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Feb. 14 (CNA)
(By Herman Pan and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Negotiators from the Republic of China
and the United States have reached consensuses on some trade issues
after five days of intensive talks on terms for Taiwan's entry to
the World Trade Organization (WTO).</P>
      <P>Lin Shiang-nung, vice chairman of the Council of Agriculture and
Taiwan's chief farm trade negotiator with the US, said on Friday
that the two sides have almost come to terms on the opening of
Taiwan's chicken meat market, timetables for farm trade tariff
reductions and issues related to wine and tobacco imports.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Lin said, huge gaps still exist between the two
sides concerning issues related to pork, animal intestines and rice
trade.</P>
      <P>Lin said the US government, under heavy pressure from American
hog ranchers, has insisted that Taiwan fully open its pork market
following its WTO entry.</P>
      <P>The US originally demanded that Taiwan reduce its tariff rates on
a number of agricultural products to an average of 12 percent by
2002 from the current 20 percent. But Lin said the US has agreed
that Taiwan can lower its tariff rates on some fruits to WTO
standards until 2004.</P>
      <P>The two sides will continue to discuss agricultural issues on
Saturday.</P>
      <P>On the tobacco and wine trade, Vice Finance Minister Wu
Chia-sheng said Taiwan has agreed to impose zero tariffs on all white
spirits starting in 2000 and that smuggled tobaccos and alcholic
products seized by customs offices will be auctioned off, donated to
suitable organizations or re-exported. At present, all such goods are
destroyed. The two sides also reached a consensus on tariff rates on
imported cigarettes, but Wu would not reveal details.</P>
      <P>ROC Economics Minister Wang Chih-kang will arrive in Washington
on Monday and is scheduled to meet with senior US trade officials
on Feb. 17-18 to discuss some policy issues and seek major
breakthroughs in order to finalize bilateral WTO talks as soon as
possible.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MALAYSIAN PM CALLS FOR FLEXIBILITY IN TIES WITH SINGAPORE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  Feb.  14  (CNA)
(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad said on Friday that Malaysia and Singapore could resolve many
of their bilateral problems if both countries could be flexible and
not stick rigidly to their positions, The Straits Times reported on
Saturday in a dispatch from Kuala Lumpur.</P>
      <P>Both sides must be willing to see each other's point of view, he
told The Straits Times in an interview ahead of Singapore Prime
Minister Goh Chok Tong's visit to Kuala Lumpur on Monday.</P>
      <P>"There must be areas for compromise or there is no point talking
at all. We are prepared not to be rigid and we expect that both sides
must do it... Being flexible is being willing to give up something to
gain something," he was quoted as saying.</P>
      <P>Mahathir said there was a feeling in Singapore that Malaysia will
stop water supplies to Singapore on the expiry of the existing
agreement in 2061. This, he said, is not Malaysia's intention, and he
is willing to negotiate the issue so long as it is not to Kuala
Lumpur's disadvantage, the report said.</P>
      <P>Mahathir also said Malaysia has a different interpretation of the
Points of Agreement (POA) signed with Singapore in 1990.</P>
      <P>The pact spelt out clearly the terms on the development and
status of land owned by Malayan Railway (KTM) in Singapore.</P>
      <P>Under the agreement, KTM land in Singapore's Tanjong Pagar,
Kranji and Woodlands was to be developed jointly by the two
countries.</P>
      <P>Problems later arose when Mahathir sought to change the
agreement, including his proposal to build an electric train track
from Singapore to Kuala Lumpur and beyond for a trans-Asian railway.</P>
      <P>In a speech to the Singapore parliament in June last year, Goh
said the electric train and other changes would require an amendment
to the POA. This, he pointed out, could create legal and political
difficulties.</P>
      <P>Mahathir on Friday said the differences over the POA need not be
a stumbling block to better Singapore-Malaysia ties, which become
strained over Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew's statements last year
about crime in Johor.</P>
      <P>Asked if he wanted the POA to be revised totally, he replied:
"We'll look at it... We are quite prepared to examine it and to see
the other point of view."</P>
      <P>Mahathir said bilateral relations now are much better compared to
last year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>"GREAT CHINESE COMMONWEALTH" PROPOSAL SEEN AS IMPRACTICABLE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Feb.   14  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Several leaders of Taiwan's major
opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) said Saturday that the
"Great Chinese Commonwealth" proposal discussed in a seminar on DPP
policy toward mainland China Friday is not practicable.</P>
      <P>Foreign DPP chairman Shih Ming-teh proposed in the seminar that
mainland China and Taiwan hold talks on the establishment of a
"Great Chinese Commonwealth" in order to resolve the problem of
national unification.</P>
      <P>The three-day seminar is sponsored by the DPP as a forum for
debates on DPP's future policy toward mainland China. There are three
sessions of debates in the agenda.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Chou Po-lun said that the proposal is not
practicable because a commonwealth is an organization of friendly
sovereign countries and mainland China does not see Taiwan as a
sovereign country. It is impossible to talk about it at a time when
communist China is still threatening to use military force if Taiwan
formally declares independence, he added.</P>
      <P>Shen Fu-hsiung, a factional leader of the DPP, said the proposal
is contingent on Beijing's consent. If Beijing doesn't like it, it
is impossible to hold talks on it.</P>
      <P>Yen Wan-ching, director of the Mainland Chinese Affairs Department
of the DPP, said the proposal is a "too distant expectation,"
because communist China may not become a friendly country and
recognize Taiwan as a sovereign country in the short term. But he
said that the ruling Kuomintang has commissioned certain scholars to
study a similar idea, and that the DPP had better continue to pay
attention to it.</P>
      <P>Yen Ching-fu, another factional leader of the DPP, said it is
possible to talk about a great Chinese commonwealth for economic and
trade promotional purposes, but not for political purposes.</P>

    <DATELINE>Washington,  Feb.  13  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>U. S. Congressman Sherrod Brown
(Ohio-D) introduced Thursday a resolution calling for Taiwan's
admission to the World Health Organization (WHO), and urging the U.
S. government to support it.</P>
      <P>An official of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative
Office in Washington said Friday that the resolution, endorsed by
eight other members of the House of Representatives, is highly
appreciated, and that it is too early to predict its outcome at the
present time.</P>
      <P>Resolutions calling for Taiwan's admission to world
trade organizations have been introduced in U.S. Congress in the
past few years, while Brown's resolution is the first of its kind that
says Taiwan should be admitted to an organization of the United
Nations.</P>
      <P>Brown, senior member of the House Health and Environment
Subcommittee, said in a statement inserted into the
Congressional Record on Feb. 12 that a lofty goal of the WHO is to
enable people of the world to enjoy good health, but the 21 million
people on Taiwan are now unable to receive the latest medical
knowledge and technology from the world health organization, and
Taiwan is unable to contribute its rich resources and technology to
the organization.</P>
      <P>The children on Taiwan will benefit from WHO service, and the
world health organization can benefit from Taiwan's membership,
Brown said.</P>
      <P>Brown pointed out that political intervention by mainland China
has prevented Taiwan from making financial and technological
contributions to WHO-sponsored activities in recent years.</P>
      <P>Continued denial of Taiwan's request to join the WHO is a
violation of the basic rights of the people on Taiwan without any
reason, and is an incomprehensible act of overlooking the benefit
Taiwan's WHO membership cab bring to Taiwan and the whole world.</P>

      <P>Responding to questions from reporters following an appearance at

to his departure.</P>
      <P>Describing his recent South Korean visit as fruitful, Chang said
he met leaders from a broad social spectrum there and discussed
issues of mutual concern with them. He said South Korea has high
appraisals of Taiwan's performance in the recent financial crisis
plaguing the Asian region and called on the people of Taiwan to
support government policies.</P>
      <P>Chang said he will propose measures to increase bilateral ties
with South Korea to pave the way for a warming of two-way relations.</P>

learn from the experience.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a Lunar New Year and Hari Raya dinner at his

      <P>If there are mis-steps or mishaps and unexpected events occur,

      <P>Singapore must do whatever it can to help its neighbors restore

      <P>Lee cited two factors which could affect the region and Singapore
severely.</P>
      <P>First, although mainland China has not been affected by the

    <HEADLINE>SEACEN URGED TO FOCUS ON MACROECONOMIC STABILITY</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Bank Indonesia Governor Sudradjat
Djiwandono has underlined the need for member countries of the
Southeast Asian Central Banks Association (SEACEN) to focus their
attention on macroeconomic stability.</P>
      <P>This can be achieved by bolstering regional cooperation in
maintaining economic and monetary stability, Sudradjat was quoted by
Antara news agency as saying at the conclusion of the 33rd Conference
of Asian Central Bank Governors in Nusa Dua, Bali, on Saturday night.</P>
      <P>The SEACEN conference in Bali was attended by 41 delegates from
ten central banks, including Taiwan's Central Bank of China, Bank
Negara Malaysia, Bank of Korea, Bank of Thailand, Central Bank of
Myanmar, Nepal Rastra Bank, Monetary Authority of Singapore, Central
Bank of Sri Lanka, and the host Bank Indonesia.</P>
      <P>Also present were observers from the National Bank of Cambodia,
Reserve Bank of Fiji and the Reserve Bank of Tonga.</P>
      <P>Dhiwandono said the forum plays a crucial role in facilitating an
active cooperation policy and joint supervision to promote stability
within a freer capital market scheme.</P>
      <P>He said the problems faced by a particular country in an
increasingly integrated international environment are not isolated.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Thai Central Bank Governor Chaiyawat Wibulswasdi
pointed out that the task of a central bank is to restore credibility
and confidence.</P>
      <P>To that end, he said, clear-cut and sustainable actions and a
strong determination are needed. While the process for doing this
might be very difficult and painful, and demands great sacrifice,
Chaiyawat said he was optimistic that his country would overcome the
adverse effects of its monetary crisis.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Bank for International Settlements Managing Director
Andrew Crockett said in his address on monetary stability and
international capital movement that even countries with strong
economic fundamentals could fall victim to a sudden loss of public
confidence.</P>
      <P>He also said that a country with a sound macro policy would need
to adjust to a constantly changing environment.</P>
      <P>"Those who fail in making such adjustments on time will get
serious consequences," he said.</P>
      <P>He also suggested that liberalization in a domestic monetary
system and openness to the international capital market have to be
matched with more reliable and firmer policies as well as better
control.</P>
      <P>The SEACEN conference is an annual meeting of Asian central bank
governors held on a rotating basis in the member countries. South
Korea is expected to host next year's 34th SEACEN conference.</P>
      <P>SEACEN is a consultative and regional cooperation forum of
central banks and monetary authorities in the Southeast Asian region.
It is aimed at promoting matters of common interest, particularly in

(By Jane Huang &amp; Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>World-renown investment expert George
Soros has no plans to visit Taiwan in the near future, a spokesman
for the billionaire American financier said here Saturday.</P>
      <P>He did not deny, however, that investment managers from the
Quantum Group of Funds, the forward player of the Soros Fund
Management corporation, have made a series of visits to that island
to call on locally listed companies.</P>
      <P>The spokesman made the remarks in response to questions from CNA
over recent reports that a large amount of money from the Quantum
Fund N.V., the oldest and largest fund with the group, has recently
poured into the Taiwan stock market, especially in the high-tech
sectors. Confidence in the Taiwan Stock Exchange has gradually
rallied in the past several weeks following a decline resulting from
Asia's regional financial troubles.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, the spokesman refused to reveal whether the group's
funds will make their way into the emerging market. Nor would he
comment on its assessment of the prospects for Taiwan technology
shares, citing confidential business strategy.</P>
      <P>The spokesman merely stated that his boss has devoted his
attention to charitable causes over the past eight years while
leaving the burden of his business operations on the shoulders of
managing executives. Thus, he said, Soros himself rarely makes
"inspection tours" of potential investment markets.</P>
      <P>Soros Fund Management, employing 21 elite investment consultants
and more than 100 support personnel, currently possesses total assets
valued at over US$18 billion. Its Quantum Fund is generally
recognized as having the best performance record of any investment
fund in the world since its founding in 1969.</P>
      <P>Other funds under the Quantum Group include the Qussar
International Fund N.V., Quantum Emerging Growth Fund N.V. and Quata
Fund N.V., according to the company.</P>
      <P>Soros has been a controversial figure in the world's financial
markets. Criticism of the tycoon's role in Asian monetary and stock
markets, which suffered severe damage from last year's financial
turmoil, has increased following his assistance to South Korea in
helping that country avoid bankruptcy.</P>

    <HEADLINE>QUEBEC PREMIER CLAIMS OTTAWA CREATING POLITICAL CRISIS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  Feb.  14  (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Quebec Premier Lucien Bouchard warned
Saturday that Ottawa is creating a political crisis by going ahead
with its plan to ask the Supreme Court of Canada for an opinion on
the legality of unilateral declaration of independence by Quebec.</P>
      <P>Bouchard wants the Supreme Court to "refuse to hear the case,"
claiming the matter is a political, not legal, issue. His central
argument is that Quebec's political future should be decided by the
people, not by the court.</P>
      <P>If the Supreme Court goes ahead, as requested by Jean Chretien's
Liberal government, there will be "political consequences" --
suffering a blow to its credibility as well as creating new tensions,
Bouchard said. The court is to begin hearing the case on Monday.</P>
      <P>It will "exacerbate the political tensions and, of course, it
will add up to the political crisis," he warned.</P>
      <P>Besides boycotting the court proceedings, Quebec sovereigntists
will bring their case to foreign envoys stationed in Ottawa. Bouchard
said they plan to tell the foreign ambassadors that most Quebecers do
not want the court to interfere in their future.</P>
      <P>"I think that the foreign countries' ambassadors have to know not
all people in Quebec and in Canada share the distorted view of
democracy of the federal government," Bouchard added.</P>
      <P>The Chretien government has asked the Supreme Court to answer
three questions: Can Quebec unilaterally secede under the Canadian
constitution? Does it have the right under international law? In a
conflict between domestic and international law, which takes
precedence?</P>
      <P>For all intents and purposes, these are questions involving the
rule of law and ones which anyone professing to be a democrat must
deal with. But Quebec's sovereigntists, knowing they will almost
certainly lose the case in the court, have refused to participate in
the court debate.</P>
      <P>Instead, they shifted the focus from the legal to the political
aspect, claiming those are questions for the people to decide, and
not the nine judges in the court. Canada's "unity minister," Stephane
Dion, conceded he has a "major challenge" in countering the argument
of the Bouchard camp.</P>
      <P>As this is the first time such a sensitive case has been brought
up to the Supreme Court, nobody has dared to predict what will
happen. Analysts are unsure whether or not the court will answer
these questions. Most are confident, though, that a court decision
will not come soon.</P>

      <P>Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong
said on Saturday he will try to find a "new base" to forge closer
cooperation between Singapore and Malaysia during upcoming talks with
Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad in Kuala Lumpur.</P>
      <P>Asked what issues will be brought up during the two-day meeting
in Kuala Lumpur beginning on Monday, he was quoted as saying: "I
would not want to approach it on an issues basis. It's generally to
see whether we can find a new base for us to forge closer
cooperation.</P>
      <P>"So I go up with a positive outlook. Not to think there are
problems to be solved, but how we can work together."</P>
      <P>Still, the regional economic crisis will be top of the agenda.</P>
      <P>"There's a crisis going on, and we've got to try and see how we
can help resolve the regional crisis. That's the main rationale for
my going up. But beyond that, it's always good between neighbors to
see one another from time to time," he was quoted as saying.</P>
      <P>The two leaders have already met twice so far this year.</P>
      <P>On Jan. 20, they met in Johor, Malaysia, at the Sebana golf
resort. During the 90-minute meeting, they discussed the regional
currency crisis and bilateral relations.</P>
      <P>They continued these discussions when they met again in Singapore
on Feb. 7.</P>
      <P>Monday's meeting will be Goh's first official visit to the
Malaysian capital since 1994.</P>
      <P>The Straits Times reported earlier that Mahathir had said that he
was open to negotiating a new water-supply agreement with Singapore,
one which must not put Malaysia at a disadvantage.</P>
      <P>He had also said that Malaysia would not turn off the water
supply to Singapore when the current agreement ends in 2061.</P>
      <P>Asked about the water issue on Saturday, Goh was quoted as
saying: "I read this in the paper, that we would discuss water. There
are other issues which we will discuss as well."</P>
      <P>The prime minister was speaking to reporters during a community
event at his Marine Parade constituency.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, according to a report from Malaysia's Bernama news
agency on Saturday, Mahathir said he would discuss with Goh about
"better relations" between the two countries when they meet in Kuala
Lumpur.</P>
      <P>"We just want to discuss how to get over all these problems we
have and to have better relations," he was quoted as telling
reporters who had asked him about the meeting.</P>

(By Maurus Young)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The deputy director-general of the
Geneva-based World Trade Organization (WTO) said that Beijing is in
its final stage before joining the WTO," according to reports of the
world trade body on Saturday.</P>
      <P>"I believe we can say that the process has entered its final
phase," Kim Chul-su was quoted by the WTO report as saying.</P>
      <P>"The process of (mainland) Chinese accession that began more than
10 years ago has recently gathered momentum and direction. There has
been renewed determination on all sides to secure China's entry into
the WTO as soon as possible on commercially viable terms."</P>
      <P>Kim, a former South Korean minister of trade, industry and
energy, said that conditions for mainland China had improved with its
market opening initiatives.</P>
      <P>He said Beijing and WTO members are now engaged in intensive and
focused bilateral market-access negotiations.</P>
      <P>"My impression is that we are very close to the successful
conclusion of the negotiations," Kim was quoted as saying.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP HEAVYWEIGHT PROPOSES 'CHINESE FINANCIAL GROUP'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  15  (CNA)
(By Bear Lee)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A heavyweight member of the opposition
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) on Sunday proposed the
establishment of a Chinese financial organization, grouping Taiwan,
mainland China, Hong Kong and Singapore.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Chang Chun-hung said during a debate on the
party's policy toward mainand China that the financial crisis which
has embroiled most of the countries in Southeast Asia is turning
worse and that it is poised to become a "disaster" for all nations in
the region within three to six months.</P>
      <P>He suggested the four Chinese economies -- Taiwan, the mainland,
Hong Kong and Singapore -- which so far have suffered only a slight
impact from the economic turmoil, hold a joint conference for the
purpose of establishing a formal "Chinese Financial Group" in order
to weather the turbulence.</P>
      <P>Beijing's refusal to join the group would only expose its
hegemonic manner, Chang said.</P>
      <P>However, the proposal by Chang, who represents the DPP's
mainstream Formosa group, was rebutted by delegates from the party's
other factions.</P>
      <P>Legislator Chang Chun-hsiung called the suggestion an "admirable
but unfeasible political concept" which sees cross-strait trade as a
bargaining chip with mainland China but ignores Taiwan's security.</P>
      <P>Legislator Chai Trong R. said that Taiwan's joining such a group
would be tantamount to "surrendering" to Beijing because it would
undermine Taiwan's sovereignty.</P>
      <P>The three-day session, aimed at forging a consensus among the DPP
factions on the party's policy toward the mainland, drew to an end in
the afternoon.</P>
      <P>Former DPP Chairman Shih Ming-teh on the sideline of the forum
proposed on Friday the formation of a "Greater Chinese Commonwealth"
to normalize relations between Taiwan and mainland China.</P>
      <P>According to Prof. Yang Kai-huang of Soochow University, Beijing
should take serious note of the DPP forum and map out strategies for
dealing with the opposition party, which is growing in strength and
stands poised to challenge the Kuomintang as Taiwan's ruling party.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PROVINCIAL COUNCIL SET TO REVIEW BAYER CASE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  15  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The NT$50 billion investment plan by the
Germany-based Bayer Group to set up a production plant for toluene
di-isocyanate (TDI) in central Taichung Harbor is expected to gain a
new lease of life, as the Taiwan Provincial Assembly is set to review
the matter during its next session.</P>
      <P>Sources familiar with the case said that discussion on the land
lease contract by Bayer is expected to be put on the agenda of the
provincial council's 14th temporary session, which will begin on
Monday and run through Feb. 27, as most provincial councilors have
shown support for the project.</P>
      <P>The sources said they are optimistic about eventual passage of
the land lease contract for Bayer, which will give the group a legal
basis to start construction of relevant facilities on a site owned by
the Taiwan Provincial Assembly near Taichung Harbor in central
Taichung County.</P>
      <P>The chemical giant announced in December that it was relocating
the long-delayed TDI investment plan to the United States, as the
project had encountered strong opposition from local residents over
fears that it would cause environmental pollution.</P>
      <P>However, Bayer showed a willingness to return to Taiwan last week
after a fact-finding delegation composed of Republic of China
officials, local experts and opinion leaders from Taichung County
visited its headquarters in Dormagen, Germany.</P>
      <P>The German firm told the delegation that it is willing to retain
the plan in Taiwan as long as the Taiwan Provincial Assembly approves
its land lease contract by the end of this month to pave the way for
construction of its production facilities in Taichung Harbor by
September.</P>
      <P>In an effort to woo back Bayer, the central government has been
actively coordinating with the provincial council in the hope that it
will call a temporary session in the middle of this month to review
the Bayer case.</P>
      <P>P.K. Chiang, chairman of the Cabinet-level Council for Economic
Planning and Development (CEPD), will hold a seminar in Taichung City
on Monday to explain Bayer's plan to the public, underscoring the
importance attached by the central government to the project.</P>
      <P>According to the CEPD, the Bayer's TDI plant, the first foreign
investment plan presented to the ROC government in line with its bid
to build Taiwan into an Asia-Pacific operations hub, will bring
considerable economic gain to local communities.</P>
      <P>Its first-phase, NT$11.5 billion investment alone will create
NT$126 billion in economic benefits over 20 years, in addition to the
profits created by the following two phases, the CEPD said. The
council added that Bayer has also promised to hire local workers and
register the company with the Taichung County government in order to
pay taxes directly to the local authorities.</P>
      <P>Currently, there are only eight companies in the world capable of
producing TDI, a material essential for the production of the
high-end PU, and Bayer holds the largest stake of 27 percent in the
global market.</P>
      <P>As annual demand for TDI in Asia has been estimated at 350,000
metric tons for the year 2000, Bayer has set the first-phase annual
output for its Taichung production plant at 100,000 metric tons,
which industry sources said will pave the way for Bayer to become the
region's leading supplier of TDI.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, a public opinion survey released recently by the
Taichung County government showed that 47 percent of the local
residents are opposed to the Bayer investment plan, while 26 percent
are in favor of the project. But more than 50 percent of the people
do not know what type of product Bayer will manufacture at its
Taichung plant.</P>
      <P>The central government has repeatedly said that it will do its
best to push for the passage of the project, as it will play a vital
role in Taiwan's continued economic development and carry great
symbolic importance for other foreign companies planning to invest in
Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NEW PARTY MISSION VISITS MAINLAND CROSS-STRAIT AFFAIRS CHIEF</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  15  (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China will open its arms for a
visit by Koo Chen-fu, chairman of Taipei's Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF), a high-ranking Beijing official in charge of
cross-strait affairs was quoted as saying.</P>
      <P>Chen Yunlin, director of the mainland's Taiwan Affairs Office
under the State Council, made the remarks in Beijing on Friday during
a meeting with a visiting delegation from Taiwan's opposition New
Party.</P>
      <P>Chen told the 25-member group from Taiwan's third largest
political party that he hopes the Taipei-Beijing talks will be
resumed as soon as possible under the "one China" principle. He added
that bilateral dialogue on matters of substance can begin following
the opening of political negotiations, according to the delegation's
press release on the meeting issued Sunday.</P>
      <P>In response to Taiwan's urging that cross-strait talks should be
"re-opened from where they left off," which implies that technical
issues between the two sides should be the major agenda item of
resumed negotiations, Chen said there is no need to confine the
dialogue because "things are always changing."</P>
      <P>Cross-strait talks were unilaterally suspended by Beijing in 1995
in protest at Republic of China President Lee Teng-hui's visit to the
United States in June that year.</P>
      <P>As for recent personnel shifts in the SEF, the mainland official
made no detailed comment, merely expressing reserved optimism and
hope that Shi Hwei-you, new SEF secretary-general and vice chairman
who will be the top negotiator for Taiwan in future talks, will
contribute to lessening the current state of antagonism between the
two sides.</P>
      <P>The SEF is a semi-official intermediary body founded by ROC
authorities in 1991 to handle cross-strait exchanges in the absence
of official dialogue channels.</P>
      <P>The New Party delegation departed Taipei on Monday for an
eight-day visit to the mainland under the first invitation ever
extended by the Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Strait (ARATS) to a Taiwan political party since the release
of mainland President Jiang Zemin's "eight-point statement" in
January 1995.</P>
      <P>On Saturday, the group, which has described itself as "the voice
of the Taiwan people," called on ARATS Vice Chairman Tang Shubei in
Beijing, who expressed "cautious optimism" over the resumption of
cross-strait talks, according to another news release issued by the
New Party delegation from Shanghai, where they arrived on Saturday.</P>
      <P>It said Tang called on the two sides to engage in more frequent
communications and to greater better efforts in advancing mutual
understanding. He said that concerns expressed by the Taiwan side
could be included on the agenda of the first round of discussions in
order to reduce its doubts over the mainland's demand that political
negotiations be conducted under the "one China" principle, which is
defined by Beijing as the People's Republic of China being the sole
legal government of China, with Taiwan being a province of China.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is governed by the Republic of China, which recognizes
that China has been divided since 1949 and is currently ruled by two
separate governments, whereby two equitable political entities
coexist under the concept of "one China."</P>
      <P>Based on this concept, the Taiwan side has demanded equal
treatment in the handling of cross-strait political issues.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIPEI MAYOR MUM ON REPORTED US VISIT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  16  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Chen Shui-bian on Monday
denied reports that arrangements are being made for a US visit and a
private meeting with Vice President Al Gore.</P>
      <P>Chen, however, said he would like to visit Washington if given an
opportunity.</P>
      <P>Chen was answering reporters' questions about a Japanese
newspaper report on Sunday that the Taipei mayor is planning to visit
the United States in mid-March, during which time he would meet with
ranking US government and political leaders, including Vice President
Gore.</P>
      <P>In a report filed from Taipei, the Nihon Keizai Shimbun said
Chen, widely expected to be the candidate for Taiwan's opposition
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in the next presidential election,
will use the trip to exchange views with US officials and politicians
on mainland Chinese and Taiwan affairs. A meeting with Gore is also
being arranged, the paper said.</P>
      <P>The report noted that the DPP, with its political clout on the
rise, is seen by Washington as likely to play an important role in
future relations between Taiwan and mainland China.</P>
      <P>The Japanese daily, however, pointed out that tension across the
Taiwan Strait may escalate in the event the pro-independence DPP wins
the presidential election or becomes the ruling party on Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Ma Yung-cheng, a Taipei City Government spokesman, denied on
Sunday evening that Chen had mentioned either a March visit to the
United States or a possible meeting with Gore during an interview he
gave with the Nihon Keizai Shimbun last week.</P>
      <P>Ma admitted that Richard Bush, chairman of the American Institute
in Taiwan (AIT), had extended an invitation to Chen during a recent
visit to the Taipei City Hall. The AIT represents US interests in
Taiwan in the absence of formal diplomatic relations between Taipei
and Washington.</P>
      <P>Ma said although the mayor had verbally accepted Bush's
invitation to visit the United States, relevant arrangements are
still under planning and nothing is finalized yet.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that the DPP is scheduled to hold intraparty
primaries in March to choose candidates for mayoral races in Taipei
and Kaohsiung, city council seats in the two metropolitan areas as
well as national-level legislative elections, further lowering the
possibility of Chen's departure in mid-March for the United States.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 16 (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China's Ministry of Railways will
lay off 1.1 million workers in various sections under its
administration within the next three years, in order to cut a huge
deficit in its operations.</P>
      <P>The deficit incurred by mainland Chinese railway operations has
accumulated to 22 billion Chinese yuan, according to the Sunday
edition of the Hong Kong-based Wen Wei Bao.</P>
      <P>In addition, the newspaper added that a new trend is looming
which could deal a further blow to the development of the railway
system in mainland China. That is the fact that highway and air
transportation is gradually replacing railroads as the backbone of
mainland China's internal transportation network.</P>
      <P>During the traditional busy season of the Lunar New Year
holidays, official statistics show that the total passenger load on
the mainland's transportation systems increased 4.8 percent in 1997
over that of 1996; however, passengers on the nation's railways
decreased 1.5 percent in the same period.</P>
      <P>Personnel costs account for one-third of the total expenditures
of mainland railway operations, which makes the impending layoffs
appear to be the only effective approach to raising the
competitiveness of the rail system, the daily said.</P>

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Taiwan group intending to make a tour of
the expressway project at Hong Kong's new airport this week was
forced to cancel the trip Monday after its members were unable to
obtain visas from Hong Kong authorities.</P>
      <P>According to sources from the Ministry of Transportation and
Communications (MOTC), the 13-member Taipei delegation, headed by
Vice Transportation and Communications Minister Chen Shih-chi, was
effectively barred from entering Hong Kong without any explanation
from officials there.</P>
      <P>Chen and his team, which also included Deputy Taiwan Governor Wu
Jung-ming, President Group Chairman Kao Chin-yen, and several
officials from the MOTC's High Speed Rail Bureau, are members of a
screening committee for work on a proposed mass rapid transport (MRT)
system linking Chiang Kai-shek International Airport and the Taipei
MRT system.</P>
      <P>They were scheduled to depart for Hong Kong on Monday for a
fact-finding tour of the new Chek Lap Kok airport where they hoped to
familiarize themselves with advanced rail and expressway systems at
the airport complex which link that facility with the existing Kai
Tak international airport in Kowloon.</P>
      <P>High Speed Rail Bureau officials explained that the visit was
arranged because some of the engineering proposals offered by bidders
on the CKS Airport-Taipei Railway Station MRT Project are the same as
those being incorporated into the Hong Kong new airport.</P>
      <P>However, the officials said that since visas were not issued in
time by Hong Kong authorities, the visit by the screening committee
members would be canceled and that there are no plans to reschedule
the trip.</P>
      <P>The US$20.3 billion Chek Lap Kok airport, the world's largest
infrastructure project, is due to be completed by April this year.
Designed to replace the outmoded Kai Tak international airport, Chek
Lap Kok will be able to handle 35 million passengers and 3 million

    <HEADLINE>ROC TO PARTIALLY OPEN FARMING MARKET BEFORE WTO ENTRY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 16 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan will partially open its agricultural
market as a "down payment" for entry to the Geneva-based World Trade
Organization (WTO), the Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture (COA)
confirmed on Monday.</P>
      <P>"We'll allow limited imports of some agricultural products before
we are formally admitted to the world trade regulatory body," COA
Vice Chairman Lee Chien-chuan said, adding that the move is aimed at
finalizing bilateral WTO talks with Taiwan's most important trade
partner, the United States, as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The WTO does not set detailed terms for "down payments" by any
membership applicant, but such offers can help narrow differences in
the entry terms negotiation process, Lee explained.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Lee would not reveal the list of agricultural
products or the quota for those items Taiwan plans to allow for
import ahead of its WTO accession.</P>
      <P>"Negotiations with the US are still going on. Nobody knows the
outcome at the moment," Lee said. "We'll remain flexible and prudent
in the procedures."</P>
      <P>Government sources said the COA had discussed various "down
payment" proposals with local agricultural and husbandry associations
before the current round of Taiwan-US WTO talks opened in Washington,
D.C. last week.</P>
      <P>The COA has drafted import quotas and tariff rates for such
sensitive products as pork, chicken meat and animal intestines, but
which items will ultimately be selected for pre-WTO entry market
opening, annual import quotas and tariff rates remains uncertain, the
sources said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan currently bans imports of chicken meat, intestines of
chickens and pigs as well as pork bellies, but allow imports of
top-quality pork, which is subject to a tariff rate of 15 percent.</P>
      <P>Agricultural issues have been the crux of Taiwan-US WTO talks.
Reports from Washington said the two sides have almost come to terms
on insurance and service industry topics, but are still divided on
farm trade and compact car import issues after six days of intensive
consultations.</P>
      <P>According to the reports, the US side has demanded that Taiwan
lower the local-content rate for compact cars from the current 50
percent to 40 percent before its WTO accession and cancel
preferential commodity tax rates for locally developed engines,
chassises and auto designs. The United States has also asked Taiwan
to speed up its tariff reduction timetables for some other industrial
products. The two sides will continue negotiating compact car issues
as well as pork, animal intestine and rice import matters in the next
few days.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, ROC Economics Minister Wang Chih-kang arrived in
Washington on Sunday in preparation to seek major breakthroughs in
the difficult WTO talks.</P>
      <P>Wang is scheduled to meet with US Deputy Trade Representative
Richard Fisher on Tuesday for talks on some policy issues related to
Taiwan's WTO entry terms. US Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky
will join the bilateral policy talks on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has so far held 17 rounds of WTO-related talks with the
United States. Both sides hope the current round will resolve all
thorny issues and put an end to the lengthy negotiations.</P>

(By Maurus Young)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>"Good governance is the only real
protection" in any financial crisis, according to Thomas L. Friedman,
a noted financial analyst.</P>
      <P>Contributing an article to the Paris-based mass-circulation
International Herald Tribune, Friedman pointed out: "Of those Asian
nations which were fully plugged into the market, those with the most
noncorrupt, transparent and accountable financial systems -- Taiwan,
Hong Kong, Singapore -- have been hurt the least. Those that had
democratic, but corrupt, systems -- Thailand and South Korea -- were
hurt the second worst, but at least have been able to respond quickly
by voting in better governance."</P>
      <P>"The country that is going to melt down is Indonesia. Its
corrupt, authoritarian regime can't adapt," Friedman said.</P>
      <P>"If your domestic institutions are strong, then you don't need
very strong global institutions. If domestic institutions inside
countries are weak, it won't matter how strong your global
institutions are. They will not be effective," Friedman quoted Bob
Hormats, vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International, as saying in
his article.</P>
      <P>"Democracy does not guarantee that you will never have an
economic crisis. We know that. Markets overshoot. Investors take
crazy risks," Friedman said.</P>
      <P>"But the more democratic, accountable and open your governance,
especially as an emerging market, the less likely it is that your
financial system will be exposed to surprises, the easier it will be
for you to improve and adapt when it is, and the more legitimacy your
government will have to share the pain when change is required," he

    <TEXT>
      <P>Pressures from the international community
have started to mount on Cambodia to hold a fair, credible and free
election in July of this year or face possible sanctions.</P>
      <P>Philippine Foreign Affairs Secretary Domingo Siazon, in a press
conference at the Manila Hotel, said that the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the Friends of Cambodia (FOC)
resolved that the scheduled elections in Cambodia on July 26 are
crucial to its international standing as a nation.</P>
      <P>Siazon, chairman of the ASEAN Standing Committee, held a
three-hour consultative meeting with Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali
Alatas and Thai Foreign Minister Surin Pitsuwan, the so-called "ASEAN
Troika," with representatives from the 12-member FOC at the Manila
Hotel on Sunday to discuss the Cambodian issue.</P>
      <P>The foreign secretary stated that all countries present during
the meeting, had urged that free, fair and credible elections be held
in July in order that the standing of Phnom Penh as a member of the
world community will not be unduly affected.</P>
      <P>Pitsuwan said in an interview that members of the FOC have
expressed the possibility of cutting aid, financial or otherwise, if
Cambodia fails to hold credible elections this year.</P>
      <P>"The Friends of Cambodia expressed their desire to see the
election take place as scheduled (because) the elections are a vital
step in the restoration of peace and political stability in Cambodia
and that the key issue for the credibility of the electoral process
is that of participation. If the issue of participation is not
resolved, the Friends of Cambodia would have to individually review
their continuing assistance for the electoral process," the FOC said
in a statement.</P>
      <P>The ASEAN Troika, tasked to assist Cambodia to achieve a stable
government in lieu of its membership in ASEAN, is in close
coordination with the members of the FOC to discuss pressing
developments in that country.</P>
      <P>Cambodia was supposed to join ASEAN in July last year together
with Myanmar and Laos when Second Prime Minister Hun Sen, alleging
acts of treason, launched a coup that deposed the First Prime
Minister Norodom Ranariddh, son of Cambodia's head of state, King
Norodom Sihanouk.</P>
      <P>In a consensus decision, ASEAN decided to defer Cambodia's
membership, pending efforts to normalize the situation in the country
and enable Phnom Penh to meet certain prescribed requirements, one of
which was the holding of elections, before it can be allowed to
formally enter the international organization as a full member.</P>
      <P>Among the FOC members which took part in the meeting were
Austria, Canada, mainland China, France, Germany, Japan, Korea, New
Zealand, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States. UN
Representative to Cambodia Lakhan Mehrota also attended the meeting.</P>
      <P>Siazon explained that the FOC is an informal group which is
directly interested in developments in Cambodia based on its member
countries' various ties with Phnom Penh.</P>
      <P>The group is scheduled to meet again in the Philippines on March
6 to review developments relating to the assessments made at Sunday's
meeting.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FRESH RIOTS HIT WEST JAVA SUBDISTRICT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Jakarta,  Feb.  16  (CNA)
(By Wu Pin Chiang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A riot triggered by price hikes hit the
West Java subdistrict of Kadipaten in Majalenka regency, 10
kilometers east of Bandung, on Sunday, as other towns remained tense.</P>
      <P>Dozens of people began to take to the streets at midday,
attacking shops and settling them ablaze. At least 15 shops were
damaged, with six of them -- plus several motorcycles -- being set on
fire.</P>
      <P>Security authorities quickly restored order and arrested two men
suspected of sparking the unrest. There was no report of injuries
during the 40-minute police clampdown, the Jakarta Post reported.</P>
      <P>In Cerebon, minor rioting erupted in Karansembung village just
hours before Governor R. Nuriana toured the town to inspect the
village after rioting on Friday. The latest outbreak left two houses
burned.</P>
      <P>Nuriana visited people in Ceribon's riot-hit areas of Lemah
Abang, Pasar Gebang, Losari and Cileduk who were clearing remnants of
buildings attacked by angry rioters over the past few days.</P>
      <P>The coastal town had yet to return to normal on Sunday, with many
shops staying closed and major bus terminals witnessing a sharp
decline of passengers leaving the town. Instead, people seemingly
preferred to travel by train as evidenced by increased numbers of
travelers at the railway station.</P>
      <P>Violence also spilled over into Purwokerto in Central Java on
Sunday when several people stoned buses heading for the coastal areas
of Banyumas, Pemalang, Brebes and Cilacap, all in Central Java.</P>
      <P>Antara news agency reported that the attack caused buses and
other forms of public transportation to suspend services out of fears
that riots would resume. Hundreds of residents were left stranded for
hours due to the absence of transportation.</P>
      <P>Tension also reigned in the Central Java town of Purbalingga as
hundreds of people pelted shops which sell basic commodities because
their owners refused to open. But the military and police managed to
immediately thwart any potential rioting. They made no arrests, only
ordering the angry people to return home.</P>
      <P>Bandung was calmer on Sunday, despite rumors that strikes and
riots were about to erupt. The rumors affected public transportation,
forcing groups of people to wait for hours for public minibuses.</P>
      <P>More troops were seen patrolling the town despite heavy rain
throughout the day.</P>
      <P>Governor Nuriana called on entrepreneurs and public
transportation drivers to resume their business activities as usual
to prevent public anxiety from worsening.</P>
      <P>"Most riots were triggered by a lack of public transportation.
People tend to gather. And once this happens, they can be easily
driven to rioting," Nuriana said.</P>
      <P>Earlier, Central Java Governor Soewardi accused a certain group
based in Jakarta of organizing the riots that had rocked the province
and other town across Java.</P>
      <P>"We found that some people we arrested for allegedly inciting
riots came from Jakarta. They arrived here along with the exodus of
Idul Fitri revelers," Suwardi said over the weekend.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ARMED FORCES SET TO BACK HABIBIE AS INDONESIAN VICE PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore, Feb. 16 (CNA)
(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Indonesia's armed forces (ABRI) look set
to support Research and Technology Minister B.J. Habibie as the
country's next vice president, The Straits Times reported Monday in a
dispatch from Jakarta.</P>
      <P>Military sources in Jakarta told the Singapore-based daily that
the armed forces was leaning towards Habibie after a consensus was
reached among various ABRI factions at a three-day annual meeting of
commanders last week.</P>
      <P>"We have agreed to back Dr. Habibie because that is what Pak
Harto wants," a senior ABRI officer involved in the deliberations was
quoted as saying in reference to Indonesian President Suharto.</P>
      <P>"We have also agreed if the president changes his mind and
appoints someone else at the eleventh hour, we will support his
choice."</P>
      <P>The deputy speaker of parliament and ABRI parliamentary faction
head, Lt. Gen. Syarwan Hamid, also alluded to this possibility on
Saturday, saying that the military had named only one person as its
vice presidential candidate, the report said.</P>
      <P>Asked if this was Habibie, he replied: "You may be right. There
will be no changes in the armed forces' decision."</P>
      <P>The comments of these high-ranking officers take place against a
background of growing support for the 61-year-old German-trained
engineer and close confidant of Suharto, who had given the broadest
hint that Habibie was his choice after presenting a list of criteria
which a vice president must possess, the report said.</P>
      <P>That message seems to have permeated downwards, the report noted.</P>
      <P>The ruling Golkar party said last week that it was backing
Habibie along with parliamentary speaker Harmoko for the vice
presidency.</P>
      <P>Habibie has also received backing from the Muslim-based United
Development Party and the Indonesian Democratic Party, the report
said.</P>
      <P>Conventional thinking in Jakarta has been that ABRI would be more
comfortable with a military figure in the No. 2 post, with some
backing incumbent Gen. Try Sutrisno as its candidate, it said.</P>
      <P>Many younger officers have been resentful of Habibie's efforts to
take away strategic industries and procurement decisions from them,
with the result that he now has a bigger say in what equipment is
purchased and from where, the report said.</P>
      <P>Indeed, it pointed out, in the run-up to the 1993 People's
Consultative Assembly, observers said that the military took the
unusual step of supporting Try as its vice presidential candidate,
fearing that Suharto would nominate Habibie or even retain then Vice
President Sudharmono for another term.</P>
      <P>Sources said that the military was unlikely to pull off a similar
stunt, the report said. Noted a senior officer: "It is wishful
thinking for us to go against the president's wishes. The ABRI of
1993 is very different from today's ABRI."</P>
      <P>Habibie's fortunes appeared to have taken a temporary dip last
week with the replacement of his close ally, military chief Feisal
Tanjung, by Gen. Wiranto, who is known to distance himself from
Islamic forces and from supporting Golkar outright, the report said.</P>
      <P>But military insiders said that Habibie's star was still shining
given countervailing support for him from other key military figures,
including Suharto's son-in-law, Maj. Gen. Prabowo Subianto, who was
promoted recently from head of the Special Forces to lead the Army
Strategic Reserve Command, the report said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan business migrants are expected to
play an active role in forming bilateral ties between the Republic of
China and Australia, analysts say.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Chamber of Commerce in Australia (TCCA) held its
inaugural meeting and party at the Sydney Townhall on Friday in which
450 guests, including former opposition leader John Hewson,
Australian Labor Party members of Parliament and businessmen from
Taiwan and Australia took part.</P>
      <P>The TCCA comprises Taiwan businessmen based in Queensland,
Victoria, New South Wales, Western and Southern Australia and
currently has more than 80 members.</P>
      <P>Australian analysts said they believe the TCCA will serve as a
bridge in improving the already good ties between Australia and
Taiwan, not only in trade and investment, but also in cultural and
educational, sports and other fields.</P>
      <P>"We believe TCCA will play an active role in the improvement of
trade and investment between Australia and Taiwan. It will also help
increase other ties. Therefore, the establishment of TCCA is
significant because it will have a far-reaching impact in boosting
bilateral ties between the two countries," one analyst said.</P>
      <P>Liu Po-lun, representative of the Taipei Economic and Cultural
Office in Canberra, gave his blessing to the establishment of the
TCCA and wished the chamber success in its endeavors.</P>
      <P>Bilateral trade between Taiwan and Australia totaled about A$6
billion in 1997, up slightly from the previous year. Investment
between the two countries, however, has lagged behind the trade
figures.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIPEI MAYOR PRAISES DPP DEBATE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  16  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Chen Shui-bian of the major
opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) on Monday hailed the
party's three-day debate on mainland policy, saying consensus reached
on the issue will help the DPP take a big step towards coming to
power in the central government.</P>
      <P>Chen, who did not attend the debate, said he appreciated DPP
Chairman Hsu Hsin-liang's adjustment and compromise in his "go west"
policy, which he said made it possible for different factions within
the party to reach consensus on its mainland policy.</P>
      <P>The pro-independence DPP has long been criticized for lacking a
clear policy toward mainland China, especially if it hopes to become
Taiwan's ruling party.</P>
      <P>Chen also expressed delight that the debate drew a great deal of
attention from society and that it served to show that the DPP is a
democratic, progressive, flexible and responsible political party.</P>
      <P>However, Chen stressed that the result will not affect the DPP's
basic stance of advocating a public referendum to decide the future
of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Hsu said on Sunday at a news conference following the close of
the three-day gathering that the debate has enhanced solidarity
within the DPP and that the agreements reached in the debate will be
submitted to the central standing committee as references for the
party's future policymaking on mainland China.</P>
      <P>Hsu expressed the belief that the DPP will gain greater support
in the year-end mayoral elections in Taipei and Kaohsiung cities if
the party can work out a practical policy for dealing with mainland
China.</P>
      <P>Despite the fact that a number of differences remain among the
various party factions, DPP Secretary-General Chiou I-jen lined out
the major agreements as follows:</P>
      <P>-- Taiwan and mainland China should conduct negotiations.</P>
      <P>-- the DPP stands firm on its principle of Taiwan's sovereignty,
and the issue cannot be used as a bargaining chip in negotiations
with the mainland.</P>
      <P>-- to adopt a comprehensive and flexible strategy in negotiations
with mainland China, which can include trade and commercial ties and
technical issues.</P>
      <P>-- to upgrade Taiwan's industrial sector and engage cautiously
with mainland China on the economic front.</P>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The largest sarcophagus ever found in
Taiwan was unearthed in Ilan County, northeastern Taiwan over the
weekend, according to a local researcher.</P>
      <P>Liu Yi-chang, a researcher at the Institute of History and
Philology of Taiwan's highest-level academic institution, Academia
Sinica, said he and his team found the 216cm-long and 60cm-wide stone
coffin in Wanshan, Tungshan Village.</P>
      <P>The largest sarcophagus ever discovered previously in Taiwan was
found in Peinan Village, in eastern Taiwan's Taitung County, which
had a length of 210 cm. Sarcophagi normally found in Taiwan have a
length of between 160 and 180 cm.</P>
      <P>Liu estimated that the stone coffin could be as much as 3,100
years old, which should classify it as belonging to the neo-stone
age.</P>
      <P>Three years ago, archeologists unearthed stone axes, stone
bracelets and rings at the same site. Among these artifacts,
zoo-anthropomorphic (animal-shaped) jade earrings were deemed the
most precious. The finds were dated as belonging to the late
neo-stone age period.</P>
      <P>The site is located in a 1,000-ping (one ping is about 3.3 square
meters) lot owned by Lee Cheng-fu, the chairman of Changfu
Enterprise, who recently applied to build a tower on the land for
storing the ashes of the deceased.</P>
      <P>To try to save possible additional prehistoric treasures from
being ruined by the bulldozers, Liu led a team to the site early this
month. In the past few days, to the delight of Liu and his team
members, they excavated other neo-stone age artifacts, including
potsherds, lug handles, net sinkers, stone rings and stone axes.</P>
      <P>Liu said his team will continue to excavate about 40 pits over
the next three or four weeks to try to unearth more artifacts.</P>
      <P>Landowner Lee said that he is willing to postpone construction of

    <HEADLINE>NO PLAN TO EVACUATE ROC EXPATRIATES FROM INDONESIA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  16  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China government has no
plans to evacuate its nationals from Indonesia at the moment because
the situation there remains under control, Foreign Ministry spokesman
Roy Wu said on Monday.</P>
      <P>Wu made the statement after a series of riots and anti-Chinese
demonstrations were reported in several remote Indonesian townships
in recent weeks.</P>
      <P>Although some Taiwan-owned stores in those areas were ransacked
or looted, there have been no casualty reports involving Taiwan
businesspeople.</P>
      <P>Wu said most ROC expatriates live in major Indonesian cities
where public order remains fully intact. There are also no safety
problems for students at the Taipei schools in Jakarta and Surabaya
because they are closed for winter vacation.</P>
      <P>Wu pointed out that even though Indonesia is currently
encountering some economic, financial, social and political
difficulties, society is not breaking down. "It's too early to talk
about evacuation of our expatriates there," he noted.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Wu reminded local travel agencies to remain
cautious and prudent in organizing tour groups to Indonesia.
Individual travelers should also heighten their vigilance when
visiting that country, he said.</P>
      <P>According to statistics released by Indonesian authorities,
Taiwan invested a total of US$13.28 billion for 600 projects in
Indonesia between 1967 and 1997, making it the sixth largest
investor in that Southeast Asian country after Japan, Britain, Hong
Kong, Singapore and the United States.</P>
      <P>Following the outbreak of Asian financial crisis, Taiwan
businesspeople have slowed their investment activities in Indonesia
and other Southeast Asian countries and some Taiwan investors in the
region have encountered difficulties obtaining loans or export
financing. Taiwan's exports to Indonesia also suffered a 51.6 percent
year-on-year decline in January.</P>
      <P>Minister Chiao Jen-ho of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission
(OCAC) said the commission has set up a special fund to offer
emergency loans to overseas Chinese businesspeople.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan-funded companies in Indonesia can apply for such loans
if they encounter difficulties due to current anti-Chinese riots
in that country," Chiao said.</P>
      <P>Indonesia has some 8 million ethnic Chinese, but few of them are
ROC passport holders. "All ethnic Chinese attacked in the recent
riots are Indonesian nationals, not ROC expatriates," Chiao
noted.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, OCAC Vice Minister Ko Wei-shin said wealthy ethnic
Chinese businessmen in Indonesia are not facing imminent dangers
because they mostly live in large cities. Many of them have donated
sugar, cooking oil, rice and other daily necessities for distribution
to needy people in rural Indonesia through military and police
authorities or Islamic mosques and other religious groups as part of
efforts to improve relations with local people.</P>
      <P>Ko further said most ethnic Chinese living in remote or small
Indonesian townships operate groceries or small shops. "Although
they are not rich, many of them offer discount prices for
various consumer products for poor Indonesians," he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAC TO FORGE "SUPRAPARTY" MAINLAND POLICY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  16  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China's Mainland Affairs
Council (MAC) Chairman Chang King-yuh said on Monday that the MAC is
actively working out a "supraparty" policy toward mainland China as a
way of forging national consensus in future negotiations with the
mainland.</P>
      <P>As the government's mainland policy plays a vital role in
Taiwan's security, Chang said the policy itself should not be a focus
of disputes between the nation's different political parties.</P>
      <P>As a matter of fact, Chang said, one of the 36 agreements reached
in the nonpartisan National Development Conference held in late 1996
was to forge national consensus on the government's policy toward the
mainland and that the government would collect different opinions
from different political camps on the issue.</P>
      <P>However, Chang fell short of elaborating on what is a supraparty
mainland policy, but stressed that such a policy should take into
account national security, benefits to the people of Taiwan, and the
future of all Chinese people.</P>
      <P>Y.H. Lin, deputy director-general of the Department of Policy
Research under the ruling Kuomintang (KMT), said consensus reached by
the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) on Sunday
following a three-day debate on its mainland policy is similar to the
KMT's current mainland policy.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a seminar sponsored by the Vanguard Foundation, Lin
hailed the DPP's debate on the issue as enhancing the general
public's concern over cross-strait affairs, but said that the major
agreements reached in the debate coincide with the KMT's present
dealings with mainland China, which are based on maintaining the
status-quo with the mainland.</P>
      <P>Lin said the KMT has always been supportive of across-the-board
dealings with mainland China, even prior to the suspension of
cross-strait talks between the two sides, despite its understanding
that bilateral political negotiations will be difficult at present.
He was referring to one of the DPP's final agreements which urges a
stronger Taiwan industrial sector while cautiously engaging with the
mainland on the economic front.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, opposition New Party Legislator Yao Li-ming said his
party and the DPP have reached a tentative agreement to hold a joint
seminar on mainland China affairs in early April as a first step
towards forging national consensus in Taiwan's policy toward the
mainland.</P>
      <P>Yao, who was present at the DPP's three-day debate, also gave a
high appraisal of the DPP's seriousness towards the issue and the
democratic manner in which it held the debate. He said it will also
help the New Party understand the differences among the various DPP
factions and can serve as a reference for the New Party when it forms
its own relevant policies.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ERSO DIRECTOR TO DEFEND TAIWAN AT ANTI-DUMPING HEARING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Feb.  16  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Genda Hu, president of the Taiwan
Semiconductor Industry Association (TSIA), left for the United States
on Monday to fight US dumping charges leveled against the island's
manufacturers of static random access memory (SRAM) chips.</P>
      <P>Hu, concurrently director-general of the Electronics Research and
Service Organization (ERSO) under the Industrial Technology Research
Institute (ITRI), said prior to his departure that he will try his
utmost to fight for Taiwan's SRAM makers during a final public
hearing to be held by the federal International Trade Commission
(ITC) on Feb. 18.</P>
      <P>The US Department of Commerce (DOC) last week delivered its final
verdict on dumping charges against Taiwan and South Korean SRAM
manufacturers.</P>
      <P>ITC officials said DOC Assistant Secretary Robert S. Larussa has
already signed the verdict which will allow for punitive anti-dumping
tariffs on individual Taiwan and Korean SRAM makers, but the DOC
won't make a formal announcement until Tuesday.</P>
      <P>According to US anti-dumping regulations, the ITC will hold a
final public hearing on Feb. 18, and will decide by the end of March
whether Taiwan SRAM makers have really hurt the interests of Micron,
the US firm which filed the dumping charges in March 1997. If the ITC
upholds the DOC's final verdict, Taiwan-made SRAM chips will be
subject to punitive anti-dumping tariff rates starting in April.</P>
      <P>The Feb. 18 public hearing therefore will be the last chance for
Taiwan SRAM makers to defeat the charges said Hu, who was accompanied
by Chang Ching-chu, vice president of Winbond Electronics, which was
slapped with an anti-dumping tariff rate of 102.83 percent as a
result of the DOC verdict.</P>
      <P>Hu said the good news about the verdict is that Taiwan-made SRAMs
built into motherboards are not subject to the anti-dumping tariffs,
which will help minimize the impact on Taiwan makers. About
three-quarters of Taiwan-made SRAMs bound for the US are built into
motherboards.</P>
      <P>The bad news, he said, is that the anti-dumping tariff rates
listed in the DOC's final verdict, some of which are much higher than
those proposed in its initial verdict delivered last September, are
so high that it will be difficult for the defendants to convince ITC
officials during the Feb. 18 hearing that Taiwan SRAMs are not
damaging the US industry.</P>
      <P>Despite the slim chance of being able to overturn the verdict, Hu
said Taiwan makers will still try their utmost to defend themselves
against the anti-dumping charges because the case may set a precedent
for future cases which are likely to be numerous, since Taiwan has
become a major supplier of semiconductor chips like SRAMs, DRAMs, and
others.</P>
      <P>According to the DOC's final verdict, the anti-dumping tariff
rate for SRAMs produced by Taiwan's Winbond Electronics will reach
102.83 percent, compared to the 94.1 percent originally proposed. The
punitive tariff rate for another major Taiwan semiconductor producer,
United Microelectronics Corp., has also been increased from 63.36
percent to 93.87 percent, while the rate for Alliance Semiconductor
Corp. has been dropped from 59.06 percent to 50.58 percent, and that
for Hsicheng Co. has been lowered to 7.59 percent from 10.96 percent.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AUSTRALIA DEFENDS CANBERRA'S SUPPORT FOR US-LED STRIKE ON IRAQ</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Feb.  16  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia's Foreign Minister Alexander
Downer has defended Canberra's support for A US-led war against Iraq
and warned that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein is concealing enough
chemical weapons to poison the entire world.</P>
      <P>He said that although a peaceful settlement was always preferable
to military action, the Iraqi government is no closer to proposing an
acceptable solution to the eight-year impasse over UN weapons
inspections.</P>
      <P>In response to criticism from the Australian Labor Party and
Islamic groups for Australia's support of the US, Downer said Iraq
has enough VX nerve gas to kill everyone on the planet, while a mere
ounce of anthrax spores passed through the air-conditioning system of
a sports stadium could kill 70,000 people.</P>
      <P>He said UN investigations have revealed that Iraq is unable to
account for 600 tons of raw materials that could be used to make
around 200 tons of VX nerve gas.</P>
      <P>Releasing a Department of Foreign Affairs briefing paper
detailing the extent of Iraq's chemical weapon's arsenal on Sunday,
Downer ruled out criticism that a military strike was unnecessary.</P>
      <P>"Saddam Hussein has form. People who say he'd never use these
weapons are wrong because Saddam Hussein has used chemical weapons
against Iran, he's used (them) against his own people," he said.</P>
      <P>"Any leader who will use chemical weapons against his own people
would be prepared to use chemical weapons against anybody," he said.</P>
      <P>Downer denied that any military action was aimed at toppling
Saddam Hussein, saying it is for the Iraqi people to choose their own
leader.</P>
      <P>"If it comes to a military strike, the aim will be to destroy the
chemical and biological weapon capabilities of Iraq and also some of
its missile capabilities," he added.</P>
      <P>Australia has offered to send nearly an entire squadron of
Special Air Service group troops for rescue missions for downed
allied pilots and two Boeing 707s for air-to-air refueling.</P>
      <P>In 1991, Australia sent two warships to the Middle East during
the Gulf War.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN-FUNDED FIRMS IN LESOTHO URGED TO SUSPEND OPERATIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 16 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) has
asked all Taiwan-invested companies in the southern African Kingdom
of Lesotho to suspend operations, ministry spokesman Roy Wu said on
Monday.</P>
      <P>"We have kept close contact with our representative offices in
South Africa since a riot erupted at a Taiwan-funded textile factory
in Lesotho last Thursday, which resulted in the death of two workers
and the injury of more than 40 others," Wu told a press conference.</P>
      <P>In addition to immediately asking ROC nationals to close their
shops or factories in Lesotho and evacuate their families, the ROC
representative offices in Johannesburg and Durban have also managed
to push South African authorities to issue 14-day temporary visas to
ROC expatriates fleeing Lesotho.</P>
      <P>To date, Wu said, nearly all the Taiwan businesspeople residing
in Lesotho have already fled to South Africa. Most of them are
staying with friends or relatives in the town of Ladybrand, not far
from the border between the two countries.</P>
      <P>Wu said the ministry has ordered the representative offices in
Johannesburg and Durban to extend the ROC government's concern for
the well-being of the refugees and to offer them all necessary
assistance.</P>
      <P>"The representative offices have also asked South African
diplomats stationed in Lesotho to convey to the kingdom the ROC
government's concern about the incident and its demand for better
protection, both physical and material, of its nationals there," Wu
said, adding that the ROC earnestly hopes Lesotho will help resolve
the labor-management dispute at the Taiwan-owned factory as soon as
possible so that Taiwan investors can return to continue their
business operations.</P>
      <P>Although the ROC cut diplomatic ties with Lesotho in 1994 after
the African kingdom switched diplomatic recognition to Beijing,
sources said there are still some 300 ROC expatriates residing in the
country, nearly half of whom come from Putze, a small township in the
southern Taiwan county of Chiayi.</P>
      <P>According to the sources, the ROC representative offices in South
Africa have also maintained good relations with Lesotho's military
and police authorities.</P>
      <P>Reports from Johannesburg said workers at the Hsieh An Textile
Co. in the twon of Ha-Thetsane, southeast of the capital, Maseru,
went on strike a week ago to demand higherpay. The strike turned
into a riot when about 1,000 striking workers took the plant
management hostage Thursday night and spent the night at the
factory. By Friday morning the situation had deteriorated further as
striking workers threw stones at the factory and attacked people of
Chinese origin. One mainland Chinese worker was killed. A nearby
factory, run by a local Chinese community leader, was also affected.
The riot ended only after police opened fire on the rioters.</P>

    <HEADLINE>POSSIBLE DOMESTIC NUCLEAR DUMP SITES TO BE UNVEILED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 16 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan Power Co. (Taipower) said on Monday
it will send a list of possible sites for construction of a dump for
permanent disposal of low-grade nuclear waste to the Cabinet-level
Atomic Energy Council (AEC) for screening before the end of this
month.</P>
      <P>Taipower, a state-run enterprise, said there are several suitable
sites. "In addition to the five sites previously unveiled, several
new sites on remote islets controlled by the military will also be
included in the list," said Lin Ming-hsiung, a Taipower department
chief.</P>
      <P>The five previously proposed sites are Wan-an in the offshore
Penghu County, Ta-jen and Chinfeng in the eastern Taitung County,
Mutan in the southern county of Pingtung and Chukwang on the offshore
defense outpost of Matsu.</P>
      <P>Because of strong opposition from local residents, Taipower has
delayed in deciding a site for construction of a low-grade nuclear
waste dump.</P>
      <P>Press reports said Taipower has negotiated with military
authorities for several months for striking a deal on the nuclear
dump construction project.</P>
      <P>According to the reports, several military-controlled islets,
including Wuchiu, Tungchu and Pengchiayu, are among the most
likely sites to accommodate the proposed nulcear waste dump.</P>
      <P>Taipower said Taiwan currently has 172,550 barrels of low-grade
nuclear waste. About 97,000 barrels have been stored on the
Orchid Island off the southeastern Taiwan coast, while the
rest are placed at Taipower's three existing nuclear power
plants and a national nuclear power research institute.</P>
      <P>Taipower said it needs only a piece of land of one square
kilometer to build a dump for permanent disposal of all the
low-grade nuclear waste.</P>
      <P>Studies by local nulcear energy experts and geologists show that
there are several sites in Taiwan or its offshore islands suitable
for nuclear waste permanent disposal.</P>
      <P>The Atomic Energy Council (AEC) said it will carefully select a
final site after receiving the Taipower-proposed list of possible
locations. The council is expected to unveil its choice in three
months.</P>
      <P>Taipower plans to spend NT$100 million conducting geological and
environmental impact study at the AEC-approved site starting in
June. Taipower said it hopes construction of the nuclear dump can
be completed by 2004.</P>
      <P>The company has launched a series of publicity campaign to
enlist popular support for its nuclear dump construction project. It
has also promised to give NT$3 billion (US$91.46 million) to the
township where the dump will be located. Of the amount, 70
percent will be directly given to the township government for
improving welfare services to its residents, and the remaining 30
percent will be appropriated to the county government for community
development projects. If the site is under military control, Taipower
will give the money to military authorities.</P>
      <P>An AEC official said Taiwan has manpower, technology and
financial resources to dispose of low-grade nuclear dump. "What we
lack is only a dump," the official said, adding that the AEC will
strictly supervise the construction and future management of the
dump in order to ensure safety and zero accident.</P>
      <P>Taipower once struck a deal with North Korea to ship up to
60,000 barrels of low-grade nuclear waste to that country for
permanent disposal. But the contract has not been implemented
because of complex political reasons, including opposition from
the international community and North Korea's lack of funds for
building a dump.</P>

      <P>A high-ranking Kuomintang official on
Monday confirmed that KMT Secretary-General John Chang met with South
Korean Prime Minister-designate Kim Jong-pil during his trip to Seoul
last week.</P>
      <P>The official, who asked not to be named, said that Chang had a
two-hour talk with Kim on the development of relations between Taiwan
and South Korea.</P>
      <P>The official said he would not disclose details of the Chang-Kim
discussions in compliance with an agreement reached between the two.</P>
      <P>"The talks have opened a new channel of communications between
Taipei and Seoul, thus contributing greatly to increasing bilateral
ties," he stressed.</P>
      <P>Chang paid a four-day visit to Seoul Feb. 11-14, making him the
highest-ranking official of the Republic of China's ruling party to
visit South Korea since the two nations severed diplomatic ties in
1992. Taipei-Seoul relations have remained distant since that year.</P>
      <P>Chang was forced to cancel a planned meeting with South Korean
President Kim Dae-jung due to interference from Beijing, the official
said.</P>
      <P>Kim, however, had one of his close aides extend an apology to
Chang over the aborted meeting and asked the KMT secretary-general to
forward a personal letter from him to ROC President Lee Teng-hui, the
official said.</P>
      <P>According to a CNA dispatch from Seoul, Chang also met with Lew
Jong-keun, Kim Dae-jung's special economic adviser.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAC CHIEF PRAISES DPP'S CONSENSUS ON M'LAND POLICY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  16  (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government's top mainland affairs
official on Monday praised the consensus the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) has reached on the party's policy toward
mainland China.</P>
      <P>Chang King-yuh, chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC),
said that the DPP's statement is in the same spirit as the existing
mainland policy of the government, which proposes enhancing
cross-strait relations step by step.</P>
      <P>Chang made the remarks in an interview with CNA.</P>
      <P>The DPP, the island's largest opposition party, announced at the
conclusion of a recent three-day party symposium that it will adopt a
"comprehensive" strategy in negotiations with Beijing, promote the
upgrade of Taiwan's industrial sector and engage cautiously with the
mainland on the economic front.</P>
      <P>The MAC head stressed that the government has long hoped that
Taiwan and mainland China will replace their current antagonism with
harmonious relations and that the two sides will develop
mutually-beneficial trade and economic exchanges.</P>
      <P>The current state of relations across the Taiwan Strait -- with
Beijing yet to renounce the use of force against Taiwan -- must be
taken into consideration amid Taiwan businesses' pursuit of mainland
markets, which, given mainland China's huge population and abundant
resources, is seen as a potential gold mine, Chang said.</P>
      <P>He reiterated the government's call for local enterprises that
wish to expand their businesses in the mainland to ensure their roots
on the island are deep, which he pointed out would reduce the
political and economic risks involved in mainland investment.</P>
      <P>Regarding cross-strait negotiations, Chang revealed that his
ministry is working on a "sur-factional" mainland policy based on the
consensus reached at the 1996 National Development Conference, saying
opinions from different political parties -- including the DPP --
will also be included.</P>
      <P>The MAC official did not reveal specifics of the "sur-factional"
policy but merely stressed that a good mainland China policy should
take the nation's safety, people's welfare and the future of all of
China into serious consideration.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DECISION ON BAYER'S LAND-LEASE CONTRACT DELAYED AGAIN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 16 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>As more than 1,000 opponents of a proposed
toluene di-isocyanate (TDI) plant in central Taiwan's Taichung County
protested outside the Taiwan Provincial Assembly on Monday, an
assembly panel inside again voted to delay their decision on the
plant's land-lease contract, dealing another blow to the German
chemical giant Bayer.</P>
      <P>Because the ruling Kuomintang, however, has called on its members
to support the proposed NT$49.2 billion (US$1.5 billion) Bayer TDI
plant as a showcase for the government's plan to make the island a
regional operational hub, there is still a chance that the land-lease
contract will be approved Tuesday when it reaches the transportation
committee Tuesday and later on Feb. 26 when it is sent to the floor
of the Assembly, where the ruling party enjoys a comfortable
majority.</P>
      <P>Monday's debate on the contract, which would allow Bayer to lease
a plot of Taiwan Province-owned land near Taichung Harbor for the
site of its billion-dollar plus chemical plant, reopened Monday
morning at a panel while a group of protesters rallied outside the
conference site.</P>
      <P>The protesters, led by You Pi-ling, the female head of Wuchi
township, came from four rural towns around the site of the proposed
plant. They shouted anti-Bayer slogans and waved signs calling for a
local plebiscite to decide the fate of the project.</P>
      <P>They clashed with riot police when they tried to storm into the
conference site and scuffled with a handful of project supporters.
One of the supporters, who emerged from the conference site after
presenting a petition with 15,000 signature in favor of the Bayer
plant, was beaten by a number of the protesters.</P>
      <P>Under a local assemblywoman's mediation, 50 opponents were
allowed to entered the site to monitor the debate of the ad hoc
panel, which, after three hours of discussion, voted to postpone any
decision on the grounds that there are still fears of the project's
safety among local residents.</P>
      <P>The panel, caught between the strong pressure from local
anti-Bayer groups and the central government's urge for approval,
also delayed the same decision on Dec. 18.</P>
      <P>At that time, the German giant announced in disappointment that
it would scrap its TDI project. The central government, however,
asked Bayer to hold off the decision until the project's fate was
formally determined.</P>
      <P>In an attempt to allay the public's fear of the proposed plant,
the central government organized a fact-finding team comprising local
assembly delegates and industrial experts to visit Bayer's
headquarters in Dormagen, Germany earlier this month.</P>
      <P>The team members were favorably impressed by Bayer's
environmental protection measures and its safety record in handling
phosgene, the poisonous chemical needed in the production of TDI.</P>
      <P>Bayer promised not to abandon the project that it began two years
ago until the end of February when the Taiwan Provincial Assembly is
scheduled to debate it on the Assembly floor.</P>
      <P>Despite Monday's setback, Yang Wen-hsing, vice speaker of the
Assembly and a KMT member, said that the Assembly will debate the
issue on Feb. 26 as scheduled if it is approved by the Transportation
Committee on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>In order to shepherd the project successfully through the
Assembly, Chairman of the Council for Economic Planning and
Development P.K. Chaing, the Cabinet member in charge of the Bayer
project, threw a luncheon Monday for the Taiwan Provincial Assembly,
but only a few of the 73 members showed up.</P>
      <P>At a press conference ahead of the luncheon, Chiang lauded Bayer,
noting that it boasts of 19 TDI plants around the globe, is one of
five firms in the world that engage in TDI production, and has
accumulated the equivalent of about 400 years of production
experience per plant in total without any accident.</P>
      <P>The press conference also featured a display of the form of
Styrofoam through the reaction of TDI and resin that Chiang said
demonstrates the safety of the proposed Bayer plant.</P>
      <P>Horst Mueck, chairman of the Bayer Taiwan Co., regretted on
Monday that the protesters used violence. He said that in a free
society, Bayer's supporters are entitled to express their opinion.</P>
      <P>Chen Chia-chung, a spokesman for the company, said that Bayer
will stick to its timetable for the resumption of its Taiwan TDI
project, which requires the approval of the land-lease contract by
the end of February and ground to be broken before September.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CONCLUSION OF DPP DEBATES SEEN AS SIMILAR TO KMT POLICY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  16  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The conclusions of the major opposition
Democratic Progressive Party's just-completed debates on policy
toward mainland China are basically similar to the policy of the
ruling Kuomintang, although not so comprehensive, a high-ranking
official of the ruling party said Monday.</P>
      <P>Chang Jung-kung, director general of the Mainland Operations
Department of the Kuomintang Central Committee, said at a high-level
meeting of the party that the three-day debates have however shown
that the DPP is now more able to keep up with cross-strait relations
than in April, 1993 when it protested against the first round of
high-level unofficial talks between Taiwan and mainland China in
Singapore.</P>
      <P>During the debates held Feb. 13-15 in Taipei, factional leaders
of the opposition party reached a consensus that Taiwan should
strengthen its base and deal with the west side of the Taiwan
Strait with care. The consensus is very similar to President Lee
Teng-hui's "be patient, no haste" policy toward communist China,
Chang said.</P>
      <P>Chang King-yuh, chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council of the
Executive Yuan, also made similar remarks Monday.</P>
      <P>Several other participants in the meeting told the press they
believed that the DPP debates have little substance, although they
have generated good publicity for the opposition party.</P>
      <P>John Chang, secretary general of the Kuomintang Central
Committee, is expected to explain the mainland policy of the ruling
party and his views on the DPP debates Tuesday.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FAULT LINES IN JAPAN, MAINLAND CHINA AND US SEEN THREATENING GLOBAL ECONOMY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Feb.  16  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Should fault lines in Japan, mainland
China and Wall Street occur, the global economy will be threatened
with a chain-reaction, the first casualty of which will be the
destruction of the fragile "fire-walls" which the International
Monetary Fund has erected around the Asian financial crisis.</P>
      <P>Writing on the front page of the mass circulation newspaper The
Sydney Morning Herald on Monday, economic writer Max Walsh said Japan
will come under pressure when the Tokyo government unveils its latest
plan to revive the economy, because Asian leaders expect Japan to
take decisive action to kickstart its economy with a strong package
of fiscal stimuli that will provide an economic anchor for the
region.</P>
      <P>The Japanese banking system is deeply integrated with the global
banking system and any failure will send ripples through world
markets -- ripples that could turn into large waves.</P>
      <P>The Asian region takes some 40 percent of Japan's exports, the
lion's share of which are capital goods, which the Asian economies no
longer can afford.</P>
      <P>With Asian markets contracting, Japan will become an even more
aggressive exporter to the advanced economies. If Japanese banks
cannot or will not roll over loans to the beleaguered Asian
economies, then they will experience further turmoil and recession.</P>
      <P>That will inevitably increase concern about the impact these
developments will have on mainland China.</P>
      <P>He said mainland China has embarked on enormous structural change
that was always fraught with risk, but which has become much more
difficult because of what has happened in the Asian region over the
past six months.</P>
      <P>Though mainland China has so far come through this financial
crisis relatively unscathed, it is still being buffeted by the
adverse economic winds blowing across the region.</P>
      <P>Many mainland Chinese exports such as clothing, footwear, cheap
electronics and light industrial products compete with the output of
the now heavily depreciated currencies of Thailand and Indonesia.</P>
      <P>Mainland China has been moving its exports further up the
value-added chain, but here it has to compete with both Taiwan and
South Korea.</P>
      <P>Strong export growth is essential for mainland China if it is to
move successfully through the next stage of its structural reform
without political upheaval.</P>
      <P>This has raised fears that mainland China will devalue its
currency to make it more competitive. He said mainland China's
structural-cum-financial problems are similar to those which have
brought South Korea to its knees.</P>
      <P>Its banking system has extended excessive credits to industrial
enterprises and state-owned enterprises which have operated without
being disciplined by bottom-line considerations.</P>
      <P>Where mainland China is different is that its banks are
state-owned and they have not borrowed from abroad. Being
state-owned, their capital base, in effect, is the national tax base.</P>
      <P>The same back-stop, access to consolidated revenue, means
depositors remain confident that they are viable.</P>
      <P>In fact, they are not. While nobody knows the exact problem loan
situation of the mainland Chinese banks, the US ratings agency S&amp;P
puts it at 60 percent of its gross domestic product, which would make
the situation twice as bad as that in Korea, Walsh said.</P>
      <P>Investment capital flown to mainland China from Taiwan and Hong
Kong is in decline because the two places are grappling with their
own problems.</P>
      <P>Mainland Chinese leaders have repeatedly said Beijing will not
devalue its currency, yet they could reverse their policy next year
if the country cannot compete with other Asian exporters in the world
market.</P>
      <P>A higher proportion of US household wealth is now held in
equities than ever before. The long bull run on Wall Street has
underwritten consumer confidence and spending. So far, Wall Street
has shrugged off the Asian crisis, moving to new record levels. In
fact, part of its latest success is because of what is happening in
Asia, because many investors in Asia have pulled out their money and
channeled the money into the US, Walsh said.</P>
      <P>The last year has seen a sharp increase in the flow of capital
from Japan, Hong Kong and Europe into US equities and bond markets.</P>
      <P>But should this capital flow stop or move into reverse -- a
development which would be on the cards should Japan move into an
extended recession -- then Wall Street will be hurt, Walsh said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CAL AIRLINER CRASHES NEAR CKS AIRPORT, KILLS OVER 200</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  16  (CNA)
(By Bear Lee)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A China Airlines (CAL) Airbus A-300
passenger plane with 196 on board crashed near Chiang Kai-shek
International Airport in northern Taiwan Monday evening, a CAL
spokesman said Monday.</P>
      <P>The ill fated airliner, which took off from the Indonesian resort
of Bali in the afternoon, was to have landed at the airport at 8:20
in the evening. It was ordered to take a "go around" after a failed
landing attempt due to poor visibility at the airport caused by heavy
fog.</P>
      <P>The plane then first hit the airport fence before it crashed into
a residential area along the Western Coastal Highway at 8:07.</P>
      <P>Civil Aeronautics Administration Deputy Director General Chang
Kuo-cheng said that all the 196 passengers and crew were feared dead
as no survivors had been found so far.</P>
      <P>A 10-year boy was rescued and rushed to a nearby hospital for
treatment. But he died before reaching the hospital. Seven others,
including two from the destroyed flats and five from cars on the
highway, were confirmed dead. A baby from one of the ruined houses
was found alive and was rushed to a hospital.</P>
      <P>Chang would not confirm whether Bank of China (CBC) Governor Sheu
Yuan-dong and his wife were among the victims, although they and
three other CBC officials were on the passenger manifest.</P>
      <P>Sheu and the CBC officials were returning from a trip to Bali,
where they attended the annual conference of the governors of the
Central Bank of Southeast Asia.</P>
      <P>Airport officials said that because the plane burst into flame,
the chances that any of the 182 passengers or 14 crew members
survived are very slim.</P>
      <P>Witnesses said that bodies of the victims were scattered over an
area of two square kilometers.</P>
      <P>Premier Vincent Siew, upon being informed of the accident,
expressed his sorrow and regret and he extended his condolences to
the families of the victims.</P>
      <P>Siew asked the Ministry of Transportation and Communication to
investigate the cause of the accident and handle the follow-up.</P>
      <P>President Lee Teng-hui and Vice President Lien Chan also
expressed their regret over the tragedy.</P>
      <P>This was the second major accident for CAL in less than four
years. A CAL A-300 airbus plane crashed at Nagoya airport in Japan on
April 26, 1994, killing 264 of the 271 on board.</P>

    <DATELINE>Hong  Kong,  Feb.  17  (CNA)
(By Stanley Cheung and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Most Hong Kong people are against a
mainland Chinese invasion of Taiwan, even if the island were to
declare outright independence, according to a public opinion poll
released on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The telephone poll of 1,000 adult Hong Kong residents, conducted
in January by the Hong Kong-based Cross-Strait Relations Research
Center, found that 73 percent of the respondents opposed the proposal
that Beijing attack Taiwan should the island announce de jure
independence, with only 8.8 percent of those polled supporting such
an overture.</P>
      <P>Survey results also show that 49.8 percent of those interviewed
do not think that the Beijing-proposed "one country, two systems"
scheme is applicable to Taiwan, while 23.7 percent said they believe
Beijing can successfully use this formula to unify Taiwan with the
mainland.</P>
      <P>Asked about whether they support permanent separation of Taiwan
from the Chinese mainland, 59.7 percent responded negatively, while
only 17.8 percent gave a thumbs-up.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 42.2 percent said they are pessimistic about the
prospects for peaceful reunification of the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait, compared to 32.9 percent who sounded a positive note.</P>
      <P>The survey further found that 75.8 percent of the respondents
think Hong Kong and Taiwan should exchange official representative
offices to boost bilateral relations, while 13.6 percent oppose the
proposal.</P>
      <P>About 53 percent said they believe Hong Kong's reversion to
mainland Chinese rule has weakened the territory's role in promoting
relations across the Taiwan Strait, but 29.4 percent said held a
contrary opinion.</P>
      <P>Nearly 44 percent said they feel Taiwan-Hong Kong relations have
remained unchanged following Hong Kong's handover on July 1, 1997;
35.2 percent said they think post-handover Taiwan-Hong Kong ties have
worsened; but 9.3 percent said they feel bilateral relations have
improved over the past half-year.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Australian elite troops and two Boeing
707 aircraft are leaving Tuesday for the Persian Gulf in support of a
US-led force in the case a military strike against Iraq is
inevitable, Prime Minister John Howard said.</P>
      <P>In a statement, Howard said the National Security Committee of
the federal Cabinet has authorized the deployment of elements of the
Australian Defense Force to the Gulf.</P>
      <P>Howard traveled to Perth on Tuesday morning to bid farewell to
about 190 troops, including 110 Special Air Service soldiers and two
Boeing 707s for air-to-air refueling purposes during the military
action.</P>
      <P>Howard also said the New Zealand prime minister contacted him on
Monday and indicated his country would send elite troops to the Gulf
as well in support of the US-led action against Iraq.</P>
      <P>"Every effort will be made for cooperation between the Australian
and New Zealand forces should military action become necessary," he
said.</P>
      <P>"I want to emphasize that the contribution that Australia is
making demonstrates our desire to make it plain to Saddam Hussein and
the Iraqi leadership that a growing number of the states of the
civilized world will not tolerate or agree to his continued
possession of and capacity to deliver weapons of mass destruction.
That does represent a threat not only to the immediate region, but
also in the long run to the security of nations around the world," he
said.</P>
      <P>The Australian troops and the aircraft will be based in Kuwait.</P>
      <P>Howard on Monday said: "The government continues to hope that
force will not be needed. We strongly support diplomatic efforts to
persuade Iraq to comply fully with UN Security Council resolutions
requiring it to dismantle its chemical and biological weapons
programs and allow inspections. There is still time for Iraq to
reconsider," he said.</P>
      <P>This will be the second time for Australia to support its Western
allies in the Middle East. In 1991, Australia sent two warships to

    <TEXT>
      <P>Singapore and Malaysia are on track to
achieving better bilateral ties, Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok
Tong said Monday in Kuala Lumpur after a meeting with Malaysian Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad, The Straits Times reported Tuesday.</P>
      <P>In a dispatch from Kuala Lumpur, the Singapore-based paper also
quoted Goh as saying that he and Mahathir had instructed their
respective officials to step up efforts to resolve outstanding issues
between the two countries.</P>
      <P>"There will always be problems and some issues will remain
unresolved. But you can't expect issues that have been there for
years to be solved in one meeting," he was quoted as telling
reporters after touring the Kuala Lumpur City Center.</P>
      <P>"But what is important is that we are progressing," he said.
"Certainly relations today are better than last year."</P>
      <P>Ties between the two neighbors took a sudden turn for the worse
last March, following comments by Singapore Senior Minister Lee Kuan
Yew's about crime in the Malaysian city of Johor.</P>
      <P>Goh also disclosed Monday that Mahathir had agreed to supply
water to Singapore beyond 2061, when the existing water supply
agreement expires, "on terms and conditions to be agreed upon."</P>
      <P>He declined to give details, noting that officials were still
working to come up with wording for the text of the agreement which
will be acceptable to both sides, the report said.</P>
      <P>Goh, who is in Kuala Lumpur on a two-day working visit, had
earlier held a "four-eyes" meeting with the Malaysian leader, which
lasted more than an hour. This was followed by a 45-minute
closed-door meeting with ministers and officials from both sides,
including Singapore Foreign Minister S. Jayakumar.</P>
      <P>Briefing the press later, Malaysian Foreign Minister Abdullah
Badawi said that relations were "back to normal," the report said.</P>
      <P>He said he was very positive and even "bullish" about bilateral
ties.</P>
      <P>The two leaders had discussed the regional currency crisis, as
well as bilateral issues, such as plans to develop Malayan Railway
(KTM) land in Singapore, Malaysia's claim to the Singapore-held
island of Pedra Branca, as well as the long-term supply of water to
Singapore.</P>
      <P>Talks on these issues, which have been stalled for about two
years, are set to resume, Badawi said.</P>
      <P>He also told reporters that both sides planned to work out a
mechanism to prevent ties from being unsettled in the future by "pin
pricks and irritants," the report said.</P>
      <P>These, he added, should be settled by officials and ministers,
without waiting for the two prime ministers to meet to thrash them
out, the report added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Harmoko, chairman of the ruling Golkar's
Functional Group Board of Executives, said he has proudly stepped
aside to make way for B.J. Habibie as the party's only nominee for
the vice presidency.</P>
      <P>"This means Golkar will only propose one nominee, B.J. Habibie,
for vice president. President Suharto, in his capacity as the party's
patron, has instructed that the decision should be constitutionally
processed in the upcoming People's Consultative Assembly," he was
quoted by Antara news agency as saying Monday.</P>
      <P>Harmoko said he "gave way" for the sake of the party and the
nation. He added that he will concentrate on his position as speaker
of parliament.</P>
      <P>Harmoko spoke to the press following a second plenary meeting of
Golkar, held specifically to discuss the vice presidential nominee.</P>
      <P>During that meeting, Golkar instructed the Gokar Faction to fight
in the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR) to win the position for
Habibie for the 1998-2003 term.</P>
      <P>He said Golkar has received additional input from a meeting
involving the ruling party's three divisions, A (Armed Forces), B
(bureaucracy) and G (Functional Group). After the meeting, the
results were related to the head of state in his capacity as Golkar's
patron.</P>
      <P>Harmoko did not mention the words "withdraw from the nomination"
but said he "give way for Habibie to become the vice presidential
nominee."</P>

presidential nominee is final.</P>
      <P>Harmoko added that in the board's first meeting on Feb. 11, the

internal mechanism, he said, the group's divisions were consulted
about the two nominees.</P>
      <P>In his meeting with Golkar's patron, Indonesian President

on his present responsibilities.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the party's decision could reduce the exchange rate
against the US dollar and the high cost of staple commodities,
Harmoko said the decision had nothing to do with the exchange rate or
other issues.</P>
      <P>"This is Golkar's full responsibility as the largest
sociopolitical organization which has agreed to nominate Mohammad
Suharto for the next president and B.J. Habibie as his vice
president," he added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Relatives have identified 78 bodies of
those killed in the crash of a China Airlines (CAL) A-300 Airbus
plane as of Tuesday morning.</P>
      <P>With most of the bodies burned beyond recognition, the
identification work proceeded slowly amid the wailing sounds of
grieving relatives in the temporary morgue set up by CAL near the
crash site.</P>
      <P>Coroners were conducting DNA tests throughout the afternoon to
help anxious relatives identify their loved ones.</P>
      <P>Among the remains that have been identified so far is the body of
Central Bank of China Governor Sheu Yuan-dong, who was aboard the
ill-fated plane on his return from Bali, Indonesia, where he attended
the annual conference of the Governors of the Central Banks of
Southeast Asia.</P>
      <P>The CAL plane left the resort island of Bali for Taipei in the
afternoon, and was due to arrive at Chiang Kai-shek International
Airport at 8:20 p.m. After one aborted landing, the aircraft circled
around for a second attempt before it went down short of the runway,
crashing into a residential area on the northern side of the airport
along the Western Coast Highway at 8:07 p.m.</P>
      <P>All 196 passengers and crew members aboard the plane were killed.
Two persons died when the aircraft struck their houses and five
occupants in a passing car also perished in the tragic crash.</P>
      <P>A recording of conversations between the pilots and the control
tower prior to the crash was made public Tuesday morning. The
situation seemed normal before two ringing sounds were heard
immediately before the plane went down.</P>
      <P>CAL officials said the French-made A-300 Airbus was only seven
years and two months old, had 20,193 flying hours and had made 8,828
landings and takeoffs. It had a good maintenance record and the
pilots were experienced.</P>
      <P>The officials said they will have to wait for the results of an
analysis of the "black box," the cockpit voice and flight data
recorders, which were retrieved around 10:00 p.m. Monday.</P>
      <P>Airbus officials from France are scheduled to arrive here Tuesday
afternoon to help determine the cause of the crash.</P>
      <P>CAL officials said the airline has nine other A-300 Airbus planes
operating in its fleet.</P>
      <P>This was the second major accident for CAL in less than four
years. The same model of CAL aircraft crashed at Nagoya Airport in
Japan on April 26, 1994, killing 264 of the 271 passengers and crew
aboard.</P>
      <P>Because of the latest incident, CAL canceled two flights on
Tuesday -- flight CI-607 from Taipei to Hong Kong in the morning and
flight CI-608 from Hong Kong to Taipei in the afternoon.</P>

      <P>The Asian currency crisis has brought
casinos throughout Australia falling revenues and forced expansions
to be put on hold due to the declining number of gamblers coming to
the country from Asia.</P>
      <P>In its latest survey, The Australian Financial Review,

a second hotel tower because the Asian economic crisis has taken a

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Singapore Trade Development Board
(TDB) launched the new International Franchise Enterprise Program
(IFEP) Tuesday to provide a higher level of support to Singapore
companies in their development and marketing of their franchise
concepts.</P>
      <P>This is part of the TDB's continuing efforts to promote
franchising services overseas and develop Singapore into an
international franchise hub with total support capabilities, the TDB
said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>It pointed out that the IFEP provides an integrated package of
assistance and facilitation for three targeted groups:</P>
      <P>-- Singapore Franchise Enterprise: Indigenous franchise concepts
from Singapore that are expanding overseas;</P>
      <P>-- Regional Franchise Enterprise: Singapore enterprises that are
acquiring regional master franchise licenses; and</P>
      <P>-- Franchise Brand Owners: Singapore enterprises that are
acquiring the ownership of international franchises.</P>
      <P>The TDB said that Singapore companies with franchise business
activities, who fall into any of the three categories, can enjoy the
TDB's support and assistance in the acquisition, adaptation and
marketing of franchise concepts.</P>
      <P>Companies under the Singapore Franchise Enterprise group will
receive the following support:</P>
      <P>-- Financial assistance up to a maximum of 70 percent of eligible
expenses;</P>
      <P>-- Support for marketing activities such as marketing trips,
fairs and missions; and</P>
      <P>-- Support for advertising activities for initial franchise
launches overseas.</P>
      <P>Companies under the Regional Franchise Enterprise group will
receive financial support to acquire the master franchise rights to a
foreign franchise for a territory including Singapore and beyond, and
sub-franchise parts of this territory to other parties.</P>
      <P>The TDB's assistance to this group will be through a combination
of grants and tax incentives, providing assistance in acquisition
feasibility studies of foreign franchises, support for master

    <HEADLINE>CAL GIVEN POOR FLIGHT SAFETY RATING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington, Feb. 16 (CNA)
(By Herman Pan and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>China Airlines (CAL), Taiwan's flagship
carrier, ranks among the 29 international air passenger companies
with substandard flight safety records, according to a rating
compiled by the private US Air Travelers Association.</P>
      <P>The rating was based on flight safety records of the world's 260
commercial airliners over the past 10 years. The association gave
"perfect" or "near perfect" ratings to 210 carriers. CAL and 28 other
carriers were given "flunking" scores.</P>
      <P>Besides Monday's crash, CAL had been involved in 11 major flight
accidents over the past 30 years, resulting in the death of 411
Taiwan and foreign passengers and crew members.</P>
      <P>In the 10-year period alone, running to the end of 1997, CAL
recorded four major accidents, including the crash of an Airbus A-300
jet in Nagoya, Japan on April 26, 1994, which killed a total of 322
passengers and crew members onboard.</P>
      <P>On Monday, another CAL Airbus A-300 jet crashed near Taiwan's
Chiang Kai-shek International Airport, some 30 kilometers southwest
of Taipei, in dense night fog and light rain, killing all 196 persons
aboard and seven others on the ground.</P>
      <P>CAL has embarked on an extensive safety campaign since the 1994
Nagoya crash. It is also actively preparing to increase the number
of flights and destinations in the United States, cashing in on the
newly signed Taiwan-US open-skies agreement and the US
Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) upgrade of Taiwan's rating
for flight safety supervision and management.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the open-skies accord, Taiwan carriers can
cooperate with their American counterparts in operating many new
air routes based on a code-sharing scheme.</P>
      <P>The FAA once evaluated Taiwan's civil aviation management and
supervision system in 1996. It claimed that Taiwan failed to meet the
world requirements for commercial airlines supervision, and thus
rated Taiwan's flight safety control system as "second grade."</P>
      <P>Through concerted strenuous efforts of Taiwan's Civil Aeronautics
Administration and airline companies, the FAA finally agreed to
upgrade Taiwan's flight safety control and management system to the
"first grade" in April 1997 after several rounds of inspection.</P>
      <P>Airline sources said Monday's crash may hinder CAL's plans to
expand its global flight services at least in the short term.</P>

      <P>Chen Hung-ki, whip of the ruling Kuomintang, said in the

disaster in less than four years -- not only revealed the airline's
poor flight safety but also has damaged the nation's image.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CENTRAL GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS OPTIMISTIC ABOUT BAYER CASE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  17  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Ranking central government officials are
still optimistic about the fate of a NT$50 billion (US$1.5 billion)
investment plan by the Germany-based Bayer Group to set up a
toluene-di-isocyanate (TDI) plant in central Taiwan's Taichung
Harbor, despite the Taiwan Provincial Assembly's decision on Monday
to delay reviewing the case amid violent protests from more than
1,000 opponents outside the building.</P>
      <P>Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) Chairman
P.K. Chiang, who chaired a seminar on Monday in Taichung to sell the
project, was optimistic after the event. "We will overcome the
obstacles step by step," he said.</P>
      <P>Although Taichung County Magistrate Liao Yung-lai of the
opposition Democratic Progressive Party has insisted on holding a
public referendum to decide the fate of the Bayer project, Chiang
reiterated that such practices lack a legal basis in Taiwan. He
called Bayer's case an economic and technical issue and said that the
CEPD hopes to resolve the matter through communication with local
residents.</P>
      <P>Chiang said the government will provide the Taiwan Provincial
Assembly with detailed information on Bayer's preventive measures
against earthquakes and typhoons to help assuage the people's
concern.</P>
      <P>Government Information Office Director-General Chen Chien-jen
said the government supports Bayer setting up the TDI plant near
Taichung Harbor in Taichung County, taking into consideration the
country's and the area's long-term development.</P>
      <P>After more than two years of arrangements and negotiations, Bayer
announced in December that it was relocating the project to the
United States as a result of strong opposition from local residents
over fears that the TDI plant would cause environmental pollution.</P>
      <P>But the chemical giant told a visiting fact-finding delegation
composed of more than 30 local experts and opinion leaders and ROC
government officials early this month that it wouldn't cancel the
investment plan in Taiwan should the Taiwan Provincial Assembly pass
the land lease contract by the end of this month to facilitate
construction on the TDI production plant by September.</P>
      <P>CEPD Vice Chairman Y.S. Liu, leader of the delegation, said he
and the others were very impressed by Bayer's environmental
protection and safety measures, adding that the company has already
spent NT$1.5 billion in foundation work at the construction site and
that earthquakes and typhoons should not be a cause for the public to
worry.</P>
      <P>Other delegates voiced regrets for not having enough time to
report their recent trip to Bayer's headquarters in Dormagen, central
Germany, to the public. They said that Taiwan would lose a
significant chance of upgrading its industrial sector if Bayer's
plans fail to materialize here.</P>
      <P>Despite the central government's efforts to push for the Bayer
plant, it remains to be seen whether the Taiwan Provincial Assembly
will approve Bayer's land lease contract by the end of this month,
the deadline set by Bayer.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the results of a public opinion survey made public on
Monday by the Taichung County Government showed that 39 percent of
the total county population are in favor of Bayer's project, while 21
percent support the plan conditionally. Only 24 percent are opposed
to the plan.</P>
      <P>The results are significantly different than those of an earlier
poll of people living in the four townships near Taichung Harbor,
which showed 40 percent of the public opposed to the investment plan,
while only 26 percent backed the project.</P>
      <P>The Taichung County Government has said that the fate of the
Bayer plant will be decided by the residents of the four townships
near the harbor.</P>

      <P>Chang King-yuh, chairman of the
cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC), remarked on Monday that
should Beijing respond formally to a proposal that the head of the
Taipei-based Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) visit mainland China,
the SEF would respond in kind.</P>
      <P>The SEF has written twice to its Beijing-based counterpart, the
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS), proposing
that SEF Chairman Koo Chen-fu visit mainland China, he noted.</P>
      <P>Chang was responding to reports that ARATS Vice Chairman Tang
Shubei recently told a delegation from Taiwan's New Party that was
visiting mainland China that ARATS is taking the SEF's proposal of a
visit by Koo "seriously."</P>
      <P>According to an agreement reached in 1993 between Koo and his
mainland counterpart, ARATS Chairman Wang Daohan, the two sides
should conduct regular high-level exchanges, Chang noted, adding that
the SEF has not received a formal reply to its twice-issued proposal
that Koo travel to mainland China.</P>
      <P>He stressed that ARATS should respond formally to the proposed
visit. He went on to say that the SEF's fax machine is always on, and
that a faxed letter from ARATS could resolve the situation.</P>
      <P>Koo has said that he would be willing to visit the mainland and
meet relevant officials so that a "warmer atmosphere can be created"
between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, Chang noted. If there is
a difference of opinion, the MAC official added, "we hope the
mainland could tell us formally by sending us a letter."</P>

meeting of central bank governors from 10 Southeast Asian countries.</P>
      <P>Liang, who has been appointed by Premier Vincent Siew to serve
as the central bank's acting governor, said a CBC board meeting
originally scheduled for Feb. 26 will be postponed due to the
tragic incident.</P>
      <P>At the moment, Liang said, the central bank will continue
implementing the Sheu-crafted "measured" easy credity policy in
order to meet the local business community's normal cash demand.</P>
      <P>Liang recalled that Sheu had telepohoned him shortly before
leaving Bali for home. "Sheu told me that he had exchanged views
with his counterparts from 10 Southeast Asian countries on ways to
resolve the region's financial woes, maintain regional financial
stability and help Taiwan-owned companies in the region tide over
their current difficulties," he said.</P>
      <P>Liang said Sheu was particularly concerned about the
difficulties faced by Taiwan companies in the beleaguered Southeast
Asian economies.</P>
      <P>"He asked me to notify the three local banks which all have
several branches in Southeast Asian countries to draft respective
packages of measures to help Taiwan-funded firms in the region,"
Liang said.</P>
      <P>The three banks -- the First Commercial Bank, the International
Commercial Bank of China and the Export-Import Bank of the Republic
of China -- have all submitted comprehensive packages to the central
bank. "We'll unveil them at an appropriate time," Liang said.</P>
      <P>Sheu, 71, once said the central bank would deposit some of its
huge foreign exchange reserves at overseas branches of Taiwan banks
to help them offer loans or short-term export financing to
Taiwan-owned companies abroad, particularly those in troubled
Southeast Asian countries.</P>
      <P>With the CBC's capital infusion, the short-term interest rates
in the local monetary market reamined stable on Tuesday. Trading on
the foreign exchange market also remained normal, with the New
Taiwan dollar edging down marginally to close at NT$32.9 against
US$1. The local stock market opened lower in a bearish mood, but
rallied after mid-session and closed higher than Monday's finish.</P>
      <P>The four other CBC officials died in the plane crash were Chen
Huang, director-general of the Foreign Exchange Department; Chien
Chi-min, director-general of the Economic Research Department; Lin
Rong-tien, director-general of the Department of Secretariat; and
Lin Li-wen, a specialist with the Foreign Exchange Department.</P>
      <P>Premier Siew paid a visit to the central bank Tuesday morning to
boost morale of the CBC staff.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>"Americans have more than a humanitarian
interest in mitigating Asia's pain," the International Herald Tribune
said on Monday.</P>
      <P>So far, the economic impact on the United States has been, if
anything, beneficial, as Asia's crisis dampens inflationary pressure
in America, the influential mass-circulation international daily
pointed out.</P>
      <P>In the coming months, however, the impact is likely to be less
positive, as competitive pressures will threaten some American jobs,
it said, adding that if the economic crisis worsens and provokes
ethnic riots in Indonesia and social instability elsewhere, this
could have a terrible impact on the United States.</P>
      <P>The financial situation remains precarious, especially in
Indonesia, the daily noted. But other economies in the region --
including those not yet infected or barely infected by the Asian
"contagion" -- remain vulnerable to shifts in fickle and sometimes
irrational international financial flows, it said.</P>
      <P>Any one of these developing nations, or all of them, could be
tripped up by a US congressional refusal to support the International
Monetary Fund (IMF), the daily said.</P>
      <P>It would help the Clinton administration's position and the IMF's
if both were seen to be hard at work to prevent the next crisis, the

    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia's Prime Minister John Howard
has been urged to raise mainland China's chemical and biological
weapons programs when he meets with mainland China's Defense Minister
General Chi Haotian in Canberra later this week.</P>
      <P>Chi is visiting Australian military bases in Cairns, Queensland,
and is expected to meet Howard, Foreign Minister Alexander Downer,
and Defense Minister Ian McLachlan, among other senior officials. Chi
is the highest-ranking military officer from mainland China to visit
Australia.</P>
      <P>The Australian Financial Review on Tuesday reported that the US
Pentagon, in its latest report, claimed that mainland China has
chemical and biological weapons.</P>
      <P>The report says: "In the near future, China is likely to achieve
the necessary expertise and delivery capability to integrate chemical
weapons successfully into overall military operations. China's
current inventory of chemical agents includes the full range of
traditional agents and China is conducting research into more
advanced agents. It has a wide variety of delivery systems for
chemical agents, including tube artillery, rockets, mortars,
landmines, aerial bombs, sprayers and short-range ballistic
missiles."</P>
      <P>The daily reported that the Pentagon appears to place little
trust in the fact that mainland China ratified the Chemical Weapons
Convention last April -- about the same time as the US. It is even
less convinced by mainland China's ratification of the Biological and
Toxin Weapons Convention in 1984, according to the daily.</P>

      <P>In the wake of Taiwan's worst air accident,
the Ministry of Transportation and Communications on Tuesday ordered
all Airbus planes belonging to China Airlines (CAL) to be grounded
for safety checks.</P>
      <P>"The ministry has ordered that all Taiwan-bound CAL A300-600
Airbus planes be grounded for thorough safety checks upon their
return to Taiwan airports, and that they will not be allowed to take
off again until they are confirmed to be meeting safety standards," a
CAL spokesman said.</P>
      <P>A CAL A-300 aircraft crashed into a building Monday evening,
minutes before it was scheduled to land at Chiang Kai-shek
International Airport in Taoyuan, northern Taiwan, killing 203,
including 182 passengers, 14 crew members, two people residing near
the airport and five others who were in passing cars.</P>
      <P>CAL, the Republic of China's former national flag carrier, now
has nine Airbus aircraft in its fleet and has plans to order three
more from France as part of its expansion project, according to Liu

(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Ethnic Chinese Indonesians, alarmed by
rioting in several places, are trying to seek refuge in Australia in
the wake of rising violence against Chinese targets as a result of
growing food prices and unemployment in the world's biggest Islamic
nation.</P>
      <P>In a dispatch from Jakarta Tuesday, the mass circulation
newspaper The Sydney Morning Herald reported inquiries about resident
visas to Australia by ethnic Chinese Indonesians have jumped at least
100 percent in recent weeks as Muslim food riots hit Chinese shops,
temples, churches and houses.</P>
      <P>The daily reported ethnic Chinese have become the scapegoats for
Indonesia's economic crisis because they dominate trade and business
although their number makes up only 3 percent of the total population
of more than 200 million.</P>
      <P>The daily quoted an unnamed immigration agent in Jakarta as
revealing that the recent riots were the worst violence against
Indonesia's ethnic Chinese since the bloodshed of 1965, when some
500,000 people were killed.</P>
      <P>"All the ethnic Chinese are worried -- if you are on the street
when a riot breaks out, you don't know what will happen to you," the
agent said.</P>
      <P>"It is already happening, but not yet in Jakarta," he added.</P>
      <P>Many of those inquiring about Australian visas are middle-class
professionals or small-business owners who have sufficient capital to
be accepted as business migrants, the agent told the daily.</P>
      <P>The wealthier Chinese, who could qualify more easily, could
afford private security and are less at risk, the agent said.</P>
      <P>"So immigration is not necessarily a solution, either. The ones
at the greatest risk are the least likely to get a visa," he said.</P>
      <P>The Australian Embassy in Jakarta reported 132 business migration
approvals for December for Chinese Indonesians, compared with 30 to
40 in previous months.</P>
      <P>Many Chinese Indonesians settle in Perth, which is less than four
hours by air from Jakarta.</P>
      <P>The daily quoted one Chinese businessman as saying, "We know that
if there is a riot in Jakarta ... there will be blood spilled." The
riots made him very angry, but he said he could understand the
frustration of those Indonesians who were suffering from the economic
crisis.</P>
      <P>The daily also quoted Jakarta-based economist Michael Backman as
saying: "The Chinese minority are under pressure at the best of times
in Indonesia; now you have an intolerable amount of anger directed
against them.</P>
      <P>"If there was a complete meltdown in Indonesia and they started
coming to Australia, they may have a reasonable claim for refugee
status because they could demonstrate that the State of Indonesia has
laws constraining Chinese culture and beliefs, and now you have the
physical danger element with the rioting and the property damage," he
said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ASIAN CRISIS FORCES ETHNIC CHINESE FAMILY CONGLOMERATES TO CHANGE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Feb. 17 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Asian economic crisis, globalization
and brand values are forcing many ethnic Chinese family conglomerates
in Asia to change the way they do business in order to survive.</P>
      <P>In an article published in the mass circulation newspaper The
Australian on Tuesday, the daily's Asia business editor Geoff Hiscock
noted that as the Asian economic crisis continues to unfold, the old
"buy and hoard" mentality that dominates the thinking of Chinese
family conglomerates in key business centers such as Bangkok,
Jakarta, Manila, Taipei, Hong Kong and Singapore is giving way to a
new focus: protect the core business.</P>
      <P>He said the 60 million ethnic Chinese who live outside
mainland China have been among the key drivers of rapid economic
growth in Southeast Asia for the past three decades.</P>
      <P>Their easy cross-border access to capital, their commercial
intelligence networks, their willingness to work hard in trying
conditions, their emphasis on family solidarity and the often iron
discipline of a patriarch have brought them fortune and fame.</P>
      <P>He said: "...The key Chinese business leaders today are the sons
and daughters of the huaqiao, the `sojourners' who left southern
China's Fujian and Guangdong provinces in the 19th and 20th centuries
to establish commercial footholds in rice, rubber, tobacco, sugar,
timber and palm oil plantations in the rich `south sea' lands of
Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand and Indochina."</P>
      <P>He said the success in agribusiness and commodity trading
encouraged these entrepreneurial families to expand into shipping
ventures, banking, property development, manufacturing, distribution
and later, media and telecommunications.</P>
      <P>In the postwar era, the men who are now the most influential
figures in the ethnic Chinese business networks of Southeast Asia --
billionaires like Robert Kuok, Liem Sioe Liong, Quek Leng Chan,
Alfonso Yuchengco, Dhanin Chearavanont and Chatri Sophonpanich -- did
deals together and forged networks built on shared origins of clan,
guild, village or dialect.</P>
      <P>For some members of the Chinese business elite, political and
military patronage in Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia and the
Philippines, enshrined their commercial primacy, even if the downside
was a life often lived in fear of violent ethnic envy.</P>
      <P>But a business model built on guanxi (connections), cronyism and
opaque finances, while it worked in earlier decades, is not
necessarily the best approach in the late 1990s, when globalization,
brand values and the economic crisis that began to pound Southeast
Asia last July have put the spotlight on lax lending, speculation,
corruption and mutual backscratching, Hiscock said.</P>
      <P>He said ethnic Chinese families who once grew their businesses in
a price-driven acquisitive fashion, with no thought of Western
buzzwords like synergy, are now looking to rationalize their
portfolios. For some it is a matter of necessity; for others it is a
chance to free up cash that can be used to snap up assets that better
dovetail with their core businesses, Hiscock said.</P>
      <P>The Asian crisis is offering these families the chance to buy
shaky conglomerates in South Korea, and the asset-rich but
confidence-poor Japanese -- along with Australian, European and US
multinationals looking to cherry-pick some cheap assets from the
rubble.</P>
      <P>He said cashed-up Taiwanese families, led by prominent bankers
such as Jeffrey Koo of Chinatrust Commercial Bank in Taipei, are also
on the acquisition trail.</P>
      <P>In a marketing sense, Japan and Korea have shown it can be done
with Toyota, Sony, Samsung and Hyundai, while Taiwan has worked hard
to get Acer into the world's consciousness. But outside of a few
luxury boutique names and some food brands, the ethnic Chinese
entrepreneurs have been singularly unsuccessful.</P>
      <P>The other challenge for the Chinese networks is globalization.
The founders' Western-educated children, armed with MBAs from
Harvard, Wharton and other famous schools, will have to carry the
fight because their parents have no idea how to do so, he said.</P>
      <P>Hiscock said the new Asian focus on core business and the more
competitive globalized world will severely test what until now has
been a highly successful business model.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BRITISH COLUMBIA PREMIER MEETS MAINLAND CHINA DISSIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  Feb. 17 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Exiled dissident Wei Jingsheng of mainland
China visited British Columbia on Monday to talk about human rights
in his communist-controlled country. But he admitted there isn't much
one province can do.</P>
      <P>"Western countries need to work out a scheme of economic
blackmail to force China to respect human rights," the Canadian Press
quoted Wei as saying during a meeting with B.C. Premier Glen Clark.</P>
      <P>"The Chinese Communist Party employs trade as a means to
influence foreign powers to do their bidding," he said through an
interpreter.</P>
      <P>The West's refusal to pressure the mainland about human rights
abuses has encouraged the Beijing leadership, he said on the last
stop of a Canadian visit. He visited Ottawa and Toronto before coming
to Vancouver.</P>
      <P>Clark didn't make any promises, saying economic sanctions aren't
the only solution and trade and reform in mainland China "are not
mutually exclusive." That's exactly the same tune pitched by Canada's
federal leaders.</P>
      <P>Wei wants Canada to speak out when the United Nations Human
Rights Commission discusses mainland China's human rights record in
April.</P>
      <P>The Globe and Mail on Tuesday printed a question-and-answer
session with Wei in Toronto. In the discussions, Wei was quoted as
saying: "Communist governments never bow to logic, only pressure."</P>
      <P>He urged Western countries not to be afraid of "retaliation" by
mainland China if they sponsor a UN resolution to denounce mainland
China's human rights record.</P>
      <P>"Last year, when Denmark sponsored the resolution criticizing
China, China threatened to cancel Danish contracts. But if you look
at the record over the past year, Chinese trade with Denmark has
increased. The Chinese economy is still underdeveloped, and they
cannot afford to discontinue trade with Western nations," he told the
newspaper.</P>
      <P>What are the five things Wei would do if he were president of
mainland China? He said: "First, eliminate corruption. Two, go after
the money that has been stashed away overseas because of corruption.
Three, reform the military to make it a defense force instead of a
tool of repression. Four, allow freedom of expression so that people
can openly discuss national issues. Fifth, improve our relationships
with the democratic and freedom-loving countries of the world."</P>

night, estimated at about NT$1.44 billion (US$43.63 million) looks
set to be a record high in Taiwan, according to the Insurance
Department under the Ministry of Financial Affairs.</P>
      <P>The insurance coverage for the ill-fated airplane itself, an
Airbus 300, is US$71.5 million, underwritten jointly by three local
property insurance firms, in addition to uncapped liability insurance
covering injury to people, damage to cargo, and property both aboard
and on the ground, according to documents released on Tuesday by the
Insurance Department.</P>
      <P>Under the Warsaw Convention which provides guidelines for
compensation for aviation passengers, the maximum indemnity is NT$1.5

      <P>Four victims from one family paid their flight fares via Diner
credit card and automatically enjoy flight insurance of NT$16 million

    <HEADLINE>TAIPEI-WASHINGTON WTO TALKS BOTTLENECKED OVER RICE TRADE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  17 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The 17th round of Taipei-Washington talks
on Taiwan's bid for World Trade Organization (WTO) membership, which
opened in Washington last Monday, have stalled on thorny issues
relating to rice import quotas, with negotiators from both sides
reluctant to yield to demands from the other, according to the
Council of Agriculture, (AOA)</P>
      <P>Rice, a staple food of most of the people of Taiwan, has long
been provided by some 300,000 local farmers who continue the
ancestral industry which is commonly seen as having been the basis of
Taiwan's economic development.</P>
      <P>In order to preserve the industry and farmers' livelihoods, the
domestic rice market is closed to free trade, but Taiwan can no
longer neglect outsiders' demands for an opening of this market if
the nation wants to join in the largest trade and economic
organization in the world and enjoy the profitable opportunities this
will bring, COA officials said.</P>
      <P>During a series of WTO negotiations with the US, an influential
WTO member and one of the world's largest agricultural producers,
Taiwan has often found itself on the horns of a dilemma.</P>
      <P>American negotiators' are demanding a free rice trade without
official interference, but Taiwan's agriculture officials can only
promise "limited imports" based on the Japan model.</P>
      <P>Like Taiwan, Japan is also a nation of rice consumers which had
to fight for its rice interests during its own WTO entry talks. It
eventually won a "yielded program."</P>
      <P>According to the COA's open schedule for opening the rice market,
in order to reduce the impact of imported rice, 90 percent of
imported rice should be controlled by the government, while the other
10 percent is opened to private importers.</P>
      <P>COA has also proposed that, based on the Japanese model, Taiwan
will open 4 percent of its annual domestic consumption to foreign
import in the first year after WTO accession, the figure increasing
0.8 percent per year until it reaches 8 percent.</P>
      <P>However, Washington rejects this arrangement, declaring that the
4 percent opening level for Japan was enacted in 1995, when it
started to open its rice market, and that based on the 0.8 percentage
increase, it's 1998 import quota will be 6.4 percent. According to
Washington officials, Taiwan's first-year rice import quota should be
the same as Japan's current quota -- 6.4 percent, assuming Taiwan is
granted entry this year.</P>
      <P>Agricultural officials on the island told the CNA on Tuesday that
no consensus on the current talks will be reached if the two sides
fail to submit a compromise program for the rice issue over the next
few days.</P>
      <P>The US is one of the four remaining WTO contracting parties which
have not concluded discussions with Taipei on membership
requirements. The others are Canada, Switzerland and the European
Union.</P>
      <P>Taiwan, under the name "The Customs Territory of Taiwan, Penghu,
Kinmen and Matsu," in 1990 applied to join the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade, which was succeeded by the WTO in 1995.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Gambian President Yahya A. J.
J. Jammeh on Wednesday reaffirmed his firm commitment to the Republic
of China, saying he will continue to speak for the ROC's bid to join
the United Nations and other international organizations during his
tenure.</P>
      <P>Jammeh made the remarks while meeting with ROC Minister of
Foreign Affairs Jason Hu, who arrived in the Gambia for a brief visit
on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Jammeh said ROC President Lee Teng-hui is welcome to visit the
Gambia at any time of his convenience. President Lee is scheduled to
embark on an African diplomatic tour later this year. His itinerary
is expected to include Senegal, Guinea-Bissau, the Gambia and
Burkina Fasso.</P>
      <P>Senior Gambian officials confirmed that the two countries have
drafted plans for Lee's Gambia visit. "We'll make public Lee's
itinerary in the Gambia after it is formally finalized," Gambian
Vice President Zsatou Njie-Saidy said.</P>
      <P>Hu attended a cocktail reception in celebration the Gambia's
National Day shortly after his arrival in the West African state for
a whirlwind visit.</P>
      <P>This is the third leg of Hu's current six-country African
diplomatic swing aimed at shoring up the ROC's relations with his
allies in the region in the wake of the switch of diplomatic
recognition from Taipei to Beijing by South Africa and the Central
African Republic earlier this year.</P>
      <P>Hu already visited Chad and Guinea-Bissau. He will also travel
to Liberia, Sao Tome and Principe as well as Burkina Faso before his
return to Taipei next Monday. His two previous African trips in
recent months took him to Senegal, Swazilandand Malawi.</P>
      <P>Hu said he plans to visit all of the ROC's African allies in the
possible shortest period of time and will then come up with a
comprehensive report on feasible measures to further expand exchanges
and cooperation with those countries.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GULF TENSION MAY DRIVE UP OIL PRICES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  18  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Tensions appear to be building in the
Persian Gulf with the United States expressing its intention to
attack Iraq if it continues to block weapons inspections, the
Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The MOEA's Research and Development Commission said an outbreak
of military confrontation in the Gulf region is not expected to
affect Taiwan's crude oil supply because the country has
successfully diversified its import sources.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, the commission said, military actions in the Gulf
region could trigger a rally of the US dollar in the international
monetary markets. "A rise in the greenback's value would add our
crude import costs," said a commission official.</P>
      <P>The official said if the US-Iraq tensions over weapons
inspections can be eased soon, international crude oil price will
maintain at the current levels, ranging between US$16 and US$17 per
barrel. But if the situation continues to worsen, oil price may rise
to US$18 per barrel.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan's oil supplies are based on long-term contracts, the
official said, moderate price fluctuation in the international crude
market will not result in a drastic rise in domestic oil prices.</P>
      <P>Despite escalating tensions in the Gulf region, international
crude oil prices have so far remained stable because of a continued
glut in the market, the official said.</P>
      <P>Thanks to successful diversification of import sources, Taiwan
has lowered its dependence on the Middle East for the supply of
crude oil in recent years.</P>
      <P>Taiwan used to import up to 84 percent of its annual oil demand
from Middle East countries, but the rate has dropped to 59 percent by
now. Among Middle East countries, Saudi Arabia accounts for 28
percent of Taiwan's total annual crude oil imports; Kuwait, 10
percent; Iran, 7 percent; the United Arab Emirates, 7 percent; and
Oman, 3 percent. Taiwan doesn't import crude oil from Iraq.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chinese Petroelum Corp. (CPC), a state monopoly, has
consistently maintained a crude oil stockpile enough for 60 to 90
days of domestic consumption.</P>
      <P>Even if the Persian Gulf comes under a blockade because of
military confrontation, the official said, Taiwan can take delivery
of contracted crude oil from Red Sea ports.</P>
      <P>Against this background, the official said, domestic oil supply
will not be affected by a Gulf war.</P>
      <P>However, he said, the eruption of a war in the region may spark
appreciation of the US dollar, which will lead to increases in CPC's
oil import costs.</P>
      <P>According to CPC estimates, the company's oil import costs will
increase NT$500 million to NT$600 million per month if the local
currency depreciates NT$1 against the greenback.</P>
      <P>The official said the Economics Ministry will keep a close watch
on the developments in the Gulf region and will adopt timely
measures to cope with any emergency situation.</P>
      <P>The ministry has also allowed the CPC to implement a floating
pricing system to let market mechanism determine domestic oil
prices, the official added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AUSTRALIA RULES OUT INTEREST RATE CUTS IN FACE OF ASIAN CRISIS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Feb.  18 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has
ruled out bank interest rate cuts due to its concerns about the
impact of the Asian financial crisis on the local currency and
economic growth rate.</P>
      <P>In its quarterly economic report, the RBA warned that the Asian
crisis will slow the Australian economic growth rate despite the fact
that Australia has so far avoided the worst of the Asian crisis.</P>
      <P>The RBA said its immediate tactical priority is to insulate
Australia from the financial turmoil that has engulfed other
economies in the Asian region.</P>
      <P>"Monetary policy will be directed toward the continuance of the
low-inflation expansion that the economy has experienced since the
early 1990s," the RBA said.</P>
      <P>"In the period ahead, the pursuit of these medium-term objectives
will require policy to place a good deal of importance on fostering
financial market stability. Australia has done well to avoid the
worst of the financial turmoil that has characterized our region over
the past 12 months -- continuing to do so must be a high priority,"
it said.</P>
      <P>The RBA statement, released Tuesday, has killed growing financial
expectations of another interest rate cut, fueled by recent figures
showing signs of weakness in the economy, continued low inflation and
slow wage growth.</P>
      <P>The RBA reduced interest rates five times between July 1996 and
July 1997, reducing the official rate to 5 percent from 7.5 percent.</P>
      <P>The RBA statement helped the Australian dollar to become stable,
closing slightly higher at 66.75 US cents from Monday's closing level
of 66.55 US cents.</P>
      <P>The All Ordinaries Index also closed 35.8 points higher to finish
at 2657 on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Ted Evans, secretary of the Federal Treasury, also warned that
the Australian economy would slow this year because of the Asian
economic crisis, which is slowing demand for imports from Australia
and elsewhere.</P>
      <P>"The Asian crisis will slow the growth that otherwise would have
been obtainable in Australia and, as forecast, put pressure on our
current account," he said.</P>
      <P>Treasurer Peter Costello said Australia's strong domestic economy
would counteract the downturn on the external front caused by the
Asian crisis.</P>
      <P>But economists said he was too optimistic, saying the Asian
crisis would cut Australia's gross domestic product growth by about
one percentage point this year.</P>
      <P>Australia's GDP was earlier set to grow more than 4 percent
before the Asian crisis. But the growth rate now has to be set at
around 3 percent, the economists said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BLACK MARKET DISRUPTING BEIJING'S PROMISE NOT TO DEVALUE YUAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Feb.  18 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The black market in foreign currency is
alive and well in mainland China and is disrupting Beijing's promise
not to devalue its yuan so as not to deepen the Asian currency
crisis.</P>
      <P>In a dispatch from Hong Kong, The Australian Financial Review,
Australia's leading business daily, reported on Wednesday that black
marketeers' calls of "Change money, US dollars?" are rampant again in
mainland China and that the exchange rate between the yuan and the US
dollar has approached nine yuan to one US dollar, compared to the
official selling price of 8.29 yuan to one greenback.</P>
      <P>The black market is trading billions of US dollars a day,
according to the daily, which quoted the Business Weekly edition of
the China Daily.</P>
      <P>The Review reported most analysts think that for now Beijing will
stand behind the yuan's steady rate of the last three years -- around
8.2 to US$1.00 -- for a host of economic and political reasons that
are most unlikely to be derailed, at least in 1998.</P>
      <P>The Review even quoted mainland Chinese Vice Premier Zhu Rongji
as saying, "I can solemnly swear the Chinese currency will not be
devalued." Zhu will replace Li Peng as premier next month.</P>
      <P>The Review reported, however, that the black market is proving
hard to kill off. It has been revived by recent rumors of
depreciation as other Asian currencies have collapsed, recalling the
profits made by the massive devaluation of 1994 when dual foreign
exchange systems in the mainland were merged and succored by the
limited official convertibility of the yuan and mainland China's much
increased contacts with the wider world.</P>
      <P>The daily reported some mainland Chinese people use the black
market to launder illegally earned money and some use it to speculate
for profit taking.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EAST ASIAN 'MIRACLE' WAS REAL: WORLD BANK OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Geneva,  Feb. 17 (CNA)
(By Maurus Young)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The East Asian "miracle" was real, and its
economic transformation of East Asia has been one of the most
remarkable accomplishments in history, said Joseph Stiglitz, vice
president and chief economist of the World Bank.</P>
      <P>In an article he contributed to the Wall Street Journal, Stiglitz
pointed out that the dramatic surge in gross domestic product that
East Asian countries brought about is reflected in higher standards
of living for hundreds of million of Asians, including longer life
expectancy and better health and education, and that millions of
others have rescued themselves from poverty and now lead more hopeful
lives.</P>
      <P>"These achievements are real and will be far more permanent than
the present turmoil," he said.</P>
      <P>The East Asian miracle's impact on poverty is probably one of its
most striking features. In 1975, six out of 10 Asians lived on less
than US$1 a day. In Indonesia, the absolute poverty rate was even
higher. Today, two out of 10 East Asians are living in absolute
poverty. South Korea, Malaysia and Thailand have eliminated absolute
poverty, and Indonesia is within striking distance of that goal. The
United States and other Western countries, which have also seen solid
growth over the past 20 years but little reduction in their poverty
rates, could well learn from the East Asian experience, Stiglitz
said.</P>
      <P>Once held up as models for other developing countries, today
legions of critics are condemning the East Asian countries for their
unworkable economic systems that they say were always bound to
collapse into crisis. This dramatic swing in public opinion, matching
the dramatic changes in the markets, has gone further than is
justified by the fundamentals, he said, pointing out that no other
economic system has delivered so much, to so many, in so short a span
of time.</P>
      <P>Stiglitz reminded his readers that financial and currency crises
have occurred elsewhere in the world, most recently in Scandinavian
countries such as Norway, Sweden and Finland. The fact that these
countries had highly transparent economic systems and advanced
institutional frameworks demonstrates that transparency is not enough
to underpin robust financial systems, he said.</P>
      <P>Although the lack of transparency in the East Asian economies
contributed to the problems, it is probably not responsible for the
crisis itself, he said.</P>
      <P>At the same time, the crisis in the East Asian countries is very
different from crisis experienced by many developing countries in the
past, Stiglitz noted. The East Asian countries have all run budget
surpluses or minimal budget deficits in recent years.</P>
      <P>Stiglitz asserted that the financial crisis in East Asia can be
understood as the result of a number of factors that have made these
economies especially vulnerable to a sudden withdrawal of confidence.
The problems -- including misallocation of investment,
maturity/currency mismatch of assets and liabilities, and, in the
case of South Korea, very high debt-equity ratios -- are rooted in
private-sector financial decisions, he said.</P>
      <P>Stiglitz stressed that "restoring growth in East Asia requires
restoring confidence."</P>
      <P>"This is as much a matter of perception as of reality, including
the perception of the fundamental strengths of the East Asian
economies and their resolve to address their weaknesses," he said.</P>
      <P>"At the same time," he continued, "governments and international
institutions, including the World Bank, have the responsibility for
ensuring that the poor and vulnerable suffer as little as possible in
the process of adjustment."</P>

    <HEADLINE>HAZE COULD RETURN TO S'PORE BY MARCH IF FIRES CONTINUE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  Feb.  18  (CNA)
(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The haze could return to Singapore as
early as next month or April if forest fires continue to burn in
Indonesia.</P>
      <P>The Singapore Meteorological Service said that as wind direction
becomes unpredictable in those two inter-monsoon months, Singapore
could experience haze on several days.</P>
      <P>How thick it gets will depend on the extent of the fires in
Indonesia.</P>
      <P>With a week to go to till ASEAN environment ministers meet in
Kuching, East Malaysia, to discuss a regional plan to prevent a
repeat of last year's haze, the Indonesian authorities are reporting
widespread fires in Kalimantan.</P>
      <P>Antara, the Indonesian national news agency, reported there were
895 fires in East Kalimantan as of Sunday night, compared with 618 a
day earlier.</P>
      <P>On the prospect of the smoke haze reaching Singapore, a
Meteorological Service official was quoted as saying, "Assuming the
fires go on burning, we could get slight haze in March or April over
Singapore."</P>
      <P>He explained that the current northeast monsoon is expected to
weaken over the next week or two.</P>
      <P>Before the southwest monsoon starts in May, there is what is
called the inter-monsoon period, when wind direction is quite
unpredictable.</P>
      <P>He said that even in normal non-El Nino years, Singapore did
experience slight haze too, but that it varied year to year.</P>
      <P>Looking further ahead, he said there was a high chance of normal
weather conditions returning by June, when the El Nino phenomenon
tails off.</P>
      <P>El Nino results from a warming of the Pacific Ocean off South
America. It brings heavy rainfall and flooding to some parts of the
world and extreme drought to others.</P>
      <P>The southwest monsoon usually blows from June to October and
coincides with Indonesia's dry season. But last year was
exceptionally dry, worsening the situation.</P>

    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Feb.  18  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Asian crisis will not only hit
defense budgets in Asian countries but also shift the regional
balance of power toward mainland China, according to Australian
experts.</P>
      <P>They said they believe there will be massive cuts in the Asian
military budgets and the likelihood of increased instability in the
region. Nearly all Southeast Asian nations, except Singapore, are
suddenly facing defense budget cuts of up to 20 percent, straining
cooperative defense relations and placing constraints on what other
countries are able to do militarily.</P>
      <P>Australian defense officials said, "The cuts in defense budgets
in countries in our region mean we'll have to work harder to retain
bilateral relations."</P>
      <P>They said that mainland China, which has been little affected by
the Asian economic crisis so far, would become stronger militarily as
other Asian countries become weaker due to defense budget cuts.</P>
      <P>Professor Paul Dibb of the Australian National University in
Canberra said: "The relative weakening of the Malaysian and Thai
economies is not a good thing given that China is rising and showing
leadership. Therefore the regional balance of power could move
toward China."</P>
      <P>Other experts noted the Asian crisis has forced an urgent
reassessment of Australia's latest strategic defense review because
the instability of the Asian region is expected to increase due to
such massive cuts in defense budgets.</P>
      <P>Australia's senior defense officials believe the region will
return to robust levels of economic growth only in the medium to long
term.</P>

    <DATELINE>Jakarta,  Feb.  18  (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>B.J. Habibie only needs the Indonesian
armed forces' nod to make his vice presidential nomination a forgone
conclusion in the wake of Indonesia's 27 governors lining up behind
him Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The regional leaders' endorsement means that Habibie, the state
minister of research and technology, has secured the backing of four
of the five factions in the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR).</P>
      <P>The governors form the regional representatives faction in the
Assembly, Indonesia's highest law-making body, which elects the
president and vice president.</P>
      <P>The Moslem-oriented United Development Party, the dominant Golkar
and the minority Indonesian Democratic Party have all fielded the
technology tsar as their sole candidate.</P>
      <P>"Our decision on Habibie's nomination is final," Minister of Home
Affairs Moch. Yogie S.M. was quoted by the Antara news agency as
saying after chairing the governors' meeting.</P>
      <P>Yogie, who supervises the MPR's regional representatives faction
and Golkar's bureaucrats, said Habibie's vice presidential nomination
was decided by the three elements that form the backbone of Golkar:
the armed forces, the bureaucracy and mass organizations affiliated
to the political grouping.</P>
      <P>"Originally, the bureaucrats had two names for the vice
presidency -- Harmoko and Habibie," he said, "but then Harmoko
withdrew his (decision to accept the) nomination."</P>
      <P>Yogie said that the result of the meeting had also been reported
to the chairman of Golkar's board of patrons, President Suharto.</P>
      <P>"The president asked the regional representatives faction to
formally nominate Habibie in the MPR," he said.</P>
      <P>Habibie said all the MPR factions' support for him was "really an
honor."</P>
      <P>"It'll be an honor for me to assist the elected president," he
told reporters after accompanying Suharto at a state function at the
State Palace Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Speaking about senior economist Emil Salim's bid for the vice
presidency, Yogie said the former minister was free to go on with his
campaign.</P>
      <P>"But our candidate is only one, Habibie," he said.</P>
      <P>On Monday, noted figures Herawan Diah, Nelly Adam Malki and
Saparinah Sadli -- on behalf of 128 scholars and public figures
seeking Emil's nomination -- presented their petition to the MPR
regional representatives faction.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GOVERNMENT ADJUSTS GROWTH DOWNWARD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  18  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Affected by the Asian financial turmoil
that has challenged global economies over the past few months,
Taiwan's economy will grow slower this year than previously expected,
down from the originally-estimated 6.5 percent to 6.2 percent, the
government's statistics agency reported Monday.</P>
      <P>According to Wei Duan, director-general of the Directorate
General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS), Taiwan's
economy will continue to expand steadily this year and will feature
"moderate growth, with a low unemployment rate and inflation
well-controlled."</P>
      <P>1998 will also reveal whether Taiwan's economy is crisis-proof,
Wei said, citing the Chinese proverb that declares that a horse's
strength is known only when the way is long.</P>
      <P>With the downgrading of Taiwan's economic growth rate come
readjustments in other figures, Wei noted. Inflation is now expected
to grow at 3.10 percent this year, down slightly from previous
estimates of 3.12 percent, while the wholesale price index is
expected to rise by 5.7 percent, up from the originally-forecast 5.3
percent, he said.</P>
      <P>DGBAS researchers also cut back substantially the estimated gross
national product (GNP) for this year, down to US$273.4 billion from
last year's US$285.3 billion, and targeted the per capita GNP at
US$12,586 in 1998, as compared with the US$13,245 forecast previously
and the US$13,233 Taiwan posted in 1997.</P>
      <P>Wei attributed the downward readjustment to slowing exports on
the part of Taiwan and the regionwide recession. Asia suffered
economic stagnation in the first half of last year and a financial
crisis in the second half.</P>
      <P>The Asian economic turbulence, which has challenged world
economies, has prompted leading economic forecast institutes to make
major downward readjustments of global growth. For example, Wei said,
the Wharton Econometric Forecasting Association forecast recently
that Japan's economy will grow a mere 0.8 percent this year, while
that of the United States will score a growth of 2.5 percent and
South Korea's will drop 2 percent.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan people made 143,000 visits to Canada
in 1997, up 5.8 percent from 1996, according to Canadian tourism
officials.</P>
      <P>There were sharp increases in the numbers of tourists to Canada
from Taiwan, Britain and the United States, the officials said,
describing these as "major sources" of Canada's foreign tourists.</P>
      <P>In contrast, other major sources have recorded marked decreases,
most notably Hong Kong and Japan, where the drops were 27 and 13
percent respectively in 1997 from the previous year's levels, they
said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan was Canada's eighth largest source of foreign tourists
(excluding the United States), following Britain, Japan, France,
Germany, Australia, South Korea and Hong Kong. The Netherlands and
Italy rounded out the top 10.</P>
      <P>The tourism officials said that 17.6 million tourists visited
Canada last year, up 1.6 percent from the previous year, with US
citizens comprising 13.3 million of the total.</P>
      <P>The fluctuation of world currencies and the economic crisis in
Asia have affected the tourism market, they said, noting that
Canada's tourist arrivals from Japan, Germany, France and other
European countries have decreased comparatively and that all of those
countries' currencies have depreciated against the US dollar.</P>
      <P>Asian countries' attempts to persuade their nationals not to take
overseas trips to save foreign currency have also contributed to the
reduction in tourists to Canada, the officials said.</P>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Experts on Wednesday went to the crash site
of China Airlines flight 676, Taiwan's worst aviation disaster which
killed all 196 on board as well as six others on the ground.</P>
      <P>Officials from Taiwan's Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA),
representatives from the French Airbus Industrie, maker of the doomed
Airbus A-300, as well as experts from France's Bureau Enquetes
Accidents which helps investigate aviation accidents, arrived on
Wednesday afternoon at the crash site in Taoyuan County, northern
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>After two consecutive days of rain, the wreckage scattered around
the scene of the accident seemed in even more tragic disarray.</P>
      <P>They scrutinized the crash site, took notes, videotaped and
photographed of the debris. They sifted through the wreckage to
gather every possible clue to help find out the cause of the crash.</P>
      <P>The wreckage of the plane was scattered over a wide area
after the plane aborted a landing in fog and then veered off course
to crash into a residential area.</P>
      <P>The experts heard a briefing by CAA officials in the morning at
the CAA building, where they first observed a minute's silence in
memory of the victims.</P>
      <P>CAA officials provided the weather forecast, the recording of the
conversation between the pilots and the control tower at Chiang
Kai-shek International Airport before the crash, a map of the
wreckage of the plane, and a history of the plane's regular repair
and maintenance records.</P>
      <P>The officials also reported that autopsies already carried out on
the bodies of Kang Lung-lin and Chiang Teh-shen, the pilot and
co-pilot, found no trace of alcohol or drugs in their systems.</P>
      <P>The French experts said they will give a three-week intensive
safety course to CAL's Airbus pilots in the near future, while the
CAA on Tuesday ordered all CAL's Airbus planes to be grounded for
safety checks.</P>
      <P>They also expressed the hope that the aircraft's "black box," the
cockpit voice recorder and digital flight data recorders, will be
sent overseas for analysis as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>They refused to comment further on the accident, saying only that
the present information could not confirm the cause of the crash.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, CAL officials said two ringing sounds heard during the
conversation between the pilots and the control tower just before the
plane went down at 8:07 p.m. could indicate that the pilots were
trying to switch from auto pilot to manual control, which they said
is normal procedure.</P>
      <P>Whether the timing for switching off the auto pilot was
appropriate will not be clear until the black box information has
been analyzed, they said.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 18 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's two-way trade amounted to US$24.75
billion in the first six weeks of this year, down 4 percent, or
US$1.04 billion, from the year-earlier level, the Ministry of Finance
(MOF) reported on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Between Jan. 1 and Feb. 14, Taiwan posted accumulated exports of
US$12.086 billion and imports of US$12.661 billion, leaving the
country with a deficit of US$575 million during the period, officials
from the MOF's Department of Statistics said.</P>
      <P>MOF officials attributed the deficit increase to considerable
imports of aircraft by both the private and military sectors, as well
as increased imports of crude oil by the Chinese Petroleum Corp.</P>
      <P>However, the depreciation of the New Taiwan dollar in the latter
part of 1997 means that two-way trade recorded in the Jan. 1-Feb. 14
period was much larger than that posted in the same period of 1997 if
calculated in local currency, the officials pointed out.</P>
      <P>During the 45-day period, the island's two-way trade amounted to
NT$821.39 billion, up 16 percent, or NT$113.33 billion, over the

    <HEADLINE>9TH NATIONAL PEOPLE'S CONGRESS TO SEE QUIAO SHI'S INFLUENCE DIMINISHED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  18  (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Qiao Shi, Standing Committee chairman of
mainland China's 8th National People's Congress, has long been
considered to be mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin's sole
potential rival, but his influence in the political and legal fields
will soon be swept away.</P>
      <P>According to the Hong Kong-based Ming-Pao Daily News, Luo Gan,
Secretary-General of mainland China's State Council and a crony of
Premier Li Peng, is set to replace Qiao's crony Ren Jianxin as
secretary of the Central Commission of Political Science and Law of
the Communist Party of China (CPC) in the 9th National People's
Congress which will be held in March. Meanwhile, Jiang, who is also
CPC General Secretary, is demanding a counter-corruption movement to
be conducted against judicial organizations.</P>
      <P>In view of the above developments, political analysts have
observed, Qiao's influence in the fields of political science and
law, which was established during his membership in the CPC's Central
Commission of Political Science and Law, will diminish.</P>
      <P>After former deputy secretary Luo Gan assumes his post as
secretary of the Central Commission of Political Science and Law,
Qiao's faction, such as Ren, who concurrently serves as president of
the Supreme People's Court, and Procurator-General of the Supreme
People's Procuratorate Zhang Siqing, will all retreat to the second
line of the hierarchy.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, in a break with tradition, they will not be
allocated posts as members of the Standing Committee of the National
People's Congress; instead, they will be made standing members of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.</P>
      <P>According to informed sources, Luo's new appointment bears
evidence that after Li Peng takes the chair of the Standing Committee
of the National People's Congress, he will use the congress to expand
his own influence on mainland Chinese political affairs and
consolidate his power in the fields of politics and law, just as Qiao
did before.</P>
      <P>Other sources have remarked that the Beijing authorities have
accelerated their appeal on the counter-corruption movement against
judicial organizations since the end of last year, pointing out that
this is also aimed at cutting Qiao's influence on the mainland's
political and legal systems.</P>

      <P>China Airlines on Wednesday announced that
it was canceling seven domestic flights between southern Taiwan's
Kaohsiung and the capital, Taipei, as well as 10 international
flights, after Taiwan's Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) demanded that
all of the company's Airbus A-300/600R planes must be grounded for
safety checks.</P>
      <P>The demand came after a CAL A-300 aircraft crashed on Monday
evening while approaching Chiang Kai-shek International Airport in
Taoyuan, northern Taiwan, claiming 203 lives including that of
Central Bank of China Governor Sheu Yuan-dong. The crash marked the
nation's worst-ever air disaster.</P>
      <P>In light of the fact that the plane is the same type as the CAL
plane which crashed at Japan's Nagoya airport on April 26, 1994,
killing 264 of the 271 aboard, the Ministry of Transportation and
Communications has ordered a ban on all flights by Airbus planes
until complete checks can be carried out to confirm their complete
safety.</P>
      <P>At present, there are nine Airbus planes in Taiwan, all of which
belong to CAL, the former national flag carrier. CAL officials said
that in accordance with the ban, they will suspend another seven
flights between Taiwan and Southeast Asia scheduled for Thursday.</P>
      <P>They said the company's Boeing 737, Boeing 747 and MD-11 aircraft
are shouldering the flight services originally provided by the A-300
planes, while the B-737s, which ply mainly domestic routes, will now
cover regional flights.</P>

    <DATELINE>Washington,  Feb.  17 (CNA)
(By Herman Pan and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>ROC Minister of Economic Affairs Wang
Chih-kang met with Deputy US Trade Representative Richard Fisher on
Tuesday for discussions on terms for Taiwan's entry into the World
Trade Organization (WTO).</P>
      <P>Wang said after his 30-minute talks with Fisher that both sides
have a strong desire to end bilateral WTO consultations as soon as
possible. "However, we remain far divided on several critical
issues," he noted, adding that as both sides face heavy pressure at
home, further negotiations are needed to work out mutually acceptable
terms.</P>
      <P>Negotiations have proceeded slowly because American negotiators
have to consult frequently with relevant US agricultural or
industrial associations on various Taiwan-proposed market opening or
tariff reduction measures, Wang said.</P>
      <P>The 17th round of Taiwan-US WTO talks began more than a week ago,
but the two sides have still failed to reach consensus on some thorny
issues, particularly those related to trade in pork and rice.</P>
      <P>Wang said the US negotiators want Taiwan to make larger cuts on
tariff rates for certain sensitive agricultural products and to
increase annual import quotas.</P>
      <P>As the US demands go far beyond Taiwan's bottom line, Wang said,
the current round of talks may have to be extended for one or two
days. "If no compromise can be worked out, we do not rule out the
possibility of ending the meeting and leaving those issues open for
future consultations," the minister said.</P>
      <P>This is the first time the Taiwan delegation has explicitly said
it is prepared for the worst. Taiwan sent a large-scale delegation to
this round of talks with the strong intention of settling all
remaining unsolved issues.</P>
      <P>"As huge gaps still exist between the two sides, we may have to
end this round and meet again at an appropriate time," Wang said,
adding: "We can't make unconditional concessions simply for
concluding the negotiations."</P>
      <P>Wang arrived in Washington, D.C. on Sunday with the aim of
seeking major breakthroughs in the difficult WTO talks. He is
scheduled to meet with US Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky on
Wednesday to exchange views on related issues.</P>
      <P>On Tuesday, Wang also met with Richard Bush, chairman of the
American Institute in Taiwan, for discussions on a range of economic
and financial topics of mutual concern. Bush is the top American
liaison officer with Taiwan in the absence of official ties.</P>
      <P>Wang told Bush that the Republic of China government is willing
to assist in addressing the current Southeast Asian financial crisis.
"We do not have any political motivation in making such offers," Wang
said, adding that Taiwan has consistently maintained close trade and
economic ties with many Southeast Asian countries. "We have invested
heavily in the region and do not want to see it plagued by financial
and economic woes."</P>
      <P>The economic minister also expressed Taiwan's intention to take
part in a US-sponsored meeting of finance ministers and central bank
governors from 22 major economies around the world. The US has
invited several Asian economies to the meeting, tentatively set for
mid-April, but Taiwan has not been included.</P>

      <P>The Cabinet-level Directorate General of
Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) estimated on Wednesday that
fixed domestic private sector investment will grow by 16.6 percent to
hit NT$1 trillion in 1998.</P>
      <P>The DGBAS said growth in 1997 stood at 15.6 percent, predicting
that this year's growth rate will be higher as a result of robust
investment from the private sector in large-scale construction
projects such as power plants, the new high-speed rail system,
warehousing centers, commercial-industrial compounds, high-tech
industrial parks and recreational resorts.</P>
      <P>Domestic demand will be the major force behind Taiwan's economic
growth this year, it added.</P>
      <P>A survey of the manufacturing sector carried out by the DGBAS in
January showed that investment in the sector is expected to increase
by 20 percent this year, with the textile, paper making and

potential.</P>

      <P>The number of ethnic Chinese in Canada
stood at 920,000 as of the end of 1996, comprising 26.9 percent of
the country's 3.2 million "nonwhite minorities," the largest group in
that category, according to a demographic survey released by the
Canadian government on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>According to the statistics, other major nonwhite ethnic groups
living in Canada include South Asians, blacks, West Asians and
Arabians, and Filipinos. Japanese and Koreans totaled around 68,000
and 65,000, respectively.</P>
      <P>Most of the Chinese population resides in the greater Toronto,
Vancouver and Montreal areas, according to the tallies. There are
some 335,000 ethnic Chinese in Toronto, or about one quarter of the
city's total minority population, while the figure in Vancouver is
around 270,900, making up nearly half of that city's minorities.
Another 46,000 Chinese reside in Montreal, accounting for 11.5
percent of its minority population.</P>
      <P>By province, there are 1,400 ethnic Chinese in Newfoundland, some
5,600 in Quebec, 423,000 in Ontario, 98,000 in Alberta, and 312,000

      <P>The sudden burst of hail, caused by a cold front which has

    <DATELINE>Singapore,  Feb. 18 (CNA)
(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Singapore government said Wednesday
it has accepted nearly all the recommendations made by a finance
subcommittee designed to liberalize Singapore's financial sector.</P>
      <P>The Finance and Banking Subcommittee under the Singapore
Competitiveness Study Committee (CSC) released its report on Feb. 2,
in which it made 55 recommendations, covering fund management,
treasury/risk management, equities markets, general debt issuance,
corporate finance and venture capital, insurance and re-insurance,
and cross-border electronic banking.</P>
      <P>Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, who chairs a general
committee on finance, announced the government's response to the
recommendations on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>It said the government has accepted nearly all the subcommittee's
recommendations, other than those dealing with tax matters.</P>
      <P>"The thrust of these recommendations is to liberalize the
financial sector while maintaining high standards of integrity and
supervision, to allow the private sector to play a greater role in
deciding what products to offer, and to let the public decide for
themselves what they want to invest in, and what risks to accept," it
said.</P>
      <P>This coincides with the approach the government has taken in its
review of the financial sector, it added.</P>
      <P>Where further study is necessary, it pointed out, "we have
indicated our agreement in principle or otherwise, so that the
industry is clear on the direction to be taken and the follow-up
necessary."</P>
      <P>The response does not cover the government's decisions on
recommendations which involve tax matters except in cases where the
answer is a clear rejection. The government will study the other tax
issues and announce its decisions in due course, it added.</P>
      <P>Underlying the subcommittee's recommendations, though not
explicitly stated, is the sentiment that the Monetary Authority of
Singapore (MAS) should play a more active promotional role, and
champion the industry's needs with relevant government agencies, e.g.
the ministries of finance and law, which administer relevant areas,
and the Internal Revenues Administration of Singapore (IRAS) for tax
matters.</P>
      <P>MAS plans to set up a financial sector promotion department,
separate from the departments responsible for supervising the
industry. It will work closely with the industry to help bring in new
products, technologies and activities, the announcement said.</P>
      <P>Since Jan. 1 this year, Deputy Prime Minister Lee has also taken
the chairmanship of the MAS, Singapore's de facto central bank.</P>

after the United States and Japan, overseas industry sources said on
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>T.S. Chen, managing director of the US-based PRI Corp., said
Taiwan has the potential to leap ahead of South Korea and become only
the third country to produce sophisticated 12-inch wafers, as Taiwan
semiconductor makers are actively engaged in expansion plans while
South Korean firms have stopped such efforts.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks after his company and three Japanese firms
-- Daifuku, Shinko and Murata -- held a joint seminar at the
Science-based Industrial Park in northern Hsinchu to tout their

      <P>Chen said the event drew enthusiastic response from more than 100
representatives of local integrated circuitry firms, revealing that a

equipment to manufacture semiconductors.</P>
      <P>Chen expressed confidence that the first 12-inch wafer plant will
be soon set up in Taiwan, following in the steps of similar
facilities in the United States and Japan. He said that the first

      <P>According to the estimates by the Industrial Technology Research

      <P>President Lee Teng-hui, in his capacity as

deep condolences over those who perished in Monday night's China

      <P>Lee said in a routine meeting of the party's Central Standing
Committee that his concern is also with the families of the victims
and residents living near the crash site.</P>
      <P>The CAL Airbus A-300 crashed near the Chiang Kai-shek
International Airport in Taoyuan County, northern Taiwan, killing all
196 passengers and crew members onboard as well as six others on the
ground. Part of the ill-fated aircraft slammed into a residential
area, setting a number of houses afire and claiming the lives of the
six and injuring several others.</P>
      <P>At the beginning of the meeting, Lee asked the committee members
to observe one minute of silence in memory of the victims who died in

    <TEXT>
      <P>After the worst-ever aviation disaster in
Taiwan on Monday night, the privatization of China Airlines (CAL) is
seen as more urgent than ever in order to salvage both the airline's
reputation and its operations.</P>
      <P>Hsu Lih-teh, former vice premier and currently chairman of the
government-controlled CAL Foundation, on Wednesday called on the
government to accelerate the privatization process of the CAL, whose
Airbus A-300 en route to Taipei from the resort island of Bali
crashed near the CKS International Airport on Monday night, killing
all 196 passengers and crew onboard as well as six persons on the
ground.</P>
      <P>Hsu said that the CAL Foundation, though holding a 70 percent
stake of the CAL, actually assumes no responsibility for monitoring
operations of the airline, adding that the Ministry of Transportation
and Communications (MOTC) should resolve itself to step up efforts to
privatize the company.</P>
      <P>The status of the CAL is neither official nor private, Hsu said,
pointing out that this brings immense difficulties in the operation
as well as the transformation of the airline. Hsu, who assumed his
post last July, described the CAL as a "company without management,"
and even called it "an orphan that no one cares about."</P>
      <P>Monday's disaster was the CAL's second crash in four years. On
April 26, 1994, the same model of Airbus A-300 crashed at Japan's
Nagoya airport, killing 264 of the 271 persons onboard. The airline's
poor flight safety record is drawing severe criticism from the
public.</P>
      <P>Hsu admitted that the CAL needs improvement in many areas, but
said there is no reason to dissolve the company, as some legislators
have demanded in the wake of the latest accident.</P>
      <P>Hsu claimed that Taiwan residents have strong feelings of loyalty
toward the CAL. In addition, due to considerations of national
interest as well as the legal aspect, the CAL should not be
disbanded, he argued.</P>

      <P>President Lee Teng-hui kicked off the
Taipei International Book Exhibition (TIBE) on Thursday, with a wish
that the Asia's largest book fair will help make Taipei the pivot of
the regional publishing industry and the global center of
Chinese-language reading material.</P>
      <P>Lee said he hopes that by sponsoring the TIBE, Taipei will evolve
into an international copyright exchange hub. He also anticipated
that the book fair will help Taiwan residents develop better reading
habits and thus broaden their horizons.</P>

book fair will be institutionalized as an annual event for book
exchanges between Taiwan and the world community.</P>
      <P>The TIBE, the sixth of its kind since 1988, boasts of being the
fourth largest book fair in the world. It will feature books offered
by 673 publishers from 40 countries and areas around the world
displayed in 1,409 booths at the Taipei World Trade Center.</P>
      <P>In an unprecedented attraction, a German theme pavilion at this
year's TIBE is presenting a glimpse of the Frankfurt Book Fair, the
world's biggest such exhibition with a 250-year tradition.</P>
      <P>On display at the pavilion will be an array of 1,500 German
publications, a collection of original illustrated books by 15 German
artists, an authentic 15th-century Gutenberg press -- believed to be
the world's first movable-type machine, and a collection of some of
the smallest books in existence -- prayer books in seven languages.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SRAM DUMPING CHARGES TAKE DRAMATIC TURN (PART I)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Feb.  18  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Dumping charges against Taiwan and
South Korean manufacturers involving static random access memory
(SRAM) chips took a dramatic turn during Wednesday's final public
hearing at the US International Trade Commission (ITC), with the
largest American SRAM maker Motorola Corp. voicing opposition to
imposing punitive anti-dumping tariffs on Taiwan and Korean
exporters.</P>
      <P>Motorola, which produces US$520 million worth of SRAMs annually,
said at the ITC public hearing that since the final verdict delivered
by the Commerce of Department (DOC) last week exempted South Korea's
Samsung Co. from punitive tariffs, the anti-dumping charges filed by
Micron Co. have become meaningless.</P>
      <P>Motorola claimed that Samsung is the strongest foreign competitor
that has caused "real harm" to American SRAM makers, while other
Korean and Taiwan makers to be subject to the DOC-proposed punitive
anti-dumping tariffs do not pose a real threat because their combined
American market share falls below 10 percent.</P>
      <P>Motorola asked the ITC to reconsider the DOC verdict, which it
said would only serve to make Samsung the real beneficiary. "Samsung
would become even more competitive in the US market once other Korean
and Taiwan SRAM makers are subject to punitive tariff rates," it
asserted.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, Micron lawyers, however, said that
Taiwan makers took the lead in selling their SRAMs below fair market
prices and that Samsung was forced to follow suit.</P>
      <P>Even though the aggregate market share controlled by Taiwan and
other Korean makers is limited, Micron said, their "low price"
strategy would eventually force their American counterparts to cut
prices or completely withdraw from the market. "So they should be
subject to punitive tariffs," a Micron lawyer asserted.</P>
      <P>According to market tallies, Samsung accounts for 13 percent of
the US SRAM import market; Taiwan makers, including Windbond,
Microelectronics, Alliance and Integrated Silicon Solution (Taiwan)
Inc. (ISSI), jointly control a 5 percent market share; and other
Korean firms on the dumping list, including Hyundai and Lucky-Gold
Star Group, jointly command a 3 percent share.</P>
      <P>Lawyers representing Korean makers stressed that their SRAM
exports would not cause any harm to American firms because the
quantity is limited. Moreover, they said, their products are
different from Taiwan's. Taiwan mainly produces high-speed SRAMs.</P>
      <P>Lawyers hired by Taiwan companies said two of the charged Taiwan
firms -- ISSI and Alliance -- are owned by Americans and that the
remaining Taiwan firms actually account for less than 3 percent of
the US SRAM import market.</P>
      <P>For all these arguments, observers said the chances that the ITC
would overrule the DOC's dumping charges against Taiwan and Korean
makers are slim.</P>
      <P>Genda Hu, secretary-general of the Taiwan Semiconductor Industry
Association who came to Washington on Monday to appeal for Taiwan
firms, said there is a 50-50 probability that the ITC will make a
decision favorable to Taiwan makers.</P>
      <P>Under US anti-dumping procedures, both the plaintiffs and
defendants can still furnish the ITC with relevant data or documents
before Feb. 26 and present written responses or arguments based new
data offered by the rival side before March 23. The ITC is expected
to deliver a final adjudication on the DOC's anti-dumping verdict by
the end of March. If the ITC upholds the verdict, Taiwan SRAM makers
will be subject to punitive anti-dumping tariff rates starting in
early April.</P>
      <P>According to the DOC final verdict, Windbond-produced SRAM chips
will be subject to a punitive tariff rate of 102.83 percent; the rate
for United Microelectronics reaches 93.87 percent; the rates for
Alliance and ISSI are set at 50.58 percent and 7.59 percent,
respectively.</P>
      <P>The three Taiwan companies which failed to respond to
questionnaires sent by the DOC -- Texas-Acer Instruments, Best
Integrated Technology and Advanced Microelectronics -- will be
subject to an extremely high rate of 113.85 percent. And the rate for
all other Taiwan SRAM makers is set at 41.98 percent.

    <TEXT>
      <P>Industry sources said even if the ITC upholds the verdict, it may
not critically hurt Taiwan firms because SRAMs built in motherboards,
which form the bulk of Taiwan's SRAM exports to the US market, won't
be subject to punitive rates.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Taiwan makers worry that Micron may file dumping
charges against their dynamic random access memory (DRAM) chips
following its victory in the SRAM case. DRAM chips account for the
lion's share of export items of many Taiwan semiconductor
manufacturers.</P>
      <P>Micron spokesperson Julie Nash, however, told CNA that Micron has
no plans to file such a charge because Taiwan makers command only a
modest 5 percent share of the US DRAM import market. "The prospects
for us to win such a case are slim," she noted.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN CHEMICAL INDUSTRY TO MAKE INROADS INTO NORTHEAST ASIA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 19 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>In an effort to open markets in neighboring
Japan and South Korea, a delegation from Taiwan's chemical sector is
planning an April trip to Seoul, Tokyo and Osaka, the China External
Trade Development Council (CETRA) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for CETRA, a nonprofit organization funded by the
government to promote market expansion, said the Northeast Asian
visit will present excellent opportunities to increase trade and
develop cooperative relations there.</P>
      <P>CETRA suggested that the capital investment and technology fields
in Japan and Korea are well suited for launching strategic
cooperation, while forging mutual licensing agreements with local
companies there is also a good way to penetrate regional markets and
at the same time to acquire new technologies, the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>He added that the present time is the best juncture for local
chemical businesses to develop the Korean market, as that country is
facing a period of supply and demand readjustment after entering the
"IMF era" -- a reference to attempts by the International Monetary
Fund to guide Korea's torn economy out of financial chaos.</P>
      <P>According to CETRA, a sponsor of the April visit, the delegation
will be composed of representatives from the member-enterprises of
industry associations for dyestuffs, synthetic resin and plastic raw
materials, as well as executives of the Taipei Import-Export
Association.</P>
      <P>The CETRA official indicated that in addition to the two
Northeast Asian countries, his council has also mapped out programs
for making inroads into Southeast Asia's chemical industry markets,
and for exploring opportunities in those sectors in India and
southern Europe.

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN MALES TO BE ALLOWED TO GO OVERSEAS FOR TOURISM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  19  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan males who have yet to serve their
military conscription duty will be allowed to go overseas for
tourism, if a plan by the Ministry of the Interior (MOI) goes
through.</P>
      <P>The plan will benefit mainly those who are enrolled in schools
and have yet to serve in the armed forces as well as those who quit
school and are awaiting their conscription notifications.</P>
      <P>Under current regulations, Taiwan males who reach the age of 19
must serve in the military if they are no longer pursuing academic
studies. Furthermore, until they have fulfilled their obligation of
military service, they are barred from going overseas.</P>
      <P>Those who have yet to fulfill their mandatory military duty must
apply for permission if they wish to travel abroad, with such
applications reviewed on a case-by-case basis.</P>
      <P>But the Council of Grand Justices late last year said in its
interpretation of the ROC Constitution that the practice runs counter
to the spirit of the Constitution, which guarantees the people
freedom of movement.</P>
      <P>The officials said that in response to the decision, the MOI will
revise its regulations to allow those males who have yet to serve in
the military to go overseas for tourism. However, it will continue to
prohibit them from going overseas to study, except for short-term
courses.</P>
      <P>Taiwan males affected by the proposed regulations will thus be
able to travel overseas by June 25 at the latest if the revisions are
adopted, they said.</P>
      <P>Interior Minister Huang Chu-wen said the MOI is obligated to give
priority to the rights of people who wish to go overseas for tourism,
rather than attempting to prevent the male from going aboard for
fear of they may be dodging military service.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a spokesman for the Ministry of Defense said it will
have to confer with the MOI before making any comment on the proposed
regulations.</P>
      <P>The ministries of defense, education and the interior are due to
meet next week to discuss related issues.</P>

(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The United States has warned that
Australia's alleged use of quarantine issues as protection barriers
could harm its push for bigger export to America and elsewhere.</P>
      <P>The warning was made by US Ambassador to Australia Genta Hawkins
Holmes, who said other important trading partners such as Canada, New
Zealand, Thailand and the European Union have supported the US view.</P>
      <P>The US envoy's remarks about Australia's quarantine decisions
echo criticisms in January by the Canadian high commissioner and
follow quarantine decisions to ban imports of fresh salmon and cooked
chicken meat for most purposes.</P>
      <P>"Too often ... Australia seems to be using technical restrictions
in order to provide protection for inefficient sections of
agriculture," she said.</P>
      <P>"Concern about this and the possible negative effects on
Australian exports have been expressed by many in this room. We
remain very concerned over the potential to move backwards on access
requests that have been around for as long as 10 years or more, such
as table grapes, Florida citrus, and should I mention salmon and
chicken?" she added.</P>
      <P>Earlier Australia's Prime Minister John Howard blasted Washington
for using its export guarantee funding to help American farmers
provide necessary credit to cash-strapped Asian countries such as
South Korea and Indonesia for imports of US commodities because the
Asian countries are facing economic crises and are short of funds to
import agricultural produce.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 19 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) is
studying proposed revisions to relevant statutes in order to allow
foreign investment in state-owned enterprises during the process of
privatization.</P>
      <P>Under a program to sell shares of leading state-run enterprises,
including Chinese Petroleum Corp. (CPC), Taiwan Power Co. (Taipower),
Chunghwa Telecom, and Aerospace Industrial Development Corp. (AIDC),
ownership of those companies will be gradually transferred to private
investors, MOEA officials said.</P>
      <P>For example, they said, CPC, one of the oldest and most lucrative
state-run enterprises in Taiwan, will be privatized in three stages,
with the first stage having already begun.</P>
      <P>Some 10 percent to 15 percent of CPC stakes will be sold to
private investors and CPC employees in the first stage, scheduled to
conclude in fiscal year 1998.</P>
      <P>Another 15 percent to 20 percent of the CPC shares, set to be
released in fiscal 1999, will be opened to foreign strategic
investors through the Taiwan Stock Exchange and to other overseas
investors in the form of global depository receipts (GDR).</P>
      <P>In the final stage, scheduled to be launched before the end of
1999, 25 percent to 30 percent of CPC stakes will be released to
eligible ROC citizens, the officials noted.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the privatization of Taipower will also be implemented
in three stages, starting in early 1999.</P>
      <P>In the first stage, 10 percent of Taipower stakes, or about 3
billion shares, will be sold to private investors through public
bidding and offered to Taipower employees. The process is expected to
be implemented before June 1999.</P>
      <P>Another 10 percent of the Taipower shares, set to be released
before June 2000, will be opened to local strategic investors through
the Taiwan Stock Exchange and to overseas investors in the form of
GDRs.</P>
      <P>In the third stage, scheduled to be launched before June 2001, 20
percent to 30 percent of Taipower stakes will be released to eligible
ROC citizens, the officials said.</P>
      <P>There will be flexibility in proceeding with the second and third
stages, depending on the market reaction, they noted.</P>
      <P>If the Taipower shares prove to be highly sought after in the
initial offer, the third phase selloff may be moved up to June 2000,
with the original second phase being pushed back to June 2001, the
officials added.</P>
      <P>In addition, they said, special annual reward rates will be
offered as incentives for long-term investors who hold the Taipower
shares for at least two years.</P>
      <P>AIDC, formerly the military-run Aero-Industry Development Center,
which built Taiwan's locally designed Indigenous Defense Fighters, is
scheduled to go private in two stages between June this year and
December 1999, the officials said.</P>

      <P>Tensions across the Taiwan Strait are on the
rise, according to a report published on Thursday by the Defense
Institute of the Japan Defense Agency, which has made a study on the
strategic environment of countries around Japan.</P>
      <P>The report titled "A Strategic Overview of East Asia, 1997-1998"
pointed out that crisis management involving the Taiwan Strait is
becoming more difficult.</P>
      <P>Compared with the report published last year, which did not rule
out the possibility of mainland China launching a "peace offensive"
toward Taiwan, the outlook for 1998 is gloomier, pointing out that
"mainland China does not expect (ROC President) Lee Teng-hui's
administration to be a force for improving cross-strait relations."</P>
      <P>The buildup of the air forces on both sides and Taiwan's

(By Wu Shean-shen and Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Hong Kong's current change shortage is
due to coin collectors and ordinary Hong Kong citizens, who have put
aside almost all of Hong Kong's commemorative coins minted in 1997
and those bearing the portrait of the British queen, said an official
with the government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.</P>
      <P>When questioned at the Provisional Legislative Council about the
coin shortage in the market, Xu Shiren, head of the trade and
economic affairs bureau of the Hong Kong government, pointed out that
the government issued 800 million new coins in 1997 to replace the
800 million coins with the bust of Queen Elizabeth II it expected
would be put aside by Hong Kong residents and collectors.</P>
      <P>Worry over the coin shortage, however, has caused people to hoard
coins even more, further worsening the situation, he said.</P>
      <P>Xu offered three approaches to resolve the problem: the
continuous minting of new coins, accelerating the circulation of
coins in the market and expanding the use of electronically read
cards in public transportation.</P>
      <P>The Hong Kong government issued 206 million coins in the first
six weeks of this year, with that figure expected to reach 1.4
billion coins by the end of September, or some 156 million additional
coins per month.</P>
      <P>The Hong Kong government is encouraging bus companies to adopt
the use of transportation cards. A total of 3.8 million such cards
have been sold to date.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN MAKES MAJOR CONCESSION ON RICE TRADE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Feb.  18  (CNA)
(By Herman Pan and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China on Taiwan has
agreed to a major concession on the opening of its rice market in
exchange for US support of its entry into the World Trade
Organization (WTO).</P>
      <P>ROC Minister of Economic Affairs Wang Chih-kang said here on
Wednesday that Taiwan has promised to follow the Japanese formula in
opening its rice market after its WTO accession as demanded by the US
side.</P>
      <P>This means that if Taiwan enters the Geneva-based world trade
regulatory body this year, it must immediately open its rice market,
with an import quota equivalent to 6.4 percent of its total rice
consumption between 1990 and 1992. And if its entry is postponed to
next year, the import quota will increase to 7.2 percent of its
1990-92 rice consumption.</P>
      <P>Taiwan originally offered an import quota of 4 percent of its
1990-92 rice consumption, with the quota increasing by 0.8 percent
annually to 8 percent in five years.</P>
      <P>According to the new terms, Taiwan will be required to allow
annual imports of about 96,000 tons of rice if it joins the WTO in
1999, far higher than the previously proposed 60,000 tons.</P>
      <P>Wang said he hopes Taiwan's concession in rice trade will help
finalize the WTO-related bilateral talks with the United States soon.</P>
      <P>Wang said the two sides have agreed to extend the current round
of WTO talks for one day to Thursday in order to seek breakthroughs
on some unsolved thorny issues.</P>
      <P>Wang met with US Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky on
Wednesday afternoon to discuss policy issues. During their talks,
Wang urged the US side to be more flexible in dealing with topics
related to pork and animal intestine trade so that bilateral WTO
talks can be concluded at an early date.</P>
      <P>For her part, Barshefsky expressed the US hopes that Taiwan
complies with an EVSL market liberalization plan proposed by the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum and supports the
Clinton administration's proposals for zero-tariff electronics
trade.</P>
      <P>Barshefsky also expressed concern about America's widening
trade deficit with Taiwan. According to US tallies, the US incurred a
trade deficit of more than US$12 billion with Taiwan in 1997, the
highest in eight years. However, ROC tallies put Taiwan's trade
surplus with the US at only US$6.3 billion.</P>
      <P>Wang arrived in Washington on Sunday for high-level
consultations with senior US officials on terms for Taiwan's WTO
entry.</P>
      <P>Wang said it remains uncertain whether the two sides can
finalize all WTO-related issues on Thursday. If no compromise on
several sensitive issues can be worked out, he said, the two sides
will hold another round of talks in the future.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has so far held 17 rounds of WTO talks with the US. The
current round began last week and the two sides have managed to come
to terms on several topics, including the opening of Taiwan's
chicken meat market and service markets, timetables for farm trade
tariff reductions and issues related to wine and tobacco imports.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Canadians, battling the spread of hepatitis
resulting from a tainted-blood scandal, are wary of claims Wednesday
that scientists in the United States and Hungary have found a cure
for the B and C types of the disease.</P>
      <P>The US and Hungarian researchers said they had found a naturally
occurring virus that wipes out the disease. They also said the cure
has no side effects and costs just a fraction of what is currently
spent. The Hepatitis C Society of Canada said the claims seem
exaggerated.</P>
      <P>Tim McClemont, executive director of the society, said it would
ask Health Canada's Health Protection Branch to check the
researchers' claims.</P>
      <P>McClemont said while the news is encouraging, experts are
entitled to be skeptical about claims of an outright cure because
progress in treatment has been slow.</P>
      <P>The number of Hepatitis B cases has been reduced through
vaccination programs, but Hepatitis C is now recognized as a major
public health problem worldwide.</P>
      <P>In Canada, the number of cases is estimated at 300,000 or 1
percent of the population. That includes the thousands who were
infected by tainted blood products in the 1980s and are now demanding
government compensation.</P>
      <P>The blood-borne disease show such symptoms as chronic fatigue,
nausea and vomiting and jaundice. Both strains attack the liver and
can lead to liver cancer or cirrhosis.</P>
      <P>Results of tests using a naturally occurring virus developed by
Laszlo Csatary of the United Cancer Research Institute in Alexandria,
Va., are to be published in the March edition of the international
journal Anticancer Research.</P>

Toulouse, France, that blamed the crash on bad weather and human
error, the CAA official expressed his disagreement, noting that both
before and after the crash there were many successful landings and
take-offs, which he said shows the weather was not responsible.</P>
      <P>"It's improper for Airbus to make such statements before all the
evidence is in," Chang said.</P>
      <P>In order to gain in-depth knowledge of the likely condition of
the plane before the accident, the CAA has asked relevant departments
and CAL to provide numbered, detailed information on the aircraft's
parts and components, as well as its repair records.</P>
      <P>Precise weather data recorded by advanced Doppler radar were also
acquired to check whether wind shear or sudden air currents appeared
when the A-300 plane was preparing for landing, said Chang, who added
that his team is also investigating allegations that CAL falsified
its pilots' flight-hour records.</P>

      <P>The annual production value of Taiwan's

in five years, according to a white paper on telecommunications
policy unveiled on Thursday.</P>
      <P>In releasing the white paper, officials with the Directorate
General of Telecommunications under the Ministry of Transportation
and Communications said that since the opening of four
telecommunications services between January and May 1996 to private
telecommunications operators, there have been abundant business
opportunities in that sector.</P>
      <P>The officials said that the annual production value of the four
services -- covering mobile telephones, radio paging, mobile data

    <HEADLINE>S'PORE MAY BE FIRST IN ASIA TO JOIN US FIGHTER PROJECT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  Feb. 19 (CNA)
(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Singapore is poised to become the first
Asian country to join the United States in a program to develop the
next generation of multi-role strike fighter aircraft.</P>
      <P>A memorandum of understanding is under discussion that could pave
the way for Singapore's Ministry of Defense to join the Joint Strike
Fighter (JSF) program as an "informed customer," The Straits Times
reported Thursday, quoting the weekly aerospace news magazine Flight
International.</P>
      <P>The arrangement is another indication of the close relationship
between the governments of the two countries and the good defense
ties they have been cultivating, the report said.</P>
      <P>The JSF program is aimed at developing and fielding an affordable
family of next-generation multi-role strike fighter aircraft for the
US Navy, Air Force (USAF), Marine Corps and its allies, the magazine
said.</P>
      <P>As an informed customer, the Republic of Singapore Air Force
(RSAF) would be given access to 90 percent of the data on the
program. This would allow it to evaluate the JSF against future
requirements, it said.</P>
      <P>However, Singapore's observer status would not give it key
information on radar-evading stealth technology or allow it to
influence the fighter's design, according to the magazine.</P>
      <P>Denmark, the Netherlands and Norway have already become informed
customers of the JSF program. Italy is holding talks on joining the
program, and Australia has been briefed on it.</P>
      <P>Commenting on getting involved in the JSF program, the Feb. 18-24
issue of Flight International quoted Lt. Gen. Bey Soo Khiang,
Singapore's defense chief, as saying:</P>
      <P>"I think that we would be interested in doing that, but the
entrance fee is still quite big to us ... so it is something to
ponder on.</P>
      <P>"From an operational viewpoint, with the JSF being a possible
replacement for the F-16s in the long-term, it is something we should
be interested in."</P>
      <P>No details on the cost were available, the report said.</P>
      <P>Lockheed F-16s are among the fighters the RSAF operates.</P>
      <P>The JSF project is already partially through a 51-month concept
demonstration phase that will culminate in the final selection by
early 2001 of a winning design, the report said.</P>
      <P>Boeing and Lockheed Martin were short-listed in November 1996 for
each to produce two demonstrators.</P>
      <P>The US and Singapore governments enjoy a close relationship, and
many of Singapore's defense purchases are US-made products.</P>
      <P>The USAF has made available its bases in the United States for
training of RSAF F-16 pilots, giving them the needed air-space
Singapore lacks.</P>
      <P>The USAF rotates F-16 deployments through Singapore, and recently
Singapore announced that US Navy carriers would be given access to
its new Changi Naval Base.</P>
      <P>The involvement in the JSF program is another indication of the
close ties the two countries have been building. There is also
prestige involved in being part of the program, the report said.</P>
      <P>Flight International said that the JSF admission "would elevate
the status of Singapore head and shoulders above that of its
Southeast Asian neighbors."</P>

    <HEADLINE>1ST SQUADRON OF 2ND IDF WING FORMED AT TAINAN AIRBASE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  19  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The first squadron of the second wing of
the locally built indigenous defense fighters (IDFs) was formed at an
air force base in Tainan, southern Taiwan on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Air Force Commander-in-Chief Gen. Huang Hsien-yung presided over
a ceremony marking the formation of the new squadron.</P>
      <P>Huang said he is delighted to see that the Tainan airbase has
completed installation and initial personnel training of the squadron
in just 11 months, indicating that the system for aircraft
replacement and personnel training established by the air force is
sound.</P>
      <P>Huang reviewed all 18 of the IDFs, also known as Ching-kuo
fighters in memory of late President Chiang Ching-kuo, their pilots
and maintenance personnel, and presented citations to those who
contributed to the installation and training work.</P>
      <P>At the moment, the squadron has only preliminary combat
capability and will require further professional training before it
can be formally commissioned, Huang said, adding that he hopes the
airbase staff will continue working hand-in-hand to complete all
necessary training programs as scheduled.</P>
      <P>The first IDF wing, comprising 70 IDFs, was commissioned last
April at the Ching Chuan Kang airbase in central Taiwan. The second
wing, which will consist of 60 IDFs in three squadrons, is scheduled
to be formally commissioned at the Tainan airbase in 1999.</P>
      <P>The air force had originally planned to purchase 150 of the
locally developed IDFs, but cut the number to 130 after striking
separate deals with the United States and France for purchasing 150
F-16 and 60 Mirage 2000-5 jet fighters, respectively.</P>
      <P>The three types of advanced fighters will form the backbone of
Taiwan's fleet of second-generation warplanes.</P>

    <HEADLINE>VP LIEN TALKS ABOUT ISSUE OF TAIWAN STRAIT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  19 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Lien Chan of the Republic
of China said here Thursday that the issue of Taiwan Strait can be
resolved through friendly exchanges between Taiwan and mainland
China.</P>
      <P>He made the remark at an international conference on the People's
Republic of China after the 15th Party Congress, which opened in
Beijing on Sept. 12, 1997.</P>
      <P>He said Taiwan and mainland China will eventually be able to
reach their common goal of national unification under the principles
of freedom, democracy, and equal distribution of wealth, if the two
sides can sit down to resume their talks without setting
preconditions and excluding any particular issues.</P>
      <P>Lien said he recently set forth "three nos and three yeses" as
an applicable approach to the Taiwan Strait issue. The three nos are
no Taiwan independence, no hurry to unify with the Chinese mainland,
and no antagonism.</P>
      <P>He explained that the Republic of China has been a sovereign
state for 87 years. "We do not need to once again declare
independence or change the name of our nation." He said Taiwan is in
no hurry to unite with the Chinese mainland, because conditions for
unification are not yet ripe. He also said that the two sides should
not provoke or exclude each other. They should not deliberately
incite antagonism or hostility and thereby cause instability.</P>
      <P>The "three yeses" Lien proposed are yes to peace, yes to
friendly exchanges, and yes to a "win-win" situation for both
sides.</P>
      <P>The three yeses and one "no to antagonism" will provide the best
condition for promoting friendly exchanges and moving toward eventual
reunification, he said.</P>
      <P>Continuous exchanges would enhance mutual understanding and
reduce hostilities, and thus prevent conflicts between the two sides.
"Indeed, proceeding with gradual and sequential exchanges between the
two sides is the ideal method for maintaining peace in the Taiwan
Strait," he said.</P>
      <P>Through dialogue and exchanges in the past ten years, the two
sides have laid a foundation for bilateral relations. From 1991 to
October 1997, Taiwan entrepreneurs invested a total of US$8.17
billion in mainland China. Since 1990, an average of one million
visits by Taiwan residents to the mainland have been made per year,
he pointed out.</P>
      <P>However, he said that a latent antagonistic atmosphere still
lingers, "which we are very concerned about."</P>
      <P>Lien said Beijing, which wants to wipe the Republic of China off
the face of the earth, is now hoping to annex Taiwan "in name."
Beijing's efforts to suppress Taiwan's foreign relations will only
intensify the ill will the residents of Taiwan feel for the Chinese
communist regime. "This is clearly detrimental to the development of
cross-strait relations and national reunification," he added.</P>
      <P>The Vice President said the two sides must respect each other's
international presence, cooperate, and help each other. "We must
march hand in hand toward a new era of cooperation," he said, adding
that "I believe exchanges to be the most effective and feasible
method for resolving the Taiwan Strait issue."</P>
      <P>He said the differences between Taiwan and mainland China are
often called "Taiwan issues," but it is better to call them "Taiwan
Strait issues," because the latter can better indicate the complexity
of all factors involved.</P>

    <DATELINE>Geneva,  Feb.  19  (CNA)
(By Maurus Young)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The European Union is urging Beijing to
allow foreign companies to operate nationwide and to offer a full
range of services there as part of communist China's bid to join the
World Trade Organization (WTO), according to reports from the
Geneva-based world trade regulatory body on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Mainland China's current WTO offer obliges most foreign companies
offering services to set up only through joint venture agreements.
Foreign companies should be able to operate nationwide, but Beijing's
current offer limits the areas where foreign companies can operate.</P>
      <P>Key services such as telecommunications, transport, financial
services and distribution should be available in a mature economy,
but mainland China has made no offer on basic telecommunications, the
WTO report said.</P>
      <P>An EU team led by Trade Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan went
recently to mainland China, where it presented Beijing with a list of
eight principles that it should follow in its offer to the WTO on
market access for the services sector and a memorandum setting out
these eight principles was released by the European Commission in
Brussels.</P>
      <P>The memorandum said foreign companies should be allowed to choose
whether or not to set up branches, subsidiaries, wholly-owned
companies, or joint ventures.</P>
      <P>It also called for transparency in mainland China laws and
regulations and for a sound and neutral regulatory regime. It also
urged mainland China to review its laws on the establishment of
foreign companies, pointing out that many restrictive conditions
apply to foreign firms, but not to domestic ones.</P>
      <P>Brittan announced in Beijing that mainland China has promised to
submit detailed tariff cuts to the WTO in Geneva next month, the WTO
report added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SPECIAL FUND ESTABLSIHED TO HELP CONVICTED MURDERER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  19  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A special fund was founded in Taipei on
Thursday to help Tzuo Ming-hsin, a Republic of China national who was
convicted of first-degree murder in the US state of Alaska seven
years ago and is now serving a 198-year prison term there.</P>
      <P>Tzuo Tzu-cheng, son of the convicted murderer, announced the
establishment of the fund at a news conference held at the
Legislative Yuan in the company of former Justice Minister Ma
Ying-jeou, Legislator Chien Hsi-kun (DPP-ex officio) and Lin
Shen-fen, a senior journalist.</P>
      <P>Ma, now a professor at National Chengchi University (NCU), called
on local people to donate money to the fund in order to hire
qualified lawyers to appeal for a retrial of Tzuo's case. The fund's
postal savings account number is 19148901.</P>
      <P>Ma, a Harvard-trained legal expert, said seeking a retrial of
the Tzuo case requires professional legal expertise and a large sum
of money. "We hope local people will pool resources to support
Tzuo's cause," he added.</P>
      <P>Ma said the fund will also help other ROC nationals or overseas
Chinese who have faced unfair trials abroad.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, Tzuo Tzu-cheng, an NCU student,
said he appreciates all those who have assisted him in setting up
the fund. "I'll carefully record all donations and repay donors
after I graduate from the university and start to work."</P>
      <P>Tzu-cheng paid a visit to his father at an Alaska prison
during the Chinese New Year holiday. He held a news conference
there to enlist support for his father's cause.</P>
      <P>Tzuo left Taiwan for Alaska in the 1980s to work as a cook. He
was arrested on charges of murdering a Chinese man and the man's
daughter in 1989. A jury found him guilty in 1991 of first-degree
murder and sentenced him to 198 years in prison.</P>
      <P>Tzuo was convicted simply on the basis of a tape recording,
without having physical evidence such as the murder weapon,
fingerprint samples or blood stains. Moreover, he never had an
opportunity to testify for himself. Tzuo has gone on a
long-term hunger strike to protest his conviction. He has
consistently insisted on his innocence over the past seven years.</P>
      <P>Several American lawyers who were present at the news conference
given by Tzu-cheng in the US earlier this month said there were many
faults in investigation and trial of Tzuo's case. Some of them have
promised to help Tzuo get another chance at justice.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it has ordered its
officials stationed in the US to seek assistance of American legal
experts or advisory groups to help Tzuo's cause. "We'll also ask US
authorities to ensure that Tzuo is given reasonable, humanitarian
treatment in jail," said a minsitry official.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BAYER TO MAKE HUMANITARIAN PAYMENTS TO HEMOPHILIAC AIDS VICTIMS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 19 (CNA)
(By Lin Wen-fen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Germany's Bayer Group on Thursday agreed to
provide humanitarian payments to ROC hemophilia patients infected
with HIV from tainted blood products produced by the chemical giant,
according to a statement issued by Bayer Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The statement said that Bayer, together with Baxter Laboratories,
another manufacturer of tainted coagulants derived from blood plasma,
will set aside NT$106 million in the form of a bank guarantee to help
the 53 local hemophilia patients who contracted HIV from injections
of contaminated coagulants. The two manufacturers will negotiate
directly with the patients or their representatives to reach
agreement on the amount of each payment.</P>
      <P>It said that a representative from Bayer headquarters will arrive
in Taiwan on Monday to commence the negotiations.</P>
      <P>However, the statement stressed that the company does not share
responsibility for HIV infections caused by blood plasma products
distributed in the early 1980s, on the grounds that the tragedy was
"unforeseeable and unavoidable" at that time. The Bayer subsidiary,
Cutter Laboratories in the US, has always manufactured strictly in
accordance with the latest scientific knowledge, it claimed.</P>
      <P>As Bayer is in full agreement that the patients and their
families are in need of financial support, the company is willing to
provide them with humanitarian payments, the statement said.</P>
      <P>Bayer's statement is a positive response to a call made by the
Department of Health (DOH) last week, when DOH Director-General Chan
Chi-hsien demanded that Bayer offer a NT$2 million guarantee to each
of the 53 hemophilia patients as a way of showing a sincere desire to
solve the dispute.</P>
      <P>Between 1983 and 1985, 53 hemophilia patients in the ROC
contracted the AIDS virus from injections of contaminated coagulants
made by Cutter Laboratories and Baxter Laboratories. Twenty-two of
the original patients have already died of the deadly disease.</P>
      <P>The representatives of the patients in recent years have been
asking the DOH to assist them in seeking compensation from the
foreign suppliers of the tainted products. In addition, they have
filed suit against the DOH to demand "national compensation" -- NT$8
million each -- as they believe the DOH should shoulder the blame for
failing to ensure the safety of the imported blood products.</P>
      <P>Due to limited knowledge about the AIDS virus in the early 1980s,
the government didn't demand that all coagulants be heat-treated --
an effective method of eliminating the potential AIDS virus -- until
1985.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MINISTER VOWS TO SHOULDER POLITICAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR CAL AIR CRASH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  19 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Tsay Jaw-yang, minister of transportation
and communications, promised on Thursday to shoulder political
responsibility for the tragic crash of China Airlines (CAL) flight
676, one day after he boasted about his ministry's "good" performance
during the rescue operation.</P>
      <P>Tsay told a group of ruling Kuomintang (KMT) leaders at an inner
party meeting that the administration, especially the Ministry of
Transportation and Communications (MOTC) will definitely assume
political responsibility for the crash which claimed the lives of 202
people on Monday.</P>
      <P>He refused to elaborate on how he will take responsibility,
saying that Premier Vincent Siew has ordered him to "explain his
plans in detail" to the Legislature on Friday.</P>
      <P>Tsay's statement came one day after public outrage over his boast
on Wednesday about the ministry's performance in handling events
following the crash, which, he claimed, was "no less than the
performance of the Japanese authorities" in their efficient and
well-organized management of the 1993 CAL air crash in Nagoya which
killed 264.</P>
      <P>He shrugged off reporters' inquiries about the possibility of his
resigning when he emerged from a meeting of the KMT Central Standing
Committee on Wednesday , saying that the KMT Chairman Lee Teng-hui,
who also serves as the country's president, was rather positive about
his performance in the crisis and that he has no intention whatsoever
of quitting because of the tragedy,</P>
      <P>Tsay's claims drew fire from opposition lawmakers as well as from
families of the victims. They criticized Tsay's "arrogance" and the
government's alleged laxness in enforcing aviation safety rules which
they said contributed to the disaster.</P>
      <P>Admitting that the public view of his ministry's job performance
differs widely to his own, Tsay said on Thursday that his praise on
Wednesday for the rescue operation referred only to the 1,500-strong
rescue crew, and admitted that there are certainly some shortcomings
which need to be improved in the MOTC's crisis management.</P>
      <P>At a Cabinet meeting earlier on Thursday, Siew criticized
government agencies' amateurism in dealing with the rescue, and the
less-than-thoughtful way the search, identification and release of
the victims' bodies was carried out.</P>
      <P>Fighting back tears, Siew said his personal sorrow for the
tragedy could not be relieved by weeping. Noting that 774 lives in
Taiwan have been lost in 20 air crashes in the last two decades, the
premier called on his Cabinet members to do their utmost to ensure
aviation safety and prevent a repeat of the tragedy.</P>
      <P>Siew's criticism stemmed partly from complaints by some of the
victim's families on Wednesday that prosecutors had refused to
release the bodies of their beloved pending DNA confirmation of their
identities.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors eventually backed down and agreed to let the
families claim the bodies after the families promised not to cremate
the victims before the test results are released.</P>

      <P>Pilot C. C. Miao was sentenced to three years, and co-pilot C. Y.
Chang received one year in prison on charges of involuntary
manslaughter.</P>
      <P>The earlier sentences, delivered in April 1977, saw Miao
receiving a two-and-a-half year jail term, while Chang was given a
sentence of eight months suspended for three years by the Kinmen
District Court.</P>
      <P>Judge Y.S. Shen, who announced the second verdicts, said Miao and
Chang were given heavier punishment because police investigations
proved that the two had displayed serious negligence in their duties.</P>
      <P>According to the judge, Miao, the senior officer on board, made a
serious mistake immediately following the crash by failing to try to
rescue any of the passengers of the ill-fated plane, opting instead
to save his own life. In accordance with ROC law, Miao and Chang can
appeal to the supreme court within 10 days of receiving the verdict,
he added.</P>
      <P>The Formosa Airlines Dornier 228 plane crashed into the sea on
April 5, 1996 while attempting to land on the offshore island of
Matsu near the coast of mainland China's Fujien Province. The
accident killed five people and injured seven more. A six-year-old

    <HEADLINE>LIBERIA SEES NO CONFLICT BETWEEN ENGAGEMENT WITH TAIPEI AND BEIJING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Monrovia,  Feb.  19  (CNA)
(By L.J. Yen &amp; Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Although sticking to the Republic of
China's "one China" policy, Liberia doesn't think its diplomatic ties
with Taiwan should exclude it from seeking friendship with Beijing,
Liberian President Charles Taylor said on Thursday.</P>
      <P>In an interview with a group of Taiwan reporters accompanying ROC
Foreign Minister Jason Hu on a one-day visit to the West African
country, Taylor said his country is committed to Taiwan's "one China
policy," but this policy doesn't preclude the country's possible
engagement with Beijing.</P>
      <P>"If Beijing asks to open an embassy here, we would grant it. We
would like to forge close ties with Beijing too," said Taylor, adding
that engagement with Taipei and Beijing should not conflict with each
other.</P>
      <P>Liberia has switched recognition between Taipei and Beijing
several times since 1957. The last switch occurred in 1997, when
Taylor assumed the presidency in August of that year and broke off
ties with Beijing.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile on Thursday, Hu signed a memorandum of understanding
with his Liberian counterpart Monie Captan on an aid package of US$3
million to help demobilize part of the country's 70,000-strong armed
forces now that a bitter four-year civil war in the impoverished
country has come to an end.</P>
      <P>Hu arrived in Monrovia on Wednesday morning on the fourth leg of
a six-country African trip. He called on Taylor later that day, when
he was awarded the Knight Grand Commander of The Human Order of
African Redonptm in honor of his contribution to improved mutual
ties.</P>
      <P>He left Monrovia on Thursday afternoon for the island nation of
Sao Tome and Principe off the coast of Central Africa.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING WILLING TO HOLD TALKS WITH DPP SHOULD DPP IN POWER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  19  (CNA)
(By Lin Wen-fen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Tang Shubei, vice chairman of mainland
China's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS),
said on Thursday that the mainland authorities are willing to hold
talks with the Republic of China's Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
once the opposition party takes up the reins of power, according to a
high-ranking DPP official who is currently visiting Beijing.</P>
      <P>Yin Wang-chin, director of the DPP's China Affairs Department and
a member of a delegation headed by Lee Ching-ping, deputy
secretary-general of ARATS counterpart, the Taipei-based Straits
Exchange Foundation (SEF), said that Tang made the remarks while
meeting with the delegation.</P>
      <P>Yin said that during the meeting, they exchanged views on issues
surrounding the name and form of future cross-strait talks. According
to Yin, his proposal that cross-strait talks could be conducted in
the name of a "cross-strait forum" was echoed by Tang.</P>
      <P>The "cross-strait forum," a model reached at Taiwan's National
Development Conference in December 1996, would provide an occasion
for representatives from the two sides of the Taiwan Strait to
exchange views on a comprehensive range of issues, without
preconceived stances on those issues. The representatives would
attend the forum in their private capacities.</P>
      <P>All the participants at the meeting agreed that before there can
be a resumption of cross-strait talks, unilaterally suspended by
mainland China in the summer of 1995, the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait should strengthen other channels of communication and
dialogue.</P>
      <P>When Tang said that cross-strait talks should be conducted under
the "one China" principle, Yin replied firmly that the DPP will not
accept this, stressing that the talks should be resumed under the
framework set by the "Koo-Wang" talks which took place in Singapore
in 1993.</P>
      <P>The delegation, composed of law scholars from the three major
parties in Taiwan -- the ruling Kuomintang, the DPP and the New
Party, arrived in Beijing on Monday for a week-long visit at the
invitation of the mainland's "National Taiwan Research Institute."</P>
      <P>The visit is being seen as an important step forward in enhancing
the mutual understanding of the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CONSTRUCTION ON 12-INCH WAFER PLANT TO KICK OFF IN 2ND QUARTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  20  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Construction on Taiwan's first 12-inch
silicon wafer plant will kick off in the second quarter of this year,
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) announced on Friday.</P>
      <P>The world's largest memory chip foundry service said it will
invest more than US$2 billion in building the new plant as part of
its effort to maintain market niches.</P>
      <P>TSMC Chairman Morris Chang said the plant, scheduled for
completion by the end of next year, will make Taiwan the world's
third country to have a 12-inch wafer production facility, after
Japan and the United States.</P>
      <P>According to Chang, TSMC has drawn an ambitious plan to build a
total of five 12-inch wafer plants by 2006. The world's first such
plant is expected to come on line either late this year or early next
year in Japan.</P>
      <P>"We'll continue to expand our production capacity and upgrade
technology," Chang said, adding that he is convinced that the company
will be able to catch up with industrial giants like Intel and IBM in
semiconductor production technology and capacity by the year 2000.</P>
      <P>Even though the global semiconductor market saw a slowdown last
year, Chang said his company still managed to post gains in chip
foundry services. TSMC earned NT$17.4 billion (US$527.27 million) on
a turnover of NT$43.9 billion in 1997, making it the best performing
local memory chip maker.</P>
      <P>To sustain its competitiveness, TSMC has invested heavily in
expanding production facilities in recent years. Its fourth and fifth
wafer plants in the Hsinchu Science-based Industrial Park became
operational last year and construction on its sixth wafer plant has
begun at the Tainan Science-based Industrial Park in southern Taiwan.
The company now can produce 1.19 million units of 8-inch wafers
annually.</P>
      <P>TSMC officials said the global demand for semiconductors will
continue to grow because of swift expansion of low-price computer
markets around the world. The OEM (original equipment manufacturing)
orders for specially designed integrated circuits (ICs) have also
been growing steadily, accounting for about 10 percent of the world's
total semiconductor production.</P>
      <P>TSMC forecast that the global IC foundry service market will
reach US$8 billion this year, with an annual growth rate of more than
23 percent.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENTIAL ENVOY LEAVES FOR VATICAN TO ATTEND ELEVATION CEREMONY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  20  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Huang Kun-huei, secretary-general to the
president of the Republic of China, left for the Vatican Thursday
evening to attend a ceremony on Saturday at the Holy See during which
Archbishop Paul K.H. Shan of Kaohsiung will be elevated to the post
of cardinal by Pope John Paul II.</P>
      <P>Huang took with him a personal letter from President Lee Teng-hui
to the pope, in which Lee sent greetings from the government and
people of the ROC to the world's highest Roman Catholic spiritual
leader.</P>
      <P>Prior to his departure, Huang said he attaches great importance
to his visit to Vatican City, the only state in Europe maintaining
diplomatic relations with the ROC. He said Shan's appointment by the
pope was seen by Taipei as indicative of the importance the Vatican
attaches to Taiwan's political democratization and religious freedom,
as well as to the long-lasting relations between the two sides.</P>
      <P>Nearly 20 heads of states and government leaders from around the
world will take part in the ceremony marking the elevation of 22 new
cardinals.</P>
      <P>Shan was appointed a cardinal by the Pope on Jan. 18, making him
the first clergyman in Taiwan to hold that title since the death of
Cardinal Yu Pin in 1978. Yu was raised to the cardinalship in Nanjing
on the Chinese mainland before the ROC government relocated its seat
to Taiwan in 1949.</P>
      <P>Shan, 74, who is still active in his work of promoting
catholicism, had requested retirement last year but was asked to stay
on by the Holy See. He said his appointment is an affirmation of all
300,000 Catholics and church workers in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In the Roman Catholic hierarchy, cardinals hold a status second
only to that of the pontiff. Collectively known as the College of
Cardinals, they are authorized to elect a new pope when the position
becomes vacant. However, several of those members have already passed
their 80th birthday, making them ineligible to participate in the
next papal election.</P>
      <P>With Shan's appointment, there will be three cardinals from the
world's Chinese communities, including Cardinal Hu Chen-chung in Hong
Kong and Cardinal Kung Ping-mei in mainland China. Kung, however,
will not be eligible to vote for a new pope in the event of John Paul
Pope II's death or resignation because he is over 80 years of age.</P>
      <P>The Vatican, as the spiritual center of the 1.1 billion Catholics
worldwide, exercises an enormous religious, ethical and moral
influence worldwide. Despite its small size, the Holy See maintains
formal diplomatic relations with more than 170 countries.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PAY FREEZE FOR SINGAPORE MINISTERS, TOP CIVIL SERVANTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  Feb.  20  (CNA)
(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Singapore Deputy Prime Minister Lee
Hsien Loong announced in Parliament on Thursday that salaries for
government ministers and top civil servants will be frozen this year,
to set the tone for the private sector in the wake of the Asian
regional financial crisis.</P>
      <P>"The tone should be restraint and caution. We must take the
crisis seriously, but in our stride," he said.</P>
      <P>In line with this, the government would freeze salaries for its
Staff 1 officers, who include ministers and top civil servants. This
means they would forgo an 8.1 percent rise that they would have been
paid starting on July 1 this year.</P>
      <P>Superscale G officers will face a 0.4 percent cut in pay, while
salaries for other grades will be adjusted accordingly.</P>
      <P>"In effect, salaries of all grades will be frozen or very
slightly reduced this year," Lee said.</P>
      <P>Promotions and normal increments will continue and if there is a
National Wages Council (NWC) adjustment later this year, it will
apply to all officers, including ministers, he said.</P>
      <P>The situation will be reviewed next year when the government has
the figures from the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) on
last year's earnings, he added.</P>
      <P>The deputy prime minister disclosed this in a speech in response
to a motion by Non-Constituency MP J.B. Jeyaretnam for ministers and
MPs to take a voluntary 25 percent pay cut to show that they identify
with those who have been hit by the regional financial crisis.</P>

      <P>Australian Prime Minister John Howard is
worried about possible civil strife and social disorder in Indonesia
and has warned President Suharto that Jakarta must strictly adhere to
the economic reforms demanded by the International Monetary Fund
(IMF).</P>
      <P>"The Indonesian economy is taking a fearful hammering and there
has been a huge reduction in the wealth of that country almost
overnight," Howard said.</P>
      <P>"I worry about the potential for internal trouble ... I worry
about the potential for social disorder," he added.</P>
      <P>In a detailed statement on financial aid to crisis-hit Indonesia,
Australia's Federal Treasury warned that the aid package for
Indonesia from the IMF and Australia was conditional on the
implementation of tough IMF reforms.</P>
      <P>But the reforms demanded by the IMF have sparked a number of
riots across Indonesia in recent weeks. More trouble was expected
overnight after an estimated 6,000 people stoned shops and other

    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia and mainland China have agreed
on the importance of eliminating weapons of mass destruction and the
need for Iraq to comply with UN Security Council resolutions as well
as the desirability of a peaceful resolution to the Gulf crisis.</P>
      <P>The agreement was reached between Australia's Defense Minister
Ian McLachlan and mainland Chinese Defense Minister Chi Haotian
during a meeting in Canberra on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Chi is visiting Australia, becoming the most senior military
official to visit this country from the mainland since the June 1989
Tiananmen Square massacre.</P>
      <P>In a press release Thursday, McLachlan said: "The visit of
General Chi raises the defense relationship to a new level. It
provided the opportunity to discuss a whole range of important issues
which are the common concern of both Australia and China."</P>
      <P>But defense sources said Chi disagreed with McLachlan on
Australia's dispatch of 190 elite troops to Kuwait in support of the
U.S.-led war against Iraq.</P>
      <P>In reviewing bilateral defense relations, both ministers agreed
that the three priorities for further developments between the two
countries would be regular meetings between defense ministers and
military commanders, enhanced dialogue on strategic developments and
defense policies, and continued exchanges at middle and junior
officer levels.</P>
      <P>McLachlan has accepted an invitation to visit mainland China soon
and other Australian military brasshats -- Gen. John Sanderson, the
chief of the Australian Army, and Maj. Gen. Jim Connolly, commander
of the Australian Theater, will also travel to the mainland later
this year.</P>
      <P>The statement also mentioned that an unnamed senior mainland
Chinese officer will visit Australia for a second round of defense
talks.</P>
      <P>In a speech to about 100 students of the Australian College of
Defense and Strategic Studies in Canberra on Tuesday, Chi said
Beijing pursues a national defense policy which is defensive in
nature and its defense construction neither is directed against nor
poses a threat to any other country.</P>
      <P>"The basic goals of China's defense policy are to consolidate
national defense, resist foreign aggression, defend the nation's
sovereignty over its territorial land, sea and airspace as well as
its maritime rights and interests and safeguard national unity and
security," he said. Chi has met Prime Minister John Howard, Foreign
Minister Alexander Downer and other senior Australian officials
during his visit in Canberra and other cities.</P>
      <P>But Chi's visit to Australia is marked by secret meetings with
Australian leaders because he is worried about possible
demonstrations by Chinese dissidents or Tibetans because he was
involved in the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre, analysts here said.</P>

    <DATELINE>Singapore,  Feb.  20  (CNA)
(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Singapore government is reviewing
some of the specific restrictions on the use of the Singapore dollar,
although it will stick largely by its current policy of not
encouraging its internationalization, Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien
Loong said in Parliament on Thursday.</P>
      <P>"The basic rationale for not encouraging the internationalization
of the Singapore dollar remains valid," he said.</P>
      <P>"If the Singapore dollar is widely held and used internationally,
our influence over the exchange rate would diminish, making the
currency more vulnerable in a speculative attack even though our
sound fundamentals make it unlikely that such attacks will eventually
succeed."</P>
      <P>Lee pointed out that a lack of market demand was the primary
reason why the Singapore dollar had not become internationalized.</P>
      <P>Indeed, he noted, if there had been market demand for Singapore
dollars, the government's policy against the extension of credit in
the local currency to nonresidents could not have prevented it from
being internationalized.</P>
      <P>"However, within this framework, we are reviewing some of the
specific restrictions on the use of the Singapore dollar with a view
to making adjustments that can help to further develop the financial
sector particularly in the area of capital markets," he said.</P>
      <P>Earlier, Lee said the government had not received any specific
proposal to use the Singapore dollar as a common trading currency
among the ASEAN countries, in response to a legislator's question.</P>
      <P>He said that the Singapore dollar did not have the prerequisites
for being used in that way, adding that the local currency did not
qualify for the role as the size of the economy was too small and the
amount of the currency in international circulation was not
substantial.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FAST BY MAINLAND CHINESE DEMOCRACY ACTIVISTS GOES INTO 4TH DAY</HEADLINE>

(By Huang Kwan-chun and Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A fast initiated by exiled mainland
Chinese democracy activists in front of the United Nations
headquarters in New York headed into its fourth day on Thursday.</P>
      <P>The demonstration, in which participants have taken turns
fasting, is aimed at securing the release of Wang Tingjin and all
other dissidents from mainland Chinese jails. The demonstrators are
gaining increasing support.</P>
      <P>The protest against the Beijing authorities started at noon on
Feb. 16. Each day one activist stages a sit-in in front of the U.N.
headquarters and fasts for 24 hours before being relieved by another
colleague. The relay was taken up on Thursday by Wei Guomin, a senior
activist who was one of the leaders of the democratic movement in
Shanghai in 1979.</P>
      <P>The fasting activities during the first three days were conducted
by Wang Bingzhang, who slipped into mainland China in early February
under a pseudonym only to be expelled after his arrest by mainland
Chinese police; Zhang Lin, a dissident from Anhui Province; and Bao
Gu, a member of the national committee of the mainland-based Human
Rights Call.</P>
      <P>Fu Shunqi, spokesman for the overseas preparatory section of the
Chinese Justice Party, who acted as a coordinator for the relay fast
activity, said that World Chinese United Entity representative Hua
Xiazhi, who was originally scheduled to take up the fast on Friday,
would be replaced by another activist as he has not felt well
recently. Hua will join the protest next week.</P>
      <P>According to the present schedule, a representative of the China
Liberal Democratic Party will fast on Feb. 21 and democratic movement
veteran Chen Jun will join the relay on Feb. 22.</P>
      <P>In addition, overseas Chinese organizations such as the Institute
of China Strategy, Alliance for Democratic China, China Democratic
Front, and Alliance for a Democratic China, all are considering
whether to assign representatives to join the demonstration.</P>
      <P>In addition to urging Beijing to release Wang Tingjin and all
other dissidents, Fu stressed, the activity is also aimed at
convincing the United Nations Committee on Human Rights to pay more
attention to mainland China's human rights conditions.</P>
      <P>Wang, a teacher from China's Anhui Province was sentenced to two
years in prison for his involvement in the Democracy Wall Movement in
1979. Following a meeting with Wang Bingzhan on Feb. 6, both men were
seized in the city of Bengbu, Anhui Province. Mainland Chinese public
security police have not given the reasons for Wang Tingjin's arrest,
and visits by his relatives have been prohibited.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  20  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The pilots of China Airlines (CAL)
A300-600F aircraft have started a series of retraining courses, while
CAL crew members report a sharp increase in leave-taking, Yang Cheng,
a spokesman for the airline, said on Friday.</P>
      <P>Yang said that all 107 CAL pilots are taking the 24-hour
retraining courses, including a four-hour flight simulation. Airbus
Industrie, maker of the A300-600F, has sent officials to help conduct
the courses, which are expected to be completed in three weeks.</P>
      <P>The retraining directive followed the Civil Aeronautics
Administration's decision to ground the CAL's fleet of nine A300-600F
aircraft after the same type of plane crashed near CKS International
Airport in Taoyuan County Monday night, killing all 196 persons
onboard and six others on the ground after it slammed into a
residential area.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's worst-ever air disaster has also dealt a heavy blow to
the morale of CAL employees.</P>
      <P>Yang reported that the number of CAL crew members requesting
leaves of absence has increased sharply to nearly 7 percent after the
crash, compared with between 3 percent to 5 percent before the
tragedy.</P>
      <P>But he denied anyone has tendered his or her resignation after
the CAL crash.</P>
      <P>On behalf of CAL's 8,000 employees, Yang also said that they have
the right to earn a living, and that the fate of the company should
not be dictated by legislators.</P>
      <P>He was responding to calls by some lawmakers for the dissolution
of CAL because of a series of aviation accidents in recent years.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taoyuan District Court Chief Prosecutor Tien Ping-lin
reported that his office has issued death certificates for 106 of the
crash victims. But to avoid any mistakes, he said, it has ordered
that those bodies which have already been identified not be cremated
before the completion of DNA sampling, expected to be finished later
this week.</P>
      <P>As of Friday morning, 90 victims out of the 196 who perished in
the air disaster have yet to be identified by their relatives. The
National Dentist Association has sent a team to facilitate the
identification process by means of dental records.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the two "black box" data recorders from the ill-fated
CAL A-300 Airbus were taken to Australia for analysis Thursday night.</P>
      <P>A five-man team of CAL and Civil Aeronautics Administration
officials as well as prosecutors, escorted the plane's cockpit voice
recorder and its digital flight data recorder to Australia.</P>
      <P>The team is scheduled to return to Taipei in a week after the
analyses of the black boxes are completed.</P>

      <P>Around 2,000 University of Indonesia
students marched around their campus in Depok, West Java on Thursday,
demanding food security, employment and political reform.</P>
      <P>The students also delivered a scathing attack on the New Order
government which they claimed has failed to keep the people's
mandate.</P>
      <P>"The government should, in full awareness and peacefully,
resign," the Jakarta Post quoted the students as saying in a
statement signed by seven leaders.</P>
      <P>After demanding the government step down, however, the students
demanded it should provide people with basic commodities at
affordable prices, and immediately address soaring unemployment.</P>
      <P>"We demand political reform as a prerequisite for total reform."
the students said.</P>
      <P>The students also demanded a change of the national leadership
and that the government stand accountable for the nation's current
social, economic and political crises.</P>
      <P>"The country is bankrupt because of the various mistakes
committed by the government. Corruption is rampant, as is nepotism,
while capital is concentrated only in a small group, (aggravated by)
legal uncertainty and repression of people's political rights," the
statement said.</P>
      <P>They also called on fellow students across the country to press
for the same reform agenda.</P>
      <P>Student sources said the demonstration might well be followed by
similar events at universities in several other towns.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER SIEW HOLDS OUT OLIVE BRANCH TO BEIJING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  20  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Vincent Siew held out an olive
branch to mainland China again on Friday as he delivered an
administrative report at the Legislative Yuan's first plenary session
of the year.</P>
      <P>Siew called for the holding of a second "Koo-Wang meeting" as
early as possible in accordance with an agreement reached between
Taipei's Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) and the Beijing-based
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) in May
1995.</P>
      <P>"By convening the long-stalled Koo-Wang meeting, the two sides
can discuss any topic that is helpful to the peaceful development on
both sides of the Taiwan Strait and to China's eventual reunification
under freedom and democracy," Siew noted.</P>
      <P>The premier pointed out that the Republic of China government has
spared no effort to promote bilateral exchanges and consultations
with a view to maintaining cross-strait harmony, peace and stability.</P>
      <P>Noting that the National Unification Guidelines have been a basic
tenet of Taiwan's mainland policy, Siew reaffirmed that promoting
China's eventual reunification based on the principles of freedom,
democracy and prosperity is the ROC's unswerving ultimate goal.</P>
      <P>Siew went on to say that mainland China's political and economic
development has been moving in a clearer, more definite direction
since Hong Kong's handover last July and the smooth conclusion of the
15th national congress of the Chinese Communist Party in September
1997. Mainland authorities have also since shown a more positive
attitude toward the resumption of cross-strait dialogue.</P>
      <P>"All these developments have catapulted cross-strait relations
into a new stage," Siew said, adding that, at this critical juncture,
the two sides should treasure the results of their previous
negotiations.</P>
      <P>In 1992, the two sides reached a consensus that each could uphold
its own definition of the "one China" principle. In April 1993, SEF
Chairman C.F. Koo and ARATS Chairman Wang Daohan held their first
meeting in Singapore, laying a framework for regular dialogue and
consultations on issues of mutual concern. In May 1995, SEF and ARATS
officials met to discuss technical and procedural issues related to
the convening of a second Koo-Wang meeting. The two sides already
agreed to begin negotiations on a broad range of topics during the
1995 meeting.</P>
      <P>However, Beijing unilaterally suspended the institutionalized
SEF-ARATS dialogue in mid-1995 to vent its anger at ROC President Lee
Teng-hui's landmark visit to the United States in June that year as
it interpreted Lee's trip as a veiled move to promote Taiwan
independence.</P>
      <P>Siew said Taiwan has consistently abided by all previous
cross-strait agreements and points of consensus over the past two
years and eight months. "We firmly believe that only when both sides
can uphold their promises or agreements can they gradually forge
mutual trust and lay a solid foundation for future bilateral talks on
a broad range of issues, including political consultations," Siew
claimed.</P>
      <P>He stressed that Taiwan has consistently adopted a positive,
active and optimistic attitude toward the development of cross-strait
relations. "We have also incessantly explained our basic concepts and
attitudes to mainland authorities via various channels and means,"
the premier said, adding that Taiwan has always kept its doors open
for cross-strait dialogue and has repeatedly urged Beijing to resume
long-stalled institutionalized consultations.</P>
      <P>Siew said he is pleased to see that mainland authorities have
shown willingness to resume dialogue with Taiwan in their recent
talks. "We welcome this development."</P>
      <P>So long as mainland China agrees to hold a second Koo-Wang
meeting, Siew said, Taiwan is willing to discuss "in a gradual
manner" any topic helpful to peaceful development on both sides of
the Taiwan Strait and to China's reunification under a democratic
system, particularly certain practical issues that have arisen from
cross-strait civilian exchanges.</P>
      <P>The two sides previously agreed to jointly work out measures to
resolve cross-strait fishing disputes and crack down on smuggling of
firearms and other contraband goods across the Taiwan Strait. "As
these issues have critical impact on rights and interests of people
on both sides, we should give them top priority," Siew said.</P>
      <P>He also reaffirmed Taiwan's sincerity and good will in promoting
cross-strait engagement and rapprochement. "We'll work to reduce
animosity through communications and replace confrontation with
negotiations," he pledged, adding that Taiwan will also boost
bilateral exchanges based on the principles of equality, reciprocity
and mutual respect.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 20 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A heated confrontation broke out on Friday
at a joint meeting of the Taiwan Provincial Assembly to screen the
land-lease contract which would allow German chemical giant Bayer to
build a plant in central Taiwan's Taichung County.</P>
      <P>A bitter war of words erupted after Assemblyman Wang Shih-hsun
accused Tseng Tsai Mei-tzou, convenor of the Transportation Committee
under the Taiwan Provincial Assembly, of receiving money from Bayer.</P>
      <P>Tseng Tsai Mei-tzou, cursing Wang and pounding the table, angrily
denied that she has received anything from the company.</P>
      <P>Because of the bitter outburst, the joint meeting had to adjourn
at noon, and the two groups ultimately decided to do their screening
separately.</P>
      <P>The Transportation Committee and an ad hoc team were originally
set to present the results of the screening for discussion on the
floor of assembly by Feb. 26.</P>
      <P>Horst Mueck, chairman of Bayer Taiwan Co., and Chen Chia-chung, a
spokesman for the company, both went to the provincial assembly in
central Taiwan to express their concern about the screening process
by the teams from the assembly.</P>
      <P>They denied having delivered any form of payment to facilitate
the establishment of the toluene di-isocyantate (TDI) plant in
Taichung Harbor.</P>
      <P>They denied having given money to secure the US$1.5 billion
investment project. Nor have promises been made to allow any company
to undertake the construction work, they said.</P>
      <P>As Bayer has not even decided to build the plant in Taiwan, how
could there be promises on construction work or payments, they asked.</P>
      <P>Mueck said that Taiwan is a respectable nation, and that so far
no one has asked for any benefits from Bayer in connection with the
project. The company would rather construct the plant elsewhere than
resort to bribery in order to secure the project, he added.</P>
      <P>Mueck then greeted a group of onlookers who had gathered in
support of the project. He also tried to approach a group which was
opposed to the project, but had to give up the attempt as police kept
the two camps separated.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislators of the nation's three major
political parties said Friday that the managing system of the China
Airlines (CAL) must be improved in order to ensure its flight safety.</P>
      <P>In the "Forum on National Affairs" of the Legislative Yuan,
legislators of the ruling Kuomintang and the two major opposition
parties, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and the New Party
(NP), made the same demand.</P>
      <P>Leaders of the DPP and NP caucuses in the Legislative Yuan also
said that Tsai Chao-yang, minister of the Ministry of Transportation
and Communications, should resign immediately to take responsibility
for the tragic crash of a CAL A-300 Airbus Monday at the Chiang
Kai-shek International Airport in suburban Taipei.</P>
      <P>A total of 202 people were killed in the accident. Another CAL
A-300 Airbus crashed at Nagoya Airport in Japan, killing 264 people,
less than four years ago. There were 12 crashes of CAL jetliners in
the past 20 years.</P>
      <P>Two legislators of the ruling Kuomintang said however that it is
inappropriate to demand the resignation of government officials
before the cause of the air accident is found out.</P>
      <P>Leaders of the DPP caucus also said the China Aviation
Development Foundation, which controls 71 percent of the airlines'
shares and is responsible for its operations and management, should
be reorganized immediately. Some other legislators of the opposition
party said that all of the airlines' shares should be sold to private
investors as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Premier Vincent Siew said Friday at the Legislative
Yuan that it would be better to sell CAL shares after the airlines'
operations and its share prices return to a normal level. CAL shares
have dropped dramatically in the stock market since Tuesday because

    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia's first anti-HIV drug will be
tested and marketed in mainland China because the developer here was
unable to get sufficient funding for research from the Australian
government.</P>
      <P>John Majewski, chief executive officer of Narhex Operations, told
reporters the anti-HIV drug his company developed will be given
trials in mainland China and manufactured there.</P>
      <P>Narhex Operations signed a letter of intent Thursday with
mainland China's largest pharmaceutical maker -- the North China
Pharmaceutical Company -- for the trial and sales of its anti-HIV
drug in the mainland.</P>
      <P>Thirty HIV-infected people will begin the three-month trial "as
early as possible," Majewski said, adding that if it is successful,
the two companies will form a joint venture to develop a commercial
product for sale in mainland China and possibly elsewhere.</P>
      <P>Majewski said he originally planned to have his anti-HIV drug
tested in Australia and then manufactured here, but that a lack of
funding for research prevented him from doing so.</P>
      <P>"I have been very disappointed with the federal government's
support. Several times we applied for grants, and it was felt that we
wouldn't be successful, so we did not get the grants," he said.</P>
      <P>This is the first time Western synthesized medicine for
HIV-infected people will be given a trial on humans in mainland
China, he said.</P>
      <P>Narhex Operations is known for a range of skin treatments that
use cross-linked elastin.</P>
      <P>The drug to be tested in mainland China is called Nar DG-35 and
was first developed in Australia. It was first subjected to trials in
Melbourne in 1995, and new trials will be conducted in April in
Australia, mainland China and possibly Brazil, Majewski said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>On a three-month moving average basis,
Singapore's total trade at current prices expanded by 3.2 percent
last month, while on a monthly basis, it dropped by 7.7 percent as
compared to that in January of last year, the Singapore Trade
Development Board (TDB) said Friday.</P>
      <P>During the month, exports and imports grew by 5.5 percent and 1.1
percent respectively.</P>
      <P>The total value of external trade last month amounted to S$28.48
billion (US$17.37 billion), lower than the total of S$34.29 billion
registered in December 1997, according to figures released by the
TDB.</P>
      <P>Non-oil domestic exports increased by 7.8 percent to reach S$7.3
billion last month. Non-oil domestic exports to the United States and
the European Union remained strong, expanding by 12.5 percent and
16.0 percent respectively on the back of strong economic growth in
these two economies. Nevertheless, non-oil domestic exports to
Malaysia and Japan declined by 5.7 percent and 7.6 percent
respectively, the TDB said.</P>
      <P>Domestic exports of oil continued to be weak last month,
declining by 16.3 percent due mainly to lower shipments of oil to the
Asian region, it said.</P>
      <P>Non-oil reexports increased by 7.7 percent to reach S$6.1 billion
last month, due mainly to increases in reexports of integrated
circuits, computer parts and peripherals, disk drives, transistors,
semiconductors, parts of aircraft, parts of VCRs, printers and
unwrought gold.</P>
      <P>It said Singapore's non-oil imports grew by 2.4 percent to reach

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Statistics Department under the
Ministry of Economic Affairs estimated on Friday that Taiwan's trade
surplus will slide to US$7.5 billion in 1998 as a result of a reduced
world trade volume.</P>
      <P>The department, citing data compiled by the Washington Economic
Forecast Association, said the world trade volume is expected to fall
by 7 percent, and that the world's annual economic growth rate will
average at about 2.6 percent.</P>
      <P>It forecast that major developed countries will post an average
economic growth rate of 2.4 percent this year, while Pacific-rim
countries, affected by last year's financial woes plaguing the Asian
region, will see their average economic growth rate drop to 0.4
percent in 1998 from the 4.9 percent registered in 1997. It will take
some Asian countries two years to recover from the current morass,
the department added.</P>
      <P>Despite the outbreak of a foot-and-mouth disease epidemic at hog
farms island-wide and the resulting ban on Taiwan's pork exports last
year, Taiwan's exports still increased by 5.3 percent for the whole
of 1997, while imports grew by 11.8 percent as a result of a
recovering domestic market, leaving Taiwan with a trade surplus of
US$7.64 billion, down 43.7 percent from the previous year.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, private-sector consumption, boosted by the partial
implementation of the five-day work week in the government sector,
the mayoral elections in Taipei and Kaohsiung cities and an
islandwide legislative election, will grow by 6.8 percent this year,
the department predicted, adding that on the other hand, investment
by the government in public construction projects will rise by 3.4
percent.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PM SIEW ORDERS FORMATION OF AVIATION SAFETY COMMISSION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  20  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Vincent Siew said on Friday he
has ordered the Ministry of Transportation and Communications
(MOTC) to set up a special commission to oversee aircraft safety and
investigate flight accidents.</P>
      <P>Siew made the remarks while reporting on Monday's crash of a
China Airlines Airbus A300-600F jetliner at a Legislative Yuan
plenary meeting. The crash resulted in the death of 202 people,
including Central Bank of China Governor Sheu Yuan-dong, his wife
and four other senior central bank officials.</P>
      <P>The premier said the MOTC's Civil Aeronautics Administration is
responsible for supervising operations of airline companies. "The
ministry should set up a separate commission to inspect all
commercial aircraft and investigate flight accidents in order to
improve aviation safety controls.</P>
      <P>Siew said he was saddened by the latest air disaster, asking the
bereaved families of all crash victims to accept his condolences on
the death of their loved ones. "We'll do our utmost to handle the
aftermath to comfort the souls of the deceased," he pledged, adding
that the government will also step up aviation safety controls to
avoid similar accidents in future.</P>
      <P>Siew told the lawmakers that the Executive Yuan has formed a
special task force to organize a memorial service for the deceased
and to study measures to help their bereaved families resolve
difficulties they may face in future daily lives and education.</P>
      <P>The premier further said the government will push China
Airlines (CAL), the Republic of China's flagship carrier, to overhaul
its leadership and management team, hiring outstanding civil
aviation managers to draft and implement a comprehensive
restructuing plan.</P>
      <P>Siew expressed his hope that the carrier's largest shareholder,
the China Aviation Development Foundation which controls 70 percent
of CAl' stake, will use its funds to help upgrade flight safety
controls of all of Taiwan's commercial carriers.</P>
      <P>"We also expect the foundation to gradually sell its CAL stock
holdings to qualified private investors after the carrier's business
returns to normal," Siew said. "We believe privatization will be the
best way to improve CAL's corporate image and upgrade its management
and competitiveness."</P>
      <P>The premier went on to say that the country should not feel
complacent about the first-grade rating given by the US Federal
Aviation Administration last year to Taiwan's flight safety control
measures. "We should make continued efforts to improve civil aviation
safety and cannot allow any flight accidents to happen again."</P>
      <P>Siew said the Cabinet has directed the MOTC to adopt several
measures to ensure flight safety:</P>
      <P>-- Encouraging local carriers to use larger planes to replace
smaller ones to improve traffic to remote areas or offshore islands;</P>
      <P>-- Encouraging civil aviation companies to strengthen
cooperation and pool their resources to upgrade service quality and
safety controls;</P>
      <P>-- Demanding the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) to
conduct across-the-board inspection of flight safety control systems
at all commercial carriers, with China Airlines as the first target;
to require all carriers to faithfully implement a cockpit crew and
resources management system; and to upgrade professionalism of all
CAA inspectors.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA)
will send a delegation of trade officials and chemical experts to
the United States in late March to seek feasible measures to cope
with the possible impact on Taiwan's chemical industry of the United
Nations-initiated Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC).</P>
      <P>The convention, which regulates global trade in some chemical
products that could be used to produce chemical weapons, already
took effect on April 29, 1997. A total of 166 countries around the
world have signed the convention aimed at maintaining world peace.</P>
      <P>As the Republic of China has been shut out of the UN since 1971,
it's not easy for the ROC to become a CWC signatory.</P>
      <P>According to the convention, non-signatory countries or those
who fail to abide by its provisions will be subject to trade
sanctions.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is the world's 11th largest chemical products
manufacturing country. Its trade in CWC-regulated chemical products
could be adversely affected in the future.</P>
      <P>According to MOEA tallies, Taiwan's pesticide, dyeing,
pharmaceutical industries and even electric bulb and leatherware
industries may be hit hardest. The annual production of these
products amounts to NT$15 million (US$454,546).</P>
      <P>CWC-regulated products account for a large share of
annual Taiwan-US chemical trade. The MOEA delegation will discuss
with relevant American officials on how to regulate bilateral trade
in those products in accordance with the UN convention in the
future.</P>
      <P>MOEA officials said the ministry has set up a 16-member task
force to mull strategy to address the convention's possible adverse

    <HEADLINE>TAIPEI MAYOR WANTS TO VISIT MAINLAND CHINA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  20  (CNA)
(By Bear Lee)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Chen Shui-bian of the
opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) said on Friday that he
would like to serve as a pioneer for an eventual visit to mainland
China by President Lee Teng-hui.</P>
      <P>"How can Lee, as the head of state, pay a trip to the mainland if
a local government head like me is barred from going there?" asked
Chen at a Taipei seminar co-sponsored by the Cabinet-level Mainland
Affairs Council and the National Policy Research Institute. The mayor
has maintained high approval ratings in public polls and is widely
considered to be the DPP's best choice to challenge the presidency in
the 2000 election.</P>
      <P>President Lee declared in his inaugural speech in May, 1996 that
he would like to make a "journey of peace" to the mainland as part of
the Republic of China's efforts to promote China's unification.</P>
      <P>Chen said he is pessimistic about the prospects for a mainland
China visit by Lee before cross-strait tension is substantially
eased. "I would therefore like to take the initiative by visiting the
mainland first to pave the way for Lee's trip there," he announced.</P>
      <P>Vigorously promoting the DPP's policy of seeking Taiwan
independence, Chen said the opposition has not changed its stance
regarding the pursuit of independence for the island.</P>
      <P>The outspoken mayor pointed out that during his party's three-day
debate on its policy towards mainland China on Feb. 13-15, none of
the delegates from any of the major DPP factions questioned the
credibility of the "Taiwan independence" article in its party
platform.</P>
      <P>"This demonstrates that the DPP maintains the pursuit of Taiwan
independence as its top guideline in policy towards the other side of
the Taiwan Strait," Chen said.</P>
      <P>He said that the so-called "Taiwan issue" is an international
issue rather than "an issue of the Taiwan Strait" as defined by Vice
President Lien Chan at a Thursday session of the same seminar.</P>
      <P>However, Chen was also critical of the consensus reached by his
comrades at the DPP policy debate, which calls for "comprehensive
negotiations" between Taiwan and the mainland.</P>
      <P>"How can there be comprehensive talks between the two sides
before deeper and wider contacts are forged?" Chen asked. He instead
suggested a step-by-step approach of "contacts, dialogue and
negotiations" in handling such exchanges.</P>
      <P>He said he would like to invite the mayors of Beijing and
Shanghai to the World Capitals' Forum to be held in Taipei in May if
the mainland authorities are interested in the event. More than 50
capital city mayors from all over the world are expected to take part
in the forum, which will be hosted by Taipei for the first time.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The German business weekly "Wirtschaftswoche"
(Economic Weekly) has reported in its latest issue that Hong
Kong-based fund managers are upbeat about the outlook of the Taiwan
bourse.</P>
      <P>The magazine said that the financial markets of
Shanghai\Shenzhen, Hong Kong and Taipei are the three major
playgrounds of German China funds.</P>
      <P>Citing three China funds -- Atlas Chine, ABN China Equity Fund
and TGS China Fund -- as examples, the weekly said that their
investments in Hong Kong usually made up 65 percent of their total
investments in ethnic Chinese areas worldwide, followed by their
investments in Shanghai\Shenzhen. The Taiwan bourse accounted for
about 10 percent of their total investments.</P>
      <P>However, the recent steep plunge in the prices of real estate and
stock in Hong Kong and Shanghai have made Taiwan a relatively safe
haven for investment, which has forced fund managers to review their
portfolios, the report said.</P>
      <P>Among the 1,030 mutual funds listed in Germany, China-related
funds posted the best showing over the last week, with Atlas China,
ABN China Equity Fund and TGS China Fund ranked among the top-five.</P>
      <P>At the bottom of the list were funds exclusively for investment
in non-Chinese areas of Asia, with Dresdner Th. Korea, GT Korean
Growth, Fidelity Thailand, Fidelity Korea and Barings Korea showing
the poorest performances.</P>

    <DATELINE>Singapore,  Feb.  20 (CNA)
(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>US Secretary of Commerce William Daley
stressed here on Friday that the United States has a strong and
long-standing commitment to Asia as a whole.</P>
      <P>In his address to the American Chamber of Commerce in Singapore,
Daley said that his meetings with government and business leaders in
Japan, South Korea and Singapore during his current trip have
provided enormous insight into the region's economic situation.</P>
      <P>"I come away convinced that this crisis is a defining moment for
Southeast Asia, perhaps the most important period in ASEAN's economic
30-year history," he said.</P>
      <P>The decisions made now, in the face of this crisis regarding
economic reform and trade liberalization, "will determine the ASEAN
economy for the next thirty years," he added.</P>
      <P>Daley said he was "proud to say American firms are in the region
for the long haul." This continued US commercial engagement is
important for not only ASEAN but also the United States, he stressed.</P>
      <P>Noting that he was impressed by the plans of many US companies,
he pointed out that they not only want to continue their operations
in the region but to expand them. "This reflects their confidence
that the region will rebound -- and it will create exports and jobs
in the United States, as well," he said.</P>
      <P>The countries in Southeast Asia have great underlying strengths,
he noted, citing their high savings rates, firm commitments to
education and strong work ethic. With a sustained commitment to the
necessary reforms, they are well-positioned to re-establish strong
economic growth and sound currencies, he added.</P>
      <P>US companies will be an integral part of the resurgent growth in
Southeast Asia, Daley asserted.</P>
      <P>He also announced Friday that US ambassadors and senior
commercial officers in ASEAN have developed a commercial strategy
initiative intended to energize US government attention toward
business opportunities in the ASEAN region during this time of
significant economic change.</P>
      <P>"We will identify and help US businesses to take advantage of new
export and investment opportunities -- despite current economic
conditions -- because we believe in this market's long-term
potential," he said.</P>
      <P>Daley, who flew into Singapore Thursday morning from Seoul for a
two-day visit, called on Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong and Senior
Minister Lee Kuan Yew Friday afternoon after holding a meeting with
Trade and Industry Minister Lee Yock Suan.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  20  (CNA)
(By Lin Wen-fen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Twelve of the victims of the ill-fated
China Airlines (CAL) flight 676 which crashed on Monday have now been
identified by DNA testing, bringing the total number of identified
bodies to 114 out of 202, an official with the Ministry of the
Transportation and Communications (MOTC) said on Friday.</P>
      <P>Vice Transport Minister Chen Shih-chi said that since it takes 14
hours to complete DNA analysis of a single blood sample, three to
five more days are needed to complete DNA matching of the blood
samples taken from relatives and the victims' remains.</P>
      <P>A total of 500 blood samples have been collected, including over
100 from direct family members -- parents or children -- of the
victims. DNA testing is the last hope for these families to identify
the remains of their loved ones.</P>
      <P>However, in some cases where all the members of a family died in
the crash, no blood samples from direct relatives were available, so
the identification process will be longer.</P>
      <P>The remains of the six foreigners -- five Americans and an
Indonesian -- who were passengers on the ill-fated airplane en route
to Taipei from the resort island of Bali, have not yet been
identified, Chen added.</P>
      <P>He said that a number of relatives have identified sets of
remains by appearance or through other evidence, such as dental
records, which means the possibility of wrong identification exists.
For this reason, Chen asked those relatives who have claimed the
remains of their loved ones not to cremate the bodies until the
identification process is complete.</P>
      <P>Early on Friday morning, eight large refrigerated shipping
containers were taken to the Panchiao morgue in Taipei County, where
the remains of the victims of Taiwan's worst-ever air disaster are
being kept. As no more room is available in the freezer of the
Panchiao morgue, the containers will serve as emergency cold storage
units.</P>
      <P>For days, the remains of the unidentified victims, covered in
golden-yellow sheets, have been kept in thin caskets and left lying
on the wet and sometimes rain-flooded ground. By 4:00 a.m., the 121
caskets with remains were loaded into six of the containers, while
another 56 caskets containing only charred remnants were placed in
the other two.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Foreign Ministry of the Republic of
China on Friday rebutted a recent report by the Los Angeles Times,
saying that the ROC enjoys widespread support in the US Congress and
that ROC President Lee Teng-hui's historic US visit in 1995 was not
the result of a financial deal.</P>
      <P>Ministry spokesman Roy Wu stressed that the ROC has strong
support from a majority of both Republican and Democratic Congressmen
and that Lee's 1995 visit was favorably backed by the US Congress and
leading media.</P>
      <P>Denouncing the Wednesday report by the Los Angeles Times as
"false," Wu said the nonpartisan support enjoyed by the ROC in the US
Congress is reflected in its voting patterns, speeches and resolution
records at both the Senate and the House of Representatives.</P>
      <P>Wu also categorically denied the newspaper's report that the ROC
government used an "inappropriate approach" to win US popular support
for Lee's trip.</P>
      <P>He said the House passed a unanimous resolution at the time,
welcoming Lee's visit to the US by a vote of 396 to zero, while the
Senate approved a similar resolution by a vote of 97 to one. Major US
newspapers such as the Washington Post and the New York Times also
printed editorials voicing support for Lee's visit, he added.</P>

(By Lillian Lin &amp; Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A spokesman for Bayer's German headquarters
on Friday refused to comment on the raucous debate in a Taiwan local
legislature over the firm's multi-billion investment project in
Taiwan, but said he regrets that the whole issue has been
politicized.</P>
      <P>The spokesman told CNA in a telephone interview from Dormagen,
western Germany, that he didn't know the project pitted supporters
against opponents in a fierce confrontation outside the Taiwan
Provincial Assembly on Friday morning, when a land-lease contract for
the project was being debated by a committee of the assembly.</P>
      <P>However, he had heard about a similar scuffle between the
opponents and supporters which took place on Monday, when an ad hoc
panel of the Taiwan Provincial Assembly decided to postpone any
decision on the contract. The fistfight, caught by TV cameras, was
broadcast worldwide.</P>
      <P>Recounting the two Taiwan fact-finding delegations which visited
Bayer headquarters recently to see the measures the company has taken
to ensure plant safety, the spokesman said that although Bayer has
done its best to convince Taiwan residents that its proposed chemical
plant in Taiwan is technically safe, the controversy surrounding the
issue has been politicized.</P>
      <P>A Bayer executive for East Asia said his firm has dropped plans
to launch a publicity campaign for its project at Taichung Harbor,
central Taiwan, and will instead resign the fate of the project to
the authorities and people of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Liu Yu-shan, a vice chairman of Taiwan's Council for
Economic Planning and Development, who headed a fact-finding
delegation to Bayer's German headquarters earlier this month, said on
Friday in Taipei that his council will organize a televised public
hearing on the issue and conduct opinion polls as the Taiwan
Provincial Assembly has suggested.</P>
      <P>The results of the polls will be used as an important reference

    <HEADLINE>TAIPEI DENIES MEETING BETWEEN MAC, ARATS HEADS</HEADLINE>

      <P>Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) on
Friday denied that its chairman, Chang King-yuh, met secretly with
Beijing's point man in dealing with Taiwan in January.</P>
      <P>In a statement, the MAC said that Chang went to Tokyo in January
to attend an academic seminar which was scheduled about six months
ago and coincided by chance with a trip to Japan by Wang Daohan,
chairman of the Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Straits (ARATS), the mainland China body charged with dealing
with affairs related to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>They both stayed in the same Tokyo hotel at the same time, but
engaged in completely unrelated activities.</P>
      <P>The Hong Kong-based Chinese-language daily the "Economic Journal"
carried an unsubstantiated report on Friday that Chang met with Wang
secretly on that occasion and that an understanding on bilateral
issues was worked out.</P>
      <P>The newspaper claimed that the main point of their alleged
agreement includes the fact that the "one China" policy, which both
sides believe should be the cornerstone of bilateral ties and a
principle to which Taipei and Beijing both claim to be committed,
should refer neither to the People's Republic of China nor the
Republic of China.</P>
      <P>On his return from Tokyo on Jan. 12, Chang denied that he had met
with Wang, but didn't explain why he called a press conference at the
same hotel and at about the same time as Wang met the Japanese press.</P>
      <P>The MAC said in its statement that it has asked the Hong Kong
Economic Journal to correct its false report.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US, TAIWAN REACH AGREEMENT ON AGRICULTURAL CONCESSIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Feb. 20 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo &amp; Herman Pan)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan negotiators concluded bilateral
trade consultations with their counterparts from the United States on
Friday, agreeing to make major concessions on Taiwan's market-opening
to US agricultural exports.</P>
      <P>The agreement marked a big step forward towards Taiwan's
accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO), said Taipei
officials who participated in the marathon bilateral negotiations
which began in Washington, D.C. on Feb. 9.</P>
      <P>On one of the major sticking points, rice, Taiwan agreed to
follow the current Japanese model for rice imports under the WTO
framework, promising to open its rice market to US imports upon WTO
accession, with an import quota equivalent to 6.4 percent of its
total rice consumption between 1990 and 1992.</P>
      <P>If Taiwan's entry to the WTO is postponed until next year, this
quota will increase to 7.2 percent of the island's 1990-92 rice
consumption, gradually increasing to 8 percent in 2000, a total of
about 144,720 metric tons, according to the agreement.</P>
      <P>A portion of this quota will be allocated to the private sector
trade in rice, increasing from 21 percent to 35 percent in 2000 under
a "mark-up" system. The rest of the rice quota will be imported by
central authorities with conditions that will facilitate its release
for table use in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Taiwan originally offered an import quota of 4 percent of its
1990-1992 rice consumption, with the quota increasing by 0.8 percent
annually to 8 percent in five years.</P>
      <P>With regard to the pork market, Taiwan will lift its remaining
bans on selected pork cuts and variety meats immediately. Taiwan has
agreed to an immediate market opening of 5,000 tons of these
currently-banned pork cuts and 7,500 tons for pork variety meats from
the United States.</P>
      <P>Taiwan agreed to fully open its market for these pork products
and will establish a tariff rate quota (TRQ) system that will
gradually increase access until the market is completely open by
2005.</P>
      <P>Upon accession, Taiwan will fully open its market to many banned
pork cuts and establish a TRQ for the remaining restricted pork cuts,
bellies, and spare ribs and for pork variety meats. The quota for
pork bellies will be 6,610 tons, at 15 percent tariff, increasing to
15,400 tons at 12.5 percent tariff in 2004, before the market is
completely opened on Jan. 1, 2005. The quota for pork variety meats
will be 10,000 tons at 25 percent tariff, increasing to 27,500 tons
at 15 percent tariff in 2004.</P>
      <P>In the poultry market, Taiwan agreed to an immediate market
opening of 10,000 tons for US chicken meat at a tariff rate of 25
percent.</P>
      <P>Upon accession, Taiwan will establish a TRQ for chicken meat of
19,163 tons, growing to 45,990 tons by 2004 before the market is
completely opened on Jan. 1, 2005. The in-quota tariff rate for
chicken meat will be 25 percent upon accession, falling to 20 percent
by 2004.</P>
      <P>On beef and beef variety meats, Taiwan will provide immediate
market opening of 5,000 tons for US beef variety meats annually at
current tariff rates, with the unused amounts in any year to be
carried over to the next year.</P>
      <P>In addition, Taiwan agreed to completely open its market to
imports of beef variety meats upon accession at a tariff rate of 25
percent. Taiwan also has agreed to reduce the specific tariff for
beef from current rates to the equivalent of 14 US cents/pound
(NT$10/kilogram) by 2005. Current rates are NT$22.1/kilogram for
special quality beef and NT$30/kilogram for all other beef.</P>
      <P>During the talks on agricultural products, Taiwan agreed to
complete tariff-cut measures by 2002, but also won approval from the
US side on delayed schedules for 74 agricultural products until 2004,
the officials said.</P>
      <P>As compensation, Taiwan also agreed to lower import tariffs on 33
other agricultural items before or by 2000, they added.</P>

      <P>The Republic of China and the United

terms for entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO).</P>
      <P>In the 17th and final round of bilateral WTO talks, both sides

    <HEADLINE>ROC, US INITIAL BILATERAL WTO ACCORD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Feb. 20 (CNA)
(By Herman Pan and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China on Taiwan took a
historic step forward with its bid to join the World Trade
Organization (WTO) on Friday by concluding difficult and lengthy
negotiations with its largest trade partner, the United States, on
its WTO entry terms.</P>
      <P>Following 17 rounds of intensive talks spanning more than five
years, Taiwan and American negotiators have finally come to terms on
all the thorny WTO-related issues, with Taiwan agreeing to lower
trade barriers and offer greater market access to US agricultural
products, services, industrial goods, wine and tobacco.</P>
      <P>Stephen Chen, de facto ROC ambassador to the US, and American
Institute in Taiwan Chairman Richard Bush, initialed a comprehensive
WTO agreement on behalf of the two governments at the conclusion of
the marathon talks. Bush is the top US liaison officer with Taiwan in
the absence of official ties.</P>
      <P>ROC Economics Minister Wang Chih-kang and US Trade Representative
Charlene Barshefsky also attended the ceremony as witnesses to the
historic occasion. Scores of ROC officials and their counterparts
from the US departments of state, agriculture, treasury and
transportation took part in the final two-week round of talks in
Washington, D.C.</P>
      <P>Both Barshefsky and US Secretary of Agriculture Dan Glickman
hailed the newly signed agreement as a major victory for American
producers. Taiwan is America's seventh-largest trading partner.</P>
      <P>"This comprehensive agreement will dramatically open Taiwan's
markets to US agricultural products, services and industrial goods,"
Barshefsky told reporters.</P>
      <P>Glickman hailed the ground-breaking accord as a boon for American
agriculture, saying it will open up new export opportunities for a
wide range of farm and food products. "Taiwan, which is already one
of our largest export markets, has agreed to provide new access for
US poultry, pork and beef variety meats," he said.</P>
      <P>ROC Minister Wang said he is pleased to see a smooth conclusion
of the WTO talks with the US. In the process, Wang said, the American
negotiators have made many tough demands, but "through the concerted
efforts of our negotiators, we have managed to forge certain very
favorable terms," he noted.</P>
      <P>Teng Chen-chung, economic division chief at the ROC
representative office in the US, said the conclusion of the talks
with the US is absolutely a plus to Taiwan's overall national
interests and marks a new milestone in bilateral trade and economic
relations.</P>
      <P>Teng said both sides have made concessions in order to work out a
"win-win" agreement for both sides. For instance, the US originally
demanded that Taiwan adopt a single tariff rate for all pork products
and that the rate be lowered to 7.5 percent over a six-year period.
As a result of the difficult negotiations, Teng said, the US finally
agreed to the Taiwan-proposed tariff rate quota (TRQ) system that
will gradually increase access until the market is completely open by
2005.</P>
      <P>ROC Representative to the ROC Stephen Chen said the new agreement
will benefit both countries. "For the ROC, it marks a giant step
forward towards its goal of entering the Geneva-based world trade
regulatory body," he noted.</P>
      <P>AIT Chairman Bush said the pact is probably the most important
agreement ever signed by Taiwan and the US in recent years. "It
signifies that the deep and mutually beneficial relationship between
the people of the United States and the people of Taiwan is strong
and growing," he explained.</P>
      <P>Wang left for home shortly after the signing of the agreement,
which is scheduled to take effect on March 10 after the two sides
complete certain domestic formalities.</P>
      <P>Wang said prior to his departure that Taiwan will hold separate
WTO talks with Switzerland and the 15-member European Union next
week. They are the two remaining trade partners which have yet to
finalize bilateral trade consultations with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"We hope to conclude all bilateral talks before the end of March
in order to speed up our accession to the WTO," Wang added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US PORK PRODUCERS CALL WTO ACCORD A 'HOME RUN'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Feb.  21 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo &amp; Herman Pan)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The president of the US National Pork
Producers Council, Jerry King, called the agreement reached Friday
between Taiwan and US negotiators on terms for Taiwan's entry into
the World Trade Organization (WTO) a "home run" for US pork
producers.</P>
      <P>"Our trade negotiators have hit a home run for us in Taiwan,"
King said upon learning that Taiwan has agreed to lift its ban on the
import of US pork parts and set a quota of 12,500 tons of bellies,
cuts and variety meats worth US$18 million.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has also agreed to fully open its pork market for these US
pork products and will establish a tariff rate quota system that will
gradually increase access until the market is completely open by
2005.</P>
      <P>In his written statement, King said the latest agreement with
Taiwan will have an immediate and direct impact on American hog
farmers, who have been suffering through a prolonged price slump.</P>
      <P>According to a formal statement released by the office of the US
Trade Representative in the wake of the bilateral consultations
concerning Taiwan's accession to the WTO, Taiwan's market opening for
pork products provides immediate market opportunities for US farmers
of almost US$18 million. In the first year after accession, Taiwan's
pork import opportunities will increase by an additional US$22.5
million.</P>
      <P>According to the release, the agreement on rice provides US
farmers with a new market opportunity worth almost US$60 million in
the first year of implementation. Private traders will have direct
access to an increasingly large share of the quota (through a license
allocation system), which will allow US exporters to establish
long-standing relationships to promote the sale of US labeled rice in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>For US poultry farmers, the immediate market opening will provide
sales opportunities for them of almost US$10 million annually. Trade
in the first year of the tariff rate quota will reach US$18 million,
increasing to about US$43 million in 2004.</P>
      <P>For US beef producers, the immediate market access will provide
them market opportunities worth US$8.3 million. As Taiwan is
currently the seventh largest foreign market for US beef exports, the
lower tariffs should make US beef even more price competitive on the
island, the statement indicated.</P>

(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Firearms, drugs and economic crime are the
problems which have most undermined Taiwan's social fiber, Minister
of Justice Liao Cheng-hao said on Saturday.</P>
      <P>In a speech at a local college, Liao pointed out that political,
economic, and social development in recent years has frayed the old
value system, especially the prevailing attitude that "I can do
anything I want to," which tends to justify even illegal behavior and
seriously distorts the meaning of freedom.</P>
      <P>The unraveling of social order has contributed to the island's
bad name as "a land cash-rich but value-poor," "an island of greed,"
and "an island of filth," said Liao.</P>
      <P>The bad name might be exaggerated to some extent, but it should
still remind Taiwan's people of the importance of setting up and
maintaining a new system of social values, said Liao.</P>
      <P>Citing an example, Liao referred to notorious kidnapper and
murderer Cheng Chin-hsing, whose daring hostage-taking of a South
African diplomat and his family to demand the release of his wife and
accomplices in November was televised live islandwide. Cheng was
portrayed as a hero by the media, which seriously damaged social
values.</P>
      <P>Liao encouraged his audience to learn how to use their freedom
without losing their direction. In other words, they should learn to
play the game according to the rules.</P>
      <P>Democracy is a lifestyle which relies on order, emphasized Liao.</P>
      <P>Noting that a law-abiding citizenry is a vital factor in
enhancing a nation's competitiveness and that apart from family,
school is the social organization that most people are first exposed
to, Liao urged his student audience to prepare themselves for the
more complicated adult social life by learning how to meet their
responsibilities while enjoying their schooldays.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TIME ISN'T RIPE FOR SEF TO SET UP CROSS-STRAIT FORUM: MAC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  21  (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Chang King-yuh, chairman of Taipei's
cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC), said on Friday that
although setting up a cross-strait forum under the framework of the
Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) would not likely result in
structural "overlap," the time isn't ripe for carrying out that idea.</P>
      <P>Chang's remark was in response to a report that the Beijing-based
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) has set up
an organization named the Cross-Strait Relationship Research Center
and that it hopes the SEF will establish a corresponding cross-strait
forum in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>ARATS set up the center to serve as another channel for
consultations between the two sides, according to the report. It will
be chaired by Tang Shubei, with Mu Huaigo as its deputy-chief and
Xing Kuishan, who is currently the research bureau director of the
Central Office for Taiwan Affairs, as an advisor.</P>
      <P>Beijing hopes the SEF will set up a corresponding organization so
that the new channel can serve as a more effective means for
reflecting the views held by both sides and thus be conducive to
greater interaction between Taipei and Beijing, according to the
report.</P>
      <P>Chang told reporters that according to the consensus reached at
the National Development Conference at the end of 1996, there was a
suggestion of setting up a non-official cross-strait forum; however,
he added, the time for the implementation of that idea is not ripe
yet.</P>

necessarily result in "overlap," its status and function would hinge

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN-US WTO AGREEMENT ON INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTS (I)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Feb. 21 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>At their 17th and final round of talks
on Taiwan's terms for entry into the World Trade Organization (TWO),
Taiwan and the United Stated finally reached agreement on terms for
Taiwan's entry into the world trade regulatory body. Following are
details of part of agreement on industrial products:</P>
      <P>1. Industrial Tariffs</P>
      <P>Taiwan has committed to reducing its average tariff for
industrial products from 6.5 percent to 4.9 percent by year 2002 and
to further reduce it to 4.7 percent by 2004.</P>
      <P>Taiwan will participate in all Uruguay Round (UR) zero-for-zero
sectoral initiatives. These initiatives include chemical
harmonization and the elimination of tariffs on medical equipment,
furniture, toys, steel, paper, construction equipment, agricultural
equipment, civil aircraft and distilled spirits. Apart from a few
categories where Taiwan will eliminate duties in 2004, Taiwan has
offered to completely eliminate duties in these sectors by 2002.
Taiwan is also participating in the zero-for-zero Information
Technology Agreement, and is an active participant in ITA II.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has agreed to actively support all of the APEC sectoral
initiatives and, when an agreement is reached in APEC on the sectoral
initiatives, Taiwan will include it in its WTO schedule. The
immediate APEC initiatives include energy, equipment and services,
environmental goods and services, forest products, toys, chemicals,
medical equipment, fish and fish products, gems and jewelry and the
telecommunications mutual recognition agreements.</P>
      <P>2. Motor Vehicles</P>
      <P>The tariff on motor vehicle imports will be reduced from 30
percent to 20 percent over a reasonable period. In addition, Taiwan
will replace its current system of three commodity tax levels based
on engine displacement with a two-level system. At 2000cc and below,
the tax remains at 25 percent. Vehicles at 2001cc and above, however,
will be taxed at 35 percent upon accession, and further lowered to 30
percent five years after accession.</P>
      <P>Currently, Taiwan taxes passenger cars at 2000cc and below at 25
percent, cars between 2001cc and 3600 at 35 percent, and the 3600cc
and above category at 60 percent.</P>
      <P>A tariff-rate quota (TRQ) will be in place for ten years after
accession. The quota that the United States enjoys will be double the
amount of their highest level of imports between 1990 and 1993.
Tariffs on motor vehicles outside the quota will be phased down from
60 percent to 20 percent over the ten-year TRQ period after which the
TRQ will be entirely eliminated.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan market for motor vehicles is expected to be
approximately 500,000 units in 1998. The US quota allocation will be
approximately 160,000 vehicles on accession, or potentially 32
percent of the market, and will grow by 20 percent in each of the
following ten years.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has agreed to eliminate the privilege that locally made
engines, bodies, and chassis can each offset a 3 percent commodity
tax from January 1, 2001.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has also agreed to eliminate the local content
requirements of Taiwan-made motor vehicles, a regulation which runs
counter to WTO rules, immediately upon accession. Before being
admitted to the WTO, Taiwan will reduce the local content rate of
Taiwan-made motor vehicles from 50 percent to 40 percent after
January 1, 1999.

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT LEE REAFFIRMS COMMITMENT TO CROSS-STRAIT TALKS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Feb.  21  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Lee Teng-hui on Saturday
reaffirmed the necessity of resuming dialogue across the Taiwan
Strait, saying consultations can help foster mutual trust, avoid
misunderstanding, reduce the risk of misjudgments and maintain peace
in the region.</P>
      <P>Lee made the remarks while meeting with a group of foreign
scholars and experts here to attend a seminar on mainland China's
political and economic developments in the wake of the 15th National
Congress of the Chinese Communist Party.</P>
      <P>Lee refuted speculation in some quarters that Taiwan does not
really want to resume talks with the mainland.</P>
      <P>"Such speculation is erroneous," the president asserted, adding
that Taiwan is more than willing to resume dialogue with the mainland
because contacts and consultations can increase mutual understanding,
forge rapprochement, and, more importantly, reduce misunderstanding
and misjudgments.</P>
      <P>Lee said he has consistently attached great importance to
cross-strait relations, adding that during his tenure, the Republic
of China government has declared the termination of the Period of
National Mobilization for Suppression of the Communist Rebellion and
abolished the Temporary Provisions Effective During the Period of
Communist Rebellion.</P>
      <P>"These moves were aimed at replacing previous cross-strait
military confrontation with peaceful exchanges and negotiations," Lee
explained, adding that maintaining cross-strait peace and
safeguarding physical safety and property rights of the general
public have been his top concern.</P>
      <P>Noting that mainland China's situation has a critical bearing on
stability across the Taiwan Strait and even the entire Asia-Pacific
region, Lee said he earnestly hopes that other countries, while
engaging in trade and economic exchanges with the mainland, can
simultaneously help push for its peaceful evolution in order to
sustain regional peace, stability and prosperity.</P>
      <P>Lee further said he will be delighted to see mainland China's
peaceful evolution proceed in a gradual manner instead of as a result
of radical changes because the country encompasses such a large area.
"Gradual changes will be more suitable than a radical revolution," he
noted.</P>
      <P>Lee also expressed his regret over Beijing's failure to make any
formal response to Taiwan's calls for resumption of bilateral
dialogue since mid-1995.</P>
      <P>Since Beijing unilaterally suspended institutionalized
cross-strait consultations in June 1995, Lee said he and other senior
ROC officials have repeatedly urged the mainland to resume such
contacts. "Regrettably, mainland China has so far failed to make any
formal written reply to our appeal."</P>
      <P>Touching on the establishment of a new world order, Lee said the
ROC is an independent sovereign state with an 87-year history. "We
have never disappeared from the international community," Lee noted,
adding that the ROC maintains unofficial ties with more than 140
countries around the world, in addition to maintaining formal
diplomatic relations with some 30 countries.</P>
      <P>For its own survival and development, Lee said, the ROC must step
boldly and firmly into the world arena in a pragmatic manner. "More
importantly, we have the resources to pay back the world community
for what it has given to us in the process of our development."</P>
      <P>As an East Asian country, Lee said, the ROC cannot sit idly by
and adopt a hands-off policy while its Southeast Asian neighbors are
beset by financial woes. "We'll share our experience and expertise
with those battered Southeast Asian countries and help them to
weather their current difficulties."</P>

    <HEADLINE>US WELCOMES WTO AGREEMENT WITH TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington, Feb. 20 (CNA)
(By Jay Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>US government officials responsible for
trade, commerce and agriculture have welcomed an agreement reached on
Friday aimed at further opening Taiwan's market to US products.</P>
      <P>US Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky said the
comprehensive agreement will "dramatically open Taiwan's market" to
US agricultural products, services and industrial goods.</P>
      <P>"US farmers will see new markets for pork, chicken and other meat
products that have never been open to any foreign imports," she said.
"US exporters of industrial products will achieve levels of market
access comparable to those available in other developed countries.
And Taiwan will provide broad access to a full range of services,
including financial and telecommunications services."</P>
      <P>Commenting on the agreement initialed in Washington, Commerce
Secretary William M. Daley said he is "particularly pleased that this
agreement addresses issues of key concern to America's export
industries, from autos to major infrastructure projects."</P>
      <P>Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman called the accord "a
ground-breaking agreement for American agriculture."</P>
      <P>Glickman said: "Taiwan, which is already one of our largest
export markets, has agreed to provide new access for US poultry and
pork and beef variety meats."</P>
      <P>The agreement came as negotiators from the two countries
concluded their 17th round of talks in five years over terms for
Taiwan's accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO). With the
conclusion of this agreement, only two of the 26 WTO members with
which Taiwan has held bilateral talks require further consultations.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is currently the seventh-largest export market for US
products and imported about US$2.6 billion-worth of US farm goods in
1996/97, although it has maintained a ban on livestock and rice
imports.</P>

(By Wu Pin-chiang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The newly appointed chief of Indonesia's
Army Strategic Reserve Command, Lt. Gen. Prabowo Subianto, expressed
concern on Friday over the continuing social unrest, as many areas
remained tense.</P>
      <P>No fresh riots were reported that day, but the
situations in the Southeast Sulawesi capital of Kendari and the North
Sumatra town of Rantau Prapat, the scene of major unrest on Thursday,
were tense, officials said.</P>
      <P>Bus drivers in several cities in Java remained on strike to
emphasize their demands that the government should lower prices of
auto parts and increase bus fares in line with the price hikes in the
Southeast Asian country which has been hard-hit by the financial
crisis sweeping the region.</P>
      <P>Prabowo said he was aware that the riots, which have mostly
targeted properties owned by ethnic Chinese entrepreneurs, have
endangered the nation's unity.</P>
      <P>Prabowo, a son-in-law of President Suharto, reiterated his stance
that the army remains committed to safeguarding security across the
country.</P>
      <P>"We will do our best to ensure the safety of all citizens
regardless of their ethnic and religious backgrounds. I think the
Armed Forces (ABRI) will not fail the people," Prabowo was quoted by
the Jakarta Post as saying.</P>
      <P>Thousands of people enraged by soaring prices of essential
commodities have run amok in several cities in Java, Sumatra and
Sulawesi this week.</P>
      <P>The angry mobs smashed shops and property owned by ethnic Chinese
traders, who dominate Indonesia's retail sector.</P>
      <P>In Rantau Prapat, about 400 km southeast of Medan, the
authorities said 10 people were caught looting stores and houses on
Wednesday and Thursday were still being questioned.</P>
      <P>Kendari was calm but tense after the military threatened to carry
out shoot-on-sight orders if protests turned violent.</P>
      <P>In Yogyakarta, hundreds of students from 10 universities held
three different demonstrations, demanding the government guarantee
adequate supplies of basic commodities at affordable prices.</P>
      <P>The rally was part of a two-day demonstration by students calling
themselves the Association of Yogyakarta Youth Struggle.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, food shortages are threatening thousands of people in
several subdistricts in Central Sulawesi, North Maluku and East
Kalimantan as the economic situation continues to deteriorate, media
reports said on Friday.</P>
      <P>At the same time, legal aid and pro-democracy groups said they
have recorded 14 abductions, 13 shootings and 921 arrests across
Indonesia in the past few weeks.</P>
      <P>"According to our data, 14 people were kidnapped," said a joint
statement issued by the Indonesian Legal Aid Foundation, the
Independent Committee on Election Monitoring and the Institute for
Study and People's Advocacy.</P>
      <P>Troops and police have shot 13 people during the recent spate of
riots in a dozen cities and towns across the country that have
occurred in protest against the soaring prices, said the statement.</P>
      <P>The shots, fired during separate incidents in the Central Java
district of Brebes and West Java towns of Cirebon and Bekasi, left
three dead and ten injured, it added.</P>
      <P>However, the figure does not include two other people who died
from gunshot wounds during a riot on the eastern island of Lombok.
The groups recorded that 921 people were arrested by police and
troops during the riots and demonstrations in at least 23 cities and
towns.</P>
      <P>Army Chief Gen. Soebagio on Thursday warned that severe action
would be taken against demonstrators and marchers who could trigger
disturbances and violence ahead of and during the upcoming
presidential and vice presidential elections.</P>
      <P>Jakarta Military Commander Maj. Gen. Sjafrie Sjamsoedin had
earlier banned demonstrations in the capital.</P>
      <P>East Java military authorities have threatened to shoot
demonstrators who spark rioting in the region.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC-US AGREEMENT ON MARKET OPENING DEEMED 'WIN-WIN OUTCOME'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington, Feb. 20 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The agreement signed Friday between the
Republic of China and the United States at the conclusion of their
bilateral negotiations over Taiwan's accession to the World Trade
Organization (WTO) has been termed by both countries' representatives
as a "win-win outcome" for the US and Taiwan economies.</P>
      <P>The comprehensive agreement, which opens Taiwan's market to US
agricultural products, services and industrial goods, was signed by
Stephen Chen, ROC representative to the United States, and Richard
Bush, chairman of the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT), at the end
of an 11-day round of negotiations between ROC and US officials on
Taiwan's accession to the WTO.</P>
      <P>Asked to comment on the outcome of the negotiations, Chen, who
heads the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office (TECRO)
in Washington, said the agreement is mutually beneficial and that it
represents "another big step" toward Taiwan's accession to the WTO.</P>
      <P>"We look forward to the days when we will conclude similar
bilateral negotiations with the European Union and Switzerland so
that we can join the World Trade Organization in the near future,"
Chen said, noting that the WTO is extremely important to Taiwan's
existence and development.</P>
      <P>In a statement issued after the signing ceremony, Bush termed the
agreement "a great achievement." He said the comprehensive pact is
"probably the most important agreement" signed between AIT and TECRO
-- formerly known as the Coordination Council for North American
Affairs -- since their establishment 19 years ago.</P>
      <P>"It signifies that the deep and mutually beneficial relationship
between the people of the United States and the people on Taiwan is
strong and growing," Bush said.</P>
      <P>In his view, the agreement is good for both sides because US
companies, exporters and farmers will have new opportunities in
Taiwan, the 14th largest economy in the world. On the other hand,
consumers in Taiwan will benefit as tariffs on imported goods decline
over the next few years.</P>
      <P>He expressed confidence that as Taiwan companies are exposed more
to global economic forces, they will become even more competitive and
successful than they already are.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and the United States conducted 17 rounds of bilateral
negotiations on Taiwan's accession to the WTO over the past five
years. The latest round of negotiations in Washington began on Feb.
9. The ROC delegation was headed by Economics Minister Wang Chih-kang

    <HEADLINE>EU TO HOLD WTO TALKS WITH TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Brussels,  Feb.  20  (CNA)
(By P. C. Tang and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The 15-member European Union (EU)
will hold a new round of talks with Taiwan on the terms for
the island's entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO).</P>
      <P>EU officials in charge of WTO affairs already left for
Taipei in preparation for the Feb. 23-25 trade consultations with
their Taiwan counterparts, EU sources said on Friday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan officials stationed in Brussels said there are not major
disputes between Taiwan and the EU over the island's WTO entry
terms. The unsolved issues are mainly related to Taiwan's tariff
reduction plan for compact car imports and the reform of its
decades-old wine and tobacco monopoly system.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has promised to replace its wine and tobacco monopoly
system with a new taxation system following its accession to the
Geneva-based world trade regulatory body. "Only some technical
details in this regard need further discussion," said an official
with Taiwan's representative office here.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, the official said, the EU may demanded Taiwan to
further lower its tariff rates for compact car imports.</P>
      <P>EU officials once agreed to Taiwan's proposal to lower its
tariff rate for compact cars to 25 percent from the current 30
percent over a resonable period of time. However, the EU now intends
to push Taiwan to make larger tariff cuts and lower the rate to

    <HEADLINE>WTO ACCORD PANICS TAIWAN HOG FARMERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  21 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan hog farmers have panicked over the
results of the latest US-Taiwan bilateral trade consultations on
terms for Taiwan's accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO),
in which Taipei agreed to open the island's pork market to US exports
to the tune of 12,500 tons of pork products immediately upon
accession.</P>
      <P>According to an estimate by Fang Ching-chuan, secretary-general
of the Taiwan Hog Raisers Association, the US imports will cause
locals to sacrifice 1 million head of swine worth NT$15 billion
(US$455 million) in the first year of the accession.</P>
      <P>Although Taipei officials have expressed satisfaction that the
gradually enlargement of the annual quota on US pork products will
allow local hog farmers a period of "adjustment," Fang said that the
"down payment" that Taiwan has promised to make in exchange for the
quota system is too high.</P>
      <P>In addition, Taipei's promise to fully open Taiwan's meat markets
by the year 2005 is "rubbing salt into the wound" of the island's hog
farmers, he said, noting that many of them have barely recovered from
the catastrophic damage that a foot-and-mouth disease epidemic had on
the hog population islandwide.</P>
      <P>Last week, some 5,000 angry hog farmers took to the streets of
Taipei to protest the market liberalization demand from the US side,
pelting Washington's de facto embassy here with eggs and pig manure.</P>
      <P>Fang, on behalf of the island's hog farmers and pork producers,
made an eight-point appeal to the government, asking the state-run
Taiwan Sugar Corp. to forsake its hog raising business once and for
all, demanding the extension of salvation loans to farms that were
ravaged by the foot-and-mouth disease outbreak and calling for
government measures to digest stocks of frozen pork products.</P>
      <P>The hog farmers also demanded a government-facilitated fund to be
established to aid the development of domestic hog farming and help
farmers who become victims of the foreign imports.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taiwan's top agricultural official urged the farmers
to throw their support behind the government's policy, saying WTO
membership will eventually help restructure Taiwan's agricultural and
industrial sectors and raise the island's international
competitiveness.</P>
      <P>Peng Tzuo-kuei, chairman of the cabinet-level Council of
Agriculture, said he is pleased that Taipei finally concluded its WTO
talks with the United States. The negotiations ended on Feb. 20 in
Washington, D.C. after 17 rounds of talks over the last five years.</P>
      <P>Peng said seeking accession to the WTO has been Taipei's
established policy, and that during the last round of talks both
sides demonstrated commendable sincerity and flexibility.</P>
      <P>While Taipei agreed to make a number of concessions for the WTO
accession, the new foreign imports will not necessarily threaten the
survival of the Taiwan's agricultural sector, Peng said, citing the
fact that many Taiwan agricultural products and their production
technologies can competitively match the standards of
industrially-advanced countries.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LEE KUAN YEW ASKS EU TO HELP ASIA TO SPEEDIER RECOVERY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  Feb.  21 (CNA)
(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Singapore Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew
on Friday called on the European Union (EU) to play a more active
role in helping Asia to a speedier recovery from its economic ills.</P>
      <P>He made the call in a keynote speech to the first Europe-Asia
Forum currently being held in Singapore.</P>
      <P>He said Europe and the United States should support Japan in its
efforts to help countries in the region out of the present crisis.</P>
      <P>Europe, he pointed out, has missed earlier opportunities to show
concern for Indonesia and Thailand.</P>
      <P>It came late in Korea with direct contributions to the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) package, and did not give directly
to Thailand and Indonesia except through its IMF membership.</P>
      <P>Apart from German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's recent expression of
support for Indonesia's President Suharto, the perception in Asia is
that the EU "has been passive" in this crisis of confidence, he said.</P>
      <P>"If it is to play a global role, the EU must be more active in
helping to restore confidence in Asia's currencies and financial
markets," he stressed.</P>
      <P>As European banks exposed to Asia have potential losses of well
over US$15 billion, it is in their interest to help contain a crisis
which they, like the other industrialized nations, have abetted with
some careless investments and loans, he said.</P>
      <P>The two-day forum brings together more than 60 European and Asian
political, business and opinion leaders for dialogue on the theme,
"Two Views, One Vision."</P>
      <P>In his speech, Lee gave a detailed analysis of the currency
turmoil's origins. He noted that some East Asian economies, which
grew 7 to 9 percent a year for 15 years, had reached full capacity by
the early 1990s, so new investments went into doubtful projects.</P>
      <P>Yet, no international body "raised the red flag," with the World
Bank and global ratings agency Fitch IBCA now admitting they were too
optimistic on the region.</P>
      <P>Amid the euphoria, cheap and easy credit led to asset bubbles and
overbuilt property markets. Banks gave loans for personal and
political connections. Investors went in recklessly.</P>
      <P>Lenders were aware, but accepted it as a way of business. Some
saw politically connected business partners as implicit government
guarantees for loans.</P>
      <P>In 1996, an export slowdown and widening current account deficits
in these countries spooked financial markets. "What had begun as a
classic market mania as funds flowed exuberantly into East Asia to
enjoy higher rates of return, became a classic market panic as
foreign investors stampeded towards the door to get out with their
money," he noted.</P>
      <P>Turning to how East Asian governments could respond, Lee said
they should:</P>
      <P>-- Reject cronyism and have a professional civil service,
effective central bank, and sound banks and companies, to restore
confidence.</P>
      <P>Policies should be in accordance with benchmark IMF programs, to
convince their people and global fund managers that their economies
are on the mend. "In spite of criticism, there is no viable
alternative to the IMF for now."</P>
      <P>ASEAN countries should also endorse the OECD convention of last
December to make receiving bribes a criminal act.</P>
      <P>-- Improve information flow and disclosure, and be more
transparent -- the best way to avoid market reactions to rumors. With
such data, foreign investors can distinguish between East Asian
economies and foresee potential problems.</P>
      <P>-- Continue to open up their economies, including sectors
previously closed, and encourage capital inflow.</P>
      <P>Summing up at the end of the day, Prof. Tommy Koh, executive
director of the Asia-Europe Foundation, one of the sponsors of the
forum, said that the consensus that emerged from the discussion was
that "Asian economies will get back on track in two to four years,"
and commitment was expressed by both Europe and Asia to help each
other continue to globalize.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia and New Zealand are working to
form a united force in support of the US-led war against Iraq in case
last-ditch efforts by UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan fail to
persuade Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to comply with the UN
Security Council resolutions to dismantle Iraqi chemical and
biological weapons.</P>
      <P>In a meeting in Sydney Friday, Australian Prime Minister John
Howard and his New Zealand counterpart, Jenny Shipley, discussed the
joint force.</P>
      <P>Both countries have dispatched special forces troops to the Gulf.
Australia has sent 190 personnel, including 110 Special Air Service
(SAS) troops, while New Zealand has sent 20 SAS soldiers and 40 air
force personnel.</P>
      <P>In a joint press conference, Howard and Shipley said arrangements
were being discussed to form the units into an Australian-New Zealand
(ANZAC) force.</P>
      <P>"The goal would be for the closest possible cooperation between
the two countries in the ANZAC tradition," Howard said.</P>
      <P>"The practicalities of that, of course, are things that need to
be fully worked out and resolved by ourselves and in discussion with
the United States," he added.</P>
      <P>Shipley said they would know within several days if the
arrangement would be possible.</P>
      <P>"While New Zealand is a small country, it is one that has always
sought to do its share, and the recent decision to deploy troops to
Iraq is something that has been important to New Zealand," she said.</P>
      <P>"It is our hope that we will be able to work as an ANZAC force.
New Zealanders and Australians have had a great history of success,"
she added.</P>
      <P>Australian and New Zealand troops used to cooperate closely on

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN TO COMPLETELY OPEN TOBACCO, LIQUOR MARKETS IN THREE YEARS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  21 (CNA)
(By Lin Wen-fen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan will phase out its monopoly system
on tobacco and liquor and open its market completely to foreign
tobacco and liquor in three years, according to a high-ranking
financial official.</P>
      <P>Vice Finance Minister Wu Chai-shen, who returned on Saturday
morning from the Taiwan-US talks on terms for Taiwan's entry into the
World Trade Organization, said that according to the agreement
reached with US officials, three years after Taiwan's monopoly system
on tobacco and liquor is lifted -- an action expected this year --
the island's tobacco and liquor markets will be totally liberalized.</P>
      <P>Four years after the monopoly system is dismantled and replaced
with a taxation system, the production of liquor will be open to
local and foreign investors, Wu noted, adding that as tobacco is
hazardous to human health, the government has no plans to open the
manufacture of tobacco products to the private sector.</P>
      <P>Wu said that the Legislative Yuan is expected to pass the law
governing the taxation of tobacco and liquor and another law
governing the production and sale of those products in this session,
providing a legal framework for the taxation system to replace the
monopoly on tobacco and liquor.</P>
      <P>On tobacco or liquor smuggled into Taiwan and then seized, Wu
said that the US officials have agreed that when Taiwan adopts the
taxation system, confiscated tobacco or liquor won't have to be
destroyed but can be disposed of in other ways, including auctioning,
donation or resale.</P>
      <P>The taxation of rice wine was a key issue in the trade talks.
According to Wu, the US side, which had demanded that the rice wine
be taxed the same as distilled spirits, has agreed to give it a
five-year adjustment period. This means that the taxation for rice
wine will be raised gradually over five years once the new system is
launched. Beginning in the sixth year, rice wine will be taxed the
same as distilled spirits.</P>
      <P>Currently the taxation for rice wine is NT$22 (US$0.67) per
liter, compared with NT$170 per liter for distilled spirits.</P>
      <P>Wu said that in the agreement, Taiwan has agreed to completely
eliminate tariffs on both brown and white spirits (e.g. bourbon,
whiskey, gin and vodka) by 2000. Tariffs on beer will be completely
eliminated by 2005. Tariffs on wine will go down to 10 percent by
2002.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PM SIEW SATISFIED WITH WTO AGREEMENT WITH US</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  21  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Vincent Siew said on Saturday he
is satisfied with the outcome of negotiations with the United States
over terms for Taiwan's entry into the World Trade Organization
(WTO).</P>
      <P>"Even though Taiwan has made concessions in consultative process,
the outcome complies with our economic liberalization policy," Siew
noted, adding that the government has drawn up measures to minimize
the possible adverse impact on domestic agriculture or industries of
the newly signed Taiwan-US WTO agreement.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and American negotiators finally came to terms on all the
thorny WTO-related issues on Friday after 17 rounds of intensive
talks spanning more than five years, with Taiwan agreeing to lower
trade barriers and offer greater market access to US agricultural
products, services and industrial goods.</P>
      <P>According to the agreement initialed on Friday in Washington,
D.C., Taiwan agreed to imports of limited quantities of pork,
chicken meat and intestines from the US before its WTO entry.
Taiwan also made concessions on some other trade fields in exchange
for US support for its WTO bid.</P>
      <P>Siew said accession to the WTO will benefit Taiwan's overall
economic development. "We fully understand that market-opening
measures will affect certain industries, particularly the
agricultural sector. We'll adopt effective measures to protect
rights and interests of local farmers," he added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Council of Agriculture (COA) Chairman Peng Tzuo-kuei
said the government has managed to stand firm on its stance in
negotiating with the US. Noting that negotiation is a given-and-take
process, Peng said even though Taiwan made some concessions, it has
managed to get some favorable terms to protect its farmers.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has agreed to offer market access to 5,000 tons of pork
cuts, 10,000 tons of chicken meat and 7,500 tons of intestines from
the US. "This doesn't mean that foreign pork will be able to
successfully make inroads into our market," Peng said, adding that
local farmers should have confidence in the competitiveness of
locally produced pork.</P>
      <P>With the conclusion of WTO talks with the US, Taiwan will now
focus on negotiations with the 15-member European Union (EU) and
Switzerland, the only two trade partners that have yet to finalize
bilateral talks with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs said on Saturday that Taiwan
expects to conclude bilateral WTO talks with the EU and Switzerland
before the end of March.</P>
      <P>If all goes smoothly, the ministry said, Taiwan will begin
multilateral talks with the WTO working party in charge of Taiwan's
membership application in Geneva in April.</P>
      <P>"The conclusion of WTO talks with the US marks a big step
forward toward our goal to join the important world trade regulatory
body," government spokesman Chen Chien-jen, adding the agreement
with the US will help speed up Taiwan's WTO accession.</P>
      <P>Twenty-six WTO contracting parties expressed intentions to hold
bilateral talks with Taiwan. To date, 24 of them have finalized such
talks with Taiwan, and 18 of them have signed agreements on entry
terms. Six other members -- Hungary, Argentina, Thailand, Hong Kong,
Mexico and Canada -- have yet to ink formal accords. The pact with
the US will take effect on March 10.</P>
      <P>Reports from Washington quoted US Trade Representative Charlene
Barshefsky as saying that the US has consistently handled Taiwan's
WTO application separately from mainland China's WTO bid. The US has
no intention to stimilate or provoke Beijing by concluding talks
with Taipei ahead of its negotiations with Bejing, she added.
Washington's WTO talks with Beijing are still stalled by some
sensitive trade issues.</P>
      <P>Beijing applied for joining the WTO's predecessor, the General
Agreement on Trade and Tariffs (GATT), in 1986, while Taiwan filed
its application in 1990. The WTO superceded the GATT in January
1995. Both Taiwan and mainland China are now WTO observers.</P>

    <DATELINE>Washington,  Feb.  21  (CNA)
(By Herman Pan &amp; Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The total value of US agricultural
products purchased by Taiwan in 1997 dropped 12 percent from the
year-earlier level, marking the first decline in the trade in five
years, according to statistics from the US Department of Agriculture
(DOA).</P>
      <P>The statistics show that Taiwan bought US$2.69 billion worth of
American agricultural products last year, down US$352 million in
comparison with the 1996 volume.</P>
      <P>However, in terms of total value, Taiwan remained Washington's
fifth largest overseas agricultural market, following Japan, Canada,
Mexico and South Korea, the department said.</P>
      <P>By category, the tallies showed, the main farm items that Taiwan
purchased from American producers last year were cereal grain,
soybean, leather, fresh fruit and wheat. The United States is the
island's largest trade partner.</P>
      <P>In 1997, the United States sold US$698 million worth of cereal
grain to Taiwan, down sharply by 28.8 percent from the previous year,
while US$1.62 billion worth of American wheat was exported to the
island, down 25.3 percent. The US$6.49 billion of soybean exports to
Taiwan represented a 16.4 percent fall, according to the DOA
statistics.</P>
      <P>The figures also indicated that Taiwan's protection of its rice
market resulted in only a small amount of US-produced rice, valued at
US$485,000, being exported to the island last year. Nevertheless,
that represented a 164 percent jump from the year-earlier level.</P>
      <P>American exports of rice to Taiwan, where the commodity is a
staple in the diet of most residents, are expected to see a
significant rise after Taipei promised on Friday to fully open its
rice market to US producers as part of a deal to gain World Trade
Organization membership.</P>
      <P>According to the DOA, Washington exported a total of US$57.137
billion worth of farm products last year, down 5.3 percent from a
year ago. Japan was the largest buyer of American agricultural goods,
followed in order by Canada, Mexico, South Korea, Taiwan, Holland,
Hong Kong, mainland China, Germany and Britain, the department said.</P>

      <P>Huang and Wu were the leaders of an ROC delegation here to attend
the elevation ceremony of Kaohsiung Archbishop Shan and 21 other
prelates from around the world. The ceremony was held earlier
Saturday at St. Peter's Square.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a news conference after the ceremony, Shan thanked
Pope John Paul II for his concern for the Chinese people and the
development of the Catholic Church in Taiwan and mainland China. He
vowed to engage in welfare activities to assist other countries and
serve as a bridge in communication with the Catholic Church in the
mainland, saying that the mission of the Catholic Church is to serve
society, humanity and help carry out spiritual reforms.</P>
      <P>The Catholic Church played an important role in the fields of
education, medical care and assisting the poor in the early days
after its founding in Taiwan, while its mission nowadays focuses on
taking care of the elderly and mentally retarded children and setting
up halfway homes for women, Shan pointed out.</P>
      <P>The cardinal said that the Taiwan Catholic Church not only cares
for the people of Taiwan but also is very willing to assist poor
people in other countries, adding that it has a worked out a
long-term program to carry out its international aid mission.</P>
      <P>Tai said the elevation of Shan, the only Asian among the 22
prelates named to the cardinalship on Saturday, will help boost peace
and justice in the world.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>-- Philippine President Fidel V. Ramos
Saturday sent his condolences, on behalf of the Filipino people, to
relatives of the victims in the crash of a China Airlines (CAL) A-300
jetliner last Monday.</P>
      <P>The disaster killed all 196 passengers and crew members onboard
and six other persons on the ground.</P>
      <P>At the same time, Ramos reiterated his call for a thorough
investigation of the recent Cebu Pacific Flight 387 crash which, he
said, has become more urgent following the Taiwan air accident.</P>
      <P>"The investigation to pinpoint responsibility should likewise be
carried out with similar thoroughness for the sake of aviation safety
by way of immediate corrective, punitive and preventive actions
whenever necessary," Ramos said.</P>
      <P>In a letter of condolences to Republic of China President Lee
Teng-hui, the Philippine president said: "The Filipino nation, which
still mourns the tragic loss of 104 previous lives in the crash of
the ill-fated Cebu Pacific Flight 387 in Northern Mindanao (on Feb.
2, 1998), is too well aware of the pain and anguish being felt by
your people.</P>
      <P>"Mrs. Ramos and I join you and your people in praying that the
families and loved ones of the victims be given the strength and
courage to recover from the tragedy," he added.</P>
      <P>The CAL jetliner was returning from the Indonesian resort of Bali
when it slammed into a row of houses near Taipei's international
airport and burst into flames.</P>
      <P>Among those who perished in the crash were Taiwan's central bank
governor and other finance officials returning from a conference in
Bali.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN TO BENEFIT GREATLY FROM WTO MEMBERSHIP: WANG</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  22  (CNA)
(By Bear Lee)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's long-awaited membership in the
World Trade Organization (WTO) is expected to bring multifaceted
benefits to the island's economy, Minister of Economic Affairs Wang
Chih-kang said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan concluded bilateral talks with the United States on terms
for its entry into the WTO in Washington on Friday, marking a great
step forward in its bid for membership in the world trade regulatory
body.</P>
      <P>Wang, Taiwan's chief negotiator in the talks, said that Taiwan's
gross domestic product will increase by US$33 billion after it joins
the WTO.</P>
      <P>The WTO membership will also bring Taiwan an additional US$23.7
billion in domestic consumption, US$25.9 billion in exports, US$26.3
billion in imports and US$3.9 billion in investment, along with
376,000 more job opportunities, he said.</P>
      <P>Besides, the economics minister said, membership will entitle
Taiwan to most-favored-nation status and treatment as a national
entity under the global trade system, as well as ensure the right to
participate in the framing of international trade laws and to seek
WTO arbitration in trade disputes with other nations.</P>
      <P>Wang described the just-concluded talks with the United States as
the most difficult in the five-year, 17-round negotiation process.</P>
      <P>He said that while the US side had "nothing to lose" and had
increased its demands every time upon returning to the negotiating
table, Taiwan could do nothing but adopt a strategy of "giving the
less, the better."</P>
      <P>Wang echoed the comment by Richard Bush, chairman and managing
director of the American Institute in Taiwan, who said the Washington
talks have created a "win-win" situation for both sides as each
gained what it wanted.</P>
      <P>But Council of Agriculture Vice Chairman Lin Shiang-nung said
that WTO membership will also inevitably bring certain negative
impacts on the island's farm sector and that the government will take
necessary relief measures for those affected.</P>
      <P>Taiwan applied to join the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
(GATT), the predecessor of the WTO, in 1990 under the name "Customs
Territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu," and was granted
observer status in that body the following year.</P>
      <P>With the conclusion of talks with the United States, Taiwan has
completed its negotiations with 24 of the 26 WTO contracting parties
who have expressed concerns over Taiwan's trade regime, and has
signed pacts with 17 of them.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is expected to gain entry into the WTO in May, after
completing talks with the European Union later this month and with
Switzerland in the near future.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 22 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>US Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky
has accepted an invitation from Economics Minister Wang Chih-kang of
the Republic of China to visit Taiwan, Chen Ruey-long, chief of the
Board of Foreign Trade, revealed here Sunday.</P>
      <P>Chen quoted Barshefsky as saying she believes high-level official
exchanges between Taipei and Washington can help improve links
between the two countries and, accordingly, she plans to travel to
Taiwan at Wang's invitation.</P>
      <P>Wang and Barshefsky were the chief negotiators for their
respective governments in bilateral talks on Taiwan's bid for World
Trade Organization (WTO) membership. The negotiations ended in what
was called a "win-win" situation on Friday when the two sides forged
an agreement after 17 rounds of marathon sessions spanning several
years.</P>
      <P>The United States has been Taiwan's largest trade partner. After
winning Washington's agreement, the island sees no more major
obstacles to its joining the world trade regulatory body later this
year.</P>
      <P>Chen pointed out that Barshefsky had expressed the observation
that Taipei-Washington trade relations always seem to show signs of
improvement following her meetings with Wang and in the aftermath of
each round of discussions on the WTO issue.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, she hopes the two countries can continue to follow
the pattern of such exchanges in order to enhance mutual ties, Chen
noted.</P>
      <P>When Washington switched diplomatic recognition from Taipei to
Beijing in 1979, all ministerial-level contacts between Taiwan and
the United States came to a halt. Although vigorous trade activity
between the two sides has continued, only one senior US trade
official has come to Taiwan since formal ties were severed.</P>
      <P>Former US Trade Representative Carla Hills toured the island in
1992 in a private capacity, marking a significant step forward in
Taiwan-US relations at the time. Such progress is expected to advance
once again if Barshefsky goes ahead with her stated intention to

    <HEADLINE>ASIAN CRISIS HITS US AND JAPANESE TRADE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Geneva, Feb. 21 (CNA)
(By Maurus Young)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>United States and Japanese trade statistics
have provided further indications of the widening shockwave from
Asia's economic crisis.</P>
      <P>Japan's exports to the rest of Asia plunged in January, and the
country recorded its first trade deficit with the region in eight
years. In the United States, a higher-than-expected December trade
deficit pushed up the annual deficit to its highest level since 1988,
according to a report of the Financial Times.</P>
      <P>News of the drop in Japan's exports to Asia highlights the degree
to which the financial turmoil in the region is suppressing demand
and making Japanese goods less competitive in those markets.</P>
      <P>It also provides one of the first concrete signs of the degree to
which Southeast Asia's problems are threatening, on the eve of the
latest economic stimulus package, to hurt Japan's own economy.</P>
      <P>Analysts forecast the US trade deficit would worsen in 1998 as
imports increase from Asian countries that have devalued their
currencies. The US deficit increased 24.3 percent in December to
US$10.79 billion compared with forecasts of US$8.7 billion.</P>
      <P>That meant the annual deficit in goods and services last year was
US$113.75 billion, a 2.4 percent increase compared with 1996. The
biggest import losses were in manufactured goods -- totaling US$172.6
billion for the year. However, the impact was mitigated by the growth
in services, which turned in a record US$85.2 billion surplus.
Services exports reached US$254 billion for the year. Imports were
US$168.8 billion.</P>
      <P>Japan's sales to Asia were 9.4 percent lower in January, measured
on an annual basis -- the sharpest monthly drop recorded since 1996.</P>

    <HEADLINE>21ST CENTURY WILL STILL BELONG TO THE UNITED STATES, SAYS HURD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  Feb.  22  (CNA)
(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The 21st century will be the American
century, not the Asian century or the European century, former
British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd predicted Saturday.</P>
      <P>In an interview at the first Europe Asia Forum held here, he
said: "The United States will remain the only superpower in the world
in the next century. The United States is already far ahead in its
use of technology, and its general management of its economy, and
this will continue."</P>
      <P>It will continue to maintain its preeminent position in
technology, in economics and in security arrangements, he added.</P>
      <P>Asian powers, such as Japan and mainland China, will grow rapidly
in population and gross domestic product (GDP) output, but would not
be able to rival America's status, said Hurd, who was Britain's
foreign secretary from 1989 to 1995, according to a report in The
Straits Times on Sunday.</P>
      <P>In any case, mainland China is not an "evangelical" power trying
to spread its values to the world, and it is only the United States
that aspires to that role. Europe and Asia, on their part, must get
themselves organized and united to be "valid partners" with
Washington, he said, adding that this was his main message to the
forum.</P>
      <P>Hurd is one of more than 60 decision-makers who were
participating in the first Europe Asia Forum held in Singapore on
Feb. 20-21.</P>
      <P>Explaining his concept of "valid" partnership, he said this did
not mean Europe and Asia would be "satellites" of America.</P>
      <P>Rather, each region should get itself organized to present a
united voice with which the United States can engage. Citing European
responses to the Iraqi crisis, in which individual European countries
have adopted different stances, Hurd said Europe has not been able to
present itself as a "valid partner."</P>
      <P>Asked for his assessment of the Asian economic crisis, Hurd said
one of the positive outcomes was that it has sparked sharp interest
in Europe about Asia.</P>
      <P>While some people have put forward the "domino theory" that the
Southeast Asian financial crisis will drag down Hong Kong, Japan and
mainland China, he said this is unlikely to happen because the
economic fundamentals in Asia remain strong.</P>
      <P>The crisis in Asia rose in part from problems of perceptions.
This is one area the second Asia-Europe meeting, which will be held
in London in April, can correct, Hurd said.</P>
      <P>European governments can play a part in spreading the message to
their people that the Asian crisis will affect Europe, while telling
investors that fundamentals in Asia remain strong. Asian countries
like mainland China and Japan can use the meeting as a platform to
reinforce these arguments convincingly.</P>
      <P>On the expertise Europe can offer Asia, he said the European
institutions can help strengthen financial institutions in Asia.</P>
      <P>Strengthening systems of regulation and supervision, and making
use of sophisticated financial products, can all help reduce future
shocks to the financial system, Hurd said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SUPRAPARTY MAINLAND POLICY URGED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  22 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Local academics and mainland experts at a
seminar on Sunday urged the government and opposition political
parties to soon forge consensus on a "supraparty" mainland policy as
a common basis for future political negotiations with Beijing.</P>
      <P>J.K. Chang, director of the Department of Mainland Operations
under the ruling Kuomintang (KMT), said Premier Vincent Siew's recent
policy report at the Legislative Yuan reflected the government's
intention to adopt a more flexible and active policy in its dealings
with mainland China.</P>
      <P>According to Chang, Siew made reference to cross-strait
negotiations on 10 occasions during his report, without
differentiating between "technical" or "political" talks.</P>
      <P>Chang also alluded to remarks by Siew last week that "any topics
which are beneficial to the peaceful development on the two sides of
Taiwan Strait and the nation's democratization and unification can be
discussed step by step in cross-strait talks," saying that such
topics include a wide range of issues, including technical matters
such as fishery disputes and political themes such as the "one China"
issue.</P>
      <P>Dismissing a belief by the outside world that Siew's recent
remarks on cross-strait talks, which are seen as "more flexible than
before," have come in reaction to a widely praised mainland policy
seminar held by the main opposition Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP), Chang said there is no connection between the two
developments.</P>
      <P>The decision made by the DPP at the gathering to advocate a
cautious "go west" approach in economic exchanges with the mainland
has long been the KMT's set policy in cross-strait relations, he
noted, adding that the pro-independence DPP has moved a step closer
to the KMT position following the seminar in this regard.</P>
      <P>Both Y.C. Liu, a research fellow at Academia Sinica, and C.S.
Chao, international relations professor at National Chengchi
University, hailed the DPP's transparent and democratic manner in
forging consensus on its own mainland policy. But the most important
task for the DPP now is to gain wide support from the various
factions within the party as a way of working out a "suprafactional"
mainland policy, they pointed out.</P>
      <P>Liu also called on all political parties in Taiwan to set aside
their disputes on the issue as a first step toward forging a
supraparty mainland policy.</P>
      <P>P.C. Chen, economics professor at National Taiwan University,
however, was more reserved about cross-strait economic exchanges.</P>
      <P>Although many people are in favor of gradually enhancing ties
with the mainland on the economic front, he warned, history has
proved that the smaller part eventually will be swallowed up by the
larger part.</P>
      <P>Taiwan can neither be overly arrogant nor grant too many
concessions in cross-strait negotiations, and it should negotiate
with the mainland only after the Chinese Communists first show signs
of sincerity, he said, urging the government not to give way to
Beijing's threats.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SINGAPORE'S LEE EXPLAINS WHY ASIAN CRISIS SPREAD SO FAST</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  Feb.  22 (CNA)
(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Singapore Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew
said technology is moving so fast that people's emotional and
cultural makeup cannot keep up with the changes in the world, and
this is one underlying reasons why the Asian crisis spread so
quickly.</P>
      <P>Leaders in East Asia, for example, did not understand the speed
and power of the international financial market, and thus made some
decisions early on in the crisis which eroded investors' confidence
in the region, he said.</P>
      <P>European leaders could help by taking measures that would help
Asian leaders "get in tune" with the new realities, Lee said during a
20-minute dialogue with participants of the first Europe Asia Forum
in Singapore on Friday night, The Straits Times reported Sunday.</P>
      <P>The two-day forum for over 60 European and Asian politicians,
business executives, financiers and academics was organized by the
German BMW Foundation, the Singapore-based Asia-Europe Foundation
(ASEF) and the Institute of Policy Studies.</P>
      <P>Responding to a question from Luxembourg banker Edmond Israel,
who sits on the ASEF's board of governors, on what his greatest
concern was for Asia's future, Lee said: "My greatest concern is the
inability of the emotional and cultural makeup of a man to catch up
with the technological changes that have been brought upon us, and
are coming. There is a time lag and this creates a dangerous gap."</P>
      <P>So, for example, the lure of loans at low interest rates enticed
people to borrow cheap, and to borrow short-term for long-term
investments. But they forgot the power and speed at which money could
move out of stock and money markets.</P>
      <P>There was thus this time lag between developments of modern
systems and people's ability to understand their implications. This
created a big problem, he said.</P>
      <P>Making a similar point in response to another question on what,
how and how much Germany could do to help alleviate the Asian crisis,
Lee said that beyond financial contributions, European leaders such
as German Chancellor Helmut Kohl could play a part in helping Asian
leaders come to terms with the nature of today's financial markets.</P>
      <P>Because of the lack of understanding of the rapidity and
volatility of the financial markets, missteps were taken at the
beginning of the crisis, which eroded confidence in the region, he
said.</P>
      <P>Giving a frank assessment of the situation, Lee said: "What I
think has been the greatest lesson of the Asian crisis is that many
in the region did not understand, or did not realize, the nature of
today's financial markets. We are not in the 1960s, we're in the
1990s."</P>
      <P>He said it was not until the crisis broke and he started reading
market reports two, three times a day, that he understood "just how
swift, how comprehensive, how thorough, every move that the
government makes during the crisis is analyzed, assessed," with the
consequences spelt out and offered to customers at the touch of a
button.</P>
      <P>"So whether it's Bangkok, Manila, Kuala Lumpur, Singapore,
Jakarta or Seoul, every move that the government makes or does not
make, has been analyzed, by Saloman Brothers, or ABN-AMRO -- two,
three pages of careful analysis, disseminated, and influencing
opinion in London, New York, Frankfurt, Paris, Tokyo.</P>
      <P>"It is necessary to get people updated on these things. That's
part of the job of leaders in the developed world."</P>
      <P>Whether people like it or not, they live in one globalized world,
he said.</P>
      <P>Lee recounted an exchange he had as a young man with a Japanese
prime minister, who argued that everyone was traveling in the same
boat.</P>
      <P>He said he had retorted then that the prime minister traveled
first class, whereas he traveled in the deck, to which the premier
had replied: "You will reach the lifeboats first."</P>
      <P>The point of the tale? If the ship sinks, everyone goes down with
it.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NP LAWMAKERS AIR '1 CHINA, 2 CHINESE STATES' FORMULA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  22  (CNA)
(By Bear Lee)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of lawmakers from the opposition
New Party (NP) on Sunday proposed a formula for "one China, two
Chinese states" as means to break the existing stalemate in relations
between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Under the formula, initiated by Prof. Chang Ya-chung of National
Chengchi University, national sovereignty will be shared by all
Chinese in Taiwan as well as the mainland. Thus China will not be
completely divided, and both the Republic of China and the People's
Republic of China will be sovereign entities with jurisdiction over
their own territory.</P>
      <P>Endorsed by the heads of the NP caucuses in the National
Assembly, Legislative Yuan and Taipei City Council, the formula calls
for Taipei and Beijing to sign a document similar to the one inked by
then West and East Germany in 1972, declaring that neither the ROC
nor the PRC will seek to separate China and making clear their
determination to pursue national unification.</P>
      <P>Under this system, the ROC and the PRC will treat each other as
"brother nations" but both are entitled to the status of independent
nations internationally.</P>
      <P>Yao Li-ming, NP party whip at the Legislative Yuan, said that
compared with the ruling Kuomintang's ambiguous "one China" concept,
which only refers to Chinese blood, culture, and history, the new
approach is clearer and more capable of easing cross-strait tension.</P>
      <P>The formula will stress there is one China legally and
politically, but that China doesn't exist substantially at the moment
because of its state of national division. China's future revival,
however, is possible, Yao said.</P>
      <P>Chu Chao-hsiang, NP National Assembly whip, said the approach
must be fully discussed and approved by NP members before it becomes
official party policy toward the mainland.</P>
      <P>The Democratic Progressive Party, Taiwan's main opposition party,
after a three-day internal debate on mainland policy earlier this
month, forged a consensus calling for "consolidating the base
(Taiwan) with gradual engagement with the mainland."</P>

      <P>About 20 policemen and six local residents
were injured early Sunday morning after more than 2,000 policemen and
over 200 people clashed over the building of an incinerator in
Hsichou township in central Changhua County.</P>
      <P>Clashes between the public and police first broke out around 3:00
a.m., after Legislator Wong Chin-chu of the Democratic Progressive
Party failed in her negotiations with local police station head Chen
Chih-jon to convince police to postpone construction of the
incinerator until Chunghua County Magistrate Juan Kang-meng returns
from an overseas trip.</P>
      <P>Chen refused Wong's request and claimed that it was his
responsibility to help remove barriers to construction of the
incinerator, as the project has been blocked for more than three
years.</P>
      <P>But the more than 200 protesters from local Hsichou township and
Hsilou township of neighboring Yunlin County, who were already
staging a sit-in protest outside the construction site, began to
attack the policemen by throwing rocks, excrement, bricks and poles
after those manning the frontline of their ranks were forcibly
removed by the officers.</P>
      <P>The second round of clashes erupted around 4:25 a.m. after police
failed again in efforts to convince the protesters to drop their
weapons and resolve the conflict peacefully.</P>
      <P>Police then decided to disperse the crowd by force, and six
protesters and nearly 20 policemen were wounded as the two sides
exchanged blows with poles and riot shields.</P>
      <P>Under heavy police escort, trucks were able to drive into the
construction site at around 4:30 a.m., while some protesters
continued to roam about the vicinity.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Vincent Siew on Sunday attended
a joint service to mourn the victims from southern Taiwan's main city
of Kaohsiung who perished in last week's tragic air crash at Chiang
Kai-shek International Airport, extending his condolences to the
victims' family members.</P>
      <P>Siew, accompanied by Minister Without Portfolio Lin Feng-cheng
and several other officials, arrived at the Kaohsiung Municipal
Funeral Parlor, where the service took place, on Sunday morning. He
paid homage to the dead by spreading incense around the parlor.</P>
      <P>Appearing reluctant to answer questions from members of the press
concerning governmental steps in handling the worst accident in
Taiwan's aviation history, an obviously grieving premier said only
that he has instructed Lin to form a task force to carry out
necessary work in the aftermath of the crash, which took lives of 202
people.</P>
      <P>A China Airlines Airbus A-300 plane, en route from the Indonesian

identification of remains and compensation payments for victims'
families.</P>
      <P>Siew has also directed that a nationwide memorial ceremony be
held after all immediate matters related to the crash have been
properly concluded, the minister said, adding that the premier hopes
the tragedy will be taken as a lesson by all related institutions
that aviation safety can never be neglected.</P>

    <HEADLINE>WIDE GAP REMAINS OVER LIQUOR TAXES IN TAIWAN-EU WTO TALKS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 23 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan will begin a new round of talks with
the European Union (EU) on Tuesday to discuss the island's bid for
entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO).</P>
      <P>Jean-Pierre de Laet, deputy head of the EU unit in charge of WTO
talks with Taiwan, and Chen Ruey-lung, director general of the ROC
Board of Foreign Trade, will lead the delegations for their
respective sides.</P>
      <P>Officials noted that the two sides remain far apart on Taiwan's
monopoly taxes on imported liquors from European countries.</P>
      <P>ROC Vice Minister of Economics Lin Yi-fu said earlier that after
more than four years of talks with the EU on terms for Taiwan's entry
into the world trade regulatory body, 90 percent of the contentious
issues have been resolved.</P>
      <P>But there is still a wide difference on imports into Taiwan of
whiskey and brandy from EU members, which is the most thorny issue of
the talks, Lin added.</P>
      <P>With the steep depreciation of the New Taiwan dollar and the
inroads made by Japanese whiskey imports into the local market during
the past year, the market share for Scotch whisky and French cognac
in Taiwan has fallen dramatically.</P>
      <P>Against this background, the Taipei-based European Council of
Commerce and Trade (ECCT), British Trade and Cultural Office, and
the Scotch Whisky Association recently called on the officials from
the Ministry of Finance to complain about the loss of competitiveness
by their nations and to seek redress for what they called "unfair
treatment."</P>
      <P>The ECCT said that if Taiwan fails to satisfactorily address the
problem, it will seek to put the issue on the table during the
upcoming talks. In addition, it will not rule out the possibility of
suggesting that the EU impose heavy tariffs on imported goods from
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Taiwan currently imposes a monopoly tax of NT$1,000 (US$30.48)
per liter of French cognac, compared with NT$500 for per liter of
brandy from other nations. Taiwan also imposes a monopoly tax of
NT$440 for per liter of Scotch whisky, compared with NT$198 for per
liter of whiskey from other countries.</P>
      <P>European liquor manufacturers said the tax is discriminatory
toward their products.</P>
      <P>The Scotch Whisky Association said sales of scotch in Taiwan
have been cut by 10 million pounds due to the depreciation of the New
Taiwan dollar and the influx of Japanese whiskey imports since last
year.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has so far completed talks with 24 of 26 WTO members who
requested bilateral negotiations with Taiwan on its bid to enter the
WTO.</P>
      <P>With the conclusion of such talks with the United States over the
weekend, Taiwan is hoping to quickly conclude negotiations with the
two remaining WTO signatories, the 15-member EU and Switzerland, and
to clear up all outstanding bilateral consultations by early March.</P>

    <HEADLINE>VICE PRESIDENT LIEN CHAN LEAVES FOR JORDAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 23 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Lien Chan left for Jordan on
Monday for a private visit aimed at boosting bilateral friendship and
cooperation.</P>
      <P>Lien will make a transit stop in Bangkok and is scheduled to
arrive in Amman at around 5:00 p.m. (Taipei time).</P>
      <P>Reliable sources said Lien will receive an honorary doctorate
from Jordan University on Tuesday. He is also expected to meet with
Jordanian officials during his stay there.</P>
      <P>Despite the absence of formal diplomatic ties between the two
countries, Jordan has long been friendly toward the Republic of
China. Jordan recognizes Beijing, but allows the Taipei
representative office in Amman to bear the ROC's official national
title. ROC President Lee Teng-hui made a private visit to Jordan in
1995.</P>
      <P>Lien will travel to Lebanon and Bahrain following his Jordan
visit, the sources said. The two Middle East states also do not
maintain official ties with the ROC.</P>
      <P>Bahrain is a major Middle East oil exporter and an important base
for the US Navy Fifth Fleet. Lien will be the first senior ROC
official to visit the Persian Gulf emirate in recent years.</P>
      <P>This is Lien's second trip abroad so far this year. He traveled
to Singapore in January.</P>
      <P>Following his Middle East journey, Lien is also expected to make
a stopover in Kuala Lumpur to meet with senior Malaysian officials,
including Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad and Deputy Prime Minister
Anwar Ibrahim, to discuss effective measures to cope with the current
Asian financial woes. Anwar made a brief private visit to Taipei
earlier this month.</P>
      <P>The government is tight-lipped on Lien's current overseas visit
to avoid affecting his itinerary. Premature exposure caused some
troubles for the vice president during his visit to Singapore early
this year.</P>
      <P>Mainland China has been waging an extensive campaign
against the ROC's diplomatic activities in an attempt to isolate
Taiwan in the international community. Against this backdrop, senior
ROC officials often keep their overseas travel plans secret or
low-profile. Previous experience has that protests from Beijing can
force changes in such plans.</P>
      <P>It remains unclear whether Lien will travel to Europe following
his Middle East tour. He had planned to visit Spain to receive an
honorary doctorate degree from Madrid University last year, but he
was forced to give up the trip because of Beijing's protests.</P>
      <P>Despite Beijing's pressure, Lien still had managed to visit
several major countries which do not maintain formal diploamtic ties
with the ROC in the past few years, including the Czech Republic,
Austria, Ukraine, Iceland and Ireland.</P>
      <P>On his Middle East visit, Lien is being accompanied by his wife
and several senior government officials and close aides, including
Minister Without Portfolio Yang Shih-chien and Deputy
Secretary-General to the President Su Chi. Lien is scheduled to
return to Taipei on March 4.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT LEE TO PRESIDE OVER CONFAB ON ABORIGINAL POLICY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  23  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Lee Teng-hui will personally
preside over a high-level meeting to examine governmental policies
aimed at improving the livelihood of Taiwan's aboriginal peoples,
sources from the Presidential Office said on Monday.</P>
      <P>After a trip to an Atayal tribal village in Fuhsing, in northern
Taiwan's Taoyuan County, on Sunday, Lee said he realized more than
ever that the welfare of Taiwan's aborigines has been neglected for
too long.</P>
      <P>He said policies on aborigines' living rights, sustainable
development of their cultures, education and employment rights should
be comprehensively overhauled.</P>
      <P>The visit to the Atayal village in Fuhsing was the third of its
kind undertaken by Lee since the beginning of this year in an effort
to better understand the aboriginal people's way of life. Earlier in
the day, Lee also visited an aboriginal village under the Sanying
Bridge in Taipei County.</P>
      <P>Last month, Lee visited an aboriginal village in Hsichih,
suburban Taipei, where some 500 indigenous people originally from
eastern Taiwan's Hualien and Taitung counties reside in shacks
without electricity or running water.</P>
      <P>Lee said justice and righteousness are two vital ingredients for
the sustainable development of a society or nation. Thus, he added,
securing the social rights of Taiwan's aboriginal people, women and
children, as well as the island's less-privileged groups, has become
a priority task for the government.</P>
      <P>Accompanying Lee during the trip to Fuhsing was Legislator Kao
Yang-sheng, an Atayal lawmaker representing the ruling Kuomintang in
the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Kao elaborated upon the plight of aborigines around the island,
numbering roughly 360,000 and representing nine tribes, to the
president.</P>
      <P>Citing unfair land policy as one of the major complaints of the
island's poorest ethnic group, he said some areas in Alishan, Heping,
Fuhsing and Wusheh have been unreasonably restricted from use by the
aborigines, the original inhabitants of those areas, so that their
immediate livelihood has been threatened.</P>
      <P>Kao urged the government to return parts of the land to the
aborigines, help them in employment opportunities, and financially
assist in the preservation of their diverse yet endangered cultures.</P>
      <P>About one-tenth of the island's aborigines now live in outlying
areas of greater Taipei. Most of them are poor and have little hope
of leading better lives.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>If Taipei agrees to engage in
political negotiations, the Beijing-based Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) is ready to immediately begin talks,
ARATS Secretary-General Zhang Jincheng said over the weekend.</P>
      <P>He added that ARATS is also willing to expand contacts and
strengthen cross-strait communications channels prior to the start of
procedural discussions for political negotiations and the resumption
of economic and protocol-related talks.</P>
      <P>Zhang made the remarks on Saturday when he attended a seminar
sponsored by the California-based Alliance for China Reunification,
China Council for Promoting Peaceful Reunification, and the Institute
of China Political Strategy.</P>
      <P>Cross-strait political negotiations, Zhang said, should address
all issues that create tension between Taipei and Beijing, including
matters pertaining to the termination of cross-strait hostility and
the political questions which concern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Zhang said that ARATS will continue to actively promote political
negotiations with its Taipei-based counterpart, the Straits Exchange
Foundation, in order to establish suitable conditions for the
improvement and further development of cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>He said: "The political negotiations we advocate are divided into
several phases, and will be carried out step by step. Firstly, we
must talk about putting an end to hostility between the two sides,
and that means not talking about the issue of reunification
immediately. It is evident that we have paid adequate consideration
to the present realities and to Taiwan's doubts and concerns about
relations across the strait."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan will not be forced into opening
direct trade, postal and transportation links with mainland China
even if the two archrivals are both allowed to join the World Trade
Organization (WTO), a spokesman for the Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC) said on Monday.</P>
      <P>Sheu Ke-sheng, vice chairman of the MAC, Taiwan's top agency in
charge of mainland Chinese affairs, noted that the timing of Taiwan's
and mainland China's entry into the WTO remains up in the air. But
even if both sides gain membership, Taiwan will not be obliged to
open the so-called "three direct links" with the mainland. he said.</P>
      <P>The existing WTO protocol does not require members of the world
trade regulatory body to directly engage in transportation or
investment exchanges, therefore Taiwan will not necessarily alter its
current policies regarding such links with mainland China after the
WTO accession, Sheu noted.</P>
      <P>Taiwan, however, will inevitably liberalize parts of its trade
regime upon admission to the WTO so as to comply with the
organization's rules and its spirit of free trade, Sheu added.</P>
      <P>Those issues, including the liberalization of some areas of the
island's trade and financial sectors, will be the responsibility of

      <P>Tensions between Australia and Japan over
tuna fishing intensified after Tokyo announced it would increase the
catch of the endangered southern bluefin tuna to 8,000 tons a year
from the current quota of 6,000 tons.</P>
      <P>Australian Resources and Energy Minister Warwick Parer said his

      <P>He said Australia could not accept Japan's plan to increase the
tuna catch because the stock of the fish is depleting.</P>
      <P>"Australia cannot accept Japan's position. Our fisheries
scientists believe that the stock is severely depleted and that the
proposed catch increase is unsustainable," he told reporters Sunday.</P>
      <P>Australia and Japan annually hold talks to set the quota of tuna

      <P>Mainland China's pledge to maintain its
currency at the present level is expected to cost its economic growth
rate by three percentage points, according to Beijing's vice minister
for foreign trade and economic cooperation, Long Yongtu.</P>
      <P>Long, currently on a visit to Australia, told a conference at the
Australian National University in Canberra that Beijing would not
devalue its currency to boost trade competitiveness because this
would set off a new round of destabilization in the Asian region.</P>
      <P>He said, however, that the Asian economic crisis would cause
mainland China's gross domestic product growth to slow from the 10
percent to 11 percent seen over the past few years to about 8 percent
in 1998.</P>
      <P>He said the growth would be achieved only because of the US$750
billion infrastructure program unveiled by mainland Chinese officials
at the recent World Economic Forum in Davos, the Philippines.</P>
      <P>He said Beijing would push ahead with reforms to its banking and
finance sector to insulate the mainland economy from the effects of

    <HEADLINE>AUSSIE SCIENTISTS DEVELOP 'ELECTRONIC BIRD' TO PROSPECT COOPER, GOLD AND OTHER METALS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Feb.  23  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australian scientists have developed a
revolutionary "electronic bird" that will make possible prospecting
for buried copper, gold, lead, zinc, nickel and even diamond deposits
from the sky.</P>
      <P>The bird resembles a two-meter-long torpedo and is towed by
aircraft flying just 100 meters above the ground. It is expected to
open up vast areas of Australia for mineral exploration.</P>
      <P>The new device was developed by scientists of the Cooperative
Research Center for Australian Minerals Explorations Technologies of
Macquarie University in New South Wales following a six-year research
project, according to mass-circulation newspaper The Sydney Morning
Herald.</P>
      <P>Instead of the costly and laborious process of drilling through
rock, the bird utilizes the fact that all minerals -- and the types
of ground they are buried in -- conduct electricity to varying
degrees.</P>
      <P>Electrical bursts are sent along a wire wrapped around the bird's
tow plane at intervals of up to 500 times per second, creating a
magnetic field. This causes weak electric currents to flow through
the earth, producing tell-tale magnetic fields which in turn are
monitored by the device, according to Dr. Brian Spies, director of
the research center at Macquarie University.</P>
      <P>He said the buried minerals can be identified by analyzing
variations in the man-made magnetic fields.</P>
      <P>He said the electronic bird was developed from work begun in
Scandinavia and Canada in the late 1940s.</P>
      <P>"Australia is now recognized as a world leader in this
technology," he said. "With the sensitivity we have developed we can
now get a 3-D (dimension) image of the ground."</P>
      <P>He said he believes the new device will be widely used in
exploring for large mineral deposits in Australia as well as abroad.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN LEADERS TALK ABOUT RELATIONS WITH MAINLAND CHINA (1)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  23  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Government officials and leaders of
political parties in Taiwan have recently talked about policies
toward mainland China, with most of them saying that friendly
exchanges and talks are important to the improvement of the relations
between Taiwan and mainland China.</P>
      <P>Premier Vincent Siew of the Republic of China showed a gesture of
goodwill to mainland China Friday when he delivered an administrative
report at the Legislative Yuan on the first day of the current
legislative session.</P>
      <P>When talking about dialogues between Taiwan and mainland China,
Siew said all subjects that may contribute to peaceful development on
both sides of the Taiwan Strait and relate to democratic unification
of the nation may be put forth step by step for discussion.</P>
      <P>Last month, Beijing repeated its calls for holding political
talks with Taiwan under the principle of "one China." The calls are
believed by people here to be Beijing's attempt to annex Taiwan "in
name."</P>
      <P>Talks between the heads of the two sides' semi-official
intermediary organizations, Koo Chen-fu of the Taipei-based Strait
Exchange Foundation (SEF) and Wang Daohan of the Beijing-based
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) were held
for the first time in Singapore in April, 1993. Their consultations,
focused mainly on problems arising from the increasing civilian
exchanges, are usually called "technical" talks, or Koo-Wang talks.</P>
      <P>The preparations for the second round of Koo-Wang talks were
unilaterally disrupted by Beijing in June, 1995 soon after President
Lee Teng-hui's private visit to the United States angered Beijing
leaders.</P>
      <P>Beijing has since insisted that the technical talks won't be
resumed unless Taiwan agrees to hold political talks on unification
under the principle of "one China," which is communist China.
Beijing has also insisted on its "one country, two system" formula
for unification with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Premier Siew's remark is believed to be a gesture of goodwill to
Beijing by analysts in Taipei, because it implies that political
issues, if they are conducive to peaceful development and democratic
unification, may also be put forth for talks between the two sides.</P>
      <P>He said those technical issues which are directly related to the
interests of the people on Taiwan and the Chinese mainland and have
formerly been selected for consultations in the second round of
Koo-Wang talks should be given priority.</P>
      <P>Siew stressed that new talks should start from the agenda of the
second round of Koo-Wang talks, which has been postponed since June,
1995.</P>
      <P>Siew said the government will persistently carry out its policy
of "eliminating hostility through communications and replacing
confrontation with consultations" with sincerity and goodwill. The
government is trying to promote cross-strait exchanges and
discussions under the principles of mutual respect, equality, and
mutual benefit to create a "win-win" situation for both sides, he
added.</P>
      <P>He expressed the hope that Beijing will agree to resume Koo-Wang
talks and reopen the channel of communications established in the
first round of the talks as soon as possible for the prosperity and
peaceful development of the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>"The door of cross-strait discussions is always open, and the
government is holding positive and pragmatic attitudes toward
cross-strait relations," he added. (more)</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN LEADERS TALK ABOUT RELATIONS WITH MAINLAND CHINA (2)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  23  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Meanwhile, Vice President Lien Chan recently set forth "three nos
and three yeses" as an approach to improvement of cross-strait
relations.</P>
      <P>The three "nos" are no declaration of independence, no hurry to
unify with the Chinese mainland, and no antagonism, and the three
"yeses" are yes to peace, yes to friendly exchanges, and yes to a
"win-win" situation for both sides. There is no need to declare
independence, because the country has been a sovereign state since
its establishment in 1912, he explained.</P>
      <P>The approach will provide the best condition for promoting
friendly exchanges and moving toward eventual reunification of the
Chinese nation, he said, adding that continuous exchanges would
enhance mutual understanding and reduce hostilities, and thus
prevent conflicts between the two sides.</P>
      <P>Lien pointed out that a "latent antagonistic atmosphere" still
lingers. Beijing is now hoping to annex Taiwan "in name," he said.</P>
      <P>He said Taiwan and mainland China will eventually be able to
reach their common goal of national unification under the principles
of freedom, democracy, and equal distribution of wealth, if the two
sides can sit down "to resume their talks without setting
preconditions and excluding any particular issues."</P>
      <P>Analysts here believe that Beijing is very unlikely to give up
such preconditions as the "one China" principle and the "one China,
two system" formula for unification. Beijing also dislikes the
rhetoric of "unification under the principles of freedom, democracy,
and equal distribution of wealth," because its ultimate goal is to
put Taiwan under communist rule.</P>
      <P>They also believe that Beijing would hate to talk with Taipei
about human rights, private property, freedom of the press,
multi-party political system, free economy, and many other values of
the free world.</P>
      <P>Lien made the remarks on Feb. 19 in an international conference
on "The People's Republic of China after the 15th Party Congress,"
which was held in Beijing in September, 1997.</P>
      <P>Some 30 factional leaders of Taiwan's major opposition
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) debated policies toward mainland
China in a seminar sponsored by the party on Feb. 13-15 in Taipei.</P>
      <P>In the beginning of the three-day seminar, Hsu Hsin-liang, DPP
chairman and leader of the Formosa Faction, stressed that Taiwan
should "boldly deal with the west side of the Taiwan Strait" for
economic and trade reasons. His position was strongly criticized by
leaders of other factions. At the end of the meeting, the DPP
leaders reached the consensus that Taiwan should "strengthen its base
and deal with the west side."</P>
      <P>John Chang, secretary general of the ruling Kuomintang, said
Saturday that the consensus "clearly endorses" the ruling party's
long-standing policy toward mainland China.</P>
      <P>At the seminar, the DPP leaders also declared that Taiwan is a
sovereign state, whose sovereignty will never be negotiated , and
that Taiwan can hold "all-dimension talks" with mainland China.</P>
      <P>By "all-dimension talks," they mean that Taiwan can talk with
mainland China on all kinds of subjects, so that talks can go on and
on without ending.</P>
      <P>The DPP participants in the seminar were criticized by
some analysts as being too naive and ignorant of Beijing's strategy
and ambition to annex Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chang Jung-kung, director general of the Mainland Operations 
Department of the Kuomintang Central Committee, said last week that
the debate made the DPP look more able to keep up with cross-strait
situations now than it was in April, 1993 when it sent
representatives to Singapore to protest against the first round of
Koo-Wang talks being held there.</P>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Chen Shui-bian, who is a DPP leader but did not
participate in the debate, said last week that the opposition party's
pro-Taiwan independence platform is the "mainstream position" of the
party, which had not been changed by the debate in any way.</P>
      <P>The platform says that Taiwan is a sovereign state independent of
the People's Republic of China. There is one country on either side
of the Taiwan Strait. "Taiwan is not a part or a vassal of China,"
Chen said. The position is in sharp contrast with that of communist
China.</P>
      <P>Vice President Lien pointed out in the international conference
on mainland China that one of the factors underlying the post-1995
stalemate in cross-strait relations is the big difference in
political development between mainland China and Taiwan. The mainland
is governed by a Leninist, one-party dictatorship, while Taiwan is
ruled by a democratic government.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN UNEMPLOYMENT DROPS TO 22-MONTH LOW</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 23 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's unemployment rate dropped to 2.35
percent in January, marking a 22-month low since April 1996, the
Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS)
reported on Monday.</P>
      <P>According to DGBAS tallies, the January unemployment rate was
2.35 percent, down 0.1 percentage points from December's figure, and
0.33 percentage points less than the year-earlier level.</P>
      <P>The DGBAS attributed January's relatively lower unemployment to
increased employment in the service sector, which saw an increase of
26,000 employees over December.</P>
      <P>In January, 224,000 of Taiwan's workforce were reportedly
jobless, down some 10,000 from the previous month, while the number
of people who lost their jobs due to workplace closures or downsizing
declined 18,000 in comparison with the same month of last year.</P>
      <P>The number of first-time job seekers and the number of those who
quit because of dissatisfaction with their jobs also declined 28,000
in January from the year-earlier level, the DGBAS reported.</P>
      <P>Average periods of unemployment in January, however, were found
to be getting longer, with the tallies showing an average wait of 25
weeks before an unemployed person finds a new job, one week longer
than in the previous month.</P>
      <P>First-time job seekers, meanwhile, stayed idle for an average of
27 weeks before finding a job, one week longer than the period
reported in December, the DGBAS said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FM HU CONCLUDES SIX-COUNTRY AFRICAN DIPLOMATIC TOUR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  23  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Minister of Foreign
Affairs Jason Hu returned to Taipei on Monday after winding up a
six-country African visit aimed at shoring up the ROC's diplomatic
ties with its allies in the region.</P>
      <P>Hu described his 10-day diplomatic tour as "fruitful and
significant," saying that the visit has attracted extensive media
coverage in Africa and created a "Taiwan whirlwind" there.</P>
      <P>Hu's trip took him to Chad, Guinea-Bissau, The Gambia, Liberia,
Sao Tome and Principe, and Burkina Faso. "I received warm welcomes in
all these countries," the foreign minister said, adding that the six
countries have all expressed a strong desire to reinforce bilateral
relationships and expand cooperation with the ROC.</P>
      <P>Hu went on to say that many of the senior officials he met told
him that the main purpose of their engagement with the ROC is to
learn from the `Taiwan Experience' to help boost their own economic
development.</P>
      <P>Against this background, Hu said, the government and the private
sector should join forces to introduce Taiwan's experience in
economic development and business management to the country's African
allies to help cement bilateral ties.</P>
      <P>"We should work even harder to assist our allies in development
in various fields, so that they will feel it a glory to maintain
diplomatic relations with the ROC," Hu said. "This will help create a
`lighthouse effect,' shining a beacon that will attract more
countries to forge ties with us."</P>
      <P>The ROC has dispatched agricultural, medical, handicraft and
engineering missions to many other developing countries over the past
several decades to help them implement economic development and
infrastructure construction projects, Hu said.</P>
      <P>However, he stressed that these efforts should not be interpreted
as "checkbook diplomacy." Compared with other countries, Hu said, the
ROC's financial aid to its allies remains limited.</P>
      <P>For instance, France alone offers US$140 million in aid to
Burkina Faso annually, and the annual aid from the European Union to
the French-speaking West African country also reaches US$130 million.
Many other advanced countries, including the United States, Canada,
Denmark and Spain, also offer far more aid to that country than the
ROC.</P>
      <P>Hu pointed out that the ROC's annual budget for foreign aid
accounts for less than 0.1 percent of its Gross National Product
(GNP), far lower than the 0.7 percent level set by the United Nations
for advanced countries. "I hope the government will increase the
foreign aid budget to 0.175 percent of our GNP to enable more of our
allies to share the Taiwan Experience," he said.</P>
      <P>During his visit, Hu also discussed with relevant African
officials the itinerary of President Lee Teng-hui's planned visit to
several African countries in late March. The itinerary will be
formally announced either late this month or in early March.</P>
      <P>In related news, Hu touched on Vice President Lien Chan's ongoing
Middle East visit, which he described as part of the ROC's "outreach"
efforts to counter Beijing's extensive campaign to isolate Taiwan in
the international community.</P>
      <P>"We must walk out boldly and firmly into the world arena," Hu
said, adding that the ROC should not let Beijing feel it can succeed
in depriving Taiwan of all opportunities to forge ties abroad. "To
walk out is critical to our survival," he emphasized.</P>
      <P>Hu said he earnestly hopes the mainland Chinese authorities will
understand that they cannot and need not block the ROC's
international activities. "Based on this understanding, relations
across the Taiwan Strait will be able to move forward even more
smoothly and swiftly," he added.</P>

      <P>Five leading computer and commercial

technology to prevent users making illegal copies of digital movies,
software and other digital recordings, according to reports from the
Geneva-based World Trade Organization (WTO) on Monday.</P>
      <P>Intel of the US and Hitachi, Matsushita, Sony and Toshiba of
Japan have jointly developed the encoding method, which could be used
to protect copyright materials transmitted via the Internet, over TV
cable systems or between home electronics systems, the WTO report
said.</P>
      <P>The technology would prevent piracy of digital recordings such as
compact discs (CDs) and the latest digital video discs (DVDs). It
could also be used to block copying of "pay per view" TV
transmissions.</P>
      <P>High definition TV sets, personal computers, DVD players, digital
audio cassette recorders and TV set-up boxes could be equipped with
the encryption technology, the WTO report said.</P>
      <P>The system would require a password to be entered before
copyrighted material could be transferred from one device to another.</P>
      <P>There has been widespread concern within the entertainment

    <HEADLINE>ROC VICE PRESIDENT LIEN LEAVES BANGKOK FOR JORDAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Bangkok, Feb. 23 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Vice President Lien Chan
left Bangkok for the Middle Eastern country of Jordan on Monday
afternoon following a brief transit stop here.</P>
      <P>Speaking to reporters at Bangkok airport, Lien said he hopes to
keep his Middle East visit at a low profile, since excessive media
hype may affect his itinerary.</P>
      <P>In addition to Jordan, Lien is also expected to visit Lebanon and
Bahrain. None of the three countries maintain formal diplomatic ties
with the ROC.</P>
      <P>Lien is scheduled to arrive in Amman, capital of Jordan, at
around midnight (local time).</P>
      <P>This is Lien's second trip abroad so far this year. He visited
Singapore in January.</P>
      <P>Reliable sources said Lien will receive an honorary doctorate
from Jordan University on Tuesday. He is also expected to meet with
Jordanian officials during his stay there.</P>
      <P>Despite the absence of formal diplomatic ties between the two
countries, Jordan has long been friendly toward the Republic of
China. Jordan recognizes Beijing, but allows the Taipei
representative office in Amman to bear the ROC's official national
title. ROC President Lee Teng-hui made a private visit to Jordan in
1995.</P>
      <P>Lien will travel to Lebanon and Bahrain following his Jordan
visit, the sources said.</P>
      <P>Bahrain is a major Middle East oil exporter and an important base
for the US Navy Fifth Fleet. Lien will be the first senior ROC
official to visit the Persian Gulf emirate in recent years.</P>
      <P>Following his Middle East journey, Lien is also expected to make
a stopover in Kuala Lumpur to meet with senior Malaysian officials,
including Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad and Deputy Prime Minister
Anwar Ibrahim, to discuss effective measures to cope with the current
Asian financial woes. Anwar made a brief private visit to Taipei
earlier this month.</P>
      <P>The government is tight-lipped on Lien's current overseas visit
to avoid affecting his itinerary. Premature exposure caused some
troubles for the vice president during his visit to Singapore early
this year.</P>
      <P>Mainland China has been waging an extensive campaign
against the ROC's diplomatic activities in an attempt to isolate
Taiwan in the international community. Against this backdrop, senior
ROC officials often keep their overseas travel plans secret or
low-profile. Previous experience has that protests from Beijing can
force changes in such plans.</P>
      <P>It remains unclear whether Lien will travel to Europe following
his Middle East tour. He had planned to visit Spain to receive an
honorary doctorate degree from Madrid University last year, but he
was forced to give up the trip because of Beijing's protests.</P>
      <P>Despite Beijing's pressure, Lien still had managed to visit
several major countries which do not maintain formal diploamtic ties
with the ROC in the past few years, including the Czech Republic,
Austria, Ukraine, Iceland and Ireland.</P>
      <P>On his Middle East visit, Lien is being accompanied by his wife
and several senior government officials and close aides, including
Minister Without Portfolio Yang Shih-chien and Deputy
Secretary-General to the President Su Chi. Lien is scheduled to
return to Taipei on March 4.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SIXTH LAFAYETTE FRIGATE TO ARRIVE IN ROC SOON</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung, Feb. 23 (CNA)
(By Bear Lee)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The last of six Lafayette-class frigates
that Taiwan has ordered from France will arrive in Taiwan soon,
Republic of China military sources said on Monday.</P>
      <P>ROC naval officers and crew who took delivery of the frigate at a
shipyard at the French port of Lorient on Jan. 16, are sailing the
frigate to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>After a 40-day, 24,000-kilometer voyage, the frigate, to be
christened "Cheng Teh," will arrive at a southern Taiwan marine base,
where high ranking central government officials will be invited to a
ceremony to review the new vessel together with the five others that
have already been delivered.</P>
      <P>The new frigate will be commissioned in March, after which it
will undergo a series of test-and-training operations before it is
put into active service two months later.</P>
      <P>Taiwan placed an order with France in 1991 for the six advanced
frigates, for a total cost of US$2.3 billion.</P>
      <P>In order to avoid possible protests or a boycott from mainland
China, Taiwan and France kept the deal very low-profile. The first
two ships were delivered in 1996 and the next three in 1997.</P>
      <P>Taiwan naval personnel have been undergoing training in Lorient
to learn how to operate and maintain the advanced frigates.</P>
      <P>With a displacement of 3,500 tons and a top speed of 25 knots,
the frigates' outer hull is clad with a special composite material
which makes them less visible to radar and has earned them the
nickname of "stealth frigate."</P>
      <P>Upon arrival in Taiwan, the new frigate will be armed with the
Phalanx air defense system, Sea Chaparral surface-to-surface
missiles, domestically produced Hsiung-Feng anti-ship missiles and an
anti-submarine helicopter.</P>
      <P>The five other Lafayette frigates have been christened "Kang
Ting," "Hsi Ning," "Kun Ming," "Ti Hua," and "Wu Chang."</P>
      <P>The six new vessels, along with the six Knox-class ships Taiwan
has on lease from the United States and eight locally-made
Perry-class warships, will form the backbone of Taiwan's naval fleet,
allowing it to phase out its fleet of aging destroyers.</P>
      <P>As part of its overall military modernization program, Taiwan has
also purchased 150 US-made F-16 fighter jets and 60 French-built
Mirage 2000-5s, as well as 130 locally produced Indigenous Defense
Fighters.</P>

    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Feb.  23  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Media magnate Rupert Murdoch and his
company, News Corp., have succeeded in winning the favor of mainland
China's leaders and have strengthened their position to make inroads
into the mainland market.</P>
      <P>In a dispatch from Beijing, mass circulation newspaper The Sydney
Morning Herald's correspondent David Lague said Murdoch has won a
tribute from mainland China's President Jiang Zemin, and his
ministers and senior cadres, because he used a special screening of
the multimillion dollar blockbuster "Titanic" to entertain them.</P>
      <P>The News Corp.'s diplomacy seems to be paying off for the media
giant as it recovers from Murdoch's damaging 1993 threat that
satellite television was "an unambiguous threat to totalitarian
regimes everywhere."</P>
      <P>The daily quoted Bruce Dover, vice president of News Corp. in
China, as saying that he organized the private viewing in the Chinese
capital for Jiang and his ministers and senior cadres and that they
liked the movie.</P>
      <P>Dover has been coordinating News Corp.'s low-key recovery in
mainland China through a series of joint venture business
partnerships with mainland Chinese companies.</P>
      <P>Media industry analysts report that the company is now in a
strong position, as its major rivals, including Disney and Sony, have
angered Beijing with films about Chinese repression in Tibet.</P>
      <P>News Corp.'s businesses are already making headway in the tightly
restricted mainland market. Through a 45 percent stake in the
satellite Phoenix Channel, News Corp.'s Hong Kong-based Star TV
claims it has an audience of about 36 million viewers in mainland
China and has won approval to collect advertising fees from foreign
companies in Guangdong Province, the daily reported.</P>
      <P>In addition, News Corp.'s Internet service, PDN Xinren
Information Technology Company, a joint venture with the Chinese
Communist Party's official mouthpiece the People's Daily, now has the
most popular Website in mainland China, the daily reported.</P>
      <P>In order to win even more favors from Beijing, Murdoch is
attempting to censor harsh criticism of the mainland leadership
contained in a new book by former Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten.</P>
      <P>Murdoch has told senior managers at his Harper Collins publishing
company to ensure that observations about the mainland leadership are
toned down, the daily reported.</P>

    <HEADLINE>COA TO BUDGET NT$80 BILLION FOR ASSISTING FARMERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 23 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council of Agriculture (COA) will form
a task force to help local farmers tide over the difficulties they
will face following the Republic of China's entry into the World
Trade Organization (WTO), a senior official said on Monday.</P>
      <P>"As far as the agriculture is concerned, the ROC has completed
bilateral negotiations with all of the 26 WTO members which have
expressed intentions to hold bilateral talks the ROC on terms for its
WTO accesion," said COA Chairman Peng Tzuo-kuei.</P>
      <P>In exchange for their support of the ROC's WTO bid, Taiwan
has agreed to offer them greater market access to their
agricultural products, services, industrial goods, wine and
tobacco. Among them, the agricultural sector is expected to be hit
hardest by tariff cuts and market-opening measures promised by the
ROC in consultative procedures.</P>
      <P>Peng said the COA's main task now is to help local farmers adapt
themselves to the new market situation. "The COA will form a task
force to draw up a comprehensive package of measures to cope with
anticipated increasing competition from foreign suppliers of various
agricultural products."</P>
      <P>The task force, to be headed by COA Vice Chairman Ling
Shiang-nung, will comprise government officials, academics and senior
executives of major agricultural and relevant industrial
associations.</P>
      <P>Five panels will be established under the task force to study
the current states of five agricultural sectors -- rice, vegetables
and fruits, hog, poultry and fishery -- and work out strategies to
address the possible adverse impact on all those sectors.</P>
      <P>Peng said the government will set aside a budget of NT$86.9
billion (US$2.63 billion) over the next six years to help local
farmers adjust production and marketing strategies and upgrade
competitiveness. Part of the money will be used to help those
who would not continue their agricultural or husbandry operations to
switch to other professions.</P>
      <P>Peng said the COA will spend about NT$48.2 billion helping local
hog and poultry farmers adjust their production and marketing
systems, and will also spend some NT$38.7 billion helping rice
growers streamline production structure.</P>
      <P>"Our top policy guideline is to assist those who want to stay in
the agricultural sector to upgrade production and marketing
strategies while helping those who want to swtich to other sectors
succeed in their bids," Peng stressed.</P>

NT$38,600 (US$1,177) last year, up 4.07 percent from the
year-earlier-level (adjusted for inflation), the highest rise in the
past few years, according to official statistics.</P>
      <P>The Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics
(DGBAS) on Monday released new figures on wages and productivity on
the island that showed an average wage of NT$38,800 (US$1,183) last
December, up 12.02 percent from the previous month.</P>
      <P>The December surge, higher than that of other months, was mainly
due to many local companies distributing year-end bonuses and
job-performance awards, the DGBAS said.</P>
      <P>According to the DGBAS tallies, prompted by recovering economic
development, over 5.52 million people were employed in the island's
industrial and service sectors in 1997, up 0.95 percent from the
level of the year before.</P>
      <P>The industrial sector enjoyed an employment growth of 0.45
percent, with manufacturing scoring a 1.03 percent gain, the largest
in this sector.</P>
      <P>Employment in the service sector grew 0.75 percent, with the
financial insurance and housing subsector showing demand for human
forces by posting a 6.7 percent gain in employment, the statistics
showed.</P>
      <P>The service sector is emerging as the major creator of job
opportunities on the island, the bureau said, citing that in 1997,
the number of employees in the service sector had grown to reach
47.68 percent of the total in the industrial sector.</P>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Taipei prosecutor said on Monday that
people using the Internet to disseminate information in Taiwan on how
to manufacture illegal drugs will face punishment under the present
Republic of China Criminal Code.</P>
      <P>Chin Cheng-hsiang, a public prosecutor of the Taipei Prosecutor's
Office, was responding to news that the dissemination via cyberspace
of pornography, and information on arms and drugs, is increasingly
becoming a problem.</P>
      <P>Chin noted that most of the website addresses tend to be located
overseas, preventing effective investigation by local law enforcement
authorities, although he added that the authorities are maintaining
contact with their overseas counterparts to cooperate in the
crackdown on cybercrime.</P>
      <P>He said he believes that Internet discussions on the manufacture
of illegal drugs have not yet reached the stage of actual
manufacture, trafficking and distribution of drugs, and therefore may
not be subject to the ROC's strict anti-drug regulations, whereby
offenders face punishment of death or life in prison.</P>
      <P>He added that under the current Penal Code, those found guilty of
disseminating information on illegal drug manufacture can only be
prosecuted for violation of public order, a crime which carries a
relatively light punishment of up to two years in prison.</P>

      <P>A Taiwanese ship's captain and his 27
crewmen, accused of illegal fishing in Somali waters in the Indian
Ocean, may not be returning to Taiwan soon as the ship's owner has
said it is unable to pay the high fine to have them released.</P>
      <P>The Shun Bin Fishing Company, owner of the fishing boat, said
Monday that a court in Somalia sentenced the crew members to pay more
than NT$48 million (US$1.5 million) in fines for poaching in Somali
waters or face jail terms in excess of 10 years.</P>
      <P>The Taiwanese fishing boat "Shun Kuo No. 11" -- with six Taiwan
and 22 mainland Chinese fishermen on board -- was captured on Jan. 12
by three armed Somali speedboats. The crew has been in custody since
then.</P>
      <P>Shun Bin said that no local fishing company could afford such a
high fine. It has commissioned the Far Eastern Shipping Company to
handle the incident for it and to ensure the crew's safety.</P>
      <P>On Feb. 16, the day after the captain and crew's trial, AFP
reported that the prosecutor in the Somali Islamic court had demanded
that the captain have his right hand and left foot amputated. The
prosecutor also called for the vessel's 27 crewmen to be fined
US$10,000 each, the report said.</P>
      <P>Shun Bin said that it believes no one will have to face

      <P>On Tuesday, Taiwan will start its bilateral
negotiations with the European Union (EU) as a whole on the island's
bid to enter the World Trade Organization (WTO), the world's trade
regulatory body, an economics official revealed here Monday.</P>
      <P>Chen Ruey-long, chief of the Board of Foreign Trade (BOFT) under
the Ministry of Economic Affairs, told the press the planned three
days of talks will be held at the BOFT's Taipei headquarters and will
cover issues including tobacco and wine, financial services,
automobiles and industrial products.</P>
      <P>According to the BOFT, the first day's agenda will include the
issues of the taxation of industrial production and the opening of
Taiwan's service market, while government procurement policies will
be the major topic on the second day of talks.</P>
      <P>Scheduled for the last day is the thorny problem of the island's
opening to such European products as tobacco, wine, automobiles and
diesel engines for cars.</P>
      <P>Chen, who has been appointed Taiwan's top negotiator, said that

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 23 (CNA)
(By Lin Wen-fen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An 18 year-old girl still grieving from the
death of her father, stepmother and two half brothers in a recent
airplane crash is facing troubles she says are due to the US$1.74
million she is to gain in compensation over the accident.</P>
      <P>The girl, who identified herself only by the nickname of Hsiao
Hsuan, made public her story in a press conference on Monday. She
accused her natural mother of seeking to gain custody of her
following the death of her father out of greed for the compensation
she is to receive.</P>
      <P>Huang Shun-fa, his wife, their two sons and his parents-in-law
were passengers on the ill-fated China Airlines flight 676, which
killed all 196 passengers and crew on board as well as six people on
the ground when it crashed Feb. 16.</P>
      <P>Huang had used his Diner's Club card to purchase the tickets for
the family. Because of a Diner's Club policy, Hsiao Hsuan, the only
survivor of the family, is entitled to US$580,000 for the deaths of
her father and two brothers, a total of US$1.74 million.</P>
      <P>Hsiao Hsuan, who wore sunglasses and used a hat to help cover her
face in the press conference, said that she could not but question
her natural mother's motives in seeking to gain custody of her now,
asserting that ever since her parents got divorced when she was six
years old, her mother seldom showed any concern for her.</P>
      <P>She said that if her mother, Lan Tsai-yeh, really cares about her
safety as she said in a press conference held on Saturday, she should
agree to have her placed in the custody of the Social Department of
the Kaohsiung Government.</P>
      <P>Hsiao Hsuan also called her father a good father and a good
husband, describing him as a man with a sense of responsibility and
integrity. She said she hopes her mother will stop insulting her
father.</P>
      <P>Hsiao Hsuan said that the media exposure of the confrontation
between her and her mother over the compensation issue has hurt her
deeply and that she hasn't dared to stay at home for days but has had
to live with friends of her father.</P>
      <P>She also said that she has already made a will, and that if
something happens to her, all the money she has will be used to
establish a foundation in memory of her father.</P>
      <P>Lan said on Saturday in a press conference that she seeks the
custody of her daughter because she is concerned about her safety.
She also said that she divorced Huang because he often beat her and
had affairs with other women.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING NAVAL MONTHLY CALLS FOR CROSS-STRAIT COOP. OVER SPRATLY ISSUE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Beijing,  Feb. 23 (CNA)
(By Bear Lee)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Beijing military publication has called
for cooperation between Taiwan and mainland China in handling the
Spratly dispute.</P>
      <P>Modern Vessels, a monthly published by the mainland Chinese navy,
said that the Spratly issue could be the "starting point" of the
process of China's unification since both sides have the "fewest
conflicts" and "most mutual benefit" with regard to their stances on
the Spratlys.</P>
      <P>The Spratly Islands, consisting of around 100 islets and atolls
in the South China Sea, reportedly sit on rich crude oil reserves.
They are claimed in whole or in part by Taiwan, mainland China, the
Philippines, Malaysia, Vietnam and Brunei.</P>
      <P>Currently, Taiwan controls Taiping, the largest island in the
chain, while mainland China and the Philippines each have eight
islets, Vietnam 25, and Malaysia three.</P>
      <P>"Taipei and Beijing adhere to the same position that the Spratly
Islands are traditionally Chinese territory, a point that could serve
as the basis of cross-strait cooperation," the monthly said.</P>
      <P>"Concerted Taiwan-mainland action on the Spratly issue could
shift long-time cross-strait confrontation into cooperation, thus
increasing the cohesiveness of the Chinese and helping create a
favorable climate for national unification," it added.</P>
      <P>This is the first time that Beijing's military has openly called
on Taiwan and the mainland to join hands to defend traditionally
Chinese territory since mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin, in
his eight-point stance on policy toward Taiwan issued more than three
years ago, urged both sides to jointly safeguard Chinese sovereignty.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN) environment ministers will hold the Second
Ministerial Meeting on Haze in Kuching, Sarawak, Malaysia on Feb. 25
to review the progress of the Regional Haze Action Plan in the face
of a new outbreak of forest fires in Indonesia early this month.</P>
      <P>The objective of the meeting is to review the progress of the
action plan, particularly the areas of the plan in which Malaysia,
Singapore and Indonesia are spearheading preventive measures,
monitoring measures and the strengthening of fire fighting
capabilities, the Singapore Ministry of the Environment said on
Monday.</P>
      <P>Environment Minister and Health Minister Yeo Cheow Tong will lead
a four-member Singapore delegation participating in the meeting.</P>
      <P>While in Kuching, Yeo will also attend a high-level segment of
the Fourth Meeting of the Conference of Parties of the Basel
Convention on Feb. 26. The Basel Convention deals with the
transboundary movement of hazardous waste and toxic chemicals, the
ministry said.</P>
      <P>Under the Regional Haze Action Plan adopted by the ASEAN
environment ministers in December last year, Singapore is to
spearhead measures to monitor land and forest fires. Singapore
monitors closely the development of land and forest fires through the
use of satellite imaging.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Singapore Environment Ministry will convene a
meeting of Singapore's Inter-Ministry Haze Task Force on Feb. 25,
when the task force will reaffirm the action plans of the various
ministries and government agencies to ameliorate the impact of smoke
haze on the health and well-being of the public.</P>
      <P>In 1994, this task force formulated a Smoke Haze Action Plan
(HAP) to coordinate the overall approaches and action for minimizing
the adverse impact of smoke haze. The HAP was reviewed and updated
last year.</P>

attend the inauguration ceremony for South Korean President-elect Kim
Dae-jung.</P>
      <P>KMT sources said Chang will occupy a very conspicuous seat at
Wednesday's ceremony, in an indication of the great importance South
Korea attaches to its ties with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>This is Chang's second trip to South Korea so far this month. He
headed a high-level KMT delegation to Seoul on Feb. 11-14. During
that visit, Chang met with South Korean Prime Minister-designate Kim
Jong-pil, Parliamentarians Soon Se-il and Lew Sing-soo and several
other influential figures of various political stripes.</P>
      <P>However, Chang failed to meet South Korean President-elect Kim
because of strong pressure from Beijing. Kim later apologized for the
cancellation of their scheduled meeting through one of his close
aides. The aide also asked Chang to forward a personal letter from
Kim to ROC President Lee Teng-hui, who concurrently serves as KMT
chairman.</P>
      <P>Chang, a career diplomat, had been minister of foreign affairs
before assuming his current post late last year. Chang once said he
will actively promote the KMT's relations with major political
parties of other countries as part of Taiwan's pragmatic diplomacy
drive.</P>
      <P>Taiwan-South Korean relations have been at a low ebb since the
two countries cut diplomatic ties in August 1992. Senior officials of
both countries have expressed a desire to improve bilateral relations
after the inauguration of the new Korean president.</P>

      <P>"Their secondary goal is to disrupt the upcoming general session

substantive relationship between their country and Taiwan. Taiwan's
representative office in Canada is publishing a newsletter to change
that.</P>
      <P>In the first issue of the TECO Newsletter, which has just come
out, Dr. Chin-yen Fang of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office
said the publication aims to "contribute to a broader understanding
within Canada of the importance of the bilateral economic and
cultural relationship" between that country and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>TECO was set up seven years ago to facilitate and promote the
continued growth of the many business and cultural linkages that
exist between Canada and Taiwan. TECO performs a function similar to
the Canadian Trade Office in Taipei (CTOT), which was set up in 1986.</P>
      <P>The "substantive relationship" that the TECO representative was
trying to make Canadians more aware of includes bilateral trade which
exceeded 5 billion Canadian dollars in 1997. In fact, Fang noted,
Taiwan is now Canada's eighth largest trading partner.</P>
      <P>In addition to trade, "we are forming important personal linkages
too," Fang pointed out. He explained that Canada is one of the
preferred destinations for Taiwan tourists, thousands of Taiwan
students are enrolled in Canadian universities, and Canada has become
a target for many Taiwan business and investor immigrants.</P>
      <P>He went on to say that one unanticipated result of Taiwan
tourists visiting Banff and Niagara Falls is that "high quality
Canadian specialties like maple syrup and ice wine have become
popular products" in Taiwan. "Of course, Canadian gold coins have
long been a favorite of Taiwanese collectors," he added.</P>
      <P>The newsletter, to be published quarterly, will provide "factual
information" to Canadians so they will have a better understanding of
the nature of the Canada-Taiwan ties and the "many facets" of the
relationship.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ASIAN AEROSPACE SHOW '98 OPENS IN SINGAPORE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  Feb.  23  (CNA)
(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Asian Aerospace Show '98, the
largest and most prestigious aerospace event in the Asia-Pacific
region, officially opened in Singapore on Monday night.</P>
      <P>The opening ceremony was held at the Singapore International
Convention and Exhibition Center in downtown Singapore. The show
itself will open at the Changi Exhibition Center adjacent to the
Changi Airport for a week from Tuesday through March 1.</P>
      <P>Singapore Deputy Prime Minister and Defense Minister Tan Keng
Yam, the guest of honor at the opening ceremony, pointed out in his
speech that with the rapid growth of air traffic in the Asian
Pacific, Singapore is well-positioned to play a catalytic role to
spur further growth of the aerospace industry in the region.</P>
      <P>He cited three reasons for his assertion:</P>
      <P>First, Singapore is a strong supporter of open skies policy. The
adoption of an open skies policy by governments in the region,
coupled with greater deregulation and liberalization, will help to
build a more competitive aviation industry.</P>
      <P>Second, in terms of aviation standards, Singapore promotes strict
safety standards in the aerospace and air travel industry through
high standards of engineering maintenance and repair, and stringent
security at airports.</P>
      <P>Third, Singapore is well-poised to act as an aerospace hub in the
Asian Pacific from which companies can venture into the region.</P>
      <P>Multinational aerospace companies are welcome to establish their
operations in Singapore as a value-added location to capture new
markets, expand in the region through further investments, and serve
the growing needs of the Asian Pacific, he said.</P>
      <P>Capitalizing on the growing markets, Singapore's aerospace
industry has been expanding at a record pace. In 1997, the industry
registered a healthy 17 percent growth in output to reach 1.84
billion Singapore dollars, he said. About 35 percent of the output
was for the United States and Europe markets, while 65 percent was
for the Asian markets, he added.</P>
      <P>He stressed that Singapore is prepared to commit its resources,
both personnel and money, in good times and bad, to develop the
necessary capabilities for the Singapore Air Force (SAF) to fulfill
its missions effectively to ensure the security of Singapore.</P>
      <P>One such capability is attack helicopters, which he said, fits in
well with the development of the SAF into a modern and balanced
force.</P>
      <P>The SAFE will proceed to acquire a small number of attack
helicopters and will be calling tenders in the coming months, he told
the audience, which mostly included representatives from several of
the world's leading military and commercial aircraft manufacturers.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT OFFICIAL LEAVES FOR SEOUL TO ATTEND PRESIDENTIAL INAUGURATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  24  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>John Chang, secretary-general of the
Republic of China's ruling Kuomintang, left for Seoul on Tuesday to
attend the inauguration ceremony for South Korean President-elect Kim
Dae-jung.</P>
      <P>KMT sources said Chang will occupy a very conspicuous seat at
Wednesday's ceremony, in an indication of the great importance South
Korea attaches to its ties with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>This is Chang's second trip to South Korea so far this month. He
headed a high-level KMT delegation to Seoul on Feb. 11-14. During
that visit, Chang met with South Korean Prime Minister-designate Kim
Jong-pil, Parliamentarians Soon Se-il and Lew Sing-soo and several
other influential figures of various political stripes.</P>
      <P>However, Chang failed to meet South Korean President-elect Kim
because of strong pressure from Beijing. Kim later apologized for the
cancellation of their scheduled meeting through one of his close
aides. The aide also asked Chang to forward a personal letter from
Kim to ROC President Lee Teng-hui, who concurrently serves as KMT
chairman.</P>
      <P>Chang, a career diplomat, had been minister of foreign affairs
before assuming his current post late last year. Chang once said he
will actively promote the KMT's relations with major political
parties of other countries as part of Taiwan's pragmatic diplomacy
drive.</P>
      <P>Taiwan-South Korean relations have been at a low ebb since the
two countries cut diplomatic ties in August 1992. Senior officials of
both countries have expressed a desire to improve bilateral relations
after the inauguration of the new Korean president.</P>
      <P>Chang said prior to his departure that the two countries should
work hand in hand to improve bilateral ties based on the principles
of equality and reciprocity. "With sincerity and good will, I
believe many problems can be resolved smoothly and satisfactorily,"
he added.</P>
      <P>South Korea has called for resumption of direct flight
services between the two countries, which have been suspended
since the break of bilateral diplomatic ties. ROC Foreign Ministry
officials said the airlinks can be resumed only on a reciprocal
basis.</P>
      <P>Chang is scheduled to return to Taipei on Wednesday evening.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FAR EAST PILOT SUSPENDED AFTER ACCIDENT</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The pilot of a Far East Air Transport plane
which skidded off the runway at Taipei's domestic airport was
suspended from duty for one month, airline officials said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The Boeing 757, carrying 126 passengers, took off from Taiwan's
southern city of Kaohsiung at 11:05 a.m. and landed at the Sungshan
Airport in Taipei at 11:55 a.m., when the mishap happened. No one was
injured in the incident.</P>
      <P>Although the mishap could be partially attributed to slippery
conditions on the runway due to steady rainfall over the past few
days, investigators from the Civil Aeronautics Administration said
pilot Hung Kuei-chih failed to follow standard procedure by slowing
down the plane sufficiently after it touched down.</P>
      <P>Far East officials said that Hung will be demoted to co-pilot
for six months, effective Tuesday. He will be reinstated in his
former position after six months only if he satisfactorily completes
a series of tests.</P>
      <P>The Boeing 757, which was slightly damaged in the accident, has
been grounded for maintenance and repair work.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A semiconductor manufacturing company in
Taoyuan County, some 30 kilometers south of Taipei, was robbed of
more than 3 million computer memory chips late Monday night, police
said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for Expeditors Co. in Taoyuan's Luchu township said
the stolen memory chips were valued an estimated NT$1 billion
(US$30.3 million).</P>
      <P>The spokesman said three armed men, donning raincoats and wearing
gloves, broke into the company's offices at around 11:20 p.m. The
robbers attacked Ho Yu-tang, an Expeditors department chief, cutting
him with hunting knives and forcing him to open a guarded warehouse.
They soon made away with more than 3 million memory chips.</P>
      <P>During the attack, Ho sustained injuries to his chin and ears. In
addition, the assailants tied his limbs with ropes before fleeing. Ho
reported the case to police authorities Tuesday morning, immediately
after he managed to break free.</P>
      <P>Ho told police the intruders spoke in the Taiwanese dialect. But,
as he was traumatized during the ordeal, Ho was unable to give an
accurate physical description of the three men.</P>
      <P>Police have formed a special task force to investigate the
incident. A senior officer said he is confident the case can be
broken as all the missing chips were marked with a model or batch
number.</P>
      <P>This was the second theft of memory chips reported here in less
than a month. On Feb. 2, United Test Center in the Hsinchu
Science-based Industrial Park in northern Taiwan was also robbed of
US$5 million worth of synchronous dynamic random access memory
(SDRAM) chips. At least eight suspects involved in the case have
been arrested.</P>

      <P>Premier Vincent Siew said on Tuesday that
President Lee Teng-hui's planned visit to Africa next month is still
under assessment.</P>
      <P>He was responding to an interpellation by Legislator Chen Hung-ki

      <P>Siew said that, according to diplomatic protocol and procedures,
visits by heads of state are announced only after the foreign affairs
ministries from the relevant countries have confirmed all details
regarding the trips.</P>
      <P>The premier indicated that President Lee's trip is still on the
drawing board and has yet to be finalized.</P>
      <P>He also said that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is still
assessing whether the president will visit all nine African nations
that currently maintain diplomatic relations with the Republic of
China, or only some of those countries.</P>
      <P>Officials from the Presidential Office said on Tuesday that
Foreign Minister Jason Hu, who returned from a whirlwind six-nation

    <HEADLINE>AUSSIE PM SKEPTICAL ABOUT UN-IRAQI AGREEMENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Feb.  24  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australian Prime Minister John Howard,
who has echoed the United States' cautious skepticism to the Middle
East peace agreement signed between the United Nations and Iraq, has
said Australia will keep its elite troops in the Persian Gulf region
on standby.</P>
      <P>Howard said Monday night that until details of the agreement were
known and Saddam Hussein's intentions had been tested, he would
support a continued allied military presence in the Gulf region.</P>
      <P>The agreement has described been as a diplomatic breakthrough
because it allows UN inspectors to unconditionally resume the search
for Iraq's biological and chemical weapons.</P>
      <P>Howard urged the United Nations to carry out inspections to the
fullest extent as soon as possible and said Australian Special Air
Service (SAS) troops would remain beyond the initial deployment
period of three months if necessary.</P>
      <P>"I think if we have got an agreement which allows inspections, I
think that agreement should be tested to the fullest extent possible,
as soon as possible," he said.</P>
      <P>"It is only then we'll be satisfied, and I would never rely on
Saddam Hussein's word until we do that. I would imagine that if it is
everything that people are suggesting it is, then it would be tested
by a full-scale inspection very soon, and unless -- and until -- that
inspection is successfully carried out, there should be no withdrawal
of forces," he said.</P>
      <P>Howard said he expected the same kind of conditions on the length
of the Australian military deployment would also apply to the US and
British deployments.</P>
      <P>The Australian National Security Committee is expected to hold a
meeting Tuesday to consider the results of UN Secretary-General Kofi
Annan's mission to Baghdad and to confirm the continuing presence of
the 110 SAS troops and two Boeing 707 air refueling aircraft and
their crews in the Gulf.</P>
      <P>Defense sources here said the decision to leave troops in place
was influenced by fears that Iraq may once again try to frustrate the
weapons inspection work of the UN Special Commission if the threat of
military retaliation is removed.</P>
      <P>Howard said if war were avoided, "it will forever be to the
credit of the United States and her allies, such as Australia and

    <TEXT>
      <P>Three out of every four newly arrived
migrants do not know that the Australian government bans them from
claiming welfare benefits for two years, according to a new survey.</P>
      <P>The survey shows nearly 60 percent of new migrants said they had
no knowledge of the government's two-year waiting period for migrants
until they actually arrived in Australia.</P>
      <P>Another 15 percent did not discover they had no right to welfare
until they visited a social security office, according to the survey
by the New South Wales Ethnic Communities Council in Sydney.</P>
      <P>The study, which interviewed 95 new migrants from 22 different
cultural backgrounds, found only 24 percent knew of the two-year
waiting period before they arrived in Australia.</P>
      <P>Lawyers, welfare workers, academics and ethnic community leaders
gathered together in a meeting in Sydney on Monday to outline
strategies for a campaign to pressure the Australian government to
amend the controversial migrant welfare legislation introduced in
March 1997.</P>
      <P>The measure was introduced in order to stem new migrants from
claiming social welfare because the government, which is trying to
reduce its budget deficit and cut down Australia's US$146 billion
foreign debt, is under financial constraints.</P>

migrants access to special benefits -- a payment of A$290 (US$192)
each fortnight for a destitute adult -- was particularly harsh.</P>
      <P>"This government is making people face destitution when they
arrive in Australia," a center spokeswoman said.</P>
      <P>In 1997-98, the Australian government will sharply reduce its
immigration quota to about 68,000, down from nearly 100,000 in
1996-97.</P>
      <P>Most migrants coming to Australia from Taiwan, Japan, Hong Kong
and South Korea are business migrants, bringing lots of money. But
those coming from Eastern Europe, Vietnam, mainland China, the
Philippines and Indochina are more often either skilled workers or
relatives for family reunions.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ORDERS RECEIVED BY TAIWAN EXPORTERS DOWN IN JANUARY</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The value of orders received by Taiwan
exporters in January totaled US$8,460 million, a drop of 14.28
percent from a year earlier, according to statistics released Monday
by the Ministry of Economic Affairs.</P>
      <P>The statistics showed that the value of January orders from the
United States totaled US$2,850 million, an increase of 4.05 percent,
while the value of orders from Hong Kong in the month dropped 30.21
percent to US$1,260 million. The value of orders from Japan and
Europe also plunged 28.92 percent and 1.83 percent respectively from
January, 1997.</P>
      <P>The value of orders received in January for transportation,
information and communications equipment was higher than a year
earlier, the statistics showed.</P>
      <P>The number of working days in last month was five less than a
year ago, because the Chinese New Year fell in January this year.
This may be attributable to the reduction in the value of export
orders received last month, an official of the ministry said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EPA DENIES DECLARING RCA PREMISES PERMANENTLY CONTAMINATED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 24 (CNA)
(By Lin Wen-fen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Environmental Protection Administration
(EPA) on Tuesday denied a local news report that a parcel of land in
Taoyuan County, northern Taiwan, that was previously the site of an
RCA electronics plant has been declared permanently contaminated.</P>
      <P>The EPA released a statement that it had never made any such
announcement, saying that a program to decontaminate the water below
the site of the deserted RCA factory is still in progress.</P>
      <P>It said that the final determination on the effectiveness of the
program launched by the US-based General Electric (GE) Co. and
French-based Thomson Corp. to rid the underground water of toxic
substances is scheduled to be made in June.</P>
      <P>If the clean-up is unsuccessful and the land is declared
permanently contaminated, this would be the first case of its kind in
Taiwan. Permanently contaminated land cannot be put to residential or
business use.</P>
      <P>The EPA said that it has received the report submitted by the GE
and Thomson work team regarding the results of the six-month clean-up
program. The EPA is reviewing the report and studying several
possible remedies to the pollution problem.</P>
      <P>RCA established a production center for the manufacture of
electronics and electric home appliances on the 23.71 acres of land
in Taoyuan in 1970. GE took over the plant's operations in 1986. Two
years later, the operation went to Thomson.</P>
      <P>The land currently belongs to two local companies -- Hong Yi and
Chang Chung, which purchased it for some NT$1.6 billion (US$48.8
million) several years ago.</P>
      <P>The two Taiwan companies applied to rezone the industrial land
for business and residential use not long before the land purchase.
But the application was put on hold in 1994 when reports emerged that
RCA had dumped toxic waste into wells on the land for nearly 20
years, seriously contaminating the area.</P>
      <P>The United Daily News reported in its Tuesday edition that
according to the report submitted by the GE and Thomson team, the EPA
has decided that the clean-up program was futile and that the area
should be declared permanently contaminated. It quoted Chang
Ching-feng, a high-ranking official at the EPA's Water Quality
Protection Bureau, as saying that the clean-up program was a failure.</P>
      <P>The report also said that the two local companies have filed
suits against GE and Thomson in New York and Paris, respectively,
accusing the two giants of tricking them into buying the land by not
informing them of the contamination.</P>
      <P>According to the mass-circulation newspaper, Professor Yeh
Hong-teh of National Chiao Tung University said that an EPA survey
made in 1994 showed that the water below the RCA premises contained
930 parts per billion (ppb) of trichloro-ethylene, compared with 5
ppb allowable in drinking water. The latest survey, conducted after
the completion of a six-month clean-up program, showed samples of the
underground water containing an even higher level of
trichloro-ethylene than in the previous study.</P>
      <P>Professor Chen Chai-hsun of National Central University said that
trichloro-ethylene and tetrachloro-ethylene are both considered
"DNAPL," meaning that the toxicants are difficult to get rid of.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER VINCENT SIEW WELCOMES ARATS MESSAGE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 24 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Premier Vincent Siew said
on Tuesday he welcomed a letter from mainland China concerning the
resumption of dialogue across the Taiwan Strait and exchanges of
visits by officials of the two cross-strait intermediary bodies,
Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) and its mainland
counterpart the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait
(ARATS).</P>
      <P>Siew made the remarks in response to an interpellation by
Legislator Lee You-chi of the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) about a letter
from the ARATS saying it would welcome a visit at the appropriate
time by SEF Chairman C. F. Koo.</P>
      <P>The letter, which was sent to the SEF, said the ARATS would
welcome a visit by Koo for political talks. It also proposed
working-level exchange visits by SEF and ARATS officials to discuss
procedural issues related to the opening of political talks, as well
as the resumption of consultations on economic and administrative
issues.</P>
      <P>Siew said he welcomed the ARATS' positive response to a
Taiwan-proposed resumption of regular cross-strait dialogue and
exchanges of visits by officials of the two intermediary bodies.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Siew said, the agenda proposed by the ARATS still
differs from the SEF-proposed one on certain points. "We need further
study to understand the ARATS' true intention and stance," Siew said,
adding he has asked the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC) and the SEF to address the issue. The MAC supervises SEF
operations.</P>
      <P>Siew also echoed the ARATS' call for exchanges of visits by SEF
and ARATS officials at the appropriate level. "I hope the SEF will
draw up detailed plans for boosting such exchanges."</P>
      <P>The SEF and ARATS are semi-official bodies founded by their
respective governments to handle cross-strait exchanges in the
absence of official ties.</P>
      <P>The SEF sent letters to the ARATS on Nov. 7 and Jan. 19,
suggesting that SEF Chairman Koo visit the mainland to restart
institutionalized technical talks broken off by Beijing in mid-1995.
The ARATS didn't formally respond to the proposal until Tuesday.</P>
      <P>While Taiwan does not oppose talks on any topic that can
contribute to harmonious development and the eventual reunification
of China under freedom and democracy, it has stressed that
cross-strait talks on practical issues should be resumed first under
the framework laid out in the first meeting between Koo and ARATS
Chairman Wang Daohan in Singapore in 1993.</P>

the Boeing Company, one of world's largest commercial aircraft
makers, marking a significant step forward for Taiwan's bid to enter
the international aviation market.</P>
      <P>AIDC Chairman Tsai Chun-hui made the announcement on Tuesday at
the Singapore Aviation Show, which kicked off here that day.</P>
      <P>Tsai told the press that his company has been contracted to
manufacture nine different parts and components for Boeing B-777
aircraft. The multi-million US dollar contract makes AIDC the first

prior to a formal contract signing ceremony between April and May.</P>
      <P>AIDC, which has its headquarters in northern Taiwan's Hsinchu

    <TEXT>Multinational conglomerate KG Investment
Co., in which Taiwan's Koo Group is a major player, is to purchase
shares in a Thai financial organization which has hit dire straits
since the eruption last July of the financial turmoil that has swept
the countries of Southeast Asia.

Thailand's largest securities company -- Securities One Plc.
(S-One) announced on Tuesday that its board of directors decided in a
meeting on Monday to sell nearly 50 percent of the company to KG
Investment.

The S-One will sell 420 million shares to KG Investment at 5 baht
per share, a price that is nearly four times lower than the market
price. At the close of the Thai stock market on Monday, S-One shares
were worth 19.5 baht each.

The move is part of S-One's efforts to increase its capital from
the current level of 1.47 billion baht to 8.47 billion baht.

The financial crisis caused S-One to lose 5.2 billion baht-worth
of assets last year, while the depreciation of Thailand's currency
cost the company another 789 million baht. The company also lost 2.9
billion baht in its stock market investments and 569 million baht in
marginal trade loans which it has been unable to retrieve.

KG Investment is a multinational conglomerate comprising Taiwan's
Koo Group, Japan's Nippon Life Insurance, South Korea's Tong Yang
Group, Singapore's Lee Kim Yem Ltd., Indonesia's Salim Group, the
Philippines' Yuchengoo Group and mainland China's Citic Group.

Koo Chung-yun, president of KG Investment said that investment

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Some 5,000 medical practitioners and
pharmacists from around the island protested in front of the
Legislative Yuan on Tuesday to voice their concerns over their rights
to prescribe and dispense medicine.</P>
      <P>The doctors, dressed in their professional whites, were demanding
the return of their dispensation rights which they have been deprived
of since about one year ago.</P>
      <P>They demanded the legislature to revise the Pharmacy Law so as to
allow the Taiwan public the choice of obtaining medicine either from
medical institutions and clinics or from pharmacies.</P>
      <P>The current law, revised last year, gives doctors the right to
prescribe medicine but not to dispense it.</P>
      <P>The doctors said their demonstration will continue for three
days, and they did not exclude the possibility of dropping out of the
National Health Insurance program en masse if their demands are not
met.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, pharmacists were also asking for the return of their
prescription rights, since they claimed there are still many doctors
who refuse to release prescriptions to patients.</P>
      <P>The pharmacists accused some doctors of prescribing low-cost
medicines in order to reap illegal profits, which they allege
infringes upon patients' rights.</P>
      <P>They argued that one major advantage of obtaining medicine from
pharmacies is that pharmacists may double check to see if doctors'
prescriptions are adequate.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the confrontation between medical practitioners and
pharmacists, Taiwan's top health official, Chan Chi-hsien, urged the
two opposition camps to keep in mind that the interests of the public
should be the only ultimate goal of their services.</P>
      <P>Chan, director-general of the Department of Health, said any
party who threatens to cease their operations because their demands
are not met will be duly dealt with.</P>
      <P>He stressed that while interests can be negotiated, policies can
be reviewed and laws can be revised, patients' rights are not
negotiable.</P>
      <P>The separation of prescribing and dispensing is the law and an
established policy, Chan noted, adding that the government will not
sit idly by and watch patients' rights be infringed upon.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government-funded Institute
for Information Industry (III) on Tuesday refuted a US allegation
that Taiwan has not done enough to eliminate commercial piracy.</P>
      <P>The US-based International Intellectual Property Alliance (IIPA)
has asked the Office of the US Trade Representative (USTR) to
put Taiwan on a Special 301 "watch list" again because it has
regressed in intellectual property rights (IPR) protection and in
crackdown on computer software piracy.</P>
      <P>"The IIPA allegation is unfair," Chen Chia-chun, director of
the III's legal service center, said, adding that Taiwan's
law-enforcement officers have broken more than 200 computer software
piracy cases and destroyed more than 100,000 pirated CD-ROMs and
video game software over the past year.</P>
      <P>Chen said Taiwan has done its utmost to crack down on software
piracy. Nevertheless, he admitted that Taiwan should still intensify
publicity campaign to help its people understand the importance of
IPR protection.</P>
      <P>Chen pointed out that Taiwan's software industry has not grown as
fast as its hardware industry partly because of rampant piracy. "We
should teach our people the importance to respect and protect
intellectual property rights in order to boost scientific and
technological development."</P>
      <P>Reports from Washington said the IIPA claimed that Taiwan
remains a pivot in entertainment software piracy in the three
Chinese economies -- Taiwan, Hong Kong and mainland China. It
further said pirated CD-ROMs, CDs and music recordings remain
rampant in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The IIPA, composed of 1,350 US-based movie, music and computer
software companies, claimed that American companies lost an
estimated US$237.2 million in software sales last year due to
counterfeiting by Taiwan firms. The amount marked a 5.4 percent
decline from the 1996 level.</P>
      <P>The USTR has made an annual review on how US copyrights, patents
and trademarks are being protected around the world since 1989 in
accordance the Special 301 provisions of the Omnibus US Trade Act. It
has consistently unveiled lists of countries for different degrees of
US moniotring to imporve IPR protection at the end of April annually.</P>
      <P>Taiwan was placed on the "priority watch list" in 1989; on the
"watch list" in 1990 and 1991; on the most threatening "priority
foreign countries" in 1992; on the "priority watch list" in 1993; on
the "watch list" in 1994-5; and on the least-threatening "special
mention" list in 1996. Due to its progress in IPR protection and
nationwide crackdown on commercial piracy, Taiwan has managed to
graduate from any "Special 301" watch list since November 1996.</P>
      <P>Economics Ministry officials said the ministry will intensify
cooperation with law-enforcement authorities to wipe out IPR
infringement in order to protect national image and reduce trade
frictions with major trade partners, particularly the US.</P>

      <P>Negotiators from Taiwan and the 15-member
European Union (EU) started a new round of talks in Taipei on
Tuesday on terms for the island's entry into the World Trade
Organization (WTO).</P>
      <P>The two sides first discussed issues related to Taiwan's service
market opening measures and have reached consensus on almost all
major problems, said Schive Chi, vice chairman of the Council for
Economic Planning and Development (CEPD).</P>
      <P>Schive said Taiwan has agreed to allow foreign nationals to set
up wholly-owned air cargo forwarding companies in Taiwan on a
reciprocal basis following its WTO entry. At present, foreign
nationals can only hold a maximum 50 percent stake in such a company
in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Taiwan also promised to review in three years its current
regulation that a foreign lawyer must have five years of
professional experience before he or she will be allowed to
practice in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taiwan promised to allow foreign investors to invest
up to 60 percent in local telecommunications companies after it is
firmally admitted to the Geneva-based world trade regulatory body.</P>
      <P>Schive also explained to EU officials that Taiwan will no
longer issue operating permits for any new trust investment
companies.</P>
      <P>The two sides will discuss topics related to Taiwan's tariff
reduction plans for automobiles, tobacco, alchol and other
industrial goods as well as liberalization of its government
procurement system in the next two days.</P>
      <P>The EU delegation to the current round of talks is headed by
Jean-Pierre de Laet, deputy head of the EU unit in charge of WTO
negotiations with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The EU is one of the two remaining trade partners that have yet

is Switzerland.</P>
      <P>Chen Ruey-long, director-general of the Board of Foreign Trade,
said Taiwan hopes to finalize all bilateral talks with its
major trade partners before the end of March in order to speed up
its WTO accession.</P>
      <P>If all goes smoothly, the WTO working party in charge of
Taiwan's membership application will begin to draft Taiwan's entry

    <TEXT>
      <P>China Development Corp. (CDC), a business
arm of the Republic of China's ruling Kuomintang (KMT), has decided
to establish an investment and trust fund in South Korea aimed at
investing directly in the East Asian country.</P>
      <P>The fund, initially to be valued at 10 billion Korean won
(US$6.02 million), will share investment from CDC and a number of
Korean businesses and banking companies, with CDC contributing 70
percent of the paid-in investment and the Korean companies
responsible for the remaining 30 percent, said Liu Tai-ying, chairman
of the KMT Business Management Committee.</P>
      <P>Liu said CDC decided to pitch into South Korea's business and
industrial sectors because the company has found that Korean
attitudes toward foreign investment have changed remarkably in the
wake of the Asian financial turmoil which has affected South Korea
particularly badly and the intervention of the International Monetary
Fund to bail the nation out from possible economic disaster.</P>
      <P>According to Liu, he and CDC President Hu Ting-wu visited South
Korea many times to tap the feasibility of investing in that country
before making the decision.</P>
      <P>The CDC-initiated fund will initially target South Korea's
high-technology industries, including personal computer, software and
precision machinery manufacturing. The investment foray could also
include the financial and banking sectors if assessments find these
sectors viable, Liu noted.</P>
      <P>Hu is leaving for Seoul on Wednesday to meet Korean business and
industrial leaders for discussions on possible investment projects.</P>
      <P>However, the widely-reported possible CDC investment in
Korean-Asian Airlines is now history because the airlines' financial
situation is too difficult to tackle, said Hu.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP CHAIRMAN PREPARING FOR 2000 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  24 (CNA)
(By Bear Lee)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Chairman Hsu Hsin-liang of the opposition
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) on Tuesday made public his
intention of running in the Republic of China's next presidential
election, slated for 2000.</P>
      <P>"I am preparing for 2000," Hsu said in response to a question
raised after he delivered a speech at the European Council of
Commerce and Trade (ECCT) in Taipei.</P>
      <P>The questioner had asked what Hsu intends to do after he resigns
as DPP chairman.</P>
      <P>In his speech entitled "DPP Policies on Taiwan's Economic
Development and Relations with China," Hsu painted a picture of the
Taiwan of tomorrow as an island with a more open economy, a more
mature and stable democracy, and improved relations with mainland
China.</P>
      <P>He stressed the need for a thorough internationalization and
liberalization of Taiwan's economy and wider opening of its financial
sector.</P>
      <P>The DPP chairman said that although his party represents the
interests of Taiwan, it should also comply with international
political and economic order while pursuing its goals.</P>
      <P>He also explained to his audience the DPP consensus of
"consolidating the base (Taiwan) first and engaging gradually with
the mainland," which was reached at a recent inner-party debate on
policy towards mainland China.</P>
      <P>He said that his party will not seek to declare Taiwan
independence since Taiwan is already a sovereign independent country.</P>
      <P>"Our foremost priority is to maintain peace across the Taiwan
Strait, and as long as the status quo serves the interests of
regional peace and stability, we will not initiate any declaration.
We believe that in this way our security is guaranteed, for the
international community would not tolerate China's unprovoked
aggression against Taiwan," he said.</P>
      <P>Hsu agreed with calls made by the international community that
now is the right time for Taiwan and the mainland to resume talks
which have been suspended since 1995.</P>
      <P>"Besides the issue of sovereignty, we are willing to enter into
comprehensive talks with China to address issues of mutual concern.
We also want to encourage cultural and economic exchanges to enhance
cross-strait peace and understanding."</P>
      <P>Hsu, who was recently forced to drop his earlier advocacy of
"boldly marching towards the west" mainland policy after being
criticized by his comrades, said that he is still personally in favor
of lifting government regulations and limitations on trade with the
mainland to increase cross-strait trade links.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EVA, GE ESTABLISH JOINT-VENTURE FOR AIRPLANE MAINTENANCE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>CKS  Airport, Feb. 24 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>EVA Airways Corporation of Taiwan and
General Electric Aircraft Engines (GE) of the United States on
Tuesday formally signed a NT$2.5 billion (US$76.22 million) joint
venture for aircraft maintenance and repair.</P>
      <P>A contract signing ceremony was held at an EVA engine facility at
Chiang Kai-shek (CKS) International Airport in Taoyuan, some 40 km
west of the Taiwan capital of Taipei.</P>
      <P>The joint venture, which will have its headquarters near the
airport, will build various maintenance and engine overhaul
facilities, an EVA spokesman said, noting that the deal will enable
Taiwan to provide a complete maintenance center for carriers with
fleets in the Asia-Pacific region.</P>
      <P>The newly formed Evergreen Aviation Technologies Corporation, 80
percent owned by EVA and 20 percent owned by GE, will operate an
already completed turbine test facility which can test jet engines
generating up to 120,000 pounds of thrust, as well as conducting
engine overhauls, said the spokesman.</P>
      <P>He added that besides the company's mission of improving the
island's capability in aircraft and engine repair and maintenance,
the joint-venture is also committed to engage in the development and
manufacture of engine products, leading EVA into the field of
aviation manufacture.</P>
      <P>In view of this commitment, GE will contribute technology
transfers to the joint-venture, which could be ready to begin
production of aircraft spares after five years, according to EVA.</P>
      <P>The Evergreen Group, the Taiwan-based shipping giant, began
business in the aviation services sector in 1994 through the
establishment of EVA Airways, which now possesses a 32-plane fleet.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EXCHANGES BETWEEN SEF AND ARATS SHOULD BE PRIORITY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  24 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>If Beijing really wants to resume contact
with Taipei, it should start with exchanges between the two front
agencies set up by each side to deal with the other, said Chang
King-yuh, chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC), on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>In response to questions from an opposition legislator, Chang
said at the Legislative Yuan that exchanges of visits between
personnel of Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) and Beijing's
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS), should
take place prior to any visit to mainland China by SEF Chairman Koo
Chen-fu or formal negotiations between the two agencies.</P>
      <P>Chang lauded ARATS' letter to the SEF which arrived on Tuesday in
which it suggested a reopening of dialogue with the SEF as a positive
response to Republic of China Premier Vincent Siew's friendly gesture
toward Beijing made in a statement to the Legislature on the
administration's agenda last Friday.</P>
      <P>In his analysis, Chang said the ARATS intended to contact its
Taiwan counterpart on economic, working, and procedural issues
pending a mandate from the Beijing authorities.</P>
      <P>This, he said, can be seen from the first paragraph of the
letter, which says the two agencies could restart negotiations on
economic and working-level issues as well as on the procedure for
political talks, once they are given the go-ahead to do so.</P>
      <P>The second paragraph of the letter, urging exchanges between the
SEF and the ARATS, is an echo of what Taipei has always called for,
said Chang.</P>
      <P>The third paragraph, which says the ARATS would welcome a visit
by Koo to mainland China "when the time is appropriate," is a reply
to a suggestion made by Taipei earlier this year that Koo make such a
visit, according to Chang.</P>
      <P>Hailing the letter as a welcome movement on the part of the
ARATS, Chang emphasized the importance of order and prudence in
cross-strait exchanges.</P>
      <P>Although Siew pledged in his agenda statement on Friday that his
administration would like to negotiate with Beijing on anything which
might help cross-strait relations and contribute to the democratic
unification of the two sides, Chang said that priority should be
given to issues concerning the exchanges themselves, on which
consensus already exists.</P>
      <P>In a related development on Tuesday, Koo said he also welcomed
the ARATS suggestion for expanded dialogue with the SEF, calling it a
positive response to Siew's friendly gesture toward Beijing.</P>

    <DATELINE>Rome,  Feb.  24  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Holy See fully supports the peaceful
resolution to differences between the archrivals across the Taiwan
Strait, the Vatican's secretary of state, Cardinal Angelo Sodano,
said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Sodano, who met on Tuesday with Huang Kun-huei, secretary-general
to President Lee Teng-hui of the Republic of China, for an hour-long
discussion, said he greatly admires Lee for his promotion of
"spiritual reform" in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Sodano said that while Europe, even the entire world, is sinking
in the materialist quicksand in which spiritual values are bankrupt,
spiritual reform like that inspired by Lee is highly commendable,
since it is in line with what the Pope has called for in terms of
ethics and moral values.</P>
      <P>Huang for his part told Sodano that the ROC government is always
willing to pitch in to help international charities and to provide
aid to refugees around the world. These gestures of goodwill,
however, have often been barred because of political interference, he
lamented.</P>
      <P>Sodano, on behalf of the Vatican, expressed hope that the
spiritual center of the 1.1 billion Roman Catholics worldwide should
work closely with Taiwan in international aid efforts on a
politics-free and borderless basis.</P>
      <P>Huang meanwhile expressed Taiwan's gratitude to the Pope for
elevating Archbishop Paul K.H. Shan of Kaohsiung as one of 22 new
cardinals from around the world.</P>
      <P>Huang arrived in the Vatican on Saturday to witness the elevation
ceremony. During his stay in Vatican City, he was granted an audience
with the Pope, when he conveyed President Lee's greetings to the
leader of the world's Roman Catholics.</P>

(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Eyeing mushrooming travel opportunities
emerging from the five-day workweek that Taiwan began at the start of
this year, Japan Asia Airways (JAA) in Taipei will open passenger
flights between Kaohsiung and Okinawa, according to the Japanese
company.</P>
      <P>JAA said that it will inaugurate two regular round-trip flight
services per week between the Japanese island resort, southwest of
Japan's Kyushu, and Kaohsiung, in southern Taiwan, in April.</P>
      <P>The chartered flight services will be on a trial basis until
October, when the carrier will decide whether or not to maintain the
new route based on market demand, a JAA executive stationed in
Kaohsiung revealed Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The executive noted the new flight project was prompted by the
facts that most of their flight services bound to Japan enjoyed high
passenger carrying rates during this year's winter-holiday season and
that some 40 percent of their customers were from southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He stressed the direct flight between Kaohsiung and Okinawa,
which will take only half of the time of a flight through northern
Taiwan's Chiang Kai-shek International Airport, is expected to help
enhance the airline's competitiveness in Taiwan's emerging tourism
sector.</P>

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A batch of computer memory chips that
have been in police custody since early this month have been
identified as stolen from Intel's manufacturing plant in Malaysia,
Kaohsiung police said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The 11,530 chips, packaged in four cartons, arrived at Kaohsiung
International Airport from Malaysia in early February, marked as
being for Kaohsiung resident Su Yi-jen, 30.</P>
      <P>The Kaohsiung Customs Bureau became suspicious about the chips
because although they were labeled as being from Intel, they bore no
model or batch numbers. The bureau seized the chips for further
investigation.</P>
      <P>After some two weeks of contacts with Intel's Taiwan operations
and relevant investigations, the bureau was informed that the same
amount of memory chips was stolen from the Intel plant in Malaysia
about one month ago.</P>
      <P>Questioned by Kaohsiung airport police, Su, the consignee of the
chips, said that he bought the chips from an overseas Chinese
surnamed Ma in Malaysia at 30 US cents apiece. Su said he intended to
extract the gold in the chips and that he didn't know they had been
stolen.</P>
      <P>The police later found that Su operates a small IC plant in
Kaohsiung.</P>

    <DATELINE>Beijing, Feb. 25 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Beijing would prefer to have those on both
sides of the Taiwan Strait responsible for the day-to-day workings of
the bodies related to cross-strait affairs resume their dialogue
before higher-level officials resume theirs, according to mainland
officials related to Taiwan affairs.</P>
      <P>In other words, Beijing would like to hold a meeting between Shi
Hwei-yow, vice chairman and secretary-general of the Taipei-based
Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), and his counterpart Tang Shubei,
vice chairman of the Beijing-based Association for Relations Across
the Taiwan Strait (ARATS), prior to SEF Chairman Koo Chen-fu's visit
to Beijing.</P>
      <P>In a letter it faxed to the SEF on Tuesday, ARATS said it hopes
to further expand exchanges between both sides in advance of
discussions on procedural matters related to the holding of
cross-strait political negotiations, adding that it is open to
discussions on the level and issues of these exchanges.</P>
      <P>The mainland welcomes Koo's visit, said a related Taiwan affairs
official who insisted on remaining anonymous. Since the visit,
however, will inevitably involve the issue of resuming the talks
between Koo and his mainland counterpart, Wang Daohan, contact
between the SEF and ARATS at an "appropriate level" is necessary, he
added.</P>
      <P>Asked what is regarded as appropriate, the official remarked that
ARATS wrote the SEF on Nov. 6, 1997, inviting Chiao Jen-ho, then vice
chairman and secretary-general of the SEF, to the mainland. Taipei,
however, rejected that invitation.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIPEI MAYOR NOT TO RUN FOR DPP CHAIRMANSHIP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  25  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Chen Shui-bian announced on
Wednesday that he will not run for chairmanship of the Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP), Taiwan's largest opposition party.</P>
      <P>Chen told a news conference that he will continue to concentrate
on performing his mayoral duties. "I'll dedicate myself to playing
the role the people of Taiwan expect of me," said the charismatic
mayor of Taiwan's largest city.</P>
      <P>The pro-independence party is scheduled to elect a new chairman
in May. Incumbent DPP Chairman Hsu Hsin-liang has said he will not
seek reelection. Some DPP politicians originally expected Chen to run
for the post in order to lead the opposition party to power.</P>
      <P>Chen said he had made extensive consultations and had given the
matter careful consideration before making his decision.</P>
      <P>Noting that the 10-year-old DPP is now at a critical juncture in
its bid to become the country's ruling power, Chen said that what the
DPP badly needs at the moment is a sense of esprit de corps and
humility, not "personal heroism" or individualism.</P>
      <P>During the course of his consultations, Chen said he found that
many of his DPP colleagues and friends have high expectations of him.
"I think at the moment I should modestly shelve my own personal
career plan and devote all of my energy to upgrading municipal
administrative work in order to make the Taipei City Government a
shining beacon that will attract more popular confidence in and
support of the DPP."</P>
      <P>Chen didn't formally announce his bid to seek reelection as
Taipei City mayor, saying only that he will "certainly go to the
DPP's Taipei office to pick up application forms for joining a
primary election for selecting the party's candidate for the year-end
mayoral election." The DPP will accept registrations from March 2
through March 6 for the primaries to select candidates for the next
Taipei and Kaohsiung mayoral elections and for the Legislative Yuan
elections scheduled for later this year.</P>
      <P>Chen was accompanied at the news conference by his mentor,
Professor Lee Hung-hsi of National Taiwan University, and leaders of
the major DPP factions, all of whom threw their support behind Chen's
decision to stay out of the DPP chairman election.</P>
      <P>Legislator Chang Chun-hsiung, head of the DPP's Welfare State
faction, lauded Chen's decision as "wise and correct." He further
pointed out that the most important thing for Chen at the moment is
to win reelection as mayor of Taipei. "Whether Chen can be reelected
Taipei mayor will be an important indicator to gauge whether the DPP
will be able to come to power in the early years of the next
century," he said.</P>
      <P>As the next DPP chairman will have to lead the party through this
year's three elections and the 2000 presidential election, Chang said
he hopes the major factions will jointly recommend a mutually
acceptable candidate to run in the chairmanship election. According
to DPP regulations, the party's chairman should be elected by all of
its members.</P>
      <P>Chang denied that he will seek the party's leadership post as
Chen's surrogate. "Such a rumor is an insult to both me and Chen," he
asserted, adding that he has yet to decide whether to join the race
for the party chairmanship.</P>
      <P>To date, only Lin Yi-hsiung, a former Taiwan Provincial Assembly
deputy, and Legislator Yen Chin-fu, have explicitly expressed their
intentions to run for the top DPP post.</P>
      <P>Incumbent DPP Secretary-General Chiou Yi-jen said Chen's decision
to stay out of the race has made the prospects for the chairmanship
election even more uncertain. Chen is widely believed to be the
strongest competitor for the post.</P>

      <P>"Taiwan's economy is alive and well. This
has important lessons for its neighbors," said Frank Altschul,
professor of International Economics at Yale University.</P>
      <P>Contributing an article to the Financial Times, Altschul pointed
out that in the midst of all the discussion of Asia's financial
crisis, there has been very little mention of one place: Taiwan.
Although historically it has been considered a virtually identical
twin of South Korea, Taiwan has been little affected, he noted.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has been relatively untouched by the contagion that has
spread to almost all emerging countries, including those as far away
as Brazil and Russia, he said, noting that the island's growth rate
has remained fairly steady at more than 6 percent, inflation in 1997
was less than 1 percent, its currency has fallen by only 12 percent
over the past three months and its stock market actually rose by 8
percent in 1997, though it has fallen back somewhat in the first
weeks of this year.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan economy has continued to perform remarkably well and
confidence has remained high even though there has been no
International Monetary Fund presence.</P>
      <P>"In Taiwan, as in Hong Kong and to some extent Singapore, high
rates of growth have been achieved. In thinking about how to rebuild
in Asia, the Taiwanese example might be a good place to start,"
Altschul added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>M'LAND CHINA STRUGGLING WITH NUMEROUS ECONOMIC PROBLEMS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>San  Francisco, Feb. 24 (CNA)
(By Neil Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Although spared the currency panics
that spread from Thailand to South Korea last year, mainland China
now faces the collapse of its real estate boom, the specter of
widespread bank failures, rampant deflation and a sharp slowdown in
its growth rate, reported the San Francisco Chronicle.</P>
      <P>A tumbling mainland Chinese economy would take the rest of Asia
down with it and hurt the United States by crimping its exports, the
Chronicle warned in an analysis by Jonathan Marshall.</P>
      <P>Other than a series of economic problems from falling real estate
prices, debt burdens, loss of state enterprises and bad bank loans,
the report said, mainland China now faces growing competition in
world markets from its neighbors.</P>
      <P>Beijing estimates that a fifth of mainland China's exports
compete directly with products from Southeast Asia and South Korea,
which suffered attacks on their currencies last summer and fall. In
addition, mainland China sells about 40 percent of its exports to
Asia, where demand is plummeting.</P>
      <P>The big question now is whether mainland China will respond by
devaluing its currency to stay competitive against its neighbors, the
Chronicle said.</P>
      <P>Aware of the tremendous negative impact and danger a devaluation
would have, Beijing has pledged not to cut the value of the yuan, the
report said, adding that many experts take Beijing at its word.
"There is absolutely no chance of a devaluation," Gregory Chow of
Princeton University was quoted as saying. "They'll lose too much
credibility if they do."</P>

    <HEADLINE>AUSSIE COMPANIES' PROFITS SLUMP DUE TO ASIAN ECONOMIC CRISIS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Feb.  25  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Asian financial crisis is not only
hitting Australia's economic growth rate but also its companies'
profits, the Bureau of Australian Statistics (ABS) said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Figures from the ABS show company profits -- before tax, interest
and depreciation -- plunged 4.5 percent in seasonally adjusted terms
in the last quarter of 1997, compared to a revised rise of 3.2
percent in corporate profits in the third quarter of the same year.</P>
      <P>The ABS said the big fall in profits in the October-December
period of 1997 was driven by unusually large foreign exchange and
asset write-down losses by companies in the mining, transport and
service sectors in Australia.</P>
      <P>The mining sector has now suffered profit declines in three of
the last four quarters as a result of poor metal prices and declining
exports to Asia, the ABS said.</P>
      <P>Economists said the unexpected fall in company profits follows an
earlier forecast of a one percentage point decline in Australia's
gross domestic product in fiscal 1997-98, falling to some 3 percent
from the original forecast of over 4 percent.</P>
      <P>Colonial State Bank chief economist Craig James said, "The Asian
crisis has hit Australian firms at a time when profitability is
vulnerable."</P>
      <P>Federal Opposition Treasurer Gareth Evans, who was formerly
foreign minister under the Labor Party government, said, "These poor
profit figures are highly worrying as they suggest that Australian
companies are not as well placed to withstand the economic fallout
from Asia when it hits with full force later this year."</P>

    <HEADLINE>EVERGREEN FOUNDER CALLS FOR SPEEDY DEVELOPMENT OF SHIPPING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Keelung,  northern  Taiwan,  Feb.  25  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Because Taiwan is an
island, it should make progress in shipping its top priority and have
an advanced maritime sector, Evergreen Group Chairman Chang Jung-fa
said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Chang, who founded Evergreen Marine Corp. with one second-hand
vessel in 1968 and steered the company into becoming the world's
largest container ship operator 17 years later, said he succeeded
because he dared to stretch out, however modestly.</P>
      <P>Chang was awarded an honorary doctorate degree in maritime
management Wednesday by National Taiwan Ocean University (NTOU) in
recognition of his contribution to Taiwan's shipping sector, making
him the recipient of the first honorary degree ever given by the
university in its nearly four-decade history.</P>
      <P>Although he has received honorary doctorates from two foreign
universities, Chang said he felt particularly proud to be cited by a
university in his own country.</P>
      <P>In his speech during the degree-presentation ceremony at NTOU,
Chang lamented that even though Taiwan is an island, the government
here, like its predecessor in mainland China, knows only "mountain"
but nothing about "ocean."</P>
      <P>Noting that the island-based Japan has become an advanced
country, he laid the blame for Taiwan not achieving similar results
on the government, which he said has not adequately recognized the
importance of maritime development and has not sufficiently
encouraged relevant sectors.</P>
      <P>Under Chang's leadership, in 1989 Evergreen expanded its
operations to aviation by establishing EVA Airways, Taiwan's second
airline to maintain international flights.</P>
      <P>Chang said that in a soul-searching session one week after the
island's worst air crash -- in which 202 persons killed when a China
Airlines Airbus 300 exploded near Chiang Kai-shek International
Airport -- he decided that the root cause of Taiwan's relatively high
rate of air accidents is that there is no aviation school on the
island.</P>
      <P>Lacking an aviation institute where pilots and relevant airlines
personnel can be nurtured systematically, Taiwan's airlines have
sought pilots and training from abroad, he pointed out. This practice
not only has been a major waste for Taiwan but also has contributed
nothing to efforts to nurture the island's own aviation service
sector, he added.</P>

      <P>Sheu Ke-sheng, vice chairman and spokesman
of the Taipei-based Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC),

Foundation (SEF) to proceed immediately with the necessary

      <P>If mainland China were to devalue its
currency, a global economic crisis could result, with Southeast Asian
countries suffering the most, according to one of the world's biggest
funds managers, Fidelity Institutional Asset Management (FIAM).</P>
      <P>FIAM chief investment officer Richard Horlick, currently on a
visit to Sydney, warned that the world's economic growth remains
critically poised on a devaluation of the yuan.</P>
      <P>Many analysts have speculated that US government representatives
have sought to ensure the stability of the Southeast Asian economy by
unofficially asking mainland China not to devalue the yuan in
exchange for Washington not pressuring Beijing on human rights.</P>
      <P>"Life would become extraordinarily difficult for most Southeast
Asian countries, as their goods became uncompetitive in world
markets," Horlick said in an interview with the mass circulation
newspaper The Australian on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>He said the recovery of Southeast Asian markets was also
critically dependent on inflation staying low, allowing global
interest rates to remain on a stable and downward path.</P>
      <P>"Interest rates rising and world growth slowing down would make
it impossible for Southeast Asian companies to export and find a way
out of their problems," he said, adding, "People look at Asia as
another Mexico, where there was a relatively good recovery, but in
our analysis Asia will be much worse."</P>
      <P>FIAM now manages US$650 billion in institutional funds.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AFTER BALANCING BUDGET, CANADA WAGES WAR ON DEBT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  Feb.  24  (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Canada's finance minister declared the
government's chronic deficit dead Tuesday and went on to wage a war
on the nearly C$600 billion (US$397 billion) in federal debt.</P>
      <P>Paul Martin told Parliament he will be starting the assault with
a leg up because C$13 billion will have been paid off in the first
nine months of the current fiscal year thanks to a healthy economy,
growing revenues and low interest rates.</P>
      <P>Canada is the first G-7 country to declare a budget surplus,
squeaking by the United States by five months. This year's federal
ledger will balance at exactly zero, the first time in 28 years that
Ottawa has brought down a budget without a deficit, Martin said.</P>
      <P>That compares with a deficit of C$8.9 billion last year and C$42
billion when the Liberal Party took power in 1993.</P>
      <P>Ottawa also forecast the next two budgets will be balanced. That
would mark the first time in over 50 years Canada has balanced its
budget for three consecutive years.</P>
      <P>With those numbers, Martin pronounced, the next chapter of the
country's fiscal history has begun. "Canada's remaining fiscal
challenge is to significantly lower the government's debt burden," he
stated.</P>
      <P>At C$583.2 billion this year, the federal debt will stand at 68.1
percent of the gross domestic product. That's down from 71.1 percent
the previous year, and Martin forecast the ratio will fall to 62.9
percent by 2000.</P>
      <P>Still, the ratio is far worse than the G-7 average, estimated to
be 46.7 percent this year. In fact, only Italy is expected to exceed
Canada this year in this ratio with 107.3 percent.</P>
      <P>In fiscal 1997-98, which ends on March 31, about 30 cents of each
revenue dollar will be used to pay interest on the public debt,
double the amount paid in the mid-1970s and a big drain on the
government's spending power.</P>
      <P>Analysts said despite all the progress on the deficit, debt
rating agencies will not return Canada to a top credit rating until
its debt-GDP ratio falls near 50 percent.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AIDC TO FORGE COOPERATION AGREEMENT WITH US SIMULATOR MAKER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  Feb. 25 (CNA)
(By Chi Chin-ling &amp; Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's state-run Aerospace Industrial
Development Corporation (AIDC) will forge cooperation links with
Reflectone, an American maker of technology training systems, to
jointly open Taiwan's simulator market, which is estimated to create
US$15 million-worth of business opportunities per year.</P>
      <P>AIDC Chairman Tsai Chun-hui revealed the cooperation project at
the Asian Aerospace Show '98, which opened in Singapore on Tuesday
for a week-long exhibition of advanced aeronautic products from
around the world.</P>
      <P>Tsai said his company is scheduled to sign a letter of intent on
cooperation with Reflectone on Thursday. The deal means AIDC will be
granted technology transfers from the US' leading simulator maker,
the chairman noted.</P>
      <P>Reflectone, which has its headquarters in the US state of
Florida, enjoys a reputation as one of the world's pioneers in high
technology military and commercial aviation training systems.</P>
      <P>Prompted by the lure of profits in the Asia-Pacific region,
Reflectone Vice Chairman S. Anthony Brancato told the CNA that they
expect Taiwan will become a stronghold for the company's push into
the Asian market, pointing out that there is around US$15
million-worth of trade prospects for Reflectone products, including
simulators for the entertainment sector and for civil aviation
services, in Taiwan alone.</P>
      <P>An AIDC executive in charge of the cooperation project also
stressed that besides domestic demand, his company is especially
eyeing the large regional market, in which so far only Japan
possesses the technology to produce various types of simulator.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, AIDC could also take over Reflectone's maintenance and
repair operation for Reflectone-produced military simulation and
training systems on the island, the official noted.</P>
      <P>AIDC, which has its headquarters in northern Taiwan's Hsinchu
Science-based Industrial Park, originated as a military-run institute
that built Taiwan's locally designed Indigenous Defense Fighters. The
government-funded company is now undergoing privatization.</P>
      <P>Reflectone, founded in 1939 and now 52.7 percent owned by British
Aerospace, is the US' second-largest military simulation system
producers, which offers military simulators for C130 aircraft. It is
currently working on designing a full flight simulation and training
system for the C130J transport aircraft of Britain's Royal Air Force.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 25 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Defense Minister Chiang Chung-ling said on
Wednesday that mechanical failure might have been the cause of
Tuesday's crash of an air force T-38 trainer off the southeastern
coast of Taiwan which resulted in the death of a flight instructor
and the injury of a trainee.</P>
      <P>Preliminary investigations show that the trainer's exhaust was
emitting fire immediately prior to the accident during a routine
training flight over Tungho, a small township in the eastern county
of Taitung, Chiang said, emphasizing that further investigation will
be needed before the real cause can be established.</P>
      <P>"The air force has formed a special task force to investigate the
case, and we'll announce the true reason after the investigation is
completed," he said.</P>
      <P>According to Chiang, the pilot of the lead aircraft, upon
spotting the flames coming from his wingman, had taken emergency
action and immediately instructed the instructor and trainee aboard
the stricken plane to eject.</P>
      <P>Both the flight instructor, Huang Chi-hung, and the trainee,
Liang Chih-hung, were picked up by rescue helicopters some seven
miles off the coast and airlifted to a nearby military hospital,
where Huang was later pronounced dead while Liang's condition was
reported as stable.</P>
      <P>Chiang said the ill-fated trainer was leased from the United
States. The air force was originally scheduled to return the jet to
the US at the end of June. "We'll handle the compensation issue
carefully in accordance with the leasing contract with the US," the
defense minister said.</P>
      <P>He expressed sadness over Huang's death, describing him as a
brilliant pilot, one of an elite group of instructors who in 1994
received training in the US and returned to Taiwan to pass his
knowledge on to others.</P>
      <P>It was the second air force crash in one week. Last Thursday, a
Chunghsing training jet crashed into the sea off the coast of Taipei
County, but its pilot ejected safely.</P>
      <P>Chiang said the air force is reviewing its flight safety measures
and will take the necessary steps to prevent a recurrence of flight
accidents.</P>

    <HEADLINE>INDONESIA WOULD BE SET BACK DECADES IF IT EXPELS CHINESE: OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Feb. 25 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Indonesia's economy would be set back 30
to 50 years if Jakarta expels the country's six million ethnic
Chinese, a leading intellectual in the world's biggest Moslem country
has warned.</P>
      <P>The warning was made by Yusuf Wanandi, director of Indonesian
President Suharto's Golkar Party, in an interview in Jakarta with
Peter Hartcher of The Australian Financial Review, Australia's
leading business newspaper.</P>
      <P>Wanandi, himself a Chinese Indonesian, said most ethnic Chinese
have become or will become scapegoats because they have been singled
out every time when there have been economic problems or difficulties
in Indonesia.</P>
      <P>At some six million, Indonesia's ethnic Chinese account for only
about 3 percent of Indonesia's total population, but they control 70
percent of the country's economic power.</P>
      <P>"The Chinese are very afraid, especially in the regions, because
they don't know what to expect and nobody is protecting them any
more," said Wanandi, chairman of the Center for Strategic and
International Studies in Jakarta and a key figure in Indonesia's
informal diplomacy abroad.</P>
      <P>He said that ethnic Chinese are increasingly becoming the first
target of Indonesian protesters and mobs because the country's
economy continues to deteriorate.</P>
      <P>He said there are three factors contributing to this situation.</P>
      <P>First, ethnic Chinese have been accused of earning their fortunes
in Indonesia but then sending the profits abroad, undermining the
rupiah and precipitating the crisis, he said.</P>
      <P>"The second reason is that the relation between Indonesians and
Chinese has been one of the fault lines of our political stability.
Whenever anything goes wrong, it is always the Chinese who are
blamed," Wanandi said.</P>
      <P>"The Chinese were used as compradors by the Dutch and the
Japanese colonial powers. And in the New Order (of Indonesia), they
have been confined to business, and they are most exposed now. So
whenever there's anything to do with the economy, the Chinese get
picked up," he said.</P>
      <P>"The third reason is irresponsible statements made by some
officials. They have accused us of being outlaws," he added.</P>
      <P>He warned that the persecution of ethnic Chinese would cost
Indonesia dearly. "If they want the Chinese out, it will set the
country back 30 to 50 years," he said.</P>
      <P>He said some of big Chinese tycoons have already left Indonesia
under the guise of going abroad on business.</P>
      <P>Wanandi said ethnic Chinese should not be singled out just
because they send their money out of Indonesia because the little
people, the ordinary people and the middle class of Indonesians have
also done the same thing by parking their money abroad.</P>
      <P>He said these Indonesians do not trust the rupiah, especially in
time of difficulty.</P>
      <P>He said the Indonesian government did not prepare the people for
the price increases.</P>
      <P>The result is that the masses blame the merchants, and the
majority of the merchants in Indonesia are ethnic Chinese, Wanandi
said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Economics Minister Wang
Chih-kang said on Wednesday that joining the World Trade Organization
(WTO) will bring long-term benefits for the nation.</P>
      <P>Wang made the remarks in an address to the Kuomintang (KMT)
caucus in the Legislative Yuan on the progress of Taiwan's bid to
enter the world trade regulatory body and on the just-concluded WTO
consultations between Taiwan and the United States.</P>
      <P>He noted that Taiwan is an export-oriented nation which has
recorded booming imports and exports in recent years. However,
because Taiwan is not a WTO member, it cannot join other nations in
working out norms of world trade and is excluded from multilateral
trade talks. Even when Taiwan is being unfairly treated or
discriminated against in terms of trade, it is unable to resolve
related problems through normal channels.</P>
      <P>He said that the WTO has wide and far-reaching implications over
every aspect of world trade activity. If Taiwan cannot join the
organization, it will be unable to continue to maintain its stature
in the world economy.</P>
      <P>Speaking of Taiwan's progress in its bid to enter the WTO, Wang
said eight years have passed since Taiwan applied for membership of
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the WTO's
forerunner. During this period, Wang said, Taiwan has concluded talks
with 24 of the 26 WTO signatory parties that requested bilateral
talks with Taiwan on its terms for accession. The two yet to conclude
talks are the 15-member European Union and Switzerland.</P>
      <P>He added that the US, which has requested Taiwan to make the most
concessions and most extensive market opening out of the 26 WTO
signatory parties, finally initialed a WTO agreement with Taiwan over
the weekend, taking Taiwan's bid for entry into the final stages.</P>
      <P>To cope with the possible impact of WTO membership on Taiwan's
industrial, agricultural and service sectors, Wang said the
government has worked out substantial measures to ease this impact by
upgrading the long-term competitiveness of these industries.</P>

      <P>Chang Shiu-lien, director of the Department of National Treasury
under the Finance Ministry, made the statement after concluding wine
and tobacco trade issues with EU negotiators.</P>
      <P>EU countries have long complained about Taiwan's discriminatroy
monopoly tax rates on their liquors. Taiwan currently imposes a
monopoly tax of NT$1,000 (US$30.48) per liter for French cognac,
compared to NT$500 for brandy from other countries. Meanwhile, the
monopoly tax for Scotch whisky, compared to NT$198 for whisky from
other nations.</P>
      <P>Chang said the government has decided to flexibly lower monopoly
taxes for liquor imports from EU countries even before Taiwan's
WTO entry.</P>
      <P>Chang said the chief EU negotiator, Jean-Pierre de Laet, has
tentatively agreed to Taiwan-proposed new monopoly tax rates for
liquors from EU countries. The new rates will be implemented after
the EU's executive arm, the European Commission, endorses the
proposal.</P>
      <P>Chang would not reveal the new monopoly tax rates for EU
liquors. She just said the government has referred to import prices
of EU liquors and tariff rates to be imposed under a new taxation
system in working out those rates.</P>
      <P>After the new rates take effect, market sources said local
consumers will benefit because prices for liquors from EU countries,
including French cognac and Scotch whisky, will drop in the local
retail market. The new rates may take effect in March and prices for
EU liquors may drop by NT$100 to NT$300 per bottle, the sources
said.</P>
      <P>Chang said Taiwan has decided to replace its decades-old wine and
tobacco monopoly system with a new taxation system. For years,
Taiwan levies "monopoly profits" on tobacco and alcohol sales under
a monopoly system. After the system is phased out, Taiwan will
impose tariffs, wine and tobacco taxes and commodity taxes on
imported and locally produced tobacco and alcoholic products. The
new system will be implemented after Taiwan is formally admitted
into the WTO.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and the EU began a new round of WTO-related talks on
Tuesday. The two sides have resolved many contentious issues. They
will discuss some remaining issues concerning Taiwan's tariff
reduction plan for automobiles and other industrial products as well
as libearlization of government procurement measures on Thursday.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's foreign reserves rose for the

increase of US$528 million over the same period of one year ago,
according to statistics released on Wednesday by the Central Bank of
China (CBC).</P>
      <P>However, the figure is still down from last June's US$90.02

October, before climbing back to this January's level.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's foreign reserves still rank third in the world, behind
the Japan's US$219.6 billion and mainland China's US$139.9 billion,
according to data compiled by the International Monetary Fund.</P>
      <P>However, Hong Kong, ranked fourth with US$75.3 billion in foreign

    <TEXT>
      <P>Chairman Kao Koong-lian of the Mongolian
and Tibetan Affairs Commission said on Wednesday the government will
not ban visits here by Tibetan, Mongolian and Turkistan independence
activists.</P>
      <P>Kao was responding to questions regarding the expected arrival in
Taiwan by Thubten Jigme Norbu, the eldest brother of the Dalai Lama,
and a group of Tibetan, Mongolian and Turkistan independence
activists.</P>
      <P>The delegation was invited by several local political bodies
seeking Taiwan's independence, including the World Federation of
Taiwanese Association, the World United Formosans for Independence,
the Green Party and the Taiwan Independence Party.</P>
      <P>The group, scheduled to arrive in Taipei on Wednesday evening,
will call on Legislative Yuan President Liu Sung-pan and Taipei Mayor
Chen Shui-bian as well as attend a series of symposiums on Tibet's
future before leaving for Japan on March 9.</P>
      <P>Other members of the group include Tashi Jamyangling, former
interior minister of the Tibetan government-in-exile; Katie Murphy,
deputy director of the International Tibet Independence Movement;
Johnghar Bache, vice chairman of the Inner Mongolian People's Party;
Anwar Yusuf, founder of the East Turkistan Freedom Center; and, Erkin
Apptekin, a representative of the Unrepresented Nations and Peoples
Organization.</P>
      <P>Kao said that the Republic of China government still considers
Tibet part of the national territory in accordance with both the
provisions of the ROC Constitution and historical factors.</P>
      <P>The Dalai Lama, the Tibetan spiritual leader, has made it clear
on several occasions that he and his exiled government pursue the
autonomy of Tibet, rather than its independence -- a declaration
which Kao said does not come into conflict with the Constitution,
which stipulates that the government should safeguard Tibet's
autonomous system.</P>
      <P>Since the government treats the Tibetan people as ROC citizens,
it is in no position to ban them from advocating Tibet's
independence, as Taiwan is an open and democratic society, Kao
stressed.</P>

      <P>A renowned gynecologist in Tainan City,
southern Taiwan, was shot to death and immolated several hours after
he was kidnapped by two gunmen at his clinic on Tuesday morning,
police said.</P>
      <P>They said the charred remains of Hsieh Cheng-hsien, 42, were
found abandoned in a remote mountainous area of Kaohsiung County,
south of Tainan, on Wednesday afternoon. He is believed to have been
shot to death before his body was set aflame, the police said. An
apparent gunshot to the victim's left temple exited through the right
side of his head, they said, adding that it appears the doctor had
been bound with ropes.</P>
      <P>The body was identified by Hsieh's family from dental records and
physical features on Wednesday morning. But police said that DNA
testing is also in process to confirm the identity.</P>
      <P>Hsieh was apprehended by two masked men armed with knives and
guns at 9:12 a.m. Tuesday at his clinic in Tainan City. Attempting to
resist, Hsieh was beaten by the assailants and then bundled into to a
red car, where a third kidnapper was waiting to drive away.</P>
      <P>The kidnappers made several phone calls to Hsieh's family between
Tuesday afternoon and early Wednesday morning, demanding a ransom of
NT$30 million (US$923,000) in exchange for the doctor's release. The
amount was eventually reduced to NT$5 million after bargaining.
Although the kidnappers gave several sets of instructions as to where
the ransom payment could be dropped off -- variously in Tainan
County, Tainan City and Kaohsiung county -- they never showed up.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Amid shrinking overall foreign trade and
fewer exports, Taiwan registered a trade surplus of US$140 million in
January, a decline of 86.7 percent compared to the same period of
last year.</P>
      <P>Statistics prepared by the Board of Foreign Trade under the
Ministry of Economic Affairs show that Taiwan exported US$7.63
billion worth of goods last month, a decline of 26.3 percent from
January 1997, while importing goods worth US$7.49 billion, a 19.4
percent decline.</P>
      <P>The island's trade surplus with its traditional major trading
partner, the United States, declined by 24 percent to US$390 million,
resulting from US$2.03 billion worth of exports and US$1.65 billion
worth of imports.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile local exports to Japan declined by 39.8 percent to
US$650 million, while imports from that country declined by 22.1
percent to US$1.75 billion, representing a negative balance of US$1.1
billion.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's exports to Hong Kong dropped by 28.1 percent to US$1.6
billion in January, while imports from the territory were trimmed by
18.8 percent to US$150 million, accounting for a surplus of US$1.45
billion.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's exports and imports with members of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations both registered in at US$850 million, for an
even balance sheet, but declined by 38.3 percent and 21 percent,
respectively, from January 1997 levels.</P>
      <P>Compared with the same period of last year, Taiwan's exports to
Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia and the Philippines saw substantial
drops of 51.6 percent, 42.6 percent, 41.9 percent and 34.9 percent,
respectively, largely because of the financial woes which swept
through the region.</P>
      <P>Taiwan posted a slim trade surplus of US$20 million with European

    <TEXT>
      <P>Paul K.J. Shan, the newly appointed
cardinal from Kaohsiung, Taiwan, shared his honor with his
compatriots Wednesday upon his return from the Vatican.</P>
      <P>At a press conference hosted by the Government Information
Office, Shan pointed out that he was the only Chinese and the only
Asian among 20 cardinals elevated by Pope John Paul II in a
consistory at the Vatican on Saturday, which he said reflects the
importance the Holy See attaches to Roman Catholicism in the Republic
of China.</P>
      <P>The pope's concern for the Chinese people, Shan added, is also
indicated by the fact that there are now four ethnic Chinese
cardinals worldwide, including the 94-year-old Cardinal of Shanghai
Kung Pinmei, who currently lives in the United States, Cardinal Hu
Chen-chung in Hong Kong, Shan himself and an undisclosed cardinal in
mainland China.</P>
      <P>That number is significant in light of the relative few Roman
Catholics among the Chinese, Shan said, noting that there are only
three cardinals in the Philippines among almost 60 million Catholic
followers in that country, and three cardinals among 10 million
believers in India.</P>
      <P>Shan said Pope John Paul II had expressed his personal hope that
the Chinese people will make outstanding contributions to world peace
in next century.</P>
      <P>Earlier Wednesday, Shan called on Premier Vincent Siew at the
Executive Yuan.</P>
      <P>Siew hailed Shan's elevation as an honor for the Roman Catholic
faithful in Taiwan as well as all residents of the island. It also
signified pope's approval of Taiwan's campaign for democracy and
human rights protection, the premier said.</P>
      <P>Siew said the pope has put his own stamp on the church through
his choice of the new cardinals.</P>

(By Maurus Young)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Geneva-based World Trade Organization
(WTO) gave support to a US proposal that electronic commerce should
be discussed in the global trade regulator body, but stopped short of
endorsing a plan to keep the Internet duty-free.</P>
      <P>Washington is hoping for a quick WTO decision on duty-free
Internet trade, which would apply only to products delivered by
electronic means, but seems likely to be disappointed, according to
reports from the organization on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Launching his electronic commerce initiative last July, US
President Bill Clinton said he was aiming for a WTO accord within a
year, and Rita Hayes, US ambassador to the WTO, said that the United
States would like some results by the time of the WTO's ministerial
meeting in Geneva, on May 20, 1998.</P>
      <P>However, it was clear from the initial discussion at the WTO's
ruling General Council that many countries are reluctant to make a
binding commitment in the WTO without a broader look at the
implication for trade and taxation of the expected explosion in
electronic commerce over the next few years, the WTO report said.</P>
      <P>Washington argues that no country currently treats electronic
transmissions across borders as imports subject to customs duties,
any more than they levy tariffs on international telephone calls or
fax messages. Hayes said the United States was simply proposing that
WTO members agree to maintain current practice "to give business
certainty for the future."</P>
      <P>The duty-free proposal applied only to products supplied
electronically and would not affect tariffs on goods ordered through
the Internet and delivered physically across national frontiers, she
said. Nor did the proposal affect or set a precedent for domestic
taxes or regulation of electronic commerce.</P>
      <P>However, most WTO members said they needed more time to study the
issues and the European Commission, which has just produced its own
proposals for global governance of the Internet, said it planned to
also submit some ideas to the WTO, the WTO report added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Singapore's economic growth hit a
remarkable 7.8 percent last year, nearly 1 percent higher than 1996's
6.9 percent rise, but it is expected to slow significantly this year,
the Singapore Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The government's earlier official forecast of economic growth for
1998 was set at between 5 percent and 7 percent. However, the MTI had
to readjust its growth forecast down to between 2.5 and 4.5 percent,
taking into account the adverse effects of the regional economic
crisis and financial turmoil which have swept through Southeast Asian
countries since last July, an MTI spokesman said.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that the construction sector, boosted by public
works projects, scored a remarkably high growth rate of 13 percent
last year, leading all economic sectors on the growth path.</P>
      <P>The financial sector, which also achieved a high 11 percent
growth rate in 1997, also contributed a great deal to the Singapore
economy, he added.</P>
      <P>Due to the recovery of the world's electronics industry in the
latter half of last year, Singapore's manufacturing sector, with
electronics being its major pillar, also achieved an impressive

    <TEXT>
      <P>Lin Yi-fu, vice economic affairs Minister
of the Republic of China, arrived in London on Wednesday at the head
of an ROC government mission to take part in a Taiwan-Britain
bilateral economic and trade consultation slated to kick off on
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Lin and British Trade and Industry Minister Tony Hutton will lead
their respective delegations into the talks, during which the two
sides will exchange views on Taiwan's monopoly tax on whiskey imports
from Britain, and finance, insurance and law firm operations.</P>
      <P>Talks over Taiwan's monopoly tax on Scotch whisky will be the
centerpiece of the consultation as Taiwan has recently agreed in
principle to cut the tax on spirits from the European Union (EU).
Taiwan made the concession on Wednesday in the second day of the 12th
round of ROC-EU talks on terms for Taipei's accession to the World
Trade Organization (WTO).</P>
      <P>Britain has been so successful at marketing Scotch whisky in
Taiwan during the last several years that it is now the second
largest British export item to the island.</P>
      <P>Scotch whisky, however, has been unable to compete with Japanese
whiskey in Taiwan because the liquors from Europe are hit with much
higher taxes than similar products from other regions, British trade
sources complained.</P>
      <P>Under Taiwan's tobacco and alcohol monopoly system, a tax of
NT$440 (US$13.4) per liter is levied on whiskey from Scotland and
Ireland, while the rate for whiskey from other regions is set at
NT$198 (US$6).</P>
      <P>The Scot Whisky Association called the taxation schedule
discriminatory and said it is responsible for the decreased market
share of European liquors.</P>
      <P>Scotch whisky accounted for 38.49 percent of total liquor imports
in the first 10 months of last year, down from 44.64 percent in 1996,
while the market share of Japanese whiskey rose from 6.78 percent to
22.21 percent over the same period, according to Taiwan customs

    <HEADLINE>ITEM TWO: FORMER US NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER LAKE TO VISIT TAIPEI</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Feb.  26  (CNA)
(By Jay Chen and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Tony Lake, a former US national
security adviser, is scheduled to arrive in Taiwan on March 4 for a
four-day visit.</P>
      <P>During his stay in Taipei, Lake will deliver a speech on the US
role in Asia-Pacific regional security and meet with senior Republic
of China officials for wide-ranging talks.</P>
      <P>Lake, who left his former post just over a year ago, served as
the top security adviser to President Bill Clinton during the 1996
Taiwan Strait crisis. His speech is expected to provide a glimpse
into the thinking of Washington's inner circles regarding
Asia-Pacific security issues.</P>
      <P>Stephen Chen, Taiwan's de facto ambassador to the United States,
said Lake is well aware of the twists and turns in ROC-US relations.
"We believe his visit will help boost mutual understanding between
the two countries."</P>
      <P>Chen hosted a luncheon in honor of Lake on Wednesday, wishing him
a good trip to Taipei.</P>
      <P>Lake, now a professor at Georgetown University, told reporters
after the luncheon that he has long planned to visit Taiwan. "I'm
delighted that this plan will be realized soon."</P>
      <P>Lake's Taipei visit is organized by the Central Daily News. In
addition to delivering a series of speeches, he will meet with ROC
officials in charge of diplomatic, mainland and national security
affairs. He is also expected to meet with President Lee Teng-hui and
Premier Vincent Siew.</P>
      <P>Lake served as Clinton's top national security adviser from
January 1993 through the end of 1996. Clinton once named Lake as
director of the Central Intelligence Agency.</P>
      <P>After three days of tedious and often embarrassing congressional
questioning about his personal finances during the confirmation
process, Lake issued a statement saying he would rather give up the
appointment than endure further insults. He later decided to take up
a teaching post at Georgetown University. Lake holds a doctorate in
public and international affairs from Princeton University.</P>
      <P>Earlier this year, former US Defense Secretary William Perry
also headed a high-profile delegation of former American officials to
visit mainland China and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Members of Perry's delegation, which focused on relations across
the Taiwan Strait, included John Shalikashvili, a former chairman of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Brent Scowcroft, a former national
security adviser.</P>
      <P>The prestigious Washington Post reported recently that Perry's
mission was part of a delicate attempt by the US government to open
an informal back channel of communications with both sides of the
Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The paper said US officials, frustrated by not-very-productive
official dialogue with mainland China on Taiwan-related issues and
the US government ban on travel to Taiwan by senior American
officials since Washington switched recognition to Beijing in 1979,
have encouraged the formation of what they call a "track 2" dialogue
with Taipei and Beijing with the aim of decreasing tension between
the two rivals.</P>
      <P>However, Clinton administration officials have clarified the
Washington Post report, saying that the Perry mission's visits to
both sides of the Taiwan Strait were private in nature and that the
opinions expressed by the delegation members did not represent the
administration's official stance.</P>
      <P>Political observers said even though opinions expressed by those
former US security officials do not necessarily represent official
US positions, the visits to Taipei by the Perry delegation and Lake
will help the people of Taiwan better understand the basic US
stance on cross-strait relations and the role the US wants to play
in the Asia-Pacific region.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  26 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Economics Minister Wang Chih-kang said on
Thursday that Taiwan may have the chance to join the World Trade
Organization (WTO) by the end of the year.</P>
      <P>Wang made the remarks when he and Council of Agriculture (COA)
Chairman Peng Tzuo-kuei, along with COA Vice Chairman Ling
Shiang-nung, called on the opposition New Party caucus at the
Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Asked when Taiwan could expect gain membership in the world trade
regulatory body, Wang said Taiwan has so far concluded negotiations
with 24 of the 26 WTO signatory parties that requested bilateral
talks, thus the accession bid is entering the final stage.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is now wrapping up talks with the 15-member European Union
(EU), and will soon hold another round of discussions with
Switzerland, Wang said.</P>
      <P>He said the WTO working party screening Taiwan's membership
application is expected to hold a meeting in April for multilateral
talks on the matter.</P>
      <P>The WTO Secretariat has prepared a report on Taiwan's application
and a draft protocol on terms for its accession, which are expected
to be discussed at the WTO working party in its April meeting.</P>
      <P>Wang said it is likely that Taiwan can join the WTO by the end of
the year, although he cannot be sure of the timetable.</P>
      <P>On concerns about the adverse impact of compliance with WTO
liberalization measures upon Taiwan's chicken and hog industries,
Peng said the COA will set up a NT$3 billion (US$92.3 million),
six-year program to help the poultry industry adjust.</P>
      <P>Peng said hog farmers will eventually have to reduce the
islandwide hog population by 2 million head from the current 8
million. The COA will also devise counseling programs and rescue
packages as well as improve distribution networks to keep industry
losses to a minimum.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Government spokesman Chen Chien-jen on
Thursday kept mum about whether President Lee Teng-hui's planned trip
to Africa will be canceled or postponed, saying only that everything
is yet to be decided.</P>
      <P>Chen, director-general of the Government Information Office
(GIO), declined to comment on recent local newspaper reports that
Lee's African tour, scheduled to take place between late March and
early April, will be postponed or canceled outright because of
concerns over flight security, weather conditions, the availability
of telecommunication facilities and medical factors.</P>
      <P>He said the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Presidential
Office are in close consultation over the proposed visits to ROC
allies in Africa, but nothing is finalized at the moment.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chen was also tight-lipped about Vice President Lien
Chan's current trip to the Middle East. He admitted that he could not
say anything about Lien's itinerary, except to confirm a visit to
Jordan, in order to avoid interference from Beijing that could
jeopardize the remainder of his tour.</P>
      <P>Chen said that with Beijing stepping up efforts to suppress
Taiwan's pragmatic diplomacy initiatives, arrangements for high-level
officials to travel abroad, particularly to countries maintaining no
formal ties with the ROC, have become increasingly difficult.</P>
      <P>Relevant sources disclosed that Lien's plans to fly to Lebanon
and Bahrain following his Feb. 23-25 visit to Jordan may be altered
due to objections from Beijing.</P>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Vincent Siew on Thursday condemned
the violence that erupted earlier this month in a public hearing on a
plan by German chemical giant Bayer to set up a plant in central
Taiwan's Taichung County.</P>
      <P>Siew said that Bayer's US$1.5 billion investment project has been
under assessment over the past four years, but noted that the public
still has misgivings about the plan.</P>
      <P>He said, however, that such concerns should be expressed through
normal channels, adding that the silent majority will not condone the
use of violence.</P>
      <P>Commenting on repeated clashes between local people and police
units during the Taiwan Provincial Assembly's screening process for
the project, Siew also said that relevant government agencies
should act to prevent illegal or irregular activities associated with
the controversial project, less they have a detrimental influence on
public safety and social stability.</P>
      <P>Siew's words came during a screening meeting on the land-leasing
agreement with Bayer in the Taiwan Provincial Assembly on Thursday.</P>
      <P>The meeting was delayed for nearly 90 minutes as legislators from
the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) and the opposition Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) discussed strategies behind closed doors.</P>
      <P>But soon after the screening began at 10:55 a.m., DPP Assemblyman
Yu Cheng-dao accused his colleague Lin Chin-chun of the KMT of having
dinner with officials from land development companies during the
Chinese New Year holiday to discuss possible allocation of
construction work for the project after Bayer's proposal cleared the
provincial assembly.</P>
      <P>Lin, saying that Yu has insulted him, demanded evidence to
substantiate the accusation. He also asked for an independent
investigation of the matter.</P>
      <P>Several KMT assemblymen echoed his demands and asked Yu to
renounce his right of legislative immunity in order to undergo an
investigation. But Yu refused and a bitter war of words erupted.</P>
      <P>Yang Wen-hsin, deputy speaker of Provincial Assembly, had to
adjourn the screening meeting until the afternoon due to the chaotic
situation.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, nearly 1,000 people opposed to the Bayer project again
gathered in front of the Provincial Assembly building, waving banners
and making speeches to voice their opposition to the plan.</P>
      <P>But supporters of the project were not present this time. One
official from the pro-Bayer camp said his alliance did not mobilize
the public in the interest of maintaining local harmony and because
they had already clearly expressed their views.</P>
      <P>A police force of 1,500 was deployed to maintain order.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  26  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>After more than a year of effort,
law-enforcement officers managed to break a Hong Kong-based drug
trafficking ring and seize 100 kilograms of mainalnd China-originated
heroin and amphetamine Wednesday evening, the Ministry of Justice
Investigation Bureau (MJIB) reported on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Three key suspects involved in the illegal narcotics trade,
including a former Hong Kong police officer, were also arrested in
Keelung, a port city some 30 kilometers north of Taipei.</P>
      <P>The mastermind of the ring, identified as Cheung Po Ming, once
served as a unit leader in the Hong Kong police department, MJIB
officials said. He left his post a few years ago and had since used
his professional expertise to smuggle contraband drugs into Taiwan.</P>
      <P>As Cheung was familiar with criminal investigative tactics, he
used various anti-shadowing techniques to counter local
investigators' monitoring activities. The special task force,
composed of MJIB agents, prosecutors and military police officers,
has devoted much energy and resources to probe the ring's activities
over the past year.</P>
      <P>The task force had kept on high alert after it found that the
ring might have smuggled a new batch of drugs from mainland China
during the Lunar New Year holiday. MJIB agents had closely shadowed
Cheung upon his arrival in Taipei on Monday.</P>
      <P>Cheung and his accomplice, Ng Tim Ka, also a Hong Kong resident,
were caught red-handed on Wednesday as they were taking delivery of
16 heroin bricks, with a street value of about NT$250 million
(US$7.69 million), and 37 bags of amphetamine, worth some NT$150
million, from a refrigerated warehouse in suburban Keelung and
loading them into an automobile.</P>
      <P>MJIB officers said the drugs were shipped from the mainland via a
fishing boat operated by Hsu Kun, who was also arrested on Wednesday.
The drugs were hidden in five of the 400 cartons of jellyfish
smuggled from the mainland.</P>
      <P>Cheung's ring allegedly was also involved in the smuggling of
two batches of heroin from the mainland into Taiwan, which were
seized by law-enforcement officers on Dec. 4 and Dec. 14, 1996,
respectively. The ring had managed to set up a warehouse and an
islandwide distribution network in Taiwan over the past year.</P>
      <P>MJIB Director-General Wang Jung-chou lauded local investigators
for their professional sills and patience in probing the case.</P>
      <P>Wang said about 50 percent of heroin and 70 percent of
amphetamine confiscated here were originated in mainland China. "We
hope mainland authorities will closely cooperate with us to crack
down on drug trafficking," he added.</P>
      <P>Peng Kun-yeh, a chief prosecutor with the Taipei Prosecutor's
Office, said the busting of Cheung's ring was of great significance
because it was a major source of contraband drugs circulating here.
"As Cheung usually stayed in Hong Kong and only made brief stops
here to arrange for drug sales, it was a tough task to arrest him,"
he added.</P>
      <P>MJIB officials said the special task force will continue to
investigate whether there are other accomplices and the ring's
middle- and down-stream distribution channels here.</P>

      <P>New Zealand has urgently asked for
Australian expertise and resources to help restore power after a
serious blackout in its biggest city of Auckland, which has curtailed
commercial and other activities in the past few days.</P>
      <P>Mercury Energy of Australia, which has been requested to help

    <DATELINE>Canberra,   Feb.  26  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Immigrants do not rob jobs from
Australians, but instead help boost job prospects for the unemployed
people in this country, according to a new survey by the Australian
National University in Canberra.</P>
      <P>The survey, conducted by economists Prof. Bruce Chapman and Dr.
Deborah Cobb-Clark, shows many Australians fail to recognize that
while immigrants add to the competition for jobs, they also increase
employment by spending savings brought into this country.</P>
      <P>They said the benefits flowing to the unemployed from immigration
are higher during periods of economic recession than at other times.</P>
      <P>"The conclusion drawn from the exercise is precisely the opposite
of that promoted in populist discussion: Specifically, chances of an
unemployed resident gaining employment, immigration is more likely to
achieve this the more recessed the labor market," they said.</P>
      <P>Chapman said the conclusion is justified from "the overwhelming
weight of evidence from the United States, Canada and Australia that
higher levels of immigration have not been associated with higher
levels of unemployment."</P>
      <P>Under the current coalition government, the immigration intake
for fiscal 1997-98 is set at 68,000, down sharply from nearly 100,000
in 1996-97.</P>
      <P>The lower quota is the result of economic downturn, which keeps
Australia's unemployment rate quite high at more than 8 percent with
about 750,000 unemployed, and the criticism of Independent Member of
Parliament Pauline Hanson, who said higher intake of immigrants,
especially from Asia, has cost Australians jobs.</P>
      <P>The Australian government is now alarmed by the Asian economic
crisis, which could slow employment and increase unemployment rates
in this country.</P>
      <P>Market economists have predicted the unemployment rate could rise
to 9 percent, with more than 800,000 jobless later this year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ITEM ELEVEN: SINGAPORE 1998 GROWTH FORECAST CUT TO 2.5%-4.5%</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  Feb.  26  (CNA)
(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Singapore government on Wednesday
sharply downgraded its economic growth forecast for 1998 to between
2.5 percent and 4.5 percent due to the Asian financial turmoil, but
it ruled out for now any fears of a recession.</P>
      <P>The forecast is a drop from the 5 percent to 7 percent growth
predicted by the Singapore Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) last
November, and is the lowest projection since the 1985 recession.</P>
      <P>It is also a hefty fall against last year's better-than-expected
growth of 7.8 percent, announced in Singapore's annual economic
survey report released Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The 1997 growth, buoyed by a revised third-quarter figure and a
resilient fourth quarter, was an increase on the 7.6 percent Prime
Minister Goh Chok Tong announced in his New Year Message. It was, in
fact, higher than the 6.9 percent growth in 1996.</P>
      <P>Singapore's economic growth peaked at 10.5 percent in 1994,
before slowing down to 8.7 percent in 1995.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for MTI said on Wednesday that at this point, "We are
not expecting a recession, but obviously we are making our forecast
against a very volatile background."</P>
      <P>He noted that when the MTI issued its preliminary 1998 forecast
last November, the Indonesian rupiah was trading at 3,300 to the US
dollar. The current rate is about 9,380:1.</P>
      <P>The slowdown caused by the regional turmoil would be offset by
continued growth in the United States and European countries, he
said.</P>
      <P>The impact of the regional turmoil began to filter through to
industries with a high reliance on regional demand only in the fourth
quarter.</P>
      <P>"But overall, the diversified nature of our economy helped to
overcome the initial impact of the regional financial turmoil, and
except for the construction and commerce sectors, all sectors grew
faster in 1997," the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>Fourth-quarter growth was a respectable 7.6 percent. The third
quarter was revised to 10.7 percent from 10.1.</P>
      <P>Growth in the current year is likely to be driven by the
manufacturing and construction sectors, which grew 4.3 percent and
13.3 percent, respectively, last year.</P>
      <P>The transport and communications sector will also pull its
weight, although growth there is expected to moderate from last
year's 9.2 percent.</P>
      <P>Likely underperformers will be companies in the finance and
commerce sectors as the regional economic slowdown begins to bite.</P>
      <P>Commerce is expected to take a hit as entrepot trade with the
region slows and regional tourist arrivals fall. The retail trade in
Singapore will also feel the pinch amid lower tourist numbers and
weak domestic demand.</P>
      <P>In 1997, commerce grew 5.8 percent compared to 1996's 6.2
percent.</P>
      <P>Financial and business services, which expanded 11 percent in
1997, are also likely to experience slower growth this year amid a
drop in regional lending activity in the Singapore-based Asian dollar
market, which is basically an offshore banking system.</P>
      <P>Despite the MTI's growth scale-back, the Straits Times
Industrials Index closed 21.47 points higher at 1,583.22 on
Wednesday.</P>

(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Asia-Pacific market potential for
flight simulators and related products has prompted two of world's
leading simulation systems creators to seek partners in the region
for business expansion.</P>
      <P>Reflectone of the United States will sign a cooperative agreement
with Taiwan's state-run Aerospace Industrial Development Corporation
(AIDC) at the Asian Aerospace Show here on Thursday, designed to set
up a regional manufacturing, maintenance and repair center for
simulators with both aeronautical and entertainment applications, by
merging the capital resources and technical know-how of the two
companies.</P>
      <P>The deal is estimated to generate US$15 million worth of business
annually. It will also allow AIDC to receive technology transfers
from the leading US simulator maker.</P>
      <P>Canada's CAE Inc., which controls a 70 percent stake of the
global civil flight simulator market, will also forge a strategic
alliance with the Chungshan Institute of Science and Technology
(CIST) of Taiwan on Thursday at the aerospace exhibition in
Singapore.</P>
      <P>CAE, headquartered in Toronto and operating several facilities
worldwide, is a technology leader known for the design and
manufacture of flight simulation equipment.</P>
      <P>Company representatives said CAE expects Asia to be the most
rapidly expanding market for the global flight simulator sector over
the next 20 years due to its obviously urgent need for advanced
aviation management systems and expertise.</P>
      <P>What prompts the CAE to develop cooperative links with Taiwan is
its assessment that the island's consumer power and human resources
make it the best stronghold for advancing into the huge Asia-Pacific
market, they said.</P>
      <P>The representatives added that the CIST's successful development
of a simulation system for fighter squadrons and Taiwan's large
market for military simulation systems and training devices were also
encouraging.</P>
      <P>The CIST is the military-run technology research unit that
designed and built Taiwan's first locally developed Indigenous
Defense Fighter (IDF), also known as the "Ching Kuo" fighter, after
the late Republic of China President Chiang Ching-kuo.</P>
      <P>A CIST spokesman said during the exhibition that its new fighter
squadron simulator is entirely "made in Taiwan," the joint creation
of the CIST and other six domestic enterprises in the information,
chemical and electronic sectors.</P>
      <P>With its available expertise and technologies, as well as the
imminent alliance with CAE, the spokesman said, the CIST hopes to
develop Taiwan into an Asia-Pacific regional hub for the manufacture,
maintenance and repair of civil and military flight simulators.</P>
      <P>The AIDC and CIST are among nine Taiwan aerospace and aviation
industry companies and insititutes taking part in the week-long 1998
Asian Aerospace Show.</P>

      <P>Another suspect involved in a Hong
Kong-based drug trafficking ring, which allegedly had sumggled
NT$400 million (US$12.3 million) worth of heroin and amphetamine
from mainland China into Taiwan recently, was arrested in the
northern Taiwan port city of Keelung on Thursday.</P>
      <P>The suspect, identified as Lam Kay Man, a Hong Kong passport
holder, was arrested early Thursday morning at a bowling alley in
downtown Keelung, the Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau (MJIB)
said. Lam has taken residence in Taiwan for several years. He was
allegedly responsible for taking delivery of contraband drugs sent by
the ring from abroad.</P>
      <P>After more than a year of effort, three other key suspects wanted
in connection with illegal narcotics trade, including a former Hong
Kong police officer, were arrested on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>MJIB agents also managed to confiscate 100 kilograms of
mainland China-originated heroin and amphetamine, with a street value
of NT$400 million, in Wednesday's raid.</P>
      <P>The mastermind of the ring, identified as Cheung Po Ming, once
served as a unit leader in the Hong Kong police department, MJIB
officials said. He left his post a few years ago and had since used
his professional expertise to smuggle contraband drugs into Taiwan.</P>
      <P>As Cheung was familiar with criminal investigative tactics, he
used various anti-shadowing techniques to counter local
investigators' monitoring activities. The special task force,
composed of MJIB agents, prosecutors and military police officers,
has devoted much energy and resources to probe the ring's activities
over the past year.</P>
      <P>The task force had kept on high alert after it found that the
ring might have smuggled a new batch of drugs from mainland China
during the Lunar New Year holiday. MJIB agents had closely shadowed
Cheung upon his arrival in Taipei on Monday.</P>
      <P>Cheung and his accomplice, Ng Tim Ka, also a Hong Kong resident,
were caught red-handed on Wednesday as they were taking delivery of
16 heroin bricks, with a street value of about NT$250 million
(US$7.69 million), and 37 bags of amphetamine, worth some NT$150
million, from a refrigerated warehouse in suburban Keelung and
loading them into an automobile.</P>
      <P>MJIB officers said the drugs were shipped from the mainland via a
fishing boat operated by Hsu Kun, who was also arrested on Wednesday.
The drugs were hidden in five of the 400 cartons of jellyfish
smuggled from the mainland.</P>
      <P>Cheung's ring allegedly was also involved in the smuggling of
two batches of heroin from the mainland into Taiwan, which were
seized by law-enforcement officers on Dec. 4 and Dec. 14, 1996,
respectively. The ring had managed to set up a warehouse and an
islandwide distribution network in Taiwan over the past year.</P>
      <P>MJIB Director-General Wang Jung-chou lauded local investigators
for their professional sills and patience in probing the case.</P>
      <P>Wang said about 50 percent of heroin and 70 percent of
amphetamine confiscated here were originated in mainland China. "We
hope mainland authorities will closely cooperate with us to crack
down on drug trafficking," he added.</P>
      <P>Peng Kun-yeh, a chief prosecutor with the Taipei Prosecutor's
Office, said the busting of Cheung's ring was of great significance
because it was a major source of contraband drugs circulating here.
"As Cheung usually stayed in Hong Kong and only made brief stops
here to arrange for drug sales, it was a tough task to arrest him,"
he added.</P>
      <P>MJIB officials said the special task force will continue to
investigate whether there are other accomplices as well as the
ring's middle- and down-stream distribution channels here.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ITEM SEVENTEEN: REGIONAL TURMOIL TO HAVE WIDE-RANGING IMPACT ON S'PORE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore, Feb. 26 (CNA)
(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The regional financial turmoil will have
a wide-ranging impact on the Singapore economy, with both domestic
and external demand for goods and services being hit hard, according
to the Singapore Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI).</P>
      <P>One bright spot is that demand from the United States and Europe
will help lift exports, the ministry said in a study on the impact of
the regional financial turmoil on the Singapore economy.</P>
      <P>"Given our diversified export market, exports of goods are likely
to be sustained by healthy demand from the United States and European
Union, while services exports are expected to be more severely hit by
the regional economic slowdown," it said.</P>
      <P>The demand for Singapore-made goods and services by neighboring
countries is likely to be hit harder in view of Singapore's close
links with the region, it noted.</P>
      <P>Sweetening the picture for domestic investment spending will be
the fillip provided by expenditure on infrastructure such as the
construction of Singapore's Northeast MRT line and Housing
Development Board upgrading projects.</P>
      <P>But the impact of the regional slowdown on consumption
expenditure is likely to be fairly significant, the MTI said.</P>
      <P>Slower economic activity and a negative wealth effect following
sharp declines in the Singapore and Malaysian stock markets -- which
fell by 36 percent and 47 percent respectively between July last year
and January this year -- is likely to reduce domestic consumption
spending.</P>
      <P>At the same time, the strength of the Singapore dollar in
relation to regional currencies will result in Singaporeans spending
more overseas, it said.</P>
      <P>Between 1991 and 1997, Singaporeans' overseas trips by air rose
by an average of 13 percent every year. Increased visits to
neighboring countries will particularly have an impact on retailers
of daily provisions in Singapore, the ministry said.</P>
      <P>Businesses are expected to hold back investing in new machinery
and equipment amid the weaker demand and greater uncertainty.
Moreover, poor sentiment in the property market is likely to limit
the buying of homes and commercial buildings.</P>
      <P>The study noted that with the new alignment of the regional
currencies, Singapore -- with its relatively strong dollar -- is
likely to face greater regional competition for investment from the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries. "The
challenge is for Singapore to continue upgrading our capabilities to
stay one step ahead," it said.</P>
      <P>The appreciation of the local dollar will also affect Singapore's
exports to the region, it pointed out. Exports meant for local
consumption in the region will be hit badly, but exports used as
intermediate inputs and reexported to developed countries are "likely
to remain relatively healthy."</P>
      <P>The MTI said it expects a significant impact on the exports of
services like air and sea cargo as they are destined largely for the
region. Singapore serves as an important hub for the movement of
people and goods.</P>
      <P>Air and sea cargo movement to the region slowed significantly in
the second half of last year.</P>
      <P>The study noted that tourism earnings are also likely to be
adversely affected as there will be fewer visitors from the region
due to the fall in disposable income and a more expensive Singapore
dollar.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ITEM TWENTY-ONE: ROC VICE PRESIDENT CANCELS TRIP TO LEBANON</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Beirut,  Feb. 26 (CNA)
(By Yang I-feng and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Vice President Lien Chan
has canceled a planned trip to the Middle East state of Lebanon
because of strong pressure from the ROC's archrival, mainland China.</P>
      <P>Lien may return to Taipei via Bahrain, but it is possible that
his itinerary might be subject to further change.</P>
      <P>Hotel sources said Lien had canceled reservations for three rooms
in Beirut's Commodore Hotel. He was originally expected to arrive
here on Thursday for a groundbreaking visit, but did not appear to
have been aboard either of Thursday's two scheduled flights from
Jordan to Lebanon.</P>
      <P>Local diplomatic sources said mainland Chinese embassies in the
region had pressured various Middle East countries to revoke visas
already issued to Lien after the itinerary of his trip was reported
by the media.</P>
      <P>The sources pointed out that Lebanon is particularly sensitive to
pressure from Beijing as mainland Chinese Foreign Minister Qian
Qichen promised late last year to offer US$6 million in aid to
Lebanon to help it rebuild its war-torn infrastructure.</P>
      <P>Other sources said the ROC has maintained regular contacts with
Lebanon in recent years. However, as the two sides have yet to come
to terms on some critical issues, no major breakthrough in bilateral
relations has been achieved so far. The ROC originally had hoped that
Lien's visit could help push forward the long-stalled bilateral ties.</P>
      <P>Lien left Taipei for Jordan on Monday for a private visit to
receive an honorary doctorate from the University of Jordan. Previous
press reports had said Lien then would travel to Lebanon and Bahrain.
None of the three Middle East states maintain formal diplomatic ties
with the ROC.</P>
      <P>He was also reportedly scheduled to make a stopover in the
Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur on his way home to discuss with
senior Malaysian officials feasible ccoperative measures to address
the current Asian financial turmoil.</P>
      <P>However, Beijing's sabotage has now caused Lien's itinerary
following his Jordan visit to become uncertain. Beijing has been
waging an extensive campaign against the ROC's diplomatic activities
in an attempt to isolate Taiwan in the international community.
Against his backdrop, senior ROC officials often have to keep their
overseas travel plans secret.</P>
      <P>Despite Beijing's pressure, Lien still had managed to visit
several major countries which do not maintain formal diploamtic ties
with the ROC in the past few years, including the Czech Republic,
Austria, Ukraine, Iceland and Ireland. The current Middle East
visit is Lien second trip abroad so far this year. He visited
Singapore in January.</P>
      <P>On his Middle East visit, Lien is being accompanied by his wife
and several senior government officials and close aides, including
Minister Without Portfolio Yang Shih-chien and Deputy
Secretary-General to the President Su Chi. Lien is scheduled to
return to Taipei on March 4.</P>

      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman
Chang King-yuh issued a statement on Thursday welcoming a response
from the Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Strait (ARATS) to its Taiwan counterpart the Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF) saying that it would welcome a visit to mainland
China by SEF Chairman Koo Chen-fu at an "appropriate time."</P>
      <P>Chang expressed delight over the ARATS message and said the MAC
has instructed the SEF to maintain further contact with the ARATS to
make the necessary arrangements for such a visit.</P>
      <P>Citing a policy address by Premier Vincent Siew on Tuesday, Chang
said Taiwan's stance on cross-strait talks is that any issues which
are beneficial to the interests of both sides of the Taiwan Strait
can be discussed under the framework set by previous SEF-ARATS talks
and that negotiations on matters which are vital to the interests of
the people on the two sides should be discussed first.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has maintained a firm stance in this regard over the past
two years and eight months, and has been seeking to create a
favorable climate for the resumption of cross-strait talks, which
were unilaterally suspended by Beijing in July, 1995 after a visit to
the United States by President Lee Teng-hui, the MAC head said.</P>
      <P>Welcoming the ARATS response to the SEF proposal, he expressed
the hope that the current low ebb in cross-strait exchanges will soon
warm up.</P>
      <P>The SEF and the ARATS are the quasi-official organizations
authorized by Taipei and Beijing respectively to handle bilateral
exchanges in the absence of formal contacts between the two sides of

      <P>The number of visitors coming to
Singapore dropped for the fourth month in a row in January as a
result of the regional currency turmoil and economic slowdown.</P>
      <P>However, the Chinese New Year holidays brought a ray of sunshine
to the gloomy Singapore tourism industry with a sharp rise in
visitors from Hong Kong, Taiwan and mainland China, the Singapore
Tourism Board said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Only 509,752 tourists came to Singapore in January, a 16.7
percent plunge over the same month last year, it reported.</P>
      <P>This is the steepest drop since October last year, when visitor
arrival figures started plummeting for the first time in 14 years.</P>
      <P>Last October, visitor arrivals plunged 17.6 percent against the
figure for October 1996 as a result of the regional financial crisis
and the smoke haze.</P>
      <P>In November, the figure was 10.7 percent lower and in December,
15 percent.</P>
      <P>Singapore's top three tourist markets -- Indonesia, Japan and
Malaysia -- all showed double-digit declines in January.</P>
      <P>The number of ASEAN visitors went down almost 15 percent.</P>
      <P>The market that shrank the most was Japan. Holiday visitors fell
by 40 percent, while business visitors went down almost 35 percent.</P>
      <P>The Chinese New Year holidays, however, brought more visitors
from Hong Kong, Taiwan and mainland China, the tourism board said.</P>
      <P>The number of Hong Kong visitors climbed almost 45 percent, while
visitors from Taiwan rose 13 percent and from mainland China by 10
percent, it added.</P>
      <P>The regional economic crisis has also resulted in a marginal fall
of 0.4 percent in the average standard room rate in hotels to S$148

      <P>Singaporeans' spending on overseas trips
amounted to S$6.3 billion (US$3.8 billion) last year, compared to
S$5.7 billion in 1996, according to figures from the Singapore
Department of Statistics.</P>
      <P>Despite any effect the regional financial crisis might have at
home, they spent 11 percent more in 1997 on overseas trips, which
were mainly in the turmoil-hit regional countries where the Singapore
dollar's buying power stretched further.</P>
      <P>As a share of Singapore's overall consumption at S$49.5 billion
in 1997, 12.6 percent was due to overseas spending, up from 12.2
percent in 1996 and 11.5 percent in 1992.</P>
      <P>Regional currency crisis or not, Singaporeans certainly were not
on an austerity drive last year.</P>
      <P>They spent 6.7 percent more year-on-year on food, clothing, rent,
utilities, furnishing, medical bills, transport, recreation and
education, according to the figures.</P>
      <P>The figures also showed that Singaporeans spent S$7.6 billion or
1.3 percent more on food and beverages, 5.7 percent more on rent and
utilities (S$6.6 billion), 5.9 percent more on furniture and
household equipment (S$4.4 billion) and 1.1 percent more on
recreation and education (S$7.7 billion).</P>
      <P>But transport and communications spending dipped 1.8 percent to
S$7.9 billion.</P>
      <P>The strength of the Singapore dollar vis-a-vis regional
currencies is likely to result in increases in Singaporeans'
expenditures abroad, noted the Singapore Ministry of Trade and
Industry in its economic survey report.</P>
      <P>The Singapore dollar gained 4.1 percent against a trade-weighted
basket of currencies -- including the Malaysian ringgit, Thai baht
and South Korean won -- from last July to the end of last year.</P>
      <P>But the Indonesian rupiah had fallen nearly 70 percent against
the Singapore dollar since last July 1, while the ringgit, baht and
the Philippine peso were down by between 20 percent and 30 percent.</P>
      <P>The number of outbound trips Singaporeans made by air rose an
average of 13 percent annually between 1991 and 1997.</P>
      <P>For the first 10 months of last year, Singaporeans made 1.8
million overseas trips by air, compared to 2.2 million trips in the
whole of 1996 and 2 million in 1995.</P>
      <P>Besides losing Singaporean customers, the double-whammy for
Singapore retailers is that tourists visiting Singapore spent just
S$8.2 billion here last year -- 11 percent less than their 1996
shopping bill of S$9.2 billion, the report said, adding that was
already 4.8 percent lower than tourist spending here in 1995.</P>
      <P>Tourist spending was just 16.5 percent of overall consumption in
1997, down from 19.8 percent in 1996 and 22.3 percent in 1995,
according to the statistics.</P>

      <P>Peng Pai-shien, who took over leadership of the agricultural

      <P>Peng said that the annual revenue of Nantou County stood at just
NT$2.1 billion approximately, but payroll spending for local
government employees costs NT$420 million per month, a total of NT$5

      <P>The Ministry of Education (MOE) of the
Republic of China is aggressively pushing for recognition of academic
degrees conferred by academic institutions in mainland China, paving
the way for Taiwan students to legally seek higher education in
mainland China.</P>
      <P>The initiative is scheduled to take effect at the end of June
after being approved by the Executive Yuan, MOE officials said.</P>
      <P>With the approval of the mutual-recognition initiative, local
high school students interested in studying in mainland China should
feel more confident, as academic degrees from 73 colleges and
universities on the other side of the Taiwan Strait will be
recognized by Taiwan authorities from this year onwards, according to
the MOE.</P>
      <P>Most of these mainland degrees will require only a screening of
the relevant document by the MOE. Graduates of mainland Chinese
institutes' programs in medicine, dentistry and traditional Chinese
medicine, however, will be required to pass another scholastic test
in addition to the MOE screening, ministry officials said.</P>
      <P>Degrees held by mainland Chinese people who have settled in
Taiwan will also be recognized by Taiwan authorities after the

      <P>During his tour of the industrial park, Lien visited a
Taiwan-owned textile company in the park.</P>
      <P>On Wednesday afternoon, Lien left Amman for the ancient city of
Petra in southern Jordan for a sightseeing journey.</P>
      <P>Petra, an ancient city carved in the stone, was once the
stronghold of an Arab tribes, known as the Nabataeans. It is now a
tourist attraction noted for its massive architecture and the
ingenuity of its pools, dams and water channels.</P>
      <P>Lien toured the Dead Sea and Mt. Madaba, where prophet Moses
reportedly disappeared, and several other historic relics in the
region.</P>
      <P>Lien and his entoruage are scheduled to return to Amman on
Thursday and will leave Jordan for an undisclosed destination Friday
morning.</P>
      <P>Accompanied by his wife and several ROC officials, Lien arrived
in Amman on Monday for a private visit. He received an honorary
doctoral degree in social sciences from the University of Jordan on
Tuesday. On that evening, Jordanian Crown Prince Al Hassan Bin Talal
hosted a dinner in honor of Lien and his entoruage.</P>
      <P>This is Lien's first visit to Jordan. Despite the absence of
formal diplomatic ties between the two countries, Jordan has been
friendly toward the ROC. ROC President Lee teng-hui made a private
visit to Jordan in 1995.</P>
      <P>Previous press reports had said Lien would travel to Lebanon and
Bahrain after concluding his visit to Jordan. But the latest reports
from Beirut said Lien has canceled his planned trip to Lebanon
because of strong pressure from mainland China.</P>
      <P>Lien was also reportedly scheduled to make a stopover in the
Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur on his way home to discuss with
senior Malaysian officials feasible cooperative measures to address
the current Asian financial turmoil. However, Beijing's sabotage has
now caused Lien's itinerary following his Jordan visit to become
uncertain.</P>
      <P>Beijing has been waging an extensive campaign against Taipei's
diplomatic activities in an attempt to isolate the ROC in the
international community. Against his backdrop, senior ROC officials
often have to keep their overseas travel plans secret.</P>
      <P>Despite Beijing's pressure, Lien still had managed to visit
several major countries which do not maintain formal diploamtic ties
with the ROC in the past few years, including the Czech Republic,
Austria, Ukraine, Iceland and Ireland. The current Middle East
visit is Lien second trip abroad so far this year. He visited
Singapore in January.</P>
      <P>On his Middle East visit, Lien is being accompanied by his wife
and several senior government officials and close aides, including
Minister Without Portfolio Yang Shih-chien and Deputy
Secretary-General to the President Su Chi. Lien is scheduled to
return to Taipei on March 4.</P>

    <DATELINE>Singapore,  Feb.  26  (CNA)
(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Singaporeans should be prepared for
severe haze, as forest fires in East Kalimantan, Indonesia, have
reached a serious level, Singapore Environment Minister Yeo Cheow
Tong said on Wednesday at the end of an ASEAN Environment Ministers'
Meeting on the Haze held in Kuching, Indonesia.</P>
      <P>Malaysia and Indonesia have been urged by ASEAN to activate a
bilateral plan that could see Malaysian firefighters and equipment
being sent to Indonesia, The Straits Times reported on Thursday in a
dispatch from Kuching.</P>
      <P>ASEAN also welcomed immediate international help in fire-fighting
efforts, the report said.</P>
      <P>Yeo said that Singapore will offer equipment if necessary.</P>
      <P>Although the current situation in East Kalimantan is still not as
bad as last year, Indonesian Environment Minister Sarwono
Kusumaatmadja said that only extensive rains can put the fires out
completely, as help will only mitigate the situation, the report
said.</P>
      <P>He said that cloud seeding was starting in East Kalimantan on
Thursday to help bring rain to the region, which has seen only scant
rainfall in recent months.</P>
      <P>"We have had some success in ground and airborne operations, but
the fires in the damaged forests are hard to control," Sarwono was
quoted as saying.</P>
      <P>On the situation in Sarawak, Malaysia's Science, Technology and
Environment Minister Law Hieng Ding said that the fires there were
already under control, the report said.</P>
      <P>About 200 firefighters, together with water-bombing aircraft and
helicopter surveillance, were being used, he said.</P>
      <P>Turning to what still needs to be done, Yeo said that aside from
containing the present fires and fighting them at source, enforcement
against illegal burning must be stepped up to ensure that no new
man-made fires are created, the report said.</P>
      <P>At the same time, Malaysia and Indonesia can press on with
bilateral efforts to fight the fires and identify what additional
resources are needed, from the region as well as internationally, he
added.</P>

      <P>Beijing won't oppose Taipei's bid to join
the World Trade Organization (WTO) as long as it doesn't gain
membership first, according to reports from the Geneva-based world
trade body on Thursday.</P>
      <P>"Beijing is firmly opposed to Taipei's entry into the WTO ahead

Taiwan can accede only after Beijing puts together its own successful
bid. "The Beijing question should be settled first," the WTO report

      <P>Taiwan's bid to enter the WTO got a boost last Friday after the
US agreed to support Taiwan's application. Washington's decision
followed market-opening concessions on the part of Taiwan that will
lead to more imports of US products.</P>
      <P>Entry to the WTO -- and the international recognition membership

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  26  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A campaign to save endangered tigers in
northeastern mainland China was launched here on Thursday by a
Taiwan-based foundation.</P>
      <P>The Hope Fund, founded by former Olympic silver medalist Chi
Cheng, said at a press conference that there are only about 5,000
wild tigers left in the world, while the population of mainland
China's indigenous northeastern Chinese tiger has been reduced to
only about 300 and is listed as an endangered animal by the
Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES).</P>
      <P>The northeastern Chinese tiger, the biggest of all tigers, weighs
on average between about 180 kg to 300 kg, although some can grow to
more than 400 kg. An adult tiger consumes 6 kg to 12 kg of food per
day.</P>
      <P>In order to conserve the northeastern Chinese tiger, which is
high on Beijing's list of protected animals, the fund launched a
campaign in Taiwan to "adopt" tiger cubs at NT$1,200 apiece.</P>
      <P>The money will go to the tiger conservation center in mainland
China's "tiger city," Hailin, in Heilongjiang Province, in the
mainland's northeast.</P>
      <P>In order to allow the tigers to keep their ability to hunt and
eventually live on their own in the wild, the conservation center
feeds the tigers with beef and chickens only once a week.</P>
      <P>It costs the center about NT$120,000 (US$3,750) per year to take
care of one northeastern Chinese tiger, according to the foundation.</P>
      <P>"Conservation of the tiger will allow our descendants to one day
see these magnificent creatures in their wild habitat, rather than
only in books or on the screen," said the foundation's press release.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PROVINCIAL ASSEMBLY AGAIN DELAYS DECISION ON BAYER LAND LEASE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 26 (CNA)
(By Lin Wen-fen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan Provincial Assembly on Thursday
decided to once again delay their decision on a land lease contract
which would allow German chemical giant Bayer to build a plant in
central Taiwan's Taichung County.</P>
      <P>Assembly speaker Liu Ping-wei announced at 6:40 p.m. that
discussion of the land lease contract will be delayed until March 6,
following hours of heated confrontation on the floor of the assembly.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, nearly 1,000 protesters gathered outside the
assembly, waving banners and making speeches to voice their strong
opposition to the proposed toluene di-isocyanate (TDI) plant near
Taichung Harbor.</P>
      <P>A 1,500-strong police force was deployed outside the assembly
building to maintain order, but as the pro-Bayer investment group
didn't mobilize their supporters on this occasion, the protest was
described as peaceful. Serious clashes between anti-Bayer protesters
and police units have broken out during previous meetings relating to
the project.</P>
      <P>The assembly meeting began at 10:55 a.m., nearly 90 minutes later
than scheduled, as assemblymen from the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) and
the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) first discussed
their strategies behind closed doors. The meeting was presided over
by Deputy Speaker Yang Wen-hsin.</P>
      <P>A bitter war of words erupted soon after DPP Assemblyman Yu
Cheng-dao accused his colleague Lin Chin-chun of the KMT of having
dinner with officials from land development companies during the
Chinese New Year holidays to discuss the possible allocation of
construction work for the project after Bayer's proposal cleared the
provincial assembly. Although he described Yu's accusation as an
insult, Lin stressed that if there is evidence to substantiate the
accusation, he would be willing to quit the post.</P>
      <P>Because of the bitter outburst, Yang had to adjourn the meeting,
which was reconvened at 3:35 p.m. The chaotic situation deteriorated
even further in the afternoon session, this time presided over by
Assembly Speaker Liu Ping-wei.</P>
      <P>Accusations of bribes paid by Bayer, allegedly NT$5 million for
one vote in exchange for support of the land lease contract, were
once again mentioned on the assembly floor. Serious clashes erupted
between KMT Assemblyman Chou Hsi-wei and his party colleague Yen
Ching-Piao when Chou pounded the table and demanded the discussion
should not be suspended, which prompted Yen to dash over to where
Chou was standing, with the apparent intention of attacking him.</P>
      <P>It is the second time in less than two weeks that the Taiwan
Provincial Assembly has decided to delay the decision on whether or
not to grant the land lease to the international chemical giant for
its proposed NT$50 billion project. As Bayer has set a February
deadline for a decision on the investment project that it began two
years ago, the delay is being seen as a heavy blow to the prospects
of the project going ahead. The government is anxious to secure the
deal as a showcase for the plan to establish the island as a regional
operational hub.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for Bayer Taiwan said on Thursday night that the
result of the assembly meeting has been reported to company
headquarters in Germany. Whether or not Bayer is willing to extend
its deadline until March 6 has yet to be decided by the headquarters,
he added.</P>
      <P>Chen Chia-chung said that the company headquarters will convene a
meeting to make a decision on its first investment project in Taiwan.
The response of the Bayer's headquarters to the assembly's decision
can be expected on Friday at the soonest, he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GOVERNOR SOONG POLLED AS BEST CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENCY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  26  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The results of a recent survey show that
Taiwan Provincial Governor James Soong is the most popular candidate
for Taiwan's next presidency.</P>
      <P>The telephone survey carried out by the Taipei-based CommonWealth
Magazine in its March edition points out that Soong has an average
47.9 percent support from residents islandwide, far ahead of Taipei
Mayor Chen Shui-bian's 22 percent, Vice President Lien Chan's 5.5
percent and Premier Vincent Siew's 3.6 percent.</P>
      <P>The survey results, which sampled 1,144 residents in northern,
central, southern and eastern Taiwan on Feb.7-8, indicate that Soong
enjoys widespread backing among the people of Taiwan, regardless of
which region or ethnic group they belong to.</P>
      <P>Although Chen has long sought to build his image in northern
Taiwan, the survey found that he enjoys only 18.3 percent support in
the region, while Soong wins nearly 50 percent from each of the four
regions.</P>
      <P>The survey also discovered that the people of Taiwan are more
concerned with public security, household and educational issues than
with political and foreign policy matters.</P>
      <P>The household category is listed for the first time as one of the
public's top three issues of major concern, a reflection that the
island's residents are increasingly worried about their personal
safety and family lives amid deteriorating public order, the
devaluation of the New Taiwan dollar resulting from the recent
financial crisis plaguing the Asian region, and the widening gap
between rich and poor.</P>
      <P>About 50 percent of the respondents think it is safe to live in
Taiwan, while 27 percent have the opposite opinion, according to the
poll.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, nearly 70 percent of the people said they think the
gap between rich and poor will continue to increase, and they are
afraid their incomes will be swallowed up by the get-rich-quick
schemes which are now so popular on the island.</P>
      <P>Of the four members of the greater Chinese economic sphere --
Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, and mainland China -- 65 percent of the
people of Taiwan have the impression that Singapore is the best of
the four, ahead of 22 percent which chose Taiwan. Some 7 percent and
2 percent said they have the impression that Hong Kong and mainland
China, respectively, are the best of the four areas.</P>
      <P>Citing analyses made by academics, the monthly magazine said the
worsening social order, money politics, dirty environment, and the
lack of moral values are the prime reasons behind the local peoples'
admiration for Singapore.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NEW CBC GOVERNOR VOWS TO KEEP PRICES AND EXCHANGE RATES STABLE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  26  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vowing to maintain the stability of both
prices and local currency, the new Governor of the Central Bank of
China (CBC), Peng Huai-nan, was sworn in on Thursday, filling the
vacancy left by the tragic death on Feb. 16 of former Governor Sheu
Yuan-dong in Taiwan's worst-ever air crash.</P>
      <P>However, the governor excluded energy and vegetable prices from
the "Core Inflation Index" which he pledged to defend.</P>
      <P>At the swearing-in ceremony, Peng noted the time lapse between
the implementation of monetary policies and the time when their
effects are felt, and pledged to monitor leading indicators such as
the import prices and labor unit and capacity factor costs, which are
closely related to prices, and to adjust monetary policies
accordingly.</P>
      <P>With regard to maintaining currency stability, Peng said this
does not mean fixing the exchange rate of the New Taiwan dollar, but
rather keeping it within reasonable bounds.</P>
      <P>In order to shield the currency from short-haul fluctuations
caused by speculation, Peng said the CBC will provide the financial
markets with accurate information in a timely manner.</P>
      <P>Emphasizing his respect for market forces, the new CBC governor
said that the bank will intervene in the financial market only in
case of seasonal or occasional imbalances between demand and supply.</P>
      <P>He also promised to cooperate with the Ministry of Financial
Affairs to tighten up financial discipline and improve the health of
the nation's banking system.</P>
      <P>Peng said the CBC would also like to stimulate the development of
the economy but only to the extent compatible with the aforementioned
goals.</P>
      <P>He said that the bank will bring more outside scholars and
experts onto its boards of directors and supervisors to promote the
transparency of its policymaking process.</P>
      <P>Peng, chairman of the International Commercial Bank of China and
a former CBC deputy governor, is renowned for his hardline attitude
against speculative international money dealers.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, responding to Peng's appointment, the NT dollar surged

      <P>The latest round of talks between Taiwan
and the European Union (EU) on the island's terms for entry into the
World Trade Organization (WTO) ended here on Thursday evening with a
partial consensus having been reached.</P>
      <P>After three days of negotiations, delegates of the two sides have

      <P>Further rounds of talks will be necessary if any of the EU

      <P>The delegates at the Taipei talks, however, failed to resolve
their differences on the "monopoly benefit" (charges) on European

    <HEADLINE>PYONGYANG THREATENS TO SUE TAIPOWER IF NUCLEAR DEAL STALLS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  27  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>North Korea has threatened to file a
complaint with the International Court if Taiwan Power Company
(Taipower) fails to fulfill the contract it signed with Pyongyang in
January 1997.</P>
      <P>Pyongyang has on several occasions expressed its concern to
Taipower's Nuclear Backend Management Department over the
implementation of the contract, under which Taipower will ship 60,000
barrels of low-grade radioactive waste to North Korea over a two-year
period for permanent storage.</P>
      <P>As no action has been taken by Taipower during the past year,
Pyongyang is becoming increasingly concerned over the stalled deal,
and has threatened to sue Taipower for nonfulfillment of the
contract.</P>
      <P>Taipower authorities, however, argue that the company has been
carrying out its end of the agreement step by step over the past
year.</P>
      <P>The contract is still valid even though not a single barrel of
the company's nuclear waste has been sent northward to date, Taipower
officials said, adding that the approval process for an export
license has been delayed by the Cabinet-level Atomic Energy Council
(AEC).</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs has recently asked the AEC, the
supervisory body for nuclear-related affairs, to speed up the
handling of relevant matters for which it is responsible.</P>
      <P>According to the Taipower-Pyongyang agreement, Taipower will
begin to ship the waste once Taipower obtains an export license and
the Pyongyang company receives an import permit.</P>
      <P>Pyongyang first contacted Taipower in 1996, offering a parcel of
land near a North Korean seaport to Taipower for use as a nuke waste
receptacle.</P>
      <P>The North Korean offer was viewed favorably by Taipower for the
reasonable price, not-too-distant location and the convenience of not
needing to pass through a third country for the shipment, Taipower
officials noted.</P>
      <P>The Taipower-Pyongyang deal, however, has sparked a storm of
protest from South Korea, whose objections might account for the
AEC's slowdown of the permit screening process.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taipower's plans to store low-radioactive toxins in
Russia, mainland China and the Marshall Islands have also hit snags
because of a wide variety of problems.</P>
      <P>Against that backdrop, Taipower has refocussed its search on
domestic locations.</P>
      <P>The company on Thursday presented its latest proposal to the AEC,
identifying sites it considers suitable for receptacles. Six initial
locations were selected in order of preference: Hsiaowuchiu in Kinmen
County; Hsiaolanyu, an offshore islet near Taitung in eastern Taiwan,
Nantien Village in Taitung County; Tungchiyu in Penghu; Pengchiayu,
off Keelung in northern Taiwan; and Hsuhai Village in coastal
Pingtung County.</P>
      <P>Hsiaowuchiu, the first choice on Taipower's list, will be awarded
NT$2.1 billion (US$64.6 million) as compensation if the nuclear waste
dumping plan is implemented, according to Taipower officials.</P>
      <P>Another NT$900 million (US$27.6 million) will be presented to the
Kinmen County government, the administrative authority for
Hsiaowuchiu, as a goodwill gesture.</P>
      <P>Taipower's proposal, however, will remain on the drawing board
for the time being, according to AEC officials. No concrete moves
will be taken before public safety investigations and environmental
assessments have been conducted, they added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, indignant over Taipower's designation of Hsiaowuchiu
as its choice site for the nuclear storage plan, Kuomintang
Legislator Chen Ching-pao, a representative from Kinmen, staged
another protest Friday at the Legislative Yuan, his third in the past
week.</P>

    <DATELINE>Bangkok,  Feb. 27 (CNA)
(By Kuo Fang-chih &amp; Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of Taiwan banking executives have
urged Thailand to open its doors to private Taiwan banks, a move they
say could help the country rid itself of the onslaught by the recent
financial storm.</P>
      <P>Representatives from Taipei-based banks, including the
International Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), Chinatrust Commercial
Bank and First Commercial Bank (FCB), sounded the call during a
conference sponsored by a Thai-language economic newspaper in Bangkok
on Thursday.</P>
      <P>The banking executives said Thailand's opening for the
establishment of branch units by foreign banks would contribute to
more efficient financial and monetary services in the country. They
indicated that Taiwan's expertise and up-to-date technologies in
financial management could help rescue local businesses as well as
Taiwan companies operating in Thailand from difficulties caused by
the regionwide economic volatility.</P>
      <P>An ICBC manager stationed here further suggested that the Thai
financial sector should set up a joint credit information center to
provide a complete paper credit database for reference by all Thai
and foreign banking institutions which are willing to provide loans
for companies in need of financial aid.</P>
      <P>The information center could also reduce the risk of bounced
checks, which is seen as one of the major culprits in the financial
turmoil afflicting the Southeast Asian nation, he said.</P>
      <P>A Chinatrust representative said a more liberalized financial
sector is the only road to take Thailand out of its recession. He
also pointed out that there are more private and foreign banks in
Taiwan than in Thailand, which allows for a greater diversity of
services and more benefitial competition.</P>
      <P>The banking executive cited Taiwan's sound financial structure as
being the main factor behind the island's success in emerging
relatively unscathed from the regional financial attack.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, there are currently nine state-run banks and 37
private banks, while a total of 45 foreign banks have opened
representative and branch offices on the island, according to the
Chinatrust executive.</P>
      <P>At present, five state-run banks, 15 private institutions and 21
foreign concerns operate in Thailand, which continues to ban foreign
banks from opening more than one branch office in the country, he
said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US LAUDS ROC'S ANTI-DRUG DRIVE, BUT STILL LISTS IT AS TRANSIT POINT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Feb.  26 (CNA)
(By Jay Chen and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Clinton administration has lauded
the Republic of China on Taiwan for an aggressive anti-drug campaign
in its 1998 international narcotics control report, but it still
lists Taiwan as a transit point for contraband drugs.</P>
      <P>Taiwan, like Hong Kong and mainland China, ranks among the 22
major illicit drug producing and/or transit countries/dependent
territories that "have cooperated fully with the United States, or
have taken adequate steps on their own, to achieve full compliance
with the goals and objectives of the 1988 United Nations Convention
Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic
Substances," according to the report released by the White House on
Friday.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the US Department of State also issued a statement
explaining why it has continued to identify Taiwan as a significant
transit point for drug trafficking.</P>
      <P>The statement said, "Given trafficking patterns in the region and
Taiwan's role as a shipping center, the US believes Taiwan remains a
transit point for drugs significantly affecting it."</P>
      <P>While Taiwan authorities dispute this assessment, the statement
argued, there is no disagreement that individuals from Taiwan
continue to be involved in international narcotics trafficking.</P>
      <P>The statement pointed out that some 67 percent of all drugs
smuggled into Taiwan are believed to come from mainland China.</P>
      <P>It went on to say that, whatever their belief about Taiwan's
transit role, Taiwan authorities continue to mount an aggressive
counternarcotics campaign that involves both social rehabilitation
programs and harsh sentences for narco-trafficking.</P>
      <P>"Although Taiwan is not a UN member and cannot be a signatory to
the 1988 UN Drug Convention, it tries to meet Convention goals
regarding precursor chemicals via an active program to control the
products of its large chemical industry," the statement noted.</P>
      <P>In addition, the statement said, Taiwan has come to recognize
that money laundering is a growing problem. "In 1997, a Money
Laundering Prevention Center was established under the auspices of
the Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau (MJIB)."</P>
      <P>The statement further said cooperation between American and
Taiwan law enforcement agencies continued to expand in 1997.
Officials with the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and
Financial Crimes Enforcement Network have led training seminars for
their Taiwan counterparts and have broadened their range of contacts
within Taiwan's law enforcement community.</P>
      <P>It recognized that Taiwan has generally responded positively and
constructively to US requests on counternarcotics issues. With the
opening of its Money Laundering Prevention Center, it said, Taiwan
has started sharing with American law enforcement officials
Taiwan-originated information related to money laundering cases where
the flow of money leads to the United States. In addition, Taiwan's
MJIB officers assisted DEA agents with a case involving a shipment of
drugs to Guam.</P>
      <P>The statement also said Taiwan's anti-drug crackdown led to a
19.1 percent increase in drug convictions in the first 10 months of
1997 over all of 1996. Drug seizures also increased. The Money
Laundering Prevention Center pursued investigations in all 360 cases
of reported suspicious transactions. In the past year, the statement
said, Taiwan has also continued to prosecute cases of public
corruption. "There are, however, no known cases of official
involvement in narcotics trafficking," it noted.</P>
      <P>According to the US Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, the White
House is required to submit a report to Congress on major illicit
drug producing and/or transit countries annually. Countries or areas
which are certified as "failing to meet the standards" set forth in
section 490 (b) of the 1961 Act will be deprived of any US aid. Such
countries listed in the 1998 report include Afghanistan, Burma, Iran
and Nigeria.</P>
      <P>Drug producing and/or transit countries which are regarded as
"having cooperated with the US in fighting illicit trafficking" are
still eligible to receive US aid. The three Chinese economies --
Taiwan, Hong Kong and mainland China -- are all included in this
category in the 1998 report.</P>
      <P>Observers said even though Taiwan doesn't need US aid, its
inclusion in any such list is a minus to Taiwan's international
image.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>An ROC naval vessel collided with a private
fishing boat off the coast of Penghu County on Thursday night, but
there were no reports of injuries, the Navy General Headquarters
(NGH) said on Friday.</P>
      <P>The destroyer No. 909 collided with the Taipei County-based Chuan
Sheng No. 36 fishing boat in waters some 20 nautical miles north of
Penghu's Hsiyu township at around 9:35 p.m. when it was on a routine
patrol mission, the NHG said in a press release.</P>
      <P>None of the crew members aboard either the warship or the fishing
boat was injured, the statement said, adding that the fishing boat
already arrived at a military wharf in Penghu County, located off
Taiwan's southwestern coast, under the escort of a naval rescue ship
early Friday morning for repair and damage assessment.</P>
      <P>Initial investigations show that two ribs of the naval ship were
damaged in the collision, while the fishing boat sustained damage to
its bow, naval officials said.</P>
      <P>The officials said bad weather and poor visibility might have
contributed to the accident. Nevertheless, they admitted that further
investigations are needed to find out the cause and determine which
party, if any, should be held responsible for the collision.</P>
      <P>The military and other relevant government agencies will form a
joint task force to investigate the case.</P>
      <P>Seven crew members, including five from mainland China, were
aboard the fishing boat when the accident occurred.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN, EU REACH CONSENSUS ON MOST ISSUES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 27 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The European Council of Commerce and Trade
said on Friday that though minor differences remain between Taiwan
and the European Union (EU) on the terms for the island's accession
into the World Trade Organization (WTO), both sides greatly narrowed
the gap between their positions during the latest round of talks.</P>
      <P>EU officials noted that although the two sides did not resolve
all their differences in the most recent round of talks, the 12th,
Taiwan and the EU spoke fully on all outstanding issues.</P>
      <P>On Thursday, Chen Ruey-lung, director general of the Board of
Foreign Trade (BOFT), and EU negotiator Jean-Pierre de Laet reached a
consensus on the opening of Taiwan's service sector and a timetable
on cutting the island's tariffs and commodity taxes.</P>
      <P>But both sides have yet to agree on the tariffs on imported
vehicles and the monopoly tax on imported whiskey.</P>
      <P>During the three-day talks, Taiwan agreed to reduce its average
tariff for industrial products to 4.7 percent by 2004.</P>
      <P>In the service sector, foreign investors in Taiwan's banks will
receive national treatment according to the related law, which is
that a shareholder cannot hold more than 5 percent of a domestic
bank. Foreign companies, however, will be able to set up wholly-owned
commercial banks.</P>
      <P>Both sides also agreed that the ceiling of foreign investment in
air cargo forwarding services will be lifted fully from the present
50 percent on reciprocal principles.</P>
      <P>On marine services, Taiwan agreed that foreign companies can set
up subsidiaries or affiliates. They are presently limited to
branches.</P>
      <P>The EU expressed its understanding that foreign investment in the
island's telecommunications sector should not exceed 20 percent after
Taiwan's entry into the WTO.</P>
      <P>Taiwan also explained that it no longer issues operation licenses
for trust investment companies.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has agreed that upon its entry into the WTO, it will
review its regulations concerning foreign lawyers practicing on the
island and will study partnership relations between foreign and local
lawyers three years after gaining WTO membership.</P>
      <P>Both sides, however, still disagree on the cutting of monopoly
taxes on European liquors and tariff cuts on imported automobiles.</P>
      <P>Taiwan agreed that it will cut its monopoly tax on brandy to less
than NT$750 (US$23) but has yet to agree on how much its tariff on
whiskey will be reduced.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CROSS-STRAIT RELATIONS BEGIN TO THAW  (1)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 27 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A positive response from Beijing on Tuesday
to an appeal from Republic of China Premier Vincent Siew is being
seen as a signal that frosty relations across the Taiwan Strait have
begun to thaw.</P>
      <P>During his administrative report to the opening session of the
Legislature last week, Siew called for "collaborative cultivation"
of bilateral relations between Taiwan and the Chinese mainland. On
Tuesday, Taipei received what it termed a "positive" proposal from
Beijing, suggesting that preparations begin for political dialogue
and the restoration of negotiations on cross-strait technical issues.
Thus a warming of cross-strait relations, which have been frozen in
place for more than 30 months, appears near.</P>
      <P>More than 40 years of hostility between Taipei and Peking gave
way to an era of exchange and communication after the ROC government
in November 1987 began to allow people residing in the Taiwan area to
visit relatives on the Chinese mainland. This decision moved
cross-strait relations out of a state of complete estrangement and
opened the door for private-level exchanges.</P>
      <P>During the past 11 years, a rapid growth in economic, cultural
and social exchanges has been witnessed between the two sides.
However, due to differences in living conditions and social values
between Taiwan and the mainland, as well as the vastly disparate
political systems existing on the two sides, mutual relations have
hobbled forward along a rocky road.</P>
      <P>If the interaction among high-level leaders can serve as a
criterion for evaluating the state of two-way exchanges, it may well
be said that cross-strait amity reached a peak in the spring of 1995.
It was on the eve of the lunar new year in January 1995, that
mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin presented an "eight-point
proposal," while ROC President Lee Teng-hui responded by announcing
his "six-point statement" on April 8, 1995.</P>
      <P>However, on June 16, 1995, Beijing suspended a second meeting
between Koo Chen-fu, chairman of the Taipei-based Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF), and his counterpart, Wang Daohan, chairman of the
Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait
(ARATS), after Lee made a private but high-profile visit to the
United States. Thus cross-strait relations returned to the freezing
point.</P>
      <P>As it now appears that an improved atmosphere is once again
emerging, a better understanding of the reasoning on both sides can
be gained by examining the highlights of the cross-strait dialogue.</P>
      <P>On June 10, 1995, President Lee delivered a speech at Cornell
University, calling on Beijing to abandon confrontation and commit
itself to peaceful competition. The spokesman for mainland China's
Taiwan Affairs Office under the State Council, responded on June 16
by indefinitely postponing the second scheduled "Koo-Wang meeting,"
the first having taken place in Singapore in April 1993.</P>
      <P>Between July 21, 1995, and late November of that year, Beijing
conducted four separate series of military exercises, extending from
the East China Sea and Qingdao, Shandong Province, in the north, to
the shores of Fujian Province in the south.</P>
      <P>President Lee declared on July 22, 1995, that the Republic of
China must be afforded its due status in the international community,
and called on the Beijing authorities to renounce ideological
confrontation in favor of a new era of peaceful competition among all
Chinese around the world.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Lee's speech at Cornell was harshly criticized by
mainland commentators in four articles published by the Xinhua News
Agency and the People's Daily between July 23-26.</P>
      <P>On Sept. 1, 1995, Lee told The New York Times that as soon as the
situation on the Chinese mainland stabilized, and after the
conclusion of presidential elections on Taiwan, the two sides could
consider rescheduling a high-level meeting.</P>
      <P>Jiang responded to Lee's remarks during an interview with the US
media during which he welcomed the ROC president to visit Beijing.
Asked whether he would visit Taipei if invited, Jiang added, "I would
like to."

    <HEADLINE>CROSS-STRAIT RELATIONS BEGIN TO THAW  (2)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  27  (CNA)
(By Chang Lung and Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>On Feb. 11, 1996, Lee remarked at his
presidential campaign headquarters in Taipei, that terminating enmity
and establishing peace across the Taiwan Strait would be the top
priority of the next president.</P>
      <P>Lee told the press at his Chinese New Year news conference
shortly thereafter that the first step toward alleviating tensions
between the two sides would be the signing of a peace accord.</P>
      <P>During the period before the March 23 presidential election,
however, the mainland news media poured out a massive number of
articles extremely hostile to Lee. In addition, Beijing held missile
exercises off the northeast and southwest coasts of Taiwan March
8-25, pushing cross-strait relations to a nadir.</P>
      <P>After the vote, in all his meetings with foreign visitors and
members of the international media, President-elect Lee reasserted
that the door for cross-strait negotiations is always open, adding
that while Taipei insists that there is only one China, the
government views this as post-unification China and not the People's
Republic of China. China has been divided and is under separate rule,
he consistently pointed out.</P>
      <P>Lee noted in his inaugural address on May 20, 1996 that Taipei
and Beijing should work seriously to end cross-strait hostility. He
went a step further by saying that he would like to make a "journey
of peace" to the Chinese mainland. The spokesman for mainland China's
Taiwan Affairs Office under the State Council responded by citing
Mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin's "Eight-point Proposal" that
the two sides could negotiate and reach an agreement on the
termination of cross-strait enmity under the premise of One-China.</P>
      <P>Jiang also responded on June 26, 1996, during a visit to Spain,
that he would welcome reciprocal visits by the leaders of both sides
of the Taiwan Strait. He reiterated this stance when he met with Le
Figaro, a French daily, in September 1996.</P>
      <P>In a report to the 15th National Congress of the Communist Party
of China on Sept. 12, 1997, Jiang urged the Taipei authorities to
"formally end hostilities under the principle of one-China" and to
reach an agreement with Beijing. Under the premise of one-China, he
said, everything can be discussed.</P>
      <P>At an administrative meeting of the Executive Yuan on Oct. 2,
1997, ROC Premier Vincent Siew welcomed the mainland's stance and
asked the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC), the nation's top agency in
charge of mainland policy, to map out the resumption of talks between
the SEF and ARATS, the semi-official organizations on either side of
the Taiwan Strait that were set up to deal with cross-strait affairs
in the absence of official ties.</P>
      <P>On Nov. 6, 1997, ARATS invited Chiao Jen-ho, then the vice
chairman and secretary-general of the SEF, to attend a seminar on
cross-strait economic relations scheduled to be held in December in
Xiamen, mainland China. The SEF responded with a suggestion that SEF
Chairman Koo Chen-fu lead the delegation instead. ARATS replied on
Nov. 11 with a counter-proposal for a meeting between Chiao and ARATS
Vice Chairman Tang Shubei.</P>
      <P>On Jan. 19, 1998, the SEF faxed a letter to ARATS for the second
time about Koo's visit; ARATS answered that its letter dated Nov. 11,
still held good, meaning that ARATS had not changed its stance.</P>
      <P>Siew remarked in his administrative report to the legislature on
Feb. 20 that the ROC government is "willing to eliminate enmity
through dialogue and replace confrontation with negotiation."</P>
      <P>"I think if we start from the second Koo-Wang talks, any agenda
that will help peaceful development across the strait and the
country's democratic unification can be proposed gradually in order
to start up communication and dialogue," he said.</P>
      <P>In the wake of Siew's strategic speech, ARATS faxed a letter on
Tuesday saying: "We welcome Mr. Koo Chen-fu to visit at an
appropriate time. Officials of an appropriate level can make the
necessary preparations for that through an exchange of visits."</P>

      <P>The ruling Kuomintang is not ruling out the
possibility of nominating a woman to run for Taipei mayor, KMT
Secretary-General John Chang said on Friday.</P>
      <P>Chang said that high-ranking KMT officials have exchanged views
on fielding a woman in the race and have taken several possible

      <P>Incumbent Taipei Mayor Chen Shui-bian announced earlier in the
week that he will seek a second term. Observers here believe he has a
good chance of winning, given his high ratings in opinion polls, and
that an electoral victory would pave the way for him to enter the
next presidential race.</P>
      <P>Chang has often been asked how the KMT could field a candidate
formidable enough to overcome Chen's popularity.</P>
      <P>"The KMT will not rule out any woman who has an outstanding
performance record and a very strong chance of winning the race," he
said Friday.</P>
      <P>On which women the KMT is considering, Chang said that he will
only discuss the candidate when the time is ripe.</P>
      <P>He stressed the KMT will carefully screen all possible candidates

      <P>Observers believe candidates under consideration include KMT Vice
Secretary-General Yeh Chin-feng, Taipei City Councilman Chin Huei-chu

      <P>The association also unveiled for the first time the three major
routes used by regional criminal rings for the smuggling of women
into sexual servitude.</P>
      <P>It said the rings would first smuggle women from Burma and Laos
into Thailand, where they would be forced to work as prostitutes;
three to six months later, the same women would be sent on to either
Singapore, Taiwan or Japan to continue their sexual services.</P>
      <P>The rings also smuggle women from mainland China into Thailand
via Burma and Laos; some of these women would then be sent to Taiwan,
either directly from Thailand or via Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>In some cases, Southeast Asian women are lured to Malaysia first,
before being sent on to either Singapore or the Philippines; some of
them also eventually end up in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The association said the rings usually place advertisements in
newspapers pretending to recruit women to work as waitresses, family
helpers, dancers or singers. Such ads usually stress that the work is
easy, does not need experience, and offers lucrative rewards.</P>
      <P>Sometimes, the association said, human smuggling rings disguise
themselves as matchmaking agencies to trick women into marrying
abroad. The victims soon come to understand that the men they are
supposed to marry are drivers or bodyguards hired by brothels and
other sex joints.</P>
      <P>The association pointed out that some travel agencies and
document forgery rings have colluded with the human smuggling rings,
providing travel papers and false passports.</P>
      <P>As immigration authorities have tightened inspection of passports
and travel documents, the criminal rings now seldom send women to
Taiwan by air. Instead, they smuggle the women into Taiwan via sea,
using small fishing boats or even jet skis to land on the island.</P>
      <P>The association also alleged that many taxi drivers collaborate
with brothels and sex joints to control the abused women, providing
transport or monitoring services.</P>
      <P>In most cases, the association said, the women have little
opportunity to escape because they have often been conned into
signing huge debt receipts and their passports are often confiscated
by the criminal rings. In addition, the rings often use drugs and
bodyguards to control their charges.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BLIND MAN BECOMES NATIONAL EXAM'S TOP SCORER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 27 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The first blind person ever allowed to take
the National Professionals and Technologists Examination has become
this year's top scorer.</P>
      <P>Lan Chieh-chou, 25, outperformed more than 3,000 other
contestants in this year's exam, earning a score of 65.23, well above
the 50 points required to pass and become a certified sociologist.</P>
      <P>Lan's examination rivals even included a number of university
professors of sociology who wished to obtain a national license to be
a sociologist.</P>
      <P>John Kuan, vice president of the Examination Yuan, visited Lan
Friday upon the announcement of the national examination results to
offer his congratulations.</P>
      <P>Although overjoyed by the triumph, Lan, a native of Tainan, said
words cannot describe his sad and difficult ordeal over the last 25
years.</P>
      <P>Lan was partially blind at birth because his mother had suffered
from German measles during pregnancy. As a child his sight was poor,
but he managed to lead a normal life.</P>
      <P>His fate took a turn for the worse, however, when he was 16 and
hit by retinopathy, which made him totally blind.</P>
      <P>Lan was sent to a school for the blind in Taichung, some 120
kilometers from his hometown.</P>
      <P>He was brave and persistent at his new school and managed to pass
the national college entrance examination. He entered National
Chunghsing University (NCU) at the age of 19.</P>
      <P>After graduating from NCU, Lan passed the national examination
for the handicapped and became a government employee at the
Supervisory Board for the Civil Servant Pension Fund, an agency under
the Ministry of Examination, where he was noticed by Lin Chi-yuan,
chairman of the Civil Service Protection and Training Commission.</P>
      <P>Prompted by Lan's hard work and diligence, Lin pushed for blind
people to be allowed sit in the national examination for
professionals and technologists. Lin's efforts succeeded, and this
year Lan was allowed to join the test takers.</P>
      <P>In addition to being an outstanding sociology expert, Lan is an
Internet devotee. He's enthusiastic about the World Wide Web and even
met his girlfriend there.</P>

    <HEADLINE>WTO CHIEF SPEAKS POSITIVELY ON TAIWAN'S MEMBERSHIP BID</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>San  Francisco,  Feb.  26 (CNA)
(By Neil Lu and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The director-general of the World
Trade Organization (WTO) said here on Thursday that Taiwan's
membership bid has proceeded smoothly.</P>
      <P>Renato Ruggiiero further said Taiwan's WTO bid has nothing to do
with mainalnd China's membership application.</P>
      <P>This was the first time that Ruggiiero has given such a
clear-cut positive review of Taiwan's WTO bid.</P>
      <P>Ruggiiero's latest remarks were seen yet another positive
development in Taiwan's WTO bid following the conclusion of its
lengthy, difficult bilateral talks with the United States on terms
for its entry into the Geneva-based world trade regulatory body.</P>
      <P>Ruggiiero, a former Italian foreign minister, is currently in
San Jose, California to attend a seminar on the current global
trading system.</P>
      <P>Asked whether mainland China would request for joining the WTO
ahead of Taiwan, Ruggiiero didn't make an explicit, direct reply. He
instead said Taiwan's WTO-related negotiations have been proceeding
smoothly and that its prospects of entering the organization are
rosy.</P>
      <P>The top manager of WTO's day-to-day affairs further siad he is
convinced that Taiwan will be able to resolve all WTO-related
problems within a reasonable period of time. By then, Ruggiiero
said, any other factor or pressure will disappear.</P>
      <P>Ruggiiero said the conclusion of negotiations with the United
States is a very important development in Taiwan's WTO bid.
Nevertheless, he said, Taiwan still has to finalize talks with other
WTO contracting parties. He declined to predict when Taiwan will be
formally admitted to the WTO.</P>
      <P>Teng Chen-chung, a division chief in charge of economic affairs
at Taiwan's representative office in Washington, D.C., has expressed
welcome to Ruggiiero's remarks on progress in Taiwan's WTO bid.</P>
      <P>Teng said the US has upheld its principle in separating Taiwan's
WTO application from mainland China's. "We hope the WTO will follow
suit and consider our membership bid purely from economic
viewpoints," he urged, adding that he hopes Taiwan's WTO bid will
not be hindered by any political interferences.</P>
      <P>Taiwan applied to join the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade (GATT) in 1990 as an independent customs territory, while
mainland China filed a similar application in 1986. The GATT was
superceded by the WTO in January 1995.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has completed bilateral WTO talks with 24 of the 26
contracting parties which have expressed intentions for such
consultations. It is scheudled to finalize simialr talks with the
15-member European Union and Switzerland before the end of March to
speed up its WTO accession.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN ECONOMY FLASHED 'YELLOW-BLUE' IN JANUARY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  27  (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's economy flashed a "yellow-blue"
light in a governmental rating system in January, the first time in
14 months that the signal has moved downward out of the "green" range
of steady growth, according to the Council for Economic Planning and
Development (CEPD).</P>
      <P>Declaring that January's indicator is not a warning of an
economic recession, a CEPD senior official attributed the lower level
signal mainly to the fact that there were fewer workdays that month
than usual due to the Chinese New Year holidays.</P>
      <P>This January had only 18 workdays, 21.7 percent fewer than the
23-day level of the same month last year.</P>
      <P>Domestic activities were hard-hit by last month's scarcity of
workdays, said Thomas M.F. Yeh, the CEPD's head of economic research.</P>
      <P>In the CEPD-devised five-color rating system, a "yellow-blue"
light signals an economic slowdown, while a "blue" light represents a
recession; "red" means the economy is overheated; "yellow-red" refers
to an economy that is heating up; and "green" reflects steady growth.</P>
      <P>In applying the system, the CEPD measures nine major areas of
economic activity: industrial production, manufacturing-sector
inventories, non-agricultural employment, export orders, export
value, the check default rate, M1B money supply, bank lending and the
stock index.</P>
      <P>The decreased number of workdays pulled down the measuring
indices in industrial production, manufacturing-sector inventories,
export orders and export value, according to the CEPD.</P>
      <P>Yeh said that according to anlayses of his council, the island's
economy is continuing stable development, and he urged people not to
be concerned by the "seasonal" rating result.</P>
      <P>The economic expert also revealed that the CEPD's recent survey
showed 23 percent of local manufacturing businesses predict Taiwan's
economy will be flourishing in three months, up from 19 percent in
the previous survey, marking most domestic enterprises are optimistic
about the country's economic future.</P>

(By S.C. CHANG)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The widely reported language fight between
Quebec's "tongue troopers" and businesspeople in Montreal's Chinatown
came to a halt after the former were ordered on Wednesday to back
off.</P>
      <P>Quebec has for now suspended plans to crack down on a lack of
French on commercial signs in Chinatown, the minister in charge of
the province's language policy said.</P>
      <P>Louise Beaudoin said she is convinced the apprehensions expressed
by business leaders in Chinatown were based on "misunderstanding and
a lack of communication" and that Quebec is ready to go a lot slower
in its approach to the issue.</P>
      <P>Her language inspectors were to crack down on shop owners who do
not put up signs with French "predominant" over other languages.
Ethnic Chinese businesspeople complained they were being "harassed"
and that changing the signs would be costly.</P>
      <P>Beaudoin did not say the issue was closed, indicating instead
that she was waiting for a report from a deputy minister who has been
meeting Chinese community leaders to find a compromise. She expected
the report sometime in March.</P>
      <P>Reaction from the community has been cautiously optimistic. "It's
OK for now," said Bill Wong, a restaurant owner and vice president of
the Chinese Chamber of Commerce. "I won't be happy about anything
until everything is dropped."</P>
      <P>He noted that "they are just suspending it," and reported that
his chamber's objective is that "it will not come back again."</P>
      <P>The controversy erupted last fall after the Commission de
Protection de la Langue Francaise targeted Chinatown in response to
complaints that signs there were in Chinese only or that the French
letters were not twice the size of Chinese characters.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EX-AUSSIE LEADER SEES ASIAN CRISIS TAKING DECADES TO RESOLVE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra, Feb. 27 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>John Hewson, former leader of Australia's
Liberal Party, predicted it will take one or two decades to resolve
the Asian economic crisis, saying that governments in the region and
their cronies will resist reforms and that the current bailouts by
the International Monetary Fund (IMF) will only cure short-term
economic problems in the region.</P>
      <P>In an article published in the Australian Financial Review on
Friday, Hewson, who lost the prime minister's post to Paul Keating in
1993, said he was surprised to see that many countries and leaders
regard the Asian problem as just a currency crisis that is relatively
short-term or cyclical.</P>
      <P>In fact, he said, the key structural weakness of many of the
affected Asian economies is the close, incestuous relationship
between government, business and the financial sector. This has not
only economic but also substantial political and social significance,
he added.</P>
      <P>"At its worst, it is corruption, cronyism and nepotism. At best,
banking is just an extension of government industry policy," Hewson
said.</P>
      <P>He said the solution to the Asian crisis is not just economic.</P>
      <P>"The underlying power structure (in the region's countries) will
have to be broken down. The corruption and cronyism will need to be
eradicated. Political processes will eventually become more
democratic. Social structures will have to become more equal," he
said.</P>
      <P>He cited Japan as an example. Japan's bubble burst back in 1990.</P>
      <P>"Yet today, eight years on, we still don't even know the full
extent of the debt problems, particularly of the banks, with the 'Big
Bang' deregulation of the financial sector due on April 1," he said.</P>
      <P>"Consumer and business confidence (in Japan) are shattered. The
near-term danger is yet another recession. The worst elements of
Japan Inc. have had to be exposed of corrupt practices, favors and
cronyism," he said.</P>
      <P>"Korea is very much a mini-Japan -- eight years later -- but with
apparently bigger debt problems and less transparent business,
government and banking practices," he said.</P>
      <P>"Indonesia is several stages further behind and its political and
social upheaval will be far more significant," he said.</P>
      <P>"The IMF bailouts only buy time -- in the long term they only
work if the correct and necessary reforms are put in place," he
noted.</P>
      <P>"Throughout this process, despite repeated commitments to the IMF
and the international community, (Asian) governments and their
cronies will resist change. They will fight to keep their privilege,
their power and to protect their vested interests," he said.</P>
      <P>"While there will be many false summers, as things seem to look
better for a time, the whole process will ultimately take a decade or
two," he added.</P>

(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The doping scandal surrounding a mainland
China swim team at the 8th World Championship in January in Perth,
Australia, not only puts mainland China's credibility in doubt, but
also raises the prospect of tougher crackdowns on more than 12,000
athletes expected to attend the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, leading
to the hope that the event will be remembered not only as a great
sporting event, but also a clean and fair one, organizers said.</P>
      <P>They said the seizure of human growth hormones from mainland
China swimmer Yuan Yuan, and the positive drug tests of four other
mainland China swimmers, has illustrated the seriousness of the
problem, not only in swimming competitions, but also in other sports.</P>
      <P>Yuan and the other four swimmers were banned from competing in
the World Swimming Championship in Perth, and the organizers said
they hoped the doping scandal would serve as a serious warning not
only for mainland China, but also for other countries.</P>
      <P>But Terry Gathercole, president of the Australian Swimming
Association, turned up the heat on mainland China this week during a
World Cup meeting in Beijing, reiterating the call for mainland China
to withdraw from international competition for a year -- not just in
swimming but in all sports.</P>
      <P>Gathercole has the backing of nearly all of the 19 other
participating swimming countries in the Beijing competition.</P>
      <P>Three Australian swimmers boycotted the Word Cup competition in
Beijing on Wednesday and Thursday as a protest against the host
country.</P>
      <P>They were followed by New Zealand, who did not send any swimmers
after competing in the Hong Kong leg of the World Cup last weekend.</P>
      <P>Sweden has stayed away, while the United States and Canada are
also absent.</P>
      <P>Australian swimmers said they had to boycott the Beijing
competition because if they took part, it would be tantamount to
supporting mainland China in light of their 29 positive drug results
in the past seven years -- more than all other swimming nations
combined.</P>
      <P>Gathercole was not only applying more heat on the Chinese on
Tuesday, he also said the recently announced 11-point anti-drugs plan
devised by a FINA delegation and the Chinese Swimming Association
(CSA) five days ago has not yet been formally adopted.</P>
      <P>The plan, which calls for a life ban, punishment of coaches,
suspension of Chinese clubs for a year if they have two positive
steroid or hormone cases within a 12-month period and monies won by
athletes to be put into trust accounts, is supposed to be backdated
to January 1, 1998.</P>
      <P>Gathercole said the plan could just be window-dressing.</P>
      <P>"The first proof will be if CSA adopts the FINA recommendations
but if they reject any, or the whole thing, then they are not being
as sincere as they should be and their credibility will be shot," he
said.</P>
      <P>The organizers of the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney said the
recent doping scandal in Perth should serve as a serious warning for
mainland China and a good reminder that Beijing must clean house in
all sports to avoid a repeat of a similar scandal in September 2000,
when the Olympic Games take place in Sydney.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BAYER STILL ASSESSING INVESTMENT IN TAICHUNG</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Bonn, Feb. 27 (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin and Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Germany-based Bayer Group on Friday fell
short of clarifying its decision over the fate of its controversial
proposal for a production plant for toluene di-isocyanate (TDI) in
Taichung Harbor, central Taiwan, saying only that the company is
still assessing the case.</P>
      <P>A Bayer executive in charge of international and Asia-Pacific
affairs said the company has not made a final decision over the TDI
investment project in Taiwan which on Thursday provoked clashes
between Taiwan Provincial Assembly deputies of the ruling Kuomintang
and the opposition Democratic Progressive Party over a proposed land
lease contract for the chemical giant.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Provincial Assembly announced on Thursday afternoon
that it will postpone the final vote over the land lease contract
until its next session, scheduled for March 6.</P>
      <P>It is understood that Bayer headquarters may make a final
announcement next week on whether or not it will withdraw the case
from Taiwan, one week later than a deadline of late February set
earlier by Bayer.</P>
      <P>After more than two years of arrangement and effort, the Bayer
Group announced in December that it was relocating its TDI investment
project from near Taichung Harbor to Texas as a result of strong
opposition from local residents over fears that the plant will
pollute the environment.</P>
      <P>But Bayer told a Taiwan delegation which visited the parent
company earlier this month that it is willing to keep the project in
Taiwan if the land lease contract can be approved by the end of this
month in the Taiwan Provincial Assembly.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a survey made public by the Cabinet-level Council for
Economic Planning and Development shows that a total of 64.8 percent
of the respondents (including 21.3 percent of those who agree with
the plan if safety measures can be fully implemented) are in favor of
Bayer's TDI investment in Taichung Harbor, while a similar level of
respondents think the residents of the four townships near the
proposed site should be entitled to decide the fate of the project.</P>
      <P>Another signal worth noting is that although most of the
respondents have confidence in Bayer's record in environmental
protection, they lack such faith in the ROC government's supervisory
capabilities.</P>
      <P>According to the poll, 61.1 percent of the respondents believe
that Bayer will fully implement safety and environmental protection
measures here, while at the same time, 53.5 percent said they do not

    <DATELINE>Hong Kong, Feb. 27 (CNA)
(By Wu Shean-shen &amp; Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Zhu Rongji, vice premier of the People's
Republic of China, is to be named premier, while the current Premier
Li Peng will be reassigned as chairman of the National People's
Congress, with formal approval being given at the 9th National
People's Congress which opens on Thursday, according to Hong Kong's
South China Morning Post newspaper.</P>
      <P>The newspaper said in its Friday edition that the reshuffle of
state leaders passed through the Central Committee of the Communist
Party of China in Beijing on Thursday.</P>
      <P>A reformed-minded economist, Zhu has been at the country's
economic helm for five years, and will face the challenge of boosting
domestic demand and halting deflation while avoiding stagflation, all
against the background of the regional economic crisis.</P>
      <P>Vice Premier Qian Qichen, who has been in charge of the country's
foreign affairs for a decade, is expected to remain in office for at
least another year, said the newspaper, noting that he has presided
over the handover of Hong Kong in July, President Jiang Zemin's US
visit in October and the recent rapprochement with the European Union
and pointing out that no one in Beijing's senior hierarchy has yet
been groomed to take his place.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Chinese-language Minpao newspaper, also Hong
Kong-based, said that Hu Jintao, the No.4 member of the CPC Political
Bureau, is expected to be named a vice president, while Wen Jiabao, a
member of the Political Bureau, and Wu Yi, minister of foreign trade
and economic cooperation, have been tipped to become new vice

    <HEADLINE>SINGAPORE  GOVERNMENT UNVEILS 1998 BUDGET</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore, Feb. 27 (CNA)
(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Singapore Government Friday unveiled
its budget for fiscal 1998, with revenue collection estimated at
S$29.9 billion and operating and development expenditures budgeted at
S$27.2 billion.</P>
      <P>The operating surplus for the period is expected to be S$2.7
billion or about 1.7 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP).</P>
      <P>As a percentage of GDP, the surplus is much lower than the 3.8
percent average of 1996 and 1997.</P>
      <P>The budget was presented in nearly two hours by Singapore Finance
Minister Hu Tsu Dow at a parliament session on Friday afternoon.</P>
      <P>Apart from the direct impact caused by the regional financial
turmoil, there are two other reasons for the smaller surplus, Hu
explained.</P>
      <P>One is a general slowdown in the growth of revenue collection due
to the cumulative effects of tax cuts introduced over the past 12
years. The other is the substantial rise in development expenditures
in recent years.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding the slower increase in revenues, Singapore's
revenue base remains robust and a deficit budget is not envisaged, he
said.</P>
      <P>Total government expenditure in fiscal 1998 is expected to
increase by 15 percent to S$27.2 billion, more than double the
expected nominal GDP growth rate, which will provide some fiscal
stimulus to the domestic economy, he said.</P>
      <P>Defense spending, education, infrastructure, economic
development, and communications will take up the lion's share of
government spending, Hu said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SINGAPORE TO BECOME ASIA'S PRIME FUND MANAGEMENT HUB</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  Feb.  26  (CNA)
(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Singapore Deputy Prime Minister Lee
Hsien Loong said on Friday that the government will develop Singapore
into Asia's premier fund management hub over the next five to 10
years.</P>
      <P>Addressing a seminar organized by the Investment Management
Association of Singapore (IMAS), he pointed out that "we start with
well-known advantages -- our reputation as a safe haven, our record
of political stability and macro-economic soundness, our
well-established airlinks, telecommunications network, and IT
(information technology) infrastructure."</P>
      <P>But, he added, Singapore also faces some natural constraints: a
small domestic market, and long geographic distances from the major
investment markets of America and Europe.</P>
      <P>"Our target is therefore twofold," he said. "First, to become a
center for managing the Asian investment portfolios of both Asian and
Western clients. And second, to manage global investments of clients
in Asia. The industry is already developing in this direction."</P>
      <P>He pointed out that Singapore's strategies for developing the
fund management industry focus on the following areas:</P>
      <P>First, to improve and streamline the regulatory structure for
fund managers and unit trusts.</P>
      <P>Singapore's financial criteria for obtaining an Investment
Adviser's (IA) license are set too high. This has kept smaller but
well-managed fund management companies of good repute out of
Singapore.</P>
      <P>Lee, who is also chairman of the Monetary Authority of Singapore
(MAS), said that MAS will reduce the minimum shareholders' funds
required for an IA license from S$500 million to S$100 million, and
lower the minimum amount of global funds that the parent company must
manage from S$5 billion to S$1 billion. However, the admission
criteria in terms of track record, management expertise, and
licensing status will remain.</P>
      <P>Second, to place substantially more GIC funds with private fund
managers based in Singapore.</P>
      <P>Since 1994, the GIC has been placing more funds with private fund
managers with offices in Singapore. So far, it has placed out a total
of S$10 billion.</P>
      <P>In the next three years, Lee said, the GIC will increase the
amount placed with fund managers with Singapore offices from S$10
billion to S$35 billion. This will comprise both global and regional
mandates.</P>
      <P>Third, to further liberalize the CPF (Central Provident Fund)
Unit Trust Scheme, and encourage CPF members to invest their savings
in CPF-approved unit trusts.</P>
      <P>Fourth, to enhance distribution channels for unit trusts.</P>
      <P>Improving distribution channels will give investors a wider
choice of unit trusts. It will promote competition among financial
institutions, and drive fees lower. The MAS will therefore permit
foreign fund managers in Singapore to market their products to
Singapore investors through local financial institutions.</P>
      <P>Fifth, to develop a broad range of domestic investible
instruments.</P>
      <P>Singapore is currently studying ways to develop its equity and
debt capital markets so as to make it the leading corporate funding
center in the region.</P>
      <P>Finally, to encourage a strong private sector role in promoting
the fund management industry.</P>
      <P>Lee pointed out that one strategy he had not touched upon was "to
use tax incentives to promote fund management."</P>
      <P>"We already have various tax incentives for this purpose, but
they can be further improved and enhanced," he said. "When we decide
on any changes, we will announce them."</P>

    <HEADLINE>SUSPECTS ARRESTED IN DOCTOR'S KIDNAP AND MURDER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 27 (CNA)
(By Lin Wen-fen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan police said on Friday that they have
arrested nine suspects wanted for the kidnap and murder of renowned
gynecologist Hsieh Cheng-hsien in southern Taiwan's Tainan city, but
warned that the man believed to be the mastermind behind the case
remains at large.</P>
      <P>Police said they arrested Chiu Sheng-lung late on Thursday night,
while another suspect, Chen Kuo-hsung, turned himself in early on
Friday morning. Their confessions helped the police to apprehend
another seven suspects, but the alleged mastermind, Tsai Cheng-hsien,
was not nabbed.</P>
      <P>Chen Kuo-hsung told police that in 1990, for unknown reasons,
Tsai and a group of gangsters vandalized Hsieh's Tainan City clinic.
Tsai was later listed as a hooligan by the police, partly because of
Hsieh's identification. A few days ago, Tsai accompanied his pregnant
wife to Hsieh's clinic, where he asked Hsieh to deliver their baby.
Upon recognizing Tsai, Hsieh refused to offer his services, whereupon
Tsai became enraged and decided to kidnap the doctor.</P>
      <P>Chen said that on Tuesday morning, he and Tsai, masked and armed
with knives and guns, apprehended Hsieh at his clinic. They beat the
doctor, who attempted to resist, before bundling him into a waiting
car driven by the third suspect, Chiu Sheng-lung.</P>
      <P>They made several phone calls to Hsieh's family between Tuesday
afternoon and early Wednesday morning, demanding a ransom of NT$30
million in exchange for the doctor's release. The amount was
eventually reduced to NT$5 million after bargaining but in fact by
that time, Hsieh had already been shot to death and his body burned.</P>
      <P>Chen said they took Hsieh to a remote mountainous area in
Kaohsiung County, where, despite their strong objections, Tsai shot
the doctor in the left temple and set the body aflame. According to
Chen, Tsai even told them: "It's no big deal to kill a person."</P>
      <P>Chen told the police that regretted getting involved in the
kidnap, stressing that he didn't know that Tsai intended to kill the
doctor.</P>
      <P>The other five suspects were arrested on charges of helping the
assailants rent the car used in the kidnapping and assisting them in
making their getaway.</P>
      <P>The kidnappers fates were sealed when one of Hsieh's nurses
caught a glimpse of the license plate of the rental car as it Made
off with Hsieh inside. Although the plate had been tampered with, the
police were able to locate the store that owns the rented car, and
from there were able to identify the suspects.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,    Feb.   27   (CNA)
(By Lin Wen-fen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Jaw Shau-kong, a heavyweight
with the opposition New Party, on Friday proposed his own unique
version of a cross-strait policy, the goal of which he termed as:
"Make a fortune together and discuss reunification some other time."</P>
      <P>Jaw, a founding member of the pro-reunification New Party, said
that Taiwan and mainland China can establish "constructive strategic
partnership," similar to the one between the United States and
mainland China.</P>
      <P>In a press conference which will be held for three consecutive
days in order for Jaw to express his thoughts on national issues, he
said that only through increasing contacts and exchanges of the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait will Taiwan have the chance to export
democracy to the mainland.</P>
      <P>To show goodwill to Beijing as part of efforts to improve
cross-strait relations, Jaw suggested that the government of the
Republic of China announce that it will stick to its "one China"
policy, that it won't seek Taiwan independence, and that it won't
seek membership in the United Nations.</P>
      <P>While saying that a "one China, two countries" scheme which was
proposed a few days ago by some New Party members runs counter to the
party's official mainland policy, Jaw said that this doesn't mean
that the party members cannot have other opinions on mainland policy.
The most important question after a new mainland policy is approved
by the party will be whether the New Party followers will support the
policy, he added.</P>
      <P>After his failure in a bid to win the Taipei mayoral election
three years ago, Jaw has gradually withdrawn from the political arena
and currently runs a local radio station.</P>
      <P>Asked if the holding of the press conference means that he
intends to return to political arena, Jaw replied that the answer
will be known within the next two days.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GAP BETWEEN TAIWAN, BRITISH TRADE OFFICIALS NARROWED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>London,  Feb. 27 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Although Taiwan and British officials have
not resolved all their differences, Republic of China Vice Economic
Affairs Minister Lin Yi-fu said here on Friday that both sides have
greatly narrowed the gap between their positions during their latest
round of annual trade talks.</P>
      <P>Lin, who arrived in London on Wednesday at the head of an ROC
government mission to take part in a Taiwan-Britain bilateral
economic and trade consultation, told the CNA that Taiwan's monopoly
tax on whisky imports from Britain remains a thorny issue which needs
to be tackled further.</P>
      <P>Britain has expressed full support for Taiwan's bid to join the
WTO, and is very interested in forging agreements on intellectual
property rights protection and double-tax exemption with Taiwan, Lin
noted.</P>
      <P>During the one-and-a-half-day meeting, the two sides also
discussed ways to accelerate commercial and investment exchanges
between the two countries, and the opening of international and
regional trade organizations, commodity and service markets.</P>
      <P>Lin said he fully understands Britain's concern over Taiwan's
disproportionately high monopoly tax on Scotch whisky compared to
similar products from other regions, and promised to convey this
concern to the relevant ROC government agencies so that it can be
resolved as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Under Taiwan's tobacco and alcohol monopoly system, which
basically imposes liquor and wine taxes based on the products'
prices, a tax of NT$440 (US$13.4) per liter is levied on whisky from
Scotland and Ireland, while the rate for whiskey from other regions
is set at NT$198 (US$6).</P>
      <P>The Scotch Whisky Association called the taxation discriminatory,
and said it is responsible for the decreased market share of European
liquors in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Scotch whisky accounted for 38.49 percent of total liquor imports
in Taiwan in the first 10 months of last year, down from 44.64
percent in 1996, while the market share of Japanese whiskey rose from
6.78 percent to 22.21 percent over the same period, according to
Taiwan customs sources.</P>
      <P>Britain has been so successful at marketing Scotch whisky in
Taiwan during the last several years that it is now the
second-largest British export item to the island.</P>
      <P>Britain is currently Taiwan's third-largest trading partner in
Europe. Two-way trade between the two countries reached US$4.6
billion in 1997.</P>
      <P>Before arriving in London, Lin and his party visited Israel and
the northern African country of Tunisia.</P>
      <P>In Israel, the officials were warmly received by their official
counterparts, and the two sides exchanged views on cooperation in the
aerospace industry, and the biological technology and electronics
sectors, paving the way for the signing of agreements on bilateral
cooperation in the near future, according to Lin.</P>
      <P>Following his Tunisian visit, Lin concluded that the country's
textile industry may be an excellent choice for Taiwan investors,
given that the market can serve as a quota-free gateway to the
European Union and the United States.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC TRADE MISSION TO VISIT FOUR EAST EUROPEAN COUNTRIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  28  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China Board of Foreign
Trade (BOFT) said on Saturday that it will organize a trade mission
to explore emerging markets in central and eastern Europe.</P>
      <P>The delegation of trade officials and business executives is
scheduled to visit Lithuania, Latvia, Finland and Russia between May
23 and June 11 to seek trade and investment opportunities and promote
bilateral economic cooperation, BOFT officials said.</P>
      <P>In addition to meeting with trade and economics officials of the
four countries, the delegation will sponsor trade forums in their
major cities, tour industrial parks and export processing zones, and
visit major trade promotion organizations.</P>
      <P>According to BOFT tallies, Taiwan's aggregate trade with central
and eastern European countries amounted to US$910 million in 1997,
accounting for a mere 2.3 percent of its total trade with Europe as a
whole.</P>
      <P>Of this amount, Taiwan exports to those countries comprised
US$530 million, up 15.3 percent from the year-earlier level.</P>
      <P>BOFT officials said there is still ample room for trade with
central and eastern European countries. Many nations in the region,
such as Russia, Latvia and Lithuania, have been undertaking extensive
market reforms and are enjoying brisk economic growth.</P>
      <P>Noting that trade with Russia has grown rapidly in recent years,
the officials said Russia is eager to buy computer peripherals,
textiles and consumer electronics.</P>
      <P>The officials further said Latvia and Lithuania have been
actively pushing for economic reforms since they declared
independence in the early 1990s. The officials suggested that local
manufacturers set up production facilities in the two countries to
facilitate their forays into the region.</P>
      <P>Finland shares a common border with Russia and is a member of the
European Union. "Given its special geographic location, Finland can
act as a bridgehead to explore emerging markets in the region," said
a BOFT official.</P>
      <P>Because of the geographic distances involved, and the special
trade practices in the region, the official said local traders had
better pool their resources in tapping those emerging markets.
"Previous experience has shown that joint efforts are far more
effective than individual promotional activities in making inroads
into eastern European markets," he added.</P>

      <P>Government employees including teachers in
central Taiwan's Nantou County, felt relieved on Friday when they
heard that they will receive their pay checks for March and for the
rest of this year, thanks to assistance from the provincial and
central governments.</P>
      <P>Premier Vincent Siew on Friday said that he has instructed the
provincial government to subsidize NT$240 million to make up the
shortfall of the March payroll for local government employees in
Nantou County.</P>
      <P>Siew also said that the Taiwan Bank will provide a NT$1.5 billion
loan to the agricultural county to help relieve the financial plight
the Nantou county government is facing in meeting payments to its
employees.</P>
      <P>Peng Pai-shien, who took over leadership of the county in late
December following the opposition Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP)'s victory in November elections, announced on Thursday that as
the county coffers are fast approaching empty, he had decided that
pay for nearly 8,000 public servants in the county would be
suspended.</P>
      <P>Peng said that as of the end of last year, the local government
deficit has accumulated to NT$2.2 billion, adding that if the
provincial or central governments failed to offer substantial
assistance, the suspension would continue indefinitely.</P>
      <P>However, Peng, a former DPP legislator, said that a NT$200
million educational subsidy might be used to pay part of the payroll,
which would mean that employees would still get half of their pay for
March.</P>
      <P>According to Peng, the annual disposable revenue of the Nantou
County government stands at just NT$2.1 billion approximately, but
payroll spending for local government employees costs NT$420 million
per month, a total of NT$5 billion per year.</P>
      <P>Peng's move was seen as part of efforts to draw the central
government's attention to the financial problems faced by the
cash-strapped county, and to win greater discretion over the disposal
of the revenue collected in the county. Under the current political
system, revenue collected in a county or city is allocated among the
central government, the provincial government and the local
government.</P>
      <P>In 1995, the total revenue collected in Nantou county stood at
NT$8.6 billion, of which only some NT$2 billion was at the disposal
of the county government. The annual expenditure listed in the
county's budget for that year, however, reached NT$12.1 billion,
meaning that even if the total revenue collected in the county had
been at the disposal of the local government, there would still have
been a shortfall in funds for development.</P>
      <P>Peng said he hopes that in addition to an overhaul of the revenue
allocation law, the central government will institute laws governing
subsidies to government employee payroll spending and to the welfare
policies of the nation's poorer counties and cities.</P>

    <HEADLINE>RESUMING TALKS TOPS ALL CROSS-STRAIT ISSUES: CHANG</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 28 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Resuming talks between the Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF) and the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Strait (ARATS), is the top priority of all efforts concerning
cross-strait relations, Chang King-yuh, chairman of the Mainland
Affairs Council (MAC), said on Saturday.</P>
      <P>Only by guiding the SEF-ARATS communication onto the right track
will a meeting between the heads of the two intermediary bodies
become possible, and talks on resolutions to other differences across
the Taiwan Strait be a natural progression, Chang noted.</P>
      <P>During a speech to a symposium hosted by National Chengchi
University, Chang expressed welcome to the latest ARATS response to
Taipei's calls for a resumption of cross-strait dialogue.</P>
      <P>Although differences exist and controversies take time to solve,
Chang said the common goal of seeking peaceful rapprochement across
the Taiwan Strait and the eventual unification of China remain
unchanged.</P>
      <P>He called for both sides to demonstrate sincerity in a rational
and practical manner during the testing process.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, at the same symposium, Chang Jung-kung, director of
the ruling Kuomintang's Department of Mainland Affairs, again urged
Beijing to face the fact that Taiwan and mainland China are two
distinct political entities existing on either side of the Taiwan
Strait.</P>
      <P>The best idea for both sides, or any other parties in the world,
to handle cross-Taiwan Strait relations, is to treat the issue from
the point of view of a divided nation, Chang noted.</P>
      <P>He also predicted that the second meeting between SEF Chairman
Koo Chen-fu and ARATS Chairman Wang Daohan will be held this year,
after a hiatus of five years since their last history-making and
ice-breaking rendezvous in Singapore in April 1993.</P>

    <HEADLINE>RESIDENTS NEAR CAL CRASH SITE DEMAND REDRESS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  28 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Residents near the site of the worst-ever
air crash in Taiwan's history on Saturday demanded that China
Airlines (CAL) shoulder the responsibility of dealing with the issue
of property damaged by the crash as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Several houses were destroyed or seriously damaged when a CAL
A300-600R airbus crashed on approach to the Chiang Kai Shek
International Airport Feb. 16, killing all 196 on board and six on
the ground.</P>
      <P>Over 100 protesters from 30 or 40 households, waving large
banners which said "homeland turning into graveyard," "ghosts crying
in the night," and "bodies strewn over the fields," gathered near the
crash site to protest against CAL for not handling compensation for
damage to their houses in a timely enough manner.</P>
      <P>They complained that after days of heavy rain, their damaged
houses have developed cracked walls and leaking roofs. They voiced
concern that their houses could collapse in the event of an
earthquake, a fairly common occurrence in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>CAL has evacuated residents from five houses that were completely
destroyed, and the occupants of four other houses that were severely
damaged, resettling them elsewhere.</P>
      <P>But residents who said their houses were also damaged by the
impact of the plane crash expressed hope that CAL will purchase their
houses and land so that they can move to other places soon.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, work to identify all the crash victims has been
continuing around the clock. The Taoyuan Prosecutors' Office has
issued 152 death certificates so far, but it will wait for CAL to
work out a solution with the families of the victims whose bodies
were burned beyond recognition.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC PREMIER CALLS FOR COMPASSION TO HEAL 2-28 SCARS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 28 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Vincent Siew on Saturday called for
compassion and tolerance to heal the wounds and divisions left by the
tragic February 28 Incident of 1947.</P>
      <P>Siew made the appeal during a memorial service marking the 51st
anniversary of the incident, which was sparked by the arrest and
beating of an elderly female street vendor selling untaxed
cigarettes. Subsequent islandwide rioting and anti-Kuomintang (KMT)
protests followed by a brutal military crackdown caused the death of
thousands of innocent people all over Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Noting that the tragic incident has touched many families here,
Siew said that Feb. 28 is a day of sadness, but added: "In recent
years, the government has shown it has the courage and sincerity to
face historical facts and has adopted many measures to heal the
wounds and scars left by the episode."</P>
      <P>In remembrance of those lost in the unrest and its aftermath,
Siew said he hopes the nation will learn a lesson from the tragic
events of the past to avoid the recurrence of similar tragedies in
the future.</P>
      <P>"Let us break from the pathos of the past, walk away from old
resentments and demonstrate our power to create a more harmonious,
brighter future," Siew urged.</P>
      <P>He further encouraged his fellow countrymen to pause for
reflection at this critical juncture in the nation's development. "We
can draw inspiration from the incident," Siew said. "Let us forgive
and forget."</P>
      <P>The premier also called for unity and social harmony, saying that
all Taiwan's residents, regardless of whether they moved from the
Chinese mainland centuries ago or after the ROC government moved its
seat to Taiwan from the mainland in 1949, should stand united and
work from the grassroots to cope with the numerous challenges and
tests that lie ahead in the completion of the country's many
construction and reform projects in preparation for the new
millennium.</P>
      <P>The memorial service at the 2-28 Peace Memorial Park in downtown
Taipei was jointly presided over by Taipei Mayor Chen Shui-bian and
Minister-without-Portfolio Chao Shou-po, who concurrently serves as
chairman of the 2-28 Memorial Foundation.</P>
      <P>Chao said the foundation has commissioned local academics to draw
up concrete measures to restore the reputations of many innocent
people who were convicted and executed in connection with the 2-28
Incident. The scholars are studying some foreign practices and will
come up with a comprehensive package of measures before the end of
June.</P>
      <P>"In memory of all the victims, we should transform sadness into
strength and work hand-in-hand to create a more just and harmonious
society with a sense of common destiny," Chao added.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, Mayor Chen said President Lee
Teng-hui has publicly apologized for the tragic incident on behalf of
the government. "This indicates that the government has the sincerity
to face its past mistakes. I hope the relevant government agencies
will hereafter handle various 2-28 Incident-related issues in a more
broadminded manner and make public all related historic archives and
documents."</P>
      <P>Professor Lin Chun-yi, whose father was executed without trial in
the incident, urged the families of all the 2-28 victims to forgive
and forget the historic wounds and dedicate themselves to pushing for
continued democratic reforms and cultural, economic and social
development in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>An inscription featuring 642 Chinese characters on a facet of
the globe-shaped sculpture, which forms part of the 2-28 Monument in
Taipei's 2-28 Peace Memorial Park was destroyed by unidentified
persons a few hours after it was unveiled on Feb. 28, 1997. Some
families of the victims were dissatisfied with the content of the
destroyed inscription.</P>
      <P>Lin said he hopes a new inscription featuring an accurate
account of the incident will be installed on the mounment in the near
future.</P>
      <P>Similar commemorative activities were also held in other major
cities around the island to mark the occasion.</P>

    <HEADLINE>COA TO UPGRADE INDIGENOUS PORK TO COUNTER ASSAULT OF FOREIGN PORK</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  28  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council of Agriculture (COA) said on
Saturday that it will upgrade the competitive edge of local pork to
counter the expected onslaught from foreign pork in Taiwan's market
after its accession into the World Trade Organization (WTO).</P>
      <P>Hog farmers have expressed serious concern that US pork will
undercut local pork prices in the Taiwan market since Taiwan last
week initialed an agreement with the US on the island's terms for WTO
entry, especially as Taiwan has promised to allow an immediate market
opening for 5,000 tons of currently-banned pork cuts and 7,500 tons
of pork variety meats from the US.</P>
      <P>To cope with the situation, COA is planning to cut the island's
hog population from the current 8.5 million head to 6 million in the
future.</P>
      <P>Chen Pao-ki, director of the COA's Animal Industry Department,
said that it is cheaper to produce pork and chicken in the US, which
gives the US an edge if it exports these products to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>But he also pointed out that Japan's market was not affected by
the entry of US pork after Tokyo joined the WTO, adding that Taiwan
pork still accounted for 50 percent of the Japanese market, up until
a ban imposed as a result of an epidemic of foot and mouth disease
which ravaged Taiwan in March last year. Chen described this as proof
that the taste of Taiwan pork is indeed better than that produced in
the US.</P>
      <P>To increase the competitive edge of Taiwan pork, Chen said that
the COA has mapped out a plan which will include the establishment of
a sperm bank for semen taken from top quality stud hogs, the use of
imported stock to develop a new generation of high-yield indigenous
pork with superior flavor, together with integrated management of hog
farms and the promotion of joint purchasing to lower the costs of hog
farming.</P>
      <P>Chen said that US pork cuts and bellies may lose some of their
flavor after long hours of transportation, and said they will be more
likely to be processed into pork products, instead of going directly
to the consumer market.</P>
      <P>The COA will also step up the quality control and inspection
systems for local pork, as well as promoting a sound distribution
system.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN OPPOSES APEC EARLY VOLUNTARY LIBERALIZATION PLAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  28 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan, along with Japan, South Korea and
mainland China, has recently expressed opposition to an APEC
initiative to voluntarily liberalize the fishing and fishery products
sector at an early date, in sharp contrast to the positions of some
other APEC nations, including Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the
United States.</P>
      <P>According to Huang Chin-jong, director of the Council of
Agriculture's Economics and Planning Department, who took part in an
APEC senior officials meeting in Penang, Malaysia in mid-February,
the representatives from Taiwan, Japan, South Korea and mainland
China are all opposed to an APEC initiative to include the fishing
and fishing products sector in the APEC Early Voluntary System of
Liberalization (EVSL).</P>
      <P>Taiwan's position is that by gradually lowering its import
tariffs on fishery products, the island is already contributing to
the APEC principle of upholding the spirit of free trade, Huang said.</P>
      <P>Like the officials from Japan, South Korea and mainland China,
the Taiwan representatives do not think adding the fishing and
fishery products sector to the EVSL is viable, he added.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has agreed to cut its tariff rates for imported fishery
products in line with its effort to become a member of the World
Trade Organization, Huang said.</P>
      <P>Senior officials from 18 APEC economies have discussed an accord
for EVSL in 15 sectors, nine of which have to be ready by next year.</P>
      <P>APEC trade ministers have only until this June to finalize
"detailed targets and timelines" for these nine fast-track sectors:
chemicals, energy, environmental goods and services, fish and fish
products, forest products, gems and jewelry, medical equipment,
telecommunications and toys.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The two-day Second Plenary Session of the
15th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC), which
concluded on Thursday, adopted a list of candidates for leading
positions in the government, including Hu Jintao for vice president
of mainland China, the Tokyo-based Yomiuri Shimbum reported from
Beijing on Saturday.</P>
      <P>Hu, 55, is currently a member of the Standing Committee of the
Politburo of the CPC Central Committee.</P>
      <P>The daily said that if its sources are correct and Hu has indeed
been recommended to become vice president, this would be a de facto
nomination for him to be the heir apparent to mainland Chinese
President Jiang Zemin.</P>
      <P>Whether the personnel reshuffle will be submitted to the Ninth
National People's Congress (NPC), slated to open March 5, is
attracting widespread attention, said the daily, adding that if it is
approved, this would be the first time for Beijing authorities to
accept a middle-aged politician for the post of vice president.</P>
      <P>The plenum deliberated and adopted a list of candidates for the
leading positions in government bodies to be submitted to the First
Session of the Ninth NPC, according to mainland China's official
Xinhua News Agency. The plenum also drew up another list of
candidates for the high-level posts in the National Committee of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), which
will be given to the First Session of the Ninth CPPCC National
Committee, Xinhua said.</P>
      <P>Incumbent mainland Chinese Vice President Rong Yiren, 81, is due
to retire because of his age. The plan to have him succeeded by Vice
Chairman of the 8th NPC Standing Committee Buhe (* editors note: one
name *) of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has been changed, the
Japanese daily said.</P>
      <P>The personnel reshuffle, observed the daily, is meant to
cultivate Hu, a member of the "fourth generation" of mainland China's
leadership, as Jiang's successor.</P>
      <P>Hu, a native of Shanghai and a graduate of Qinghua University,
has held the posts of CPC secretary for both Guizhou Province and the
Tibet Autonomous Region, according to the report. He was promoted to
the CPC Politburo at the 14th National Congress in 1992 and made a
member of the Standing Committee. Hu is seen as a crony of the late
CPC General Secretary Hu Yaobang and Song Ping, ex-head of the
Organization Department of the CPC, said the daily.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC VICE PRESIDENT ARRIVES IN BAHRAIN FOR VISIT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Bahrain,  Feb.  28  (CNA)
(By Yang I-feng and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Vice President Lien
Chan arrived in Bahrain from the Jordanian capital of Amman on
Friday evening for a private visit.</P>
      <P>Lien is the highest ROC official ever to visit the Persian Gulf
island state, which doesn't maintain formal diploamtic ties with
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lien's visit was seen a breakthrough in ROC-Bahrain relations as
the oil-rich emirate had many times rejected visa applications by
ministerial-level ROC officials in order to safeguard its friendly
ties with mainland China.</P>
      <P>Although Lien and his entourage managed to enter Bahrain
smoothly, 15 Taiwan reporters intending to cover Lien's Bahrain visit
were barred from entering the country. Bahrain would not offer them
landing visas. They were stranded at the airport.</P>
      <P>Su Chi, deputy secretary-general to the ROC President and a
member of Lien's entourage, has asked the ROC representative office
here to help Taiwan journalists resolve the visas issue.</P>
      <P>Lien dined with staff members of the ROC representative office
and Chinese communisty leaders here on Friday. During the dinner,
Lien expressed the government's concern for them.</P>
      <P>Lien is scheduled to tour major construction projects, including
a bridge linking Bahrain to Saudi Arabia, on Saturday. The vice
president will also meet with staff members of an ROC agricultural
mission stationed in Bahrain.</P>
      <P>Sources said Lien may meet with senior Bahrain officials during
his stay here.</P>
      <P>Bahrain is a major oil expertor in the Middle East and an
important base of the US Navy Fifth Fleet. Taiwan impots more than
US$100 million worth of crude oil from Bahrain annually. And annual
trade between the two countries exceeds US$150 million.</P>
      <P>Lien reportedly may travel to another Middle East country
following his Bahrain visit.</P>
      <P>Lien originally planned to journey to the war-torn Middle East
state of Lebanon after wining up a visit to Jordan. But he was forced
to cancel such a travel plan due to strong pressure from Beijing.</P>
      <P>Before coming to Bahrain, Lien concluded a four-day fruitful
visit to Jordan. Lien said he managed to meet with all Jordanian very
important persons (VIPs) he intends to meet. He also received a
honorary doctoral degree in social sciences from the University of
Jordan.</P>
      <P>Following his Middle East swing, previous press reports
said, Lien will make a stopover in Kuala Lumpur on his way home to
meet with top Malaysian leaders on feasible cooperative measures to
address the current Asian financial turmoil. Lien is expected to
return to Taipei on March 4.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NEW PARTY HEAVYWEIGHT WARNS PARTY TO SHORE UP ITS SUPPORT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  28  (CNA)
(By Lin Wen-fen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Jaw Shau-kong, a heavyweight with the
opposition New Party, on Saturday warned that if the party fails to
take effective steps to regain its popular support, it is destined to
suffer a serious setback in legislative election scheduled for the
end of the year.</P>
      <P>Jaw, one of the party's founding members, said that the New Party
has gradually lost its supporters, citing its rout in the last two
local elections. He expressed concern that without a plan to win back
supporters, the ambiguity of the New Party's official line will
further damage the pro-unification party's already-low popularity.</P>
      <P>Jaw was referring to the "one China, two countries" scheme that
several New Party members proposed a few days ago. The formula, which
concerns Taiwan's relations with mainland China, contradicts the
party's official mainland policy and has drawn severe criticism from
some party heavyweights and supporters.</P>
      <P>The Democratic Progressive Party, despite intraparty squabbling,
has never changed its goal of seeking "Taiwan independence," he
noted.</P>
      <P>Jaw made the remarks in his second press conference since Friday,
both of which were held for him to express his thoughts on national
issues and on the development of the New Party.</P>
      <P>The New Party should convene a national party congress as soon as
possible to help save the party from being abandoned by its
supporters, he said, stressing that the direction and development of
the party should be decided by all party members, not by a small
group at party headquarters.</P>
      <P>Jaw said that one issue that ought to be discussed at this
congress would be how New Party candidates should be nominated. He
suggested using primaries to determine the party's nominees.</P>
      <P>He warned that if the New Party cannot live up to the
expectations of its supporters, its target of garnering 15 percent of
the total vote in the year-end legislative election is impossible,
adding that he questions whether the party can secure even 5 percent
of the turnout if no improvements are made in the party.</P>
      <P>Jaw, who has gradually withdrawn from the political arena since
his failure to win the Taipei mayoral election some three years ago,
also said that Wang Chien-shien, acting secretary-general of the New
Party, should express a firm determination to run for the post of
Taipei mayor.</P>
      <P>Wang has said that he will seek the party's nomination to run in
the next Taipei mayoral election if Taiwan Governor James Soong or
former Minister Without Portfolio Ma Ying-jeou doesn't stand in that
race.</P>
      <P>Such insufficient determination is the reason Wang has failed to
win support in recent surveys, Jaw said. Wang has no reason to
hesitate since his political experience and moral character exceed
even those of Soong and Ma, he added.</P>
      <P>Jaw also said that incumbent Taipei Mayor Chen Shui-bian, who has
announced his determination to seek reelection, is already past his
peak popularity and can be defeated. The New Party, which received
the second most votes in the last Taipei mayoral election, has a good
chance to win the post of Taipei mayor this time, he stressed.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MONUMENT INAUGURATED AT FLASH POINT OF 2-28 INCIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  28  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A monument was inaugurated at the flash
point of the February 28 Incident of 1947 on Taipei's Nanking West
Road on Saturday to remind the nation to learn a lesson from the
incident to avoid the recurrence of similar tragedies in the future.</P>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Chen Shui-bian presided over the inaugural
ceremony, which proceeded amid solemn music in memory of all those
who lost lives in the tragic incident.</P>
      <P>Chen said the inscription on a monument erected by the central
government in Taipei's 2-28 Peace Memorial Park was destroyed by
unidentified disgruntled persons a few hours after it was unveiled on
Feb. 28 last year.</P>
      <P>"This was mainly because the inscription failed to give
an accurate, clear-cut account of the incident," Chen claimed,
adding that the destruction of the inscription also indicated that
the wounds and divisions left by the 2-28 incident have not yet been
completely heeled. "Many of our ordinary citizens want the government
to more honestly clarify its role or responsibility in the
incident."</P>
      <P>The outspoken mayor from the opposition Democratic Progressive
Party said to probe who should be held responsible for the incident
is by no means aimed at encouraging hatred or revenge. "Our main
purpose is to remind the people to learn a lesson from the past
tragedy. We believe only those who can honestly face history can
dedicate themselves to pursuing permanent peace."</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, Chen said the Taipei City Government has
decided to erect a monument at the site where the first shot in the
infamous incident was fired on Feb. 28, 1947. "By so doing, I hope
the history will not be forgetten, the historical wounds will
heal and the souls of the innocent dead will be comforted."</P>
      <P>The monument features Chinese and English inscriptions detailing
the background and start of the tragic incident, which resulted in
the death of thousands of innocent people and caused decades of
hatred and bitterness between native Taiwanese and mainland Chinese
immigrants.</P>
      <P>The 750-word Chinese inscription blamed Generalissimo Chiang
Kai-shek for ordering military crackdown which planted the roots of
ethnic division in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Kuomintang (KMT) troops were called in from the Chinese mainland
to quell the riots which erupted after government inspectors beat an
elderly woman selling untaxed cigarettes on Feb. 28, 1947. The
violence spread across the island and led to deep resentment of
mainland immigrants and the KMT government.</P>
      <P>Reference to the incident remained taboo until a few years ago.
Taiwan's democratization has enabled open discussion and research on
the tragedy, leading to an open apology from President Lee Teng-hui
three years ago.</P>

    <DATELINE>St.  George's, Grenada, Feb. 27 (CNA)
(By Eduardo Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Taiwan computer show will
open on Saturday in St. George's, capital of the Caribbean nation of
Grenada, as part of a science and technology exhibition during the
ninth inter-sessional meeting of the CARICOM Summit of heads of
government, scheduled to open in St. George's in early March.</P>
      <P>Organized by the Republic of China Embassy in St. George's, the
show will take place at the Grand Anse Trade Center from Feb. 28 to
March 3.</P>
      <P>ROC Ambassador to Grenada Lin Yung-loh expects that Taiwan will
gradually develop an increasing partnership with CARICOM members in
the field of science and technology.</P>
      <P>The show is being co-sponsored by Taiwan computer giant ACER, one
of the top ten brand names in the world computer industry. ACER will
present to the general public in Grenada the latest models of its
various computer and related peripheral equipment.</P>
      <P>According to the 1997 Yearbook of the Taiwan Semiconductor
Industry, Taiwan's production value of personal computers and related
hardware in 1996 totaled US$24.2 billion. Personal computers,
monitors, notebooks, and motherboards accounted for 80 percent of the
total.</P>
      <P>Many of Taiwan's personal computer products, such as scanners,
motherboards, mice, keyboards and monitors now rank top worldwide in
terms of global sales. Overall, Taiwan's information industry has
grown to the point where it now follows only those of the United
States and Japan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CANADA'S PARLIAMENT ALLOWS TABLING OF TAIWAN TIES REPORT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  Feb.  27  (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Canada's House of Commons gave unanimous
consent this week to the tabling of a parliamentary group's report on
bilateral relations between Canada and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>This is "the first time in memory" that the House has allowed the
tabling of a report from an unofficial parliamentary organization,
said Paul Szabo, chair of the Canada-Taiwan Parliamentary Friendship
Group.</P>
      <P>The group has a membership of 75 parliamentarians, an indication
that more and more Canadian MP's and their constituents are getting
interested in their country's relationship with the Republic of
China.</P>
      <P>The report was jointly adopted by Szabo and six other members who
visited Taiwan on Jan. 11-17. The Liberal MP from Toronto was pleased
his group "received all party support" on Wednesday to table the
report on cultural and trade issues.</P>
      <P>He noted: "Our organization provides an important opportunity for
all parliamentarians to promote bilateral initiatives which we feel
will benefit Canadian trade and relations with Taiwan."</P>
      <P>The nine-page report covers issues ranging from visa to cultural
exchanges, with recommendations for the House and the government to
work out measures that will help promote Canadian interests in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>It pointed out that last year, Canada issued more than 140,000
visas to ROC nationals and Canadian officials report "very few
problems" except a concern over document security. "PRC nationals
have used Taiwan documents to claim refugee status in Canada," it
said.</P>
      <P>In view of the high volume and track record between the two
countries, the MP's saw "a strong case" for waiving the visa
requirement if the refugee-claim issue can be addressed. "This is a
`pride issue' which would enhance bilateral relations," they
stressed.</P>
      <P>Taiwan officials based in Ottawa said Canadian immigration
authorities were inclined toward waiving visa requirement if Taipei
agrees to accept false claimants returned by the Canadian customs.
Negotiations are continuing in this regard.</P>
      <P>The Canadian report also suggested that Ottawa upgrade its
immigration services in Taipei to a "full service office" so that
Taiwan applicants do not have to fly to Singapore for interviews. It
noted that "this matter would not be considered a concern to the PRC"
and "the move would be seen as an important enhancement to the
economic and cultural relationship between our countries."</P>
      <P>On negotiations about signing a Double Taxation Arrangement
(DTA), which have been stalled because of protests from the Taiwanese
Canadian community, the report urged the resumption of talks.
Canadian business is at a competitive disadvantage without such an
arrangement, it claimed.</P>
      <P>Another reason Canada needs a DTA is that Taiwan is effectively
becoming a "science island" which offers many opportunities for
Canadian business. A DTA with Taiwan "will be an important element in
opening up those opportunities," according to the report.</P>
      <P>It further pointed to the R&amp;D opportunities in "genetic
engineering of farm animals and crops," an area Taiwan has extended
to after becoming a world leader in semiconductor and other high
technologies. Since Canada has high expertise in agriculture, it
should make "a full review" on how to identify and act on these key
opportunities, the report said.</P>
      <P>On cultural exchanges, the report urged the House to "ensure an
appropriate level of Canadian government support" for the True North
Festival, a private-sector initiative which will showcase Canadian
music and visual arts in Taiwan and mainland China in December 1998.</P>
      <P>It finally recommended a full assessment of the Canadian Trade
Office in Taipei (CTOC) facilities, which the visiting MP's found to
be "cramped and inadequate."</P>
      <P>Changes should be made at the CTOC to stimulate trade
opportunities, to provide the staff with a more productive
environment and "to signal to Taiwan the importance we place on our
relationship with them," the report said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>COPYRIGHT PIRACY COSTS US FIRMS US$10.8 BILLION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Geneva,  Feb.  27  (CNA)
(By Maurus Young)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Copyright piracy of music, books, movies
and computer software cost US industry an estimated US$10.8 billion
in 1997, according to reports from the Geneva-based World Trade
Organization (WTO) on Friday.</P>
      <P>The International Intellectual Property Alliance (IIPA) listed 55
countries and recommended to US Trade Representative Charlene
Barshefsky that Greece and Bulgaria should be designated as Priority
Foreign Countries unless significant improvements in enforcement are
made by April 30, the WTO report said.</P>
      <P>US pressure has already prodded mainland China into clamping down
on pirate CD factories.</P>
      <P>"We are now asking Ambassador Barshefsky to take on the largest
exporter of pirate CD products in Europe -- Bulgaria -- and to
continue to press the largest exporter of pirate products in Latin
American -- Paraguay -- to do the same as China," IIPA president Eric
Smith was quoted by the WTO report as saying.</P>
      <P>"Greece has also failed to take the necessary enforcement actions
to halt blatant and ongoing TV piracy at a level unprecedented in
Western Europe."</P>
      <P>"Both European countries show a lack of political will to crack
down," Smith was quoted as saying.</P>
      <P>In Paraguay, which the group alleged is a major production and
transport center for pirated and counterfeited copyright products,
the IIPA said the problem has grown out of control and is damaging
markets for legitimate products throughout Latin America.</P>
      <P>The IIPA recommended that 19 new countries be added to the
"Priority Watch List," subjecting them to increased scrutiny from US
authorities.</P>
      <P>The IIPA is a coalition of industry groups representing over
1,350 US companies producing and distributing products around the

    <HEADLINE>NEW BLOOD TEST SEEN REVOLUTIONIZING PRENATAL TESTING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Feb.  28  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A newly developed blood test could
revolutionize prenatal testing by allowing prospective parents to
screen their unborn baby for genetic diseases at six weeks'
gestation, if the method succeeds in clinical trials later this year.</P>
      <P>The mass circulation newspaper The Australian reported Saturday
that PreScreen, developed jointly by Flinders Technologies in
Adelaide and BMC in the United States, is designed to detect defects
four to 10 weeks earlier than present methods -- and without the risk
of causing a spontaneous abortion.</P>
      <P>John Turner, managing director of Flinders University's
commercial development arm, told the daily that while the test is not
yet perfect, it is already about 80 percent accurate, with trials in
Australia and overseas expected to lift that above 90 percent.</P>
      <P>He said the test will be an enormous international money spinner
as more parents take the opportunity to reduce the risk of abnormal
offspring.</P>
      <P>He said PreScreen could be on the market as early as next year
and is able to detect Down's Syndrome, cystic fibrosis, diabetes and
Huntington's disease, as well as the blood conditions thalessemia and
hemophilia.</P>
      <P>He said one likely impact of the test if it succeeds -- and some
experts remain skeptical -- will be an increase in the termination of
fetuses in planned pregnancies.</P>
      <P>But Turner said early detection would also allow doctors to
correct some conditions while the fetus is in the womb and its low
immune system does not reject certain treatments.</P>
      <P>He said the test is able to extract fetal cells from a mother's
blood using special antibodies that only lock into fetal material.</P>
      <P>The antibodies have charged particles attached, allowing the
fetal cells to be separated from a mother's cells by a magnet. Once
isolated, colored stains indicating a genetic fault could be applied.
But Turner said that in the early stages of the test's development,
the result would still need confirmation by existing tests.</P>
      <P>These tests access fetal cells -- with their genetic information
-- through a syringe inserted into a mother's abdomen.</P>
      <P>This can be done at 10 weeks with chorlonic villus sampling and
at about 16 weeks with amniocentesis. Both carry a small risk of
aborting the fetus, he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AUSTRALIA DEVELOPING NEW RESCUE PACKAGE FOR INDONESIA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Feb.  28  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia is developing a new rescue
package to help Indonesia reorder its massive private banking debts
and stabilize the hopelessly devalued rupiah so that Jakarta will be
able to quell food riots and social disorder.</P>
      <P>The rescue package will be similar to the international
assistance to South Korea and will involve Australia and other
countries providing coordination and organizational support to the
scores of private banks that have financed Indonesia's economic
development projects.</P>
      <P>Australian Prime Minister John Howard said Australia's role will
not involve any extension of the existing financial aid to Indonesia
through the International Monetary Fund (IMF).</P>
      <P>He said a combination of the IMF's economic reform demands, local
food shortages because of drought, international reluctance to invest
in Indonesia and the huge devaluation of the rupiah have pushed food
prices out of the reach of ordinary Indonesians, sparking rioting in
many places in the world's biggest Islamic country.</P>
      <P>Howard said Australia is deeply concerned about social disruption
in Indonesia and that the latest proposal is the third step aimed at
providing assistance in addition to the IMF's economic rescue
package.</P>
      <P>He did not give details, however, of the new rescue package,
saying only: "One of the ways in which you can ameliorate the social
strain is to have a bit of stabilization in the exchange rate.</P>
      <P>"It's the dramatic fall in the value of the rupiah which is one
of the things feeding into the current crisis. Restoring
international confidence in relation to both the economic and
political decision-making process in Indonesia is one of the ways in
which you will stabilize the exchange rate.</P>
      <P>"We are conscious of how important Indonesia is, not only to us,
but also to the whole region," he said.</P>
      <P>Australia has already agreed to provide food aid and
organizational assistance to Indonesia on a bilateral basis and has
succeeded in convincing the IMF that it should soften the impact of
its austerity measures.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TWRA LOWERS SECOND QUARTER SURCHARGES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Los  Angeles,  Feb.  27  (CNA)
(By Philip Liu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Lower marine fuel prices and the
dramatic weakening of Asian currencies against the US dollar have
prompted the Transpacific Westbound Rate Agreement (TWRA) to lower
its fuel adjustment factor (FAF) and currency adjustment factor (CAF)
surcharges, effective for the calendar quarter beginning April 1.</P>
      <P>TWRA said it will reduce its FAF from US$120 to US$80 per 40-foot
and 45-foot container, from US$96 to US$64 per 20-foot container,
from US$60 to US$40 per vehicle for automobiles, from US$12 to US$8
per 1,000 board feet for lumber and from US$6 to US$4 per revenue ton
for cargo otherwise rated.</P>
      <P>At the same time, TWRA will lower its CAF on shipments to Taiwan
from 8 percent to 4 percent. The CAF on cargo to Japan will fall from
39 percent to 35 percent, while the CAF for Singapore will be lowered
from 13 percent to 9 percent. The CAF for South Korea, which was
reduced to zero last year, will remain suspended in the coming
quarter.</P>
      <P>CAFs are special surcharges, broken out from freight rates, that
are designed to fluctuate with exchange rates and help offset high
local currency costs in Asia that are outside carriers' control.
Similarly, FAFs fluctuate with world prices of marine fuel at key
transpacific loading points. They are designed to help offset
extraordinary fuel expenses that make up a large share of total
voyage costs.</P>
      <P>TWRA is a rate-making group of nine ocean and intermodal carriers
serving the trade from port and inland points in the United States to
destinations throughout Asia and the Indian Subcontinent.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ECONOMIC CRUNCH MAY CUT S'PORE BUDGET SURPLUS IN HALF</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  Feb.  28  (CNA)
(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Singapore government's budget for
the next fiscal year, which was unveiled in Parliament Friday, shows
that excess income over spending for the financial year starting
April 1 will leave a bottom line surplus of S$7.27 billion (US$4.38
billion) in the government's coffers.</P>
      <P>This compares to a surplus for the year ending March 31 this year
of S$14.33 billion -- up considerably from the S$12.62 billion
surplus projected last July, when the 1997-98 budget was presented,
The Straits Times reported Saturday.</P>
      <P>The 1998-99 fiscal year starts April 1, 1998 and ends on March
31, 1999.</P>
      <P>The Singapore Ministry of Finance said Friday that the low
forecast for the upcoming fiscal year "is consequent to the slowdown
in economic growth in the region."</P>
      <P>Some economists had speculated earlier in the week that the
government might target a balanced budget or even run a deficit for
the first time in 12 years due to fallout from the regional economic
turmoil.</P>
      <P>However, their fears were unsupported. In fact, although the
bottom line surplus is smaller than in previous years, the budget
includes a huge 25 percent jump in development expenditure on new
social and economic infrastructure projects.</P>
      <P>The bottom line surplus -- the excess of receipts over outlays --
is made up of budget surplus, net investment income and net capital
receipts minus net lending by the government.</P>
      <P>The budget surplus itself is what is left over from the operating
revenue after provisions for operating and development expenditure
and contributions, if any, for Edusave and Medical endowment funds
and pre-Medisave top-up and Medisave top-up schemes, the report said.</P>
      <P>This surplus for the 1998 financial year is projected at S$2.68
billion, down from 1997's revised figure of S$4.2 billion.</P>
      <P>The big jump in this year's revised surplus figure is largely due
to healthy economic growth last year despite the economic woes.</P>
      <P>Figures released by the Singapore Ministry of Trade and Industry
earlier this week showed that Singapore's economy expanded by a
robust 7.8 percent last year, compared to the 6.9 percent growth
recorded in 1996.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the government's operating revenue is estimated will
grow by a modest 3.8 percent to S$29.95 billion in the 1998-99 fiscal
year, over the revised S$28.84 billion figure for 1997-98.</P>
      <P>Overall, tax collection is expected to increase by S$554 million,
or 2.5 percent, to S$23.15 billion, mainly because income tax is
estimated to increase by S$480 million to S$10.38 billion.</P>
      <P>However, revenue from stamp duty is expected to drop by S$350
million to S$1.3 billion. This would largely be due to the slower
property market, which has seen a significant drop in sales of homes,
and the fall in stock market trading volumes, the report said.</P>
      <P>On the spending side, total expenditure in the 1998-1999
financial year is estimated at S$27.22 billion, a jump of 15 percent
over the previous year. Of this, operating expenditure accounts for
60 percent and development expenditure for 40 percent.</P>
      <P>As in previous years, the biggest slice of the pie goes to three
sectors: social and community services (37 percent), security (34
percent) and economic and infrastructure development (21 percent).
The remainder goes for general services.</P>
      <P>The Finance Ministry said the government's operating expenditure
for running expenses is projected to go up by S$1.12 billion, showing
an increase of 7.8 percent, to S$15.47 billion.</P>
      <P>But perhaps the most significant aspect of the new budget is the
increase in development expenditure, which is projected to rise by
S$2.34 billion to hit S$11.75 billion.</P>
      <P>Provisions for social and economic infrastructure projects,
including capital subsidies for public housing and research and
development funding, take up about 80 percent of development
expenditure.</P>

    <HEADLINE>S'PORE IMPOSES TOUGHER PENALTIES ON PORN FILMS, VIDEOS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  Feb. 28 (CNA)
(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Singapore has imposed tougher penalties
on the making and distribution of obscene films and videos, under
amendments to the Films Act passed in Parliament Friday.</P>
      <P>The amended law also bans the distribution and exhibition of
party political films, with a fine of up to S$100,000 (US$60,240).</P>
      <P>The definition of "film" has also been widened to include
CD-ROMs, VCDs, DVDs and computer files with moving images similar to
those found in a movie or video. Films sent via e-mail now come under
this definition.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the second reading of the bill, Singapore Information
and the Arts Minister Yeo Yong Mong said the amendments were in
response to technological advances. They were also prompted by the
fact that current penalties against obscene films seemed to be
insufficient deterrents, he added.</P>
      <P>He said in line with a "practical approach" policy, his ministry
had decided to take a step-by-step approach, amending the relevant
acts one by one instead of going for an omnibus legislation covering
the entire media field. This was because technology is still
unfolding and not all problems could be foreseen, he said.</P>
      <P>The changes in penalties:</P>
      <P>-- For selling obscene films: the fine has increased from S$1,000
per film to S$2,000, with the maximum doubled to S$80,000.</P>
      <P>-- For possession: the fine has doubled from S$500 to S$1,000 per
film, up to a maximum of S$40,000.</P>
      <P>-- For exhibiting these films: the penalty has been raised by a
hefty 10 times, to S$10,000, regardless of the number of films.</P>
      <P>-- For bringing them in through Customs check-points: a minimum
fine of S$1,000 per film and/or a jail term of up to one year.</P>
      <P>-- For duplicating obscene films: a lump sum fine of between
S$20,000 and S$40,000, and/or a jail term of up to two years.</P>
      <P>-- There will also be additional penalties for those who use
children to make, import or distribute obscene films.</P>
