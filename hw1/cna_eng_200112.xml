imitate the unmagnanimous. Imitating the unmagnanimous cannot be
taken as following the right standard."</TEXT>

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Although Saturday's legislative and local
elections were going smoothly nationwide, some small, sporadic
electoral incidents occurred in some polling stations.</P>
      <P>A young woman surnamed Yang in the southern port city of
Kaohsiung tore up her ballot sheet in a fit of petulance after she
was accused of making too much noise in the polling station.</P>
      <P>She was brought to a nearby police station for questioning and is
likely to face a fine ranging from NT$5,000 to NT$50,000 for
violating the Public Officials Election and Recall Law, according to
Kaohsiung election officials.</P>
      <P>A male voter in Taipei's Chungshan district tore up his ballot
sheet after he found he had mistakenly used his personal chop rather
than the designated polling chop.</P>
      <P>He was also questioned by police for violating the election and
recall law and was facing a fine.</P>
      <P>A similar incident occurred in the central city of Changhua,
while in the eastern city of Hualien, law enforcement authorities
were undecided on what to do after a man reportedly cast two ballots
instead of one.</P>
      <P>According to polling station officials, they were too late to
stop him casting the second ballot and were puzzled as to how the man
had two ballot sheets instead of one.</P>
      <P>Polling was taking place in 13,511 polling stations set up around
Taiwan and on the offshore counties of Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu for
the election of legislators, city mayors and county magistrates
during an eight-hour period between 8 a.m. and 4 p.m.</P>
      <P>In the hotly contested legislative elections, 455 hopefuls were
competing for 176 seats up for grabs, giving each candidate, 140 of
whom are seeking re-election, a 38.68 percent chance.</P>
      <P>In the elections for mayors and county chiefs, 88 candidates were
battling for 23 seats up for grabs islandwide in an even more severe
competition with an election rate of 26 percent.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CEC URGES VOTERS TO POLLING STATIONS IN FACE OF POOR INITIAL TURNOUT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 1 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Polling at more than 13,000 polling stations
nationwide for legislative and local elections was lukewarm as of
noon Saturday, prompting the Central Election Commission (CEC) to
urge voters to get out and vote.</P>
      <P>CEC authorities urged them to take advantage of the election to
choose "ideal and capable" lawmakers and public officials to serve
the people and the country.</P>
      <P>Despite the poor turnout in the morning, CEC officials were
confident that the total voting rate nationwide would reach at least
72 percent by 4 p.m. when polling ends.</P>
      <P>The officials said they expected vote counting at the 13,511
polling stations set up around Taiwan and on the offshore counties of
Penghu, Kinman and Matsu to conclude before 9:30 p.m. at the latest
and that the election results would be released almost
simultaneously, thanks to the computerized tallying system.</P>
      <P>Some 15.82 million voters were eligible to cast their votes to
directly elect 176 legislators from among 584 candidates, 140 of whom
were seeking re-election -- an election rate of 38.68 percent.</P>
      <P>Of the 584 legislative candidates, 434 hopefuls were competing
for 168 seats up for grabs in various constituencies, while 21
aboriginal candidates were vying for eight seats reserved exclusively
for aborigines.</P>
      <P>In the elections for mayors and county chiefs, 88 candidates were
battling for 23 seats up for grabs nationwide in an even more severe
competition, with an election rate of 26 percent. Some 12.835 million
voters were eligible to vote in these elections.</P>

    <HEADLINE>VOTING ENDS IN TAIWAN'S LEGISLATIVE, LOCAL ELECTIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  1 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Voting in Taiwan's hard-fought legislative
and local government chief elections ended at 4 p.m. Saturday, with
initial results expected to come out within the hour.</P>
      <P>A record 584 candidates were contesting 225 legislative seats
while 88 hopefuls vied for five mayoral and 18 county magistrate
posts. Competition was extremely fierce.</P>
      <P>The elections came 18 months after the island's first-ever
peaceful transition of power between different political parties and
the poll results are expected to shake up Taiwan's political
landscape if the former ruling and now opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
loses its absolute majority in the new legislature as is widely
anticipated.</P>
      <P>None of the parties were expected to emerge from the legislative
elections with an absolute majority, but the KMT still had a good
chance of winning the largest number of seats in the new legislature.</P>
      <P>On the eve of the polls, the KMT predicted it would win 90
parliamentary seats, down from the 110 it held prior to the voting.
The ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which controls barely
one-third of the seats at present, was expecting to win at least 85
seats.</P>
      <P>Voting proceeded smoothly overall, with only minor isolated
incidents reported in a few constituencies.</P>
      <P>The number of eligible voters in the legislative elections
reached more than 15.82 million, while the number of eligible voters
in the local-level elections exceeded 12.83 million. Voter turnout
was not expected to be as high as in last year's presidential
elections, which was between 77 percent and 78 percent.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER TO LEAD CABINET RESIGNATION AFTER NEW LEGISLATURE FORMS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  Dec.  1 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung said Saturday
that he will lead the Cabinet in an en masse resignation before the
new legislature opens its inaugural session Feb. 1, 2002 as
stipulated in the Republic of China Constitution.</P>
      <P>Chang made the statement in the southern port city of Kaohsiung,
where he cast his votes for the elections of legislators and local
government chiefs.</P>
      <P>Quoting former Democratic Progressive Party Chairman Huang
Hsin-chieh, who once said that elections are a happy occasion worthy
of celebration, Chang urged the nation's eligible voters to choose
the right candidates.</P>
      <P>He also called for the candidates to compete "like gentlemen" and
to accept the election results that represent the decision of the
voters.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, both Chang and President Chen Shui-bian
attended a ceremony to open the 2001 Taiwan Information Technology
Month in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Addressing the opening ceremony, Chen said elections are
transient and temporary, but the progress of national development,
including the evolution of the information technology industry, is
"forever and fundamental."</P>
      <P>Chang, who also spoke at the ceremony, said that the conclusion
of Saturday's elections "would also signal the end of all
mudslinging and off-message days" and he called for all concerned to
accept the voters' decision.</P>
      <P>He urged the people of Taiwan to "replace confrontation with
cooperation" and strive with the "Taiwan spirit" to enable the
country to surpass its challenges and difficulties.</P>
      <P>He added that the administration will try even harder in the face
of the recession, but noted that the administration has made
"noticeable achievements" over the past one-and-a-half years,
including enabling the 91.6 percent completion of the country's
public construction projects and initiating sweeping financial
reforms.</P>
      <P>On the development of cross-Taiwan Strait relations, Chang noted
that Taiwan has decided to open its tourism market to mainland
Chinese visitors and has lifted a ban on 122 computer
hardware-related industries relocating their manufacturing operations
to the Chinese mainland, in the hope that the long-imposed "no haste,
be patient" policy will be replaced by a more open, pragmatic
approach.</P>
      <P>Chang continued that soon after Taiwan becomes a formal member of
the World Trade Organization (WTO) early next year, it will have to
open its markets -- worth between US$6 billion and US$8 billion -- to
foreign companies, while other WTO members are expected to open their
markets -- with a total value of about US$200 billion -- to Taiwan
companies.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) accused the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) of libel Saturday for
describing the KMT in a newspaper ad that day as a "blue monster that
gobbles up votes today and will gobble up banknotes tomorrow."</P>
      <P>The KMT filed a lawsuit against the DPP at the Taipei
Prosecutors' Office and charged that the DPP also violated the Public
Officials Election and Recall Law by carrying out campaign activities
on election day.</P>
      <P>In response, DPP Secretary-General Wu Nai-jen said that it is up
to the Central Election Commission (CEC) to decide whether or not the
ad was a campaign activity.</P>
      <P>CEC Chairman Huang Shih-cheng said that the ad did indeed violate
the election law, but that the CEC is powerless to mete out
punishment in the form of a fine because the law only allows the
imposition of such fines if the violating party continues its illegal
action in spite of a CEC warning.</P>
      <P>Huang added that a draft amendment bill currently awaiting
ratification in the Legislative Yuan will plug the legal loophole and
raise the maximum allowable fine for such violations from the current
NT$100,000 (US$2,900) to NT$5 million (US$145,000).</P>

      <P>Taipei County Magistrate Su Tsen-chang
announced at around 7 p.m. Saturday success in his bid to win a
second term in office after taking a moderate lead over his closest
rival.</P>
      <P>Su, a standard-bearer of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party

opposition alliance of the Kuomintang (KMT), the People First Party

      <P>By the time he made his victory announcement, Su had garnered
slightly more than half of the ballots cast in the hard-fought race
in what is, demographically speaking, the island's largest county.</P>
      <P>Su said his win marks recognition of his administrative
credentials over the past four years and he expressed deep gratitude
for the voter support.</P>
      <P>Wang, a founder of the tiny NP, said that despite his defeat, he
appreciated the voter support as well as the enormous assistance
extended to him by the two other opposition parties.</P>
      <P>"The election has set a model for the integration of the KMT and
its two splinter groups," Wang said.</P>
      <P>The heated one-on-one duel had been widely seen as a test of
strength between the DPP and the opposition alliance. Some analysts
also said it gave the electorate a foretaste of the next presidential
election in 2004, in which President Chen Shui-bian is certain to be
pitted against a tripartite standard bearer.</P>

      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) performed better than expected in Taiwan's two largest cities
-- Taipei and Kaohsiung -- in Saturday's legislative elections.</P>
      <P>On the eve of the polls, DPP Chairman Frank Hsieh said the party
had to win at least 13 seats in the metropolitan Taipei and Kaohsiung
constituencies if it wants to emerge as the largest party in the new
Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>In the event, the party won a total of 14 legislative seats in
the two constituencies, with all six candidates fielded by the party
in the southern port city of Kaohsiung managing to win.</P>
      <P>In Taipei, the DPP fielded a total of 10 candidates for the
city's two precincts, eight of whom emerged victorious.</P>
      <P>Also in Taipei, the opposition People First Party (PFP) won six
of the 20 legislative seats up for grabs.</P>
      <P>The opposition Kuomintang (KMT), which ruled the island for 55
years prior to the 2000 presidential election, captured only four
parliamentary seats in Taipei. Although the party lost the presidency
last year, it still controls a majority in the current legislature.</P>
      <P>None of the tiny opposition New Party candidates managed to win
in the hard-fought Taipei and Kaohsiung races.</P>
      <P>In contrast, the newly formed Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU)
managed won a seat in Taipei, with the city's remaining legislative
seat going to independent candidate Sisy Chen, a former DPP
spokeswoman.</P>
      <P>The TSU, with former President Lee Teng-hui as its "spiritual

(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
credits its better-than-expected Taipei City results in Saturday's
legislative elections to its last-minute strategy of distributing its
supporters' votes among its candidates, according to a DPP official.</P>
      <P>The strategy -- designed to optimize the party's support base in
Taipei City -- entailed asking DPP followers to vote for a DPP
candidate according to the last number of their National
Identification Card.</P>
      <P>The party fielded 10 candidates in the two Taipei City
constituencies, so it designated two single-digit numbers for each
and asked voters to vote according to the last digit on their ID
cards, thereby ensuring that each candidate would get an equal number
of votes from DPP supporters.</P>
      <P>The plan succeeded in returning four lawmakers each in Taipei's
two constituencies in Saturday's elections.</P>
      <P>Even the two DPP losers -- one in each district -- were defeated
by only small margins, with one of them only 600 ballots shy of
winning a seat at the legislature.</P>
      <P>A DPP official in Shilin, a suburb of Taipei City, said his party
was both surprised and pleased with the results, because many DPP
rank-and-file members were skeptical of the vote distribution
strategy.</P>
      <P>However, the official went on, DPP supporters were spurred into
following the plan when a newspaper survey predicted that only four
of the 10 candidates would be elected.</P>
      <P>Lan Shih-chung, the sole DPP loser in Taipei's First Electoral
District was only 1,000 to 2,000 votes behind his closest rival and
Chou Po-ya, the sole DPP loser in the Second Electoral District was
just 600 votes short of winning.</P>

      <P>KMT Chairman Lien Chan said that the party will make a "thorough

      <P>Saturday's election saw the DPP attain the legislative majority
with 87 seats, followed by the KMT with 68 seats. The People First

just one seat.</P>
      <P>Until the election, the KMT held 115 seats in the Legislative

      <P>The DPP took control the presidency last year, but its first 17
months in power have been characterized by legislative gridlock and
bickering. Saturday's parliamentary electoral victory gives the DPP
the clout it needs to smooth its rule, Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>"We deeply appreciate the voter support and will redouble our
efforts to push for economic recovery and sweeping domestic reforms,"
he pledged.</P>
      <P>Hsieh further said the elections mark a victory for all the
people of Taiwan as the nation has taken yet another stride toward
becoming a mature democracy.</P>
      <P>According to Hsieh, the increase in the number of legislative
seats controlled by the DPP and the newly formed Taiwan Solidarity
Union's (TSU's) capture of 13 seats indicate that middle-of-the-road,
mainstream values have received widespread recognition.</P>
      <P>In the run-up to Saturday's polls, the DPP and the TSU, with
former President Lee Teng-hui as its "spiritual leader," were dubbed
the "pan green" alliance as they share similar ideals of stressing
Taiwan's separate identity and keeping mainland China at arm's
length.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said the electoral outcome also proves that the DPP's
efforts to move toward the middle-of-the-road from its original
pro-independence platform have been the right choice.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the tiny opposition New Party's failure to garner
the 5 percent of the vote it needed to qualify for proportional
representation legislative seats, Hsieh said the result indicates
that the party's support for the Beijing-proposed "one country, two
systems" scheme for the unification of the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait runs against the popular will of the people of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Hsieh also hailed the fact that several candidates with links to
organized crime lost their electoral bids. "This indicates that the
government's crackdown on vote-buying and `black gold' politics has
paid off and that Taiwan has made further progress in democratic
development," he noted.</P>
      <P>In future, Hsieh went on, Taiwan's party politics will be
characterized by competition among two large parties -- the DPP and
the Kuomintang, which won 68 seats in the latest polls -- and a
medium-sized party -- the People First Party, which garnered 46
seats.</P>
      <P>Turning to the local government chief elections that also took
place Saturday, Hsieh noted that the party captured only nine mayoral
and magistrate posts.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, he said, the DPP still managed to control the
administration of cities and counties in central and southern Taiwan,
with the exception of Yunlin County. "The population of the
DPP-controlled cities and counties account for 54 percent of the
total," he said, but he admitted that the party should step up its
efforts to increase its strength in the eastern part of the island.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIPEI MAYOR OPTIMISTIC ABOUT CONSOLIDATION OF POLITICAL PARTIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 2 (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou said Saturday that
the joint nomination of Wang Chien-shien by three parties as
candidate for Taipei county magistrate "proves the feasibility" of
consolidating the strength of the Kuomintang (KMT), the People First
Party (PFP) and the New Party (NP).</P>
      <P>Despite Wang's defeat to incumbent Taipei County Magistrate Su
Tseng-chang of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in Saturday's
election, it was significant that Wang was able to rally the efforts
of supporters of the three political parties, according to Ma.</P>
      <P>Ma stressed in particular the importance for the KMT and PFP to
cooperate in the future.</P>
      <P>While admitting that DPP's campaign tactics achieved good results
in the legislative election, Ma noted that KMT managed to take some
populous counties and cities away from the DPP in the local
elections.</P>
      <P>The KMT won nine of the 23 seats in the county and city
magistrate elections.</P>
      <P>KMT Chairman Lien Chan also spoke of the significance of the
KMT's winning several cities and counties currently under DPP rule

    <HEADLINE>DPP REPLACES KMT AS LARGEST PARTY IN LEGISLATURE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  1 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian has obtained what
he wanted of the parliamentary elections -- his Democratic
Progressives Party replacing the Kuomintang as the largest party in
the Legislative Yuan -- but whether that electoral victory can be
translated into swift government action to tackle daunting problems
facing Taiwan remains to be seen.</P>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) won 87 of the 225
seats in the unicameral legislature Saturday. The Kuomintang, the
largest party with 110 seats going into the elections, managed to get
only 68 candidates elected.</P>
      <P>With the help of the 13 Taiwan Solidary Union (TSU) freshmen
lawmakers, President Chen's DPP is ready to assume parliamentary
leadership, which the administration badly needs to end the
paralyzing grip the Kuomintang has on the outgoing legislature.</P>
      <P>The parliamentary leadership alone is not enough to get things
going for the Chen administration, according to a majority view of
political observers.</P>
      <P>There will be no parliamentary majority, observers said after the
results of the elections were published. The DPP will still confront
the opposition with nine independents controlling a majority of
legislative seats. The People First Party (PFP), the third largest in
the Legilative Yuan closely behind the Kuomintang with 46 seats, will
continue to oppose the DPP.</P>
      <P>Without that majority, the DPP is likely to be thwarted in much
of parliamentary legislation it has to enact to remedy the economic
and financial woes Taiwan has been suffering since President Chen
assumed office in May last year.</P>
      <P>Unemployment has hit a record high 5.33 percent. Gross domestic
product is expected to post an unprecedented negative growth for
2000. Financial institutions have been saddled with bad debts topping
NT$1 trillion. The terrorist attacks on the United States on Sept. 11
have dealt a crippling blow to the already ailing economy.</P>
      <P>The ruling party will continue to experience a parliamentary
stand-off, although much mitigated, unless it will be able to lure a
sufficient number of Kuomintang defectors and independents into its
fold.</P>
      <P>That is exactly what President Chen hopes to do by proposing a
"national stabilization alliance," which, however, has been rejected
by the Kuomintang and its splinter group, the PFP.</P>
      <P>The PFP was a clear victor in the heated parliamentary race. It
won the 46 legislative seats, plus two county magistrateships in
Taitung and on the offshore island of Matsu.</P>
      <P>James Soong, PFP chairman, was not elected to the Legislative
Yuan. He had ranked himself 11th on the PFP candidate list for
proportional representation, and narrowly lost because the party
failed to win two million votes or over 21 percent of the total cast.
Nontheless, he has boosted his chance of bearing the standard in the
2004 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Soong founded the PFP after he had lost last year's presidential
race.</P>
      <P>He spared no effort to campaign for PFP candidates, and for Wang
Chien-shien who, even with the support of the Kuomintang, and the New
Party, failed to beat incumbent DPP Magistrate Su Cheng-chang of
Taipei County.</P>
      <P>The Taipei county race was touted as a proving ground for the
next presidential election, in which President Chen is certain to be
pitted against a candidate with united opposition support like Wang,
who was not able to consolidate his tripartite alliance against Su.</P>
      <P>While suffering a near disaster in the legislative elections, the
Kuomintang could take comfort in adding two to the number of its
seven outgoing county magistrates and city mayors. It now occupies
nine such offices.</P>
      <P>Like the Kuomintang, the DPP collected nine local government
posts, including the one in Taipei County, while the tiny opposition
New Party won the magistrateship of Kinmen. Independents earned the
remaining two of the 23 offices at stake.</P>
      <P>The TSU, a new party former President Lee Teng-hui helped found
only three months before the elections, made an spectacle showing.
Its 13 candidates, all of them political new faces, rode in the
"coattail" of Lee, who, though not running himself, tirelessly
stumped for them.</P>
      <P>The biggest loser was the New Party. Reduced to only one seat, it
lost the right to elect any lawmaker in accordance with proportional
representation. END.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING POLITICAL OBSERVERS SURPRISED BY TAIWAN'S ELECTION RESULTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Beijing,  Dec.  1  (CNA)
(By Tzeng Chun-liang and Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Political observers in Beijing said
Saturday that they were surprised by the election results in Taiwan
whereby the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) replaced the
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) as the largest party in the Legislative
Yuan.</P>
      <P>Xu Bodong, director of the Taiwan Research Institute at Beijing
Union University, said that the DPP's victory can be attributed to
its successful ballot distribution strategy while it demonstrates
that its supporters' identification with the party is more stable.</P>
      <P>Xu predicted that Taiwan's political quagmire will continue after
the elections, and he believes that even if the independence-leaning
"pan-green" parties, which includes the DPP, had won an overall
majority, the "pan-blues" would have probably become even more united
after the elections to fight against the "pan-greens."</P>
      <P>Because the KMT lost the largest number of seats, Xu continued,
it remains to be seen whether the party will split again. He said
that the KMT is still the biggest variable affecting Taiwan's
political situation and that the key is whether a faction within the
party that favors native Taiwanese over those of mainland Chinese
descent will leave at the urging of former President Lee Teng-hui.</P>
      <P>A former KMT chairman who was expelled from the party in
September, Lee is the "spiritual leader" of the fledgling Taiwan
Solidarity Union, which is a member of the so-called "pan-green"
parties.</P>
      <P>Xu said that although a period of uneasy peace can still be
maintained in the Taiwan Strait as long as Chen does not publicly
announce Taiwan independence, bilateral relations remain unstable and
full of danger.</P>
      <P>Guo Zhenyuan, a senior fellow at the China Institute of
International Studies, a Beijing government think tank, said that the
DPP's surprising victory will not change Beijing's policy of
continuing to observe Chen, especially as some of the things he said
during the campaign have deepened Beijing's distrust toward him.</P>
      <P>Therefore, Guo predicted, it is difficult to see any concrete
development in cross-Taiwan Strait relations after the elections.</P>

      <P>Foreign trade and industry offices and
domestic industry leaders in Taiwan urged the newly elected
Legislative Yuan to focus on economic issues after Saturday's
legislative, county chief and mayoral elections.</P>
      <P>Noting that he has been in Taiwan for eight years and has
witnessed several elections, American Chamber of Commerce in Taipei
(AmCham) President Richard Henson urged Taiwan's political parties to
forgo their differences and concentrate on the economy instead of
continuing to "play the economy like politics."</P>
      <P>European Chamber of Commerce Taipei (ECCT) Chairman Fabrice de
Murat also urged the government to focus on the economy because
foreign businesses consider the local political situation this year
to have been "unstable."</P>
      <P>AmCham Executive Director Richard Vuylsteke said that Taiwan is
still politicking while mainland China is already devoting itself
fully to its economy. He added that foreign businessmen want to see
the "beef" in the government's policies, not campaign mudslinging.</P>
      <P>Henson said that as the power and influence of the Legislative
Yuan grows, Taiwan politicians should realize that partisan
cooperation is important, particularly in order to achieve consensus
on economic issues.</P>
      <P>He added that AmCham has begun to realize that foreign businesses

    <HEADLINE>ELECTION OUTCOMES WILL LEAD TO MORE POLITICAL  STABILITY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  1  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The seats won by the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party's (DPP's) in Saturday's elections show the voters'
desire for political stability, according to several scholars
interviewed by CNA Saturday night.</P>
      <P>The scholars predicted that political stability will result from
the elections, given that President Chen Shui-bian's power to name a
premier is solidified by his party's legislative gains, while the
leading opposition Kuomintang (KMT) is paying the price of deviating
from mainstream public opinion.</P>
      <P>They said they expect a "National Stabilization Alliance"
advocated by Chen before the election will take shape among lawmakers
of the DPP, the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU), some KMT lawmakers and
some independent lawmakers.</P>
      <P>Wu Yan-chun, a professor at National Chengchi University, said
that although Taiwan's recession is caused by the international
economic slowdown and the DPP government's inexperience in governing,
the voters chose to give the DPP dominance in both the executive and
legislative branches in Saturday's elections.</P>
      <P>He warned that the KMT should beware of the risk of being
marginalized because of its departure from mainstream public opinion.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the TSU's 13-seat gains on its political debut shows
that its emphasis on Taiwan's identity is appealing to many voters.</P>
      <P>Lee You-tan, another professor at National Chengchi University,
said he takes comfort from the public confirmation of the DPP as it
signifies that they did not buy the opposition's claims that the
ruling party should be blamed for the flagging economy.</P>
      <P>He predicted that Chen will be "more humble" in the remaining
years of his term in light of the fact that his party failed to gain
control of the legislature, but that he will not be dictated to by
the KMT and its allies at the legislature.</P>
      <P>He forecast that the elections will usher in a more stable period
in politics and added that the prospects for Chen's "National
Stabilization Alliance" are more real than ever.</P>
      <P>The DPP's legislative victory might harden its stance toward
Beijing, said Chang Lin-chen, a professor at National Taiwan
University.</P>
      <P>The DPP had to soften its position somewhat when the KMT still
dominated the legislature, but now that its policy toward Beijing has
won a new mandate, the party will have more leeway in dealing with
Beijing. It is hard to predict whether this bodes ill or good for the
country's ties with Beijing, she said.</P>
      <P>But she said she expects the Taipei authorities to get tough on
controversial issues such as the so-called "1992 consensus" on "one
China" and on direct postal and transport links with mainland China.</P>
      <P>Hsieh Cheng-yu, a professor at Soochow University, attributed the
KMT's loss in the elections to the split of its traditional voters
between the party and its breakaway, the People First Party.</P>
      <P>National Taiwan University Professor Alexander Lu said the TSU's
better-than-expected performance results from a shift toward a more
pro-independence stance among DPP voters worried about Beijing's
increasing international profile.</P>

    <HEADLINE>END OF POLLS MARKS BEGINNING OF INTER-PARTY COOPERATION: PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 2 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Saturday that
the conclusion of the legislative and local government chief
elections marks "the beginning of an era of cooperation."</P>
      <P>In a press release issued following the announcement of the
election results, Chen said all political parties should leave behind
their differences and pool their wisdom to revive the economy, reform
the legislature, promote relations across the Taiwan Strait and
improve social welfare.</P>
      <P>"Emotional conflict should now give way to rational thinking,"
Chen said.</P>
      <P>According to official results, Chen has obtained what he wanted
of the parliamentary polls -- his Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
has replaced the Kuomintang (KMT) as the largest party in the
Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>The DPP, which until Saturday had barely one-third of the seats
in the 225-member legislature, increased its presence to 87 seats --
an increase of about 40 percent. The main opposition KMT, with 110
seats going into the elections, managed to get only 68 candidates
elected.</P>
      <P>Two new parties formed by disgruntled KMT mavericks did well in
their first legislative elections. The People First Party (PFP) won
46 seats and the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU), with former KMT
Chairman and ex-ROC President Lee Teng-hui as its "spiritual leader,"
got 13, with the remaining seats won by independents and fringe
parties.</P>
      <P>After learning of the DPP's emergence as the biggest party in the
legislature, Premier Chang Chun-hsiung said the victory is a clear
indication that the electorate agrees with Chen's proposal for the
establishment of a "national stabilization alliance" and for the
enhancement of inter-party cooperation.</P>
      <P>"The proposal reflects the mainstream values of our society,"
Chang said, promising to carry it out as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The DPP garnered 36.57 percent of total votes cast in the
legislative elections, compared to the KMT's 31.28 percent, the PFP's
20.34 percent, the TSU's 8.5 percent and the New Party's 2.86
percent. The average voter turnout in the legislative polls was 66.16
percent.</P>
      <P>The pro-unification New Party won just one seat in the new
legislature, down from the nine it held prior to the election. The
party failed to win the minimum 5 percent of the vote it needed to
qualify for proportional representation seats. It also managed to win
only one local government position -- the magistrateship of the
frontline island of Kinmen, which lies closer to mainland China than
to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>New Party convener Hsieh Chi-ta, an incumbent legislator who lost
her re-election bid, said the party will not fade away, but will
"continue to flourish."</P>
      <P>Noting that many of incumbent New Party legislators have topped
the best-performing lawmakers list, she lamented that "their defeats
were great losses to the nation."</P>
      <P>Both Lee and TSU Chairman Huang Chu-wen said they were satisfied
with the party's showing in the polls. "The results also show that
the TSU did not win seats at the DPP's expense," said Huang.</P>
      <P>He further said the outcome indicates that the New Party's "one
country, two systems" unification advocacy and the KMT's insistence
on the existence of the "1992 consensus" (one China, with each side
free to interpret the notion as they see fit) do not enjoy popular
support.</P>
      <P>Huang, a former KMT member, predicted that the KMT will suffer
another split in the wake of the elections.</P>
      <P>KMT Chairman Lien Chan conceded the party's poor showing in the
legislative polls. He said as the KMT remains the largest opposition
party, it will do its utmost to help maintain domestic political
stability and promote inter-party cooperation after the elections.</P>
      <P>PFP Chairman James Soong said he was satisfied with the party's
showing. Soong, who lost his presidential bid last year by a narrow
margin, said he has no interest in joining any political alliances
but stressed that the PFP will endeavor to be a dutiful, responsible
opposition party.</P>
      <P>In the local elections that also took place Saturday, the KMT

      <P>The people of Taiwan made history last year by electing Chen
Shui-bian, the first president from an opposition party. But Chen's
inexperienced minority government has struggled to work with the
legislature and has been unable to thaw relations with mainland
China.</P>
      <P>Analysts said that mainland China viewed Chen to be a weak,
bungling president who wouldn't be re-elected and could be ignored.
But his party's victory Saturday might convince Beijing that Chen
could win another term. By continuing to ignore him, Chinese leaders
could cause Taiwan to drift further toward independence.</P>
      <P>Some of these analysts said the electoral outcome might prompt
mainaldn leaders to take a second thought on their strategy
toward Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAINLAND CHINESE SCHOLARS SEE CHANGES AFTER TAIWAN ELECTIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  1  (CNA)
(By  Sherman  Wu,  Neil  Lu, Jennifer J. Huang, Herman Pan, and Maubo
Chang )</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party's
(DPP) victory in elections for lawmakers has cast a shadow on
Taiwan's ties with mainland China, said some mainland Chinese
scholars, but U.S. scholars said Beijing may reconsider turning a
cold-shoulder to the Taipei government in the wake of Saturday's
power shift.</P>
      <P>Singapore's Chinese-language Lianhe Zhaobao daily quoted Beijing
officials as saying Sunday that they are alarmed and disappointed by
the DPP victory and the Kuomintang's (KMT) apparent failure in the
elections.</P>
      <P>In a story from Beijing, the paper quoted Yan Xuetung, a
professor at Tsinghua University in Beijing, as saying that he was
surprised that the economic sluggishness in Taiwan did not reduce the
popularity of the DPP, but instead boosted the pro-independence
party.</P>
      <P>Encouraged by the election victory, Yan said he believes
President Chen Shui-bian will be more confident in his pursuit of a
second term and will stick to his policy of seeking Taiwan
independence.</P>
      <P>The outcome of Saturday's elections in Taiwan bore out the fact
that economic factors have little, if any, impact on ties between
Taiwan and mainland China, and closer commercial exchanges between
the two sides doesn't necessary improve their political ties, Yan
said.</P>
      <P>Beijing should work out new ways to discourage the
pro-independence force in Taiwan, rather than move toward closer
economic interactions, Yan said.</P>
      <P>The paper quoted another Tsinhua University professor, Chu
Shulung, as pointing out that the results of the elections will
inevitably harden President Chen denial of the so-called "1992
consensus" between Taiwan and mainland China on "one China," perhaps
even emboldening him to go further on the path toward Taiwan
independence.</P>
      <P>But Chu said the results of the elections are unlikely to prompt
Beijing to change its approach regarding Chen: "Listen to his words,
watch his deeds."</P>
      <P>Yu Keli, deputy director of the Institute of Taiwan Studies
under the Chinese Academy of Social Science in Beijing told the
Lianhe Zhaobao that he doesn't think Chen will move recklessly when
it comes to ties with Beijing, even with the new mandate from the
people.</P>
      <P>Although the KMT has lost its leading place in the legislature,
it is still a force to be reckoned with given the majority of seats
controlled by it and its political allies, and the DPP should know
that it cannot independently set mainland China policy, Yu said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Robert Scalapino, a Chinese affairs expert in the
United States, said in Los Angels Saturday that Beijing should
reconsider its approach toward Taiwan in light of the DPP's victory.</P>
      <P>The former professor at the University of California in Berkeley,
California said the results of the elections suggest that Beijing
might be wrong to think that the DPP has its hands tied by Taiwan's
opposition-controlled Legislative Yuan, and time is on Beijing's side
in dealing with Taipei.</P>
      <P>With DPP's power base solidified and it's time for Beijing to
review its current no-contact policy toward Taipei, Scalapino said.</P>
      <P>Another significant development from the elections is the People
First Party's dramatic gain to 46 seats -- a shot in the arm for the
party and its chairman, James Soong, Scalapino said, adding that the
party will now become a power broker in the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Ramon Myers, a researcher at the Hoover Institution, said that
the DPP has more leeway in crafting its mainland China policy after
the elections.</P>
      <P>It is unrealistic for Beijing to wait and deal with Taiwan until
after a non-DPP government emerges on the island some time in the
future, Myers said.</P>
      <P>Instead, he said, Beijing should open dialogue with the DPP under
the framework of a confederation and treat Taiwan as a equal partner
under it.</P>
      <P>Former U.S. Ambassador to Beijing James Lilley said in Washington
Saturday that Beijing should not consider the results of Saturday's
elections as a spurn to its offer of reunion with Taiwan; rather, it
should be seen as a further step by Taiwan toward "the middle way"
and developing a responsive democracy.</P>
      <P>Beijing should wake up to the fact that it simply cannot impose
its will on Taiwan, and its ties with Taiwan will not improve when it
targets Taiwan with missiles, Lilley said.</P>
      <P>Larry Wortzel, a researcher at the Heritage Foundation in
Washington said Saturday that the elections have further shown the
benefits of the development of a multi-party democracy and a vibrant
civil society in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan has been reshaped and President Chen will
have a better chance to break political deadlocks by working to build
political coalitions and consensuses on specific issues, Wortzel
said.</P>
      <P>The results of the elections also validated Presdient Chen's
policies of economic engagement and a political rejection of
Beijing's "one-China" formula, he said.</P>
      <P>The KMT's failure in the elections, on the other hand, means that
their platform is less attractive to many Taiwanese and the party
should reconsider its platform, he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NO SUBSTANTIVE CHANGES IN CROSS-STRAIT TIES AFTER  ELECTIONS: ANALYSTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  2  (CNA)
(By Bear Lee)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>No significant changes are expected in
relations across the Taiwan Strait following the Dec. 1 elections in
Taiwan, analysts attending a symposium Sunday in Taipei said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's first elections of the century saw the Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) replace the Kuomintang as the largest party
in the legislature by securing 87 seats, compared to the KMT's 68,
the People First Party's (PFP) 46 and the Taiwan Solidarity Union's
(TSU) 13.</P>
      <P>The symposium, which focused on future political realignments
after the elections and the prospects of cross-strait relations, was
sponsored by Taiwan's Central News Agency and was held at its Taipei
headquarters.</P>
      <P>Stephen Chen, deputy head of the National Policy Foundation, a
think tank of the opposition Kuomintang, said that due to the huge
gap between the DPP and KMT in their national identification, it
would be impossible for the KMT to join the "National Stabilization
Alliance" that President Chen Shui-bian proposed before the
elections.</P>
      <P>However, he said that there is room for cooperation between the
KMT and the PFP, one of the splinter groups of the KMT.</P>
      <P>Chin Chin-sheng, PFP deputy secretary-general, said that the PFP
will only come to a decision on a possible alliance with other
parties after comprehensive discussions within the party.</P>
      <P>He said that the PFP, formed only after last year's presidential
election, is an independent party and "will not move towards either
the KMT or the DPP."</P>
      <P>Professor Ming Chu-cheng of National Taiwan University said that
it would not be difficult for the DPP to form a cross-party alliance
if it can get the participation from some of the KMT
legislators-elect who have some leanings toward the pro-independence
stance of the ruling party since the DPP, along with the
pro-independence TSU, now controls 100 legislative seats.</P>
      <P>On future relations with the mainland, Chen, who once served as
Taiwan's top representative to the United States, said that the
DPP-led administration will maintain is current policy toward the
mainland, and ties will not undergo any big changes in the short
term.</P>
      <P>Chin said that for the sake of Taiwan's stability, the DPP
government must adopt a steady and clear mainland policy.</P>
      <P>Tien Hsin, director of the DPP's International Affairs
Department, said that the ruling party has made it clear in its
"Resolution on the Future of Taiwan" that it will respect the choice
of the Taiwan people to become independent or unify with the
mainland.</P>
      <P>Tien stressed, however, that Taiwan should not mention the
so-called "1992 consensus" that was alleged by the opposition to have
been reached between Taipei and Beijing in 1992.</P>
      <P>The consensus refers to an alleged tacit understanding that was
reached between the two sides that they would accept a "one China"
principle with each side being free to have its own definition of
"one China."</P>
      <P>The DPP administration has repeatedly denied that any consensus
was reached; rather, it says that the only thing achieved was a
"spirit of 1992."</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT  CHEN  GIVEN  REAL MANDATE TO GOVERN: FORMER DPP CHAIRMAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  2  (CNA)
(By Edward Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The results of Saturday's elections for
legislators and city and county chiefs have proven that the people
will give President Chen Shui-bian a real chance to govern, former
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairman Shih Ming-teh said
Sunday.</P>
      <P>The results of the election prove that the people agree with
President Chen's political programs, Shih said. He hoped that
President Chen would now take full responsibility for resolving the
unemployment issue, upgrade the nation's competitiveness and
stabilize the political situation.</P>
      <P>Shih lost his re-election race for a legislative seat as an
independent. He said that he was somewhat surprised by the loss and
that he would have to take some time to consider his political
future.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Parris Chang of the DPP, who was re-elected as a
legislator, said that Beijing must be very disappointed with the
legislative election results. The DPP victory shows that Beijing's
strategy to press the Chen administration to accept the "1992
consensus" and "one China" principle through opposition pressure was
a complete failure.</P>
      <P>He hoped that Beijing will reassess and reevaluate its
cross-strait strategy.</P>
      <P>Chang made the remarks while attending a seminar on post-election
Taiwan political developments sponsored by the Vanguard Policy
Research Center.</P>
      <P>Chang attributed the DPP wins to the DPP's insistence on the
nation's sovereignty and highlighting the opposition's appeasement
toward Beijing.</P>
      <P>Prof. Ke Yung-kuang of National Taiwan University said that how
to deal with the "one China" issue is still a sticky issue. He said,
however, that the ruling DPP should embrace the "1992 consensus."</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT SAYS IT WILL NOT JOIN PRESIDENT CHEN'S ALLIANCE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 2 (CNA)
(By Bear Lee)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The leading opposition Kuomintang (KMT) will
not join the "National Stabilization Alliance" that President Chen
Shui-bian proposed last week, a party spokesman said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The KMT made the decision after a review of its election results,
according to KMT spokesman Wang Chih-kang.</P>
      <P>The number of seats in the Legislature held by the KMT plummeted
to 68 from 123 before the Dec. 1 elections. The party was also
soundly defeated in the 2000 presidential election when its
candidate, now-KMT Chairman Lien Chan, came in a distant third.</P>
      <P>Wang said that the KMT, however, is more than willing to hold
party-to-party negotiations with the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) and that Lien is also willing to meet President Chen to
exchange views on the domestic political situation.</P>
      <P>Lien presided over the election result review meeting along with
the participation of the vice-chairmen of the party, Wu Poh-hsiung,
Chiang Chun-ling, Vincent Siew, Wang Jyn-ping and Lin Cheng-chih. KMT
Secretary-General Lin Fong-cheng was also in attendance with other
ranking party officials.</P>
      <P>The KMT will seek to expand cooperation with the People First
Party (PFP) in the legislature, Wang said.</P>
      <P>The PFP, formed by former KMT Secretary-General James Soong after
last year's presidential election, obtained 46 seats in addition to
two county magistrateships.</P>
      <P>He said that the KMT will field Vice Chairman Wang Jyn-ping, the
incumbent Legislative Yuan president, to run for a second term as
head of the lawmaking body.</P>
      <P>The KMT, however, said that in spite of its disappointing showing
in the legislative elections, it still managed to do relatively well
in the elections for local government heads by winning nine of the 23
seats up for grabs, increasing its numbers by one.</P>
      <P>Wang said that Lien will continue to be the leader of the party
with firm support from the five vice chairmen and party leaders.</P>
      <P>Chao Shou-po, head of the KMT Organizational Affairs Department,
attributed the party's failure in the elections to several factors:</P>
      <P>-- Strong campaign activities by President Chen and effective
publicity by the DPP;</P>
      <P>-- Ceaseless mudslinging from the DPP against the KMT;</P>
      <P>-- Former President and former KMT Chairman Lee Teng-hui's
stumping for candidates of the Taiwan Solidarity Union, and its
veiled cooperation with the DPP; and</P>
      <P>-- A lack of solidarity among KMT candidates.</P>
      <P>KMT Secretary-General Lin said that he has tendered his
resignation to Chairman Lien to take responsibility for the setbacks.
It is still unknown, however, whether Lien will allow him to leave.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ELECTIONS HELP CONVERGE OPINIONS ON NATIONAL IDENTITY: DPP LAWMAKER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  2  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The collapse of the pro-unification New
Party in Saturday's elections will help converge public opinion on
Taiwan's national identity, Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
legislator Lin Cho-shui said Sunday.</P>
      <P>In a symposium sponsored by the Taiwan Research Institute on the
elections of lawmakers, Lin said the sudden demise of the New Party,
which succeeded in returning only one lawmaker, signifies a shift of
public opinion toward acknowledging Taiwan's separate identity.</P>
      <P>The sudden emergence in politics of the pro-independence Taiwan
Solidarity Union (TSU), which snapped up 13 seats on its political
debut, is more evidence of the political appeal of Taiwan's
sovereignty and political stability.</P>
      <P>The DPP's sweep of counties in the south of the country in the
races for magistrates and mayors suggested that voters didn't blame
the ruling party for the economic slowdown despite these counties
suffering the most in the island's recession and accounting for the
bulk of Taiwan's unemployment population, Lin said.</P>
      <P>After the 2000 presidential election and Saturday's elections,
Lin said, Beijing should shed its unrealistic expectations for Taiwan
and try to establish new working relations with the island's
officials.</P>
      <P>Another message that emerged from the elections is the strong
party-orientation among local voters, which is contrary to the widely
accepted conception that they are attracted more by candidates'
personal merits than by their political affiliation, Lin said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Fan Xitsou, director of the Institute of Taiwan
Studies at Xiamen University in Xiamen, Fujian province, said Sunday
by phone that Saturday's elections are nothing but a political
shake-up among Taiwan's political parties and will not bear on its
ties with mainland China.</P>
      <P>This is why Beijing didn't bother to comment on the elections
before or after Saturday, he said. The results of the elections will
certainly not change Beijing's basic principles in dealing with
Taiwan, that is "separating economic affairs from political affairs,"
and engaging with Taiwan on the basis of "one China," Fan said.</P>
      <P>However, Fan said, Beijing did take note of the strong
anti-Beijing sentiments during the campaign and will continue
applying pressure on Taiwan to stop such activities. Officials in
Beijing, however, do not consider that the DPP's new mandate will
strengthen its hand in dealing with Beijing, Fan said.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan affairs expert said the failure of the Kuomintang
(KMT) was because it had fielded too many candidates and had to
contend with the division of its traditional supporters between
itself and its breakaway party, the People First Party (PFP).</P>
      <P>He predicted the KMT will have trouble making a political
comeback if it cannot transform itself into a party more attractive
to grassroots voters. With a successful transformation, Fan said, the
KMT might cooperate with the emerging PFP, but if not, the party
could be replaced by the PFP.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SCHOLARS POSITIVE ON TAIWAN'S DEMOCRACY, BUT SAY CHALLENGES AHEAD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei. Dec. 2 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Scholars gathered at a symposium Sunday were
generally positive about the result of the elections and the
democratic development in Taiwan, but also said that many challenges
lie ahead for the nation.</P>
      <P>An international symposium on democratic consolidation, peace and
security was jointly sponsored by National Chengchi University (NCCU)
and the Government Information Office. Scholars and experts from 10
countries were invited to discuss the significance on Asia and the
Pacific region of Taiwan's democratic progress and their observations
regarding Saturday's elections.</P>
      <P>The scholars praised Taiwan for achieving a high level of
democratization without serious conflicts or violence.</P>
      <P>On the possibility of an upcoming political realignment, they
said that the next few months will be crucial for Taiwan. The key is
to observe whether the executive and legislative branches can work
smoother now that the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has
become the largest party in the legislature.</P>
      <P>The DPP increased its seats from 65 before the elections to 87,
while the original dominant force in the lawmaking body, the
Kuomintang (KMT), faltered after shedding 42 seats to take just 68,
far below what the party had expected.</P>
      <P>Shelley Rigger, a long-time observer of Taiwan's elections and
associate professor of Davidson College in North Caroline, believed
that the success of the DPP could be attributed to its "early
preparation of its candidate list, conscientious devotion to party
unity through the campaign," and its vote rationing strategy, a point
NCCU professor Liu I-chou, also director of Election Study Center,
had made earlier.</P>
      <P>The success of the DPP, Rigger said, may not be solely
interpreted as "a referendum on President Chen Shui-bian's
performance," which has been marred by political squabbling over
the past 17 months, but to a greater extent to the party's
mastery of the media. The KMT failed to "manage the campaign in a way
that a party must do," she said.</P>
      <P>Robert Sutter, a professor at Georgetown University, cautioned
that Taiwan's democracy has yet been consolidated, saying that
although the mandate of the minority government will be strengthened,
it will be limited. He said that Taiwan will face many challenges in
the next few years, noting that consultation with the opposition camp
will be difficult as will be implementing political reforms.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taiwan's "greatest challenge will be to keep its
economy competitive," while the other side of the Taiwan Strait
continues its military buildup, Sutter said.</P>
      <P>Thomas Gold, an associate professor at the University of
California-Berkeley, noted the Taiwan will face economic problems as
part of the global economic downturn, and ethnic problems within the
nation, and power has yet to be consolidated with the gaining of
seats in the legislature by the DPP.</P>
      <P>However, Gold said that it was a positive sign that the election
was conducted without serious physical violence, proving that
democracy in Taiwan was not fake as some commentators had claimed.</P>
      <P>Alan Wachman, an assistant professor at Tufts University, said
that Taiwan's democracy is marching in a peaceful and gradual way,
and will stimulate mainland China to some extent.</P>
      <P>Democracy, however, is not the solution to all problems, he
cautioned, and what counts will be the improvement of the quality of
democracy.</P>
      <P>Tim Trampedach, a professor at Berlin Free University, agreed,
noting that cross-strait economies may move closer, but that tensions
will remain, judging from the fact that there is a lack of unity
among candidates on national security issues.</P>
      <P>The future of the KMT has also became a focal point, Wachman
said, noting that the KMT had taken quite a blow and wondered how
seriously the KMT is taking its losses.</P>
      <P>Rigger said that the KMT is no more prepared to face defeat than
it was in last year's presidential election, saying that it made
bitter, angry-sounding statements after Saturday's elections.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NO CHANGE ON CROSS-STRAIT POLICY AFTER ELECTION: MAC HEAD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  2 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Cross-strait policy will not undergo major
changes after the elections which saw the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party increased its seats dramatically in the legislature
to become the largest party in the lawmaking body, the nation's top
planner in charting the mainland policy said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Tsai Eng-wen, chairwoman of the Mainland Affairs Council, made
the remarks when she delivered a keynote speech at an international
symposium on democratic consolidation, peace and security across
the Taiwan Strait held at the Grand Hotel in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Tsai told scholars and experts participating in the symposium
that the theme of cross-strait relations will remain peace, stability
and non-provocation.</P>
      <P>One day after the mandate of the DPP was strengthened by
increasing its seats in the 225-seat legislature to 87, she said that
the major task of the government now will be to continue to carry on
political reforms and speed up the globalization of Taiwan's economy.</P>
      <P>On cross-strait relations, she said the maintenance of peace will
be of top priority, stressing that cross-strait policy will not
change because of the results of the elections despite Beijing's
misgivings about the pro-independence stance of the DPP.</P>
      <P>Tsai said that the government's cross-strait policy is
unequivocal -- on the one hand, it will continue to seek consensus
within domestic parties, and on the other it hopes both sides of the
Taiwan Strait will be able to sit down to talk. This she said would
be the best way to ease misunderstandings.</P>
      <P>She noted that the government has adjusted its financial policy
toward the mainland, adding that there will be further and gradual
adjustments over time.</P>
      <P>On President Chen Shui-bian's mainland policy, she stressed that
there has been no change, citing the president's "five noes" as
spelled out in his inauguration speech -- meaning no declaration of
independence if Beijing does not use force against the island, no
change of the nation's official name, no adoption of the
"state-to-state" theory into the Constitution, no referendum on the
fate of the nation, and no abrogation of the Guidelines of National
Unification. Chen also spoke of the cultural and economic integration
between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait before the establishment
of a mechanism of political integration.</P>
      <P>Tsai noted that the mainland has so far not made a major response
to the result of the elections, but she believed the mainland will
realize that maintaining the peace and stability across the Taiwan
Strait will be of common interests to both sides.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIPEI MAYOR OPTIMISTIC ABOUT CONSOLIDATION OF POLITICAL PARTIES</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou said Saturday that
the joint nomination of Wang Chien-shien by three parties as
candidate for Taipei county magistrate "proves the feasibility" of
consolidating the strength of the Kuomintang (KMT), the People First

    <HEADLINE>DPP REPLACES KMT AS LARGEST PARTY IN LEGISLATURE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  1 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian has obtained what
he wanted of the parliamentary elections -- his Democratic
Progressives Party replacing the Kuomintang as the largest party in
the Legislative Yuan -- but whether that electoral victory can be
translated into swift government action to tackle daunting problems
facing Taiwan remains to be seen.</P>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) won 87 of the 225
seats in the unicameral legislature Saturday. The Kuomintang, the
largest party with 110 seats going into the elections, managed to get
only 68 candidates elected.</P>
      <P>With the help of the 13 Taiwan Solidary Union (TSU) freshmen
lawmakers, President Chen's DPP is ready to assume parliamentary
leadership, which the administration badly needs to end the
paralyzing grip the Kuomintang has on the outgoing legislature.</P>
      <P>The parliamentary leadership alone is not enough to get things
going for the Chen administration, according to a majority view of
political observers.</P>
      <P>There will be no parliamentary majority, observers said after the
results of the elections were published. The DPP will still confront
the opposition with nine independents controlling a majority of
legislative seats. The People First Party (PFP), the third largest in
the Legilative Yuan closely behind the Kuomintang with 46 seats, will
continue to oppose the DPP.</P>
      <P>Without that majority, the DPP is likely to be thwarted in much
of parliamentary legislation it has to enact to remedy the economic
and financial woes Taiwan has been suffering since President Chen
assumed office in May last year.</P>
      <P>Unemployment has hit a record high 5.33 percent. Gross domestic
product is expected to post an unprecedented negative growth for
2000. Financial institutions have been saddled with bad debts topping
NT$1 trillion. The terrorist attacks on the United States on Sept. 11
have dealt a crippling blow to the already ailing economy.</P>
      <P>The ruling party will continue to experience a parliamentary
stand-off, although much mitigated, unless it will be able to lure a
sufficient number of Kuomintang defectors and independents into its
fold.</P>
      <P>That is exactly what President Chen hopes to do by proposing a
"national stabilization alliance," which, however, has been rejected
by the Kuomintang and its splinter group, the PFP.</P>
      <P>The PFP was a clear victor in the heated parliamentary race. It
won the 46 legislative seats, plus two county magistrateships in
Taitung and on the offshore island of Matsu.</P>
      <P>James Soong, PFP chairman, was not elected to the Legislative
Yuan. He had ranked himself 11th on the PFP candidate list for
proportional representation, and narrowly lost because the party
failed to win two million votes or over 21 percent of the total cast.
Nontheless, he has boosted his chance of bearing the standard in the
2004 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Soong founded the PFP after he had lost last year's presidential
race.</P>
      <P>He spared no effort to campaign for PFP candidates, and for Wang
Chien-shien who, even with the support of the Kuomintang, and the New
Party, failed to beat incumbent DPP Magistrate Su Cheng-chang of
Taipei County.</P>
      <P>The Taipei county race was touted as a proving ground for the
next presidential election, in which President Chen is certain to be
pitted against a candidate with united opposition support like Wang,
who was not able to consolidate his tripartite alliance against Su.</P>
      <P>While suffering a near disaster in the legislative elections, the
Kuomintang could take comfort in adding two to the number of its
seven outgoing county magistrates and city mayors. It now occupies
nine such offices.</P>
      <P>Like the Kuomintang, the DPP collected nine local government
posts, including the one in Taipei County, while the tiny opposition
New Party won the magistrateship of Kinmen. Independents earned the
remaining two of the 23 offices at stake.</P>
      <P>The TSU, a new party former President Lee Teng-hui helped found
only three months before the elections, made an spectacle showing.
Its 13 candidates, all of them political new faces, rode in the
"coattail" of Lee, who, though not running himself, tirelessly
stumped for them.</P>
      <P>The biggest loser was the New Party. Reduced to only one seat, it
lost the right to elect any lawmaker in accordance with proportional
representation.</P>

evening the end of elections should be "the beginning of cooperation"

(By Tzeng Chun-liang and Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Political observers in Beijing said
Saturday that they were surprised by the election results in Taiwan
whereby the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) replaced the
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) as the largest party in the Legislative
Yuan.</P>
      <P>Xu Bodong, director of the Taiwan Research Institute at Beijing
Union University, said that the DPP's victory can be attributed to
its successful ballot distribution strategy while it demonstrates
that its supporters' identification with the party is more stable.</P>
      <P>Xu predicted that Taiwan's political quagmire will continue after
the elections, and he believes that even if the independence-leaning
"pan-green" parties, which includes the DPP, had won an overall
majority, the "pan-blues" would have probably become even more united
after the elections to fight against the "pan-greens."</P>
      <P>Because the KMT lost the largest number of seats, Xu continued,
it remains to be seen whether the party will split again. He said
that the KMT is still the biggest variable affecting Taiwan's
political situation and that the key is whether a faction within the
party that favors native Taiwanese over those of mainland Chinese
descent will leave at the urging of former President Lee Teng-hui.</P>
      <P>A former KMT chairman who was expelled from the party in
September, Lee is the "spiritual leader" of the fledgling Taiwan
Solidarity Union, which is a member of the so-called "pan-green"
parties.</P>
      <P>Xu said that although a period of uneasy peace can still be
maintained in the Taiwan Strait as long as Chen does not publicly
announce Taiwan independence, bilateral relations remain unstable and
full of danger.</P>
      <P>Guo Zhenyuan, a senior fellow at the China Institute of
International Studies, a Beijing government think tank, said that the
DPP's surprising victory will not change Beijing's policy of
continuing to observe Chen, especially as some of the things he said

      <P>Foreign trade and industry offices and
domestic industry leaders in Taiwan urged the newly elected
Legislative Yuan to focus on economic issues after Saturday's
legislative, county chief and mayoral elections.</P>
      <P>Noting that he has been in Taiwan for eight years and has
witnessed several elections, American Chamber of Commerce in Taipei
(AmCham) President Richard Henson urged Taiwan's political parties to
forgo their differences and concentrate on the economy instead of
continuing to "play the economy like politics."</P>
      <P>European Chamber of Commerce Taipei (ECCT) Chairman Fabrice de
Murat also urged the government to focus on the economy because
foreign businesses consider the local political situation this year
to have been "unstable."</P>
      <P>AmCham Executive Director Richard Vuylsteke said that Taiwan is
still politicking while mainland China is already devoting itself
fully to its economy. He added that foreign businessmen want to see
the "beef" in the government's policies, not campaign mudslinging.</P>
      <P>Henson said that as the power and influence of the Legislative
Yuan grows, Taiwan politicians should realize that partisan
cooperation is important, particularly in order to achieve consensus
on economic issues.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ELECTION OUTCOMES WILL LEAD TO MORE POLITICAL  STABILITY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  1  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The seats won by the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party's (DPP's) in Saturday's elections show the voters'
desire for political stability, according to several scholars
interviewed by CNA Saturday night.</P>
      <P>The scholars predicted that political stability will result from
the elections, given that President Chen Shui-bian's power to name a
premier is solidified by his party's legislative gains, while the
leading opposition Kuomintang (KMT) is paying the price of deviating
from mainstream public opinion.</P>
      <P>They said they expect a "National Stabilization Alliance"
advocated by Chen before the election will take shape among lawmakers
of the DPP, the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU), some KMT lawmakers and
some independent lawmakers.</P>
      <P>Wu Yan-chun, a professor at National Chengchi University, said
that although Taiwan's recession is caused by the international
economic slowdown and the DPP government's inexperience in governing,
the voters chose to give the DPP dominance in both the executive and
legislative branches in Saturday's elections.</P>
      <P>He warned that the KMT should beware of the risk of being
marginalized because of its departure from mainstream public opinion.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the TSU's 13-seat gains on its political debut shows
that its emphasis on Taiwan's identity is appealing to many voters.</P>
      <P>Lee You-tan, another professor at National Chengchi University,
said he takes comfort from the public confirmation of the DPP as it
signifies that they did not buy the opposition's claims that the
ruling party should be blamed for the flagging economy.</P>
      <P>He predicted that Chen will be "more humble" in the remaining
years of his term in light of the fact that his party failed to gain
control of the legislature, but that he will not be dictated to by
the KMT and its allies at the legislature.</P>
      <P>He forecast that the elections will usher in a more stable period
in politics and added that the prospects for Chen's "National
Stabilization Alliance" are more real than ever.</P>
      <P>The DPP's legislative victory might harden its stance toward
Beijing, said Chang Lin-chen, a professor at National Taiwan
University.</P>
      <P>The DPP had to soften its position somewhat when the KMT still
dominated the legislature, but now that its policy toward Beijing has
won a new mandate, the party will have more leeway in dealing with
Beijing. It is hard to predict whether this bodes ill or good for the
country's ties with Beijing, she said.</P>
      <P>But she said she expects the Taipei authorities to get tough on
controversial issues such as the so-called "1992 consensus" on "one
China" and on direct postal and transport links with mainland China.</P>
      <P>Hsieh Cheng-yu, a professor at Soochow University, attributed the
KMT's loss in the elections to the split of its traditional voters
between the party and its breakaway, the People First Party.</P>
      <P>National Taiwan University Professor Alexander Lu said the TSU's
better-than-expected performance results from a shift toward a more
pro-independence stance among DPP voters worried about Beijing's
increasing international profile.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 2 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Saturday that
the conclusion of the legislative and local government chief
elections marks "the beginning of an era of cooperation."</P>
      <P>In a press release issued following the announcement of the
election results, Chen said all political parties should leave behind
their differences and pool their wisdom to revive the economy, reform
the legislature, promote relations across the Taiwan Strait and
improve social welfare.</P>
      <P>"Emotional conflict should now give way to rational thinking,"
Chen said.</P>
      <P>According to official results, Chen has obtained what he wanted
of the parliamentary polls -- his Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
has replaced the Kuomintang (KMT) as the largest party in the
Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>The DPP, which until Saturday had barely one-third of the seats
in the 225-member legislature, increased its presence to 87 seats --
an increase of about 40 percent. The main opposition KMT, with 110
seats going into the elections, managed to get only 68 candidates
elected.</P>
      <P>Two new parties formed by disgruntled KMT mavericks did well in
their first legislative elections. The People First Party (PFP) won
46 seats and the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU), with former KMT
Chairman and ex-ROC President Lee Teng-hui as its "spiritual leader,"
got 13, with the remaining seats won by independents and fringe
parties.</P>
      <P>After learning of the DPP's emergence as the biggest party in the
legislature, Premier Chang Chun-hsiung said the victory is a clear
indication that the electorate agrees with Chen's proposal for the
establishment of a "national stabilization alliance" and for the
enhancement of inter-party cooperation.</P>
      <P>"The proposal reflects the mainstream values of our society,"
Chang said, promising to carry it out as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The DPP garnered 36.57 percent of total votes cast in the
legislative elections, compared to the KMT's 31.28 percent, the PFP's
20.34 percent, the TSU's 8.5 percent and the New Party's 2.86
percent. The average voter turnout in the legislative polls was 66.16
percent.</P>
      <P>The pro-unification New Party won just one seat in the new
legislature, down from the nine it held prior to the election. The
party failed to win the minimum 5 percent of the vote it needed to
qualify for proportional representation seats. It also managed to win
only one local government position -- the magistrateship of the
frontline island of Kinmen, which lies closer to mainland China than
to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>New Party convener Hsieh Chi-ta, an incumbent legislator who lost
her re-election bid, said the party will not fade away, but will
"continue to flourish."</P>
      <P>Noting that many of incumbent New Party legislators have topped
the best-performing lawmakers list, she lamented that "their defeats
were great losses to the nation."</P>
      <P>Both Lee and TSU Chairman Huang Chu-wen said they were satisfied
with the party's showing in the polls. "The results also show that
the TSU did not win seats at the DPP's expense," said Huang.</P>
      <P>He further said the outcome indicates that the New Party's "one
country, two systems" unification advocacy and the KMT's insistence
on the existence of the "1992 consensus" (one China, with each side
free to interpret the notion as they see fit) do not enjoy popular
support.</P>
      <P>Huang, a former KMT member, predicted that the KMT will suffer
another split in the wake of the elections.</P>
      <P>KMT Chairman Lien Chan conceded the party's poor showing in the
legislative polls. He said as the KMT remains the largest opposition
party, it will do its utmost to help maintain domestic political
stability and promote inter-party cooperation after the elections.</P>
      <P>PFP Chairman James Soong said he was satisfied with the party's
showing. Soong, who lost his presidential bid last year by a narrow
margin, said he has no interest in joining any political alliances
but stressed that the PFP will endeavor to be a dutiful, responsible
opposition party.</P>
      <P>In the local elections that also took place Saturday, the KMT
managed to win mayorships and magistrateships in six previously
DPP-ruled cities and counties -- Taichung City, Keelung City,
Taichung County, Taoyuan County, Hsinchu City and Hsinchu County.</P>
      <P>The DPP also won nine local government chief posts, while the PFP
won in Taitung County and the outlying Lienchiang County, which
covers the island of Matsu and lies closer to the mainland than to
Taiwan. (By sofia Wu) (To be continued)</P>

International Studies, a Beijing government think tank, said that the
DPP's surprising victory will not change Beijing's policy of
continuing to observe Chen, especially as some of the things he said
during the campaign have deepened Beijing's distrust toward him.</P>
      <P>Therefore, Guo predicted, it is difficult to see any concrete
development in cross-Taiwan Strait relations after the elections.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FOREIGN, LOCAL COMMERCE LEADERS URGE LEGISLATORS TO FOCUS ON ECONOMY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  1  (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Foreign trade and industry offices and
domestic industry leaders in Taiwan urged the newly elected
Legislative Yuan to focus on economic issues after Saturday's
legislative, county chief and mayoral elections.</P>
      <P>Noting that he has been in Taiwan for eight years and has
witnessed several elections, American Chamber of Commerce in Taipei
(AmCham) President Richard Henson urged Taiwan's political parties to
forgo their differences and concentrate on the economy instead of
continuing to "play the economy like politics."</P>
      <P>European Chamber of Commerce Taipei (ECCT) Chairman Fabrice de
Murat also urged the government to focus on the economy because
foreign businesses consider the local political situation this year
to have been "unstable."</P>
      <P>AmCham Executive Director Richard Vuylsteke said that Taiwan is
still politicking while mainland China is already devoting itself
fully to its economy. He added that foreign businessmen want to see
the "beef" in the government's policies, not campaign mudslinging.</P>
      <P>Henson said that as the power and influence of the Legislative
Yuan grows, Taiwan politicians should realize that partisan
cooperation is important, particularly in order to achieve consensus
on economic issues.</P>
      <P>He added that AmCham has begun to realize that foreign businesses
must turn more of their lobbying efforts toward the Legislative Yuan
as Taiwan's democratization continues.</P>
      <P>Agreeing with his foreign counterparts, Taiwan Chamber of
Commerce President Chuang Lung-chang said that he hopes the
legislators can focus on response measures to Taiwan's imminent World
Trade Organization entry.</P>

      <P>Hau Lung-bin, former convener of the New
Party's (NP's) National Campaign and Development Committee, said
Saturday evening that his party failed to appeal to Taiwan's voters
"because they did not cast their votes rationally."</P>
      <P>He called on party supporters to "deal rationally" with the
election results. The NP won only one legislative seat and one county
magistrate position in the Saturday elections.</P>
      <P>The party, which was founded in 1993 by a group of young
Kuomintang (KMT) members who broke away from the KMT to seek a new
path to balance the then-ruling party, held nine seat in the previous

    <HEADLINE>ELECTION OUTCOMES WILL LEAD TO MORE POLITICAL  STABILITY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  1  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The seats won by the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party's (DPP's) in Saturday's elections show the voters'
desire for political stability, according to several scholars
interviewed by CNA Saturday night.</P>
      <P>The scholars predicted that political stability will result from
the elections, given that President Chen Shui-bian's power to name a
premier is solidified by his party's legislative gains, while the
leading opposition Kuomintang (KMT) is paying the price of deviating
from mainstream public opinion.</P>
      <P>They said they expect a "National Stabilization Alliance"
advocated by Chen before the election will take shape among lawmakers
of the DPP, the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU), some KMT lawmakers and
some independent lawmakers.</P>
      <P>Wu Yan-chun, a professor at National Chengchi University, said
that although Taiwan's recession is caused by the international
economic slowdown and the DPP government's inexperience in governing,
the voters chose to give the DPP dominance in both the executive and
legislative branches in Saturday's elections.</P>
      <P>He warned that the KMT should beware of the risk of being
marginalized because of its departure from mainstream public opinion.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the TSU's 13-seat gains on its political debut shows
that its emphasis on Taiwan's identity is appealing to many voters.</P>
      <P>Lee You-tan, another professor at National Chengchi University,
said he takes comfort from the public confirmation of the DPP as it
signifies that they did not buy the opposition's claims that the
ruling party should be blamed for the flagging economy.</P>
      <P>He predicted that Chen will be "more humble" in the remaining
years of his term in light of the fact that his party failed to gain
control of the legislature, but that he will not be dictated to by
the KMT and its allies at the legislature.</P>
      <P>He forecast that the elections will usher in a more stable period
in politics and added that the prospects for Chen's "National
Stabilization Alliance" are more real than ever.</P>
      <P>The DPP's legislative victory might harden its stance toward
Beijing, said Chang Lin-chen, a professor at National Taiwan
University.</P>
      <P>The DPP had to soften its position somewhat when the KMT still
dominated the legislature, but now that its policy toward Beijing has
won a new mandate, the party will have more leeway in dealing with
Beijing. It is hard to predict whether this bodes ill or good for the
country's ties with Beijing, she said.</P>
      <P>But she said she expects the Taipei authorities to get tough on
controversial issues such as the so-called "1992 consensus" on "one
China" and on direct postal and transport links with mainland China.</P>
      <P>Hsieh Cheng-yu, a professor at Soochow University, attributed the
KMT's loss in the elections to the split of its traditional voters
between the party and its breakaway, the People First Party.</P>
      <P>National Taiwan University Professor Alexander Lu said the TSU's
better-than-expected performance results from a shift toward a more
pro-independence stance among DPP voters worried about Beijing's
increasing international profile.</P>

    <HEADLINE>END OF POLLS MARKS BEGINNING OF INTER-PARTY COOPERATION: PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 2 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Saturday that
the conclusion of the legislative and local government chief
elections marks "the beginning of an era of cooperation."</P>
      <P>In a press release issued following the announcement of the
election results, Chen said all political parties should leave behind
their differences and pool their wisdom to revive the economy, reform
the legislature, promote relations across the Taiwan Strait and
improve social welfare.</P>
      <P>"Emotional conflict should now give way to rational thinking,"
Chen said.</P>
      <P>According to official results, Chen has obtained what he wanted
of the parliamentary polls -- his Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
has replaced the Kuomintang (KMT) as the largest party in the
Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>The DPP, which until Saturday had barely one-third of the seats
in the 225-member legislature, increased its presence to 87 seats --
an increase of about 40 percent. The main opposition KMT, with 110
seats going into the elections, managed to get only 68 candidates
elected.</P>
      <P>Two new parties formed by disgruntled KMT mavericks did well in
their first legislative elections. The People First Party (PFP) won
46 seats and the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU), with former KMT
Chairman and ex-ROC President Lee Teng-hui as its "spiritual leader,"
got 13, with the remaining seats won by independents and fringe
parties.</P>
      <P>After learning of the DPP's emergence as the biggest party in the
legislature, Premier Chang Chun-hsiung said the victory is a clear
indication that the electorate agrees with Chen's proposal for the
establishment of a "national stabilization alliance" and for the
enhancement of inter-party cooperation.</P>
      <P>"The proposal reflects the mainstream values of our society,"
Chang said, promising to carry it out as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The DPP garnered 36.57 percent of total votes cast in the
legislative elections, compared to the KMT's 31.28 percent, the PFP's
20.34 percent, the TSU's 8.5 percent and the New Party's 2.86
percent. The average voter turnout in the legislative polls was 66.16
percent.</P>
      <P>The pro-unification New Party won just one seat in the new
legislature, down from the nine it held prior to the election. The
party failed to win the minimum 5 percent of the vote it needed to
qualify for proportional representation seats. It also managed to win
only one local government position -- the magistrateship of the
frontline island of Kinmen, which lies closer to mainland China than
to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>New Party convener Hsieh Chi-ta, an incumbent legislator who lost
her re-election bid, said the party will not fade away, but will
"continue to flourish."</P>
      <P>Noting that many of incumbent New Party legislators have topped
the best-performing lawmakers list, she lamented that "their defeats
were great losses to the nation."</P>
      <P>Both Lee and TSU Chairman Huang Chu-wen said they were satisfied
with the party's showing in the polls. "The results also show that
the TSU did not win seats at the DPP's expense," said Huang.</P>
      <P>He further said the outcome indicates that the New Party's "one
country, two systems" unification advocacy and the KMT's insistence
on the existence of the "1992 consensus" (one China, with each side
free to interpret the notion as they see fit) do not enjoy popular
support.</P>
      <P>Huang, a former KMT member, predicted that the KMT will suffer
another split in the wake of the elections.</P>
      <P>KMT Chairman Lien Chan conceded the party's poor showing in the
legislative polls. He said as the KMT remains the largest opposition
party, it will do its utmost to help maintain domestic political
stability and promote inter-party cooperation after the elections.</P>
      <P>PFP Chairman James Soong said he was satisfied with the party's
showing. Soong, who lost his presidential bid last year by a narrow
margin, said he has no interest in joining any political alliances
but stressed that the PFP will endeavor to be a dutiful, responsible
opposition party.</P>
      <P>In the local elections that also took place Saturday, the KMT
managed to win mayorships and magistrateships in six previously
DPP-ruled cities and counties -- Taichung City, Keelung City,
Taichung County, Taoyuan County, Hsinchu City and Hsinchu County.</P>
      <P>The DPP also won nine local government chief posts, while the PFP
won in Taitung County and the outlying Lienchiang County, which
covers the island of Matsu and lies closer to the mainland than to
Taiwan. (By sofia Wu) (To be continued)</P>

      <P>Analysts said that mainland China viewed Chen to be a weak,
bungling president who wouldn't be re-elected and could be ignored.
But his party's victory Saturday might convince Beijing that Chen
could win another term. By continuing to ignore him, Chinese leaders
could cause Taiwan to drift further toward independence.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BUSINESS LEADER CALLS FOR NEW LEGISLATURE TO WORK TOGETHER AS A TEAM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  3  (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The chairman of the General Chamber of
Commerce, Republic of China, on Monday called on the new Legislature
to fulfill its role of supervising the administration to ensure the
implementation of the resolutions adopted at the Economic Development
Advisory Conference in late August.</P>
      <P>Wang Ling-lin, who served as a legislator in the ROC's most
recent Legislature, did not seek reelection in the Dec. 1 elections.</P>
      <P>Wang, also chairman of the Eastern Multimedia Group and vice
chairman of the Rebar Group, said that he expects the newly elected
legislators to work as a team no matter which party they belong to
and no matter what doctrines they believe in.</P>
      <P>The new Legislature should push the administration to implement
the economic revitalization programs mapped out with the consensus of
all the parties who attended the August conference, he added.</P>
      <P>The changing of the nation's political map after the elections
reflects the development of a society of multiple values, according
to Wang.</P>
      <P>He said that the voters' excessive zealousness regarding party
politics instigated by election campaigns over the past several
months needs to be soothed, adding that those in business circles
always believe that prosperity comes from accommodation and
tolerance.</P>
      <P>The business leader pointed out the importance of cross-Taiwan
Strait economic and trade cooperation, noting that mainland China
poses a serious threat to Taiwan but also offers tremendous
opportunities.</P>
      <P>He said that Taiwan's manufacturing industries cannot afford to
ignore mainland China as one of the world's largest production bases
and one of the fastest growing markets. He noted that business people
from Taiwan can help upgrade the industrial structure on the
mainland.</P>
      <P>With so many new faces elected, Wang said, he is very concerned
about the new Legislature's lawmaking efficiency and the
applicability of the new laws it passes related to economics and
commerce.</P>
      <P>Not many in the new Legislature have experience in business
management or are familiar with the operations of the Legislative
Yuan, he said, suggesting that the new legislators recruit experts
from industry and from academic circles to act as advisers.</P>
      <P>As the production value of service industries already accounts
for two thirds of Taiwan's gross domestic product, Wang said that the
new Legislature should make a thorough review of the government's tax
regulations and seek to improve Taiwan's investment environment.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan was able to create an economic miracle over
the past several decades because of the efforts of many men with
vision, Wang said the new Legislature should encourage the
administration to explore new possibilities for Taiwan's economy with
an open mind.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT CHAIRMAN URGED TO STAY ON DESPITE SETBACK</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  3  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Two popular figures within the opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) said Monday that party chairman Lien Chan need not
step down to take the responsibility for the KMT's setback in the
elections over the weekend.</P>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou noted that during Saturday's
legislative as well as local city and county chief elections, the KMT
garnered more votes nationally than it did in last year's
presidential election, in which Lien Chan represented the KMT and
finished a distant third in the race.</P>
      <P>The KMT also now controls nine cities and counties around Taiwan,
one more than before the elections, Ma noted, adding that this was
"not an easy task" to accomplish.</P>
      <P>Moreover, although Wang Chien-shien, who in the Taipei county
magistrate election represented the "pan-blue alliance," a grouping
of the KMT and its two splinter parties the People First Party (PFP)
and the New Party (NP), lost to the incumbent Su Tseng-chang, Wang
managed to garner 820,000 votes, or the highest number of votes of
any KMT candidate running for the position in the past 12 years.</P>
      <P>Ma said that although the KMT slipped to 68 seats in the 225-seat
Legislature while the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
increased its share of seats to 87, Lien should not resign from his
post.</P>
      <P>He added however that the KMT needs to review the results of the
elections, including the party's campaign strategy and contingency
plans.</P>
      <P>Ma also said that inter-party cooperation is crucial, noting that
cooperation between the KMT and PFP should be a basic direction and
should receive the "full-hearted devotion" of both sides as the
future of either party will not be optimistic if they decide to fight
single-handedly.</P>
      <P>He added however that the mechanism for such cooperation,
consultation and crisis management should be carefully planned so
that there will not be any misunderstandings between the top brass of
the two parties.</P>
      <P>Jason Hu, the KMT's candidate who won the Taichung mayorship,
echoed Ma's words by saying that an immediate resignation by Lien
would not help the party's stability.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Wang Chien-shien, the KMT's candidate for Taipei
County chief who was defeated, called on Lien Monday. He said after
the meeting that although the KMT lost its position as the largest
party in the Legislature, he hopes that both the KMT and the PFP will
make some concessions and engage in sincere cooperation.</P>
      <P>Lauding Lien as "tolerant and big-hearted," Wang said he hopes
Lien can tide over the present difficulties and that the KMT members
can rally behind him.</P>
      <P>Wang, who became one of the founding members of the New Party
eight years ago after leaving the KMT, said that as a former KMT
member for 36 years and as one of the "pan-blue alliance," he is
concerned with the future of the KMT and its impact on the fate of
the nation.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PFP CHAIRMAN SEES NO NEED TO FORM 'STABILIZATION ALLIANCE'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taitung, Taiwan, Dec. 3 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition People First Party (PFP)
Chairman James Soong urged President Chen Shui-bian Monday to
organize a new government in step with the new public opinion as
reflected in the results of Saturday's legislative elections.</P>
      <P>"Now that Chen's Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has emerged
as the largest party in the legislature, the president has obtained
the mandate to organize a new government," Soong said during a
"thanksgiving" trip to the eastern county of Taitung where PFP
candidate Hsu Ching-yuan was elected magistrate.</P>
      <P>Both the ruling DPP and Soong's PFP were clear winners of the
just-concluded legislative polls in which the DPP garnered 87 seats,
up from its current 67 in the 225-member Legislative Yuan, and the
PFP more than doubled its seats to 46.</P>
      <P>The DPP and its ally -- the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) which
gained 13 legislative seats -- can jointly control 100 legislative
seats, only 13 shy of a parliamentary majority.</P>
      <P>"Given this situation, President Chen's proposal to form a
'national stabilization alliance' has become meaningless," Soong
said, adding that Chen had better scrap his plan and return to
operating within the framework of the country's Constitution.</P>
      <P>As the DPP controls barely one-third of seats in the outgoing
legislature, Chen's minority administration has been plagued by
parliamentary gridlock and bickering since Chen's inauguration in May
2000. In an attempt to end legislative bickering, Chen had promised
to organize a broad-based, cross-party legislative alliance after the
elections to pave the way for forming the island's first coalition
government.</P>
      <P>In Soong's view, the proposed alliance, would be an "outlawed"
body which could disrupt or hinder normal government operations under
constitutional provisions.</P>
      <P>Soong said the PFP has no intention of joining the alliance. "Nor
is the party interested in participating in any ruling coalition," he
said, adding that the PFP will consistently act as an opposition
party and make sure the government is kept within "checks and
balances."</P>
      <P>"We are determined to be a top-notch, responsible opposition
party," Soong stressed. "The PFP will faithfully reflect mainstream
public opinion and carry out the mission of 'checks and balances'
with reason."</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, Soong said, the PFP will also not seek the
speaker and deputy speaker posts of the new legislature.</P>
      <P>Noting that the latest electoral results have strengthened
President Chen's ruling mandate, Soong said everybody should accept
this outcome regardless of whether they like it or not.</P>
      <P>Soong also advised former President Lee Teng-hui not to try to
use the TSU's political clout to meddle in domestic political
operations.</P>
      <P>Lee, the TSU's spiritual leader, had campaigned hard for TSU
candidates in the run-up to the weekend elections. Speaking on the
campaign trail, Lee said he had helped push for the TSU's
establishment mainly because he hoped to help end the legislative
gridlock and bickering.</P>
      <P>With the TSU's better-than-expected showing in its first
electoral battle, political analysts said Lee may emerge as a key
player in the DPP's efforts to build a post-election coalition
government.</P>
      <P>Soong urged Lee to refrain from trying to "manipulate" or
"dominate" government operations. "Lee should shy from stealing the
show and should leave President Chen alone to make a decision," he
said. "A bridegroom is a bridegroom, and a best man is best man. Lee
should not misjudge the situation."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Finance Yen Ching-chang said
Monday that the outcome of the Dec. 1 elections will ensure a
stabilizing force for the administration to implement its policies,
which is beneficial to the stock as well as foreign exchange markets.</P>
      <P>The Taipei Stock Exchange market was bullish Monday, the first
trading day after the elections of legislators and city and county
chiefs. Share prices jumped 4.6 percent, with the weighted price
index gaining 205.49 points to close at 4,646.61 points.</P>
      <P>Yen pointed out that the sluggishness of the local economy was
mainly due to the international economic recession. As an
export-oriented economy, Taiwan was vulnerable to an international
economic slowdown, he added.</P>
      <P>The minister said that Taiwan's economic prospects were looking
up as the international economic environment was improving. Many
finance ministers he met at the Asian-Pacific Economic Conference in
September suggested that Taiwan will be among the first group of
economies to rebound.</P>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party won 87 seats in the
elections for legislators, attaining the position as the largest
party in the Legislative Yuan. The opposition Kuomintang won 68

    <HEADLINE>POLL FINDS MAJORITY SUPPORT FOR COALITION GOVERNMENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Dec.   3   (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The majority of respondents to a
post-elections opinion survey have voiced support for the formation
of a coalition government to maintain domestic political stability,
pollsters said Monday.</P>
      <P>The telephone poll of 1,090 adults randomly chosen from around
the island, conducted by Gallup opinion survey company at the request
of Sanlih Entertainment Television, found that 60.5 percent of those
interviewed supported the formation of a coalition government.</P>
      <P>Only 21.9 percent gave a thumbs-down to the proposal with the
remaining respondents declining to answer the question.</P>
      <P>Even though the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) managed
to garner the largest number of seats in the re-elected legislature
in Saturday's polls, it still failed to control a clear majority. The
DPP gained 87 out of the 225 legislative seats up for grabs. Before
the elections, President Chen Shui-bian had promised to organized a
broad-based, cross-party alliance in the new legislature to pave the
way for the formation of the island's first coalition government
after the polls.</P>
      <P>As the electoral outcome broke the once all-powerful Kuomintang's
(KMT's) grip on the legislative majority, whether incumbent
Legislative Yuan Wang Jin-pyng, a KMT vice chairman, can continue
serving as speaker of the lawmaking body has also drawn much
attention. The KMT won only 68 seats in the latest elections, down
from the current 110.</P>
      <P>Gallup survey results showed that 27.9 percent of the respondents
supported a DPP-KMT ticket for the legislature's speaker-deputy
speaker election scheduled for next February.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 17.9 percent said they preferred to see the KMT team
up with the opposition People First Party (PFP), which gained 46
seats in Saturday's elections, to vie for the speakership and deputy
speakership.</P>
      <P>While 9.9 percent said they hoped to see a DPP-DPP ticket, 7.9
percent backed a DPP-PFP slate, and 5.5 percent backed a KMT-KMT
ticket. Another 5.5 percent said they would like to see the DPP team
up with the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) for the two top legislative
posts, and 23.1 percent had no opinion. The four-month-old
TSU capture 13 seats in the just-concluded elections.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT BEGINS SOUL-SEARCHING AFTER ELECTION SETBACK</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  3  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) began
soul-searching Monday with its chairman, Lien Chan, saying that the
party will review its operations after election setbacks over the
weekend.</P>
      <P>Lien made the remarks in a closed-door meeting with nine elected
KMT mayors and county magistrates, according to Chao Shou-po,
director general of the KMT's organization and development committee.</P>
      <P>The KMT was dealt a serious blow in the legislative elections by
collecting only 68 seats in the 225-seat Legislative Yuan compared
with the sharp increase of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) which took 87 seats. However, the KMT found some solace by
taking nine city and county chiefs positions, one more than before
the elections. The DPP dropped to nine from 12 before the elections.</P>
      <P>Lien urged the KMT members to continue to work hard, and said
that he will review party operations and adopt necessary measures. He
also comforted those defeated KMT candidates, especially those who
lost by a small margin such as Yeh Chin-feng in Chunghua County.</P>
      <P>Lien told the elected officials that the current economic
situation is not good, and each of the local chiefs should expect to
face painful financial problems. He expressed the hope that they work
closely with the KMT caucus in the legislature, and Legislative Yuan
President Wang Jin-pyng, who is also a KMT vice chairman, to set the
nation's economy on a new course.</P>
      <P>Lien said that the results of the local elections show that the
people want to give the KMT another chance, and the KMT will make
good use of the opportunity to listen to the real voice of grassroots
citizens.</P>
      <P>He noted that every city and county will face debt and interest
repayment problems. In addition, construction after the Sept. 21,
1999 earthquake and the impact on trade by Taiwan's imminent entry
into the World Trade Organization will also be issues the local
chiefs will face.</P>
      <P>Some of the elected city and county chief said the KMT's think
tanks will be able to help them with ideas to improve social order,
traffic, social welfare, construction, disaster prevention and
globalization.</P>
      <P>Some said that the public is most concerned about social order,
unemployment and economic problems, and programs to deal with WTO
entry.</P>
      <P>Some also said that there should be more exchanges between the
local KMT chiefs, and that Penghu Magistrate-elect Lai Feng-wei will
organize regular, unofficial meetings.</P>
      <P>KMT Vice Chairmen Wu Po-hsiung, Lin Cheng-chih, and Wang
Jin-pyng all concurred that this is the time for KMT unity, urging
all party members to rally behind the party despite the setbacks.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN ECONOMISTS UPBEAT ON ECONOMIC GROWTH FOR 2002</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 3 (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Economists at the Academia Sinica predicted
Monday that Taiwan's first-quarter economic growth next year should
be able to reach approximately 2 percent as seen from several
favorable indicators signaling possible recovery.</P>
      <P>Researchers at the Academia Sinica Institute of Economics said
that the stock market is one of the most sensitive indicators of
economic revival. Export orders for the local electronic industry
have also seen an obvious increase recently, they said, adding that
production equipment will kick back into action as warehouse
stockpiles are gradually depleted.</P>
      <P>The economists said that because the fourth-quarter economic
growth rate last year was only 3.82 percent, the basis for comparison
for this year's fourth-quarter economic growth was already relatively
low. Therefore, this year's fourth-quarter economic growth could
reach negative 1 percent compared to the same period last year
instead of the government-estimated negative 2.68 percent, they said.</P>
      <P>The institute -- which is scheduled to announce its economic
growth forecast for 2002 on Dec. 19 -- predicted that the economy's
upswing momentum should carry into next year, with first-quarter
economic growth reaching approximately 2 percent compared to the same
period this year, when the economy grew by only 0.92 percent.</P>
      <P>The economy could still reach the government-established goal of
2.6 percent annual economic growth in 2002, the institute added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Taiwan Research Institute (TRI), a local think
tank affiliated with former President Lee Teng-hui, announced in its
2002 economic forecast report that the island's average economic
growth for the latter half of next year will reach 3.97 percent,
while annual growth should reach 2.24 percent.</P>
      <P>The TRI predicted that Taiwan's annual economic growth for this
year could fall to negative 2.18 percent as global economic growth
would reach only 1.3 percent due to the bursting of the U.S.
information technology bubble and fallout from the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks on America.</P>
      <P>However, the global economic growth rate could reach 1.7 percent
next year, the TRI predicted.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP  VICTORY  MAY  FORCE  BEIJING TO RETHINK TAIWAN POLICY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Beijing,  Dec.  3  (CNA)
(By Tseng Chun-liang and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China is expected to adjust its
strategy toward Taiwan after the people of Taiwan gave their
government a vote of confidence Saturday, political analysts said
Monday.</P>
      <P>Since President Chen Shui-bian assumed the Republic of China
presidency in Taiwan's first-ever peaceful transition of power
between different political parties in May 2000, mainland China has
been promoting an "anti-independence, pro-unification" campaign in
Taiwan and even to overseas Chinese communities around the world.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Beijing has declined any contact or dialogue with
Chen's administration on suspicion of what it saw as the
pro-independence nature of his Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>As Chen won the presidency with only 39.3 percent of the popular
vote and the pro-unification Kuomintang (KMT) still controlled a
clear majority in Taiwan's legislature, leaders in Beijing regarded
Chen as a "minority president" with little chance of winning
re-election.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, mainland China adopted a new policy toward
Taiwan -- forging contacts with only those Taiwan political parties
or groups which support the "one China" principle and intensifying
its diplomatic embargo against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In the run-up to Taiwan's Dec. 1 legislative elections, mainland
leaders generally forecast a poor showing for Chen's DPP as his
administration has been plagued by legislative gridlock and the
island's economy is in its worst downturn in three decades.</P>
      <P>Much to Beijing's surprise, the electoral results showed that the
DPP replaced the KMT as the largest party in the re-elected lawmaking
body. The DPP captured 87 of the 225 legislative seats up for grabs,
and the newly formed Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU), which campaigned
on a platform of "stressing Taiwan's separate identity and keeping
mainland China at arm's length," won 13 seats.</P>
      <P>In contrast, the KMT won only 68 seats, down from 110 before the
elections.</P>
      <P>Mainland Chinese scholars involved in study of Taiwan affairs
generally admitted that the electoral outcome is favorable to Chen's
administration and would boost the island's pro-independence
sentiments and may even enhance Chen's confidence in seeking
re-election. As for the impact on relations across the Taiwan Strait,
most mainland academics painted a pessimistic picture.</P>
      <P>Li Jiachuan, a researcher with the Beijing-based Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Strait, said that most candidates who
supported the "one China" principle, the existence of the
cross-strait "1992 consensus" on "one China, separate
interpretations," and opposed Taiwan independence were defeated in
Saturday's polls.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, Li said, those who pitched for Taiwan's
"localization," separate identity and disavowal of the "1992
consensus" won their electoral bids.</P>
      <P>"This outcome will have an adverse impact on the future
development of cross-strait ties," Li said.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, some other analysts, who preferred anonymity, said
even though mainland China is unlikely to change its fundamental
attitude toward Chen's administration, it cannot completely ignore
the island's political reality.</P>
      <P>If Beijing continues rejecting any engagement with Chen's
administration, the analysts said, the situation may get worse.</P>
      <P>Beijing's recalcitrant attitude and inaction could block any
chance of improving cross-strait relations and could make Taiwan
drift further away from the mainland, they warned.</P>
      <P>The analysts further said Beijing leaders should draw inspiration
from the results of Taiwan's latest elections and should understand
that their "one country, two systems" unification scheme has no
appeal to Taiwan voters.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Monday his
party's dramatic win in Saturday's legislative elections would not
change his commitment to improving relations across the Taiwan
Strait.</P>
      <P>While meeting with more than 20 foreign scholars and experts
attending a seminar on Taiwan's democratic consolidation and peace
in the Taiwan Strait, Chen said his administration's policy of
opening up to mainland China would not be revered after the weekend
polls in which his Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) replaced the
Kuomintang (KMT) as the biggest party in the new legislature.</P>
      <P>"My sincerity to improve cross-strait relations has not changed.
My wish to normalize cross-strait relations has not changed," Chen
told his guests.</P>
      <P>Chen said mainland Chinese authorities looked down on him and
 his administration before the elections.</P>
      <P>"I hope they can respect the choice of the people of Taiwan after
the elections" Chen said, adding that he also hopes that
mainland leaders can "grasp the window of opportunity" by ending
the stalemate between the two sides.</P>
      <P>Noting that the Dec. 1 polls were the island's cleanest
elections, Chen said the electoral results further consolidated
Taiwan's democratic achievements and marked further progress in the
island's democratic development.</P>
      <P>Chen said he hopes Taiwan's democratization can serve a beacon
to mainland China's modernization and democratization.</P>
      <P>Mainland China has cold-shouldered Chen since his presidential
election victory last year, even though he has mellowed his
pro-independence stand and made numerous conciliatory gestures to
Beijing.</P>
      <P>Chen's DPP captured 87 seats in an unexpected election rout, up
from 67 in the outgoing KMT-dominated legislature. The once
all-powerful KMT gained only 68 out of the 225 seats up for grabs,
losing its parliamentary majority for the first time in their last
bastion of power.</P>
      <P>Chen told foreign election observers that he will uphold his
pre-election commitment to organize a broadbased, cross-party
"national stabilization alliance" in the legislature to pave the
way for the formation of the island's first coalition government
after the polls.</P>
      <P>Chen said he has asked DPP Chairman Frank Hsieh and
other party heavyweights to stop any criticism of opposition
parties as the end of the elections should be the beginning of
inter-party cooperation.</P>
      <P>"The electoral outcome indicates that local voters have high
expectation of domestic political stability," Chen said, adding that
both his administration and the DPP are obliged to deliver on
their campaign promises of pursuing sweeping domestic reform in a
stable environment as well as revitalizing the island's faltering
economy.</P>

      <P>Tsai made the remarks at a seminar with the heads of Taiwan

    <HEADLINE>ROC GOV'T TO SET UP MECHANISM TO DEAL WITH INTERNATIONAL RELIEF WORK</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  4  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) is
planning to establish a mechanism to deal with Taiwan's humanitarian
relief work in the international community, a MOFA official said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Lo Chih-cheng, the head of MOFA's Research and Planning Board,
noted that with various disasters and accidents taking place in
recent years, Taiwan has increased its participation in international
relief work, adding that Taiwan's current contingency measures to
deal with such accidents have proved to be inadequate.</P>
      <P>The ministry has therefore drafted a plan to establish the
mechanism, Lo said, adding that such a mechanism will help upgrade
the efficiency of Taiwan's international relief work as well as
highlight the government's determination in the pursuit of peace.</P>
      <P>Also, as human rights diplomacy is a major part of Taiwan's
current foreign policy, Lo said, the ministry has instructed its
overseas missions to actively participate in activities related to
International Human Rights Day on Dec. 10.</P>
      <P>He added that position papers on Taiwan's human rights diplomacy
will be unveiled in a few days.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SCHOOL FOR TAIWAN CHILDREN ON M'LAND TO OFFER 12-YEAR EDUCATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  4 (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Education has approved the
opening of two classes for 10th grade students by the Dongguan School
for Taiwan Businessperson's Children in Guangdong Province, mainland
China, beginning in the 2002 school year, a ministry official said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The Dongguan school, set up in September 2000, is the first shool
for Taiwan children in mainland China. The school presently has four
kindergarten classes, 20 elementary school classes, and seven junior
high school classes, but it offers no high school class.</P>
      <P>Currently, there are 96 children in the kindergarten classes, 646
students in the elementary school classes, and 243 in the junior high
school classes, according to Wu Canyang, the school principle.</P>
      <P>Wu said that among the school's 29 junior high school graduates
last summer, 13 returned to Taiwan to continue their education, while
the others either chose to enter a mainland Chinese high school or
went to Singapore to attend high school.</P>
      <P>Junior high school graduates of this school year will now be able
to continue their education in high school classes at the Dongguan
school with the opening of the two 10th grade classes in September
2002, he said.</P>
      <P>It is expected that the Dongguan school for children of Taiwan
businesspeople will admit three classes of new high school students
each year, according to Wu.</P>
      <P>He said that the school in the first semester enrolled more than
700 students, much higher than the 500 that the school initially
planned to receive. As the number of students who will be attending
the school by the year 2005 may exceed 2,000, new classrooms and
school facilities are presently under construction.</P>
      <P>Subsidized by the Ministry of Education, the Dongguan school
offers courses comparable to those offered in Taiwan's education
system. Since the teachers and the teaching materials are mostly from
Taiwan, the graduates of the Dongguan school will not have much
trouble continuing their studies in Taiwan, Wu pointed out.</P>
      <P>Taiwan children in the Dongguan area are lucky to have such an
educational establishment, mainly because of the efforts of the large
numbers of Taiwan businesspeople working there.</P>
      <P>The chairman of the school board, Yeh Hung-teng, is the former
chairman of the Taiwan Businessperson's Association, Dongguan. Since
the time it was formed in October 1993, the 2,169-member association
had made the school project a major goal.</P>
      <P>In order to successfully establish this kind of "private" school,
the association needed the support of authorities on both sides of
the Taiwan Strait. After years of negotiations, the school
preparatory committee received the approval of the Guangdong
Provincial Government in October 1999 to establish a school with the
status similar to that of an international school.</P>
      <P>The Dongguan school is unique in mainland China because it is
allowed to have a Taiwan principal, hire Taiwan teachers and use
textbooks from Taiwan.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 4 (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung said Tuesday that
his Cabinet will resign en masse sometime in January before the next
Legislative Yuan is sworn in.</P>
      <P>Chang made the remark while being interpellated by opposition
Kuomintang Legislator Lin Jih-jia. However, he said that the exact
date for the resignation was still under consideration.</P>
      <P>In response to Lin's comment that several outstanding legislators
were not re-elected partially because pre-election opinion polls led
their supporters to believe that the popular candidates would have no
problem winning the elections, Chang said that he agreed with Lin
"100 percent" and that a draft amendment to the Public Officials
Election and Recall Law to help create a fairer and more objective
election environment in the future has already been sent to the
Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>After the interpellation session, Chang told reporters that
because the premier is appointed by the president, it is too early to
talk about forming a new Cabinet.</P>
      <P>The pressing issue at hand is ratifying the fiscal 2002 general
budget for the central government, he added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The first batch of three single-engine
utility aircraft produced by Tiger Aircraft, a Taiwan-U.S. joint
venture company, rolled off the assembly line and took flight at a
grand ceremony in West Virginia Monday.</P>
      <P>Republic of China Vice Minister of Economic Affairs Yiin
Chii-ming, West Virginia Gov. Bob Wise, U.S. Sen. John D. Rockefeller
from West Virginia, U.S. Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association
President Phil Boyer and some 300 guests were present at the event.</P>
      <P>With representatives from 11 Taiwan aviation companies in tow,
Yiin said that these companies were able to vie for the opportunity
to produce spare parts for the US$219,500 four-person plane and learn
about the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) aircraft
certification process through the joint venture.</P>
      <P>The company, which is 70 percent-owned by Taiwan venture capital
firms, received the FAA certification for the Tiger AG-5B last
Friday.</P>
      <P>Tiger Aircraft Chairman and CEO Bob Crowley turned the keys
of the first three planes over to their respective U.S. buyers at the
ceremony. The company already has orders for 48 more planes and
estimates it will receive orders for 96 planes next year.</P>
      <P>David R.C. Chu, director of the ROC Executive Yuan's Committee
for Aviation and Space Industry Development, said that U.S. aviation
companies have been seeking production bases in Asia ever since the
Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in America further exasperated the
sluggish business at U.S. airlines and sent the U.S. civil aviation
industry into a tailspin.</P>
      <P>This has led to the opening up of opportunities for Taiwan
aviation firms, and initial negotiations with Tiger Aircraft suggest
that the company could decide to manufacture fuselage and tail
components in Taiwan, Chu added.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Dec.   4   (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government will give priority
consideration to mainland Chinese citizens who have resident status
in Hong Kong or Macau regarding entering Taiwan for tourism, the
nation's top formulator of mainland policy said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Tsai Eng-wen, chairwoman of the Mainland Affairs Council, made
the remarks while fielding questions in the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Legislator Kwan Yuk-noan of the opposition Kuomintang suggested
during the general intepellation session in the Legislative Yuan that
the government at the start of next year open Taiwan simultaneously
to mainland Chinese tourists residing in Macau and Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>Kwan was referring to the government's recent decision to open
Taiwan as of Jan.1 , 2002, to mainland Chinese tourists who have
permanent resident status in other countries or who are studying
overseas.</P>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung noted that the Economic Development
Advisory Conference in August concurred that Taiwan should open up to
mainland Chinese tourists and expressed the hope that the two sides
of the Taiwan Strait will first consult with each other on the issue.</P>
      <P>But the premier said that as cross-strait consultations are
currently stalled, the Republic of China government has had to resort
to the partial opening measure instead.</P>
      <P>Tsai said that the number of mainland Chinese coming to Taiwan
for tourism, meaning those who have permanent residency in a third
country or are students studying overseas, will not be as small as
others have claimed.</P>
      <P>She added that the opening of Taiwan to mainland Chinese tourists
will be a positive thing and that there is no need for foot-dragging.</P>
      <P>The MAC chairwoman also said that the future scope of Taiwan's
opening to mainland Chinese tourists as well as the question of when
to implement the next stage of the opening will depend on the results
of the first stage of the opening and also on the level of matching
measures by mainland China.</P>
      <P>She said that those mainland Chinese who have obtained resident
status in Hong Kong or Macau will continue to be given priority
consideration when the ROC government plans for the next stage of the
Taiwan's opening to mainland Chinese tourists.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NUMBER OF BLACK-FACED SPOON-BILLS ARRIVING IN TAIWAN TOPS 600</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  4  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The number of black-faced spoonbills that
have arrived in Taiwan for the winter has reached more than 600, a
black-faced spoonbill preservation society in the southern Taiwan
county of Tainan said.</P>
      <P>But the society said that as most of the black-faced spoonbills
are only using Taiwan as a mid-way stop, the maximum number of the
migratory birds staying at the mouth of Tsengwen Creek, a major
habitat in Tainan County for the endangered species, has remained at
526.</P>
      <P>The society said that although it detects that the number of
black-faced spoon-bills in the area has surpassed 600, the bird is
migratory in nature and does not stay in the same place for long, so
the society has been hesitant about publicly announcing a new record
number.</P>
      <P>The society said it will conduct a survey of the black-faced
spoon-bill simultaneously with its Hong Kong counterparts, just as it
did last year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>COL. PAN AI-CHU TO BECOME ROC'S 3RD FEMALE GENERAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  4 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Col. Pan Ai-chu, the new political warfare
department director of the Military Intelligence Bureau (MIB) under
the Ministry of National Defense (MND), will be promoted to the rank
of major general Jan. 1, 2002, an MND spokesman said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Military spokesman Maj. Gen. Huang Suey-sheng told a routine news
conference that Pan was promoted to her current post from deputy
director of the MIB's mainland Chinese affairs research department
Dec. 1.</P>
      <P>"As the post is traditionally reserved for a major general, Pan
will be promoted to that rank at the beginning of next year," Huang
explained.</P>
      <P>Pan, 46, will be the first Republic of China female officer to be
promoted to major general in more than 40 years. And in the country's
military history, she will become the third female general.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, Pan said it will be a great honor
for her to join the ranks of generals.</P>
      <P>"The promotion will be yet another symbol of gender equality in
the ROC armed forces," Pan said, adding that it also signifies the
bright career prospects for women military officers in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Pan encouraged her fellows in the military to forget their sex in
their workplaces and compete with their male peers on an equal
footing. As a matter of fact, she said, the military has put much
emphasis on gender equality in recent years.</P>
      <P>"I feel that female officers and non-commissioned officers can
have brilliant careers just like their male fellows so long as they
work hard," Pan said.</P>
      <P>Military records show that Pan graduated from the political
science department of the military-run Fuhsingkang College and has a
master's degree from the school's Graduate Institute of Political
Science. Pan has also attended an MIB-sponsored graduate program.</P>
      <P>Pan was an outstanding student and ranked among the top three
when she graduated from Fuhsingkang College. She worked for two years
at the ROC Army's local-level political warfare units and then
entered the graduate school. She joined the MIB's mainland affairs
research department after obtaining her master's degree.</P>
      <P>Over the past 20-plus years, Pan has been involved in research of
mainland Chinese intelligence and relevant information. She is now
responsible for studying articles carried in major mainland Chinese
magazines as well as collecting, compiling and analyzing information
about the latest mainland situation.</P>
      <P>Pan has received much acclaim from the government and military
leadership for her analyses of mainland intelligence and suggestions
on the development of relations across the Taiwan Strait, military
sources said.</P>
      <P>According to MIB sources, Pan's analytical reports were very
useful during three critical periods -- the 1996 Taiwan Strait
crisis, former President Lee Teng-hui's defining of cross-strait ties
as a special "state-to-state" relationship in July 1999, and the 2000
presidential election which ushered in Taiwan's first peaceful
transition of power between different political parties.</P>
      <P>Commenting on reports that Chief of the General Staff Gen. Tang
Yao-ming asked her to promote the MIB's restructuring after she
assumed her current post, Pan said job adjustments in the MIB have
never been based on any specific topics or problems.</P>
      <P>"Superiors tend to make an overall, comprehensive review before
making personnel adjustments, and personal qualifications or
capabilities are also a major consideration," Pan said.</P>
      <P>Noting that security is the priority concern in intelligence
work, Pan said she will focus on improving security measures and
helping her superiors make the right judgment calls in the
policymaking process.</P>
      <P>Pan's husband is also a career service member. They have two
sons, both of whom now senior high school students. Pan said it has
not been difficult for her to balance her military career and her
family life.</P>
      <P>The ROC's first women general was Chiang Yi-ying, a close aide to
Gen. Tai Li, director of the MIB's precursor, known as the
"chun-tung-chu" in Chinese. Chiang impressed her superiors with
remarkable accomplishments in developing clandestine radio stations
for intelligence delivery in Hong Kong and Southeast Asia during the
eight-year War of Resistance against Japanese Aggression. After
retiring from intelligence service, Chiang dedicated herself to the
service of education, founding Yusheng Elementary School in Taipei.</P>
      <P>The second women general was Maj. Gen. Chou Mei-yu, a military
medical member who contributed a great deal to the establishment of
the National Defense Medical College. Chou was promoted to major
general in 1958 and retired from military service in 1972.</P>

      <P>Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou said Tuesday that
there is no need for Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan to step down
to take responsibility for the party's upset in the Dec. 1
legislative and local elections.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks while commenting on the call by some KMT
members that Lien should resign.</P>
      <P>Ma, a member of the KMT Central Standing Committee, told the
media that "all of us are responsible for the defeat in the
elections, but we have different ways to take the responsibility."</P>
      <P>He said that Lien should continue serving as party chairman and
find the reasons for the defeat to carry out a thorough party
reforms.</P>
      <P>Ma went on to say that the primary responsibility for Lien is how
to bring back the party's members who left the party when
then-president Lee Teng-hui served as party chairman.</P>
      <P>"It will best benefit the party," he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.S. THINK TANK SPONSORS SEMINAR ON IMPACT OF TAIWAN ELECTIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,   Dec.   3  (CNA)
(By Jay Chen and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Representatives of major Taiwan
political parties debated the possible fallout of the island's
latest legislative elections on future development of relations
across the Taiwan Strait at a seminar here Monday.</P>
      <P>Hsiao Bi-khim, one of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's
(DPP's) newly elected legislator representing the overseas
Chinese community, said at the seminar that President Chen Shui-bian
will continue his "middle-of-the-road" policy on cross-strait affairs
after the DPP emerged as the largest party in Taiwan's legislature.</P>
      <P>However, Su Chi, a former chairman of the Republic of china's
Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council who represented Taiwan's
largest opposition party, the Kuomintang (KMT), at the seminar, said
he is pessimistic about future cross-strait ties.</P>
      <P>In an unexpected election rout, the DPP managed to capture 87
out of the 225 legislative seats up for grabs in Saturday's
elections, up from current 67. In contrast, the KMT lost its 52-year
parliamentary dominance by garnering only 68 seats.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the seminar sponsored by the American Enterprise
Institute (AEI), Wu Jui-kuo, representative of Taiwan's another
major opposition party, the People First Party (PFP), which more
than doubled its seats to 46, said his party looks forward to see
all of the island's major political groups forge a consensus on the
development of cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>Wu said President Chen should convene a meeting of the National
Unification Council (NUC) to work out an innovative strategy to
break the lingering cross-strait impasse.</P>
      <P>If necessary, Wu said, the PFP does not oppose a change of the
NUC's name so that it can become a body acceptable to all major
Taiwan political parties or forces for forging a national consensus
on relations with mainland China.</P>
      <P>The trio arrived in Washington, D.C. Monday to attend the AEI
seminar which attracted the attendance of more than 100 scholars and
experts on China and Taiwan affairs.</P>
      <P>Su said one of the major reasons contributing to the KMT's
stunning election defeat was that the party has consistently adopted
a moderate approach toward nearly all important policy issues,
including cross-strait ties and ethnicity problems.</P>
      <P>As a result, Su said, the KMT's support base has been weakened in
Taiwan's increasingly polarized society.</P>
      <P>Worse still, Su said, the KMT committed some tactical errors,
including fielding too many candidates and slow progress in
intraparty reforms.</P>
      <P>Su said the division between northern and southern parts of the
island, among different ethnic groups and between pro-independence
and pro-unification activists has become even more serious after the
elections.</P>
      <P>"I'm worried that mainland China would become more ssuspicious of
Taiwan's true stance on cross-strait relations now that President
Chen has strengthened his political mandate through the weekend
polls," Su said.</P>
      <P>He also criticized the DPP government's inaction and inability to
thaw stalled cross-strait ties. Su said it was regrettable that
President Chen missed an opportunity to improve relations with
Beijing last summer. He didn't elaborate what the chance was.</P>
      <P>In response, Hsiao said President Chen has adopted many
"market opening" measures to improve cross-strait ties since his
inauguration one and half years ago, including easing restrictions on
mainland China-bound investments and opening doors to mainland
journalists and tourists.</P>
      <P>In her view, Hsiao said, the DPP government has been far more
active than the previous KMT administration in breaking
cross-strait stalemate.</P>

    <HEADLINE>REMAINS OF FORMER AIR FORCE SURVEILLANCE CREW RETURNED TO TAIWAN</HEADLINE>

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The remains of 14 crew members of a
surveillance aircraft that was shot down by mainland Chinese fighters
in Jiangxi province nearly four decades ago were airlifted back to
Taiwan Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Surviving relatives of the crew of the former Republic of China
Air Force's 34th Squadron, nicknamed the Black Bats Squadron,
gathered at Chiang Kai-shek International Airport to receive the
remains of the pilots, co-pilots and technical and information
officers 38 years after the secret mishap.</P>
      <P>The 14 air force crew, led by squadron leader Colonel Chou Yi-su,
were aboard a P-2V, a U.S. long-range patrol aircraft, on a
reconnaissance mission in mainland China's central province of
Jiangxi when the aircraft was intercepted by mainland Chinese jet
fighters and shot down on June 19, 1963. None of the crew members
reportedly survived.</P>
      <P>The whereabouts of the reconnaissance officers were discovered by
locals soon after the mishap and their remains have been kept in
Chiangxi under the instruction of the mainland Chinese authorities,
although private talks about having the remains returned to Taiwan
did not start until recent years after Taiwan opened people-to-people
exchanges across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>In a simple but solemn ceremony at the CKS Airport, Major General
Liu Yi-tien, the ROC Air Force's top personnel officer, covered the
remains, which were in two boxes, with the ROC national flag in a
gesture of respects to the late air force officers.</P>
      <P>The remains of the 14 officers and their name plates are
scheduled to be incorporated into the ROC Air Force cemetery located
in Hsintien, Taipei County Dec. 10 in a ceremony to be presided over
by Air Force Commander-in-Chief Gen. Chen Chao-min.</P>
      <P>At the airport were Hsiao Chia-chen, wife of the dead squadron
leader. She has been instrumental over the past decade in arranging
the downed squadron's return to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to Hsiao, she and some family members of the squadron
visited mainland China three times before the mainland Chinese
authorities gave the green light to allow the remains to be taken
back to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Now that the officers are home they will be able to rest in
peace, Hsiao said.</P>
      <P>Also at the airport was 39-year-old Huang Fei, daughter of
co-pilot Major Huang Chi-hsin. Huang Fei, who works at a bank in
Taipei, said although she had no memory of her father, as she was
only 10 months old when the secret incident occurred, she has her
father's picture and has always believed that he was always with her.</P>

      <P>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp.
(TSMC) may lead the world in the 0.1 micron technology in the fourth
quarter of next year, an executive of a United States-based hi-tech
firm said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>N. K. Wang, vice executive officer of Applied Micron Inc., said
TSMC would capture the world's leadership role if the company based
in the Hsinchu Science-based Industrial Park in northern Taiwan could
complete development of that technology by that time.</P>
      <P>Delivering a keynote speech on the development of the
semiconductor industry, Wang said the Asia-Pacific region has
replaced North America as the world's largest semiconductor market in
2001. He predicted that the Asia-Pacific market will be able to seize
a 46-percent stake of the global market in 2010, ahead of the U. S.
market's 24 percent, Europe's 16 percent and Japan's 14 percent.</P>
      <P>Wang, pointed out, however, that mainland China, which is
included in the Asia-Pacific market, will take 13 percent of the
international market at that time.</P>
      <P>According to the Applied Materials executive, the market scale of
the international semiconductor industry hit around US$209 billion in
2000, with North America contributing 31 percent. The Asia-Pacific
market and the Japanese market generated 25 percent and 23 percent,
respectively.</P>
      <P>He also estimated that the Asia-Pacific market (excluding Japan)
will absorb 28.4 percent of the world's overall production of
eight-inch silicon wafer chips -- 9.41 million pieces -- next year,
only behind Japan's 29.3 percent, while the region's production of
hi-end chips will top the world.</P>
      <P>In face of future challenges, Wang urged businesses to cooperate
to reduce production costs.</P>

      <P>Taiwan-made products are increasingly being
replaced by those from mainland China in the Japanese market in
recent years, government statistics show.</P>
      <P>According to tallies released recently by the Ministry of

nine months of this year registered the largest fall of 15 percent
among the four Asian Dragons year-on-year, while mainland China's
export value to that country grew by 7.2 percent.</P>
      <P>The MOEA attributed the decline to a global economic slump, which
has also slashed demand for hi-tech products in the Japanese market.
Taiwan is a major supplier of computers, machinery and optical
equipment for Japan.</P>
      <P>During the same nine-month period, Japan posted a 4 percent fall
in imports, while its outbound shipments declined by 14 percent.</P>
      <P>Among the four Asian Dragons, South Korea grabbed the largest

percent, Singapore with 1.6 percent and Hong Kong with 0.4 percent.
Mainland China enjoys a 16 percent stake in the Japanese market.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu said Tuesday it
is a great honor for her to win the 2001 World Peace Prize
awarded by the World Peace Corps Academy.</P>
      <P>In her remarks of appreciation to the academy, Lu said that
instead of claiming the prize as her personal achievement, it should
be deemed as the "common achievement of the people of Taiwan."</P>
      <P>A longtime democracy activist and feminist, Lu said that as a
woman, she has gone through various kinds of suffering in her life.
The outspoken vice president said she not only has to overcome the
poverty, but also to triumph over gender discrimination and political
dictatorship.</P>
      <P>"It is encouraging for me to say that I have never played
political tricks. I have never resorted to violence. I always touch
the hearts of others and lead people with my ideals and ideas through
peaceful and democratic procedures, even if it needs to sacrifice
myself," Lu said in her written remarks of appreciation to the World
Peace Corps Academy.</P>
      <P>Lu went on to say that she is one of many Taiwanese who have
"created the soft power of "human rights, democracy, peace, love and
high technology" on the island.</P>
      <P>"In contrast to the hard power of those countries committed to
military and economic plunders, Taiwan's soft power miracle is a
blessing for all mankind," Lu said, adding that Taiwan is
always willing to cooperate and share its fruits with others, to
eliminate hatred and pursue sustainable stability with love and
peace.</P>
      <P>Lester Wolff, the chief judge of the World Peace Prize Awarding
Council, announced on the U.S. Capitol Hill Nov. 28 that the 2001
World Peace Prize will be given to Lu in recognition of her
contribution to promoting Taiwan's democratization and world peace.</P>
      <P>Wolff, a former member of the U.S. House of Representatives,
said the award presentation ceremony will be held in Taipei Dec. 9.</P>
      <P>Lu, who was once jailed for six years for her pro-democracy
activities during Taiwan's martial law era, has continued to promote
peace, love, democracy, human rights and high-tech development since
she became the ROC's first female vice president in May 2000.</P>
      <P>Lu is the first female winner of the World Peace Prize since the
inauguration of the award in 1990.</P>
      <P>The previous recipients of the prestigious prize included former
U.S. President Ronald Reagan, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarrak,
South Korea's first president, Syngman Rhee, and late Israeli Prime

    <HEADLINE>WHEELING AND DEALING OVER PRESIDENCY OF LEGISLATURE UNDERWAY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 4 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Wheeling and dealing over the presidency of
the Legislative Yuan is underway between the Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) and the incumbent head of the legislature and Kuomintang
(KMT) member Wang Jin-pyng.</P>
      <P>The DPP whip at the legislature, Tsai Huang-lang, said Tuesday
that his party might support Wang's bid for reelection if the KMT
vice chairman joins in President Chen Shui-bian's "National
Stabilization Alliance," and the "Taiwan Advocates" think tank
founded by former President Lee Teng-hui to support Chen's
administration.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the legislature, Tsai confirmed Wang's job
performance and his freedom from partisan politics over the last
three years, but said his refusal to join Chen's alliance and the
Taiwan Advocates will cast doubt on his political detachment, and
give credit to claims that he is more a president for his KMT party.</P>
      <P>"We may support his reelection bid if Wang joins those two
groups," Tsai said.</P>
      <P>Touting the "National Stabilization Alliance" as a forum for
political parties to work out their differences, Tsai said the
opposition parties that have seen seats between them pared sharply in
the just-concluded legislative elections should not resist public
opinion by boycotting the alliance.</P>
      <P>His remarks have drawn sharp criticism from lawmakers of the
People First Party (PFP) which is a KMT breakaway and is wary of any
political deal between the DPP and the KMT.</P>
      <P>PFP legislator Chin Hui-chu said Tsai's offer was an unveiled
attempt at horse-trading, and naked political bargaining.</P>
      <P>Chin said there is no reason for President Chen to create a
"National Stabilization Alliance" -- which is not provided for in the
Constitution -- now that the DPP is already the largest party in the
legislature with 87 out of 225 seats.</P>
      <P>Another PFP legislator, Liu Wen-hsiung, said President Chen
should come up with economic recovery programs instead of forcing the
opposition to fall behind his alliance under the pretext of
"improving national stabilization."</P>
      <P>Wang, who announced his candidacy last Saturday, gave a cold
shoulder to the DPP's offer Tuesday, although he could not win
reelection without the support of the DPP.</P>
      <P>He said he will follow his party's decision on whether to join
President Chen's alliance. If the KMT agrees to take part in the
movement, he automatically will be a member of the alliance, he said.</P>
      <P>The KMT vice chairman disclosed that KMT Chairman Lien Chan is
expected to call on President Chen to exchange views on
post-elections issues.</P>
      <P>Wang said Lien told him of his plan to call on Chen Sunday, but
didn't say when the meeting would take place or what issues are on
the agenda.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, DPP legislator Trong Chai, who is one of several DPP
aspirants to the legislature presidency, continued his tour around
the island Tuesday to marshal support for his bid.</P>
      <P>He said he has called on more than 80 newly-elected lawmakers of
various parties and was met with enthusiastic support from many of
them for his attempt to become the first DPP president of the
Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Some of them, including KMT legislator Hung Chao-nan, even
expressed the intention to be his running mate for vice presidency of
the legislature, Chai said.</P>
      <P>He admitted, however, his personal desire is subject to the
approval of party leaders, especially President Chen who might decide
otherwise after taking into account the overall political situation.</P>

founded by Lee, at the Ambassador Hotel in Taipei Monday night.</P>
      <P>Hsieh pointed out that the TSU is a political party friendly to
the DPP. Both parties uphold a common goal to maintain political
stabilization.</P>
      <P>In addition, Taiwan Advocates will help form the proposed
"National Stabilization Aalliance" that President Chen has proposed
before the elections. The DPP welcomes all political parties or
groups to join the alliance to help stabilize the nation's political
situation, Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>If someone interpreted the Lee-Chen meeting as the formation of a
kind of cooperation between them, that person was simply worrying too
much, Hsieh said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>IC NATIONAL HEALTH INSURANCE CARDS IN THE OFFING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 4 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Electronic national health insurance cards,
which are designed to replace the existing paper cards, are scheduled
to be issued July 2002, the National Health Insurance Bureau (NHIB)
said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Some 7 million IC health insurance cards will be issued initially
in July for use by patients in the cities of Taipei, Taichung and
Kaohsiung, and Penghu County, NHIB officials said.</P>
      <P>It is expected that by May 2003, every citizen in Taiwan who is
covered under the national health insurance program will have an IC
health insurance card.</P>
      <P>In a ceremony held Tuesday to debut the new IC cards, Department
of Health Director-General Lee Ming-liang showed off his own IC
health insurance card which carries his photo on one side.</P>
      <P>Introducing the new cards at the ceremony, NHIB deputy director
Chiang Hung-che said cardholders can decide for themselves whether to
have their photos on the cards or not.</P>
      <P>Chiang said the planned IC health insurance cards, which will be
designed by the German company that designed the euro and produced by
Taipei's TECO Electric and Machinery Co., can be used as
identification cards and will be valid for five years.</P>
      <P>The IC card can also be used as a donor's card and a portable
file of a patient's medical records, Chiang said, adding that these
innovations will save patients and their doctors much time in
diagnoses and filling prescriptions.</P>
      <P>IC health insurance cards should save the nation and patients
money as well, Chiang said. Although the NHIB needs to invest some
NT$4 billion (US$116 million) to have all the existing paper cards
replaced, the investment is expected to be recouped soon, he said.</P>
      <P>Chiang added that the NHIB spends about NT$100 million a year on
paper card renewals since each card needs to be replaced when all six
spaces on the back of the card have been stamped.</P>
      <P>IC health insurance cards will also help save labor costs that
are required in paper card renewals. With the new cards, medical
resources should not be wasted because each IC card will carry a
patient's past diagnoses and prescription records, and will help
deter fraud through unauthorized use of cards, Chiang said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PFP NOT TO MERGE WITH OTHER PARTIES, SAYS PFP CHAIRMAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  4  (CNA)
(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>People First Party (PFP) Chairman James
Soong asserted Tuesday that the PFP, which performed well in last
Saturday's elections to win 46 seats in the legislature, has no plan
to merge with other parties.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks while commenting on some proposals that the
Kuomintang (KMT) and the PFP should cooperate or merge to form a
majority in the 225-seat Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>The KMT suffered a defeat in the elections, gaining only 68 seats
in the legislature, while the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) achieving a victory to take 87 seats. The newly established
Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU), supported by former President Lee
Teng-hui, collected 13 seats.</P>
      <P>Soong told a news conference that results of the elections
indicated that the identity of the PFP, which was formed by Soong
after the March 18 presidential election last year, has been
gradually recognized by the voters.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, he noted that his party is willing to cooperate and
communicate with other parties if it will benefit the supervising
task of the opposition.</P>
      <P>The PFP chief, a former KMT secretary-general, said he will meet
with KMT Chairman Lien Chan to exchange views on how to play a more
constructive opposition role after communicating with newly elected
legislators of his party.</P>
      <P>Regarding the party's basic political stand, Soong said that the
country's stabilization relies on a mild solution to the ethnic and
cross-Taiwan Strait issues.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian should respect the constitutional
system and the "one-China" principle as stipulated in the
Constitution, Soong pointed out.</P>
      <P>He urged Chen and Lee to cease using emotional language that was
used during the campaigning because "it would not be in the interests
of the Taiwan people if the Taiwan issue must be resolved through
military means."</P>
      <P>Soong also said that his party plans to introduce a new rule to
name the party chairman through direct elections by the party's
members.</P>
      <P>He said that PFP Vice Chairman Chang Chao-hsiung has been
entrusted with the task of consolidating the opinions of the party in
this regard.</P>
      <P>On the election of the new president and vice president of the
Legislative Yuan, Soong said that the party's stance will be
announced after the political situation settles down a bit.</P>
      <P>He added that former Legislative Yuan President Liu Sung-pan, a
PFP legislator, will take charge of the party's mission to promote
legislative reform.</P>
      <P>At the same time, PFP Policy Center Director Chang Hsien-yao
stressed that the PFP will stick to its middle-of-the-road role.</P>
      <P>He said that the PFP will be happy to see a successful reform of
the KMT and would not like to see it fragmented. But he also said
that it is "absolutely impossible for the PFP to merge with the KMT."</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAURITIUS BOY HAS A NEW FACE AFTER  CRANIOFACIAL SURGERY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  4  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The 16-year-old Chinese boy who traveled
thousands of miles to Taiwan from Mauritius for an operation to
correct a facial disfigurement was happy Tuesday that his dream is
coming true.</P>
      <P>Kevin Chan-kam, who suffers from Pfeiffer syndrome, was
discharged from Chang Gung Memorial Hospital Tuesday with a new, full
and beautiful face that he has coveted since he was six years old.</P>
      <P>The boy was allowed to check out only after Chang Gung surgeons
announced that the craniofacial surgery operation, performed Nov. 30,
was successful and the young man was recovering normally.</P>
      <P>Despite swelling, Chan-kam now can, for the first time in his
life, have his upper jaw meet the lower jaw, with doctors estimating
that he will be able to chew as any normal person does in one month.</P>
      <P>Chan-kam's parents, both Chinese descendants of early Cantonese
immigrants to Mauritius, who stayed with him round-the-clock over the
past week, offered their sincerest gratitude to the Chang Gung
medical team for their expertise and thanked God for the success of
the operation.</P>
      <P>To correct the boy's congenital craniofacial deformity, which
featured severe mid-face retrusion and mandible protrusion, the
surgeons pulled his upper jaw out 1.5 centimeters and pushed his lower
jaw in an equal distance.</P>
      <P>A rib was removed and used to fill in the gap created by pulling
out the upper jaw, doctors said.</P>
      <P>Doctors said that the scope of the adjustment required to rectify
the young man's dental malocclusion was three times greater than
normal craniofacial surgeries are called on to deliver.</P>
      <P>His ability to chew, speak and even breathe will be markedly
improved, doctors added.</P>
      <P>For Chan-kam, this is more important than anything else now that
his dream of eating a steak will soon be realized.</P>
      <P>The boy underwent extensive cranial remodeling in South Africa
when he was four months old to allow his brain to develop normally,
with subsequent follow-up remodeling operations at ages 1 and 6.</P>
      <P>Despite his physical inconvenience, Chan-kam is an excellent
student who recently placed 49th among over 14,000 teens who took
part in Mauritius' nationwide high school exams. He said he hopes to
become an accountant.</P>
      <P>The Chang Gung authority promised to foot all the medical bills
for the costs of the boy's operation and follow-up treatments, while
Taiwan's Noordhoff Craniofacial Foundation will sponsor his living
expenses for the one-and-a-half months that he is expected to stay on
the island.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The "national stabilization alliance"
proposed by President Chen Shui-bian will not override the
Constitution; on the contrary, it will operate under and give full
respect to the Constitution, Premier Chang Chun-hsiung said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>In a defense of the proposed alliance, advocated by President
Chen in the run-up to last Saturday's elections for legislators, city
mayors and country magistrates, Chang said the alliance will be
devised to break the political stalemate caused by a legislature with
no one-party majority.</P>
      <P>The opposition has been cautious about the idea. They question
the constitutionality of forming such an alliance, warning that it
could be a political ploy to divide them.</P>
      <P>Premier Chang said that the alliance is the president's response
to public demands for a stable government which can concentrate on
addressing problems such as national security, economic development
and mainland China relations.</P>
      <P>The results of the elections, which gave the president's
Democratic Progressive Party an increase of 22 seats in the
legislature, vindicate the president's political wisdom in realizing
beforehand what the public wanted, Chang said.</P>
      <P>Now that the elections are over, the premier said, political
parties should correctly grasp the messages from it by burying the
hatchet and joining hands to do the work the public demands, Chang
said, adding that the way to do this would be to participate in the
"national stabilization alliance."</P>
      <P>Although the alliance is not based on the Constitution, whatever
decision taken by it will be processed and implemented by the
Legislative Yuan and Executive Yuan in due process, Chang said.</P>
      <P>There is no question of giving the alliance powers above the
Constitution, Chang explained, although the detailed structure of the
alliance has yet to be worked out.</P>
      <P>The premier said it is preferable to form the alliance out of
various political parties, but he could not rule out the
participation of individual political leaders.</P>

      <P>Several private Taiwan charitable groups are
weighing the possibility of providing medical aid to Afghanistan
refugees on a long-term basis after a fact-finding trip to that
country.</P>
      <P>Liu Chih-chuan, president of the Taiwan Root Medical
Organization, which offers medical service to Taiwan aborigines, said
Tuesday that his group might extend their services to refugees in
Afghanistan.</P>
      <P>Liu said he and a member of Taiwan's Compassionate Relief Tzu Chi
Foundation visited Afghanistan late last month to get first hand
information about what the Taiwan groups could do to help the
refugees.</P>
      <P>Liu said they entered Nimroze province in southeastern
Afghanistan from Iran and visited a refugee camp in Makaki which is
home to about 10,000 displaced Afghans. But there are only 1,500
tents at the site that can accommodate five people each. The rest
have to sleep in shacks made of cloth or anything they can lay their
hands on or live in caves, said Liu.</P>
      <P>There are only a few supplies of water and electricity. There
were also too few toilets and the poor sanitary in the camp and the
frequent sandstorms in that area of Afghanistan led to the prevalence
of eye disorders and other diseases.</P>
      <P>Medical facilities, however, were scarce and there is a serious
shortage of medical personnel and medicines. Most of the people
living there have never seen a dentist all of their lives, Liu said.</P>
      <P>Liu said he left Makaki on Nov. 21 when a snowstorm set in. Since
the war in Afghanistan has lulled somewhat, Liu said his group is
planning to provide long-term medical aid to that country as soon as
next spring if possible.</P>

Garrison General Headquarters for conducting direct trade with the
Communist Chinese.

Motse's lesson of the day: "When the administration of the ruler
answers to the desire of the subjects, it manifests an understanding
of approvals and disapprovals of the people. When there is such an
understanding, the good will be discovered and rewarded and the bad
will be discovered and punished, and the country will surely attain
order."</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING CAN'T AFFORD NOT TO TALK WITH ROC PRESIDENT: TECO CHIEF</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  Dec.  4  (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The results of Saturday's legislative
elections in Taiwan have given President Chen Shui-bian a stronger
position in terms of implementing political and economic reforms,
Taiwan's top representative in Canada said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Thomas T.P. Chen told an audience at the Ottawa Chapter of the
Society for International Development that mainland China's
leadership, which has consistently refused to talk with the Chen
administration, "cannot afford not to negotiate with him" now that
his Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has become the largest party
in the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Chen, who heads the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office, Canada,
predicted that the DPP, which won 87 seats in the 225-seat
Legislative Yuan, will be joined by the 13 newly elected Taiwan
Solidarity Union (TSU) lawmakers as well as by 20 other independents
or legislators from among the opposition parties.</P>
      <P>"When you divide a watermelon into several slices, people swarm
to the biggest slice," he said, using a Taiwanese expression to
describe the phenomenon of independent and opposition lawmakers
defecting to the ruling camp.</P>
      <P>The president has termed the proposed legislative coalition "the
National Stabilization Alliance," without which his administrative
agenda will be blocked as it had been during the first half of his
term when the DPP held only one-third of the seats in the
Legislature.</P>
      <P>The Kuomintang (KMT), which has dominated the Republic of China's
Legislative Yuan for the past five decades, saw its share of
legislative seats shrink to 68. The People First Party (PFP), led by
former Taiwan Gov. James Soong, won 46 seats, with the remaining
legislative seats going to independents or other minor parties.</P>
      <P>Thomas Chen observed that the New Party (NP), which has advocated
Beijing's "one country, two systems" arrangement for Taiwan, was
almost annihilated, being reduced to a single seat in the
Legislature.</P>
      <P>Several academics and diplomats in the audience at the gathering
said that Beijing certainly will not be happy with the election
results, but it will have to live with the choice made by the people
of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Some of them expressed concern that economic integration between
Taiwan and mainland China may reduce Taiwan's leverage in seeking a
resolution to the on-going dispute over the issue of sovereignty. For
example, mainland China has made it clear that it will not talk trade
issues with Taiwan in the World Trade Organization (WTO).</P>
      <P>Chen pointed out that such strategies "cut both ways" -- by not
talking with the democratically elected government of Taiwan, Beijing
risks encouraging Taiwan investors to look elsewhere for business
opportunities. He added that the ROC government can back them up with
its huge foreign exchange reserves.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING REJECTS CROSS-STRAIT `DIRECT LINKS' TALKS UNDER WTO FRAMEWORK</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  5  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Beijing authorities on Wednesday sternly
rejected Taiwan's proposal that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait
could commence dialogue on the "three direct links" issue under the
framework of the World Trade Organization (WTO).</P>
      <P>The spokesman for Beijing's Central Office for Taiwan Affairs,
Zhang Mingqing, ruled out during a routine press conference in
Beijing the possibility of the two sides engaging in talks under the
WTO framework on opening direct cross-strait trade, postal and
transportation links.</P>
      <P>Zhang said that both mainland China and Taiwan are becoming full
members of the WTO and that both sides should observe closely the
regulations and spirit of the WTO.</P>
      <P>He noted however that the issue of the so-called "three direct
links" is an "internal matter" which should be discussed under the
"one China" principle.</P>
      <P>If necessary, he added, the two sides can talk about direct links
in a private manner, such as via discussions between companies or
private parties from across the strait.</P>
      <P>Commenting on Taiwan's just-concluded elections for legislators
and local government chiefs, Zhang said a victory for the
pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in the elections
would not change Beijing's policies toward the island.</P>
      <P>Zhang said that through the elections, Beijing has perceived that
the mainstream private opinion in Taiwan is against independence and
strongly for peace, stability and the positive development of
cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>Noting that Beijing will closely monitor Taiwan's cross-strait
policies, Zhang said Beijing strongly expects that the Taiwan
authorities will recognize the "one China" policy and return to the
"92 consensus" which he said would be conducive to the constructive
development of cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>In response to Zhang's remarks, Yen Chien-fa, director of the
ruling DPP's China Affairs Office, said that mainland Chinese
authorities acted cautiously regarding the Dec. 1 elections, being
careful not to get involved, but that they were startled by the
election results.</P>
      <P>Reacting to the "unexpected" election results, Beijing chose
first to "steady its steps" and then to reiterate the "one China"
principle, Yen continued.</P>
      <P>He said he doesn't expect there will be any breakthrough in the
development of cross-strait relations after the elections, but he
added that he doesn't expect relations to regress either.</P>
      <P>Discounting Zhang's remark that it is impossible for the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait to talk about the "three direct links"
issue under the WTO framework, Yen said that it is possible and
feasible that the two sides talk about direct trade exchanges
under the regulations and spirit of the WTO.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN VOTERS DON'T BUY `ONE CHINA, TWO SYSTEMS' SCHEME SAYS PREMIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  5  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Most Taiwan voters have said clearly via
their ballots this past weekend that they do not buy the so-called
"one China, two systems" overture by mainland China, Premier Chang
Chun-hsiung said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Chang called for Beijing to perceive and take account of the
"real mainstream private opinion" in Taiwan that has been clearly
reflected in the recently concluded elections, pointing out that a
majority of the Taiwan public refuses to accept Beijing's "one China,
two systems" scheme that was imposed on the former British colony of
Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>The premier reiterated that Taiwan's basic policies toward
mainland China will remain unchanged and that the nation will
continue to work toward improving cross-strait relations based on the
principles of "goodwill reconciliation, active cooperation and
long-lasting peace" that President Chen Shui-bian spelled out in his
inaugural speech last year.</P>
      <P>Chang added that all "opening" policies toward mainland China,
substantiating the conclusions reached by consensus during the
Economic Development Advisory Conference held in August, will be
carried out in accordance with a set timetable.</P>
      <P>He also urged the authorities in Beijing to grasp the opportunity
for reconciliation between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait and
resume institutionalized cross-strait dialogue as well as useful
interactions.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAC REITERATES PRINCIPLES FOR RESUMING DIALOGUE WITH MAINLAND CHINA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Dec.   5  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC)
reiterated Wednesday Taiwan's willingness to resume dialogue with
Beijing based on the principles of "sovereignty and equality" as soon
as possible.</P>
      <P>Officials from the Cabinet-level MAC said Taiwan's policies
toward mainland China would not be changed by the results of the Dec.
1 elections.</P>
      <P>Dismissing remarks made earlier in the day by Zhang Mingqing, a
spokesman for Beijing's Central Office for Taiwan Affairs, who said
the percentage of Taiwan people supporting the "one China, two
systems" formula is on the rise, the MAC officials said the mainland
Chinese authorities' perception and understanding of the people of
Taiwan are apparently far from reality.</P>
      <P>The officials said that in fact, a poll conducted after the
leadership summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum held
in Shanghai in mid-October has found that Taiwan popular support for
Beijing's "one China, two systems" model for communist rule over the
island has dropped compared with the results of a similar poll
conducted in July.</P>
      <P>In a routine press conference, Zhang also stressed that it is
imperative that Taiwan should recognize the "one China" policy, and
added that Beijing's perception of the election results is that the
mainstream public opinion in Taiwan is against independence and
strongly for peace, stability and the positive development of
cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>The MAC officials said that with the passing of the elections,
many uncertainties surrounding cross-strait relations have also
become history and reiterated that the Republic of China is willing
to return to the negotiating table with mainland authorities for
talks based on the principles of sovereignty and equality.</P>

from Taiwan's lawmakers to allow them to be reunited after four years
apart as a result of the husband's medical condition.</P>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An official of the Council for Economic
Planning and Development (CEPD) said Wednesday that the conditions
needed for Taiwan's economic recovery have emerged and that Taiwan's
economy will bottom out sooner than has been predicted.</P>
      <P>According to CEPD Secretary-General Thomas Yeh, the
483.44-point su0rge in stock prices since the Dec. 1 elections -- an
increase of more than 10 percent -- shows the public confidence in
the election results and that all conditions for moving toward
prosperity have emerged.</P>
      <P>Yeh said that cross-party cooperation after the election will
allow more room for the government to maneuver, which he said will
have a positive effect on Taiwan's political and economic
development.</P>
      <P>Foreign institutional investors are also confident of Taiwan's
economic recovery and are continuing to pump capital into the stock
market, Yeh went on, adding that the economy in the United States is
also expected to bottom out in the second quarter of next year.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and
Statistics (DGBAS) said Wednesday that the wholesale price index
dropped 4.68 percent in November, the ninth consecutive monthly drop
and the largest since August 1999.</P>
      <P>As wholesale prices will affect consumer prices between two and
seven months, the drop shows that consumer prices will continue to
slump over the next few months, Yeh continued.</P>
      <P>DGBAS officials said that the consumer price index dropped 1.13
percent in November, the biggest drop since Nov. 1987.</P>
      <P>The officials said that in the first 11 months of the year,
consumer prices increased by 0.15 percent and estimated that consumer
price index growth will be 0.11 percent this year, or the smallest
increase since 1986.</P>
      <P>The wholesale price index in the first 11 months of this year
dropped 0.93 percent and the officials predicted that the wholesale

    <HEADLINE>POLITICAL PARTIES CALL FOR REFORM OF ELECTORAL SYSTEMS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  5  (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Dec. 1 elections of legislators, city
mayors and county magistrates have resulted in considerable changes
in Taiwan's political landscape and the island's political parties
are calling for an urgent reform of the electoral systems.</P>
      <P>Both the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and the main
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) advocate moving from the existing single
non-transferable vote system to a single-member constituency,
two-vote system.</P>
      <P>Under the Public Officials Election and Recall Law, several
legislators are elected from a single constituency, which is
demarcated essentially according to administrative boundaries. Each
voter can cast one vote for a candidate of his or her preference.</P>
      <P>Both Minister of the Interior Chang Po-ya and Chairman Huang
Shih-cheng of the Central Election Commission have agreed that Taiwan
should adopt the single-member constituency system and that each
voter should be entitled to cast two votes -- one for a district
candidate and one for a political party.</P>
      <P>The existing system, by allowing more candidates to represent one
party, may encourage factionalism, as candidates of the same party
are constantly at odds with one another. In-party disputes were
common during the legislative election campaign.</P>
      <P>Some local political observers have noted that quite a few
candidates with high prestige in the party failed in the Dec. 1
election because of what they describe as improper functioning of the
party nomination system and flaws in the electoral mechanism.</P>
      <P>The single-member constituency, two-vote system would help
reinforce internal cohesion and party discipline, which would be
beneficial to negotiations and cooperation between political parties,
according to the observers.</P>
      <P>Since both the ruling and opposition parties agree over the
advantages of the single-member constituency, two-vote system, the
new legislature may be able to initiate efforts to revise the Public
Officials Election and Recall Law regarding the electoral systems
before the next election.</P>
      <P>As the both ruling party and the largest party in the Legislative
Yuan, the DPP is expected to play an important role in accomplishing
this reform work. Even before the DPP gained the upper hand in the
Legislative Yuan, DPP Secretary-general Wu Nai-jen had stressed his
party's hopes of accomplishing the reforms in the next legislature.</P>
      <P>Political observers have pointed out that changing from the
existing multiple-member constituencies to single-member
constituencies is a big project that will not be easy, especially
when it is complicated by conflicts of interest.</P>
      <P>Since the reform would involve an amendment to the Constitution,
the revised law must be approved by three-quarters of the legislature
and passed by the National Assembly, making consensus among
legislators vital.</P>
      <P>An official of the Interior Ministry has pointed out the
difficulty in achieving such consensus, noting that the Ministry of
the Interior submitted drafts of revised election laws to the
Legislative Yuan in 1997 and again in 2000, but they were not even
screened by the legislators.</P>
      <P>The official said that the draft revisions were in relation to a
much-criticized flaw in the existing laws regarding the publication
of opinion poll results and the draft revisions stipulated that no
publication of opinion polls regarding candidates or election
predictions would be allowed within five days of an election.</P>
      <P>Several candidates who were reported by the media to have the
highest scores in pre-election opinion polls failed in the Dec. 1
elections and some frustrated candidates blamed their failure on
misleading opinion poll results that were manipulated by their
rivals.</P>
      <P>New Party Legislator Lai Shyh-bao, for instance, was named as one
of the most dedicated and knowledgeable legislators by the
prestigious CommonWealth Magazine in its November issue and was
constantly at top of pre-election opinion polls. However, the
legislator failed in his re-election bid because, he claimed, many of
his supporters believed he had votes to spare.</P>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung said Tuesday that the Cabinet has
drafted a new revised law on the issue and that he is looking forward
to early legislative approval of the revised law.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT WILL NOT JOIN COALITION GOVERNMENT: KMT CHAIRMAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  5  (CNA)
(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien
Chan said Wednesday that the KMT will not join the "national
stabilization alliance" or the coalition government proposed by
President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks while speaking at the party's Central
Standing Committee meeting in the wake of the party's resounding
defeat in the Dec. 1 legislative elections.</P>
      <P>Lien said that the KMT unchanged stance is to protect and uphold
the Constitution.</P>
      <P>The KMT lost all but 68 of its pre-election 115 seats in the
225-seat Legislative Yuan, while the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) gained 87 seats to replace the KMT as the largest party
in the legislature.</P>
      <P>Lien said that the DPP and the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU),
which is supported by former President Lee Teng-hui, now control
between them 100 seats in the Legislative Yuan and added that they
can form a coalition government in line with the constitutional
system.</P>
      <P>He also said there is "no need" to establish a "national
stabilization alliance," which he described as beyond the
constitutional system.</P>
      <P>The KMT chief said that his party will perform its duty as a
responsible opposition to supervise the administration of the
government.</P>
      <P>If the government's policies, bills and budget are in line with
the interests and welfare of the people, he said that the KMT will
support them.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, he went on, the KMT will oppose policies it
believes are erroneous, such as the decision to halt the
construction of the island's fourth nuclear power plant.</P>
      <P>Regarding cooperation between the opposition parties, Lien said
that the KMT is willing to cooperate with the People First Party
(PFP) and other opposition parties on the formulation of policies and
laws. The PFP collected 46 seats in the legislature in the elections.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FORMER PREMIER DEFENDS STANCE ON RECONCILIATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 6 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Kuomintang (KMT) Vice Chairman Vincent Siew
defended on Thursday his proposition the previous day that the
opposition KMT help the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)-led
government in revitalizing Taiwan's economy.</P>
      <P>Dismissing insinuations that some KMT heavyweights are
"defecting" to the ruling DPP just to gain a few positions in the
government, Siew, formerly premier, said that "it's not my style and
it's against my principles as a decent human being" to suggest
cooperation and reconciliation for the sake of personal gain.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the KMT's Central Standing Committee meeting
Wednesday, Siew said the KMT should help the DPP government get the
nation's economy back on track.</P>
      <P>He said the KMT shouldn't be antagonistic in handling its
relations with other parties, adding that the KMT should also not be
misled by rumors that some party members plan to defect to the DPP.</P>
      <P>Siew's remarks during the KMT meeting challenged the KMT's
decision made after the Dec. 1 elections not to align with the DPP in
the Legislature, and led Wu Poh-hsiung, another KMT vice chairman, to
take issue with Siew's comments.</P>
      <P>Noting that the KMT should play its role as an "honest" and
"loyal" opposition party, Wu said "we must not fall into a trap set
by people with the intention of splitting the KMT just to gain a few
positions in the government."</P>
      <P>According to some reports, Siew is among the candidates favored
by the DPP to assume the position of premier when the new Legislature
convenes in February.</P>
      <P>Clarifying his stance, Siew said he only suggested the previous
day that the KMT take the initiative in cooperating with the
administration simply for the sake of saving Taiwan's economy from
being aggravated further.</P>
      <P>He added that KMT Chairman Lien Chan noted later in Wednesday's
meeting that it is the responsibility of all the parties concerned to
work together to seek solutions to the people's plight and find ways
to rev up the economy, which he said is exactly in line with what he
has suggested.</P>
      <P>Siew stressed that as a veteran economics official who has
received governmental training and experience over a long period of
time, he made the remarks Wednesday for the sake of the economy, the
country and the people's well-being but not for the sake of anything
else.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT AND PFP DECIDE NOT TO TAKE PART IN CHEN'S PROPOSED ALLIANCE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  6  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's two largest opposition parties
decided Thursday not to participate in the "national stabilization
alliance" that has been proposed by President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan and People First
Party (PFP) Chairman James Soong met for the first time after the
Dec. 1 elections Thursday and reached a four-point consensus on the
state of the nation in the post-election era.</P>
      <P>After a closed-door meeting of several hours, Lien and Soong
jointly announced at a press conference that the KMT and the PFP will
not participate in the Chen-proposed "national stabilization
alliance" nor any other similar, informal grouping that the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) is working to devise.</P>
      <P>Soong said the KMT and the PFP are determined to allow the ruling
DPP, which in the wake of the Dec. 1 elections will be the party with
the most seats in the new Legislature, to fully take up the
responsibility of administration as a ruling party.</P>
      <P>Lien and Soong also came to an agreement that the KMT and the
PFP, now holding 68 seats and 46 seats, respectively, in the 225-seat
Legislative Yuan, jointly form a "policy coordination mechanism," to
be named later, to play the role of a "rational and professional"
check on the administration.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the two party leaders also made it clear that they do
not support the idea of KMT or PFP party members taking up prominent
posts in the Chen Cabinet.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GOV'T NEEDS TO SET UP EMIGRATION AGENCY: O'SEAS CHINESE COMMISSION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 6 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government needs to set up an emigration
agency as soon as possible to provide needed information and services
to emigrants from Taiwan, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission
(OCAC) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Wu Hsin-hsing, OCAC vice minister, made the remarks during a
two-day symposium in Taipei on issues and challenges surrounding the
emigration of Taiwan people.</P>
      <P>He said that Taiwan people often do not make enough preparations
before they emigrate and as a result have insufficient knowledge of
the countries they are moving to, which in turn often leads to
regrettable circumstances.</P>
      <P>Noting that the government has no comprehensive emigration policy
and that related regulations are lacking, he suggested that the
government step up the pace in formulating policy so as to provide
the people of Taiwan with comprehensive information and services. He
added that one of the substantial measures that needs to be
implemented is the establishment of an emigration agency.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Professor Wu Ying-ming of National Sun Yat-sen
University, also speaking at the symposium, said that many Taiwan
people who have emigrated in the past have not actively participated
nor contributed to the new communities within which they live. As a
result, their influence in their adopted communities has been
limited.</P>
      <P>With the trend of globalization, Wu suggested that overseas
Chinese and Taiwan business people build up new concepts, develop
their abilities to influence others, and actively participate in
activities in their new communities.</P>
      <P>He said that emigrants from Taiwan need to change from their past
methods of providing charity and assistance and turn toward more
actively participating in the activities in the communities where
they reside.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NEW KMT PUBLICITY CHIEF VOWS TO PROMOTE 'LOCALIZATION'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 6 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) will promote
"localization" in the wake of its stunning defeat in the
just-concluded legislative elections, the party's new publicity chief
said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Wu Ching-chi, new director of the KMT's Culture and
Communications Committee, made the pledge after being sworn into his
new post at a ceremony presided over by KMT Secretary-General Lin
Fong-cheng.</P>
      <P>Noting that the 107-year-old KMT must reinvent itself to win
voter support, Wu said the party will recruit new blood, introduce
innovative thinking and promote "localization."</P>
      <P>Wu explained that the KMT's "localization" drive should not be
interpreted as a move to advocate Taiwan independence.</P>
      <P>"Our localization aims to boost Taiwan's sustainable
development," Wu said, adding that the KMT's localization will be
characterized as "rational, ethnic harmony, non-agitation and
non-independence."</P>
      <P>Wu said the latest electoral setback augurs that the KMT must
step up efforts to woo young voters. "The KMT must present policy
initiatives and offer new hopes to win the hearts and minds of young
adults."</P>
      <P>Following its defeat in last year's presidential election, the
KMT further lost its 52-year grip on legislative majority after the
Dec. 1 polls.</P>
      <P>"Now, we are neither a ruling party nor the largest party in the
Legislative Yuan. We are an opposition party and should fulfill our
duty of supervising government operations," Wu said.</P>
      <P>As the party's new publicity chief, Wu said he will give priority
to changing the KMT's stereotyped image.</P>
      <P>"We must project a new image as an opposition party and should
let the general public understand the KMT's new role in the island's
post-election political arena," Wu said.</P>
      <P>In addition, Wu said his committee will invite elite members from
the academic community to offer counseling in drawing up a reform
plan for the party's publicity work.</P>
      <P>In preparation for the elections of township and village chiefs
and assembly members early next year, Wu said his committee will work
out new campaign strategies for KMT candidates in the near future.</P>
      <P>Wu, who ran for the post of Tainan County chief and lost to
ruling Democratic Progressive Party candidate Su Huan-chih, succeeded
Wang Chih-kang as the KMT's new publicity chief and spokesman. Wang
resigned to take the blame for the party's poor showing in the
legislative elections in which the party garnered only 68 seats, down
from 110 in the current legislature.</P>
      <P>Wu, 50, obtained a doctorate from National Taiwan Normal
University and pursued post-doctoral studies at Missouri University
and London University. He is a visiting professor at Harvard
University. He has served as vice education minister and as a
division director of the Executive Yuan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CANADIAN PRESS AGENCY TO CARRY CHINESE FINANCIAL DATA WORLDWIDE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  Dec.  5  (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Full Chinese financial data could soon be
available worldwide thanks to a Web-based press agency created by
Quebecers, a French-language newspaper has reported.</P>
      <P>The Quebec City daily Le Soleil quoted Raymond Boisvert, chief
executive officer of China Xin Network, as saying in a report last
weekend that his company wants to become a provider of financial
information and strategic business intelligence for the world market.</P>
      <P>The China Xin Network has recently been listed on the American
Bulletin Board under the letters "FFAX," which will soon be changed
to "CXNC."</P>
      <P>"We're currently tying up a US$3-million financial package that
will enable us to get off to a good start," he told the daily, adding
that "our longer term objective is to be listed on the NASDAQ
electronic exchange."</P>
      <P>A few months ago, the company launched a joint venture with the
China Economic Information Network. According to Boisvert, the latter
organization has a network of 12,000 employees in various cities and
regions who gather all the financial information needed by the
mainland Chinese government.</P>
      <P>"We gave them 35 percent of our company in exchange for the
exclusive use of their information for foreign markets," he added.</P>
      <P>The China Xin Network initially intended to focus on this
exclusive data, which ranges all the way from unemployment figures to
portraits of different sectors such as household appliances. The
company president, however, has already raised his sights.</P>
      <P>Boisvert said that his firm "just signed an agreement with Hong
Yuan Securities, the third or fourth biggest brokerage firm in China.
In exchange for revenue-sharing, they've guaranteed us the exclusive
use of research reports on Chinese companies in the sectors they're
involved in."</P>
      <P>The financial press agency, which will post its dispatches in
English, should be up and running by early next year, with about 200
news items a day, according to Boisvert.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC TOP ECONOMIC PLANNER PREDICTS 2.23% GROWTH FOR TAIWAN IN 2002</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Los Angles, Dec. 6 (CNA)
(By Chu Lu-sheng and Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's unemployment will be kept below
5 percent in 2002 and the exchange rate of the New Taiwan dollar will
not break NT$35 to the U.S. dollar, Taiwan's top economic planner
said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Chen Po-chih, chairman of the Council for Economic Planning and
Development (CEPD), made the remarks in a speech at a University of
California-Los Angles Anderson Forecast meeting.</P>
      <P>Chen said that although the economic performance of Taiwan has
not been too good this year, there should be a 2.23 percent growth
next year, which will be higher than the average global growth of
1.17 percent.</P>
      <P>Predicting the island's economic future, he said that several
industries, specifically the traditional agriculture industry, will
unavoidably suffer from the impact of opening of markets after
Taiwan's entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO) next year.</P>
      <P>The ROC government is now actively helping the transformation of
the agriculture sector, Chen said, adding: "Taiwan has excellent
expertise in agriculture and the CEPD will encourage this sector to
move toward high-tech approaches, including improvement in species
breeding and the production and distribution of high value-added
fruits."</P>
      <P>He stressed that after Taiwan's entry into the WTO, products from
mainland China will not pose a great threat to indigenous products in
Taiwan becuase of their lower quality.</P>
      <P>But he said that if Taiwan businessmen on the mainland re-export
their products back to Taiwan, then such products could become
competitive with local products.</P>
      <P>He also said that although the government has relaxed its "no
haste, be patient" policy toward investment in the mainland, it still
hopes that Taiwan businessmen will make the mainland only one of its
global destinations for investment and not begin an exodus to
mainland China.</P>
      <P>He said that globalization calls for all capable manufacturers
have to have a global perspective. Some products could be produced on
the mainland where raw material costs are cheaper, he said adding
that Taiwan investors should look to all possible advantages,
wherever they may appear.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SEMICONDUCTOR SECTOR WAITING FOR PERMISSION TO INVEST IN M'LAND CHINA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  5  (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>While local authorities in mainland China
are offering attractive incentives to lure Taiwan's semiconductor
manufacturing companies, the mainland China investment screening
committee under the Executive Yuan has decided to meet on Dec. 13 to
study whether to approve such investments.</P>
      <P>Minister of Economic Affairs Lin Hsin-yi said Wednesday that the
government has adjusted its policy regarding Taiwan investments in
mainland China. Instead of applying a "no haste, be patient" policy,
the government would take the initiative and be more open, he added.</P>
      <P>Referring to a report from mainland China that the Soochow
industrial zone administration is offering special preferential
taxation treatment for Taiwan's semiconductor manufacturers, Lin said
that he believed that the semiconductor manufacturers would abide by
the regulations of the ROC government.</P>
      <P>To maintain their international competitiveness, Taiwan's leading
semiconductor manufacturers have sought to reinforce their global
deployments, and mainland China is considered by the manufacturers as
an important production base.</P>
      <P>Dr. F. C. Tseng, deputy chief executive officer of the Taiwan
Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp. (TSMC), said upon returning from a
recent trip to mainland China that the TSMC has set up an office in
Shanghai to collect market information. Having visited several
industrial zones in mainland China, he considered that it would be
more suitable for the TSMC to set up chip fabs in the coastal
province of Jiangsu, he added.</P>
      <P>Refuting reports that the TSMC has purchased land in mainland
China for its production facilities, Tseng said that the TSMC has not
even decided on the plant sites yet.</P>
      <P>The TSMC executive said that his company would abide by ROC
government regulations. The prospects of the international market
would also be an important factor for TSMC to decide on the timing to
realize its investment projects in mainland China, he added.</P>
      <P>Emphasizing that global deployment is the key to success in the
semiconductor sector, Tseng said that TSMC needed to set up more
chip fabs overseas in order to boost its production capacity, since
Taiwan's limited resources could no longer sustain the development of
this international corporation.</P>
      <P>As one of the world's leading IC foundries, TSMC has two six-inch
wafer fabs, nine eight-inch wafer fabs, a joint venture fab with
Philips Semiconductor in Singapore, and more fabs are under
construction in the Tainan Science-based Industrial Park.</P>
      <P>Tseng said that the TSMC has studied possibilities to set up new
fabs in the United States, Europe, Singapore, Israel or mainland
China. After numerous feasibility studies, it was concluded that
mainland China had more advantages than the others, he added.</P>
      <P>The TSMC is not the only semiconductor manufacturer in Taiwan
eyeing mainland China's investment advantages. A group of Taiwan
manufacturers, headed by K. C. Shih, president of the IC design
foundry Global UniChip, will leave for mainland China on Dec. 12 to
meet with their counterparts in two seminars each in Shanghai and
Beijing.</P>
      <P>Chen Wen-hsien, president of the Taiwan Semiconductor Industry
Association, said that Taiwan's manufacturers were eager to know
about mainland China's market climate in the wake of Beijing as well
as Taipei's admissions into the World Trade Organization. While
Taiwan's authorities are likely to relax the restrictions on the
semiconductor industry's investments in mainland China, the
manufacturers need to familiarize themselves with the various
investment regulations across the Strait.</P>
      <P>The semiconductor sector in mainland China is also interested in
seeing the development of Taiwan's semiconductor industry. The
Shanghai Association of Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporations will
organize a mission to visit Taiwan early next year.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Finance Yen Ching-chang said
Thursday that he was confident in the safety of Taiwan's monetary
system, despite the fact that some international media were not
positive about Taiwan's economic development.</P>
      <P>Noting the achievements of monetary reform during the past year,
Yen said that Taiwan's economic competitiveness was better recognized
internationally. On the other hand, problems such as man-made flaws
and rigidity of the monetary system became more obvious in times of
economic sluggishness, he added.</P>
      <P>Yen said that severe competition among the excessive number of
monetary institutions has led to problems of overdue loans and
problem assets. While the insurance companies were facing high risk,
the brokerage firms were also operating in a much too small market.</P>
      <P>Yen said that he hopes that the monetary reform measures will
help streamline the operations of local monetary institutions which
may improve their competitiveness through mergers.</P>
      <P>Yen said that the ministry has made internationalization,
improving the investment environment, and forcing unhealthy financial
institutions out of the market the major tasks. He was confident in a
healthy development of the monetary system, he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SISY CHEN SAYS TAIPEI MAYOR SHOULD RUN FOR PRESIDENT IN 2004</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 6 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Independent legislator-elect Sisy Chen urged
Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou Thursday to run for president in 2004 to
"end ethnocentric politics" in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Ma and Chen were at a discussion on developing Taipei into an
"Internet metropolis." Ma did not reply to Chen's suggestion but did
offer a broad smile.</P>
      <P>Chen, formerly the head of the Democratic Progressive Party's
(DPP) information and propaganda affairs department, said Taiwan's
politics, distorted by a wrongly-designed electoral system which has
spawned ethnic political affiliations and biased governmental
policies, have been a block, rather than a boost, to the development
of the domestic economy.</P>
      <P>Chen said Ma is not just popular in northern Taiwan, he is also
popular in southern Taiwan where the pro-independence DPP enjoys
absolute support, making him "the only chance in Taiwan to challenge
ethnocentric politics."</P>
      <P>A charismatic media guru who won the Dec. 1 legislative elections
with flying colors, Chen criticized Taiwan's defective electoral
system, under which she said candidates can be elected even though
they obtain the support of less than half of the voters.</P>
      <P>Chen also said that the whole of Taiwan has been in a political
struggle at the cost of its economy since 1995, leading to the
erosion of the country's international competitiveness.</P>
      <P>Citing Sony as an example, she said the Japanese electronics
giant planned to invest some US$291 million in Taiwan to develop
broad-band telecommunications systems around the island. The plan,
however, was halted after Sony became spooked by the difficulties and
complexities of administrative barriers from city and county
governments for approval.</P>
      <P>Also on Thursday, Chen called on Legislative Yuan President Wang
Jin-pyng, a Kuomintang stalwart, and expressed her support for Wang
in his bid to be reelected.</P>
      <P>Chen urged Wang, who was reelected as a legislator in the Dec. 1
elections with overwhelming support in the southern port city of
Kaohsiung, to advocate revamping the electoral system after the new
legislature convenes in February.</P>
      <P>She said to revamp the defective electoral system, Taiwan should
adopt a single-member constituency and should use the system where
each voter should be entitled to cast two votes -- one for a district
candidate and one for a political party.</P>

(By David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Hong Kong media tycoon Jimmy Lai plans to
bring another of his maverick publications, the Apple Daily
newspaper, to Taiwan, according to a report carried in the Tuesday
issue of the Asian Wall Street Journal (AWSJ).</P>
      <P>Lai told the AWSJ in a recent interview that the launch of the
Taiwan version of the successful Hong Kong daily could come as soon
as late next year and could cost "up to NT$5 billion (US$145.3
million)."</P>
      <P>The new newspaper would join the Taiwan version of Lai's Next
Magazine, the glossy weekly launched in May, which Lai said he
expects to break even "in the next four months -- six months at the
latest."</P>
      <P>"We're going to launch our newspaper hopefully by the end of next
year," Lai said. "The only thing holding us back now is we want to
make money from Next Magazine before we start another new venture."</P>
      <P>The AWSJ report said Lai, who relocated to Taiwan last year, has
set his sights on expanding in what is already a very crowded media
market.</P>
      <P>In Lai's view, the report said, there is still room in Taiwan for
his trademark formula of sex, gossip and muckraking investigative
reports.</P>
      <P>"You need a consumer newspaper here," Lai said. "The media here
has long neglected the needs of the market."</P>
      <P>The circulation of Next Magazine's Taiwan edition has fallen to
under 200,000 copies in recent weeks from the sold-out run of 275,000
for the first edition, but even at that it still boasts three times
the circulation of its closest competitor, Lai said, adding that the
planned Taiwan version of Apple Daily is aimed at tapping a similar
vein of demand.

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Thursday his
administration will finalize a long-term human rights promotion plan
by 2003.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks at a meeting of the human rights
advisory task force under the Presidential Office. The panel, founded
in October 2000, is headed by Vice President Annette Lu.</P>
      <P>The president said a draft bill governing the establishment of a
national human rights commission will be referred to the Legislative
Yuan for deliberation and approval in the near future.</P>
      <P>In addition, Chen said, the government is drafting a human
rights code to protect basic human rights.</P>
      <P>Starting next year, Chen said, the government will issue a human
rights white paper and a national human rights report annually. The
white paper will detail the government's human rights policy, while
the human rights report will review the country's human rights
conditions.</P>
      <P>In 2003, Chen said, the government will unveil a package of
action guidelines for human rights promotion.</P>
      <P>"By then, we'll have a comprehensive plan and mechanism to
protect human rights to meet the requirements of a world human
rights convention held in Vienna in 1993," Chen noted.</P>
      <P>He said the government's efforts to promote human rights have
received increasing recognition of international human rights
promotional groups and major countries around the world.</P>
      <P>Many international human rights associations have sent
representatives to Taiwan to see for themselves Taiwan's progress in
human rights protection over the past two years, Chen said, adding
that a prestigious magazine published by Harvard University has
decided to publish a series of articles detailing the development of
human rights in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>With the concerted efforts of the human rights advisory

and the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The four said that before their trip to Beijing, they will first
meet with officials of the Republic of China's Mainland Affairs
Council to obtain their "understanding." ROC public servants can only
visit mainland China after gaining the permission of the government.</P>
      <P>PFP Chairman James Soong said Wednesday that it is quite natural
that lawmakers visit mainland China for the welfare of Taiwan people,
however, he urged them to maintain the dignity of the ROC in their
negotiations with Beijing.</P>
      <P>Outgoing legislator Elmer Fung, who is familiar with affairs
related to cross-strait exchanges, has also been invited by Beijing
to visit the mainland.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SOCIETY WANTS U.S. MEMORIAL TO JAPANESE AGGRESSION AGAINST CHINESE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Dec.  5  (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung and Ed Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An academic society wants to build a
memorial in Washington, D.C. to Chinese victims of Japanese
aggression during World War II, a spokesman for the group said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The issue will be discussed at the seventh international academic
seminar on Sino-Japanese relations to be held in Washington D.C. Dec.
7-9, a spokesman for one of the sponsors of the event, the Society
for the Study of Japanese Aggression against China, said.</P>
      <P>The spokesman said that the University of Maryland and the
Rochester Institute of Technology will also sponsor the three-day
discussions.</P>
      <P>The society wants to construct the memorial in Washington
commemorating the Japanese aggression against China as soon as it
can, said Wu Tien-wei, professor emeritus of history at Southern
Illinois University and founder of the society.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the establishment of a memorial would be to
educate the American people of how the Japanese imperial armed forces
slaughtered more than 35 million Chinese people during World War II.
Their atrocities were far crueler than Nazi Germany's efforts to
eradicate the Jews, Wu said.</P>
      <P>"Those of us who have experienced Japanese aggression against
China during World War II first hand should make every effort to
accomplish this mission -- this is our responsibility," Wu said.</P>
      <P>Richard Chu, president of the society and professor of history at
the Rochester Institute of Technology, said that more than 100
scholars from Taiwan, mainland China, Canada, Hungary, Italy, Japan,
South Korea and the United States will take part in the discussions.</P>
      <P>Chu said he regretted that several renowned Japanese scholars who
attended the last gathering will be absent this time.</P>
      <P>This will be the second time that the meeting will be held in the
United States, Chu said.</P>
      <P>Mrs. Anna Chennault, honorary chairman of the proposed memorial
organizing committee, said that the task ahead is not easy. "However,
we will do our best to accomplish it," she said.</P>
      <P>The first seminar on Sino-Japanese relations was held in August
1990 in Hong Kong. The meetings were subsequently held in Beijing,
Taipei, Tokyo, Zhangzhun, and San Francisco.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT, PFP SAY THEY WILL NOT JOIN PRESIDENT'S ALLIANCE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  6  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The leaders of the opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) and People First Party (PFP) said Thursday they will not join
any "unconstitutional" ruling coalition and will not support any of
their party members serving in the Cabinet.</P>
      <P>KMT Chairman Lien Chan and PFP Chairman James Soong told a joint
news conference after hours of talks that they will respect the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)'s right to assemble a
Cabinet after it emerged from last weekend's elections as the biggest
party in the legislature.</P>
      <P>However, they went on, neither the KMT nor the PFP will join the
"national stabilization alliance" advocated by President Chen
Shui-bian or any similar organizations not based on the Constitution.</P>
      <P>In a statement released at the news conference, they said they
will neither encourage nor support any party member wishing to serve
in the Cabinet.</P>
      <P>Noting that according to the underlying principles of democracy,
rulers should be held accountable for their policies, the two leaders
said the DPP should not try to shift responsibility for the
consequences of its policies in regard to domestic affairs,
diplomacy, the economy and relations with mainland China.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile the KMT and PFP will do their utmost to serve as
responsible opposition parties by monitoring the government in line
with the public's desire for economic development, harmony among
people of various ethnic origins and peace with mainland China.</P>
      <P>They said their parties share similar political ideas and
policies on vital issues and will make decisions through the due
process of their own parties.</P>
      <P>They also said they had decided to set up an opinion-exchange
mechanism to coordinate their parties' stances on major national
policies.</P>
      <P>Soong asked the public not to brand the two parties as an
umbrella pro-reunification group, adding that any attempt to divide
the island's political movements into pro-reunification and
pro-independence is a dangerous simplification and will not serve the
best interests of the nation.</P>
      <P>He said the KMT and PFP share common positions on basic issues
and that they would keep a watchful eye on the DPP government to
ensure it is run on the basis of the Republic of China Constitution.</P>
      <P>Their refusal to join the ruling coalition will also provide
voters with another option in the next elections, Soong added.</P>
      <P>He argued that a coalition such as Chen's proposed "national
stabilization alliance" would obliterate the differences between the
parties involved. Since they would have to share the responsibility
of the government's rule, this would strip the public of the choice
to punish a ruling party they dislike in elections by voting against
them, he claimed.</P>
      <P>He further admitted that he had exchanged views with Lien about
who will be their choice for the next president of the Legislative
Yuan.</P>
      <P>Although he stopped short of endorsing incumbent KMT Legislative
Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng's bid for re-election, he said that his
party will not seek either the presidency or the vice presidency, but
instead will throw its weight behind another party's candidate who is
acceptable to the PFP.</P>
      <P>Lien said at the news conference that he had already recommended
Wang to KMT lawmakers and the public as the party's candidate for
chief of the Legislative Yuan and that the party will seek the
support of other parties for Wang's candidacy.</P>
      <P>The KMT and PFP, which control 114 seats between them in the
225-seat legislature, technically can elect anyone of their choice as
legislative president if they can agree on a candidate.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FAMILY IN BABY SWAP CASE PETITION COURT FOR RETURN OF DAUGHTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 6 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Taiwan couple went to the Taoyuan District
Court recently to seek official confirmation that they were given the
wrong baby when the woman gave birth nine years ago at a local
hospital.</P>
      <P>The mistake only became apparent in March this year when the
father, identified only by his surname Huang, applied for an ID card
for his daughter and took her for a routine test to ascertain her
blood type. The test results showed that the girl has type A blood,
while both parents have type O -- a biological impossibility.</P>
      <P>Upon further investigation, they found that another woman,
surnamed Liang, had given birth to a daughter at the same hospital
and at almost the same time as Huang's wife.</P>
      <P>The Huang couple then visited the Liangs and saw that their
daughter bears a close resemblance to the Huangs, whereupon they
demanded a DNA test that confirmed that the two couples had been
given the wrong babies nine years ago.</P>
      <P>Despite the Huangs' demand for the return of their daughter, the
court's decision was uncertain, as court officials said the judge
would also take into consideration the fact that neither girl is
willing to leave the people they consider to be their parents and go
to live with total strangers.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the owner of the hospital claimed that he could not
track down the nurses responsible for the mistake, but added that he
would serve as a coordinator until the two families resolve the
issue.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The British electronics industry, touted to
be the biggest semiconductor designer in Europe, sought partnerships
with their Taiwan counterparts Thursday at a symposium in Hsinchu,
the capital of Taiwan's semiconductor industry.</P>
      <P>The symposium, jointly sponsored by a British alliance for the
development of system-on-a-chip technology, the Semiconductor
Business Association (SBA) of the United Kingdom and Taiwan's
Industrial Technology Research Institute, was aimed at promoting
cooperation between the two countries.</P>
      <P>Some 120 executives from local semiconductor firms attended the
gathering to listen to briefings on Britain's electronic industry and
especially its semiconductor design industry.</P>
      <P>SBA President Chris McArdle said Taiwan, which is the world's
fourth-biggest semiconductor producer, would be the perfect partner
for Britain, which is good at semiconductor design and the European
leader in the development of the third-generation telephones.</P>
      <P>McArdle said that his country accounts for half of Europe's
production of semiconductor components and that 70 percent of
Europe-made mobile phones contain British-made components.</P>
      <P>Although the current recession has bitten into the profits of the
semiconductor industry around the world, British industry is still
pouring funds into the development of the third-generation mobile
phone and is ready to take off once the world economy recovers.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan is home to the world's best manufacturers for
firms that outsource their chip production, McArdle said that many
British firms are farming out their orders to Taiwan producers and
that this trend is growing.</P>
      <P>He predicted that Taiwan will not lose this edge to mainland
China, which he described as a hard market to penetrate, despite its

magistrates-elect and legislators-elect of the offshore islands of
Kinmen and Matsu to visit some mainland Chinese cities from Dec. 9.</P>
      <P>The four are Lee Chu-feng, magistrate-elect of Kinmen; Wu

      <P>Taipei City Mayor Ma Ying-jeou denied
Wednesday that he is weighing the possibility of uniting local
government heads of opposition parties into a political alliance.</P>
      <P>The opposition Kuomintang's (KMT's) highest-ranking elected

magistrates-elect should be invited to join the weekly meeting of the

Taoyuan and Taipei, but stressed that they did not discuss the idea

      <P>The Taipei mayor said the Taipei city government can ill-afford
not to cooperate with neighboring counties, since many people working
in Taipei live in nearby counties, but added that such cooperation is

    <HEADLINE>ROC'S MAINLAND CHINA POLICIES REMAIN UNCHANGED: PREMIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  7 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung said Friday that
the Republic of China government's mainland China policies remain
unchanged in the wake of the Dec. 1 legislative and local elections.</P>
      <P>Fielding questions during an interpellation session at the
Legislative Yuan, Chang said President Chen Shui-bian made explicitly
clear his administration's mainland China policies in his inaugural
speech last year and on many other prominent occasions, adding that
the policies are not going to be changed because of the results of
the elections held last weekend.</P>
      <P>Chang made the remarks in response to a question by opposition
Kuomintang Legislator Kao Yu-jen, who asked Chang what exactly the
Chen administration's mainland China policies are, given that Chen
has disavowed the existence of the "92 consensus" in recent months
even though he had vowed in his inaugural speech that the leadership
on the two sides of the Taiwan Strait should jointly seek a
resolution to the "one China" issue on the "existing basis."</P>
      <P>The premier responded to Kao's question by saying that President
Chen has made it very clear that officials from the two sides can
"sit down and talk" anytime and anywhere about differences or
questions across the Taiwan Strait, including discussing the "one
China" policy or anything concerning the so-called "92 consensus."</P>
      <P>He continued by saying that negotiators from both sides did not
reach any "consensus" in their landmark talks in 1992, pointing out
that the only "consensus" the two sides reached that year was that
political cross-strait disputes should be shelved while both sides
continue expanding bilateral cross-strait exchanges.</P>
      <P>Basically, Chang said, the so-called "92 consensus" is nothing
but "each side telling a different story."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chang noted that the government would be pleased to
welcome visits to Beijing by a newly-elected magistrate and several
legislators at the invitation of the mainland Chinese authorities "so
long as their visits do not run counter to the existing regulations
and as long as national dignity is upheld."</P>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen, who was
also present at the Legislative Yuan interpellation session, declined
to comment on the proposed visits, saying only that a further
understanding of the details surrounding such an invitation is needed
before the MAC can comment on the matter.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ECONOMICS MINISTER CALLS FOR CLOSER ROC-JAPANESE EXCHANGES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  Taiwan, Dec. 7 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Economic Affairs Lin
Hsin-yi said Friday the Republic of China and Japan should further
strengthen bilateral economic exchanges and cooperation for mutual
benefits.</P>
      <P>Addressing the opening session of an annual ROC-Japan economic
cooperation conference, Lin said that thanks to geographic proximity
and historical tradition, the ROC and Japan have maintained
longstanding close economic ties.</P>
      <P>"And the annual East-Asian Economic Conference has served as a
major conduit for bridging gaps, mending differences and boosting
bilateral trade and economic cooperation," Lin said.</P>
      <P>Quoting official tallies, Lin said Japan is Taiwan's second
largest trading partner after the United States as well as the
island's top import source and third biggest export outlet.
Meanwhile, Taiwan is Japan's second largest export market and
No. 4 import source.</P>
      <P>Due to structural and technical differences, Lin said, Taiwan
has suffered chronic trade deficits with Japan. In the first 10
months of this year, Taiwan registered a US$11.3 billion trade
deficit with Japan.</P>
      <P>"Although the amount marked a 40.8 percent decline from the
year-earlier level, there is still ample room for the two sides to
improve their trade imbalance," Lin said.</P>
      <P>The minister went on to say that Japan has been Taiwan's second
largest source of foreign capital and technical know-how. Despite
the linger global economic downturn, Lin said, Japanese investors
have continued swarming to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"In the January-October period of this year, Japanese investment
in Taiwan recorded a 20 percent gain from the year-earlier level,"
Lin said, adding that the rise indicates the closeness of
ROC-Japanese economic relations.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan's general economic and investment climate
will become even more liberal and transparent following its entry to
the World Trade Organization (WTO) at the beginning of next year,
Lin said Japanese investors are welcome to invest more in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"We look forward to seeing Taiwan-Japanese trade, investment
and technical cooperation increase further after our WTO accession,"
Lin said, adding he hopes Taiwan and Japanese business groups
cooperate closely in expanding their niches in the Asia-Pacific
and global markets.</P>
      <P>More than 300 senior business and industry executives from the
two countries attended the meeting, co-sponsored by the East-Asia
Economic Conference's ROC Committee and Japanese Committee.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAGISTRATE-ELECT AND LEGISLATOR-ELECT NOT READY TO VISIT M'LAND</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kinmen,  Dec.  7  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Kinmen magistrate-elect Lee Chu-feng said
Friday that he is unlikely to visit Beijing shortly as invited by
mainland China's State Council since he cannot have his "certificate
of Taiwan residency" document renewed in time.</P>
      <P>Lee, a candidate fielded by the opposition, pro-unification New
Party in the just-concluded legislative and local elections and
elected magistrate of the offshore county of Kinmen, said he will
certainly make the trip after he is sworn in to office later this
month.</P>
      <P>Wu Cheng-tien, another Kinmen-based New Party member who was
elected to the Legislative Yuan Dec. 1 and who was also invited
recently by the Taiwan Affairs Office of mainland China's State
Council, said he would keep his itinerary synchronous with Lee's.</P>
      <P>Lee and Wu went to the Kinmen County Council Friday to express
their appreciation for the support that the local council gave them
during the elections.</P>
      <P>Lee said he would like to visit mainland China when his entry
papers are ready and on the condition that the Republic of China's
sovereign dignity is fully upheld.</P>
      <P>If he does visit Beijing, Lee said, he would like to meet with
mainland Chinese officials to further tackle technical cross-strait
issues, such as the interests of mainland Chinese brides living in
Kinmen and other ROC-held areas, a simplification of entrance and
exit procedures for elderly retired ROC servicemen who are originally
from mainland China, and the opening of regular passenger flights
across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Lee and Wu, as well as Chen Hsueh-sheng, magistrate-elect of the
outlying island of Matsu, and Tsao Yuan-chang, legislator-elect of
Matsu, both of whom belong to the opposition People First Party, were
reportedly invited by Beijing to visit mainland China beginning Dec.
9.</P>
      <P>During the quartet's proposed visit in mainland China, they are
expected to discuss with mainland officials matters concerning the
"three mini links" -- direct trade, postal and shipping links between
the ROC-held frontline islands of Kinmen and Matsu and the mainland
Chinese ports of Xiamen and Fuzhou in Fujian Province -- which ROC
authorities implemented at the start of January this year.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the proposed visits to mainland China by the four
newly elected, Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) officials
said Friday that cross-strait negotiations on matters involving
public and governmental authorization, such as the "mini three links"
issue, is the Executive Yuan's right and responsibility.</P>
      <P>The MAC officials said they believe that the individuals
concerned must understand their position and respect the rights and
obligations of the MAC.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  7 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's top election official said Friday
that there is no question about the validity of Taichung County
candidate Yen Ching-piao's election as legislator and that he will
receive his election certificate next week.</P>
      <P>Huang Shih-cheng, chairman of the Central Election Commission
(CEC), said Yen's election as a legislator is an undeniable fact, but
whether he will be allowed to be sworn in and implement his rights
and duties as a legislator is another question.</P>
      <P>Yen is currently in police detention and prosecutors are seeking
a 20-year sentence for embezzlement, corruption and attempted murder,
which means he is unable to attend the legislative swearing-in
ceremony.</P>
      <P>Huang noted that if Yen could be released on bail or judged not
guilty, it would be possible for him to be sworn in publicly and
retroactively, enabling him to undertake his duties as a lawmaker.</P>
      <P>The legislative session, which starts Feb. 1, will last for three
years and Huang pointed out that Yen can be sworn in at any point
within the three-year period.</P>
      <P>He continued that for the CEC's part, the commission will present
Yen with his election certificate as scheduled, but will leave the
issue of how he can take his oath of office and start his legislative
duties to the Legislative Yuan to solve.</P>
      <P>His comments followed reports that Yen, chairman of the lucrative
Chenlankung Temple in central Taiwan, will not be allowed to take the
oath in prison and consequently, will not be able to start his
legislative duties.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN-HK AVIATION PACT ISSUE TO BE SETTLED BY YEAR'S END: MAC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  7 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC) affirmed Friday that the dust raised by a spat over the
expiration of a Taiwan-Hong Kong aviation accord will settle by the
end of this year.</P>
      <P>MAC Vice Chairman John C. Teng made the assurance in response to
a newspaper report that air traffic between Taiwan and Hong Kong may
be disrupted when the bilateral aviation accord expires at the end of
the year.</P>
      <P>According to the report, the mainland Chinese authorities may
decide against extending the pact in order to force Taiwan back to
the negotiating table on Beijing's terms.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a routine MAC news conference, Teng said the report
was pessimistic and exaggerated.</P>
      <P>"The reality is that consultations and negotiations over the
accord have been proceeding continuously," Teng said, refusing to
divulge any details concerning the negotiations.</P>
      <P>MAC Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen said during a tea party with local
journalists earlier this week that issues regarding the Taiwan-Hong
Kong aviation accord are being addressed and that the dust will
settle before the end of December.</P>
      <P>Under the current Taiwan-Hong Kong aviation pact signed in 1996,
the two sides should review the agreement once every five years.</P>
      <P>When the pact expired June 12 this year, the two sides failed to
meet to review the accord. Nevertheless, they agreed to extend the
validity of the accord until the end of this year.</P>
      <P>Although the new expiry date is drawing near, sources close to
the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA), which is responsible for
arranging technical details for bilateral talks, said late last month
that the agency had not received any notice to prepare for the talks.</P>
      <P>Since Hong Kong reverted to mainland China's rule in July 1997,
the MAC, which charts Taiwan's policy toward mainland China, has
taken charge of issues related to Hong Kong, including civil aviation
affairs.</P>
      <P>Airline sources said the MAC's insistence on participating in
talks may be a hindrance to the opening of negotiations. In the past,
Taiwan and Hong Kong carriers operating the route reportedly played a
leading role in the negotiations.</P>
      <P>Some sources said mainland China's disapproval of any official
Taiwan-Hong Kong contact may be the biggest obstacle to the opening
of aviation talks.</P>
      <P>A local newspaper said Friday that Beijing is considering
instructing Hong Kong airlines not to extend the current pact with
their Taiwan counterparts in order to prevent Taiwan from stalling
the negotiations any further.</P>
      <P>Should that be the case, the paper said, airlines from both sides
would have to maintain Taiwan-Hong Kong flight services with
chartered planes starting next year.</P>
      <P>At present, Taiwan and Hong Kong are each allowed to operate 121
flights between the two destinations per week. Of Taiwan's quota,
China Airlines (CAL) accounts for 105 flights and EVA Airways can
only operate the remaining 16 flights.</P>
      <P>On the Hong Kong side, Cathay Pacific Airways accounts for 100
flights and Dragonair is allowed to operate 21 flights. Both EVA and
Dragonair hope that the aviation accord can be revised to offer them
additional quotas, as the demand for Taiwan-Hong Kong flight services
has continued to rise, despite the current economic downturn.</P>
      <P>Now that Taiwan has eased restrictions on mainland China-bound
investment, airline sources said, more Taiwan businessmen intend to
travel to the mainland via Hong Kong for market-inspection tours,
pushing up demand for additional flights.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN UNLIKELY TO FACE FINANCIAL CRISIS: ECONOMIC PLANNING OFFICIALS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  7  (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan is unlikely to face a currency or
banking crisis but should still continue to speed up financial reform
to prevent such possibilities from becoming reality, officials at
Taiwan's top economic planning agency said Friday.</P>
      <P>According to officials at the Overall Planning Department under
the Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD), Taiwan's
foreign reserves as of the end of October were as high as US$116.2
billion. These, combined with a managed floating exchange rate
system, make the probability of a currency crisis remote, the CEPD
predicted.</P>
      <P>The officials added that the government has been improving the
island's financial climate since the beginning of the year by setting
up a financial rehabilitation fund, resolving non-performing loans at
grassroots financial institutions, promoting bank mergers, ratifying
major finance laws and allowing the establishment of financial
holding companies.</P>
      <P>Citing a study on the history of financial crises by Harvard
University economics professor Robert Barro, the CEPD officials said
that although the short-term effects of a financial crisis would be
significant, a nation's economic growth in the long run eventually
depends on economic fundamentals.</P>
      <P>According to Barro's study, each time a currency crisis occurred
between 1980 and 2000, GDP growth decreased by 1.3 percentage points
and each time a banking crisis occurred, the GDP would go down by 0.6
percentage points.</P>

Taiwan's democratization and to world peace.</P>
      <P>Lu, who is the first female winner of the World Peace Prize since
the inauguration of the award in 1990, has said that the prize, which
will be presented Monday, should be considered an award for "the

    <TEXT>
      <P>The number of Taiwan people infected with
HIV, the virus that causes deadly AIDS, had exceeded 3,500 as of the
end of November, the Center for Disease Control (CDC) under the
Department of Health said Friday.</P>
      <P>CDC officials noted that HIV carriers have been found in nearly
every walk of life, with military servicemen, civil servants and
teaching faculty accounting for about 10 percent of all HIV carriers
and housewives accounting for 40 percent of female HIV carriers.</P>
      <P>"Eight doctors and five nurses are also on the list of Taiwan's
HIV carriers," CDC Deputy Director Chiang Ying-lung said, adding that
four of the doctors and two of the nurses have already died from
AIDS.</P>
      <P>Chiang added that as none of the HIV-positive medical personnel
work or worked in the surgical department, they would be unlikely to
transmit the killer virus to their patients and he pointed out that
the 13 infected medical professionals form a tiny proportion of the
country's HIV carriers.</P>
      <P>Chiang said the CDC was informed a few months ago that a male
homosexual doctor had tested HIV-positive.</P>
      <P>Under existing laws, he went on, the carrier's personal data
should have been kept secret. "It is regrettable that the information
was leaked," Chiang said, adding that the doctor's right to work must
be protected in accordance with the law.</P>
      <P>In foreign countries, he noted, the work rights of HIV-infected
doctors are carefully protected and the decision as to whether such
doctors should be allowed contact with the public in a professional
capacity should depend on each individual situation.</P>
      <P>"If they are surgeons, foreign hospitals usually reassign them to
departments that maintain no direct contacts with patients," he
explained.</P>
      <P>According to CDC tallies, civil servants make up 2.4 percent of
Taiwan's 3,500-plus HIV carriers, military servicemen account for 5.3
percent, and professionals in various fields, including teachers and
medical personnel account for 4.6 percent.</P>
      <P>Homemakers make up 40 percent of the more than 200 female local
HIV carriers, CDC officials said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FINANCE MINISTRY PREDICTS RESUMPTION OF POSITIVE EXPORT GROWTH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  7  (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Finance predicted Friday
that the island's export trading should be able to resume positive
growth after April 2002.</P>
      <P>According to the ministry's latest customs figures, November
exports were down 33.5 percent from the same month last year, while
imports were down 19.7 percent. However, officials said that November
exports totaled US$10.19 billion -- the second consecutive month that
the figure has stayed above US$10 billion -- indicating a gradual
return to stable growth.</P>
      <P>With November imports totaling US$7.95 billion, the island had a
trade surplus of US$2.24 billion, continuing the trend since March
2000 that each month has ended with a trade surplus.</P>
      <P>Finance officials said that the primary reason for the drop in
November imports and exports was the relatively high basis for
comparison from last year.</P>
      <P>The ministry predicted that annual exports for 2001 would face a
contraction of 16.7 percent, while annual imports would drop by 23.1
percent. Trade surplus this year would total US$15.7 billion, a
record high since 1988, and 89 percent higher than last year.</P>
      <P>Officials said that Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on America have
delayed a global economic recovery, citing the latest forecast
figures from the WEFA Group -- a U.S. economic research and
consulting company that was founded as Wharton Econometric
Forecasting Associates.</P>
      <P>According to WEFA economists, global economic growth this year
will drop from last year's 4 percent to 1.3 percent and is likely to
see a small improvement to 1.7 percent in 2002.</P>
      <P>However, ministry officials were optimistic that a gradual
elimination of uncertainty factors from the U.S. war on the Taliban
regime in Afghanistan combined with an expected increase in trading
between Taiwan and mainland China after the two sides enter the World
Trade Organization will help the island expand its export trading.</P>
      <P>Domestically, officials said that financial and economic reforms
are expected to improve the domestic investment and economic climate.</P>

    <DATELINE>Chiayi, Taiwan, Dec. 7 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A special birthday party was held at
the Sacred Heart Home in the southern Taiwan county of Chiayi Friday
for the facility's founder, Francis Borkhardt, a Swiss Catholic
father who will turn 101 years old Saturday.</P>
      <P>Father Borkhardt, a member of the Society of Jesus, has preached
his faith in Taiwan for 50 years. He founded the Sacred Heart Home in
the remote Chiayi county township of Tungshih in 1990 to provide care
for the seriously mentally disabled.</P>
      <P>The center is now home to more than 100 mentally challenged
persons. The Republic of China government offers less than NT$20,000
(US$579.71) in living subsidy to each mentally-challenged person per
month. Borkhardt has tried every possible means to raise funds to
help the home break even. The center needs at least NT$30 million
annually.</P>
      <P>In appreciation of Borkhardt's dedicated services, the Diocese of
Chiayi Catholic Bishop's Curia and the Sacred Heart Home jointly
organized a special party in celebration of his 101th birthday.</P>
      <P>More than a dozen mentally-challenged residents in the home
performed many pieces of beautiful music with various kinds of
traditional and alternative instruments.</P>
      <P>"This is the most pleasing and memorable music I have ever
heard," an excited Borkhardt said, adding that he is grateful for
assistance he has received from a number of people in operating the
Sacred Heart Home.</P>
      <P>Borkhardt said he hopes that he can build a permanent home for
elderly and orphaned mentally-challenged residents at the Sacred
Heart Home during the rest of his life.</P>
      <P>The Swiss clergyman has devoted the prime of his life to serving
local people over the past five decades. Borkhardt, who can speak
fluent Mandarin Chinese and Taiwanese, said he has integrated himself
into Taiwan society and life.</P>
      <P>In appreciation of his dedicated services, President Chen
Shui-bian decorated Borkhardt with the Order of Brilliant Star with
Grand Cordon on his centennial birthday last year. The Order is the
highest honor the ROC presents to foreign nationals who have
contributed to Taiwan's educational and charity services.</P>
      <P>The Holy See also presented a grand cross gold medal to Borkhardt
in March this year in recognition of his contribution to Catholic
Church.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Friday that
the government is planning to set up a national human rights memorial
hall.</P>
      <P>Chen said that the hall will serve as both a memorial hall and a
museum, the main purpose of which will be to provide education on
constitutional universal human rights.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks while speaking at the opening ceremony of an
exhibition on Taiwan's democratic human rights held at the
Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>The exhibition is being jointly sponsored by the Cabinet-level
Council for Cultural Affairs, the Government Information Office (GIO)
and the 228 Memorial Foundation.</P>
      <P>In order to emphasize the importance of human rights, Chen said
that his administration has upgraded Taiwan's human rights policy to
the same status as international human rights, which means that a
proposed national human rights committee will be set up in accordance
with the standards set by the United Nations.</P>
      <P>Chen said the government will ratify the international
conventions on civil and political rights and on social and cultural
rights. He added that it will also strengthen international human

      <P>December marks the 53rd anniversary of the world human rights
declaration and the second International Human Rights Day of the new

      <P>Chinese will outrank English to become the
most widely used Internet language by 2007, according to a Financial
Times report Friday.</P>
      <P>The Financial Times quoted a United Nations' Internet seminar
report as saying that presently English is still the most widely used
language on the Internet.</P>
      <P>However, it went on, along with the generalization of the
Internet, the situation has changed rapidly.</P>
      <P>The newspaper also quoted the World Intellectual Property
Organization (WIPO) as saying that as early as next year, most
Internet surfers will be of a mother tongue other than English as the
language circulating on the Internet and by 2003 one-third of
Internet surfers will use another language on the Internet.</P>
      <P>It said that although languages used on the Internet have been
pluralized, until now the language used to make Web site
registrations has been still limited to those belonging to
Latin-rooted languages, including English.</P>
      <P>However, new technology will make non-Latin-rooted languages such
as Chinese, Japanese, Russian and Arabic possible to be languages
that are suitable for Web site registrations, the newspaper said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC LEGISLATURE WILL HAVE NEW SCENE, NEW STYLE: VICE PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 7 (CNA)
(By Sofia wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu said Friday she is
convinced that the Republic of China's often unruly legislature will
have a new feel and new style with the entry of 50 female lawmakers
early next year.</P>
      <P>A jubilant Lu made the forecast while meeting with Alice
Schwarzer, founder of the German magazine EMMA, and senior editors of
the publication.</P>
      <P>Lu, an outspoken democracy and human rights activist and
feminist, told her guests that she is very pleased to see 50 ROC
women emerge as victors in the hotly contested legislative elections
Dec. 1.</P>
      <P>"Some of them are incumbents and others are newcomers. They are
all elite members in various professional fields, and many of them
are young, pretty and well-mannered," Lu said. "I believe that after
they are sworn in next February, our Legislative Yuan will have a new
scene and new working style."</P>
      <P>When she launched a women's rights movement in Taiwan 30 years
ago, Lu said, few Taiwan women participated in politics. Worse yet,
she said, Taiwan women were facing various sorts of discrimination
and even political persecution.</P>
      <P>With the concerted efforts of women's rights groups and the
government, Lu said, Taiwan has made progress in protecting women's
rights and removal of gender inequalities.</P>
      <P>"Of course, there is still ample room for Taiwan to upgrade
women's status and promote women's rights," Lu said, adding that she
feels that the women's rights movement should be associated with
politics to facilitate realization of its cause.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, Lu met with a delegation of overseas Chinese
medical professionals to exchange views on promoting Taiwan's bid to
join the World Health Organization (WHO) as an observer.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan will become a full member of the World Trade
Organization Jan. 1, 2002 after a 12-year struggle, Lu said joining
the WHO should be the ROC's next diplomatic target.</P>
      <P>"All of our people at home and abroad should make concerted
efforts to realize this goal as early as possible," Lu said, adding
that the U.S. Congress has passed a resolution supporting the ROC's
WHO bid. "We should now seek the support of the U.S. executive
branch."</P>
      <P>In her view, Lu said, Taiwan should stop complaining about
mainland China's obstruction to its WHO bid and should instead tell
the world what it can do for the international community in medical
and health services as well as in humanitarian aid and relief work.</P>
      <P>Lu also urged her guests to lobby countries of their residence to
support the ROC's WHO bid.</P>

      <P>A government spokesman said Friday that it
was unfair to describe Taiwan's human rights record as being "so
tragic that one cannot bear to look at it" simply based on a local
opinion survey that gave non-passing grades in nine out of 10 areas.</P>
      <P>Government Information Office Director-General Su Tzen-ping said
that respected human rights organizations around the world usually
use actual incidents of human rights violations and not approval
ratings to determine the state of progress for any particular
country's human rights conditions.</P>
      <P>Su said that the study conducted by the Chinese Association for
Human Rights is at most an approval rating survey with scores handed
out by some experts and scholars based on their opinions, and not a
"human rights index report" as the association called it.</P>
      <P>Although the government "humbly accepts" the report for its
reference value, Su continued, the government had to respond to the
description put forth by the association's president, Chai Sung-lin,
to prevent the report from misleading the public.</P>
      <P>According to the association's survey, which was released only
days ahead of International Human Rights Day on Dec. 10, Taiwan's
human rights progress is considered unacceptable in such categories
as political human rights, economic human rights, judicial human
rights, environmental human rights, human rights for women, human
rights for children, human rights for senior citizens, human rights
for laborers and human rights for handicapped citizens.</P>
      <P>Only the island's cultural and educational human rights received
a passing mark in the study, which was conducted through surveys on

    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  Dec. 7 (CNA)
(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The director of the Taiwan Institute for
Economic Research, Wu Rong-i, said in Kaohsiung Friday that Taiwan
should put more emphasis on developing the service sector as a way to
absorb more jobless workers.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks while giving a report at the 29th East Asian
Economic Conference which opened at the Kaohsiung Ambassador Hotel
with the participation of representatives from Japan and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Wu said that the service sector has been contributing a bigger
share to the island's economic growth, while the shares from the
agricultural and industrial sectors are on the decline.</P>
      <P>Under such a trend, he noted that the jobless rate tends to
increase.</P>
      <P>Coupled with the continuing economic sluggishness, Wu said that
Taiwan's unemployment rate this year was rising faster than other
countries.</P>
      <P>He said that the government should take effective steps to
improve the structure of the island's industries so that the service
sector can absorb more unemployed workers.</P>
      <P>The researcher also said that foreign trade has been playing a
very important role in Taiwan's economic development over the past
few decades.</P>
      <P>Facing the first negative growth rate in half a century this
year, he said that the government should realize and resolve the
bottleneck in economic development if it wants to take advantage when
the economy begins to pick up.</P>
      <P>Wu said that the government's attaching importance to the
development of a knowledge-based economy is correct thinking.</P>
      <P>As the ruling Democratic Progressive Party has now emerged as the
largest party after the Dec. 1 legislative elections, he said that it
will be helpful for the government to formulate financial and
monetary policies in the future.</P>
      <P>Talking about Taiwan's investment in mainland China, Wu said that
in the first 10 months of this year alone, Taiwan businessmen have
invested US$2.33 billion there, a figure almost equal to that made by
Taiwan investors in mainland China last year.</P>
      <P>Compared with the slowdown in domestic investment, he said that
the amount of investment in mainland China by Taiwan businessmen is

    <TEXT>
      <P>An oil price war between the state-run
Chinese Petroleum Corp. (CPC) and the privately run Formosa
Petrochemical Corp. (FPC) began Friday following the two major oil
suppliers on the island announcing prices cuts for their respective
oil products.</P>
      <P>The two companies announced Friday that beginning Saturday, they
would lower the price of gasoline by NT$1 and cut the price of diesel
by NT$0.5.</P>
      <P>The FPC, which is affiliated with the Formosa Plastics Group,
announced the price cuts in the afternoon. The CPC followed suit 90
minutes later.</P>
      <P>The CPC had dropped the price per liter for gasoline by NT$1 in
May 1991, a decrease of 5.5 percent at that time, CPC sources said,
adding that the NT$1 cut (4.81 percent) for its gasoline price this
time is the largest since May 1991.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has put into practice a law governing the management of
petroleum and complete liberalization for its oil market will come
into force after related rules for implementation of the law are
completed.</P>
      <P>Besides announcing meeting the FPC's cuts, the CPC has also
authorized all of its gas stations to set their own gasoline and
diesel prices depending on the market situation, making it possible
that the price cuts at some of its gas stations will be even more.</P>
      <P>The new prices for CPC oil products sold to its gas stations are
as follows:</P>
      <P>-- 98 octane unleaded gasoline, NT$19.4 per liter;</P>
      <P>-- 95 octane unleaded gasoline, NT$18.2 per liter;</P>
      <P>-- 92 octane unleaded gasoline, NT$17.1 per liter;</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian's "national
stabilization alliance" will be created, said ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) Secretary-General Wu Nai-jen Friday.</P>
      <P>Wu said that the decision will not be affected by the boycott by
Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan and People First Party (PFP)
Chairman James Soong.</P>
      <P>After meeting Dec. 5, Lien and Soong announced that the two
opposition parties would not join the proposed alliance, nor would
they join in the formation of a coalition government.</P>
      <P>Wu said that the DPP was still evaluating the effect of the
Lien-Soong statement, but stressed that the alliance would be created
no matter what.</P>
      <P>DPP spokesman Cheng Yun-peng said that the party's first choice
would be to conduct party-to-party discussions on the issue, but that
it was possible that individuals would be asked to join the alliance.</P>
      <P>In the Dec. 1 legislative elections, the DPP won 87 of the 225
seats in the Legislative Yuan, followed by the KMT with 68 seats, the
PFP with 46 seats, the Taiwan Solidarity Union with 13 seats, the New
Party with one seat and 10 seats going to independents.</P>
      <P>DPP legislative whip Tsai Huang-lang said that the ruling party
will not give up its plan to establish the alliance simply because
the KMT and the PFP do not wish to participate.</P>
      <P>He said that President Chen will explain his idea clearly and
sincerely to Lien and Soong, and added that the DPP will also try to
contact legislative groups from the opposition to try to get the
alliance started ahead of the new legislature taking over Feb. 1.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, DPP Chairman Frank Hsieh urged the KMT and the PFP to
reconsider their decisions on refusing to join the "national
stabilization alliance."</P>
      <P>On the proposal by some DPP members that President Chen
concurrently serve as party chairman, Hsieh said that he has no
thoughts on the issue, but noted that Chen has openly stated that he
would not participate in party affairs.</P>
      <P>Regarding legislative reforms, he said that they should be done
as early as possible.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP LAWMAKERS UNVEIL THREE-PHRASE REFORM PLAN FOR LEGISLATURE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  7  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) lawmakers unveiled a three-phrase program for reform of the
legislature at a news conference Friday and sought the endorsement of
other parties.</P>
      <P>The plan envisioned the revision of five statutes governing the
legislature's daily function in the first phrase, a switch to
single-seat constituencies and a cut by half of the number of
lawmakers in the second phrase, and the enactment of several bills
crafted to limit conflicts of interests by lawmakers in the third
phrase.</P>
      <P>The DPP whip at the legislature, Tsai Huang-lang, who presided
over the news conference, said his party hopes the first phrase of
the reform will be carried out by the current legislators before the
end of December.</P>
      <P>The second phrase, which is the soul of the whole plan, will be
left to the new legislators who are expected to gather for their
first session in February.</P>
      <P>Since any downsizing of the legislature and changes in the
electoral system entails the amendment of the Constitution -- a task
of the National Assembly -- the second phrase is expected to take
longer and hopefully be finished by Dec. 1 next year, Tsai said.</P>
      <P>The third phrase of the reform involving the legislation of bills
regulating lobbying, political parties, political contributions and
conflicts of interests by legislators will be acted on by the next
legislature during its second session, according to the DPP plan.</P>
      <P>Noting that polls have shown that 65 percent of people are
unhappy with the legislature's performance, Tsai said the DPP is
giving legislature reform the top priority of its legislative agenda.</P>
      <P>Although the reform has to go through legal red tape, Tsai said
his party, which will be the largest in the next legislature, will
press ahead with it, adding: "If you cannot stand the heat, get out
of the kitchen."</P>
      <P>However, DPP legislator Lee Wen-chung said at the news conference
that he doesn't foresee any serious challenges to the reform in the
legislature since the plan was not only the common campaign platform
of the DPP and the Taiwan Solidarity Union in the just-concluded
islandwide elections, but has also been endorsed by People First
Party's Secretary General Chung Jung-chi and 33 Kuomintang (KMT)
lawmakers.</P>
      <P>In a related development Thursday, a group of outgoing and
incoming legislators, including independent legislator-elect Sisy
Chen and outgoing KMT legislator Ding Shou-chung, called for the
introduction of a single-seat district system and balloting whereby
each person would cast two votes; one for a candidate, another for a
party.</P>
      <P>Ting claimed the current system that has voters in one
constituency return several representatives to the legislature is
susceptible to factionalism because it boosts the competition among
candidates of one party and lowers the number of votes needed to win
a seat.</P>
      <P>The system encourages candidates to attract the support of a
narrow sector instead of appealing to general middle-of-the-roaders,
because of the low threshold needed to be elected, Ting said.</P>
      <P>Sisy Chen prodded the current legislature, which will end its
current session at the end of January, to carry out the changes
immediately, saying that now is the time for politicians to vote with
the DPP without fearing reprisals from their own parties as 50 of the
225 incumbent lawmakers failed to be re-elected.</P>
      <P>The job can be done by simply revising the Public Officials
Election and Recall Law, Chen claimed.</P>
      <P>DPP lawmakers, however, denounced the calls as "inappropriate,"
on the grounds that the change in the electoral system would have a
serious impact on the political map and should not be done hastily in
the twilight of the outgoing legislature.</P>
      <P>DPP legislator Lee Wen-chung said changes in the electoral system
could not have the desired results without re-drawing the election
districts and revising related laws simultaneously.</P>
      <P>"It is better that such an important task be done by the new
legislature," Lee said.</P>
      <P>His views were shared by the Legislative Yuan President Wang
Jin-pyng who said consultation among various parties is needed to
ensure successful legislature reform. The current legislature is
unlikely to see the consultation begin before its term expires.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS TO VISIT MAINLAND CHINA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 8 (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A delegation of Taiwan police officials are
scheduled to begin a 12-day visit to mainland China on Monday as
members of a civilian law enforcement organization to carry out a
series of academic exchanges with the mainland's Police Society.</P>
      <P>Criminal Investigation and Prevention Association (CIPA) Chairman
Lu Yu-jun said that although the trip will be billed as a visit by a
civilian group following a similar trip by the mainland's Police
Society to Taiwan in July, issues concerning cross-Taiwan Strait
cooperation in apprehending criminals who escape to the mainland
might also be discussed.</P>
      <P>Lu, former director-general of the National Police Administration
(NPA), will lead the delegation, which will include NPA Criminal
Investigation Bureau Commissioner Cheng Ching-sung, Central Police
University Vice President Lo Yi-an and other high-ranking police
officials.</P>
      <P>Lu said that at present, cross-strait coordination in the pursuit
of fugitives who flee to mainland China mostly depends on the Red
Cross and on the semi-official organizations in charge of bilateral
relations -- Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation and the mainland's
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits.</P>
      <P>However, Lu continued, with a lack of direct communication
channels between law enforcement authorities on opposite sides of the
Taiwan Strait, criminals often choose to hide in mainland China,
adversely affecting the mainland's public security.</P>
      <P>Therefore, he said, the CIPA -- which serves as a semi-official
channel between Republic of China and foreign police authorities --
hopes to increase mutual understanding through academic exchanges
and, in the long run, carry on discussions related to bilateral
cooperation in law enforcement.</P>

      <P>Under the agreement, both sides will pursue technical cooperation

      <P>During his brief stay in Ottawa, Lin hosted a luncheon party for
ranking officials of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office, Canada,

    <HEADLINE>DGBAS, FINANCE MINISTRY SHOULD BE KEPT SEPARATE: FORMER DGBAS HEAD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 8 (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A former head of the Directorate General of
Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) said Saturday that the
accounting agency should be kept separate from the Ministry of
Finance in the ongoing effort to streamline the government.</P>
      <P>Wei Duan, who headed the Cabinet-level DGBAS from 1996 to 2000,
said at a meeting of the Chinese Statistical Association that the
government should not merge the two agencies for the mere sake of
streamlining but should take into consideration whether such a move
can strengthen the functions of the government and improve overall
government efficiency.</P>
      <P>Wei said that it would take time to build and experiment with a
new financial and statistical system, whereas the existing system has
already helped make Taiwan the world's fastest growing economy over
the past 50 years with an average annual economic growth rate of 8.1
percent.</P>
      <P>In terms of cost-effectiveness, Wei said, Taiwan's statistical
and accounting system should be praised for such an accomplishment.
Over the past several decades, government expenditures have taken up
only between 17 percent and 33 percent of the GDP, with total
expenditures currently at 23.2 percent of the GDP, 16 percent of
which is by the central government.</P>
      <P>Wei said that such a figure is 10-30 percentage points less than
what other countries spend in terms of their GDP.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Research, Development and Evaluation Commission
has established the goal of cutting one-third of the existing
government ministries and agencies so that only 21 will remain after
the first phase of the massive government streamlining project is
completed.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC REP. BRIEFS HUNGARIAN NEWS MEDIA ON POST-ELECTIONS SITUATION</HEADLINE>

(By Liu Hsing and David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China representative to
Hungary on Friday briefed Hungarian news media on the ROC's
post-elections situation.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a news conference, Rock J. Leng said that although
the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) candidate Chen Shui-bian won
the 2000 presidential election, the party has controlled fewer seats
in the Legislative Yuan than the opposition Kuomingtang (KMT) has,
causing some embarrassment to the DPP in its attempts to implement
government policy.</P>
      <P>However, he went on, the Dec. 1 legislative and local elections
have changed the situation, with the DPP winning the most seats in
the Legislature, which he said will make Taiwan's political situation
more stable.</P>
      <P>Leng said that the results of elections show that the people of
Taiwan have chosen stability and have identified Taiwan's stability
with their own personal prosperity.</P>
      <P>The sustained surge in Taiwan's stock market over the past week
demonstrates the positive reaction of the people of Taiwan, he said,
adding that after experiencing many democratic elections, the people
of Taiwan are more and more sure of themselves.</P>
      <P>The journalist-turned-diplomat also quoted President Chen
Shui-bian as saying that the ROC government will proceed with plans
to reform the Legislature, help the economy recover and promote
social welfare, as well as continue to work toward improving
cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>Leng indicated that although two-way trade between the ROC and
Hungary this year is lower than last year's level, Hungary is still
the ROC's largest trade partner in Eastern Europe.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SCHOLAR SEES DIFFICULTIES IN INTER-PARTY MERGER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  8  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>It's no easy task for Taiwan's major
political parties to merge among themselves under the current
electoral system, a scholar said Saturday at a seminar on the
island's political trends in the wake of the legislative elections.</P>
      <P>Hung Yung-tai, a political science professor at National Taiwan
University, said at the seminar, co-sponsored by an opposition
Kuomintang (KMT)-affiliated think tank and the Shanmeng (Mountain
Alliance) political group, that inter-party cooperation is not
equivalent to an inter-party merger.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan's present electoral system, which involves
single non-transferable votes in multi-member constituencies, is
conducive to the development of multiparty politics, Hung said the
chances of party mergers are slim, if not nil.</P>
      <P>"And even if party mergers do take place, they are very likely to
split again in a short period of time," Hung asserted.</P>
      <P>As to inter-party cooperation, Hung said the issue must be
addressed at two levels -- namely at the leadership level and at the
grassroots members and supporters level.</P>
      <P>In his view, Hung said, the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) and the four-month-old Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) are most
likely to cooperate because the TSU's spiritual leader -- former
President Lee Teng-hui -- can help mediate DPP-TSU cooperation at the
leadership level.
 And the other advantage for a DPP-TSU partnership lies in the fact
that their supporters share a similar ideology of "Taiwan first" and
"separate Taiwan identity from China," Hung said.</P>
      <P>He further pointed out that the results of the Dec. 1 legislative
elections showed that the TSU did not snatch away traditional DPP
supporters.</P>
      <P>Instead, Hung said, the TSU mainly drew votes away from the
pro-Taiwan faction within the KMT which Lee led for 12 years until
the party lost the presidential election in March 2000 for the first
time.</P>
      <P>"At the moment, we see no major obstacles to DPP-TSU
cooperation," Hung said.</P>
      <P>The DPP and the TSU will jointly control 100 seats in the newly
elected 225-member Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>As for the New Party, Hung said he expects the tiny
pro-unification party to "evaporate" or be sidelined in Taiwan's new
political landscape.</P>
      <P>Hung further said that Lee's ouster from the KMT has made it
easier for the KMT and the People First Party (PFP), a splinter group
founded by former KMT Secretary-General James Soong, to cooperate as
their key figures originally belonged to the same "family" and share
a common dream of promoting Taiwan's eventual unification with a
democratic China. The two parties jointly gained 114 seats in the new
Legislature.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Hung said, KMT Chairman Lien Chan and his proteges'
efforts to rid the party of Lee's legacy may lead to another party
split, with the possible departure from the KMT of the pro-Taiwan
faction.</P>
      <P>Touching on the possibility of DPP-PFP cooperation, Hung said
ideological differences are the main obstacles to forging partnership
between the two parties.</P>
      <P>In comparison, Hung said it may be easier for the DPP to
cultivate cooperative ties with the KMT, particularly the KMT's
pro-Taiwan faction.</P>

      <P>Opposition New Party leaders decided
Saturday that the party will undergo organizational reform instead of

      <P>Although a number of New Party members have called for the party
to disband after it lost all but one of its nine seats in the
Legislative Yuan, the committee members who attended the meeting
decided instead to press ahead with reform.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PARTY REALIGNMENTS NOT TO BE FINALIZED BEFORE 2004 POLL: LAWMAKER-ELECT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Dec.  8  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Domestic party realignments are not
expected to be finalized before the 2004 presidential elections,
independent Legislator-elect Sisy Chen said Saturday at a symposium
on Taiwan's post-election political prospects.</P>
      <P>Chen said the results of the Dec. 1 legislative elections will
usher in a brand new political landscape in Taiwan's Legislative
Yuan, with the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) replacing
the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) as the largest party in the
lawmaking body.</P>
      <P>In her view, Chen said, the legislature's post-election
political climate and landscape are still shaping. The newly elected
parliament will not open until next February.</P>
      <P>"It remains unclear at this moment what the new parliamentary
landscape will be," said Chen, who once served as DPP spokeswoman
when the party was still in opposition.</P>
      <P>In an unexpected election rout, the DPP captured 87 of the 225
legislative seats up for grabs, compared to the KMT's 68 seats,
the People First Party's (PFP's) 46 seats and the Taiwan
solidarity Union's (TSU's) 13 seats. The remaining seats went to
independents and margin parties.</P>
      <P>Among the major political parties, the DPP and the TSU share a
similar ideology of "Taiwan first" and "separate Taiwan identity from
China," while the KMT and its splinter group PFP have a
common dream of Taiwan reunifying with a democratic China.</P>
      <P>Chen said it remains to be seen how these four major parties
will interact in the new legislature. She predicted that party
realignments are not expected to be completed until after the next
presidential election scheduled for 2004.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, Hung Yung-tai, a
National Taiwan University political science professor, said he
sees no major hindrances to DPP-TSU cooperation as their supporters
share a similar ideology and TSU's spiritual leader -- former
President Lee Teng-hui -- can help mend their possible differences
at the leadership level.</P>
      <P>As for relations among the DPP, the KMT and the PFP, Hung said
that forging a KMT-PFP partnership should be easier than pushing for
DPP-KMT cooperation in consideration of the DPP's pro-independence
or hardline stance on relations with mainland China.</P>
      <P>Hung further said since both the KMT and the PFP have decided
against joining President Chen Shui-bian's coalition offer, the
Chen-proposed "national stabilization alliance" in the legislature
is not expected to operate smoothly or effectively, even if it can
be formed.</P>
      <P>Chou Yu-jen, a Taipei University public administration
professor, echoed Hung's view, saying that without the
participation of the KMT and the PFP, the DPP will have to seek the
support of independent legislators or maverick lawmakers of
opposition parties.</P>
      <P>"Such an alliance will be weak and vulnerable," Chou said,
adding that he don't think the DPP-led "stabilization alliance"
could really dominate future parliamentary operations.</P>
      <P>The seminar, co-organized by a KMT-affiliated think tank and the
Shanmeng (Mountain Alliance) political group, was attended by
scholars, experts and politicians of different political stripes.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Shen Fu-hsiung said although many political
observers, scholars and legislators-elect have been pushing for an
overhaul of Taiwan's electoral system after last weekend's polls, it
won't be easy to alter the current voting system should the change
require constitutional amendments.</P>
      <P>"We should pool wisdom to craft a new voting system that only
needs revisions of the current Election and Recall Law," said Shen,
a three-term lawmaker.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's present electoral system involves single
non-transferable votes in multimember constituencies. Many
politicians have been advocating a single-seat, two-vote
electoral system that would allow voters to choose both
individual legislative candidate and political party of their
preference.</P>
      <P>PFP Legislator Liu Sung-fan, who once served as speaker of the
Legislative Yuan when he was still a KMT member, said re-demarcation
of electoral districts for a single-seat constituency voting
system is no easy task.</P>
      <P>As for the proposal advocated by some incumbent lawmakers and
legislators-elect to trim the number of parliamentary members, Liu
said the proposed reduction could lead to difficulties in
parliamentary operations and affect the representation and dignity
of individual legislators.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT CHAIRMAN REAFFIRMS COMMITMENT TO COOPERATION WITH PFP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  8  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien
Chan reaffirmed his commitment Saturday to cooperating closely with
other opposition parties in supervising the government's operations.</P>
      <P>In a written message to a seminar on Taiwan's political
landscape in the wake of the Dec. 1 legislative and local elections,
Lien said the KMT is willing to respect the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party's (DPP's) right to form a new Cabinet now that the
DPP has emerged from the polls as the largest party in the
Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>With a view to ending legislative gridlock that has
characterized his first 18 months in office, President Chen
Shui-bian had offered to form a broadbased, cross-party "national
stabilization alliance" before the legislative elections.</P>
      <P>In an unexpected election rout, the DPP managed to capture 87
out the 225 legislative seats up for grabs, ending the KMT's
52-year grip on the parliamentary majority. The KMT gained only 68
seats in the polls, down from 110 in the outgoing legislature.</P>
      <P>Under this new circumstance, Lien said he sees no need for
President Chen to form the so-called "national stabilization
alliance" outside the country's constitutional framework.</P>
      <P>Touching on future inter-party interaction, Lien said the
outcome of the just-concluded local government chief elections
augured that both the KMT and its splinter group -- the People First
Party (PFP) -- will benefit if they cooperate closely.</P>
      <P>The KMT did well in the local-level elections, tied with the DPP
by winning nine mayoral and magistrate posts. In the six cities and
counties that the KMT reclaimed control from the DPP, many
believe that the KMT candidates owed their election victories
partially to the support of PFP loyalists.</P>
      <P>Lien said he is convinced that so long as the KMT and the PFP
can integrate between themselves, they would be able to win major
future elections.</P>
      <P>In order to effectively supervise government operations and
prevent the DPP administration from abusing its power, Lien said the
KMT will strengthen cooperation with other opposition parties in the
new legislature.</P>
      <P>Lien admitted that the KMT had committed some tactical errors in
the legislative elections, including fielding too many candidates
due to pressure from local political factions and incumbent
lawmakers and failing to allocate ballots evenly among its
candidates.</P>
      <P>In his written message read by KMT Secretary-General Lin
Fong-cheng at the seminar, Lien also set the tome of the party's
policy toward relations across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Lien said the 107-year-old KMT, founded in mainland China and
moving to Taiwan after losing a civil war to the Chinese communists
in 1949, will adhere to its fundamental stance on safeguarding the
Republic of China and its constitutional system as well as opposing
any pro-Taiwan independence movement.</P>
      <P>Lien further said the KMT will uphold its stance on respecting a
dual-leadership system prescribed in the ROC constitution and
promoting constructive exchanges with mainland China under the
principle of "one China, with each side of the Taiwan Strait
free to make interpretation of 'one China'."</P>
      <P>The seminar was co-sponsored by a KMT-affiliated think tank
and the Shanmeng (Mountain Alliance) political group.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PFP TO STAY ON SIDELINES OF RACE FOR LEGISLATURE PRESIDENCY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  9 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian has the final say
regarding who will be the next president of the Legislative Yuan and
the People First Party (PFP) will stay out of the contest, said PFP
heavyweight and former Legislative Yuan President Liu Sung-pan
Sunday..</P>
      <P>Although Liu wasn't specific, it is understood that most PFP
legislators-elect feel that current president of the Legislative
Yuan, Wang Jin-pyng of the Kuomintang (KMT), will succeed in his bid
for reelection since the PFP has agreed to cooperate with the KMT.
The two parties have a fragile majority of 114 seats between them at
the 225-seat legislature.</P>
      <P>However, who Wang will pick up as his running mate for vice
president is still anybody's guess. The position of vice president
carries with it heavy political undertones, particularly with the
incoming legislature having a decidedly different make-up from the
one that is in session now.</P>
      <P>Wang took the position from Liu as president of the Legislative
Yuan three years ago after a fierce fight within the KMT, of which
Liu was then a member. The competition drove a wedge between the two
former comrades and led to Liu's breakaway from the KMT and
eventually joining the PFP.</P>
      <P>Observers say this is probably the cause behind Soong's stopping
short of publicly endorsing Wang's candidacy for the presidency after
meeting with KMT Chairman Lien Chan Wednesday. He preferred not to
offend Liu by giving the PFP's support to Liu's former rival.</P>
      <P>Most PFP lawmakers believed Wang is likely to choose a Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) lawmaker as his running mate given that the
DPP, with 87 seats, will be the largest party at the new legislature.</P>
      <P>PFP lawmaker Liu Wen-hsiung said there are voices within his
party to field a candidate for vice presidency as Wang's running
mate, but that the idea was rejected by party leaders because such an
alliance with the KMT would antagonize the DPP and intensified its
attempts to lure away KMT lawmakers who are friendly toward the DPP.</P>
      <P>In that case, Liu Wen-hsiung said, not only will the PFP's
attempts at the vice presidency be thwarted, but Wang's bid for the
presidency will also be jeopardized and, therefore, the new
cooperation between the two opposition parties could be ruined.</P>
      <P>This might explain why PFP spokesman for its legislative caucus
Hsieh Chang-chieh said last week that the PFP prefers to stay on the
sidelines in the race for legislature chiefs, and instead throw its
weight behind Wang's reelection bid.</P>
      <P>But that doesn't means the PFP will support any person chosen by
Wang as his running mate. The party would rather keep its options
open regarding candidates.</P>
      <P>A PFP source close to its chairman, James Soong, said the former
Taiwan provincial governor would support Wang's bid for reelection by
refraining from entering a PFP candidate, but is opposed to any DPP
candidate for either the presidency or the vice presidency.</P>
      <P>This stance might not change the result of the race but will
underline the party's role as the third-largest party in the new
legislature, the source said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>VICE PRESIDENT RECEIVES WORLD PEACE PRIZE  AWARD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 9 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu was given the 2001
World Peace Prize Sunday for her work in women's and human rights,
democracy and the promotion of peace at a ceremony at the
Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>Lu said that the award marks "the beginning of responsibility,"
and that she plans to dedicate more of her time to world peace in the
future.</P>
      <P>The award was presented by representatives of the World Peace
Prize Award Council.</P>
      <P>Lu said that Taiwan security goes hand in hand with world peace.
She also said that in the past, wars were generally started by men
and that if women could take a more active role in world affairs,
wars could be avoided.</P>
      <P>Lu said that when she received the golden plaque from former U.S.
Congressman Lester L. Wolff and chief presiding judge of the award
council, she felt honored but understood the weight of responsibility
that comes with being given such an award.</P>
      <P>Lu said she was born on D-day, 1944, and although she has not
been directly involved in wars, she said that she has heard so many
tragic stories about them. During her childhood, Lu said that her
parents nearly put her up for adoption simply because she was a girl
-- a fact that sowed the seeds of her desire for gender equality.</P>
      <P>She started to promote feminism at age 27, suffered from thyroid
cancer at 30, and was thrown into jail for promoting democracy at 36.</P>
      <P>With all these things in her past, Lu said that she was eternally
grateful to first lady Wu Shu-chen for recommending her to team with
President Chen Shui-bian on the 2000 presidential ticket, creating
history with a male-female president and vice president for the
Republic of China.</P>
      <P>She also said the first lady received the Liberal International's
2001 Prize for Freedom in France in mid-November on the president's
behalf. Lu now receiving the World Peace Prize shows that the
international community has recognized not only Taiwan's economic
miracle, but also its political miracle, which she said "is the fruit
of the efforts of 23 million people in Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Lu, the first female to receive the award since its inauguration
more than a decade ago, noted that Taiwan has gone through poverty in
its half century of colonial rule and during its 38-year martial law
rule. Taiwan has also constantly been threatened by mainland China's
verbal attacks and military intimidation, but despite such adversity,
she said that security and stability has been protected in Taiwan,
and the island's economy and democracy continues to develop.</P>
      <P>Lu said that since assuming the vice presidency, she has promoted
the idea of human rights, democracy, peace and love, hoping to use
the "soft" instead of the "tough" approach in promoting the nation.</P>
      <P>Witnessing the award ceremony were First Lady Wu Shu-chen,
Secretary-General to the president Yu Shyi-kun, former Vice President
Li Yuan-tsu, Premier Chang Chun-hsiung, Legislative Yuan President
Wang Jyn-pyng, Examination Yuan President Hsu Shui-teh, Control Yuan
President Fredrick Chien, Judicial Yuan President Weng Yueh-sheng and
several presidential advisers.</P>
      <P>The first lady, speaking on the same occasion, said that there
have been two miracles over the past month, referring to her -- a
woman confined to a wheelchair receiving a freedom award on behalf of
her husband, who is limited in the overseas trips he can make and the
countries that will diplomatically receive him -- and Lu, who was
convicted for sedition for taking part in the pro-democracy movement
being given the World Peace Prize.</P>
      <P>"This is indeed a Taiwan miracle," Wu said, adding, however, that
the president and the vice president did not create the miracle, but
it was "created by the people of Taiwan," and the honor should go to
all of them.</P>
      <P>Wu said that Taiwan people use wisdom to choose and make good use
of the democratic system, adding that they use votes to decide the
direction of the nation, and show the world that a "Taiwan of
solidarity is brave and not afraid."</P>
      <P>The World Peace Prize Award Council was established in 1990, a
year after U.S. Congressman Robert Leggett and Han Min-su, a South
Korean evangelist, jointly created the World Peace Corps Mission,
patterned after the U.S. Peace Corps.</P>
      <P>Previous recipients of the prize include former U.S. President
Ronald Reagan, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, South Korea's first
president, Syngman Rhee, and late Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak
Rabin.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ANTHRAX USED BY JAPAN KILLED 1 MILLION CHINESE IN WORLD WAR II: EXPERT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Dec. 8 (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung and Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Evidence has been found that Japan used
biological agents, including anthrax, in mainland China during World
War II, killing more than one million people, experts said at a
seminar Saturday.</P>
      <P>Yin Ji-jun, a Chinese American and author of "The Rape of
Biological Warfare," said the Japanese military, not only the
notorious 731 Troops, but also the Japanese navy and army, had used
all sorts of biological weapons to kill mainland Chinese people
during World War II.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a seminar on China-Japan relations being held in
Washington, D.C., the former engineer said his investigation found
that Japan's 731 Troops were only a special branch of the Japanese
army in charge of research into biological warfare. The Japanese navy
established a special air force in Feb. 1942 and dispatched 18
airplanes to spread massive amounts of biological agents along the
Yangzi River.</P>
      <P>In addition, Yin pointed out, at least two divisions of the
Japanese army underwent special training in Shanghai and carried out
germ warfare in southern Zhejiang province and regions adjacent to
what was then Burma and the delta areas of the Yellow River for
military aims.</P>
      <P>After the first U. S. air attack on Tokyo in 1942, the Japanese
military launched large scale biological warfare in Zhejiang and
Jiangxi provinces, Yin said, adding that Zhejiang was particularly
hard hit by Japan's military airplanes due to its holding of mainland
China's airports nearest to Japan. Japan feared that the U. S. might
use those airports to conduct airborne attacks on Japanese territory,
he noted.</P>
      <P>More than 100,000 Chinese troops and civilians were killed in
Jiangxi, and the anthrax spores used by the Japanese military there
were found to be still effective until the early 1950s, according to
Yin. Rats in Jiangxi are still testing positive for anthrax today, he
added.</P>
      <P>Yin said mainland China approved the establishment of its first
research institute on Japanese biological warfare in September of
this year at Changde Normal College in Hunan province.</P>
      <P>The major purpose of the Japanese military's germ warfare was to
kill more Chinese troops and civilians efficiently, Yin said. Many
Chinese people with anthrax were captured alive and many dead bodies
were dug out to be autopsied by Japanese troops to know the effect of
their biological agents.</P>
      <P>Daniel Bareublatt, an American academic who is writing a book
about Japan's anthrax attacks in mainland China, agreed that Japan
resorted to such approaches in mainland China during World War II and
killed thousands of captives.</P>
      <P>At least more than one million people were killed in Japan's germ
war in mainland China, Mongolia and Burma at that time, he went on,
adding that the Japanese military also conducted germ tests on
captured American soldiers. Chemical weapons left by the Japanese
military on the mainland after its surrender still cause huge
problems for local people, he noted.</P>
      <P>Participants at the three-day seminar which ends Sunday also
discussed issues related to the Rape of Nanking and comfort women. A
film about the Rape of Nanking, "In the Name of the Japanese Emperor"
was shown at the seminar.</P>
      <P>Those at the seminar Sunday will discuss topics focusing on
Japan's economic exploration in mainland China, Japan's war
compensation and Japan's criminal war activities in Asia. Yale
professor James B. Crowley will give a keynote speech on the closing
day.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KOREAN WOMEN TO BARE 'JESUS MORNING STAR' FOUNDER'S ALLEGED SCANDAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 9 (CNA)
(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Two Korean women arrived in TaipeI Sunday to
tell how Cheng Myong Suk, founder of the Jesus Morning Star sect,
assailed them sexually in Korea.</P>
      <P>Both accusers, identified only as P and K, will hold a news
conference here Monday to relate their experiences with the Korean
sect founder, who has denied sex abuse charges.</P>
      <P>Wang Wu-kuei, a former Jesus Morning Star priest, said the
two women, both former members of the sect, would substantiate their
accusation of Cheng Myong Suk.</P>
      <P>"They will produce copies of the written indictment against Cheng
by a Seoul district prosecutor," said Wang, who is organizing the
press meeting. The press will also be shown a TV report footage of
the scandal and a copy of the written verdict a Seoul district court
judge handed down on the sect founder.</P>
      <P>A number of female sect members in Taipei made similar charges
against Cheng Myong Suk last month. Wang, who has arranged the two
Korean women's visit here, advanced the charges.</P>
      <P>Cheng Myong Suk was "deified" in Korea, Wang said. "His
two Korean victims will tell how the 'deified' sect leader forced
women followers to have sex with him," he added.</P>
      <P>While here, the two Korean accusers will file a libel suit with
the Taipei district court against Huang Ching-yuan, a Taiwan
spokesman for the Korean sect, on behalf of Kim Do Hyong, a Seoul
resident and Cheng Myong Suk's ex-follower.</P>
      <P>Huang denied the charges and told the press he welcomes Kim
to sue him for libel, adding that truth will come out in the court of
law.</P>
      <P>Former women sect followers like the two Korean accusers have
formed an assistance group, Exodus, to help track down Cheng Myong
Suk, now wanted by the Korean law enforcement authorities, according
to a CNA report from Seoul.</P>
      <P>Exodus members are helping locate the sect founder, who
reportedly left Korea sometime ago.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Parents in Taiwan who believe excellent
academic performance in schools is the only guarantee of their
children for a bright future should read this.</P>
      <P>A teenage high school dropout in Taichung won the first World
Cyber Games in Seoul Sunday.</P>
      <P>Tseng Jeng-cheng, the 17-year-old boy from the central Taiwan
city, took only 30 minutes in the morning to beat his South Korean
rival Kang Byung Geon in the final video game, "Age of Empires 2: the
Conquerors, AOC."</P>
      <P>Kang Byung Geon, a heavily favored adversary, is a veteran video
competition player with many international titles, whom Tseng had
encountered in Internet games before.</P>
      <P>In a blitz, at which he is good, Tseng attacked Kang from the
very beginning of the game. The Korean did his best to defend and
tried to launch conterattacks, but his fate was sealed 20 minutes
into the game, though he soldiered on to fight to the last man.</P>
      <P>A capacity crowd watched the final game and burst into cheers
when Tseng vanquished Kang.</P>
      <P>Tseng attributed his victory to his skill and good luck. "I
was under pressure, but my good luck held," he said.</P>
      <P>Aside from a World Cyber Games prize of US$20,000, the teenage
champion won a cash reward of NT$500,000 from a cyber cafe chain.
Together with NT$150,000 in prize money offered by a Taiwan telephone
company, he collected enough cash, NT$1.35 million or US$38,500, to
equal a lump sum retirement pay of an ordinary white collar worker in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Asked what his plan for the future is, the teenager, who stayed
out of school after finishing Taiwan's nine-year compulsory
education, said -- to the relief of most parents across the island --
he will enrol at a senior high school next year.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian, on a visit to
the 2001 International Container Art Festival in Kaohsiung, said
Sunday he never believed artists could breathe a new life into cool,
rigid metal freight compartments.</P>
      <P>After touring the exhibition in the morning, Chen said Kaohsiung,
the world's fourth top container shipping port, is uniquely qualified
to show what few believe is possible, a metamorphosis of cool metal
compartments into pieces of art.</P>
      <P>Chen toured the site aboard a container-converted limousine.</P>
      <P>"With fine touches," President Chen said, "the artists have given
the lowly containers a new lease on life."</P>
      <P>Altogether 36 artists from 16 countries are displaying their
masterworks at the one-month international exhibition, which opened
at Wharf 21 Saturday.</P>
      <P>On display are containers decorated with graffitti, paintings and
artistic designs. A few appear as coffee shops, while 123 others form
a "labyrinth," which has become a chief attraction.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung Mayor Frank Hsieh, who accompanied President Chen, said
he hopes the container art show would further strengthen cultural
exchange with other cities of the world. Also on Chen's entourage was

      <P>People between 15 and 64 years old have made
up the large part of Taiwan's population, which is rapidly aging,
according to government statistics released Sunday.</P>
      <P>A demographic survey by the Directorate General of Budget,
Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) showed that Taiwan's population
reached 22.26 million as of the end of 2000, with men accounting for
51.2 percent and women 48.8 percent.</P>
      <P>Those below the age of 15 totaled 4.58 million, accounting for
20.7 percent of the population. The people in the 15-to-64 age
bracket numbered 15.69 million, representing 70.8 percent.</P>
      <P>Elderly people, 65 years old and older, totaled 1.89 million,
accounting for 8.5 percent, against 6.1 percent in 1990.</P>
      <P>Officials of the DGBAS said Taiwan's demographic structure now is
very different from that of ten years ago, which can be seen as a
pyramid with the number of aged people at the top and children in the

rapidly. The number of the elderly, they said, has increased by 52.7
percent in the last decade.</P>
      <P>The survey showed that 58.1 percent of the aged people lived with

    <HEADLINE>`COMMITTEE OF 100' DELEGATION MEETS TAIPEI MAYOR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 10 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou said Monday that
his municipal government is willing to play a leading role in
promoting city-to-city cooperation between the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>"I think if each major Taiwan city can choose a suitable mainland
Chinese city for bilateral exchanges of experiences in environmental
protection, traffic management, crime fighting, urban development and
other non-political issues, just like Taipei and Shanghai, both sides
will benefit and cross-strait relations will also gradually improve,"
Ma said while meeting with a "Committee of 100" delegation.</P>
      <P>The New York-based "Committee of 100" is a non-partisan,
non-political association of ethnic Chinese celebrities aimed at
helping bridge cultural and institutional gaps between Americans and
Asian people. Its founding members include architect I. M.
Pei, cellist Yo Yo Ma and Tien Chang-lin, a former chancellor of
the University of California at Berkeley.</P>
      <P>Ma told his guest that although he looks forward to visiting
mainland China to woo investment, he must wait until after the
Republic of China government formally lifts the ban on mainland
visits by elected domestic government chiefs.</P>
      <P>"I feel a bit anxious over the phenomenon that mainland Chinese
city mayors and even provincial government chiefs have swarmed to
visit Taiwan to attract investors," Ma said, adding that he hopes the
central government will ease travel restrictions on city mayors and
county magistrates as early as possible.</P>
      <P>He said the Shanghai city government has tentatively agreed to
send representatives to attend the third Taipei-Hong Kong twin city
forum to be held in Taipei early next year.</P>
      <P>"We hope that a formal three-way Taipei-Hong Kong-Shanghai forum
can be held on a regular basis in the not-too-distant future," Ma
said.</P>
      <P>Noting that cross-strait relations are now very weak and
vulnerable, Ma said each side should respond positively to any
goodwill gesture from the other side and should refrain from making
provocative speeches to hurt the other's feelings.</P>
      <P>Touching on Taiwan's political development in the wake of the
recent legislative elections, Ma said the opposition Kuomintang's
(KMT's) stunning electoral defeat augured an urgent need for the
party to reinvent itself in order to win back voter support.</P>
      <P>Ma, the KMT's brightest political star, said the KMT should also
form an alliance with other like-minded political parties to fulfill
its duty as a responsible opposition loyal to the people, the country
and the ROC Constitution.</P>
      <P>The charismatic mayor further advised the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) to seek inter-party cooperation through
party-to-party negotiations instead of trying to sway elite members
of other parties to defect to its camp. "Such moves would only
trigger political instability," he warned.</P>
      <P>The visiting "Committee of 100" delegation is headed by Fu
Lu-jen, the committee's vice president, and is made up of 20-plus
members, including David Ho, an AIDS expert.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN-HONG KONG AIR TRAFFIC WILL NOT BE DISRUPTED: MOTC HEAD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  10  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Air traffic between Taiwan and Hong Kong
will not be disrupted at the end of the year when a Taiwan-Hong Kong
aviation accord expires, Minister of Transportation and
Communications Yeh Chu-lan said Monday.</P>
      <P>Yeh made the remarks during a legislative committee meeting
during which Legislator Liu Wen-hsiung of opposition People First
Party expressed concern about the lack of contact between Taiwan and
Hong Kong with the pact set to expire in less than one month.</P>
      <P>Liu criticized the Ministry of Transportation and Communications
(MOTC) for stressing the issue of ideology and for not being able to
help the aviation industry solve the problem.</P>
      <P>The Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) under the MOTC is
responsible for arranging technical details for bilateral talks, but
since Hong Kong reverted to mainland Chinese rule in July 1997, the
Mainland Affairs Council (MAC), which charts Taiwan's policy toward
mainland China, has taken charge of issues related to Hong Kong,
including civil aviation affairs.</P>
      <P>Liu said that if the two sides fail to renew the aviation accord,
airlines from both sides will have to apply to maintain Taiwan-Hong
Kong air services with chartered planes on a case by case basis
starting next year.</P>
      <P>Yeh said negotiation of a Taiwan-Hong Kong aviation pact is a
sensitive issue involving affairs with mainland China. She said a
task force headed by the MAC is currently working in a "cautious,
responsible" manner for the talks, adding that she knows perfectly
well the importance of the Taiwan-Hong Kong route to both sides of
the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Yeh said that the task force has explored all scenarios. Although
she said she could not divulge the details, she assured the
Legislature that air services will not be disrupted.</P>
      <P>Legislator Liu suggested that Taiwan-Hong Kong aviation pact
negotiations be left to unofficial airline associations on both sides
as in the past, saying that otherwise, the insistence on official
talks will fail to achieve anything.</P>
      <P>Reports said that the MAC also wants to send officials as
advisers during aviation pact talks with Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>Under the current Taiwan-Hong Kong aviation pact signed in 1996,
the two sides must review the agreement once every five years. When
the pact expired June 12 this year, the two sides failed to meet to
review the accord, although they agreed to extend the accord to the
end of this year.</P>
      <P>Although the pact's new expiration date is drawing near, sources
close to the CAA said that the agency has still not been able to
prepare the agenda for negotiations.</P>
      <P>At present, Taiwan and Hong Kong are each allowed to operate 121
flights between the two destinations per week. Of Taiwan's quota,
China Airlines accounts for 105 flights and EVA Airways operates the
remaining 16 flights.</P>
      <P>On the Hong Kong side, Cathay Pacific Airways accounts for 100
flights and Dragonair is allowed to operate 21 flights. Both EVA and
Dragonair hope that the aviation accord can be revised to allow them
to operate more flights as the demand for Taiwan-Hong Kong flight
services has continued to rise, despite the current economic
downturn.</P>
      <P>Now that Taiwan has eased restrictions on mainland China-bound
investment, airline sources said, more Taiwan businesspeople intend
to travel to the mainland via Hog Kong for market-inspection tours,
pushing up demand for additional flights.</P>

    <HEADLINE>HIGH-PROFILE POLICE MISSION LEAVES FOR MAINLAND VISIT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 10 (CNA)
(By David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A high-profile police delegation, headed by
Cheng Ching-sung, director of the Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB)
under the National Police Administration (NPA), left for mainland
China Monday on a fact-finding mission.</P>
      <P>This is the first time that senior Republic of China police
officers have visited mainland China to promote bilateral cooperation
in cracking down on crime.</P>
      <P>Prior to his departure, Chen said his group will meet with
mainland China's public security officials on possible cooperation in
fighting criminal activities across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>"In addition to exchanging views on halting cross-strait human
and firearm smuggling as well as drug trafficking," Cheng said: "The
two sides will also discuss cooperation in fighting economic crimes
following their accession to the World Trade Organization."</P>
      <P>The delegation is scheduled to visit mainland China's Ministry of
Public Security and the Public Security Bureau under the Beijing City
Government Tuesday.</P>
      <P>During its 12-day visit, the delegation will also meet public
security authorities in Shanghai and Guangdong and Fujian provinces
as well as the mainland Chinese Police Society and its branches in
major mainland cities.</P>
      <P>The visit was organized by the private Taipei-based Criminal
Investigation and Prevention Association (CIPA). Members of Cheng's
mission also included CIPA Chairman Lu Yu-jun, who once served as the
NPA director-general, and several incumbent CIB section chiefs.</P>
      <P>Two middle-ranking Taiwan police officers made a trend-setting
visit to mainland China after 24 Taiwan tourists were murdered at
Qiandao Lake in the southeastern mainland province of Zhejiang in
March 1994.</P>
      <P>In August 1996, Taiwan launched a large-scale crackdown on
organized crime, resulting in the flight of a number of underworld
ringleaders to the mainland. In November that year, then-CIB Director
Chang Yo-wen intended to travel to the mainland via Hong Kong to seek
possible mainland cooperation in bringing underworld figures back to
Taiwan. However, Chang was forced to cancel his trip when the media
caught wind of his plans.</P>
      <P>Thanks to the assistance of private academic groups on both
sides, cross-strait police exchanges have gradually increased in
recent years. Two senior Shanghai public security officers attended a
seminar on cross-strait criminal activities in May 1998.</P>
      <P>In July this year, 15 mainland Chinese incumbent and retired

    <HEADLINE>MAC CHIEF RENEWS CALL ON BEIJING TO RESPOND TO 'MINI LINKS'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kinmen,  Dec.  10  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Nearly a year after the opening of three
direct "mini links" across the Taiwan Strait, the Republic of
China's top mainland policy planner renewed her call on Beijing to
make positive response to the "open door" measure.</P>
      <P>Tsai Ing-wen, chairwoman of the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs
Council (MAC), made the appeal after receiving a certificate of
honorary citizen of Kinmen County from outgoing Magistrate Chen
Shui-tsai.</P>
      <P>Chen said the county government has decided to name Tsai and two
other senior MAC officials the county's honorary citizens in
recognition of their efforts to open three direct "mini links" of
trade, mail and shipping between the two ROC-held frontline islands
of Kinmen and Matsu and mainland China's Xiamen and Mawei port
cities in Fujian province, which lies opposite Taiwan, at the
beginning of this year.</P>
      <P>"It was the most important step in Kinmen's development in more
than 50 years," Chen said, adding that although the effects of the
new opening measure has not fully lived up to public expectations,
it's not the fault of the MAC.</P>
      <P>The biggest obstacle to the expansion of the "mini links" mainly
lies in Beijing's reluctance to resume talks with Taipei and its
refusal to adopt coordinate measures, Chen noted.</P>
      <P>For her part, Tsai said the opening of three direct links
between Kinmen/Matsu and Xiamen-Mawei is a critical step to the
development of cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>Over the past year, Tsai said, the central government has
devoted much energy and administrative resources to the "mini links"
project. Despite its limited functions due to Beijing's
incooperation, she said, the government will not be daunted and will
instead continue carrying out the project in a pragmatic manner.</P>
      <P>Tsai urged mainland Chinese leaders to recognize the benefits
the "mini links" have brought to the people on both sides and take
necessary steps to pave the way for the opening of regular
direct Kinmen-Xiamen and Matsu-Mawei shipping services as early as
possible.</P>
      <P>Beijing now still approves applications for direct Kinmen-Xiamen
and Matsu-Mawei shipping services on a case-by-case basis and
imposes stringent restrictions on visits by mainland people to the
ROC's two defense outposts, both of which lie closer to mainland
China than to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Tsai said the MAC is conducting an overall review of the "mini
links" and will adopt feasible measures to upgrade Kinmen and
Matsu's functions as a midpoint for cross-strait exchanges,
including boosting legal trade between Kinmen/Matsu and mainland
China to curb smuggling.</P>
      <P>The two other MAC officials awarded the Kinmen honorary citizen
status were Vice Chairman John C. C. Teng and MAC Chief Secretary
Pao Cheng-kang.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FINANCE MINISTER CONFIDENT OF TAIWAN'S ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  10 (CNA)
(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Minister of Finance Yen
Ching-chang Monday expressed his confidence in the development of
Taiwan's economy in the coming months, saying that "the worst has
passed."</P>
      <P>Yen made the remarks while reporting the progress of financial
reforms at the Finance Committee of the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lin Wen-lang of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party said that after the Dec. 1 legislative and local elections, the
weighted index on the Taiwan stock market has shot up 1,200 points,
coupled with the influx of foreign capital amounting to NT$40
billion.</P>
      <P>He attributed the encouraging performances mainly to the
post-elections stable political situation and the financial reforms
being implemented by the Ministry of Finance.</P>
      <P>In response, Yen said that during last September's ministerial
meeting of the Asian-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Shanghai,
some foreign ministers predicted to him that the success of Taiwan to
engage in financial reform amid global business sluggishness would
enable Taiwan to catch the first wave of the global economic rebound.</P>
      <P>"I have a deep confidence in Taiwan's future economy," he
stressed.</P>
      <P>Regarding the establishment of financial holding companies, Yen
said that his ministry would strictly screen the applications
submitted by the financial institutions.</P>
      <P>He noted that although he has stated that the reasonable number
of financial holding companies for the island is 15, he added that it
is not a binding figure.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lai Shih-pao of the tiny opposition New Party asked
the minister to help bring down the interests charged on house
mortgages by banks, saying that the interests remain as high as 8
percent per annum, while the interests for time deposits are only
around 2.5 percent.</P>
      <P>Yen said that he is not in a position to promise lowering the
interests for house mortgages on behalf of banks, but he can send
messages to banks persuading them to try to lower the interests.</P>

    <HEADLINE>RAND REPORT SEES CLOSER TAIWAN-U.S. TIES IN NEAR TERM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Dec.  10 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Political, economic and military ties
will strenghten between Washington and Taipei over the next four to
five years, but the United States should maintain a degree of
ambiquity regarding its stance on cross-strait affairs, according to
a report recently published by the Rand Corporation.</P>
      <P>In the 172-page report titled "Taiwan's Foreign and Defense
Policies: Features and Determinants," analysts Michael Swaine and
James Mulvernon wrote that the Chen Shui-bian administration's
defense policy will seek to obtain quantitatively and qualitatively
greater levels of weaponry and related military assistance from the
United States, and to develop closer military and political relations
between Taipei and Washington.</P>
      <P>Yet internal debates will continue to rage over the dangers,
costs and opportunities presented by President Chen's policy
proposals, such as the adoption of offensive strike capabilities and
the construction of sophisticated ballistic missile defense systems.</P>
      <P>Convinced that Taiwan's foreign and defense policies will
continue to exert a profound impact on American relations with both
Taiwan and mainland China, they made the following specific policy
recommendations:</P>
      <P>-- Since Taiwan's foreign and defense policy-makers rely on U.S.
military intervention as a key assumption in their planning, U.S.
policy should be calibrated to deter or prevent any Taiwan leader
from undertaking political actions that Washington believes might
provoke an attack by mainland China.</P>
      <P>-- Significant benefit is gained by preserving ambiguity over
U.S. intentions towards Taiwan's security and international status.
The U.S. government should maintain a public allegiance to the notion
of "one China" as originally defined in the U.S.-PRC normalization
agreements, combined with a posture of public ambiguity regarding the
level of U.S. commitment to defend Taiwan.</P>
      <P>-- Privately, the United States should make it clear to Beijing
that it will respond militarily out of necessity in the event of a
mainland Chinese attack, while stating privately to Taipei that the
United States will prevent what it views as any unilateral attempt to
secure an independent status for Taiwan. "American support for
Taiwan's democratic development should not equate with support for
independence," the analysts said.</P>
      <P>They added that Beijing will not accept a mere avoidance of a
formal declaration of independence by Taiwan as sufficient to
guarantee "no independence"; Taiwan could take other actions, with
U.S. support, that Beijing would view as dangerous -- and Taiwan
would be more inclined to do so if the United States provides a
public defense guarantee.</P>
      <P>However, Rand analysts Michael Swaine and James Mulvenon wrote
that domestic constraints on Taipei and Beijing will likely
perpetrate a policy stalemate over cross-Strait relations, with both
sides appealing to outside constituencies to facilitate a deal.</P>
      <P>But given the reluctance of Washington to directly mediate talks
between the two sides, they said, "there is little prospect for
improvement in (cross-strait) ties in the short-term."

for Beijing via Hong Kong Monday to meet officials on the mainland to
discuss the "mini three links."</P>
      <P>They are to join two others from the island of Matsu --
Lienchiang County magistrate-elect Chen Hsueh-sheng and
legislator-elect Chao Yuan-chang, both of the People First Party --
and outgoing legislator Elmer Feng of New Party, in Beijing for a
four-day visit. The trio arrived in Beijing a day earlier on Sunday.</P>
      <P>Lee said that he has visited the mainland many times over the
past year, and during his campaign, he had promised mainland spouses
who married Taiwan men and veterans that he would visit the mainland
after the elections, hoping to convince the mainalnd to simplify
their entry and exit procedures and to better understand the needs of
Kinmen citizens currently residing in the mainland.</P>
      <P>Lee said the most important thing will be to communicate with the
mainland on the direct trade, postal and transportation links, or
"mini three links" between the islands of Kinmen and Matsu and
mainland China.</P>
      <P>Lee noted that the "mini three links," inaugurated Jan. 1, 2001,
will need an overall review after a year of implementation. He also
said that he has appealed to the Mainland Affairs Council several
times to ease the restrictions that only allow direct cross-strait
travel for those who have resided on Kinmen or Matsu for six months
or more. Lifting this restriction, Lee said, would help Taiwan
businessmen and Kinmen citizens living overseas to travel to the
mainland directly to help the inauguration of regular shipping
services between Kinmen and Xiamen.</P>
      <P>Legislator-elect Wu also said that he promised to promote the
inauguration of regular shipping services between Kinmen and Xiamen
during the campaign, and he is hoping to deliver on that promise.</P>
      <P>Both Lee and Wu said that they hoped to make headway in the
technical matters involving the "mini three links" to respond to the
voters' needs. They also wanted residents to be able to get support
from the governments on both sides so that cross-strait relations
could enter a new stage.</P>
      <P>The group will call on officials from the Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Strait and Taiwan Affairs Office in
Beijing before heading to Fuzhou, Xiamen Wednesday. Their trip will
end Thursday.</P>

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Chung Hua Institution for Economic
Research warned Monday in a report that drastic fluctuations of the
local currency will have a negative impact on the Taiwan economy.</P>
      <P>Sharp devaluation or appreciation of the New Taiwan dollar will
disturb normal economic activities and the effects of such an
approach to boost local exports will be limited, the report said,
calling on the government to act cautiously when considering such
measures.</P>
      <P>The report commissioned by the Board of Foreign Trade on Taiwan's
2000-2001 currency policy showed that the New Taiwan dollar
depreciated by 6.96 percent in the first two quarters of this year,
while exports dwindled by 10.8 percent during the same period. It is
obvious that currency devaluations will not help lift export levels,
the report pointed out.</P>
      <P>The report also said that currency deprecations will push up
prices of import products and result in increased production costs
for local exporters, thus also affecting the export trade.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING SHOULD RENOUNCE MILITARY THREAT AGAINST TAIWAN: PREMIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Dec.   10   (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung urged
mainland China Monday to renounce military threat against Taiwan in
line with the United Nations-initiated Universal Declaration of
Human Rights.</P>
      <P>Chang made the appeal in a ceremony marking the Dec. 10 World
Human Rights Day.</P>
      <P>Noting that human rights are universal values, Chang said human
rights can be truly protected only in a peaceful environment.</P>
      <P>Chang said the U.N. Assembly on Dec. 10, 1948 adopted the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which states that "all human
beings are born with equal and inalienable rights and fundamental
freedoms."</P>
      <P>"Mainland Chinese leaders should respect the common aspiration of
the people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait for basic human rights
and renounce their threat of the use of force against Taiwan,"
Chang said.</P>
      <P>The premier further called on mainland leaders to be
broad-minded and forward-looking enough to work together with Taiwan
in breaking the lingering cross-strait impasse and forging mutual
trust for creating permanent peace in the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Chang went on to say that Taiwan's history over the past five
decades is characterized by its people's pursuit of human rights and
dignity.</P>
      <P>"We have come a long way in ending martial law and authoritarian
rule to become a mature democracy," Chang said, adding that
President Chen Shui-bian, who swept to power in Taiwan's first-ever
peaceful transition of power between different political parties in
May 2000, has vowed to substantiate human rights protection during
his term of office.</P>
      <P>Chang said the Cabinet already asked the Legislative Yuan on
April 25 to ratify the two major international conventions on the
protection of civic and political rights as well as economic, social
and cultural rights.</P>
      <P>In addition, Chang said, the Cabinet has ordered relevant
government agencies to conduct a comprehensive review on current
domestic laws to see whether they violate any international human
rights conventions.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chang said, the Cabinet has set up a human rights
task force to push for the establishment of a national human rights
commission to better protect basic human rights.</P>
      <P>On Feb. 1, 2002, Chang said, the Cabinet is scheduled to unveil
its first white paper on human rights policy. From then on, the
government will release a national human rights report annually to
review the domestic human rights conditions.</P>
      <P>In the future, Chang said, the government will sponsor
international seminars on human rights issues from time to time to
arouse public attention to human rights protection.</P>

(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian reiterated Monday
in a meeting with the delegates of a non-partisan overseas Chinese
group that "one China" is an issue that can be discussed in future
dialogue with mainland China.</P>
      <P>However, Chen said that "one China" should not be a precondition
to such talks until such time as Taipei and Beijing have reached a
mutually acceptable meaning for the term through "wisdom and
creativity."</P>
      <P>Chen told the visiting "Committee of 100" delegation, headed by
its vice president, Fu Lu-jen, and comprised of over 20 members
including world-renowned AIDS treatment expert David Ho, that "one
China" was originally not a problem according to the Republic of
China Constitution.</P>
      <P>The problem, he went on, is that if the so-called "one China"
principle cherished by Beijing "makes the Republic of China vanish,"
then as a guardian of ROC sovereignty, dignity and security, he
cannot accept the principle.</P>
      <P>The president said that the government will continue to push for
normalized relations between Taipei and Beijing and to look forward
to the moment when the leaders from both sides meet and shake hands.</P>
      <P>The two sides of the Taiwan Strait could temporarily shelve
disputed issues and begin with those related to commercial and
cultural integration, he added.</P>
      <P>Chen urged Beijing to focus more on economics and less on
politics and called for greater contact and less misunderstanding as
well as greater trust and less oppression of Taipei by Beijing.</P>
      <P>The New York-based "Committee of 100" is a non-partisan,
non-political association of ethnic Chinese that aims to help bridge
cultural and institutional gaps between Americans and Asians. Its
founding members include architect I.M. Pei, cellist Yo Yo Ma and
Tien Chang-lin, a former chancellor of the University of California

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  10 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China Air Force has found
using remote-controlled model planes to be an effective method of
scaring birds away from runways and sky over at its airbases, an air
force officer said Monday.</P>
      <P>Lin Yu-pao, a deputy head of the 401 Wing based in Hualien,
eastern Taiwan, said that extensive testing of the method at the
Hualien air base in eastern Taiwan has proved it to be very
effective.</P>
      <P>Lin said that two of the model planes are flown at the same time
from either end of the runway, which scares away birds and prevents
them from approaching real airplanes that are landing and taking off.
The method, he went on, is particularly effective against doves and
egrets.</P>
      <P>Lin noted that the 30 minutes before sunrise or after sunset are
the times when birds are on the move between their roosts and their
feeding grounds and added that pilots know to avoid landing and
taking off during these times.</P>
      <P>Kung Shiang-Kai, director of the 401 Wing's Political Warfare
Department, said bird-hits by aircraft is a major problem all over
the world and one that has caused many accidents. He added that the
downing of at least one F-5F from the Taitung base and the crash of a
Mirage jet fighter from the Hsinchu base were attributed to
bird-hits.</P>
      <P>Kung said the other methods used by the air force to deal with
birds, such as using shotguns or erecting nets, have all gradually
become ineffective.</P>

Monday.</P>
      <P>A GIO official said that a container ship, which will transport

over Jiangxi province nearly four decades ago were laid to rest
Monday after being airlifted back to Taiwan last week.</P>

downed P-2V long-range patrol aircraft of the 34th Squadron, known as
the "Black Bats."</P>
      <P>Eulogizing the crew's heroic actions, Chen said that the Air

remains of other officers downed over mainland China.</P>
      <P>The P-2V, led by squadron leader Col. Chou Yi-li, was on a

June 19, 1963. None of the crew members reportedly survived.</P>
      <P>Their bodies were discovered by locals soon after the mishap,
whereupon the remains were kept in Jiangxi by the mainland
authorities. Private talks about having the remains returned to
Taiwan did not start until recent years after Taiwan began allowing

      <P>Hsiao Chia-chen, the widow of the dead squadron leader, has been

    <HEADLINE>KAOHSIUNG PLANS TO BID FOR RIGHTS TO HOST 2010 ASIAN GAMES: MAYOR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>San  Francisco,  Dec.  10  (CNA)
(By Neil Lu and Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's second largest city,
Kaohsiung, plans to bid for the rights to host the 2007 Universiade
and the 2010 Asian Games, Kaohsiung Mayor Frank Hsieh said Monday
during a courtesy call on San Francisco Mayor Willie L. Brown Jr.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said his city will cooperate with neighboring cities to
host the Asian Games, adding that valuable experience can be gained
by first hosting the Universiade.</P>
      <P>If Kaohsiung were to win the bid to host the Asian Games, it
would mark the largest international sporting event ever to be held
in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>For Kaohsiung's reference, Brown said that he will provide Hsieh
with the complete version of San Francisco's own bidding proposal to
host the 2012 Olympic Games.</P>
      <P>San Francisco is among eight U.S. cities that are currently in
the process of bidding for the 2012 Olympic Games. The U.S. candidate
city is scheduled to be named during the October 2002 meeting of the
United States Olympic Committee Board of Directors.</P>
      <P>Hsieh and Brown also exchanged opinions on such issues as urban
and harbor development. Kaohsiung Harbor is the world's
fourth-largest container port, and San Francisco Bay is one of the
world's largest natural harbors.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, touching on issues related to Taiwan's domestic
politics, Hsieh told reporters after his meeting with Brown that the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party remains dedicated to the
establishment of a "national stabilization alliance" but that it has
slowed down the pace to refrain from provoking the opposition
parties.</P>
      <P>Hsieh serves concurrently as DPP chairman.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LAWS ALLEGEDLY VIOLATING SPEECH FREEDOM NOT YET DISCUSSED: PREMIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 11 (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung said Tuesday that
the Cabinet has not yet formulated a policy to discuss possible
amendments to a number of laws that might violate freedom of speech
by banning open discussions on splitting the country.</P>
      <P>Chang said while being interpellated by a legislator that the
details of the issue will only be discussed when the Ministry of the
Interior has reported its findings to the Cabinet. Even then, he went
on, any amendments would require ratification by the Legislative
Yuan.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the Cabinet did not order such amendments to be
drafted, Chang said that the issue nevertheless must be discussed and
handled solemnly because it was brought to light when two local
professors were charged with violating related laws, kindling debate
on the constitutional guarantee of freedom of speech.</P>
      <P>In a ceremony marking World Human Rights Day on Monday, Chang
said that the Cabinet has ordered relevant government agencies to
conduct a comprehensive review of current domestic laws to determine
whether they violate any international human rights conventions.</P>
      <P>According to local reports, government officials said Monday that
a number of laws should be evaluated and amended because of certain
"outdated" provisions that might run counter to human rights.</P>
      <P>Article Four of the Gathering and Parade Law states that public
gatherings and parades should not be held to promote communism or a
splitting of the country. Article Two of the Civic Organization Law
also stipulates that organizations and activities should not be
geared toward such causes.</P>
      <P>Chang is a member of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party,
which has traditionally been in favor of forming an independent
Taiwan republic, an act that could be construed as "splitting the
country" under the previous Kuomintang administration's policy of
"one China" which allowed Taipei and Beijing to interpret the term in
their own way.</P>
      <P>Beijing has repeatedly warned it would attack Taiwan if the
island were to move toward independence.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, at the same interpellation session, Chang said that he
has ordered relevant government agencies to look into whether the
organizers of a cross-Taiwan Strait technology forum sponsored by the
National Science Council have violated Cabinet regulations by calling
the mainland Chinese participants by their official titles while
self-degradingly removing the titles of Taiwan's own participating
officials out of fear of angering Beijing.</P>
      <P>Chang said that such cross-strait academic meetings must be held
under the principles of respect and parity and that organizers must
not damage national dignity in the process of holding such meetings.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China rolled out the red
carpet Tuesday to welcome the arrival of Sao Tome and Principe
President Fradique Bandeira Melo de Menezes for a five-day state
visit.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian presided over the welcoming ceremony in
the National Concert Hall at the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall
complex in downtown Taipei.</P>
      <P>During the ceremony, Menezes was accorded with full military
honors, complete with a 21-gun salute. Menezes was elected the West
African state's third popularly elected president in a landslide
victory in July this year. This is his first visit to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In a brief welcoming speech, President Chen first congratulated
Menezes on his election victory. Chen said Menezes is not only a
knowledgeable politician but also a successful entrepreneur.</P>
      <P>"I admire you for your outstanding contributions to political and
economic development in your country," Chen said in his speech.</P>
      <P>Despite the geographic distance, Chen said, relations between the
ROC and Sao Tome and Principe have continued to grow steadily since
the two countries forged formal diplomatic ties in May 1997.</P>
      <P>With concerted efforts of the two countries, Chen said bilateral
cooperative programs in the fields of agriculture, culture, medicine,
education and infrastructure construction have been proceeding
smoothly and have borne fruit.</P>
      <P>For his part, Menezes said he takes great pleasure in visiting
Taiwan and appreciates all the hospitality extended to him and his
entourage.</P>
      <P>Menezes further expressed his gratitude for the ROC's assistance
to his country in agricultural and economic development as well as
medical services over the past years.</P>
      <P>At the end of the ceremony, Taipei Ma Ying-jeou presented a "key
to the city" to Menezes as a souvenir. Vice President Annette Lu and
many other senior ROC officials and members of the diplomatic corps
also attended the welcoming ceremony.</P>
      <P>Later in the day, Menezes paid a visit to the Presidential Office
where he held wide-ranging talks with President Chen.</P>
      <P>Chen said he looks forward to seeing bilateral exchanges and
cooperation further grow based on the current foundation,
particularly in agriculture, medical services and industries related
to people's livelihood.</P>
      <P>Noting that the ROC sent a delegation of political scientists to
observe Sao Tome and Principe's July presidential election, Chen said
he was pleased to learn that it was a fair, just and credible
democratic election.</P>
      <P>"This indicates that Sao Tome and Principe is a mature democracy
and can be a model for other African countries to emulate," Chen
said.</P>
      <P>Menezes told President Chen that he admires Taiwan's progress in
political democratization and economic prosperity. "I hope my current
visit will help strengthen bilateral ties," he said, adding that his
country desires to learn from Taiwan's developmental experience to
boost its own economic development.</P>
      <P>Menezes and his entourage arrived in Taipei Monday. Members of
his entourage included Minister of Foreign and Cooperation Affairs
Patice Emery Trovocada and Minister of Economic Affairs Julio da
Silva.</P>

EDUCATORS AND LEGISLATORS PONDER IMPACT OF WORLD CYBER GAMES CHAMP</P>
      <P>Taipei, Dec. 11 (CNA) Educators are scratching their heads after
Tseng Jeng-cheng, a 17-year-old Taiwanese boy who never bothered to
go to high school, won first prize in the World Cyber Games in Seoul,
South Korea Dec. 9. Parents fear that the boy's lack of education
will be seen by his peers as a badge of honor.</P>
      <P>Tseng finished junior high school two years ago. After that, his
education consisted mainly of playing video games, a fact that helped
him win the top spot in the computer game "Age of Empires 2: The
Conquerors," and take home prize money of US$20,000 and NT$650,000.</P>
      <P>Since Tseng won recognition with his talent in playing "games,"
Taiwan society has begun to examine the influence of the "skills"
involved and the fact that a player could advance to such a high
level without much education.</P>
      <P>Even Minister of Education Ovid Tzeng has spoken of including
video game-related technology applications in the curriculum of
schools.</P>
      <P>Video games became a topic of great interest at a meeting of the
committee on educational affairs of the Legislative Yuan Monday.
Several legislators wondered how to incorporate information
technology applications into the existing science-related courses in
school, and how to cultivate talents in this field.</P>
      <P>Legislator Chen Chin-jun said that the Tseng Jeng-cheng
phenomenon exposed the rigidity of Taiwan's educational system.
Special talents or interests of students very often are subjugated to
stricter disciplines of conformity.</P>
      <P>Legislator Wong Chin-chu called on the education ministry to make
some adjustments to the school curricula and to accommodate subjects
that will interest youths more.</P>
      <P>Minister Tseng said that he agreed with the legislators regarding
creating a proper educational environment for students with special
talents. On the other hand, he stressed the importance for youngsters
to learn the basics within the school system. He suggested that the
young video champion finish his schooling.</P>
      <P>Tseng said after receiving the gold medal in Seoul that he wanted
to continue his education. Like Tseng's parents, many other parents
were relieved to hear this. Tseng's success in Seoul had worried many
educators and parents that this single case might lead some

    <HEADLINE>RESEARCHER SAYS BUSINESS CLIMATE  TO RECOVER NEXT YEAR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  11  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Despite global economic uncertainties,
Taiwan's business climate may recover next year, Taiwan Research
Institute President Liu Tai-ying forecast Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a seminar on economic cooperation in East Asia
sponsored by the institute, Liu said although it remains to be seen
when the world economy will regain momentum, Taiwan's economy will
improve in 2002 after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks against the
United States.</P>
      <P>According to Liu, Taiwan's hi-tech exports have slumped by 20
percent following the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</P>
      <P>Liu said Taiwan and other East Asian countries rely greatly on
the United States for their hi-tech outbound shipments. Sharp
declines in the tech-heavy Nasdaq since March 2000 resulted in a
global recession and have hugely affected the high-tech industries of
those countries, he added.</P>
      <P>Although the United States has cut its interests rates many
times, Liu said it remains uncertain when the global economy will
recover. It has been forecast that East Asian economies, including
Japan, Singapore and Hong Kong will register negative growth for this
year. Taiwan is expected to post a negative 2 percent economic
growth.</P>
      <P>In face of the global economic sluggishness and fierce
competition from mainland China, Liu contended that most East Asian
countries have to boost demand at home and seek cooperation with
other countries to sustain their economies. At the same time,
currency stability and a sound financial system are also key issues
in economic cooperation between East Asian countries, he said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The first batch of relief goods donated by
the Republic of China government and private charitable groups to
Afghan refugees will be delivered Wednesday, the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs (MOFA) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The relief goods include 90,000 pieces of second-hand clothing
donated by the Buddhist Compassion Relief Tzu Chi Foundation, 940
pairs of sneakers donated by the Field Relief Agency, NT$300,000
(US$8,695.65) worth of pharmaceuticals donated by the Taiwan
Pharmaceutical Industry Association as well as 14,000 blankets and
pharmaceuticals donated by the ROC government.</P>
      <P>MOFA Chief Secretary Peter Cheng said the relief goods will be
shipped to Iran from the northern Taiwan port of Keelung Tuesday and
are scheduled to arrive at their final destination Dec. 24</P>
      <P>According to Cheng, the ROC government and private charities will
donate NT$110 million worth of relief goods and cash in two batches
to help Afghan people displaced by the ongoing U.S.-led
anti-terrorist strikes on the Taliban regime in Afghanistan.</P>
      <P>"The donations are expected to benefit 6,300 Afghan families,"
Cheng said, adding that the government will continue coordinating
with private organizations in offering humanitarian aid to Afghan
refugees.</P>
      <P>Cheng said the government will also seek to cooperate with
international disaster relief organizations in helping Afghan people.</P>
      <P>In addition, Cheng said, MOFA is keeping a close watch on an
upcoming meeting of representatives from the 15-member European
Union, the United States, Japan and other major countries on possible
long-term financial aid to Afghanistan in the wake of the downfall of
the Taliban regime.</P>
      <P>"We may refer to the conclusions reached at the planned meeting
in drawing up our future aid program for Afghan refugees," Chen said.</P>
      <P>He further said the ROC's relief goods will be distributed to
Afghan refugee camps in Mashad in the north and Zahendan in the south
through the Iranian chapter of the International Red Crescent
Society, the only non-government organization authorized by the
Iranian government and the Taliban regime to conduct relief and aid
activities in Afghanistan.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Cheng said, the ROC will take part in an aid program
to assist Afghan children, organized by a U.S.-based international
charitable group.</P>
      <P>"We'll offer humanitarian assistance to 10,000 displaced Afghan
households in northern Afghanistan through the U.S.-based
organization," Cheng said, adding that under this project, the ROC
will donate 240 tons of rice, 250 tents and 76,000 blankets, worth
NT$87.76 million.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Cheng said, the ROC government will offer US$200,000 in
cash to help finance the organization's various rescue and relief
projects.</P>
      <P>Cheng said Chiang Kuo-chiang, director of the Taipei Economic and
Cultural Office in Seattle, will sign a memorandum of understanding
with the U.S. charitable organization in the near future on the
relief cooperation.</P>
      <P>The government will foot the bill for shipping the relief goods

    <HEADLINE>CROSS-STRAIT DIALOGUE MAY RESUME NEXT YEAR: MAC CHIEF</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  11 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairwoman
Tsai Ing-wen said Tuesday she foresees the possibility of the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait resume dialogue next year.</P>
      <P>Tsai made the remarks during a meeting with a delegation of the
"Committee of 100," a New York-based non-partisan association of
ethnic Chinese celebrities.</P>
      <P>Noting that President Chen Shui-bian has on many occasions
expressed goodwill to mainland China, Tsai said so long as Beijing
leaders can carefully mull the significance of Chen's statements on
cross-strait affairs, particularly the "one China" issue, there
should be opportunities for the two sides to resume talks.</P>
      <P>"It all depends on how mainland China interprets President
Chen's latest remarks on cross-strait relations and how the two
sides cultivate an environment favorable for resumption of
their long-stalled dialogue," Tsai explained.</P>
      <P>While meeting with the "Committee of 100" delegation Monday,
President Chen said "one China" is an issue that can be discussed in
the future with mainland China. However, Chen said "one China" should
not be a precondition for talks until such time as Taipei and Beijing
have reached a mutually acceptable meaning for the the term through
"wisdom and creativity."</P>
      <P>Chen also told the visiting members of the overseas Chinese group
that the so-called "one China" was originally not a problem according
to the Republic of China Constitution. The problem, he went on, is
that the so-called "one China" principle cherished by Beijing "makes
the Republic of China vanish." Therefore, as a guardian of the ROC
sovereignty, dignity and security, he cannot accept the principle.</P>
      <P>Tsai said cross-strait dialogue is not expected to resume
overnight.</P>
      <P>"The two sides must forge mutual trust and work out certain
procedures to ensure that talks are conducted on a solid basis,"
Tsai noted.</P>
      <P>In her view, Tsai said, both sides have been endeavoring to
prevent the results of Taiwan's recent parliamentary and local
government chief elections from affecting the stability of
cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>Tsai said although the spokesman for mainland China's Taiwan
Affairs Office failed to give any positive response to Taiwan's
goodwill in his first post-Taiwan election news conference, he
appeared to be fully aware of the importance of maintaining
stability in the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The nation's top mainland policy planner also assured her
guests that the government's policy toward mainland China will
remain unchanged after the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
emerged from the recent legislative elections as the island's
largest party in the Legislative Yuan for the first time.</P>
      <P>Tsai left for the United States Tuesday evening to brief
American scholars and politicians on Taiwan's political situation
and policy direction in the wake of the Dec. 1 elections.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's rising joblessness has spread to
the white-collar sector, with executive unemployment in October
surging to a record high of 2.54 percent, according to a
recent newspaper report.</P>
      <P>Citing statistics compiled by the Directorate General of Budget,
Accounting and Statistics, the China Times report said Monday that
the ratio represents a growth of 1.01 percentage points over the
January level. It also said that the job vacancy rate for executives
had reached around 9.98 percent and called this an indication that
there is a gap between demand and supply in the sector.</P>
      <P>According to www.CTCareer.com.tw, a local executive research
Website, middle-aged job seekers accounted for 26 percent of those
searching for jobs on the Internet. Around 40 percent of the job
opportunities offered for executives were in mainland China and those
aged over 45 were said to have little chance of getting an interview.</P>
      <P>One manager at a consulting company claimed that the chances of
executives aged over 50 getting a foot in the door on a job search
are only 10 percent of the chances in the past. He said more than 50
percent of new jobs are in mainland China -- mainly in the hi-tech
manufacturing sector -- and that new job opportunities for middle-

      <P>According to www.104.com.tw, another job-related Website,
middle-aged job seekers have to wait at least three months for a new

dishonestly reported his property holdings to the Control Yuan in

rather than in the yet-to-be built Pinnan Industrial Park in southern
Tainan County.</P>
      <P>Although the bureau said it had not been officially notified of
the change in plan, it noted that the information it has received
shows that the CSC may be abandoning its original plan because the
development plan of the Pinnan Industrial Park remains uncertain due
to rising environmental protection awareness and the recession.</P>
      <P>According to the bureau, it is vital for the CSC to set up large
mills if it wants to maintain its competitiveness in the face of the
prevailing trend of mergers in Japan and the United States.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Minister of National
Defense Wu Shih-wen urged Tuesday the establishment of a mechanism to
prevent war across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Speaking in Taipei at the International Symposium on National
Security and Military Strategy organized by the National Defense
University, Wu said that it is not easy to break the stalemate
between Taiwan and mainland China, mainly because of political
factors and the lack of mutual understanding and trust.</P>
      <P>Under these circumstance, he said, the two sides should learn
from the experiences of European countries and set up a mutually
acceptable mechanism to prevent conflict.</P>
      <P>"This would be to the benefit of the people on either side of the
Taiwan Strait," said Wu.</P>
      <P>He said that the ROC armed forces have sufficient strength to
protect the country and the people, as mainland China still refuses
to renounce use of military force against Taiwan, but he added that
the measures taken by some Western countries to prevent conflict
could also be borrowed.</P>
      <P>He further said that through the promotion of research and
discussion by scholars, the two sides of the Taiwan Strait would be
able to build up mutual trust.</P>
      <P>Regarding Japan's recent move to enact a new law empowering the
government to dispatch forces abroad to help the U.S. forces against
the Taliban regime in Afghanistan, Wu said this indicates that Japan,
to some extent, is attempting to increase its influence in the Asian
region and even the world.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.S. ANALYST SEES LITTLE CHANCE OF REOPENED CROSS-STRAIT TALKS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New  York,  Dec. 10 (CNA)
(By Jennifer Huang &amp; Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A U.S. analyst of China affairs said in
New York Monday that there is little chance of Beijing resuming talks
with Taiwan, despite the fact that the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) made significant gains in the recent legislative
elections.</P>
      <P>Andrew J. Nathan, professor at the Graduate School of East Asian
Studies at Columbia University, noted that it seems impossible that
Beijing will make major concessions on cross-strait issues and added
that the differences between the two sides remain great.</P>
      <P>He said Beijing is unlikely to resume bilateral negotiations with
Taiwan -- which have been stalled since the second half of 1999 -- as
doing so would have a favorable effect on Republic of China President
Chen Shui-bian's 2004 re-election bid.</P>
      <P>Nathan visited Taiwan for one week to observe the campaigns for
the Dec. 1 legislative and local elections through the arrangement of
his student Hsiao Bi-khim, a legislator elected in the Dec. 1
elections to represent the DPP from among the overseas Chinese
candidates.</P>
      <P>Some analysts have said that the sharp increase in the number of
legislative seats held by the DPP will increase the chance of Chen's
re-election in 2004, but Nathan disagreed, pointing out that Taiwan's
economy remains unpredictable while the DPP's support is only between
35 percent and 39 percent.</P>
      <P>The power of the pan-blue alliance cannot be underestimated, he
went on, especially if People First Party Chairman James Soong (a
former KMT secretary-general) or Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou of the
Kuomintang decide to run for the presidency in 2004.</P>
      <P>He further predicted that Beijing will continue taking steps to
exert pressure on Chen and the Taiwan people.</P>

      <P>A Hong Kong Internet company backed by

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN TO SELL 24.93 MILLION MOBILE PHONES NEXT YEAR</HEADLINE>

(By David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan has delivered 12.89 million mobile
phones to clients so far this year, an increase of 33.8 percent over
last year, according to statistics released Tuesday by the Institute
for Information Industry (III).</P>
      <P>The III estimated that the total for 2002 will be 24.93 million,
an increase of 93.4 percent from this year.</P>
      <P>The III estimated Taiwan's cellular phone production value this
year at US$857 million, a growth of 11.2 percent from last year.</P>
      <P>However, it predicted that production value next year will
register a significant growth of 88.3 percent to reach US$1.614
billion.</P>
      <P>It based its forecast on the premise that the global economy is
expected to begin a recovery and that the market share of the high
profile GPRS (general packet radio service) cellular phones will
account for a certain proportion of the market.</P>
      <P>III adviser Wu Hsien-tung said that because of the global
recession, Taiwan's cellular phone deliveries in the first half of
this year stood at just 4.474 million with a value of US$369 million,
up 7.5 percent and 7 percent from the respective figures of the same
period of last year, respectively.</P>
      <P>Due to the fall of OEM prices, production value in the second
half of this year only reached US$488 million, an increase of 32.25
percent from the first half of the year and a growth of 14.6 percent
from a year earlier, according to the III statistics.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FARMING PRODUCTION TO SHRINK US $ 715.94 MILLION AFTER WTO ENTRY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  12  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Council of Agriculture Chairman Chen
Hsi-huang said Wednesday that Taiwan's agricultural production will
decline an estimated NT$24.7 billion (US$715.94 million) in the first
year of its accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO).</P>
      <P>Fielding questions at a meeting of the Legislative Yuan's
Economic Affairs Committee, Chen said the agricultural sector will
bear the brunt of possible fallout from the island's WTO entry at
the beginning of next year.</P>
      <P>According to the COA's estimate, Chen said, sales
reductions resulting from the mandatory market opening following the
WTO entry would cause a decrease of at least NT$24.7 billion in
agricultural production in 2002.</P>
      <P>To cope with the anticipated challenges, Chen said the COA has
set up three funds to help local farmers tide over their
difficulties.</P>
      <P>Due to the government's financial straits, Chen said, the COA
only sets aside a budget of NT$2.3 billion in fiscal 2002 for
helping farmers victimized by an anticipated influx of cheap foreign
agricultural products in the wake of the island's WTO
accession.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Chen said the Cabinet has promised to offer
additional funds if the budget is used up.</P>

    <HEADLINE>QUEBEC SUPREME COURT ORDERS NEWSPAPER TO STOP SLANDERING FALUNG GONG</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa, Nov. 11 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>In an unprecedented move, Quebec's Superior
Court on Monday ordered a Montreal-based Chinese language newspaper
to stop publishing and circulating anti-Falun Gong hate messages.</P>
      <P>Judge Danielle Grenier ordered Bing He of the weekly Les Presses
Chinoises not to cause to be published or circulated material either
written by her or provided by any other source that slanders Falun
Gong, its founder or its practitioners.</P>
      <P>The court warned that failure to comply with the judgment could
result in penalties and sanctions provided by law.</P>
      <P>Last Thursday, Falun Gong practitioners in Canada began their
first legal action to stop the circulation of hate literature after
what they termed slanderous articles began to appear in the Montreal
Chinese-language newspaper Nov. 3, 2001.</P>
      <P>Yumin Yang, a spokesman for Montreal Falun Gong practitioners,
alleged that the weekly carried articles by Bing He as well as other
messages, in the form of advertisements or editorials, that included
"extremely base and vicious" language aimed at defaming and attacking
Falun Gong, a practice of meditation and exercise with teachings of
the universal principle of "Truthfulness-Compassion-Tolerance."</P>
      <P>The accused newspaper, published every Saturday, is circulated in
Montreal and Ottawa as well as on the Internet. The alleged hate
literature appearing in Les Presses Chinoises repeats language used
by the Communist Chinese government to demonize Falun Gong and
justify its two and a half-year-long persecution of Falun Gong
practitioners in China.</P>
      <P>While the case is still in progress, the court's Safeguard Order
in the preliminary hearing Monday signified an initial success for
the practitioners in their legal action.</P>
      <P>Canadian practitioners said the mainland Chinese government has
been waging a smear campaign both on the mainland and abroad to
justify its crackdown. They said the Chinese Embassy and Consulates
in Canada have been inciting hate toward Falun Gong by sending
defamatory material to officials at all levels of government in
Canada.

(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan businesspeople interested in
investing in mainland China have been warned against having
expectations that are too high regarding the advantages of mainland
China's admission into the World Trade Organization (WTO).</P>
      <P>Chen Ping, a businessman-turned-writer with several best sellers
on mainland China's business opportunities, said that the Beijing
authorities need to revise at least 2,300 laws and regulations to
meet the WTO requirements.</P>
      <P>He said that many Taiwan businesspeople have found that one of
the biggest challenges in doing business in mainland China is
figuring out the ambiguous laws and regulations.</P>
      <P>Taiwan businesspeople are likely to meet even more severe
competition from foreign investors in mainland China who have shown
increasing enthusiasm in that marketplace following Beijing's
admission into the WTO, according to Chen.</P>
      <P>In the past years, Taiwan manufacturers have helped mainland
China's manufacturing industry boost its production capabilities.
Mainland China-made industrial products, ranging from low-end
bicycles to high-end electronic products, have been very competitive
in the international market.</P>
      <P>However, Chen said, many Taiwan businesspeople in mainland China
have found their mainland Chinese counterparts fearful.</P>
      <P>Day Sheng-tong, chairman of the National Association of Small &amp;
Medium Enterprises, also expressed his concern that Taiwan
manufacturers who have moved their product processing lines to
mainland China will meet strong competition from their mainland
Chinese counterparts when Beijing succeeds in upgrading its
industrial structure.</P>
      <P>Day said that 75 percent of the world's umbrellas were
manufactured in Taiwan 10 years ago but that now 75 percent are
manufactured on the mainland by Taiwan businesspeople. He pointed out
that 10 years ago, a dozen umbrellas cost US$23, but now only costs
US$8, saying that this example shows that Taiwan manufacturers must
devise ways to increase their competitiveness.</P>
      <P>Day called on Taiwan manufacturers to learn from the experiences
of those businesspeople who have operated businesses on the other
side of the Taiwan Strait for more than a decade.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Foreign Affairs Tien Hung-mao
confirmed Wednesday that Vice President Annette Lu will leave for The
Gambia next Tuesday to attend the West African state's presidential
inauguration on behalf of President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>Tien told lawmakers at a Legislative Yuan committee meeting that
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) has not arranged for Lu to
visit any other Republic of China allies in West Africa during her
trip.</P>
      <P>On her way home, she will have to make a transit stop in a West
European country, but as the country does not maintain formal
diplomatic ties with the ROC, Tien said, some technical problems have
yet to be resolved. He did not identify the country in question.</P>
      <P>"As a result, Lu's itinerary has not yet been fully finalized,"
Tien said, adding that the MOFA will keep Lu's whole travel schedule
simple.</P>
      <P>According to the MOFA plans, Tien said, Vice Minister of Foreign
Affairs Chiu Jung-nan will accompany Lu on her Gambia visit, along
with an entourage of fewer than 20 people.</P>
      <P>Two ROC Central American allies -- Nicaragua and Honduras -- will
also hold presidential inaugurations next month, one in early January

    <HEADLINE>RESIDENCY QUOTA RESTRICTIONS ON MAINLAND SPOUSES LARGELY EASED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Dec.  12  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland Chinese spouses of Taiwan
residents will no longer have to wait for at least 15 years to obtain
permanent residency in Taiwan under a new package of regulations to
be put into force at the beginning of next year.</P>
      <P>At its weekly meeting Wednesday, the Cabinet approved the new
package, which greatly eases quota restrictions on mainland spouses
intending to settle in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>While the annual residency quota for mainland Chinese people who
have been married to Taiwan residents for two years or who have given
birth will remain at 3,600 under the new system, a new category of
mainland spouses will also be granted permanent residency.</P>
      <P>The new category covers mainland spouses who have been on the
quota waiting list for more than four years and whose accumulated
legal length of stay in Taiwan after marriage has exceeded two years.</P>
      <P>"This category of mainland spouses will be granted legal
residency from 2002 and they will not be subject to any annual quota
restrictions," said a Ministry of the Interior (MOI) official.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the new measure is being implemented out of
humanitarian considerations, the official said about 2,300 mainland
spouses will be eligible to obtain permanent residency in the coming
year.</P>
      <P>Intermarriage across the Taiwan Strait has increased steadily
over the past decade, resulting in the swelling of the residency
waiting list. The new measure is expected to help improve the
situation, the official said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, mainland Chinese people who married Taiwan residents
on or before Dec. 31, 1949 will continue to be free of any quota
restrictions regarding permanent residency applications under the new
package.</P>
      <P>In addition, the annual quota for mainland Chinese people who
intend to take up residence in Taiwan for political, economic,
social, educational, technological or cultural reasons will be
increased to 60 from 2002.</P>
      <P>According to MOI estimates, about 9,500 mainland Chinese people
will be able to obtain legal residency in Taiwan next year under the
new regulations. The number is estimated to drop to around 9,300 in
2003 and to surge to 11,000 in 2004.</P>
      <P>To prevent human smuggling rings from arranging marriages of
convenience between mainland women and local men so that the women
can obtain legal Taiwan residency, the official went on, the MOI is
considering establishing a screening mechanism that will require
those who intend to marry mainland Chinese people to be interviewed
face-to-face by relevant government officials.</P>
      <P>The interviewing officials are expected to remind Taiwan people
of government regulations and the problems that may arise from tying
the knot with a mainlander, the official added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CABINET APPROVES 2002 NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  12  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet approved Wednesday Taiwan's
economic development plan for 2002, with the annual gross domestic
product (GDP) growth rate projected at 2.7 percent.</P>
      <P>According to the 2002 national development plan drafted by the
Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD), Taiwan's
unemployment rate for the coming year is estimated at 4.5 percent and
the employment growth rate at 1.2 percent.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet-level council also forecast that the domestic
inflation rate will maintain this year's level of 0.1 percent.</P>
      <P>The plan places priority on revitalizing the ailing economy,
increasing job openings and lowering the unemployment rate for the
new year.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the plan, the government will stimulate
economic growth by encouraging innovation and expanding public
investment, while GDP growth, coupled with structural adjustments,
will in turn increase job opportunities.</P>
      <P>The plan also outlines five major national development goals for
the new year -- upgrading Taiwan's competitiveness with a global
perspective; reinvigorating Taiwan's vitality with sustainable
management; boosting social justice through improved law and order,
medical services, a social security system and cultural development;
upgrading administrative efficiency by wiping out corruption and
"black gold" politics; and strengthening human resources by raising
educational levels.</P>
      <P>The CEPD also presented a review of the domestic and global
economic situations at the Cabinet meeting in which it predicted that
the global economic growth rate will decline from last year's 4
percent to 1.3 percent this year.</P>
      <P>On the domestic front, the CEPD said the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks on the United States and the trail of devastation left by
typhoons Toraji and Nari have hindered Taiwan's economic recovery in
the second half of this year.</P>
      <P>As a result, the report said, Taiwan's unemployment rate has
continued to rise, pushing up the annual jobless rate to an estimated
4.5 percent.</P>
      <P>On the economic outlook for 2002, the report said as major
countries around the world have adopted easy monetary and
fiscal policies to rev up their sluggish economies, the world
economy will gradually regain steam in the first half of the new
year, which will be a boon to Taiwan's export-driven economy.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAC DEPUTY CHIEF CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC ABOUT CROSS-STRAIT TIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  12  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Vice
Chairman Lin Chong-pin expressed cautious optimism Wednesday about
interaction between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait in the coming
year.</P>
      <P>Lin told local reporters after attending an international seminar
on national security and military strategy that he thinks that
cross-strait dialogue may resume after Taiwan's Cabinet is reshuffled
early next year.</P>
      <P>"The two sides are most likely to resume talks during the
interval from the inauguration of Taiwan's new Cabinet to mainland
China's annual Beidaihe meeting," Lin said.</P>
      <P>Lin was referring to the mainland Chinese leadership meeting that
takes place each summer at Beidaihe, a resort on the outskirts of
Beijing.</P>
      <P>In his view, Lin said, there will be a "window of opportunity"
during this period. "More specifically, the suitable period for the
two sides to resume dialogue ranges between February and April next
year," he noted.</P>
      <P>Lin said he hopes both sides can take advantage of this
opportunity. "Otherwise, the chance will slip away," he added.</P>
      <P>Lin's optimistic forecast came a day after MAC Chairwoman Tsai
Ing-wen made a similar prediction.</P>
      <P>Lin said although the two sides have not yet come to terms on the
"one China" issue, the general situations on both sides are favorable
for resumption of cross-strait talks.</P>
      <P>For one thing, Lin said, mainland China's political, economic and
social situations are generally good and its relations with the
United States have stabilized in the second half of this year.</P>
      <P>"Mainland China is more willing to deal with cross-strait issues
when its domestic and diplomatic situations, particularly its
relations with the United States, are stable," Lin observed.

    <HEADLINE>CONTROL YUAN TO RELEASE REPORT ON CAPTAIN'S YIN'S DEATH NEXT YEAR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 12 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Control Yuan's report on the mysterious
death of a naval captain in 1993 will be released early next year,
said Tu Shan-liang, secretary-general of the Control Yuan.</P>
      <P>In a response to questions from local journalists, Tu said the
Control Yuan's investigation into the death of Captain Yin Ching-feng
and the scandal surrounding the ROC Navy's purchase of six
French-made Lafayett-class frigates in 1991 is substantially
completed.</P>
      <P>However, Tu said, the investigation took a strange twist earlier
this year when Andrew Wang, an arms broker who fled to the United
States after being wanted in Taiwan in connection with the death of
Yin, relayed a letter to the Control Yuan through his contacts in
Taiwan proclaiming his innocence. Control Yuan members are looking
into the details of Wang's letter which have not been made public.</P>
      <P>Also, documents from France obtained by Control Yuan
investigators earlier this year need to be further examined by
government agencies to certify their authenticity, Tu said.</P>
      <P>All this takes extra time, Tu said, but the Control Yuan is also
aware that the public is eager for an early conclusion to the
investigation and that they have been waiting for the final report.</P>
      <P>Captain Yin, whose dead body was found floating in a harbor near
a navy base in northern Taiwan in 1993, was in charge of the navy's
weapons acquisitions and had threatened to go public with what he
called irregularities involving in navy's purchases before his sudden
death.</P>
      <P>The navy launched its own probe into the death, but no
conclusions were reached. The entire investigation all but came to a
halt before civilian police stepped in to take over the case.</P>
      <P>Investigators have been able to put some pieces of the puzzle
together. In Paris, French authorities in 1996 found the country's
former foreign minister, Roland Dumas, had been paid to approve the
sale of the six frigates to Taiwan in 1991.</P>
      <P>The finding gave new life to the case in Taiwan and investigators
renewed their efforts to put together events that could have led to
the death of Yin. The probe expanded to include allegations of
purchasing irregularities surrounding the French frigates.</P>
      <P>The Control Yuan began its own investigations this year and have
questioned several prominent navy officials.</P>
      <P>One interesting discovery was the fact that recordings of
telephone conversations at the General Headquarters of the Navy
immediately before and after Yin's death had been taped over by
unrelated conversations.</P>
      <P>Another was a tape secretly recorded by Captain Yin allegedly to
be used as evidence of the purchasing irregularities by the General
Headquarters of the Navy. The tape surfaced, only to be found to have
been corrupted to the point that the speech on the tape was not
understandable.</P>
      <P>Many navy officials who were first questioned in connection with
Yin's death were either retired or assigned to other jobs immediately
afterward.</P>
      <P>All these have complicated the investigations, Tu said, and
raised suspicions that at least one person in the navy was trying to
prevent the truth from coming out.</P>
      <P>A parallel investigation by a panel of prosecutors has turned up
no evidence of alleged kickbacks in the purchase of the frigates thus
far, and no one has been arrested for the murder of Yin.</P>

Confucius' lesson of the day: "If in governing you depend upon
laws and maintain order by enforcing those laws by punishments, you
can also make the people keep away from wrongdoing, but they will
lose the sense of shame for wrongdoing. If, on the other hand, in
government you depend upon moral sentiment and maintain order by
encouraging education and good manners, the people will have a sense
of shame for wrongdoing and, moreover, will emulate what is good."</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>ROC OFFICIALS REITERATE TAIWAN'S M'LAND POLICY DURING U.S. VISIT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Dec.  12  (CNA)
(By Jay Chen and Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Senior Republic of China officials
visiting Washington said Wednesday that the ROC government's policy
toward mainland China remains unchanged after the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party's emergence from the recent legislative elections
as the largest party in the Legislature.</P>
      <P>ROC Executive Yuan Secretary-General Chiou I-jen told reporters
at the National Press Club in the U.S. capital that the ROC
government continues to place priority on maintaining peace and
stability in the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Chiou urged Beijing to work together with Taiwan toward such
ideals and toward the welfare of "the entire human race."</P>
      <P>He added that any issue can be discussed between Taipei and
Beijing at the negotiating table.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taiwan's top planner on mainland policy told the
reporters that Taiwan must be careful in its words and deeds so as
not to be provocative toward mainland China, which has deployed
missiles aimed at Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Tsai Ing-wen, who is chairwoman of the Mainland Affairs Council,
added that Taipei's basic stance on cross-strait relations includes
ROC President Chen Shui-bian's proposal of aiming to ultimately
achieve political integration through economic and cultural
integration, as well as the "five noes" as spelled out in his
inauguration speech.</P>
      <P>Namely, the five noes are: no declaration of independence as long
as Beijing does not intend to use force against the island, no change
in the nation's official name, no adoption of the "state-to-state"
theory into the ROC Constitution, no referendum on the fate of the
nation in regard to the unification versus independence issue during
his term in office, and no abrogation of the Guidelines for National
Unification.</P>
      <P>The ROC officials were on a three-day visit at the invitation of
the Heritage Foundation to brief U.S. scholars and politicians on
Taiwan's political situation and policy direction in the wake of the
Dec. 1 elections which made the Democratic Progressive Party the
party with the most seats in the Legislative Yuan for the first time.</P>
      <P>The delegation also included Presidential Office Deputy
Secretary-General Eugene Chien and Wu An-chia, an official with the
Coordination Council for North American Affairs under the ROC
Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CANADIAN MP ACCUSES PRC EMBASSY OF TARGETING MISTRUTHS AT HIM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  Dec.  12  (CNA)
(By S.C. CHANG)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Canadian member of Parliament who is
known for his strong support of Canadian Falun Gong practitioners
accused on Wednesday the Communist Chinese Embassy in Canada of
targeting mistruths at his office.</P>
      <P>Rob Anders made the remark in a statement congratulating Falun
Dafa Canada on a court decision against a Montreal-based
Chinese-language newspaper which the practitioners charge has been
conducting a smear campaign against them by carrying defamatory
articles and advertisements.</P>
      <P>Quebec's Supreme Court on Monday ordered Les Presses Chinoises to
stop publishing and circulating anti-Falun Gong hate messages.</P>
      <P>Anders said the newspaper's propaganda campaign against Falun
Gong and its repetition of what he called the lies of the Embassy of
the People's Republic of China "is shameful."</P>
      <P>He praised the court for issuing "the first ever court order" to
stop the spread of lies, adding such efforts in stopping the
incitement of hatred toward practitioners of Falun Gong makes Canada
a better place.</P>
      <P>"This initial victory sends a strong message that Canada,
governed by the rule of law, will not tolerate such manipulation," he
said.</P>
      <P>"I understand the uphill battle practitioners are facing," he
pointed out, saying that his own office has been a target of
mistruths spread by the Embassy of the People's Republic of China.</P>
      <P>"They have attempted to spread their misrepresentations widely in
Canada, and it is heartening to hear that such practices are
beginning to be stopped," he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP ADMINISTRATION WORKING TOWARD A THREE-BRANCH GOVERNMENT: OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Dec.  12  (CNA)
(By Jay Chen and Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A senior Republic of China official
visiting Washington said Wednesday that the Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) administration will promote government structural reforms
that may include overhauling the five-branch government system such
that only three branches remain in "four to six years."</P>
      <P>Stressing that he was merely reiterating an old proposal, ROC
Executive Yuan Secretary-General Chiou I-jen told reporters at the
National Press Club in the U.S. capital that the DPP has always
wanted to adopt a constitutional system similar to the three-branch
system used in the United States.</P>
      <P>However, Chiou stressed that the process must involve
negotiations with other political parties because of the steep
requirements involved in ratifying the relevant constitutional
amendments.</P>
      <P>Chiou added that the DPP administration hopes to complete the
first stage of government reform next year by ratifying the necessary
amendments to slim down the Executive Yuan by one-third its current
size.</P>
      <P>In response to a question on whether the position of the premier,
who heads the Executive Yuan, would also be abolished in order to set
up an executive branch headed by the president, Chiou said that such
a possibility exists but that the conclusion would depend on
negotiations with other parties.</P>
      <P>The ROC Constitution, promulgated in 1947, installed a complex
system of checks and balances between five branches of government --
the Executive Yuan, the Legislative Yuan, the Judicial Yuan, the
Examination Yuan and the Control Yuan -- with a president serving as
the head of state.</P>
      <P>Chiou is on a three-day visit to brief U.S. scholars and
politicians on Taiwan's political situation and policy direction in
the wake of the recent elections which made the DPP the party with
the most seats in the Legislative Yuan for the first time.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FARMERS FORMING ALLIANCES TO MEET INTERNATIONAL COMPETITION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  13  (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Cooperation between mango growers in
southern Taiwan has resulted in improved production and increased
profits this year and is just one example of the benefits of
stratigic alliances in the agricultural sector, according to Council
of Agriculture (COA) Chairman Chen Hsi-huang.</P>
      <P>Chen said that in the past several months, 12 strategic alliances
have been formed among floricultural farmers, fruit growers,
aquaculture farmers, dairy farmers and farm families engaged in
agri-tourism.</P>
      <P>Under the framework of the Taiwan Agricultural Strategic
Coalition, the alliances have improved the production and marketing
efficiencies of most small farms.</P>
      <P>The COA is encouraging farmers to cooperate in production and
product processing and distribution to enhance the efficiency of
their operations.</P>
      <P>Mango growers in southern Taiwan have been especially pleased
with this year's harvest and the assistance given by the Tainan
Region Mango Growers Strategic Alliance.</P>
      <P>The eight mango-growing townships and villages in Tainan County
had fallen on hard times in recent years with overproduction that had
led to cut-throat competition and entire seasons without showing a
profit. In March this year, agricultural officials talked to
executives of the farmers' associations in the region and recommended
that they form a production and marketing alliance.</P>
      <P>Before last summer's harvest, farmers in the region had
established a marketing mechanism with the assistance of the Taiwan
Agricultural Strategic Coalition, which was set up by the COA in
November last year to coordinate farmers' associations and
cooperatives and help small farms facing the challenges of
international competition.</P>
      <P>Chen said that Taiwan's small farms had been too vulnerable to
meet the challenges of a more open international market.</P>
      <P>However, with the proper organization, Taiwan's agricultural
sector should be able to expand into the international market and not
just take a defensive posture, he said.</P>
      <P>As a member of the World Trade Organization (WTO), Taiwan will be
required to lift the protective restrictions that have been in place
for the benefit of local farmers and growers, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Anticipating the unprecedented impact after entry in the WTO,
many farm households have sought to make adjustments in their
production and management over the past few years. Some rice growers
have shifted to specialty crops with higher yields and better market
value. Agri-tourism is another alternative for farm households to
improve their incomes.</P>

    <HEADLINE>OFFICIAL'S PROPOSAL FOR THREE-BRANCH GOVERNMENT DRAWS MIXED RESPONSES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 13 (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A remark by Cabinet Secretary-General Chiou
I-jen that the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) administration aims
to promote a three-branch governmental system over the next four to
six years drew mixed responses from government officials and
political parties Thursday.</P>
      <P>Chiou told reporters Wednesday at the National Press Club in
Washington that the DPP has always wanted to adopt a constitutional
system similar to the three-branch system used in the United States,
instead of the five-branch system currently in place according to the
Republic of China Constitution.</P>
      <P>In response to Chiou's remark, Presidential Office Public Affairs
Director Kuo Yao-chi said that working toward a three-branch
government system is an important direction of development that might
be discussed within the framework of a recently established
government restructuring committee or a "national stabilization
alliance" proposed by President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>The government restructuring committee is headed by the
president, and includes as vice chairmen Premier Chang Chun-hsiung --
who is head of the Executive Yuan -- and Examination Yuan President
Hsu Shui-teh.</P>
      <P>The ROC Constitution, promulgated in 1947, installed a complex
system of checks and balances between five branches of government --
the Executive Yuan, the Legislative Yuan, the Judicial Yuan, the
Examination Yuan and the Control Yuan -- while a president serves as
the head of state.</P>
      <P>Examination Yuan Vice Secretary-General Tsai Liang-wen said that
the planned reforms are aimed at maximizing the government's
effectiveness. Such restructuring will go through several stages,
beginning with a slimming down of the Executive Yuan and gradually
spreading to include the other four Yuans, he said, adding that the
possibility of involving changes to the constitutional system cannot
be ruled out.</P>
      <P>A Control Yuan official said that Control Yuan President Fredrick
Chien has already established a special task force within the Yuan to
gather related information domestically and from abroad to evaluate
the issue of whether the Control Yuan should be abolished.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, opposition People First Party Chairman James Soong
criticized Chiou, saying it was unheard of that a Cabinet chief of
staff would say that the premier's post "might disappear."</P>
      <P>Chiou had told reporters in response to a question on whether the
position of the premier would be abolished to set up an executive
branch headed solely by the president, that such a possibility exists
but that the conclusion would depend on negotiations with other
parties.</P>
      <P>Lee Cheng-chong, a legislative whip of the opposition Kuomintang
(KMT), said that his party supports the existing five-branch
government constitutional system. However, Lee went on, the KMT will
offer its support if a new system is "a good system." Whether the
three-branch government is feasible can be discussed, he added.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislative Whip Tsai Huang-liang said that constitutional
amendments involve a wide-ranging number of issues, and that public
opinion as well as opposition parties must be consulted.</P>
      <P>Noting that although a three-branch government is indeed a
long-time proposal of his party, DPP legislator Shen Fu-hsiung said
that a move to focus executive power on the president -- thereby
marginalizing or eliminating the premier -- has not yet received
overwhelming support within the DPP legislative caucus.</P>
      <P>Stressing that it is necessary to work toward amending the
Constitution to establish a three-branch government, DPP legislator
Lin Cho-shui said that the president-versus-premier issue remains to
be discussed within his party and within society.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA)
said Thursday that it has not decided whether to allow Taiwan's
eight-inch wafer chip manufacturers and IC packaging and designers to
invest in mainland China.</P>
      <P>Vice Economic Affairs Minister Chen Ruey-long made the remarks
after a four-hour meeting with industry leaders over which he
presided.</P>
      <P>Chen added, however, that the ministry had decided to allow
light-emitting diode (LED) and liquid crystal display (LCD) module
(LCM) makers to invest in the mainland.</P>
      <P>Chen said that as investment in wafer chip manufacture is
enormous and it is the most important industry in Taiwan, it is
necessary to establish a management mechanism before allowing such
companies to invest in the mainland.</P>
      <P>The MOEA and the Taiwan Semiconductor Industry Association will
invite related industry leaders for more discussions and will take
into consideration the capital risk and industry competitiveness
across the Taiwan Strait before mapping out a management mechanism
and making a final decision, he said.</P>
      <P>Those participating in the discussion were Wu Ming-chiu,
representative of the Taiwan Electrical &amp; Electronics Manufacturers
Association and president of Macronix International, Taiwan
Semiconductor Industry Association Secretary-General Chen Wen-hsien,
Taipei Computer Association Chairman Huang Chung-jen and Institution

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Thursday that
the government is confident in its ability to promote the
information-based economy and integrate economic development in the
Asia-Pacific region.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks at a reception for young Chinese business
leaders from Taiwan and overseas.</P>
      <P>The president lauded the young business leaders for creating
unlimited possibilities from the most inferior conditions, which he
termed the "spirit of Taiwan's sons."</P>
      <P>He further said that entrepreneurship is Taiwan's spirit and that
the future of Taiwan hinges upon it. Noting that Taiwan's small- and
medium-sized enterprises created an economic miracle in the past, the
nation in future will have to rely on knowledge, technology and
creativity if it wants to continue to enjoy a competitive edge on the
world stage.</P>
      <P>He stressed that the present time is crucial and that the key to
its success will be the integration of the government and private
sectors. He said that the government should allow the nation's
entrepreneurs to make the best use of their potential and create a
sound investment environment.</P>
      <P>He reiterated that the government will implement the conclusions
reached at the Economic Development Advisory Conference in August and
listen to private entrepreneurs.</P>
      <P>The president also spoke of the just-concluded legislative and
county and city chief elections, saying that the government is not
elated by its election victory, but in fact is more humble and more
prepared to listen to the voice of the grassroots and think about the
future of the country.</P>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party gained 87 seats in the

    <HEADLINE>VP LOOKING INTO REPORTS ON WPCM HEAD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  13  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The office of Vice President Annette Lu
said Thursday that it is looking into reports that the South Korean
organizer of the World Peace Corps Mission (WPCM), which awarded a
prize to Lu in Taipei last week, is a "con man."</P>
      <P>A press release from Lu's office said that the vice president
will reveal her findings after checking the press report.</P>
      <P>The press statement said a report in Next magazine, a local
weekly, about a bungled business deal between Han Min Su, co-founder
of the WPCM, and the island Kingdom of Tonga, seems to be about Han's
private business and nothing to do with the organization he help
found in 1983.</P>
      <P>However, the statement said that the same magazine's report about
former U.S. Congressman Lester Wolff, who serves as chief judge of
the WPCM's prize-awarding council and who presented its World Peace
Prize to Lu on Dec. 4, is "not based on fact" and is "unfair" to the
long-time human rights activist.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile Kuo Yao-chi, director of the Public Affairs Office
under the Presidential Office, said Thursday that prize or no prize,
Lu's contributions to peace are widely acknowledged.</P>
      <P>However, Kuo said the Presidential Office had nothing to do with
the affair and that although the prize was awarded in the auditorium
of the Presidential Office, the arrangements were made by Lu's staff.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Chang Siao-yue said that
the WPCM is a civic organization registered in Washington and that
while the Foreign Ministry helped it to organize the presentation of
the prize to Lu, it did not offer any financial help.</P>
      <P>Chang said that Wolff last month contacted Taiwan's
representative in Washington, Chen Chien-jen, to tell him that Lu had
been chosen to receive the peace prize.</P>
      <P>The Foreign Ministry served as a conduit between the vice
president and the WPCM, but neither recommended Lu as prize winner
nor asked the organization to honor the vice president and did not
mention giving any funds to the WPCM.</P>
      <P>According to Next magazine, Han Min Su is a con man who offered
King of Tonga Taufa'ahau Tupou IV the peace prize in 1996 and tried
to win Tupou's approval for Tonga to buy from him a plant touted to
be able to convert sea water into natural gas.</P>
      <P>The deal turned out to be a confidence trick and Seoul was later
forced to apologize to the Kingdom of Tonga, the magazine said.</P>
      <P>The weekly also cited AFP correspondent Field Michael as saying
he believes Han is trying to play a similar trick on Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The magazine also disputed Han's claims that his organization
awarded the WPCM peace prize to Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin in 1995.</P>
      <P>The magazine said that Wolff, who came to Lu's defense when she
was tried for sedition in 1979, quit politics 21 years ago after
losing a re-election bid.</P>

(By Edward Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Experts said Thursday that Kaohsiung
City will have bright prospects once Taiwan and mainland China are
admitted into the World Trade Organization (WTO).</P>
      <P>Associate Professor Lee Liang-chien of the Financial Department
of I-Shou University said that according to the results of a survey
he commissioned, a majority of the respondents said they attach great
importance to the opening of direct postal, trade and transport links
across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The results also show that the respondents believe hikes in labor
costs and repeated confrontations between those who wish to exploit
the environment and those who want to preserve something of Taiwan's
natural resources are two key factors prompting local enterprises to
move away from Taiwan, Lee said.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, Kaohsiung City, which possesses Kaohsiung Port
and Kaohsiung International Airport, will be more competitive than
other cities in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that Kaohsiung badly needs promotional talent and
suggested that the city should set up a task force charged with
encouraging foreign investors to put their money into Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>Chen Hai-ni, board chairman of the Kaohsiung City Tourist Hotel
Association, said that Kaohsiung should develop its tourism industry
and expressed hope that the government will open the Taiwan tourism
market to mainland Chinese people as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Citing Hong Kong as an example, he claimed that the tourism
industry has continued to develop since the former British colony
reverted to mainland Chinese rule in 1997.</P>
      <P>Lee Wen-liang, director of the Construction Bureau of Kaohsiung
City, said that Kaohsiung will develop its software, bio-tech and
tourist industries.</P>
      <P>He also said that the mass rapid transport system currently under
construction will help build Kaohsiung into a multifunctional
international city.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIPEI, BEIJING CAN BUILD TRUST THROUGH WTO FRAMEWORK: ROC OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Dec.  13 (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung and Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei has no intention of discussing
political issues with Beijing within the World Trade Organization
(WTO) framework but believes the two sides can build trust and
develop rules of mutual engagement through WTO trade discussions, an
ROC official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen said in a speech
delivered at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative Washington think
tank, that the possibility of increasing trust and developing mutual
engagement rules already exists but remains dependent on whether
leaders in Beijing are willing to explore such a possibility.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's top planner on mainland China policy pointed out that
the most difficult part will be the process of finding common
interests and beginning a dialogue.</P>
      <P>Tsai said that WTO entry represents a major opportunity for the
two sides of the Taiwan Strait to interact in a more structured and
systematic manner, helping to stabilize bilateral relations and allow
both sides to focus on their own respective internal reforms.</P>
      <P>She said that the relationship between Taiwan and mainland China
is complex and requires careful handling because the mainland is both
a source of military intimidation and a trading partner for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Bilateral interaction will be checked by the international
community's common expectations, she said, adding that both
governments will face new challenges in the wake of their WTO entry
due to the tremendous changes that will occur to their domestic
economies and to their political and social structures.</P>
      <P>"If the two governments are unable to face these challenges, the
damage brought about by WTO entry will exceed the benefits," she
noted.</P>
      <P>Tsai also reiterated that the Republic of China government's
mainland policy remains focused on maintaining peace and stability
without provoking Beijing despite political differences.</P>
      <P>She added that Taipei's basic stance on cross-strait relations
also includes ROC President Chen Shui-bian's proposal of aiming to
ultimately achieve political integration through economic and
cultural integration, as well as the "five noes" as spelled out in
his inauguration speech.</P>
      <P>Namely, the five noes are: no declaration of independence as long
as Beijing does not intend to use force against the island, no change
in the nation's official name, no adoption of the "state-to-state"
theory into the ROC Constitution, no referendum on the fate of the
nation in regard to the unification versus independence issue during
his term in office, and no abrogation of the Guidelines for National
Unification.</P>
      <P>Tsai is on a three-day visit to the U.S. capital to brief U.S.
scholars and politicians on Taiwan's political situation and policy
direction in the wake of the Dec. 1 elections which made the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party the party with the most seats in the
Legislative Yuan for the first time.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAC DEPUTY CHIEF STRESSES SIGNIFICANCE OF INTERMEDIARY CHANNELS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  14  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Vice
Chairman Lin Chong-pin urged Beijing Friday to make the most of the
existing intermediary channels across the Taiwan Strait and
contribute to constructive interactions between the two sides.</P>
      <P>Lin called for the Beijing authorities to take advantage of the
functions of the Taiwan-based Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) and
its Beijing counterpart, the Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Strait (ARATS), which were established in February and
December 1991, respectively, by the governments on the two sides as
intermediary arms for formal dialogue on issues pertaining to
cross-strait affairs.</P>
      <P>The MAC deputy chief stressed that Taiwan's invitation to ARATS
Chairman Wang Daohan for a formal visit to Taiwan remains open and
will continue to remain open in the hopes that the mainland Chinese
authorities will make the most of the two intermediary bodies to
resume cross-strait dialogue which has been suspended since 1996.</P>
      <P>Lin said that regardless of how much cross-strait relations have
fluctuated in recent years, the Taiwan public's support for the
invitation to Wang has remained high in all public opinion polls.</P>
      <P>He added that the MAC will continue to create "windows of
opportunity" for the resumption of cross-strait dialogue and to call
for Beijing to make a favorable response to Taiwan's initiative.</P>
      <P>Noting that the two sides do not lack formal intermediary bodies
to resume cross-strait dialogue, Lin said the only thing at present
that is required is a positive response from Beijing.</P>
      <P>Lin said many practical issues, including protection for Taiwan
investments in mainland China, intellectual property rights
protection, the repatriation of illegal mainland Chinese immigrants,
judicial assistance and agricultural cooperation, remain urgently in
need of being tackled by the participation of officials from both
sides.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GOVERNMENT TO STOP PROVIDING AVIATION INSURANCE COVERAGE GUARANTEE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 14 (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government won't continue to provide a
war risk insurance coverage guarantee to domestic airlines after Dec.
25 as the insurance market has gradually returned to normal three
months after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on America, the
transportation ministry said Friday.</P>
      <P>According to a Ministry of Transportation and Communications news
release, domestic airlines should be able to purchase adequate
aviation insurance on the market as other regional airlines in Japan,
the Philippines, Vietnam, Indonesia, Thailand, New Zealand, India and
Bangladesh have already been able to purchase reasonable coverage.</P>
      <P>Therefore, the ministry will not recommend to the Cabinet that it
continue providing the coverage guarantee, the statement added.</P>
      <P>In late September, the Legislative Yuan approved the
administration's plan to provide a 30-day war risk insurance coverage
guarantee to domestic airlines, effective until Oct. 25. That plan
was later extended by one month on two occasions, with the coverage
guarantee now scheduled to end Dec. 25.</P>
      <P>In the wake of the terrorist attacks on America, international
underwriters raised aviation insurance premiums across the board and
slashed the maximum third-party liability compensation from US$1.5
billion per accident to only US$50 million, dealing a major blow to
the world's airline industry.</P>
      <P>The government's financial guarantee gave the nation's airlines
temporary coverage above that amount in the event of any claims
resulting from hijackings or war while giving the companies time to
negotiate new contracts with insurance companies.</P>
      <P>The U.S. government and a number of other governments around the
world also helped their aviation industries through their difficult
times by providing similar assistance.</P>
      <P>Airlines sometimes operate with rented aircraft that come with
contract clauses stating that certain amounts of insurance coverage
must be obtained. If an airline is unable to purchase the adequate
amount of insurance, this is tantamount to breaking the rental
contract, thereby giving the rental companies the legal right to
forcibly repossess the planes.</P>
      <P>An airport could also demand adequate insurance coverage before
allowing a plane to land.</P>

      <P>The family of a young man in eastern
Hualien County who died Wednesday of an accidental fall donated his
organs, benefiting 50 people, doctors said Friday.</P>
      <P>The young man, surnamed Chen, was declared brain dead by doctors
at the Buddhist Tzu Chi Medical Center in Hualien after receiving
emergency treatment Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Chen was confirmed brain dead Thursday after doctors
double-checked his condition and reconfirmed their earlier diagnosis.</P>
      <P>His family then agreed to allow all of Chen's organs to be
donated, whereupon Tzu Chi Medical Center surgeons began harvesting
the organs -- all of which were in good condition because of Chen's
youth.</P>
      <P>Doctors said Chen's kidneys, corneas and skin would be placed in
storage in readiness for transplants to be conducted at the Tzu Chi
Medical Center. His bones were deposited in the Tzu Chi Bone Bank,
while his heart and liver were transferred to National Taiwan
University Hospital in Taipei for transplants there.</P>
      <P>The doctors said that almost all Chen's organs had already been
allocated to recipients, but added that further comparisons will need
to be made in order to find suitable recipients for his lungs.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that Chen's donation will benefit 50 people
awaiting transplants.</P>
      <P>Despite sadness over the death of his son, the senior Chen said
he took comfort from the thought that his son's organs are helping to

      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien
Chan said Friday that the KMT's basic concept remains unchanged
despite the party's upset in the Dec. 1 legislative elections.</P>
      <P>He stressed that the KMT's basic political concept is based on a
middle-of-the-road, rational and reformist way.</P>

      <P>The number of seats held by the KMT in the 225-seat Legislative
Yuan dropped to 68 from a pre-election 110 in the elections earlier

the legislature to the ruling Democratic Progressive Party.</P>
      <P>Several re-elected KMT legislators, including Ho Chih-hui, Chen

continue leading the party, but at least four KMT groups in the

      <P>KMT Secretary-General Lin Fong-cheng agreed with the proposal and

      <P>The government may allow domestic
petrochemical companies to invest in mainland China on a conditional
basis, an official of the Ministry of Economic Affairs said Friday.</P>
      <P>The announcement came after a meeting of a task force comprising
experts and officials in which they discussed whether or not to allow
such investment.</P>
      <P>Vice Economics Minister Chen Ruey-long presided over the meeting
that was also attended by Mainland Affairs Council Vice Chairman Teng
Chen-chung and Chen Wu-hsiung, board chairman of the Petrochemical
Industry Association of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>No conclusion was reached but the committee decided to meet again
within two weeks to review the situation and the government may allow
the local petrochemical industry to invest in mainland China if mass
capital outflow can be controled, the official said.</P>
      <P>Chen said after the meeting that taking into account supply and
demand, the government may consider permitting local petrochemical
industry to invest in the naphtha cracking plant in mainland.</P>
      <P>The construction of seventh and eighth naphtha cracking plants --
which would produce higher quality ethylene -- have been not smoothly
implemented because difficulty with land acquisition, labor, and
environmental protection issues, Chen said.</P>
      <P>However, he went on, the ethylene produced by the second, third
and fourth naphtha cracking plants operated by the Chinese Petroleum
Corp. and the sixth naphtha cracking plant operated by the Formosa
Plastic Group have been able to meet domestic demand, and
petrochemical makers therfore thought they need to invest in the
mainland to expand operations</P>
      <P>Local industry leaders believe investment in the mainland is
essential, but Chen pointed out that enormous amounts of capital are
needed to invest in naphtha crackers. He added that the government
should know about the source of the capital and the type of
investment before giving its permission to local industry.</P>

      <P>The SEF, the quasi-official body authorized by the government to
handle exchanges across the strait in the absence of formal contacts,
made the call in a letter to its mainland counterpart, the
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) upon the
10th anniversary of ARATS' founding.</P>
      <P>SEF Chairman Koo Chen-fu noted that ARATS informed SEF of its
formal inauguration Dec. 16 ten years ago, signaling the opening of
dialogue channels between the two sides.</P>
      <P>Between then and 1995, Koo said, the two organs have held regular
negotiations and have helped solve cross-strait disputes resulting
from increasing civilian exchanges.</P>
      <P>Koo, who met ARATS Chairman Wang Daohan in Singapore in 1993 for
the historic high-level talks, visited Wang again in Shanghai in 1998
and expressed the hope that he and Wang would be able to "sit down
and talk again."</P>
      <P>Beijing unilaterally suspended talks with Taipei following a
visit to the United States by former President Lee Teng-hui 1995.</P>
      <P>He suggested that both sides begin with the building of mutual
trust by resuming the suspended regular talks, which he said would
allow cross-strait ties to move forward.</P>

      <P>A rehearsal for the formal commission of
Taiwan's first F-16 fighter wing was held at Chiayi air force base in
southern Taiwan Friday.</P>
      <P>Air Commander-in-Chief Chen Chao-min presided over an inspection
of the 455th tactical combat aircraft wing stationed at the base

    <HEADLINE>GIO DISPUTES U.N. CLAIMS ABOUT  SEXUAL EXPLOITATION CASES IN TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  De.  14  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>No more than 20,000 women and children in
Taiwan have been victims of sexual abuse over the past five years,
far fewer cases than has been reported by the United Nations Children
Fund (UNICEF), the Government Information Office (GIO) said Friday.</P>
      <P>In a statement in response to a UNICEF report that said that
100,000 women and children were sexually exploited in Taiwan, the GIO
said what constitutes sexual exploitation is controversial, but
according to statistics compiled by police, there were no more than
20,000 victims of sexual offenses in Taiwan between 1997 and October,
2001.</P>
      <P>Only 10,576 females were attacked sexually during this time,
including 6,874 minors, which made up 75 percent of the total
victims, the GIO said.</P>
      <P>In addition, police statistics show that there were 1,889 cases
of sex involving minors; 1,711 minors were subjected to
child-trafficking or were coerced into having sex; 603 minors were
caught serving as hostesses at restaurants that allegedly offered sex
to clients; and 327 children or teenagers were caught working in the
sex industry.</P>
      <P>Although the cases reported to police are always fewer than what
is most likely the actual total, the figures cited by UNICEF are
disproportionally high, the GIO said.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the number of victims of sexual offenses are declining
yearly, said the GIO, citing police statistics as proof.</P>
      <P>The GIO said the Republic of China firmly supports the efforts of
UNICEF to put an end to the sex trade and the confinement and abuse
of children. The ROC is improving its existing laws, which already
embody many of the U.N. goals, to bring them fully into harmony with
international standards.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) will continue cooperating with other Western countries to
help promote democratization in developing countries, a party
official said in Manila Friday.</P>
      <P>Tien Hsin, director of the DPP's international affairs
department, made the remarks while speaking at an international
conference on the democratization of Myanmar.</P>
      <P>He said that Taiwan has drawn international attention with two
achievements -- economic development and democratization.</P>
      <P>The DPP official noted that Taiwan has in the past used its
economic power to expand its external influence, but has not yet used
its achievement in democratization as a tool.</P>
      <P>He said that the island's example will be helpful to countries
that have encountered difficulties in the development of democracy.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan has completed democratization in only 15 years, Tien
said that its experience will be significant and valuable for other
developing countries.</P>
      <P>He said that the DPP will cooperate with the National Democratic
Institute of the United States next month to raise Taiwan's
international profile within the context of democratization.</P>
      <P>The Manila meeting, with "the dawning of democracy" as its theme,
was designed to promote democratization in Myanmar. It was jointly

    <HEADLINE>CHIEF JUDGE OF PEACE AWARD SPEAKS OUT IN DEFENSE OF CO-ORGANIZER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  14  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The chief judge of an organization that
recently awarded Republic of China Vice President Annette Lu a peace
prize defended Friday the integrity of the World Peace Corps Mission
(WPCM) after a local magazine accused one of its co-founders of being
a con man.</P>
      <P>Lester Wolff, former U.S. congressman and chief judge of the
WPCM, made the remarks after Next magazine reported that Han Min Su,
the South Korean organizer of the WPCM, which awarded the World Peace
Prize to Lu in Taipei last Sunday, had tried to bilk money from the
island kingdom of Tonga.</P>
      <P>Wolff condemned the magazine's report that said Han had offered
the King of Tonga, Taufa'ahau Tupou IV, the peace prize in 1996 and
in exchange for Tonga building a plant Han touted as being able to
convert sea water into natural gas.</P>
      <P>The entire incident had been blown out of proportion in the
Tongan media at the time, Wolff said, adding that he had
documentation to prove his statements -- a signed apology by the
prime minister of Tonga to the WPCM for any misunderstanding.</P>
      <P>Wolff said that it is ridiculous for Next magazine to publish
such an unfounded report.</P>
      <P>Lu's office said Thursday that it would look into the magazine
report about the alleged bungled business deal, but it said that
Han's private business had nothing to do with the peace organization
which was established in 1989.</P>
      <P>Wolff also said that the organization is run independently and
does not receive subsidies from any governments, including Taiwan. He
also said that Han has kept the operation of the organization
low-profile, and has not hyped it as is the case with the Nobel
prizes.</P>
      <P>Wolff said he met with Lu several times and admired her for her
long-term efforts in promoting women's and human rights, and peace,
saying that Lu is "well deserving of the award."</P>
      <P>The former U.S. congressman also said that there are three kinds
of awards bestowed by the organization, and only four political
leaders have received the top awards -- former U.S. President Ronald
Reagan, former Israel Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak, and Lu. The ones bestowed on Cambodia Primer
Minister Hun Sen and Tonga King Taufa'ahau Tupou IV are from a
different category, and the media in Taiwan has confused the two.</P>
      <P>Regarding giving an award to former South Korean President
Syngman Rhee who has been dead for over 30 years, Wolff said that it
is fairly common to award someone posthumously for his contributions
during their lifetime. He also defended giving the award to such a
controversial figure as Hun Sen, saying that the prize also aims to
encourage people to make changes.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The two production lines of the Formosa
Group's high-density polyethylene (HDPE) plant in Linyuan, Kaohsiung
County, were halted by fires Friday.</P>
      <P>An official with the Formosa Group, the largest producer of HDPE
in Taiwan, said that the accident will not affect market supply.</P>
      <P>He said that the Linyuan plant produces 180,000 tons of HDPE
annually, while the group's other plant in Yunlin County is capable
of producing 200,000 tons per year.</P>
      <P>Polyethylene is used in the manufacture of various kinds of
plastics.</P>
      <P>A petrochemical company in Kaohsiung also produces HDPE, the
official added.</P>
      <P>Preliminary investigations have found that the fires were caused
by explosions of a chemical gas leaked from the loosened part of a
connecting ring on the production line.</P>
      <P>Ten fire engines and about 100 firefighters were mobilized to
fight the fires which were extinguished after about two-and-a-half
hours. Two workers suffered from burns and were rushed to hospital
for treatment.</P>
      <P>Officials from the Kaohsiung County Government and the Council
for Labor Affairs visited the scene after the fires. They ordered a
halt to the production lines for safety considerations.</P>
      <P>Company officials said that one of the damaged production lines

    <HEADLINE>GRAND  JUSTICES  RULE ON SEARCHES WITHOUT WARRANTS BY POLICE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  14  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Police searches without warrants are not
unconstitutional, but such searches must be conducted only under
special circumstances and with proper justification, the Council of
Grand Justices ruled Friday.</P>
      <P>In an interpretation of a provision of the Police Operation
Statute, the Grand Justices said the statute, which provides for the
right for searches without warrants, does not empower police to carry
out inspections whenever, wherever and on whomever they choose.</P>
      <P>Rather, the Grand Justices said, such searches should be limited
to places, vehicles or public sites where the risk to public safety
has been clearly established or where such searches would be needed
to achieve a specific objective to mitigate such risks.</P>
      <P>Noting that body searches and investigations into residents and
places of business have been considered routine by police, the Grand
Justices said that such measures can easily be construed to be a
serious infringement on the freedom of movement, privacy and right to
property of individuals. The Grand Justices added that the legal
requirements and procedures for making police searches without
warrants which are absent in the existing law should be written down
clearly and in detail.</P>
      <P>Police should identify themselves by showing proper documents
before performing such searches and inform citizens of the reasons
for the searches.</P>
      <P>When challenged, police may overrule the objections of the
citizens and carry out the search if their commander at the site
determines that there are sufficient grounds for the search, and must
give documentation that acknowledges the details of the search to
citizens who protest.</P>
      <P>The documentation may serve as the basis of any ensuing legal
actions, the Grand Justices said.</P>
      <P>The Grand Justices also concluded that police should follow their
ruling regarding searches without warrants immediately, and revise
the Police Operation Statue within two years.</P>
      <P>In a news conference called to make public the ruling, Judicial
Yuan Secretary-General Yang Jen-shou said from now on, the public can
refuse any police inspection not in line with the Grand Justices'
ruling, and police who perform such inspections are risking
infringing the personal freedom of the citizens of the nation.</P>
      <P>Under this ruling, Yang said police will no longer be able to
raid such establishments as restaurants and love hotels as they often
do currently unless there is reasonable suspicion that the
establishment in question is in fact engaging in illegal activities.</P>
      <P>The days when police can scrutinize these places at random are
gone, Yang said.</P>
      <P>However, Friday's ruling will not stop the police practice of
setting up road blocks to prevent teenagers racing on their
motorcycles as this situation presents a clear risk to the public and
meets the requirement of a clear objective in conducting searches,
Yang said.</P>
      <P>However, even this practice is not to be done beyond what is
reasonable or to the detriment of the ordinary life of the general
public, Yang said.</P>
      <P>Although the Grand Justices' ruling has drawn praise from human
rights activists, police have lambasted their interpretation.</P>
      <P>Lin Hsin-ho, a director of the Chinese Association For Human
Rights lauded the ruling as a small step toward better protection of
human rights, but said that there is much yet to be done.</P>
      <P>He criticized police searches as a serious infringement of
personal freedom and said that the practice should be done away with
completely.</P>
      <P>Lin also said that the two-year grace period to conform the
Police Operation Statute to the ruling of the Grand Justices is too
long. One year ought to be enough, he said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, rank-and-file police reacted angrily to the ruling,
saying it will deteriorate the already frayed social order and peace.</P>
      <P>Police protect the general public by inspecting areas known to be
frequented by criminals, they say, and checking people in these areas
is one good way to keep a check on their activities. Limiting the
rights of the police to make searches will please potential
law-breakers, but hurt the law-abiding public, some police said
privately.</P>

      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung said Friday that
he is "100 percent sure" that the economy will rebound next year.</P>
      <P>Fielding questions in the legislature, the premier also said that
economic growth is expected to reach 2.7 percent, and the jobless

presented by the Council for Economic Planning and Development.</P>
      <P>Chang was responding to legislator Lee Chia-chin of the
opposition Kuomintang, who asked the premier to show the
determination to reinvigorate the economy so that the stock market
could rebound to the 7,000-point level. The market closed at 5,486.73
Friday.</P>
      <P>The premier said that he is quite confident about an economic
rebound, but he will have to "respect market mechanisms" regarding
the stock market.</P>
      <P>Lee said that the Executive Yuan has always adjusted the economic
growth downward, saying that he found the figure of 2.7 percent
economic growth quite "incredible."</P>
      <P>The premier said that economic difficulties have been the result
of the world economic downturn and the entrenched ills of domestic
grass-roots financial institutions. Looking to the future of the
economy, he said he was confident that the situation will improve

      <P>A high-ranking delegation of ROC
officials called on influential members of Congress Thursday and
received pledges of continued support and friendship.</P>
      <P>House Republican Whip Rep. Tom Delay (R-TX) told the delegation
led by Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan Chiou I-jen that he
will continue to support Taiwan's efforts to participate in the World
Health Organization and other world bodies.</P>
      <P>Tipped to become the next House Republican leader, Delay has been
a staunch supporter of Taiwan on Capitol Hill and played a crucial
role in winning better treatment for President Chen Shui-bian during
his transit in New York and Houston last summer.</P>

Washington Tuesday to brief U.S. members of Congress, think tank
experts and administration officials on Taiwan's latest developments
following the Dec. 1 Legislative Yuan and county and municipal

Senate Energy Committee.</P>
      <P>In a statement released to the media, Hyde called the latest
election in Taiwan "the completion of a democratic revolution which
began with the presidential elections of 1996 and 2000."</P>
      <P>"Taiwan has now seen a peaceful transfer of both executive and
legislative power," he said, adding that the island "remains the
model for democracy with Chinese characteristics and a beacon of hope
for freedom- loving people throughout the Chinese world."</P>
      <P>During the three-day visit, Chiou and his delegation also held
discussions with officials representing the White House National
Security Council, the State Department and the Defense Department

    <HEADLINE>ROC HOPING TO ADOPT FRENCH PRESIDENTIAL SYSTEM: ROC OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Dec.  14 (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung and Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A visiting Republic of China official
said Friday that the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) might
consider amending the ROC Constitution and adopt a presidential
system similar to that used in France.</P>
      <P>Cabinet Secretary-General Chiou I-jen said in a meeting with 20
U.S. think tank scholars that the existing "dual leadership" system
where the head of state is the president and the head of government
is the premier causes confusion over constitutional authority.</P>
      <P>However, Chiou went on, constitutional reform to resolve the
problem is unlikely in the short term. The government will instead
first focus on streamlining the existing 36 ministries and government
agencies and adjusting the relationship between the central
government and local governments, he added.</P>
      <P>The DPP administration has announced that it hopes to complete
the first stage of government reform next year by ratifying the
necessary amendments to slim down the Executive Yuan by a third.</P>
      <P>Chiou said that his recent remarks on the DPP administration's
plans to promote a three-branch system of government merely touched
on one aspect of reform that the government hopes to undertake. He
told reporters Wednesday at the National Press Club in Washington
that the DPP has always wanted to adopt a constitutional system
similar to the three-branch system used in the United States, instead
of the five-branch system currently in place.</P>
      <P>The ROC Constitution, promulgated in 1947, installed a complex
system of checks and balances between the five branches of government
-- the Executive Yuan, the Legislative Yuan, the Judicial Yuan, the
Examination Yuan and the Control Yuan -- with a president serving as
the head of state.</P>
      <P>Chiou added that the government will also focus on cutting down
on the number of legislative seats and introducing a single-seat
district system whereby each person would cast two votes -- one for a
legislative candidate, another for a party.</P>
      <P>The current system has voters in one constituency return several
representatives to the Legislative Yuan, making the system
susceptible to factionalism because it increases the competition
among candidates of one party and lowers the number of votes needed
to win a seat. The system encourages candidates to attract the
support of a narrow sector instead of appealing to general
middle-of-the-roaders, because of the low threshold needed to be
elected.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the results of the recent Dec. 1 legislative
elections, Chiou said that the DPP did not achieve its election
victory because of better election strategies but rather because the
people were voting for stability and reform.</P>
      <P>Chiou is on a three-day visit to brief U.S. scholars and
politicians on Taiwan's political situation and policy direction in
the wake of the recent elections which gave the DPP a legislative
majority for the first time.</P>
      <P>His delegation also includes Mainland Affairs Council Chairwoman
Tsai Ing-wen, Presidential Office Deputy Secretary-General Eugene
Chien and Wu An-chia, an official with the Coordination Council for
North American Affairs under the ROC Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</P>
      <P>Chiou is scheduled to depart for Taipei Saturday, while Tsai will
depart the following day.</P>

(By Jay Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A high-ranking delegation of ROC
officials visited influential members of Congress Thursday and
received pledges of continued support and friendship.</P>
      <P>Rep. Tom Delay (R-TX), the House Republican whip, told the
delegation, led by Executive Yuan Secretary-General Chiou I-jen that
he will continue to support Taiwan's efforts to participate in the
World Health Organization and other international bodies.</P>
      <P>Tipped to become the next House Republican leader, Delay has been
a staunch supporter of Taiwan on Capitol Hill and played a crucial
role in winning better treatment for President Chen Shui-bian during
his transit stops in New York and Houston last summer.</P>
      <P>Chiou is head of the four-member delegation that arrived in
Washington on Tuesday for a three-day visit to brief U.S. members of
Congress, think tank experts and administration officials on Taiwan's
latest developments following the Dec. 1 Legislative Yuan and city
and county chief elections.</P>
      <P>The rest of the delegation consists of Tsai Ing-wen, head of the
Mainland Affairs Council, Eugene Chien, deputy secretary-general of
the Presidential Office and Wu An-jia, member of the Foreign
Ministry's Coordination Council for North American Affairs.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, the delegation had a closed-door discussion
with Henry Hyde (R-IL), chairman of the House International Relations
Committee. They also called on Jeff Bingaman (D-NM), chairman of the
Senate Energy Committee.</P>
      <P>In a statement released to the press, Hyde described the recent
elections as "the completion of a democratic revolution that began
with the presidential elections of 1996 and 2000."</P>
      <P>"Taiwan has now seen a peaceful transfer of both executive and
legislative power," he said, adding that the island "remains the
model for democracy with Chinese characteristics and a beacon of hope
for freedom-loving people throughout the Chinese world."</P>
      <P>The delegation also held discussions with officials representing
the White House National Security Council, the State Department and
the Defense Department, although neither side would comment on the
meetings.</P>
      <P>Later Thursday, the delegation met with several former U.S.
officials, including Walter Slocombe and Stanley Roth, both of whom
held senior positions during the Clinton administration.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER OPPOSED TO RASH BARRING OFFICIALS FROM MEDIA OPERATIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  Dec. 15 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung said Saturday
that the government's decision to bar partisan, government and
military influences from domestic media, particularly TV, should not
be implemented rashly.</P>
      <P>Amid rising calls for such influences to be pulled out of
Taiwan's mass media circles, Chang said such moves would result in
"commercialization and profiteering" of the media if acted upon too
hastily.</P>
      <P>Chang said the Executive Yuan had already instructed the
Government Information Office, the Ministry of Education and other
related government agencies to work out measures to implement the
policy, which he was keen to stress is a long-term goal with no set
timetable.</P>
      <P>Chang added that the most important consideration at the moment
is to inject the media with more professionals with practical
experience in the media industry and to then gradually begin phasing
out political influences.</P>
      <P>Also Saturday, Hu Chung-hsin, host of a television talk show and
author of "Son of Taiwan" -- a biography of President Chen Shui-bian
-- urged Chen to personally make sure that political, governmental
and military influence in the media is ended once and for all.</P>
      <P>Hu said Chen had promised to do this during his presidential
election campaign and that it is time for him to deliver on his
promise.</P>
      <P>Hu also called for independent legislator-elect Sisy Chen to quit
her job as presenter of a political talk show on a local cable
channel, to avoid "straddling two boats -- politics and the media."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chang Hsien-yao, director of the Policy Coordination
Center of the opposition People First Party (PFP), said the PFP is
working to establish a supra-party Rainbow Alliance aimed at helping
the president eradicate political, governmental and military
influence from the media.</P>
      <P>Chang also said that Trong Chai, a legislator of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party, should quit his post as chairman of the
Taiwan National Broadcasting Company television station before

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN DOES NOT NEED TO ADOPT FRENCH PRESIDENTIAL SYSTEM: SCHOLAR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  15  (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government has no need to adopt a
presidential system similar to that used in France, a scholar said
Saturday in response to a government official's remarks on possible
reforms.</P>
      <P>Soochow University political science professor Sheng Chih-jen
said that although the similarities between the Republic of China's
and France's constitutional systems would make the scope of such
amendments relatively small, there is no urgency to resolve the
inherent confusion of the existing "dual leadership" system.</P>
      <P>This, he went on, is because a constitutional precedence has just
been established whereby the president has the authority to form the
Cabinet regardless of whether his or her political party is the
majority party in the legislature.</P>
      <P>Under the ROC Constitution, the head of state is the president,
while the head of government is the premier, who is appointed by the
president. The ruling and opposition parties have been at odds as to
whether an opposition party or coalition with a legislative majority
-- either relative or absolute -- should have the right to form the
Cabinet, or whether that power should remain in the hands of the
president even if his party has a legislative minority.</P>
      <P>Sheng said that President Chen Shui-bian established
constitutional precedence by declaring before the Dec. 1 legislative
elections that regardless of the election results, he would form a
"national stabilization alliance" that would be allowed to recommend
Cabinet members, although he would retain the actual right to form
the Cabinet.</P>
      <P>As the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) emerged from the
elections as the largest party in the Legislative Yuan, Sheng went
on, Chen has in effect secured the precedence that a president has
the right to name the premier and form the Cabinet even if his party
does not have an absolute legislative majority.</P>
      <P>The previous Kuomintang (KMT) administration never had to face a
similar problem because it had always retained a legislative majority
during its time in power.</P>
      <P>Sheng said that although the ROC president cannot preside over
Cabinet meetings like the French president, his constitutional
authority actually far surpasses that of the French president.</P>
      <P>The establishment of the new precedent extends the ROC
president's authority beyond that of a president under a purely
presidential constitutional system like that of the United States,
where the Cabinet is headed directly by a president, Sheng said,
because the ROC president does not have to report to the Legislative
Yuan. Only the premier and his Cabinet have to answer to the
legislators.</P>
      <P>Sheng's remarks were made in response to Cabinet
Secretary-General Chiou I-jen, who is currently on a three-day visit
to Washington to brief U.S. experts and officials on post-election
ROC policies and who said Friday that the DPP might consider adopting
a presidential government system similar to the French system.</P>
      <P>Questioning the appropriateness of adopting such a system in
Taiwan, KMT spokesman Chou Shou-shun said that the DPP should stop
blaming the constitutional system for the current chaos and claimed
that the political instability is a result of the DPP's lack of
respect for the KMT's majority in the outgoing Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Chou said that Taiwan's political situation will not be "100
percent stable" as long as the president is elected by a relative
majority and not an absolute majority.</P>
      <P>Also in Washington, Chiou said Wednesday that the DPP has always
hoped to replace the current five-branch governmental system with a
three-branch system similar to the U.S. system.</P>
      <P>The ROC Constitution, promulgated in 1947, installed a complex
system of checks and balances between five branches of government --
the Executive Yuan, the Legislative Yuan, the Judicial Yuan, the
Examination Yuan and the Control Yuan -- while a president serves as
the head of state.</P>

      <P>In order to recruit more foreign personnel with high-technology

      <P>The vice minister added that the government will also step up

      <P>In this respect, he noted that in the next six years, some NT$280
billion (US$8 billion) will be used to improve the island's water
supplies, while relevant measures are being taken to encourage the

the nation's power resources.</P>

      <P>Former Premier Vincent Siew said in
Kaohsiung Saturday that he is optimistic about the economic
developments of mainland China and Taiwan after they join the World
Trade Organization (WTO).</P>
      <P>Becoming a member of the global trade regulatory body is a
challenge, but it also provides opportunities, Siew said in a speech
at a symposium held at National Sun Yat-sen University.</P>
      <P>For mainland China especially, WTO membership will be a "severe
test," said Siew.</P>
      <P>"If the mainland fails to pass the test in three to five years,
social problems and other troubles may arise," he went on. However,
he added, "if it passes the test, the mainland will be reborn."</P>
      <P>In Taiwan's case, Siew continued, WTO membership will mean more
liberalization and globalization of the island's economic
development.</P>
      <P>He predicted that the global economic map will be changed
following WTO entry for the mainland and Taiwan. The mainland became
a full member recently, while Taiwan's membership will become
effective Jan. 1.</P>
      <P>Analyzing the possible impact on Taiwan, Siew said that WTO
membership will deal a blow to the island's agriculture sector, with
unemployment among agricultural workers likely to rise to
100,000.</P>
      <P>Taiwan will have to improve the management of its agricultural
sector and will have to try to have the island recognized as a "free

    <HEADLINE>SURVEY SHOWS TEENAGER MISERY ON THE INCREASE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  16  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's teenagers generally feel more
miserable than a year ago according to a survey released Sunday.</P>
      <P>The 2001 Teenager Misery Index, compiled by the non-profit
Shiang-yang (Facing the Sun) Foundation, found that the greatest
source of teenagers' sufferings is "the grim future for the nation."</P>
      <P>It signifies the teenagers' worry about the future of the
country, said the authors of the survey.</P>
      <P>Other concerns, in order, were "lawmakers' ignorance of the
people's welfare," "inappropriate behavior of politicians,"
"ineffective protection provided by law to law-abiding people" and
"the ever-changing education policy."</P>
      <P>To the surprise of the survey's authors, the top-10 concerns
chosen by teenagers from a list of 34 possible causes of misery were
politics and society.</P>
      <P>In contrast to widely held belief, teenagers feel relative
comfort with their families, ties with the opposite sex, leisure
activities and the environment.</P>
      <P>Worry about poor academic performance and not having friends of
the opposite sex, the two issues that worry their parents most, are
no longer a cause of concern among those interviewed, the survey
said.</P>
      <P>Compared with a similar survey conducted one year ago, the
foundation said the "vision for the nation" showed the greatest drop
in confidence, which signals a deepening worry among teenagers about
the country's future.</P>
      <P>The second sharp drop in confidnece was found in "social
disorders," which reflects their increasing concerns over the
disturbances surrounding them.</P>
      <P>"How do you view the future?" showed the third-sharpest drop,
which indicates teenagers are more pessimistic about their futures
than one year ago, according to the survey.</P>
      <P>Although "treatments from parent" is at the bottom of the misery
list, it shows the parents-children conflict remains a serious issue,
the foundation said.</P>
      <P>The survey was carried out among students of junior and senior
and vocational high schools between September and December.
Altogether, 3,114 valid questionnaires were received.</P>
      <P>The Shiang-yang Foundation is a non-profit organization set up
last October to assist dropouts from senior and junior high schools.</P>

      <P>Before seeking a different position, Liao said, he must consider
whether the job would be maximizing his usefulness to the people.</P>
      <P>Liao pointed out that the government and the people should join
forces to improve the economy and society since the December

renewed mandate.</P>

stagnant economy with actions, not with slogans.</P>

    <HEADLINE>RESUMPTION OF CROSS-STRAIT TALKS RELIES ON MAINLAND CHINA: OFFICIALS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 16 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China holds the key to restarting
cross-strait dialogue, ranking officials with the Mainland Affairs
Council (MAC) said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Despite repeated displays of goodwill by ranking Republic of
China government officials toward mainland China, including President
Chen Shui-bian after Taiwan's general elections on Dec. 1, Beijing
has not responded in kind, said the MAC officials.</P>
      <P>President Chen has said Taiwan and mainland China should first
put aside their disputes to engage in economic and cultural
integration. Stressing that Taiwan will continue improving bilateral
ties, he also said that the "one China" principle is negotiable and
urged leaders in Taipei and Beijing to use their creativity and
wisdom to iron out a definition for the "one China" principle
acceptable to both sides.</P>
      <P>President Chen had also pointed out in his inaugural address in
May 2000 that he would not promote the insertion of the "two-states"
model as stated by former President Lee Teng-hui into the
Constitution, as long as Beijing is willing to renounce the use of
force against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The "two-states" model was put forward by Lee in July 1999 and
resulted in the cessation of institutional negotiations between the
Taipei-based Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) and its mainland
Chinese counterpart -- the Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Strait (ARATS), which marked its 10th anniversary on Sunday.</P>
      <P>The SEF and ARATS were intermediary bodies set up by Taipei and
Beijing to deal with two-way exchanges in the absence of official
contacts between the two sides.</P>
      <P>MAC Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen, Taiwan's top mainland China
policy-maker, recently called on Beijing leaders to accept President
Chen's goodwill to create the feasibility of rekindling bilateral
negotiations.</P>
      <P>MAC Vice Chairman Lin Chong-pin has also said publicly that it
is possible for Taiwan and the mainland to resume dialogue this
coming spring and that the two sides should grab the opportunity.</P>
      <P>Despite Taiwan's efforts, the MAC officials said, decades-old
historical and political problems between the two sides cannot be
resolved by one-sided goodwill alone. Worse still, problems related
to cross-strait ties became major election issues again in the
recently concluded polls, further complicating bilateral relations,
they noted.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan has fully displayed its willingness to resume dialogue
with the mainland, the MAC officials called on Beijing to respond
favorably and reopen bilateral talks with Taipei as soon as possible
to help protect the interests of the people on both sides of the
strait.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT WILL NOT BLOCK GOVERNMENT'S BUDGET: KMT LAWMAKER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  16 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Kuomintang (KMT) lawmakers will not block
the government's 2002 budget and would rather let the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) bear the responsibility for it,
KMT whip at the Legislative Yuan Lee Cheng-tsung said Sunday.</P>
      <P>On the eve of a meeting of KMT lawmakers over the government's
budget, Lee said the KMT does not intend to block the budget, and has
not specific plan to cut any government agency's budget; rather, it
will let the budget pass as intact as possible and let the DPP take
the full political responsibility for it.</P>
      <P>Party lawmakers will cooperate on the 2002 budget and, in
general, the party will follow the schedule worked out by the
opposition and ruling parties.</P>
      <P>Given that the DPP has emerged as the largest party at the
legislature after the Dec. 1 general elections, there is a common
sense within the KMT that the party should stay out of the DPP's way
to avoid being blamed for its failure.</P>
      <P>Although some KMT lawmakers threatened to cut the budget of the
Ministry of Justice in retaliation for what they called its
discrimination against KMT candidates in its crackdown on vote-buying
during the general elections, the party will not fault the ministry
or slash its budget as long as it can account for its act before the
election, Lee said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GOV'T TO PROMOTE CROSS-STRAIT TRADE COOPERATION: MAC CHAIRWOMAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  16  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government will continue to promote
trade and economic cooperation between the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait, Tsai Ing-wen, the nation's top planner on mainland China
policy, said in a speech Saturday in the United States.</P>
      <P>The chairwoman of the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) made the
remarks Saturday on the West Coast of the United States to overseas
Chinese. The MAC released the content of her speech Sunday.</P>
      <P>She said that the government's mainland policy is to uphold the
nation's security and dignity as its top priority and will continue
to promote peace and stability in cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>She also said that both sides should create favorable conditions
for solving political disputes and that to revive normal dialogue,
the government will also continue to take the initiative to create
opportunities for contacts.</P>
      <P>Tsai said differences between the mainland and Taiwan have been
deeply rooted over time. She dismissed the ideas proffered by some
politicians that cross-strait relations have soured since the
pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) took the helm of
the nation.</P>
      <P>On the nation's mainland policy, Tsai said that President Chen
Shui-bian has sought to seek to forge a national consensus since he
took office, pointing to the convening of a cross-party task force
last year and an economic development advisory conference this year
-- both of which have contributed to forging national agreement.</P>
      <P>Tsai also said that the president openly declared that Taiwan's
mainland policy would remain unchanged after the legislative
elections. She continued: "We would also like to see a positive
response from mainland China by hearing it say that its policy toward
Taiwan will remain unchanged" so that cross-strait relations will not
be changed by the results of parliamentary elections in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The DPP became the largest party after collecting 87 seats in the
225-seat legislature. The Kuomintang lost its grip on the legislature
after garnering only 68 seats.</P>
      <P>On preconditions set by the mainland on reopening cross-strait
dialogue, Tsai said that both sides will have to face political
reality in the end, but as there is no current environment or
conditions for both sides to solve political disputes, "We believe
that both sides should actively create an atmosphere favorable to
solve the problems." She said this atmosphere will be created through
the building of mutual trust, goodwill, cooperation and dialogue.</P>
      <P>She said that the continued trade, economic, and social exchanges
will form the basis of nurturing such mutual trust.</P>
      <P>Tsai said that cross-strait issues are highly complicated and
that because of its complicity, though the international community is
always concerned with the cross-strait situation, it could hardly
comprehend the core of the issue.</P>
      <P>Tsai said that as Beijing tries to raise cross-strait issues in
the international community and has deterred other countries from
becoming involved in the issue, "We are obliged to help others to
correctly and deeply understand the nature and development of
cross-strait relations, so that the international community can help
protect the peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait and
the entire Asia-Pacific region.

FIGHT OVER SENUIO CITIZENS' ALLOWANCE TO BE STAGED AT LEGISLATURE</P>
      <P>Taipei, Dec. 16 (CNA) A NT$16 billion (US$463.76 million)
budget for special allowances for senior citizens is likely to
draw the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and the
opposition into an acrimonious debate in the Legislative Yuan
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The DPP has vowed to push through the quasi-pension budget
proposal, while the largest opposition party Kuomintang (KMT) insists
that any government financial assistance be legislated first.</P>
      <P>Lee Cheng-chong, KMT whip in the Legislative Yuan, said Sunday a
"legal basis" is necessary for every government outlay. "The KMT," he
added, "will consult other (opposition) parties on how to address the
issue."</P>
      <P>His People First Party counterpart, Chou Hsi-wei, said such
consultations are necessary. He added his party could not tolerate a
squeeze in the social welfare budget by the allowances for the aged.</P>
      <P>A bill for the allowances, promised by President Chen Shui-bian
during his 2000 presidential campaign, was rejected by the KMT-led
opposition at the legislature earlier this year. The opposition
claimed the bill was ill-thought, criticizing it as a policy designed
to solicit votes for the ruling party in the Dec. 1 legislative
elections.</P>
      <P>In order to make good on President Chen's campaign promise,
the Executive Yuan had the budget for the allowances included in the
planned expenditures of the Ministry of the Interior (MOI) for 2002,
pledging to implement it by decree, if necessary.</P>
      <P>The stage is all set for the mid-week clash on the floor in the
Legislative Yuan, where the DPP, riding on its stunning victory in
the elections, is ready to railroad the MOI budget. The opposition,
however, still holds the legislative majority.</P>
      <P>Whether the allowances -- NT$3,000 a month to each of an
estimated 400,000 people over 65 years of age -- will be issued
depends in large part on how well the opposition can coordinate
efforts to block the MOI budget request.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP CHAIRMAN OPTIMISTIC ABOUT TAIWAN'S POLITICAL REFORM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Los  Angeles,  Oct.  15  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Frank Hsieh, chairman of Taiwan's
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), said here Saturday that he
is optimistic about Taiwan's political reform.</P>
      <P>Addressing some 1,000 overseas Taiwanese living in the greater
Los Angeles area at a dinner party, Hsieh emphasized the
stability in Taiwan's political situation and pointed out that the
ruling party will be able to make good on its reform promises.</P>
      <P>After the legislative elections on Dec. 1, Hsieh said, the people
have regained confidence in the DPP government, to which they
attributed the political stability Taiwan needs most to weather the
current economic woes.
 "All indications are that things are going well," Hsieh
pointed out, "and I believe we will be able to carry on our political
reform in stability."</P>
      <P>One indication is a recovery in the stock market in the wake of
the elections, Hsieh said. All fundamentals of the economy have
since shown improvements. Foreign investors are also optimistic about
Taiwan's economic future.</P>
      <P>In particular, Hsieh said, the DPP victory in the legislative
elections has strengthened President Chen Shui-bian's hands in
implementing his promised reform. The DPP became the largest party
in the Legislative Yuan by winning 87 seats in the 225-member
legislature.</P>
      <P>Hsieh explained the government plan to reform Taiwan's financial,
legislative and administrative systems in his speech, titled "The
Post-election Development of Taiwan's Political Situation."</P>
      <P>He said the best way to eliminate corruption and reduce waste of
financial resources is to privatize government-run enterprises.
Other reforms include the downsizing of the legislature and a
streamlined administration.</P>
      <P>Turning to Taiwan's relations with mainland China, Hsieh said he
is "quite optimistic" about the ties across the Taiwan Strait. However,
he said Beijing leaders' failure to understand Taiwan's democratic
system and its "mainstream of public opinion" remains the biggest
obstacle to improved cross-strait relations. He referred to the DPP
election success that signals the rejection by the electorate of
Beijing's "one country, two systems" approach to the solution of the
problem of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Beijing's oft-repeated formula for China's reunification is
totally unacceptable to the people of Taiwan, Hsieh said. The
People's Republic of China applied that formula in 1997 to Hong Kong,
relegating the former British crown colony to a special administrative
district, where its chief executive Tung Chee-hwa must take orders from
Beijing.

    <HEADLINE>MAINLAND SON-IN-LAW BECOMES ROC CONSCRIPT AT AGE 37</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 17 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A mainland Chinese man who married a woman
from Taiwan several years ago was conscripted in October into the
Republic of China's armed forces for two years' of compulsory
military service after he obtained ROC citizenship.</P>
      <P>Wang Shaojie, 37, from northeastern China, reported to the
Chengkungling New Recruit Training Center located in central Taiwan
two months ago to begin his military service in Taiwan, making him
the first mainland Chinese citizen to do so after the ROC government
in February of this year amended the statutes governing people's
relations across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Wang, who ran his own small restaurant in the northeastern
Chinese city of Shenyang before coming to Taiwan to become a
"Taiwanese son-in-law," has reportedly received better treatment than
the average conscript due to the fact that he is almost twice as old
as most new recruits.</P>
      <P>He could have avoided having to do his military service if the
ROC government had not amended the cross-strait statutes in February
raising the maximum conscription age for ROC citizens from 35 years
old to 40 years old.</P>
      <P>Wang was granted ROC citizenship in December of last year after
he had applied for permanent resident's status in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Wang's wife, a young woman from Yuanlin, central Taiwan, went to
Shenyang several years ago to open a wedding gown salon and met Wang
there.</P>
      <P>The couple, who have two children, now run a hot pot restaurant
in Yuanlin with the help of Wang's Taiwanese in-laws.</P>
      <P>Just one week after reporting to the Chengkungling base, Wang
checked into a military hospital for high blood pressure, an illness
which he had never had before. His in-laws then sought the help of a
legislator in an attempt to allow Chang to carry out his military
service in a non-military capacity.</P>
      <P>Chang now works from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. at the Yuanlin Township
Administration Office as an alternative conscript.</P>
      <P>He seems comfortable with his current life in Taiwan -- carrying
out his two-year military service during the day while minding his
restaurant and spending quality time with his Taiwan family in the
evening.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 17 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China liaison offices overseas
will begin receiving applications Dec. 20 by mainland Chinese
citizens for tourist visits to Taiwan, the Bureau of Immigration
reported Monday.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan passed a bill in late November formally
allowing mainland Chinese tourists to come to Taiwan for leisure
trips beginning Jan. 2, 2002.</P>
      <P>Under the initiative, Taiwan will allow on a trial basis a
limited number of mainland Chinese citizens to travel from any spot
outside the Chinese mainland to Taiwan for tourist visits.</P>
      <P>According to Tseng Wen-chang, commissioner of the Bureau of
Immigration, the plan will allow a maximum of 1,000 mainland Chinese
citizens to visit Taiwan each day for tourism purposes, with the
period of stay per trip being no longer than 10 days.</P>
      <P>Initially, according to Tseng, only mainland Chinese citizens who
are studying abroad or are permanent residents of a foreign country
will be allowed to apply for tourist visits.</P>
      <P>Under the pilot plan, Taiwan-based travel agencies sponsoring
mainland Chinese tourists to Taiwan will have to deposit an NT$1
million cash guarantee to the government before handling any such
business to make sure that they will be able to take responsibility
in the event of any irregularities, including tourists absconding or
overstaying their visas, as well as any accidents.</P>
      <P>The plan will be further liberalized in the future depending on
how well the initial stage is carried out and on how cross-strait
relations develop, Tseng said.</P>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung announced Oct. 20, 2000 that visitors
from mainland China would be able to take leisure trips to Taiwan
beginning July 2001 as part of the ROC government's efforts to
address the cross-strait political impasse.</P>
      <P>The plan, however, was not implemented as scheduled, and it had
remained unclear when it would be put into practice until the
Executive Yuan passed the pilot plan Nov. 23, paving the way for the
actual implementation of the initiative.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 17 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Cancer remained the top killer in Taiwan in
2000, with an average of 86 citizens dying from the disease each day,
the Ministry of the Interior (MOI) reported Monday.</P>
      <P>If deaths due to cancer were excluded, the average lifespan of
Republic of China citizens would be 3.31 years longer, officials from
the MOI Statistics Department said.</P>
      <P>The figures showed that cancer deaths reduced the average
lifespan of an average Taiwan male from 76.45 years to 72.67 years
and reduced the average lifespan of an average Taiwan female from
81.21 years to 78.44 years.</P>
      <P>The top ten killers in Taiwan in 2000 were cancer, strokes, heart
disease, accidents, diabetes, chronic liver disease, kidney disease,
pneumonia, suicide and lung disease, in that order.</P>
      <P>The number of deaths due to cancer, strokes, diabetes, kidney
disease and suicide each rose last year over the 1999 levels, while
the number of deaths caused by accidents, heart disease and pneumonia
each declined, the officials quoted the MOI tallies as indicating.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the year 2000 represented the third straight year that
suicide was among the top 10 causes of death in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The MOI tallies showed that those between 15 years old and 44
years old were mostly likely to commit suicide. MOI officials said
the high suicide rate in 2000 might be related to last year's
domestic economic recession.</P>
      <P>In 2000, a total of 2,471 people in Taiwan committed suicide, or
an average of seven people per day, up 8.33 percent over the average

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  17  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's information industry hardware
production is expected to experience 9.4 percent growth next year
despite negative growth in production value this year, an adviser of
the Institute for Information Industry (III) said Monday.</P>
      <P>Wang Sheng-hung, adviser of the III's Market Intelligence Center
(MIC), said that Taiwan's information industry hardware production
ranked fourth in the world this year, ahead of Great Britain's and
behind the United States', Japan's and mainland China's.</P>
      <P>However, Taiwan is the only country among the top five nations in
information industry hardware production that recorded negative
growth this year, thanks to the global economic slump and especially
the sluggish U.S. economy.</P>
      <P>Wang noted that U.S. consumer confidence suffered a blow in the
wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on America. Noting that the
U.S. market makes up 40 percent of the world's information market,
Wang said Taiwan's hardware industry has been significantly affected,
experiencing negative growth, of 9.2 percent, for the first time ever
this year.</P>
      <P>But with the U.S. military campaign against Afghanistan drawing
to an end and with the expected shopping spree during the Christmas
holidays, Wang predicted that Taiwan's information hardware
production for next year will hit US$46.69 billion for a growth of
9.4 percent, or slightly less than the peak growth rate in 2000.</P>

Confucius' lesson of the day: "Study without thinking is labor
lost. Thinking without study is perilous. To give oneself up to the
study of metaphysical theories -- that is very injurious indeed.
Shall I teach you what is understanding? To know what it is that you
know, and to know what it is that you do not know -- that is
understanding."</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT PRESIDES OVER COMMISSION CEREMONY OF 1ST F-16 FIGHTER WING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  18  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian presided over a
ceremony marking the commissioning of the nation's first F-16 fighter
wing into service held Tuesday at Chiayi Air Base in southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>After viewing 24 F-16 fighters roar overhead in six groups in
combat formation flying at an altitude of 1,000 feet and at a speed
of 300 nautical miles, the president inspected 18 F-16 fighters on
the ground as well as more than 300 military personnel from within a
grand marshal limousine.</P>
      <P>The president also boarded one of the F-16 fighters to learn more
about the war plane, which is equipped with 20-mm cannons, AIM-7M
radar guided missiles, AIM-9M air-to-air missiles, harpoon missiles
and the LANIRTN (low-altitude navigation and infrared targeting for
night) pod.</P>
      <P>The Chiayi Air Base spokesman said the maximum speed of the F-16
is Mach 2, with a maximum thrust of 23,770 pounds, while the search
range of the radar is 80 nautical miles, enabling the fighter to
carry out anti-air, anti-sea and anti-blockade missions.</P>
      <P>President Chen said he was gratified to preside over the
commissioning of the 455th tactical combat aircraft wing, adding that
nine years passed between the initial signing of contracts and the
formal commissioning of the wing, which marks the deployment of a new
generation of fighter jets forming a modernized force that can
maintain air superiority in the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The president also said the air force buildup is for the purpose
of national survival and development, stressing that Taiwan has no
intention of engaging in an arms race with mainland China. The
buildup aims to establish a stable strategic situation in the Taiwan
Strait, he said, pointing out that one must have a sufficient
defensive capability to prevent wars from taking place.</P>
      <P>The Republic of China Air Force purchased 120 single-seat F-16
Fighting Falcons from the United States and 30 of the twin-seat
version to carry out mid-altitude offshore interception missions. The
first batch of the advanced fighters arrived at Chiayi Air Base in
April 1997.</P>
      <P>Reports said the second F-16 fighter wing will be commissioned in
Hualien, eastern Taiwan, in 2002.</P>
      <P>Together with the 60 Mirage 2000-5s fighter jets that the ROC
purchased from France and the 130 locally-built indigenous defense
fighters, these advanced fighters form the backbone of the island's
modernized air force.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOEA WORKING ON SUPERVISORY MECHANISM FOR SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  18  (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice Minister of Economic Affairs Chen
Ruey-long said Tuesday that his ministry will work out a supervisory
mechanism with related government agencies and the semiconductor
industry to regulate Taiwan semiconductor manufacturers' investments
in mainland China in the future.</P>
      <P>Referring to the yet to be lifted restrictions on the
semiconductor sector's investments in eight-inch wafer foundries in
mainland China, Chen said that he expects the government and the
industry to reach consensus on such a mechanism before the end of
this month.</P>
      <P>Since the government has agreed to adopt a more open policy in
terms of Taiwan businesspeople's investments in mainland China, the
semiconductor sector is calling on the authorities concerned to at
least lift the ban on eight-inch wafer foundry investments across the
Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The government is reluctant to allow the semiconductor sector to
shift their investments to mainland China for fear of weakening
Taiwan's competitiveness. At a meeting last week, the government and
the industry reached consensus that an effective supervisory
mechanism should be established before lifting the ban.</P>
      <P>Regarding the supervisory mechanism, the Taiwan Semiconductor
Industry Association (TSIA) has proposed that the government only
allow investments in foundries of eight-inch wafers or of lower
technological levels. As for related businesses such as IC designing
and packaging, the association feels they should be taken off the
control list.</P>
      <P>In order that Taiwan businesspeople maintain their roots in
Taiwan, the TSIA suggests that government permission to make
investments on the mainland only be given to those engaged in
semiconductor R&amp;D, design, packaging, testing, and manufacturing
equipment and materials. Businesspeople in other sectors should not
be allowed to invest in the semiconductor or IC manufacturing sector
in mainland China, according to the TSIA.</P>
      <P>TSIA Secretary-General Chen Wen-hsien said that the semiconductor
sector also agreed that the corporate net assets of the investors
should be under supervision of the authorities. Also, if an
industrial group makes the investment, only the net assets of the
semiconductor department will be under supervision.</P>
      <P>The domestic electronics industry is keen on exploring mainland
China's rapidly developing market, especially when local authorities
in mainland China are offering attractive incentives.</P>
      <P>Morris Chang, chairman of the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing
Corp. (TSMC), said Monday that for mid- and long-term planning,
Taiwan's semiconductor manufacturers must start their deployments in
mainland China.</P>
      <P>Chang said that the TSMC will carry on its 12-inch wafer foundry
projects in Taiwan, adding that in the meantime, it will gradually
phase out production of eight-inch chips. While the TSMC has no
imminent 12-inch wafer foundry investment projects in mainland China,
any investment plan in mainland China will only involve shifting
existing production facilities there.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan's strategic industry, the IC industry grossed total
revenue amounting to NT$115.4 billion in the third quarter of this
year. In the manufacturing sector, foundries and DRAMs made up around
90 percent of Taiwan's IC manufacturing business, according to
statistics released by the TSIA.</P>

      <P>China Airlines (CAL) announced Tuesday that
it will begin code-sharing services on cross-Pacific routes with the
United States-based Delta Airlines early next year.</P>
      <P>Executives of the two aviation companies signed the cooperation

      <P>CAL said the two sides will discuss issues on cargo, passenger
services and computer reservations in the coming months before
launching joint operations in spring.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the agreement, CAL passengers from Taiwan can
proceed from Los Angeles and San Francisco to Atlanta, Dallas,
Cincinnati, Tampa and Salt Lake City on Delta flights. At the same
time, CAL will also provide code-sharing flight services for Delta
passengers from six U. S. cities, including New York and Atlanta to
Taipei.</P>
      <P>CAL, Taiwan's largest carrier, operates 56 airplanes and flies to
50 cities in 21 countries.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Taipei-based Chinese-language Liberty Times

      <P>According to the report, CAL has confirmed that it is planning to
conduct passenger flight services on the Taipei-New Delhi route next
spring.</P>
      <P>The move represents a fresh breakthrough for CAL in its

with KMT Chairman Lien Chan.</P>
      <P>Lin said that he would convey Chen's intention to Lien who is now

      <P>According to Lin, Chen wants to discuss with the KMT chairman
matters related to legislative reform, governmental reorganization,
economic development and political stabilization.</P>
      <P>Lin told Yu that the KMT will respect the ruling Democratic

    <TEXT>
      <P>"A Woman Soldier's Own Story," the
autobiography of veteran Chinese female author Xie Bingying
(1906-2000), has been translated into English and published recently
by Columbia University Press.</P>
      <P>"In lyrical, flowing prose," the Publishers Weekly said, "this
absorbing autobiography interweaves politics, family relations and
romance as it chronicles an extraordinary woman's struggle to free
herself from traditional Chinese society."</P>
      <P>When translating and compiling the English version of "A Woman
Soldier's Own Story," Xie's daughter, Lily Chia Brissman, and her
American husband Barry Brissman, combined the two autobiographies
that Xie wrote in 1936 and 1946.</P>
      <P>"Her personal struggle to define herself within the larger
context of political change in China early in the last century is a
poignant testament of determination and a striking story of one
woman's journey from old China into the new world," the Library
Journal commented.</P>
      <P>A native of the mainland Chinese province of Henan, Xie fought
during the 1920s and 1930s to free herself from the constraints of
ancient Chinese tradition by fleeing her hometown and joining the
army and at the same time writing.</P>
      <P>Xie moved to Taiwan in 1949 in a cross-strait exodus from
mainland China under the lead of the Republic of China government.</P>
      <P>During her decades of life in Taiwan, she taught Chinese writing

    <TEXT>
      <P>Due to the delicate situation across the
Taiwan Strait, mainland China may continue boycotting Taiwan after
the island enters the World Trade Organization (WTO) Jan. 1, 2002, an
expert warned Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Kao Chang, a senior researcher at the Chunghua Institution for
Economic Research, said the mainland may also pick on Taiwan's name
in the world trade regulatory body and seek to prevent Taiwan from
taking part in multilateral trade negotiations under the WTO
framework, including rejecting two-way talks with Taiwan and blocking
Taiwan's presence in the international community.</P>
      <P>Taiwan applied to join the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
-- the predecessor of the WTO -- in 1990 under the name of "Separate
Customs Territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu."</P>
      <P>In the face of these possibilities, Kao called on the government
to work out countermeasures. He issued the warning in a keynote
speech on the future of cross-strait economic exchanges sponsored by
the Mainland Affairs Council.</P>
      <P>As to the impact of WTO membership on both Taiwan and mainland
China, Kao said Taiwan should be wary of the effects of the influx of
mainland Chinese capital and the opening of the local market to
foreign imports, as well as the mainland's magnetism to Taiwan
businesses and greater competition between the two sides.</P>
      <P>However, he also contended that cross-strait trade and commercial
ties will be further enhanced and that two-way economic integration
will also be boosted.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING CENSORS BOOKS USED BY TAIWANESE SCHOOLS IN MAINLAND CHINA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 18 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Textbooks used by two Taiwanese schools in
mainland China have been censored by Beijing authorities, education
officials in Taiwan said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Parts of the books considered politically incorrect by the
Beijing authorities have either been deleted or forbidden for use in
the schools.</P>
      <P>The political differences between the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait stems from Beijing's refusal to consider the Republic of China
as a state and its abhorrence of any idea that boosts Taiwan's
political identity.</P>
      <P>As a result, the name of any organization or agency whose title
contains the words "national," "central" or any other word suggesting
ROC sovereignty has been deleted from the books.</P>
      <P>The Beijing authorities even took offense at the name of Taiwan's
National Institute for Compilation, whose title appears routinely at
the end of government-approved test books, and ordered the back cover
to be torn off.</P>
      <P>The ROC flag is also considered taboo and cannot appear in any
textbooks used by Taiwanese schools set up in the mainland.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's description of the civil war between the Chinese
communists and the nationalist and the ROC's 1949 relocation to
Taiwan after losing the civil war is also offensive to the Beijing
authorities, who have ordered it revised to the effect that the ROC
was replaced by the People's Republic of China in 1949, implying that
the ROC ceased to exist as a state from that time on.</P>
      <P>And introductory courses on Taiwan's geography, history and
society in elementary schools and junior high schools are forbidden,
as Beijing sees them as encouraging Taiwan independence.</P>
      <P>The students have to use the atlas published by the Beijing
authorities during their courses in geography.</P>
      <P>The two -- one in Dongguan, Guangdong Province, the other in
Kunshan, near Shanghai City -- have appealed against Beijing's
decision, but admitted that they will have no choice but to accept
the censorship if their appeal is rejected.</P>
      <P>Courses forbidden in mainland China will be taught when students
return to Taiwan for summer or winter vacations, according to the
education officials.</P>
      <P>They also said they are weighing the possibility of compiling
textbooks exclusively for Taiwanese schools in mainland China in
order to accommodate Beijing's concerns.</P>

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Central News Agency (CNA) and the
MiTAC-Synnex Group entered into a strategic alliance Tuesday to offer
speedy corporate news and commercial and industrial information
services in Chinese to domestic and global enterprises.</P>
      <P>CNA (http://www.cna.com.tw/) President Bill Wang and MiTAC-Synnex
Group Chairman Matthew Miao inked the agreement on the alliance on
behalf of their respective organizations, witnessed by Vice Minister
of Economic Affairs Chen Ruey-long and Deputy Director-General of the
Government Information Office Lee Cher-jean.</P>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu telegraphed her congratulations on the
CNA-MiTAC partnership.</P>
      <P>Under the agreement, CNA and iPRnews (http://www.iprnews.com.tw)
-- an offshoot of the MiTAC-Synnex Group -- will cooperate in
expanding their information services through the Internet to directly
provide corporate news and financial and stock information.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the ceremony, Chen said the CNA-MiTAC partnership can
serve as a model for cooperation between the mass media and the
information technology industry.</P>
      <P>Using CNA's news network, private enterprises can obtain fast,
complete and comprehensive corporate, financial and stock market
news, Chen said.</P>
      <P>He noted that the Ministry of Economic Affairs acquires much of
its news information via CNA reports.</P>
      <P>With its fast and accurate news reporting, CNA makes a good
partner for business cooperation, Chen added.</P>
      <P>Wang said that CNA, the first Taiwan media organization to
computerize its news reporting system, has always tried to upgrade
its services to its customers.</P>
      <P>This CNA-iPRnews cooperation will definitely further upgrade
CNA's services to its global customers with the aid of Internet
technology and networks that bypass slower and more time-consuming
methods of news transmission, Wang added.</P>
      <P>MiTAC-Synnex Group Chairman and CEO Matthew Miao said the release
of corporate news has a huge impact on investors' rights and
interests. All media and financial/stock markets require open and
instantaneous access to information, he noted.</P>
      <P>Miao continued that from the corporation's point of view,
efficiently and effectively released corporate news will maximize
public relations coverage.</P>
      <P>Miao added that the partnership allows Taiwan's corporations a
better chance to expose themselves globally, which will increase
their competitiveness and enhance their public image.</P>
      <P>To celebrate the inauguration of the CNA-iPRnews cooperation,
iPRnews announced that all clients will enjoy a "free trial" period.
News will be delivered through CNA's news network and can be
"expressly mailed" to the terminals of media wishing to try the
service, iPRnews said.</P>
      <P>iPRnews urged potential clients to take the opportunity to
experience the "best and most effective" news distribution network.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC PRESIDENT MIGHT MEET WITH PFP CHAIRMAN: PFP OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 18 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>People First Party (PFP) Secretary-General
David Chung said Tuesday that he met with President Chen Shui-bian's
chief of staff Yu Shyi-kung Tuesday to discuss the possibility of
talks between the president and PFP Chairman James Soong.</P>
      <P>Chung said the meeting was requested by Yu last week, but added
that no date for a Chen-Soong meeting had yet been set and that
although Soong is willing to meet with the president, there is no
urgency in the matter.</P>
      <P>Chung quoted Yu as saying that Chen telephoned Soong on Dec. 1 to
express his willingness to cooperate with Soong on laying down major
national policies, reforming the Legislative Yuan, streamlining the
government, developing the economy and stabilizing the political
landscape. He also said he would not exclude other issues from the
agenda.</P>
      <P>Chung went on to say that in light of the unwelcome effects of a
secret meeting between the two leaders in July, Yu suggested that any
future meeting between the two should be arranged through their
chiefs of staff.</P>
      <P>When news of the July meeting came to light, Soong was plagued by
rumors that he was colluding secretly with Chen to the detriment of
Soong's political ally -- the opposition Kuomintang, at that time the
leading party at the legislature.</P>
      <P>However, Chung said, Soong did not see any urgency for a meeting
with the president, given that the main opposition parties have
agreed to respect Chen's power to assemble a Cabinet after his party
won the Dec. 1 general elections, while the domestic economy, riding
on a sudden surge in stock prices, has recovered slightly since the
elections.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, Chung added, Soong is busy trying to build consensus
among newly elected PFP legislators on policy issues.</P>

    <HEADLINE>HARVARD MEDICAL PH.D. RETURNS TO CAMPUS AS ENTOMOLOGY FRESHMAN</HEADLINE>

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A local physician who received his
doctorate from Harvard University and who is almost twice as old as
most college freshmen, returned to school this fall as a freshman in
the Department of Entomology of National Taiwan University (NTU).</P>
      <P>47-year-old Chen Chia-chen seemed to be "a fish in his own pond"
when he began attending classes at the entomology department, even
though he was a freshman beginning at the bottom of the academic
ladder.</P>
      <P>"It is almost like a dream come true, as I have wanted to study
insects since I was very young," said Chen recently.</P>
      <P>Chen, who has practiced in Taiwan over the past few years, began
thinking of giving up his practice last year after suffering severe
burns in an explosion in his laboratory. His interest in starting
again in another field was rekindled several months ago while helping
his high-school son with his homework.</P>
      <P>He took the courageous step of preparing for the hard-fought
Joint College Entrance Examination this summer, winning entry to the
prestigious NTU.</P>
      <P>Chen has been a role model for his much-younger peers in his
department over the past two months. He is never late for class,
never leaves early and completes tests as fast as a machine,
according to his classmates.</P>
      <P>Chen takes his entomology studies seriously, saying that he will
finish the four-year university course, continue to seek higher-level
research in this field and hopefully obtain master and doctoral
degrees.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Premier Chang Chun-hsiung
said Tuesday that the government has not yet decided whether to
include the word "Taiwan" on Republic of China passports.</P>
      <P>Replying to a question raised by New Party Legislator Fung
Hu-hsiang, Chang said that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) has
been studying the issue, as travelers have complained that some
foreign countries, especially those in Africa and Europe, have
mistaken them for citizens of the People's Republic of China.</P>
      <P>He noted that the issue is still being studied by MOFA and added
that it will be handled in line with international practice. He also
made clear that the name of the country will not be altered.</P>
      <P>The premier stressed that the inclusion of "Taiwan" on ROC
passports would be designed to help foreign governments distinguish
ROC passports from those of the PRC.</P>
      <P>Some opposition lawmakers said they would oppose the move, which
they described as an attempt by the Democratic Progressive Party
administration to change the name of the country from the ROC to

cited problems with a flight transfer in an unannounced country on
Lu's way to Gambia as the reason for her postponed departure.</P>

      <P>A ministry spokeswoman had announced Lu's itinerary the day
before, saying that the vice president would make a transit stop in a

the communist regime.</P>

(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Executives of Taiwan's almost-bankrupt
state-run China Shipbuilding Corp. (CSBC) urged its employees Tuesday
to "support a company reconstruction plan."</P>
      <P>The CSBC, with capital of NT$11 billion (US$317 million) and some
5,000 employees, has accumulated losses of NT$10.56 billion as of
this month and might be declared bankrupt by the end of the month, a
company official said.</P>
      <P>He added that the reconstruction plan will include layoffs and
salary cuts.</P>
      <P>The CSBC plans to lay off 2,500 employees and cut salaries by 35
percent for the remaining personnel as part of its reconstruction
plan. It has presented the plan to the Commission of National
Corporations (CNC) under the Ministry of Economic Affairs, in the
hope of getting more funding from the government to help the company
survive.</P>
      <P>Unsurprisingly, however, the plan encountered strong opposition
from the employees, who promised to stage protests.</P>
      <P>The official noted that the CSBC had originally asked to borrow
money from other state companies such as Taiwan Sugar Corp. and
Taiwan Salt Industrial Corp., but was rejected by the CNC, which
maintains that it may favor the closure of the shipyard if it does
not try to improve its financial situation and accelerate its
reconstruction plan.</P>
      <P>A CNC official said the Cabinet is expected to appropriate NT$6
billion for the CSBC in January next year if it implements the
reconstruction plan at the end of this month.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ECONOMICS MINISTRY DOESN'T SUPPORT CCP-TAIWAN BUSINESS LINKS: LIN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 19 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China Ministry of Economic
Affairs (MOEA) "does not encourage" mainland China-based Taiwan
enterprises to join the ranks of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP),
Economic Affairs Minister Lin Hsin-yi said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Fielding questions at the Legislative Yuan, Lin admitted that the
alleged incorporation of CCP cells into the Shenzhen-based offshoot
of Taiwan's Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. "is an issue that should
be faced squarely and tackled."</P>
      <P>Lin said the MOEA will keep in close contact with the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs and the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) to gain a
deeper understanding of the alleged CCP "infiltration" into
Taiwan-financed business and industrial operations on the Chinese
mainland.</P>
      <P>Lin made the remarks in response to a question raised by
Legislator Chiu Chui-chen from the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party. Chiu claimed that the CCP is aggressively absorbing mainland
China-based Taiwan business people to organize CCP branch operations
in an attempt to sharpen the CCP's "united front" overture toward
Taiwan and its people.</P>
      <P>Chiu asked Lin whether he knows how many Taiwan companies have
made investments in mainland China, further questioning what the
government would do if all the Taiwan firms operating on the mainland
became "communized" and their staff returned to Taiwan to vote in
major elections.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, Taiwan capital equivalent to US$19.4 billion
has been channeled into mainland China to finance or invest in more
than 20,000 companies, although mainland Chinese authorities put the
figure at around US$45 billion.</P>
      <P>Lin admitted that the alleged CCP involvement in Taiwan companies
on the mainland "is not a good thing." He however pointed out that as
far as he knows, the number of people who work at Taiwan firms on the
mainland and organize CCP operations is "very small," adding that
their political activities are seen as not having a major impact on
the operations of the mainland-based Taiwan companies.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the MAC said that it is probing the alleged CCP
operations in Hon Hai's Shenzhen affiliate Foxconn and that it will
determine whether ROC statutes governing people's relations across
the Taiwan Strait have been violated after it gains a better
understanding of the situation.</P>
      <P>It was learned that Foxconn is an overseas holding company
registered in a third country.</P>
      <P>Foxconn, established in Shenzhen in 1988 with a workforce of
38,000 people, is expected to post an export trade of US$2.4 billion
this year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ECONOMIC GROWTH PREDICTED TO  BE AROUND 3.08 PERCENT NEXT YEAR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 19 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's economic growth this year will be
negative 1.89 percent, down from an earlier prediction of 2.38
percent, but should return to around 3.08 percent next year, an
economic research institute said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Kuan Chung-min, director of the Institute of Economics of
Academia Sinica, the nation's highest research organization, made the
remarks during a press conference on Taiwan's economic outlook for
2002.</P>
      <P>Kuan predicted that the economy will hit the bottom in the fourth
quarter of this year and will achieve positive growth in the first
quarter next year, ending the recession of the past three consecutive
quarters.</P>
      <P>However, he went on, as the unemployment rate and bad loans in
financial institutions are still high, the economic rebound will be
modest. Kuan further predicted economic growth in the four quarters
of next year at 1.04 percent, 2.39 percent, 4.58 percent and 4.16
percent, respectively.</P>
      <P>He cautioned, however, that unemployment will exceed 5 percent --
far more than the figure predicted by the government.</P>
      <P>Kuan noted that Taiwan's economic development has undergone
transformation and that low economic growth, or even no growth, will
be a trend, adding that the most worrisome thing next year will be
unemployment.</P>
      <P>He said that the large number of jobless due to economic
transformation will have a hard time finding news jobs and that
unemployment will increase dramatically to between 5 percent and 6
percent compared to the 2 percent to 3 percent of past years.</P>
      <P>He noted that the Council for Economic Planning and Development
under the Executive Yuan predicted that the agricultural sector will
bear the brunt of the fallout after Taiwan's entry into the World
Trade Organization (WTO) and that 100,000 people in the sector will
be released into the job market over the next five years.</P>
      <P>He said that as these people will be mostly in their 40s or
older, with relatively low education levels, it will be difficult for
them to find new jobs.</P>
      <P>In terms of the service sector, the government will be more open
to foreigners after WTO entry and Kuan predicted that mergers of
local financial institutions will become more fierce, resulting in
middle- or high-ranking officials in local financial institutions
facing pressure of being replaced by their foreign counterparts.</P>
      <P>He said that as white-collar workers are mostly in their 40s or
older and have reached the time of life when they have the heaviest
financial burden regarding family support, their unemployment will be
particularly detrimental.</P>
      <P>His colleague, Wu Chung-shu, said on the same occasion that
Taiwan's exports next year will not be as good as in the past, but as
exports of electrical and information products in recent months have
shown signs of picking up, the worst should be over.</P>
      <P>Although exports are picking up, weak domestic demand due to the
rising unemployment and the bad loan situation will make it difficult
for the economy to recover.</P>
      <P>Consumer growth will be 3.21 percent, a far cry from the past
growth of between 6 percent and 7 percent, mainly due to the high
unemployment. Private investment will have modest growth of 2.06
percent after experiencing negative growth of 23.12 percent this
year, he predicted.</P>
      <P>Overall, he concluded, the economic situation is not
very optimistic next year, but export growth will be more solid,
stimulating a modest recovery.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  19 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China's delegation to the
World Trade Organization (WTO) will be a permanent representation on
a scale and status similar to those of other WTO member countries,
sources from the Executive Yuan said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>In a closed-door, nine-member meeting of the Presidential Office,
the Executive Yuan and the ruling Democratic Progressive Party held
late Tuesday, President Chen Shui-bian was quoted as saying that the
establishment of the ROC delegation at WTO headquarters in Geneva
should not be scrimped because of financial considerations and that
hopefully the delegation will be formally inaugurated Jan. 1, 2002,
the day Taiwan becomes a full member of the world trade regulatory
body.</P>
      <P>Taiwan finished its application process Nov. 11, when a WTO
ministerial conference in Doha, Qatar, approved its admittance,
ending the country's 12-year pursuit of WTO membership.</P>
      <P>According to Chiou I-jen, secretary-general of the Executive
Yuan, Tuesday's meeting did not discuss who will be appointed the
ROC's first head delegate to the WTO or the line-up of the ROC
delegation.</P>
      <P>The meeting, however, decided that the inaugural ROC delegation
will comprise 16 members, including a head representative, two deputy
representatives and six officials from the Ministry of Economic
Affairs (MOEA), three officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,
two officials from the Council of Agriculture, one official from the
Ministry of Finance and one "alternative" official to be appointed by
the top representative for the ad hoc mission.</P>
      <P>Basically, the ROC's WTO delegation will be a 36-member
diplomatic operation overseas, which will be allocated an annual
budget of NT$200 million (US$5.8 million), according to Chiou.</P>
      <P>It was undecided whether the delegation will be located at the
existing MOEA office in Geneva or whether it will be based at another
location, Chiou said.</P>
      <P>He noted that based on the WTO formula, Taiwan will seek to join
other international organizations in the future, including the World
Intellectual Property Rights Organization, the World Customs
Organization, the International Standards Organization and the
Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHINA SHIPBUILDING FACING FINANCIAL CRISIS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  Dec.  19 (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The state-run China Shipbuilding Corp.
(CSC) is facing serious financial crisis, and the management is
calling on the employees to support a "company readjustment" --
layoffs and salary cuts.</P>
      <P>A company spokesman said Tuesday that CSC's operational losses
have amounted to NT$10.5 billion against its capital investment of
NT$11 billion and that the company is facing imminent bankruptcy if
no emergency measures are taken.</P>
      <P>A representative of the workers union said meanwhile that the
employees had not received their salaries for December.</P>
      <P>The company spokesman said that management has promised to pay
the employees just one-third of their monthly salaries Dec. 20. In
the meantime, he went on, the company is trying to borrow money from
other state enterprises. Employees will be able to receive their
salaries on regular pay days, he said, but only if CSC can borrow
money from the Taiwan Sugar Corp. (TSC) and the Taiwan Salt
Industrial Corp. (TSIC).</P>
      <P>TSC and TSIC are among the few state-run enterprises still making
money. In order to improve the financial structure of the state
enterprises, the Ministry of Economic Affairs has instructed six
loss-making state-run enterprises to submit readjustment programs and
to improve their operations before the ministry will grant any rescue
packages.</P>
      <P>In addition to the CSC, the Aerospace Industrial Development
Corp., the Tang Eng Iron Works, Co. Ltd., the Kaohsiung Ammonium
Sulfate Co., Ltd., the Taiwan Agricultural and Industrial Development
Corp., and the Taiwan Machinery Manufacturing Corp. are also required
to submit readjustment programs.</P>
      <P>The CSC management recently submitted a draft of it readjustment
program to the Ministry of Economic affairs, hoping that the
Executive Yuan will set aside a rescue fund to help the company carry
out its slimming program.</P>
      <P>CSC has proposed reducing its staff by 47 percent, from over
5,000 to less than 2,800, while the survivors will face a 35 percent
salary cut starting next year.</P>
      <P>While the workers union is reluctant to agree to the program, the
company management is in a dilemma. The Economics Ministry requires
CSC to submit a list of staff members who agree to take early
retirements before granting the company a special rescue fund. On the
other hand, the program is not finalized because the management has
had difficulty persuading 2,500 employees sign the early retirement
agreement.</P>
      <P>CSC Vice President Liu Wu-hsien said that the CSC management has
decided to submit a list of people who will be laid off to the
Commission of National Corporations under the Economics Ministry next
week to manifest the company's determination to implement its
readjustment program. The ministry may then agree to have TSC and
TSIC lend money to CSC.</P>
      <P>He said that the Executive Yuan has agreed to set aside NT$9
billion as a CSC special pension fund and another NT$6 billion for
CSC reinvestment projects next year. However, CSC is required to
implement the readjustment program before the end of December.</P>
      <P>CSC was set up in July 1973 with two shipyards each in Kaohsiung
and Keelung. The company had its glory days in the 1980s and early
1990s. However, it has suffered serious losses in recent years amid
the recession.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's first two financial holding
companies were established Wednesday, marking a milestone in the
island's financial reform.</P>
      <P>The Hua Nan Financial Holdings Co. started operations after
receiving a license delivered in person by Minister of Finance Yen

      <P>Yen said that the recent enactment of the financial holding
company law enables financial institutions to engage in businesses
previously beyond their areas of operation.</P>
      <P>Late last month, the Ministry of Finance approved the
applications by six financial groups to set up holding companies.</P>
      <P>Yen noted that the financial reforms being carried out by his

institutions, but will also provide a mechanism for mergers.</P>
      <P>He predicted that Taiwan's financial institutions will become

      <P>Later, the minister visited the Fubon Financial Holding Co. to

      <P>Taiwan enjoys an edge in terms of
geography, transport and trade in its plan to become a global
logistics center in Asia, an economic official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Ho Mei-yueh, vice chairwoman of the Council for Economic Planning

on global logistics that gathered freight forwarders from Taipei,
Beijing, Hong Kong and Macau.</P>

sailing time of five other major harbors in the Asia-Pacific region
and that the island is within an average of two hours and 55 minutes
flying time of seven major cities in the western Pacific.</P>
      <P>Ho said that Kaohsiung port in the south of Taiwan and Keelung
port in the north can handle large commercial ships, adding that
Kaohsiung port ranked fourth in terms of the world's container ports
in 2000, while the volume of container handling grew by 6.3 percent

      <P>She also said that cross-Taiwan Strait relations have become
closer, with the amount of Taiwan investment in the mainland approved

Taiwan investment in the mainland reached US$1.3 billion, while the
government has also expanded the functions of Taiwan's offshore

Xiamen in the mainland can be stored in bonded warehouses in
Kaohsiung and processed for transshipment to third countries.</P>

      <P>The Republic of China is a "free nation"
with its rate of freedom on a level similar to 30 other "free
nations" including Britain, France, Japan and Germany, according to a

Washington, D.C.</P>
      <P>The council made the declaration to honor Chiang, formerly a
section chief at the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative
Office in Washington and now director of the Taipei Economic and
Cultural Office in Seattle, for his contributions to relations
between Taipei and Washington.</P>

Chinese communities and Washington. He assumed his duties in Seattle
last month.</P>

receive the honor, thanked Council Speaker Linda Cropp and all the
councilmen for their commendation and said that "his heart is still
in Washington, D.C." He added his hope that the United States will
continue to strengthen relations with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The Council of District of Columbia has also adopted resolutions
to honor Oct. 10 -- Republic of China National Day -- many times over
the years.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Dec.  19  (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Academia Sinica's Institute of
Economics announced Wednesday that it had adjusted downward an
earlier forecast for the Republic of China's economic growth in 2001
from 2.38 percent to minus 1.89 percent.</P>
      <P>In a report on the nation's economic prospects, the institute
said that the domestic economy is expected to bottom out in the
fourth quarter of this year and that 3.08 percent economic growth can
be expected for the coming year.</P>
      <P>The institute forecast the economic growth rates in the four
quarters of next year at 1.04 percent, 2.39 percent, 4.58 percent and
4.16 percent, respectively.</P>
      <P>Also that day, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) released its
World Economic Outlook report in which Taiwan was listed 28th among
29 advanced economies in terms of real GDP (gross domestic product)
growth.</P>
      <P>The IMF report indicates that with GDP growth of minus 2.2
percent, Taiwan's real GDP growth in 2001 was far behind the average
of 5.6 percent among the developing economies in Asia.</P>
      <P>For the coming year, the IMF predicts that Taiwan's real GDP will
grow by 0.7 percent, lower than most Asian economies. It further
predicted that among Taiwan's major trading partners and competitors,
the United States will attain growth of 0.7 percent, mainland China
will grow 6.8 percent, Japan will grow 0.1 percent, Hong Kong will
grow 1 percent, and South Korea will grow 3.2 percent.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CANADIAN GOV'T WON'T COMMIT TO HELPING TAIWAN GAIN WHO ADMISSION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa, Dec. 19 (CNA)
(By S.C. CHANG)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Canada's foreign minister refused to commit
the Canadian government to helping democratic Taiwan join the World
Health Organization (WHO) when recently challenged on the subject.</P>
      <P>Foreign Affairs Minister John Manley invoked Canada's
long-standing "one China" policy to reject a request by Member of
Parliament Svend Robinson on Dec. 10 that Canada "recognize reality
and support Taiwan's participation in the World Health Organization
and other international bodies."</P>
      <P>"We recognize one China and we recognize the need for the
government elected in Taiwan to work within the context of a policy,
which is held in common by most countries, of recognizing a single
China," Manley said.</P>
      <P>Manley shunned another request from the New Democratic Party
member of parliament to lift Canada's visa requirement for visitors
from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Robinson said the 23 million people of "the independent sovereign
state of Taiwan" were recently admitted into the WTO and, at the
start of December, participated in vigorous national elections which
led to a "historic victory by President Chen Shui-bian's Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP)."</P>
      <P>Manley pointed out that Robinson was quite right in depicting
Taiwan as a lively democracy, saying that "it was a very vigorous
election campaign with a very interesting result for everyone
observing it."</P>
      <P>Robinson was in Taiwan in late November to observe Taiwan's
legislative as well as county and city chief elections held Dec. 1.
The DPP won the largest number of seats in the Republic of China
Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>After returning to Canada, he issued a statement in Parliament
congratulating President Chen and the DPP for their "impressive
victory" and praising Taiwan for the vitality of its democracy.</P>
      <P>"It is time now for the international community to welcome Taiwan
as an international sovereign state, which includes granting it
membership in the World Health Organization," he said.</P>
      <P>"As well, the Canadian government should end its kowtowing to the
mainland regarding its visa policies for visits to Canada by
government officials from Taiwan, such as the recently proposed visit
by the minister of health, and remove the visa requirement for
Taiwanese visitors to Canada," Robinson said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EX HIGHER-UP KICKS OFF `PEACE-OF-MIND TASK' BY SELLING BOXED LUNCHES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  20 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Control Yuan President Chen Li-an,
who had also served as defense minister and Kuomintang deputy
secretary-general, kicked off his ambitious "Peace-of-Mind Task"
Thursday by selling reasonably-priced boxed lunches.</P>
      <P>Chen announced the launch of his undertaking aimed at helping the
people of Taiwan lead better lives amid economic distress, using the
motto "no fear, always at ease."</P>
      <P>The son of the late Republic of China Vice President Chen Cheng
said that of the various planned aspects of the "Peace-of-Mind Task,"
the selling of boxed lunches should be the most pragmatic as well as
the easiest in terms of participants in the undertaking achieving
their goals.</P>
      <P>A devout Buddhist, Chen's lunch boxes are all vegetarian,
initially being offered only in Taipei City during lunch time mainly
to office workers.</P>
      <P>"It's not easy to make vegetarian meals tasty and economic," Chen
said, adding that his strategy team, made up mainly of members from
the staff of the Chen Cheng Cultural and Educational Foundation, have
seen to it that through a centrally-controlled production line and
distribution network, the vegetarian lunch boxes are both enjoyable
and affordable at NT$60 (US$1.74).</P>
      <P>Since the undertaking is designed to help regular people
economically, the foundation recruited 22 unemployed people from the
files of the Council of Labor Affairs, hiring them to be workers at
the boxed lunch operation.</P>
      <P>The foundation then signed contracts with 50
physically-challenged people, helping them to retail the vegetarian
boxed lunches.</P>
      <P>Chen estimated that initially, the boxed lunch enterprise will
create job opportunities for 500 to 1,000 people.</P>
      <P>According to Chiu Ching-liang, one of the contracted
physically-challenged members, he makes a net profit of NT$10 from
each boxed lunch sold. If he can manage to sell 50 lunch boxes each
noon, he will make more than NT$10,000 per month -- an income which
he says is "not bad" for a person who originally sold lottery tickets
on the street.</P>
      <P>Currently, the boxed lunches are available at 50 distribution
points around Taipei, Chen said, adding that the operation will be
expanded to other cities and counties in northern Taiwan if the
program turns out to be a success in Taipei City.</P>
      <P>When asked about the "trivial" and "moderate" scale of the boxed
lunch enterprise as compared to his high-level background, Chen, who
lost his bid for the Republic of China presidency to Lee Teng-hui in
the 1996 election, said "making boxed lunches is not an easy task at
all."</P>
      <P>To help start the boxed lunch operation, Chen personally pitched
in, getting to know the prices of the needed ingredients, such as
rice and vegetables, as well as becoming familiar with GMP (a
government-imposed quality standard for manufactured products) and
the sanitary standards for ready-to-serve foods.</P>
      <P>"Now, I have finally come to realize how shallow officials are in
terms of their perception of things," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Chen's pragmatism has already begun to inspire people. An
unemployed 40-something man who had never in his life thought about
being out of a job until this year, said that "if Chen can sell boxed
lunches, why can't I drive a taxi cab?"</P>
      <P>You can do anything once you cast aside the notion of "face,"
Chen told the man.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that there are probably many things in the past that
he should have done that he didn't and that he must therefore bear
some responsibility for the problems Taiwan society is now facing, he
said that the "Peace-of-Mind Task" is merely "a 65-year-old retired
official's atonement."</P>
      <P>Chen vowed to carry out the undertaking successfully, saying that
he hopes the lunch box enterprise is just the starting point.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SUSPENSION OF TAIWAN-HONG KONG AIR TRAFFIC NOT PROBABLE: MAC HEAD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 20 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Air links between Taiwan and Hong Kong will
not stop after the aviation agreement between the two expires at the
end of the year, said Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairwoman Tsai
Ing-wen, Thursday.</P>
      <P>Tsai said the probability of a suspension of air traffic was
"zero," adding that officials are currently addressing the issue.</P>
      <P>Local media has reported that air services between Taiwan and
Hong Kong could be disrupted when the aviation accord expires at the
end of the year as a result of Beijing's interference.</P>
      <P>Fielding questions at the Legislative Yuan, Tsai said there is no
possibility for the Taiwan-Hong Kong air links to be disrupted,
adding that she would not comment further until details of the issue
had been hammered out.</P>
      <P>Under the current Taiwan-Hong Kong aviation pact signed in 1996,
the two sides must review the agreement every five years. When the
pact expired June 12 this year, the two sides failed to meet to
review the accord, although they agreed to extend it to the end of
this year.</P>
      <P>Although the pact's new expiration date is drawing near, sources
close to the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) said that the
agency has still not been able to prepare an agenda for negotiations.</P>
      <P>The CAA, under the Ministry of Transportation and Communications,
is responsible for arranging technical details for talks, but since
Hong Kong reverted to mainland Chinese rule in July 1997, the MAC,
which charts Taiwan's policy toward mainland China, has taken charge
of issues related to Hong Kong, including civil aviation affairs.</P>
      <P>At present, Taiwan and Hong Kong are each allowed to operate 121
flights between the two destinations per week. Of Taiwan's quota,
China Airlines accounts for 105 flights and EVA Airways operates the
remaining 16 flights.</P>
      <P>On the Hong Kong side, Cathay Pacific Airways accounts for 100
flights and Dragonair is allowed to operate 21 flights.</P>
      <P>Both EVA and Dragonair hope that the aviation accord can be
revised to allow them to operate more flights as the demand for
Taiwan-Hong Kong flight services has continued to rise, despite the
current economic downturn.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NO TAIWAN BUSINESSMEN ON MAINLAND HAVE JOINED CPC: OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  20 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government is not aware of any Taiwan
businessmen who have invested in mainland China that have joined the
Communist Party of China (CPC), Vice Minister of Economic Affairs
Chen Ruey-rong said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks when fielding questions in the Legislative
Yuan during which legislator Chiu Chui-chen of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party expressed concern over the establishment of CPC
operations in Taiwan-financed companies on the mainland.</P>
      <P>Chiu claimed that the Shenzhen-based branch of Taiwan's Hon Hai
Precision Industry Co. has established a CPC cell. He also said that
even well-known companies like Formosa Plastics and President
Enterprises have organized CPC branches in their mainland Chinese
operations.</P>
      <P>Chiu said that the situation has become a serious problem and
wondered what would happen if Taiwan nationals joined the CPC and
then returned to Taiwan -- they could then vote for political
candidates on the island with similar views.</P>
      <P>Vice Minister Chen replied by saying that the CPC is still an
illegal organization in Taiwan and that if Taiwan businessmen join
the CPC they will be violating ROC statutes.</P>
      <P>But he said that as far as he knows, only mainland staff of Hon
Hai's Shenzhen affiliate, Foxconn, have joined the CPC and that no
Taiwan businessmen have joined.</P>
      <P>Foxconn, established in Shenzhen in 1988 with a workforce of
38,000 people, is reported to be an overseas holding company
registered in a third country.</P>
      <P>Chen also said that mainland authorities should concentrate more
on protecting the well-being of Taiwan businessmen and their
investments, not trying to push their political views on Taiwan
nationals.</P>
      <P>Minister of Economic Affairs Lin Hsin-yi had said the previous
day that reports of Taiwan businessmen joining the CPC were unfounded
and that there was no attempt by the CPC to infiltrate
Taiwan-financed businesses and industrial operations in mainland
China.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SENIOR CITIZENS MAY BE GRANTED MONTHLY STIPEND STARTING 2002</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  20 (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Senior citizens may be getting a NT$3,000
monthly stipend from the government if opposition parties can agree
on how the program is to be implemented.</P>
      <P>The Health, Environment and Social Welfare Committee of the
Legislative Yuan Wednesday approved the NT$16 billion budget proposal
for the senior citizen stipend program to be carried out in fiscal
2002. However, legislators of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and
People First Party insisted that a senior citizen stipend provisional
act should first be adopted before the stipend program is
implemented.</P>
      <P>Tsai Huang-lang, secretary-general of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP), said that the Executive Yuan could decide on
the implementation of the program with the Senior Citizen Welfare Law
as its legal basis.</P>
      <P>Tsai suggested that political parties in the Legislative Yuan
settle the issue through negotiations in the plenary meeting
scheduled for mid-January. If consensus is reached, the program would
then be in force retroactive from Jan. 1, he added.</P>
      <P>Around 440,000 senior citizens are expected to be covered by the
program. A senior citizen, defined as a person 65 years of age or
older, with an annual income of NT$500,000 or more, or in possession
of real assets worth NT$5 million or more, would not be entitled to
the payments, according to Minister of the Interior Chang Po-ya.</P>
      <P>Chang guaranteed that the financial sources have been secured to
implement the stipend program for the next four years until 2005,
when the government starts the senior citizen annuity program.</P>
      <P>According to the Executive Yuan's budget planning, the NT$16
billion set aside for the senior citizen stipend program in 2002 will
come mostly from budget cuts in various ministries and departments of
the Executive Yuan.</P>
      <P>The senior citizen annuity was a campaign promise of the ruling
party. It has given rise to much controversy and the government's
financial ability to support the program has been questioned by
opposition politicians.</P>
      <P>In the past years, elderly residents in some of the DPP-governed
cities and counties were granted living allowances. However, most of
these welfare programs were carried out only for a short period of
time because of financial constraints of the domestic
administrations.</P>
      <P>The elderly population has continued to rise in Taiwan over the
past decade. In 1989, senior citizens numbered 1.2 million,
representing 6 percent of Taiwan's overall population. As of the end
of September, 2000, the number rose to 1.9 million, representing 8.6
percent of the population.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan is entering the group nations considered to be senior
societies, the government has made economic security and protection
of the elderly a major goal in its social welfare planning. A
national senior citizen annuity program is being planned and is
expected to be implemented starting 2005.</P>

    <DATELINE>Washington,  Dec.  19  (CNA)
(By Jay Chen and Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The U.S. Congress passed a bill
Wednesday requiring President George W. Bush's administration to come
up with a plan to help Taiwan obtain observer status in the World
Health Organization (WHO).</P>
      <P>The representatives passed the bill without objection after
Republican representative from New York Benjamin Gilman, who is
chairman of the Committee on International Relations, and Tom Lantos,
a California Democrat, called for support for the bill.</P>
      <P>The bill is aimed to amend a similar bill signed by President
Bush in May.</P>
      <P>The original bill requiring the administration to help Taiwan get
observer status by May, 2001 was signed into law by President Bush
when the WHO annual summit in Geneva had already concluded.</P>
      <P>Wednesday's bill changes the date from May. 2001 to May, 2002.</P>
      <P>It also adds to the original bill a mention of President Bush's
promise to Sen. Frank Murkowski, made in a letter dated May 11 to
the Alaska Republican, that the United States "should find
opportunities for Taiwan's voice to be heard in international
organizations in order to make a contribution, even if membership is
not possible."</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the new bill also points to Secretary of Health and
Human Services Tommy Thompson's statement on May 16 to the effect
that the U.S. administration supports Taiwan's participation in the
activities of the WHO.</P>
      <P>This bill, which was introduced by Rep. Sherrod Brown, a Democrat
from Ohio, will now be referred to the Senate for debate before going
on to the president for his signature.</P>
      <P>Taipei, riding on Congress' support, is calling on the Bush
administration to follow its promise with concrete plans to support
Taipei's bid for observer status at the next WHO summit.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.S. EXPERT WARNS OF MAINLAND CHINESE AIR FORCE MODERNIZATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Dec.  19  (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung and Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The mainland Chinese air force could
overwhelm a single carrier's defenses if that is all the United
States could send to aid Taiwan in the event of an armed conflict in
the Taiwan Strait, a U.S. expert on mainland military developments
warned in a recently published article.</P>
      <P>Richard D. Fisher Jr., a senior fellow at the Jamestown
Foundation, a Washington-based think tank, wrote in the most recent
issue of Jamestown's China Brief that it is therefore "correct" for
the Pentagon to call for an increased U.S. military presence in the
Western Pacific region in its September 2001 Quadrennial Review.</P>
      <P>By 2005, Fisher wrote, the People's Liberation Army Air Force
(PLAAF) will pose a much more formidable threat to Taiwan and to U.S.
forces in Asia. It could help destroy Taiwan's defenses in a large
pre-emptive strike when coordinated with massive missile strikes, he
added.</P>
      <P>"Ongoing PLAAF modernization makes necessary appropriate U.S.
measures to ensure the deterrence of conflict in the Taiwan Strait,"
Fisher wrote, because "absent countervailing actions by Taiwan and
the United States, by 2005 the PLA Air Force could begin to gain
superiority" in the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Fisher wrote that according to newspaper reports, the PLAAF sent
its new Sukhoi Su-30MKK fighter jets out to the mid-line of the
Taiwan Strait in early November as if to intimidate Taiwan before the
island's Dec. 1 legislative elections.</P>
      <P>He went on to write that it is important to watch the PLAAF
because in any future conflict, a short-range ballistic missile might
carry only a 1,000 pound warhead once, but a strike fighter like the
Russian-made Su-30MKK can carry about 17,000 pounds over scores of
missions.</P>
      <P>"A war's outcome will depend on the PLA's ability to secure and
exploit effective air superiority in the Taiwan theater of
operations," he wrote.</P>
      <P>Fisher attributed the drive behind the PLAAF's modernization to
the growing political goal identified by Beijing leaders to "build a
modern PLA capable of playing a key role in forcing unification with
Taiwan under Beijing's terms."</P>
      <P>Quoting recent reports, Fisher wrote that the PLAAF could acquire
between 300 and 400 modern multi-role fighters by 2005 that are
capable of all-weather attack missions with modern precision-guided
weapons. These aircraft could include 100 Su-30MKKs and hundreds of
indigenously built Chengdu J-10 fighters, he added.</P>
      <P>In terms of airborne forces, Fisher quoted reports that suggest
that the 15th Airborne Army might be substantially expanded to a
force that exceeds 50,000 men.</P>
      <P>"The danger is that such a force could prove instrumental in
either scaring Taiwan into submission, or, if used correctly, could
deliver the final blow needed to force Taiwan's surrender," Fisher
wrote.</P>

      <P>A consortium of leading
telecommunication companies launched services Thursday on the Asia
Pacific Cable Network 2 (APCN 2), the world's first Asian submarine
ring system.</P>
      <P>The APCN 2 System comprises 19,000 km of cable connecting
mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, the
Philippines and Singapore. Consortium members have invested over US$1
billion in the project, which uses the most advanced fiber-optic
technology deploying state-of-the-art technology.</P>
      <P>The major investors in the system include Cable &amp; Wireless, China
Telecom, China Unicom, Chunghwa Telecom, Concert, Global One, Japan

NCIC, PLDT, Reach, StarHub, SingTel, Taiwan Fixed Network, Teleglobe,
Telekom Malaysia and Williams Communications.</P>
      <P>Rab Paramothayan, management committee chairman for the APCN 2
System, said: "In addition to providing intra-Asian connectivity,
APCN 2 will also provide seamless interconnection with other major
Trans-Pacific cable networks that provide connectivity to the United

      <P>NEC Corporation is the exclusive contractor of the system supply

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 20 (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Thursday that
he has been maintaining a low profile and monitoring the situation
since the Dec. 1 elections so that next year's Cabinet reshuffle can
bring about a turning point for national reform and establish a
foundation for economic development.</P>
      <P>In a meeting with visiting U.S. Representative Robert Wexler,
Chen said that although the ruling Democratic Progressive Party had
good results in the elections -- becoming the largest party in the
Legislative Yuan for the first time -- he was neither excited nor
proud, but rather even more humble because the people gave the party
a chance that it should treasure.</P>
      <P>Chen told the Florida Democrat that he is confident in the future
and that he believes cross-Taiwan Strait relations will become even
more stable, the economy will continue to develop and various
democratic reforms will be promoted and completed.</P>
      <P>The president said that the U.S. government and Congress can play
the role of cross-strait stabilizer, balancer and "messenger of
peace." The ROC government supports the development of a constructive
relationship between the United States and mainland China but hopes
that such a development will not affect or sacrifice Taiwan's
interests.</P>
      <P>Chen thanked Wexler, who is a member of the House International
Relations Committee, for his long-time support of the Republic of
China's bid to participate in various international organizations.</P>
      <P>After Taiwan officially becomes a World Trade Organization member
next year, the island hopes to become an observer in the World Health
Organization and ultimately a member in the United Nations, the
president added.</P>
      <P>Wexler arrived in Taiwan Tuesday for a four-day visit, his first
trip to Taiwan. He has called on U.S. President George W. Bush to
continue selling arms to Taiwan and to support the island's bid for
membership in international organizations.</P>

      <P>The president of the Taiwan Research
Institute (TRI) predicted Thursday that the island's real economic
growth rate next year is likely to reach 3 percent.</P>
      <P>Liu Tai-ying made the remarks after attending a symposium on
Taiwan's entry into the World Trade Organization, which was jointly
sponsored by the TRI and the Cabinet-level Research, Development and
Evaluation Commission.</P>
      <P>Liu noted that various economic indices at home and abroad have
begun rising -- especially the leading index for the U.S. economy --
and added that stock markets around the world are also recovering.</P>
      <P>He admitted that it is difficult to make a precise prediction
amid the recent large-scale fluctuations of the world economy, but
went on to say that he has become more optimistic about Taiwan's
economic performance than he was a few weeks ago.</P>
      <P>Early this month, the TRI said that Taiwan's economy would
register a significant recovery in the second half of next year,
predicting a growth of 3.97 percent for the July-December period of
2002 and 2.24 percent for the whole year of 2002.</P>
      <P>Regarding the devaluation of Taiwan's currency against the
greenback, Liu said that the value of the new Taiwan dollar is

      <P>The exchange rate on the Taipei foreign exchange for the day was
NT$34.756, down NT$0.029 from the preceding day.</P>
      <P>The researcher attributed the recent rise of the local stock

      <P>The relationship between Senegal
and the Republic of China is stable and if ROC Vice President Annette
Lu visits Dakar on her way to Gambia, she will get an enthusiastic
welcome, ROC ambassador to Dakar Tou Chen-seng said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Tou denounced as groundless speculation reports in a Taiwan
newspaper that ties between Dakar and Taipei could be in danger after
the country, which is usually the gateway to Gambia, was deliberately
skipped by Lu on her way to the Gambian president's inauguration.</P>
      <P>The reports said that instead of flying to Gambia from Senegal,
Lu tried to make her way to Western Europe, but had to delay her trip
for one day because of the diplomatic red tape surrounding her
transit stop in the unnamed Western European country.</P>
      <P>Tou said Senegal President Abdoulaye Wade is very friendly toward
the ROC. He visited Taipei in July, and struck up a "firm personal
friendship" with ROC President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>Senegal Prime Minister Moustapha Niasse and Foreign Minister
Jacques Baudin also set great store on their country's friendship
with the ROC and Tou added that the relationship between Dakar and
Taipei is even better than it was before the presidential elections
in March 2000.</P>
      <P>The ambassador said the agricultural cooperation between the two
countries is the best witness of the steadfast friendship and added
that Taiwan's technical mission has created an "agricultural miracle"
in the West African country by turning it from a rice importer to a
rice exporter with Taiwan's advanced rice-cultivation technology.</P>
      <P>Lu was scheduled to leave Taipei on Tuesday night for the Gambian
capital of Banjul, but was forced to make a last-minute
postponement.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN WELCOMES OECD DECISION ON OBSERVER STATUS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  20 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Fair Trade Commission (FTC) under the
Executive Yuan announced Thursday that the island has been admitted
by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)
as an observer to its Competition Law and Policy Committee.</P>
      <P>The move signifies international confirmation of Taiwan's efforts
to ensure fair trade practices on the island and marks a another
major breakthrough in Taiwan's international economic ties after it
won the admittance to World Trade Organization, the FTC said in a
press release.</P>
      <P>Observer status at the Competition Law and Policy Committee will
pay the way for the island's bids for similar status at other OECD
committees and its ultimate full membership of the OECD, according to
FTC officials.</P>
      <P>The status will offer Taiwan a valuable glimpse into the process
through which international fair trade criteria are made and
therefore bring its own trade practices into harmony with
international standards, the officials added.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has been endeavoring to join the OECD Competition Law and
Policy Committee since 1998, but its application had been rejected on
political grounds until earlier this year and in July, Taiwan's
request was primarily approved.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has in fact been closely associated with the OECD in
recent years and the FTC has co-sponsored international symposia on
competition strategy three years in a row. Officials from Thailand,
Vietnam, Malaysia, the Philippines, Indonesia, Singapore and Hong
Kong were invited to exchange views in these symposia.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's co-sponsorship has helped make the country a model of
fair trading in Southeast Asia, the officials said.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) also lauded OECD observer
status as a valuable chance for the island to tout its achievements
in ensuring fair trade.</P>
      <P>MOEA officials noted that mainland China was also granted
observer status to the OECD's Science and Technology Committee that
day.</P>
      <P>Reports said Taiwan's and mainland China's applications were
discussed Dec. 14 by the OECD Committee on Cooperative Relations of
non-member countries.</P>
      <P>The OECD, known as the "rich men's club," is an association of 30
nations mainly in Western Europe, North America and the Pacific
working to promote the economic and social welfare of its members and
coordinating efforts to aid developing countries. Of its 30 members,
Japan and South Korea are the only full Asian members, while Hong
Kong and Singapore are observers.</P>
      <P>Taiwan will join the ranks of five other OECD observers, namely
Russia, Argentine, Israel, Brazil and Lithuania.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC V.P. WARMLY RECEIVED IN GAMBIA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Banjul,  Gambia,  Dec. 20 (CNA)
(By M.J. Tzou and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu, at the
head of a special Republic of China diplomatic delegation, arrived in
Banjul Thursday to a red-carpet welcome by the Gambian government.</P>
      <P>Lu and her entourage, which includes Vice Foreign Affairs
Minister Chiu Jong-nan, flew via Paris to Gambia to attend on behalf
of President Chen Shui-bian the inauguration of reelected Gambian
President Yahya Jammeh slated for Friday.</P>
      <P>Gambian Vice President Isatou Njie-Saidy met Lu in person at the
airport, where Lu and the ROC delegation were honored with a military
salute.</P>
      <P>Limousines escorted by a police motorcade then took them to their
hotel from the airport. Huge crowds of local villagers and students
welcomed the ROC guests by waving small flags and banners of the ROC
on both sides of the road.</P>
      <P>Lu met with President Jammeh in the evening to present him with a
copy of her credentials regarding her current mission in Banjul. She
said she is confident that bilateral relations between Gambia and
Taiwan will be further bolstered under the leadership of Jammeh
during his new term in office.</P>
      <P>President Chen offered his personal felicitations to Jammeh on
Oct. 22 upon the reelection of the Gambian president, who garnered an
overwhelming 52.96 percent of the vote in the country's November
presidential election.</P>
      <P>Jammeh staged a coup as a military officer in 1994, overthrowing
the corrupt Gambian regime of the time. He then ran in the 1997
presidential race in his capacity as a civilian and was elected with
a large mandate from the voters.</P>
      <P>To mark Jammeh's reelection and the unique way of voting in
Gambia, namely the use of marbles as ballots, Lu presented Jammeh
with a box of 1.5 million marbles as a gift. Lu said that Gambia's
use of marbles to vote reflects "fairness and transparency" and
democratic ways which she said should be emulated by other African
countries.</P>
      <P>During her stay in Gambia, Lu is expected to hold talks with
Gambian leaders as well as inspect the ROC Embassy and agricultural
projects being implemented under cooperation agreements between the
two countries.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FOUR TAIWANESE SUPERMARKETS IN ARGENTINA LOOTED, ONE OWNER INJURED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Panama  City,  Dec.  21  (CNA)
(By Oscar Chung and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Four Taiwanese supermarkets in
Argentina were looted during rioting that began Wednesday, and one of
the supermarket owners reportedly suffered injuries to the ears,
Republic of China diplomatic sources in Buenos Aires said Friday.</P>
      <P>The four Taiwanese-owned supermarkets were reportedly stormed and
emptied by looters and jobless rioters, whom Argentine riot police
responded to with tear gas and rubber bullets.</P>
      <P>One owner, whose Chinese name is Ho Er-hui, suffered cuts on his
ears during the looting, part of the worst rioting in Argentina in a
decade.</P>
      <P>As of Thursday, the rioting had left at least 22 people dead and
200 injured in Argentina. President Fernando De la Rua resigned after
two turbulent years in power, his government crumbling as
demonstrators across Argentina battled police to protest the
country's lengthy period of economic woes.</P>
      <P>Officials from the Republic of China Representative Office in
Buenos Aires said it will take time to determine whether other ROC
citizens or expatriates have also been injured or have experienced
damage to their property.</P>
      <P>According to the ROC officials, Ho and his wife emigrated to
Argentina some 20 years ago, taking over operations of the
supermarket located in a neighborhood on the outskirts of Buenos
Aires only three weeks ago. A crying Ho said that "all is gone" after
the looters ransacked and cleared out the store.</P>
      <P>Wang Yu-yuan, the ROC's top representative in Argentina, said he
has already asked Argentina's chief police officer to provide
stepped-up protection for ROC citizens and expatriates so as to
prevent them from being further hurt during the unrest.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, reports from Taiwan's southern port city of Kaohsiung
quoted officials from an association of Taiwan ocean-going squid
fishing boats as saying that squid fishing operations near Argentine
waters -- the largest squid fishing ground for Taiwan squid fishing
boats -- remained unaffected by the unrest in the country.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LEGISLATIVE YUAN APPROVES WORKPLACE GENDER EQUALITY BILL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  21  (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan Friday morning
approved the Workplace Gender Equality Bill after the third reading,
with the new law effective as of March 8, 2002.</P>
      <P>The new law states that employees should be treated equally in
terms of salary, promotions and assignments. It also requires
employers to take measures to eliminate sexual harassment in the
workplace.</P>
      <P>With the implementation of the new law, an employee, whether male
or female, who has worked for an establishment with 30 employees or
more for at least one year may request an unpaid leave of up to two
years before his or her child turns three years old in order to take
care of the child.</P>
      <P>Employees with children under the age of three may also request a
reduction in their work hours of up to one hour per day or
adjustments to their work schedule.</P>
      <P>Since 1990, women's organizations and other lobbying groups have
dedicated much effort toward promoting gender equality in the
workplace. The first version of the bill was drafted by the women's
organization Awakening Foundation and other civil groups in 1990.</P>
      <P>In the past decade, different versions of the draft by the
authorities and the private sector were discussed by the Executive
Yuan. The Cabinet passed a draft of the Workplace Gender Equality
Bill in March 1999.</P>
      <P>A spokeswoman of the Awakening Foundation said Friday that the
new bill was approved after the relentless efforts of many people.
Despite the fact that 45 percent of females in Taiwan are employed,
women in Taiwan still face work-related inequalities, she added.</P>
      <P>The spokeswoman stressed the importance of both employees and
employers having a full understanding of the new bill. She also
called for related government agencies to work out supplementary
measures so that the new law can be effectively enforced.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FINANCE MINISTER CALLS ON STOCK EXCHANGE TO IMPROVE COMPETITIVENESS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  21  (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Finance Minister Yen Ching-chang said
Friday that the Taiwan Stock Exchange Corp. (TSEC) should improve its
competitiveness through further internationalization and
liberalization and better auditing.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the TSEC's 40th founding anniversary, Yen said that
the stock market has effectively channeled savings into investment.
Since its inception in 1961, he said, the TSEC has served as a window
on Taiwan's economic development and has been the nucleus of the
direct financing system.</P>
      <P>The minister said that the TSEC, which started with only NT$10
million in capital investment and less than 100 staff, has developed
into an efficient operation.</P>
      <P>As of the end of November, the number of listed companies totaled
585 and the market value of listed shares amounted to NT$8.1
trillion, accounting for 80 percent of the nation's GDP (gross
domestic product), he added.</P>
      <P>The minister said that as Taiwan's stock market continues to
expand, the various securities products provided by the TSEC include
stocks, beneficiary certificates, warrants, Taiwan depository
receipts and bonds.</P>
      <P>There are around 1,000 brokers and their branches around the
island and the number of investors is nearing 7 million, representing
one-third of Taiwan's population. The daily average turnover value in
the past 11 months was NT$68.8 billion, according to the minister.</P>
      <P>Yen noted that the financial authorities are constantly reviewing
the operations of the stock market. In the past four decades, the
government has adopted a series of incentive measures to encourage
more companies with good performance to apply for listing and to help
the TSEC develop a wide variety of securities products.</P>
      <P>The minister said that in order to improve their international
competitiveness, stock markets all over the world are using new
technologies to integrate their operations while also seeking
international alliances.</P>
      <P>The domestic stock market should also reinforce its structure and
improve its services to meet the challenges ahead, he added.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  21  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian paid a personal
visit Friday to former Seibu star pitcher Kuo Tai-yuan, who recently
underwent surgery to have tumorous tissue removed from his liver.</P>
      <P>Chen was making good on a promise he made in November to visit
Kuo at home to offer his greetings to the pitcher who has made
extraordinary contributions to Taiwan baseball.</P>
      <P>Kuo, a native of Taiwan who retired from Japan's Seibu Lions
professional baseball team in 1997, was diagnosed at the Taipei
Veterans General Hospital in September this year and traveled to
Japan to have the liver surgery.</P>
      <P>Kuo was said to be pleased by Chen's visit and told the president
that he is convalescing well.</P>
      <P>Chen for his part said he admires Kuo for his outstanding
performance over the years. The two men also exchanged views on ways
to reinvigorate Taiwan baseball and improve its strength in
international competition.</P>
      <P>Chao Shih-chiang, president of the Naluwan Co. baseball agency
and himself a former star player, accompanied Chen on the visit and
said tongue in cheek that Kuo's speed of delivery has "much
regressed" -- down from 150-odd kph to a "mere" 140 kph.</P>
      <P>Chen also offered his respects to Kuo for his refusal to adopt
Japanese citizenship, despite playing in that country for so many
years.</P>
      <P>Kuo, who used to be nicknamed the "Orient Express" for his
pitching speed, returned to Taiwan with his wife and children in 1997
after retiring from Seibu Lions. His wife, Chang Chun-tsu, is a
model-turned-actress.</P>
      <P>Kuo, 40, joined the Seibu Lions in 1985 after representing Taiwan
in many regional and international baseball contests. He played a
leading role in helping Taiwan win a bronze medal at the 1984 Los
Angeles Olympic Games.</P>
      <P>During his nearly 13 years with Seibu, Kuo recorded 117 wins, 68
losses and 18 reliefs. During the period, Seibu won eight Pacific
League championships.</P>
      <P>Kuo set many outstanding records during his heyday, including
pitching a no-hitter, no-run perfect game in 1985. He has won many
awards, including a Pacific League MVP award in 1991.</P>
      <P>He decided to retire because of his age and an old wound to his
right hand, which had affected his performance in his last two
seasons in Seibu.</P>
      <P>Kuo earned more than 1 billion yen during his stint with Seibu
Lions.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 21 (CNA)
(By  Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Most job seekers in Taiwan would be willing
to accept company assignments in mainland China and some have great
interest in opportunities across the Taiwan Strait, according to a
survey conducted by 104 Job Bank.</P>
      <P>The online recruiting service center recently conducted a survey
among job seekers and executives of industrial companies in Taiwan,
the results of which show that more job seekers are inclined to
accept job assignments in mainland China, recognizing the fact that
many Taiwanese companies have invested there.</P>
      <P>The results indicate that companies involved in traditional
manufacturing industries in general are keen to invest in the
mainland, as are electronics and information-related industries that
are looking to improve their competitiveness. The service sector may
also increase its investment there once Taiwan joins the World Trade
Organization (WTO) next month, according to the survey results.</P>
      <P>Sixty percent of the job seekers who responded to the Job Bank
survey said they would accept assignments in mainland China, while
about 20 percent said that they are unsure and 17.2 percent said they

      <P>The domestic agriculture sector will be
prohibited from investing in certain agricultural items in mainland

Friday.</P>
      <P>The task force committee made up of government officials,

Chairman Lin Kuo-ching, decided to remove a screening process on 921
items of agricultural products on a list of 1,268 general items that

347 items were put on a list of items that cannot be produced there
via Taiwan investment.</P>
      <P>The prohibited items include hogs, chickens and pond-raised fish.
Lin said the committee made its decision on the grounds that such

    <HEADLINE>AGENCIES DISPUTE CREDIT FOR GAINING TAIWAN'S OECD OBSERVER STATUS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  21 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's acceptance into the Organization
of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) as an observer is a
feather in the government's cap, but two official organizations are
at loggerheads over who deserves the credit for the diplomatic
success.</P>
      <P>Huang Chung-le, chairman of the Fair Trade Commission (FTC)
blamed the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) Friday for trying to
steal the limelight by jumping the gun and releasing the news of
Taiwan's acceptance in the OECD ahead of the FTC.</P>
      <P>In a news conference initially called to announce Taiwan's
observer status at the OECD's Competition Law and Policy Committee,
Huang cried foul over the economics ministry's late Thursday night
news release.</P>
      <P>Huang said his commission learned Tuesday that Taiwan's request
to be an observer was to be granted Thursday, and consulted with the
economics ministry that day on how to break the news simultaneously.</P>
      <P>At that time, Huang said, the economics ministry agreed to give
the FTC all the credit for having secured the status, and that both
agencies would organize their own news conference to announce the
news the day after the OECD's approval -- Friday.</P>
      <P>To the surprise of the FTC, Huang said, the economics ministry
broke the news to local media Thursday night, forcing the FTC to
issue a news release of its own two hours later.</P>
      <P>He angrily pointed to Vice Minister of Economic Affairs Chen
Ruey-long and Director-General of the Board of Foreign Trade Wu
Wen-ya as the culprits behind the move to beat the FTC to the punch
in spite of the understanding between the FTC and the economics
ministry.</P>
      <P>Chen, however, denied Friday afternoon that his ministry was
trying to monopolize the credit, saying Taiwan's acceptance had been
achieved by the coordinated efforts of many government agencies,
including the foreign ministry, the economics ministry and the FTC.</P>
      <P>Chen said he didn't understand why the FTC issued its statement
two hours later than the economics ministry.</P>
      <P>Huang said his committee began to work for acceptance in the OECD
in 1995, and formally presented application forms on June 19 of this
year. He also said he had traveled to Paris on Oct. 18 to brief the
OECD about Taiwan's laws concerning fair trade.</P>
      <P>The FTC chairman said he had kept the entire affair as low-key as
possible to avoid any interference from mainland China. Huang said
that he has tried to do the right thing as a government official, but
could not stand idly by as another government body shamelessly tried
to take credit for the work of others.</P>
      <P>"They have gone too far in trying to upstage the FTC," Huang
said.</P>
      <P>The FTC kept mum about the process because mainland China was
simultaneously trying to join the OECD Science and Technology
Committee, and the FTC didn't want to draw Beijing's attention to
Taiwan's application, Huang said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING SHOULD ACCEPT NEW REALITIES IN CROSS-STRAIT TIES: MAC CHIEF</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Hualien,  eastern Taiwan, Dec. 21 (CNA)
(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China must adapt
its views on cross-Taiwan Strait relations to the changing reality
reflected in the new political landscape after the Democratic
Progressive Party's (DPP) impressive gains in the Legislative Yuan,
said Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen Friday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a year-end news conference in Hualien, Tsai that the
results of the Dec. 1 legislative elections indicated that the people
of Taiwan want to pursue a stable cross-strait relationship on the
basis of internal stability.</P>
      <P>After the elections, the ruling DPP had collected 87 seats in the
225-seat lawmaking body to replace the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) as
the largest party in the legislature.</P>
      <P>Tsai said that the general circumstances and political structure
surrounding the development of cross-strait developments are
undergoing a fundamental change in the wake of the elections.</P>
      <P>DPP policy leans toward independence for Taiwan, while the KMT
ultimately seeks unification between Taiwan and the mainland.</P>
      <P>Tsai said that she hoped that Beijing leaders will understand the
significance of the results of the elections and face the changes
pragmatically.</P>
      <P>The MAC chief called on Beijing leaders to handle the
cross-strait issue with a broader mind and to endeavor together with
Taipei to elevate bilateral relations to a new level.</P>
      <P>She urged an early resumption of bilateral talks, noting that
normal dialogues and negotiations, as well as formal interactions,
are required for the development of genuine and stable cross-strait
relations.</P>
      <P>Reviewing the government's policy toward the mainland over the
past year, Tsai said that the government has been taking positive
steps to promote cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>She pointed out that the "positive opening, effective management"
policy announced by President Chen Shui-bian recently reflected the
conclusions reached through consensus at the cross-party Economic
Development Advisory Conference this past summer.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and mainland China's entry into the World Trade
Organization (WTO) will also affect the development of cross-strait
relations, Tsai said.</P>
      <P>In the future, she said that cross-strait economic and trade
activities are expected to move toward normalization under the
framework of the WTO. Tsai said she expects that the two sides will
engage in more interactions and communications within the WTO
framework.</P>
      <P>She said that she believes the WTO memberships will provide an
important opportunity for the two sides to improve their relations
and to help stabilize the peace and stability across the Taiwan
Strait.</P>
      <P>Next year will be important for the mainland as there will be a
change of top leadership in Beijing, Tsai said, adding that a smooth
transition of power would benefit both sides of the strait.</P>
      <P>Talking about her recent visit to the United States, the MAC
chairwoman said the government's policy to maintain peace and
stability across the Taiwan Strait has been widely accepted by the
United States.</P>
      <P>She said that the Chen administration has maintained open
communications with the U.S. government and Congress and added that
she had exchanged views with U.S. officials, congressmen and
think-tank researchers during the recent trip.</P>
      <P>Tsai said that maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan
Strait and in the Asia-Pacific area is in line with the interests of
the United States. The consistency of the U.S. long-term policy
toward mainland China and Taiwan remains unchanged at present, she
said.</P>
      <P>The issue of the so-called "1992 consensus," which refers to the
"one China" principle whereby both sides of the Strait are free to
define "China," was not discussed in the United States, Tsai said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Vice President
Annette Lu presented the newly re-elected president of Gambia, Yahya
Jammeh, with 1.5 million marbles as an inauguration gift Thursday in
the capital city of Banjul.</P>
      <P>The marbles are used as ballots in Gambia, with each candidate
having his own box. Voters drop marbles into the boxes of the
candidates they favor.</P>
      <P>The marbles, with special colors and sizes, are difficult to
fake, and can be used in the next elections, Jammeh explained.</P>
      <P>There are no invalid votes when marbles are used in place of
ballots, and the possibility of election irregularities is minimized,
Jammeh said, adding that this is the system that was used when he was
re-elected president Oct. 22.</P>
      <P>Lu lauded the ingenuity of the Gambian people in making the
marble -- which is used by children in games, or as weapons by some
adults -- into ballots for use in democratic elections.</P>
      <P>She exchanged views on a broad range of issues with Jammeh and
presented him with a letter from ROC Presdient Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>According to a news release issued by Lu's entourage, Presdient
Chen sent his personal greetings to Jammeh, and looks forward to much
close ties with the west African country under Jammeh's leadership.</P>
      <P>After an evening reception, Lu attended a dinner party hosted by
ROC ambassador Lin Chun-yi.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the party, Lu said her first day in the country has
shown her that the country deserves its nickname of "the smiling
coast," because all the people she met, no matter whether they were
government officials or ordinary people, were all smiling -- a sign
of the nation's energy and vision.</P>
      <P>Lu said the close ties between Taiwan and Gambia make their
peoples feel like family despite the geographical distance between
them.</P>
      <P>Lu left Taipei Wednesday night for the Gambian capital of Banjul
via Paris and arrived Thursday.</P>
      <P>She will attend President Yahya Jammeh's Dec. 21 inauguration.</P>
      <P>During her stay in Gambia, Lu is expected to hold talks with

    <HEADLINE>REVISED LAW ALLOWS FOREIGN WORKERS TO WORK IN TAIWAN FOR SIX YEARS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 21 (CNA)
(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan approved an amendment
to the Employment Services Act Friday allowing foreign workers to
work in Taiwan up to six years.</P>
      <P>At present, blue-collar foreign workers are allowed to work in
Taiwan for only three years.</P>
      <P>However, workers are required to leave Taiwan for 40 days after
their three-year contracts expire and come back to work under a new
three-year contract. The move is designed to prevent them from
applying for immigration.</P>
      <P>The amendment forbids employers from discriminating against
foreign employees on the ground of their marital status.</P>
      <P>Employers are also banned from employing foreign workers who have
come to Taiwan to work for other employers. Offenders are liable to
fines between NT$150,000 to NT$750,000 for the first offense. Jail
terms of up to three years and fines of up to NT$1.2 million will be
handed down to offenders for second offenses.</P>
      <P>The amendment states that when recruiting new foreign workers,
employers should not keep the identity cards, work permits and other
documents of the applicants without their consent. They are also not
allowed to ask the workers to engage in illegal work.</P>
      <P>At present, employers are required to put deposits equivalent to
two months' wages for a foreign worker at the Council for Labor
Affairs. The amendment abolishes this requirement.</P>
      <P>The Employment Services Act was first promulgated in 1992.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC V.P. ATTENDS INAUGURATION OF GAMBIAN PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Banjul,  Gambia,  Dec.  21 (CNA)
(By M. J. Tzou and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Vice President
Annette Lu, on behalf of President Chen Shui-bian, attended the
inauguration of reelected Gambian President Yahya Jammeh Friday held
at an open-air gymnasium in the Gambian capital of Banjul.</P>
      <P>More than 20,000 people attended the inauguration, including
several heads of state from neighboring African countries and many
special envoys from other countries.</P>
      <P>In his inaugural speech, Jammeh vowed to continue to promote
constitutional democracy in Gambia, manage the nation based on the
principles of justice, transparency and humanitarianism, and lead
Gambia to become a modernized nation that respects the rule of law,
religious freedom and human rights.</P>
      <P>Jammeh at the ceremony also announced an amnesty for former
President Dauda Jawara, who is now living in self-exile in Britain
after his government was toppled in the early 1990s, allowing the
former ruler to return to his home country freely. Jammeh's
announcement was met with thunderous applause.</P>
      <P>President Chen offered his personal felicitations to Jammeh on
Oct. 22 upon the reelection of the Gambian Presdient, who garnered an
overwhelming 52.96 percent of the vote in the country's November
presidential election.</P>
      <P>Political observers from the United States, Canada and Europe
witnessed the presidential election, which was held in two rounds of
voting, and judged it to be a fair election that was "transparent and
clean."</P>
      <P>Jammeh staged a coup as a military officer in 1994, overthrowing
the corrupt Gambian regime of the time. He then ran in the 1997
presidential race in his capacity as a civilian and was elected with
a large mandate from the voters.</P>
      <P>To mark Jammeh's reelection and the unique way of voting in
Gambia, namely the use of marbles as ballots, Lu presented Jammeh
with a box of 1.5 million marbles as a gift. Lu said that Gambia's
use of marbles to vote reflects "fairness and transparency" as well
as democratic ways which she said should be emulated by other African
countries.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lu said she will not visit Senegal after her three-day
visit in Gambia as she is scheduled to head back to Taiwan where
President Chen is waiting for her for other official business.</P>
      <P>Lu said she hopes to visit Senegal as soon as possible and
dismissed rumors that there might be changes in the formal diplomatic
relationship between the Republic of China and Senegal.</P>
      <P>Lu, at the head of a special ROC diplomatic delegation, flew via
Paris into Gambia Thursday, receiving a red-carpet welcome by the
Gambian government upon arrival.</P>
      <P>She and her entourage, which includes Vice Foreign Affairs
Minister Chiu Jong-nan, are scheduled to leave Gambia Saturday for
Taiwan, making a one-day stopover in Vienna and a transit stop at the
Paris international airport enroute.</P>

      <P>Thirteen-year-old Taiwanese golfer Tseng
Ya-ni won the girls' division of the Singapore Island Country Club
Junior Championships on Friday with a score of 228 over three rounds,
five strokes ahead of the second-place finisher from Thailand.</P>
      <P>An up-and-coming handicap eight player who won this year's Asia
Pacific Junior Championships for her age group and who placed fifth
at the San Diego Junior World Championships, Tseng carded a final-day
score of five-over-par 77 and a 12-over-par overall score to win the
title in the Girls' B Division for players aged 11 to 13.</P>
      <P>On the par-five 11th hole in the opening round, Tseng delivered a
260-meter drive -- a respectable distance for a player in her age
group, considering that she stands at only 162 centimeters tall and
weighs 54 kilograms.</P>
      <P>Tseng also wowed the crowd in the opening round by hitting a
one-under-par 71 on the hilly golf course to lead the entire field of
150 men and women players at the Singapore Island Country Club
invitational tournament by nine strokes.</P>
      <P>However, a triple bogey on the sixth hole on her second day --
plus three birdies, four bogeys and two double bogeys -- set her back
at 80 strokes for a two-round total of seven-over-par 151.</P>
      <P>Tournament organizers at the San Diego Junior World Championships
compared her swing to that of Tiger Woods, noting that the two share
a similar style.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The public is most satisfied with President
Chen Shui-bian's dynamism and his crusade to eliminate criminal
interests in politics and least satisfied with his performance on
economic issues, according to an opinion poll released Saturday.</P>
      <P>The telephone survey, conducted by Shih Hsin University on adults
aged 20 or over and residing in one of the 23 cities and counties in
the Taiwan area, sought to measure how the public rates Chen's first
one-and-a-half years in office as well as the popularity of various
Cabinet officials.</P>
      <P>It was the fourth in a series of surveys by the university that
includes opinion polls taken after Chen's first 100 days in office,
after the conclusion of the Fourth Nuclear Power Plant incident that
ended in an embarrassing about-face after the Cabinet's unilateral
policy decision to scrap the project without first consulting the
Legislative Yuan, and after the president's first year in office.</P>
      <P>Of the 1,078 respondents in the most recent poll, 43.79 percent
said that they are satisfied or very satisfied with Chen's on-the-job
performance, indicating a gradual increase in his approval rating
after hitting its lowest point at 32.8 percent following the Fourth
Nuclear Power Plant incident which ended February this year.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 46.48 percent of the respondents said that they are
dissatisfied or very dissatisfied with the president's performance,
citing the lack of concrete achievements and his failure to make good
on certain campaign promises.</P>
      <P>On a scale of zero to 100, with 100 being the best possible
score, the respondents gave Chen an average of 63.41 points for his
perceived performance.</P>
      <P>The respondents gave Vice President Annette Lu a score of 58.46.
Only 28.91 percent of the respondents said that they are satisfied or
very satisfied with Lu's performance, while 44.35 percent of those
polled said that they are dissatisfied or very dissatisfied with her
performance.</P>
      <P>Compared to the previous administration, 40.17 percent of the
respondents said that they believe the current administration's
performance is worse. Only 27.36 percent said that they think Chen's
administration has been performing better than the previous
administration.</P>
      <P>The survey also noted that 82.96 percent of the respondents who
said that they are members of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
and 86.66 percent of those who are members of the Taiwan Solidarity
Union expressed approval for Chen's performance, while only 18.81
percent of the respondents who are opposition Kuomintang members and
14.07 percent of those who are opposition People First Party members
expressed approval.</P>
      <P>None of the respondents who are opposition New Party members said

    <HEADLINE>LAWYER FOR CANADIAN FALUN GONG EXPLAINS LAWSUIT AGAINST DAILY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  Dec.  21  (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Civil rights lawyer Rocco Galati said
Friday that Canadian Falun Gong practitioners had been "very patient"
before suing the Sing Tao Daily newspaper for libel, slander,
negligence and incitement of hatred.</P>
      <P>More than 150 Falun Gong practitioners filed a lawsuit Dec. 19 at
the Province of Ontario's Supreme Court against the mass-circulation
Chinese-language newspaper.</P>
      <P>The main piece of evidence the plaintiffs presented to the court
was a full-page spread from the Sept. 20 edition of the Sing Tao
Daily entitled "Radical Religious Advocate Destroying the World."</P>
      <P>The page carried photographs and commentary placing Falun Gong
alongside such reportedly violent and doomsday religious cults as
that of Aum Shinrikyo which released poison gas in a Tokyo subway
several years ago, as well as comparing it to the terrorists who
carried out the Sept. 11 attacks in the United States.</P>
      <P>Shortly after the printing of the articles and photos, Falun Gong
practitioners sent two separate letters to the Sing Tao Daily to
complain about the slanderous reports. They later hired Galati to
send another letter in October, but they said the daily failed on
each occasion to respond satisfactorily.</P>
      <P>As Canadian law regarding slander allows only a period of three
months for the filing of a lawsuit from the date of the alleged
infraction, the practitioners decided to file their suit Dec. 19, one
day before the deadline in this case.</P>
      <P>Galati told the press in Toronto Friday that the practitioners
had been very patient and had given the Sing Tao Daily every
opportunity to resolve the issue prior to filing the suit.</P>
      <P>The Statement of Claim filed with the court states that the
daily, "in publishing the expose, did engage in inciting hatred
against an identifiable religious (spiritual) group which is contrary
to the Criminal Code of Canada," and that the defendants "are parties
and coconspirators in these hate crimes and crimes against humanity
for which civil liabilities arise."</P>
      <P>The 156 plaintiffs, including three from Hong Kong who had a
photo of them meditating carried on the controversial page admitted
as evidence, are each demanding general damage amounting to C$50,000,
punitive damages amounting to C$20,000, a published front-page
apology and retraction, and an injunction restraining the defendants
from publishing any article about Falun Gong except the said apology.</P>
      <P>Falun Gong was very popular in mainland China before 1999 when
the Communist regime banned the movement and launched an all-out
propaganda campaign and persecution against the spiritual and health
movement allegedly due to fears that the number of practitioners had
grown to outnumber the number of Chinese Communist Party (CCP)
members.</P>
      <P>Galati said Falun Gong is practiced in at least 53 countries
around the world and that "only in China is it being targeted with
persecution and propaganda."</P>
      <P>"The entire world has condemned this persecution. The U.S.
Congress and the European Parliament have passed resolutions
(condemning the persecution). For the Sing Tao to stand on the side
of this persecution is unacceptable," he added.</P>
      <P>The filing of the lawsuit in Toronto came only nine days after
the Superior Court of Quebec issued a court order that Les Presses
Chinoises, a Chinese-language newspaper in Montreal, immediately stop
publishing and circulating articles slanderous to Falun Gong.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SCHOLARS NOTE POLARIZED RESULTS OF SURVEY ON PRESIDENT'S PERFORMANCE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 22 (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Local scholars said Saturday that a recent
survey on President Chen Shui-bian's popularity indicates that public
opinion is polarized along the lines of geography, party affiliation
and ethnic background.</P>
      <P>The telephone survey, conducted by Shih Hsin University on adults
aged 20 or over and residing in one of the 23 cities and counties in
the Taiwan area, sought to measure how the public rates Chen's first
one-and-a-half years in office as well as the popularity of various
Cabinet officials.</P>
      <P>Soochow University political science professor Sheng Chih-jen
said at a seminar that he is concerned by signs that the public's
degree of support for Chen does not fluctuate with administrative
successes or setbacks but rather remains divided over northern
Taiwan-versus-southern Taiwan, pan-blue opposition-versus-pan-green
parties, and Taiwan-born-versus-mainland-born differences.</P>
      <P>Sheng added that the public appears to go by personal preferences
instead of actual policy evaluations when rallying behind political
figures, citing as an example the fact that Minister of the Interior
Chang Po-ya received a relatively high popularity score of 64.86 on a
zero-to-100 scale even as the survey respondents said they have the
least understanding of her ministry's policies.</P>
      <P>Similarly, Wu Tung-yeh, director of the American and European
Institute at the National Chengchi University's Institute of
International Relations, said that although the survey respondents
expressed dissatisfaction with the president's and the Cabinet's
economic performance, this attitude was not reflected in the outcome
of the Dec. 1 legislative, county chief and mayoral elections that
made Chen's party the largest party in the Legislative Yuan for the
first time.</P>
      <P>Tunghai University political science professor Fu Heng-teh said
that the public's disapproval of Chen's economic performance
indicates the need for a new Cabinet that is strong in financial and
economic expertise.</P>
      <P>Of the 1,078 survey respondents, 43.79 percent said that they are
satisfied or very satisfied with Chen's on-the-job performance, while
46.48 percent said that they are dissatisfied or very dissatisfied,
citing Chen's lack of concrete achievements and his failure to make

      <P>According to the survey, the public is most satisfied with Chen's

    <HEADLINE>WORKPLACE EQUALITY LAW A HARD FOUGHT VICTORY FOR WOMEN'S RIGHTS (I)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 22 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>"The legislation has finally arrived," said
lawyer You Mei-nu after the president of the Legislative Yuan struck
his mallet Friday confirming the passage of the Workplace Gender
Equality Bill upon the third reading.</P>
      <P>"It has been much harder than having a baby," said You, who was
one of the several young but determined women attorneys-at-law who
more than 10 years ago began to fight for working women's rights. You
is now middle-aged and has a couple of children.</P>
      <P>Since 1990, women's activist organizations and other lobbying
groups have dedicated much effort toward promoting gender equality in
the workplace on the grounds that despite the fact that 45 percent of
females in Taiwan are employed, women in Taiwan still face
work-related inequalities.</P>
      <P>The public hearing for the first version of the bill, authored by
four women lawyers, namely You Mei-nu, Tu Hsiu-jui, Chen Mei-ling and
Pan Cheng-fen, was held at the Legislative Yuan in March 1989.</P>
      <P>You, who with her friends grouped together to form the women's
organization Awakening Foundation, said the passage of the new bill
is a hard fought victory following the relentless efforts of many
people over the past 13 years.</P>
      <P>Foundation members were furious over Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall's
mass dismissal in August 1987 of 57 female employees who were either
over 30 years old or pregnant, an incident prompting the group of
women lawyers to author a draft bill of equal opportunities and
rights in October of the same year.</P>
      <P>Over the past 12 years, although different versions of the draft
by authorities and the private sector were discussed by the Executive
Yuan, no concrete progress was made until recently.</P>
      <P>To strengthen their appeal, members of Taipei women's
organizations jointly launched a hell-raising demonstration in 1996
by marching hand-in-hand toward the Presidential Office, with female
sanitary pads stuck to their heads. The marching "Kotex protesters"
nearly scared to death the male police forces guarding the office.</P>
      <P>According to You, Chen Shui-bian, then a lawyer-turned-legislator
from the Democratic Progressive Party, contacted the women's
organizations and offered his idea that an anti sexual harassment
article be included in the bill, and it was.</P>
      <P>The new law states that employees should be treated equally in
terms of salary, promotions and assignments. It also requires
employers to take measures to eliminate sexual harassment in the
workplace.</P>
      <P>With the implementation of the new law, an employee, whether male
or female, who has worked for an establishment with 30 employees or
more for at least one year may request an unpaid leave of up to two
years before his or her child turns three years old in order to take
care of the child.</P>
      <P>Employees with children under the age of three may also request a
reduction in their work hours of up to one hour per day or
adjustments to their work schedule, according to the law.

    <HEADLINE>WORKPLACE EQUALITY (II)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 22 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Lai You-mei, chairwoman of the Awakening Foundation, welcomed the
passage of the law, but added that the "challenges are just
beginning."</P>
      <P>The arrival of the law is just a reflection of the constitutional
protection of equal rights. How to enable employers and employees to
understand the power of the law and how to have it fully materialized
are big challenges, Lai pointed out.</P>
      <P>While applauding the passage of the bill into law, women's
activist organizations said they think there are still some flaws,
namely that only employees of establishments with 30 employees or
more are qualified to request unpaid leave to care for their children
under the age of 3 -- a regulation preventing many young parents who
work for smaller enterprises from enjoying the same right.</P>
      <P>Also, the women's activists said the law, scheduled to take
effect March 8, 2002, does not provide a sufficient channel of
complaint to those who feel they have been discriminated against nor
does it provide for a proper supervisory mechanism to deal with those
who fail to observe the law.</P>
      <P>Last year, 841,000 women in Taiwan quit their jobs because of
giving birth, according to a survey compiled by the Directorate
General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS).</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, about one out of every five mothers quits work after
giving birth for the first time.</P>
      <P>The DGBAS also found that 50.3 percent of new mothers resumed
their jobs after giving birth in 2000, marking the highest such
percentage in recent years. It takes mothers an average of six years
to return to the work place after giving birth, according to the
survey.</P>
      <P>The new law was met with mixed reactions from the industrial and
business sector. Some corporate owners said that from now on, they
will view male employees as more favorable than female ones as the
new law will raise their overhead costs for employing females.</P>
      <P>A woman clerk at a local bank surnamed Chen said she is worried
that the new law allowing her to take up to two years' of leave to
care for a child may lead to her being put at the top of a layoff
list against a backdrop of the growing number of mergers and layoffs
among banks.</P>
      <P>"The chances are that when I returned to the bank after two
years, I would find that I had been replaced," she noted.</P>
      <P>Fortunately, some corporations in Taiwan have benefits that are
better than those provided for in the new law.</P>
      <P>Accton Technology, whose headquarters is located in the Hsinchu
Science-based Industrial Park, has been known for its good treatment
of female employees.</P>
      <P>With the corporate motto of "we provide not just better benefits,
we also provide stability, care and challenges," Accton is one of the
very few companies in Taiwan that offers a NT$3,000 salary raise for
employees who get married and also has two daycare centers located in
the company to give employees peace of mind while working.</P>
      <P>All female Accton employees are also entitled to a 10-month
maternity leave each time they give birth, with the company paying 70
percent of the monthly salary during the leave.</P>
      <P>Chang Kung Memorial Hospital in Kaohsiung, financed by the
Formosa Plastics Group, is another example. The hospital has
established a daycare center which is open to all the hospital's
workers. Employees with children between one month old and six years
old can bring their children to the center during their work time.</P>
      <P>Taiwan IMB has for a long time allowed its female employees to
take unpaid one-year maternity leaves, with the option of extending
the period of leave to two years upon request.</P>
      <P>HP Taiwan, meanwhile, allows its female employees to adjust their
work schedules to cope with the demands of motherhood.</P>

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian offered his
condolences in person Saturday to the family of the late famed writer
Lin Hai-yin, who died of illness in hospital Dec. 1 at the age of 83.</P>
      <P>A memorial service was held at the Taiwan Cement Building
Saturday morning with dozens of big names from Taiwan's literary
circles attending to commerorate Lin, a writer-editor-publisher. The
living room of Lin and her husband had been known as a "rendezvous
point which most of time housed half of Taiwan's literary elite."</P>
      <P>English literature professor Chi Pang-yuan, one of Lin's best
friends, said during the service that Lin, with her natural talent
and inherent good nature, was the luckiest and most blessed person
she has ever known. Chi translated Lin's masterpieces, including the
short stories "Memory of Peking" and "Gold Carp's Pleated Skirt" into
English for publication in the United States.</P>
      <P>"Memory of Peking," a story about life in Peking through the eyes
of a young woman -- Lin herself -- was made into a movie by the
Shanghai Motion Picture Co. in 1982.</P>
      <P>Lin was born in the Japanese city of Osaka to a Taiwanese-Hakka
father and a Taipei mother. She moved to Beijing with her parents
during her formative years and lived there until the age of 25.</P>
      <P>Lin and her writer husband Hsia Cheng-ying (who later became
famous as the columnist Ho Fan) moved to Taiwan from Beijing in 1950
and opened the Pure Literature Publishing House, which discovered and
nurtured many up-and-coming writers who later gained fame in Taiwan's

    <HEADLINE>DERAILMENT MARS REOPENING AND CELEBRATIONS FOR ALISHAN LINE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 23 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A train derailed early Sunday on a section
of the Alishan forest railway which had just been reopened after a
three-month closure to repair damage caused by Typhoon Nari in
September. Eight passengers were slightly injured in the incident.</P>
      <P>The railway, which makes a steep climb up Ali Mountain and is
popular with tourists, had resumed operations only the day before.</P>
      <P>Chung Shui-lin, chief of the Chiayi forest administration, which
operates the railway, said the derailment took place on a side route
from the Alishan main railway station to Chushan.</P>
      <P>About 400 passengers had boarded the train that left at 5:20 a.m.
to make the journey to Chushan to view the sunrise. Part of the train
left the tracks about 10 minutes after it pulled away from the
station.</P>
      <P>Passengers said they heard a loud grating sound as the train came
to an abrupt stop. The first three carriages were left tilted at a
nearly 45-degree angle. Passengers fearing that the entire train
would come off the tracks jumped from some of the carriages.</P>
      <P>After the incident, some of the passengers braved the cold --
minus 1.9 Celsius -- and continued to Chushan on foot; the others
were taken back to Alishan by an eight-car service train which
arrived about half-an-hour later, Chung said.</P>
      <P>The injured passengers were treated in an Alishan clinic.</P>
      <P>Three trains normally make morning runs on every holiday to
Chushan. The train that derailed was the first run Sunday and the two
other trains were canceled after the accident.</P>
      <P>The disruption of railway services since the summer typhoon has
dealt a serious blow to the economies of numerous hotels and
restaurants on Alishan, a famous mountain resort.</P>
      <P>The Chiayi forest administration had hoped to resume services on
the 71.4 kilometer railway Saturday to coincide with the 90th
anniversary of the railway's opening, but a collapse of the bed of a
section Dec. 12 ended the possibility that the entire line could be
reopened as planned.</P>
      <P>However, a celebration marking the anniversary was held Saturday
and services were resumed for the short run from Chiayi to Fenchi
Lake.</P>
      <P>The Chiayi forest administration brought out a 76-year-old steam
locomotive to shuttle passengers for free on refurbished carriages
between Peimen Station in Chiayi, the start of the route, and the
next station of Chuchi as part of the celebration.</P>
      <P>Passengers, nostalgic for the time when the puffing train was the
only way to get to the top of Alishan, except by hiking, scrambled to
take pictures of the vintage locomotive which, if pressed into
service, could still make the trip up the 2,200 meter Alishan.</P>
      <P>The refurbished and colorful train has only 10 seats in each
carriage and comes equipped with karaoke facilities and
closed-circuit television. Passengers wishing to make the full trip
to Alishan -- with a modern locomotive -- pay around NT$1,000 one
way.</P>
      <P>A series of other celebration activities were held to mark the
resumption of the forest railway service and the 90th anniversary of
the railway's inauguration Saturday.</P>
      <P>Council of Agriculture Secretary-General Huang Chin-jung and
other central and local government officials attended the celebration
activities.</P>
      <P>The celebration drew some 3,000 visitors to Alishan, which has
seen visitor numbers dwindle since the destructive typhoon last
summer.</P>
      <P>Alishan is the most famous scenic area close to Yushan National
Park. Scenic areas there include Wufeng Memorial Park, Fenchi Lake
and Juili. From these places, tourists can view the sunrise -- a sea
of clouds -- monkey-shaped stones and old-growth trees.</P>

    <HEADLINE>OPPOSITION LEGISLATOR VOWS TO CUT 'UNREASONABLE ITEMS ' FROM BUDGET</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  23 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Proposed cuts in the Central Government's
annual budget for next year are not deep enough and the People First
Party (PFP) will have no reservation about cutting "unreasonable
items," a PFP legislator said Sunday.</P>
      <P>PFP legislator Liu Wen-hsiung said the overall review has focused
on budgets for various government agencies, which account for between
75 percent and 80 percent of the total annual budget, which amounts
to about NT$1.2 trillion (US$34.48 billion).</P>
      <P>Liu said that listening to discussions over the last several
weeks, he is concerned that the various agencies are not prepared to
cut enough from their proposed budgets. Aside from the possibility
that certain parts of the proposals may not conform to the law or
that sections could overlap between agencies, the budgets are still
too fat, he said.</P>
      <P>The proposed cuts are between 0.2 percent and 0.5 percent,
smaller than previous budget cuts over the past 10 years.</P>
      <P>Liu said the average ratio of cuts in budgets was around 1.8
percent over the past 10 years, adding that the lowest rate was still
0.93 percent for the 2000 budget. This was the year after the
disastrous earthquake on Sept. 21, 1999 which claimed 2,400 lives and
caused widespread damage, particularly in central Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In comparison, he noted that the proposed ratio of budget cuts in
12 committees screening the budgets this month has been between 0.2
percent and 0.5 percent, which is a significant drop from past cuts.</P>
      <P>Liu said since the job market and economic growth rate in Taiwan
next year are not expected to be good, if the budget cuts are so
small then the financial situation can only worsen, particularly
given that next year might be a lean year for government revenue.</P>
      <P>He said if the trend continues, the result may be an incompetent
opposition and an arrogant ruling party, and the people will be the
ones to suffer.</P>
      <P>He also said that the PFP, mandated by the people to monitor the
government's expenditures, will cut "unreasonable items" from the
budget after consultations with the ruling party.</P>
      <P>Tsai Huang-liang, DPP party whip in the legislature, said that
the ruling party will consult with the opposition parties in floor
meetings, adding that the review of the budget should be pragmatic,
and that one should not dogmatically follow the ratio of budget cuts
in previous years as the benchmark for the upcoming year.</P>
      <P>Noting that this is the first time that legislators have reviewed
a budget after legislative elections, Tsai said they seem "listless"
in reviewing the budget. He said that the legislators should show
self-discipline and do their utmost to carefully review the budget.</P>

      <P>The outgoing chief of the Government
Information Office's representative office in Hong Kong said she sees
no big problem for continued cross-strait cooperation, although it
will be more difficult for both sides to engage in political
dialogues.</P>
      <P>Chiang Su-hui, director of the Kwang Hwa Information and Cultural
Center in Hong Kong, made the remarks when she was interviewed on
cable TV in the former British colony Saturday.</P>
      <P>Chiang said that she was optimistic about economic exchanges
between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, noting that a lot of
Taiwan businessmen have traveled to the mainland and that economic
exchanges and cooperation will not be affected.</P>
      <P>But she also said that the situation of Taiwan and Hong Kong is
different, and that the "one country, two systems" formula will not
apply to Taiwan, stressing that Beijing doesn't have to apply that
formula for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>She also said that mainland officials often take a tough stance
in addressing issues concerning Taiwan, further alienating Taiwan
people.</P>
      <P>On the political dialogues, Chiang said that unless Taiwan
accepts the "one China" principle cherished by the mainland, it will
be difficult for both sides to engage in political dialogue.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FORMER ROC PRESIDENT'S VISIT TO JAPAN SAID A HEADACHE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Tokyo,  Dec.  23  (CNA)
(By Mike Chang and Ed Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Republic of China President Lee
Teng-hui's visit to Japan was a headache for the Japanese government,
the Nihon Keizai newspaper quoted Foreign Minister Yukiko Tanaka as
saying Sunday.</P>
      <P>Nihon Keizai quoted pro-Beijing Foreign Minister Tanaka as
reporting that Lee was indeed in need of regular medical attentions,
and he still had some political influence -- although diminished --
but his visit to Japan was still something of a headache.</P>
      <P>Tanaka spoke by telephone with Chinese Foreign Minister Tang
Jiaxuan last May shortly after she assumed the foreign minister post
and told him that Japan would not grant a visa for the former ROC
president if he applies again.</P>
      <P>Tanaka is the daughter of former Japan Prime Minister Kakuei
Tanaka who established diplomatic relations with Beijing in 1972.</P>
      <P>Yukiko's public remarks have drawn fierce criticism from the
ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and the public.</P>
      <P>Prime Minister Junichiro Kozumi said that Japan issued a visa for
the former ROC president completely based on the independent judgment
of the nation's interests, adding that the issue was discussed during
the interpellation session of the parliament on May 9.</P>
      <P>If the former ROC president applies for a visa again, the
government's decision will be made after comprehensive consideration,
Kozumi said.</P>
      <P>However, an official from the Japanese Ministry of Foreign
Affairs said Lee's visit to Japan was for medical treatment and if he
wishes to apply again for the same purpose, Japan has no reason to
refuse his visa application.</P>
      <P>Former Japanese Foreign Minister Yohei Kono was against granting
the former ROC president another visa so as not to offend Beijing.
Under pressure from politicians and the media, former Japanese Prime
Minister Yoshiro Mori eventually granted a visa for the former ROC
head of state in April.</P>
      <P>Diplomatic sources said said that as Lee is now a civilian like
the general public, and it would be difficult for Japan to deny him a
visa.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SMUGGLERS OF AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS COULD FACE HEAVIER PENALTIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Dec.  24  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Those caught smuggling agricultural
products into or out of Taiwan could face stiffer penalties in the
future if an amendment approved Monday by the Legislative Yuan's
Judicial Committee is passed into law.</P>
      <P>The judicial committee approved an amendment to the Smuggling
Control and Elimination Act compiled by the Executive Yuan to
increase the maximum fine on agricultural product smugglers from the
current level of NT$150,000 (US$4,348) to NT$3 million (US$87,000)
and raise the maximum prison sentence from the present three years to
five years.</P>
      <P>The approved amendment, aimed at protecting Taiwan's agricultural
sector, would also increase the maximum fine for repeat offenders
from the current level of NT$300,000 (US$8,700) to NT$7 million
(US$203,000) if passed into law.</P>
      <P>The amendment also changes the wording of the current law from
"convicted violators could also be fined in addition to receiving
prison terms" to "imprisonment and fines for convicted violators."</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan recommended the amendment in a move to
substantiate the conclusions reached in consensus by the presidential
Economic Development Advisory Conference (EDAC) held in August to
prevent smuggling from further undermining Taiwan's agricultural
sector and its development.</P>
      <P>The EDAC resolved that the punishment for agricultural product
smugglers should be heavier in order to deter future smuggling,
protect Taiwan's agricultural production and its marketing order, and
protect farmers' interests.</P>
      <P>The advisory conference also concluded that more severe penalties
are needed to protect quarantine control of domestic animal and plant
species, as well as Taiwan's overall economic development.</P>
      <P>Legislator Tsai Huang-lang from the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party said passage of the amendment is imperative as smuggling of
agricultural products, particularly from mainland China to Taiwan,
has been increasing over recent years with the further liberalization
of private cross-strait exchanges.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN'S JOBLESS RATE MAKES FIRST FALL IN 13 MONTHS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 24 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's jobless rate in November was 5.28
percent, slightly down from the record 5.33 percent of the previous
month, the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics
(DGBAS) said Monday.</P>
      <P>The figure marks the first decline in 13 months since October
2000, though it is hardly a harbinger of economic rebound, DGBAS
official Chen Chin-cheng said, adding that the jobless rate for next
month will still be between 5.2 percent and 5.3 percent.</P>
      <P>Chen said that job losses because of factory closures or
downsizing increased to a record high of 268,000 for the 15th
consecutive month, up 8,000 from the previous month, and that
declines continue in the manufacturing industry.</P>
      <P>But with Chinese New Year approaching, which falls on Feb. 12,
2002, the food service industry will see brisker business and the
openings of several big shopping malls, as well as the harvesting
season of certain agricultural products, will help the jobless
situation, Chen said.</P>
      <P>He said that overall, employment should rise before Chinese New
Year, helping to stabilize the jobless rate. However, with Taiwan's
entry into the World Trade Organization in January, 2002, it will not
be possible to assess the true impact until March 2002, he said.</P>
      <P>He said that the average jobless rate in the first 11 months was
4.52 percent and the jobless rate this year will be 4.57 percent.</P>
      <P>Though the jobless rate in Taiwan showed an overall decline, 18
cities and counties have still registered a jobless rate of over 5
percent, with Hualien County the highest at 5.69 percent, followed by
Taipei County (5.68 percent), and Taichung County (5.66 percent).</P>
      <P>Legislator Lai Shyi-bao, in commenting on the first jobless
decline in 13 months, said that the jobless rate could still be
higher than 5 percent in the short term.</P>
      <P>He cautioned against optimism over the decline, saying that
judging from the domestic and international situations, it is still
too early to say that it means the economy has hit bottom.</P>
      <P>He noted that the overall international situation has yet to turn
the corner to recovery, and when the economy of the United States
will rebound remains to be seen. So, with domestic leading economic
indexes showing no remarkable improvement, Lai said he could not say
when the economy will bottom out.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FEAR OF LOSING JOBS MOST CONCERNS TAIWAN PEOPLE: SURVEY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  24  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Fear of losing their jobs most concerns
residents of Taiwan and 85 percent said that finding a job has become
difficult, according to a resent survey released Monday.</P>
      <P>The poll, conducted by the mass-circulation newspaper United
Daily News, telephoned 938 adults around the island Dec. 18-19. The
survey had a margin of error of 3.2 percent.</P>
      <P>The poll also found that nearly 89 percent of respondents
complained about the economic sluggishness, and 49 percent said that
they felt the pinch of hard times. Sixty-four percent complained that
their lives are not what they used to be.</P>
      <P>According to the survey, 1995 was a turning point for local
people in terms of their feelings toward the nation's economy. In
1994, only 46 percent felt that the economy was bad and 34 percent
said that finding a job was difficult.</P>
      <P>In comparison, complaints about the economy have averaged around
76 percent since 1995 and hit a peak of 94 percent in 2000. A survey
this year showed that nearly 89 percent of respondents said they felt
the economy was in bad shape. Only 7 percent said that the economy is
still doing well.</P>
      <P>With the stalled economy, the impact on the lives of the average
person has continued to become more evident. The figure for those
satisfied with their lives hovered near 63 percent between 1996 and
1999, but dropped to 54 percent last year and slipped further to 48
percent this year.</P>
      <P>Most of these polled were also pessimistic about their futures.
Thirty-four percent believed that daily life over the next two or
three years will be worse than now. Only 27 percent expected the
future to be better.</P>
      <P>Regarding employment, 31 percent of the 61 percent who are
currently employed said that they are worried about the possibility
of losing their jobs because of the poor economy. Thirty-four percent
said that Taiwan's entry into the World Trade Organization could
affect their jobs or incomes.</P>
      <P>But 64 percent say that the success or failure of a person is up
to the individual and 30 percent said that timing is more important
than effort.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CROSS-STRAIT CRIMES CHALLENGING TAIWAN'S LAW ENFORCEMENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 24 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Organized crime across the Taiwan Strait is
becoming rampant and presents a formidable challenge to Taiwan's law
enforcement, said Meng Wei-teh, an associate professor in public
administration from the National Central Police University.</P>
      <P>Cross-strait crimes are now seriously disturbing Taiwan's social
order, hampering the island's economic development and posing a
serious threat to Taiwan people's quality of life, personal safety
and property, Meng said.</P>
      <P>Meng said Taiwan and mainland China are separated only by a
"ditch." He said that because the people from both sides are from the
same race with almost identical languages and customs, crimes of all
kinds can easily bridge the distance between the two. Meng mentioned
crimes like goods' smuggling, drug trafficking, the sale of illegal
weapons, smuggling of human cargo and hijacking.</P>
      <P>Quoting tallies from the Criminal Investigation Bureau, Meng said
the number of criminals who fled Taiwan to mainland China has risen
yearly over last 10 years.</P>
      <P>During that time, Taiwan law enforcement authorities have
requested cooperation from mainland Chinese authorities to attempt to
jointly apprehend 335 criminals wanted in Taiwan. Of that total, only
87 were caught while the remaining 74 percent remain fugitives, Meng
said.</P>
      <P>According to the Criminal Investigation Bureau, those Taiwan
criminals, most of them prominent gangland figures, were found to
have "remotely controlled" their cross-strait operations, including
drug and weapons trafficking, smuggling of laborers and prostitutes
from mainland China and shipping stolen cars from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Between Jan. 1 and Oct. 31 this year, 3,647 mainland Chinese
people were nabbed by Taiwan law enforcement authorities for
violating ROC laws.</P>
      <P>Of the total, 1,150 mainlanders, or 31.5 percent, were arrested
or repatriated for illegally working in Taiwan, 953 mainland women,
or 26.1 percent, were apprehended while working in the sex trade, and
866 people, or 23.8 percent, were found to be illegal immigrants from
mainland China.</P>
      <P>Taiwan police have found that 47.8 percent, or 50.8 kilograms of
the 106.4 kilograms of heroin confiscated in 1999, originated from
mainland China, and 68 percent of the 1,214.5 kilograms of
amphetamines seized the same year were from across the Taiwan Strait.</P>

    <HEADLINE>RESEARCH REPORT SAYS KAOHSIUNG NEEDS TO PROSPER ITS SERVICE SECTOR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  24  (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Kaohsiung has the potential to become an
international city given its good resources for agricultural,
industrial and business developments, but only as long as the public
and private sectors can improve the service sector, according to a
research report.</P>
      <P>The Council for Economic Planning and Development recently
entrusted the Chungshan Business Management Academic Research Society
to prepare a report on urban development in metropolitan Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>The report indicated that Kaohsiung as a harbor city has the
advantages in developing itself into a deep-sea fishery base. On the
other hand, with the Linyuan petrochemical industrial zone and the
steel mills of the China Steel Corp. in neighboring regions,
Kaohsiung is an important industrial city in Taiwan and in Southeast
Asia.</P>
      <P>For further modernization and internationalization, the
metropolis with 1.47 million people needs to boost its service
sector, according to the report.</P>
      <P>The report says that employees of the service sector accounted
for 62.98 percent of the employed population in Kaohsiung in 1996.
The percentage increased moderately to 65.44 percent in 1999. To
compare with Taipei, Hong Kong and Singapore, Kaohsiung's service
sector is less developed, it added.</P>

said will make Taipei Bank the only financial institution in the
world to be in charge of a charity lottery where the majority of the
profits will be used for public interest projects.</P>
      <P>The computerized lottery numbers will be drawn twice a week. The
top prize is NT$50 million (US$1.4 million) and will be rolled over
each time no one wins the lottery.</P>

      <P>Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian
visited Wuchiu Wednesday and instructed the troops garrisoned on the
tiny outlying island to remain on guard to prevent mainland Chinese
infiltration.</P>
      <P>Accompanied by Minister of National Defense Wu Shih-wen and Chief
of the General Staff Gen. Tang Yao-ming, Chen was the first ROC
president ever to visit Wuchiu during his term in office.</P>
      <P>The president said that Wuchiu is strategically located between
Kinmen and Matsu in the Taiwan Strait and serves as a forward post in
the defense of Taiwan that can provide early warning on incoming
aircraft.</P>
      <P>Instructing the officers and soldiers stationed on the island to
heighten their awareness and step up their combat readiness, Chen
warned that mainland China has continued to refuse to renounce the
option to use force against Taiwan and has diverted the results of
its economic development into its military modernization efforts,
allowing for large-scale advances in its overall fighting prowess.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIPEI PROTESTS JAPANESE MINISTERS' REMARKS ON TAIWAN SOVEREIGNTY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  26 (CNA)
(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China Ministry of Foreign
Affairs (MOFA) Wednesday lodged a protest against the remarks of two
Japanese cabinet ministers regarding Taiwan's sovereignty.</P>
      <P>Japanese Foreign Minister Makiko Tanaka said in an interview with
a Japanese daily Dec. 25 that, "In the future, Taiwan is going to be
returned to China, like Hong Kong."</P>
      <P>Later, Chief Cabinet Secretary Y. Fukuda said that the Japanese
government's position on this issue has been stipulated in the 1972
Japan-mainland China joint statement -- "Taiwan is an inalienable
part of the People's Republic of China and Japan understands and
respects such a stand."</P>
      <P>In response to the two Japanese ministers' remarks, MOFA Vice
Minister Wu Tzu-dan summoned Shintaro Yamashita, director of the
Taipei Office under the Japan Interchange Association, to the foreign
ministry to lodge a protest.</P>
      <P>Wu told Yamashita that Taiwan's situation is totally different
from that of Hong Kong and stressed that Taipei insists on resolving
cross-Taiwan Strait problems through peaceful negotiations.</P>
      <P>He went on to say that Taipei is against the so-called "one
country, two systems" formula proposed by Beijing and added that
Taiwan will continue to strive for improvement of cross-strait
relations with goodwill and sincerity.</P>
      <P>Regarding the Japanese government's stand on the Taiwan issue, Wu
said that the ROC has been an independent sovereign country since
1912.</P>
      <P>He said that Taiwan and mainland China are now two separate
political entities, pointing out the fact that the PRC's political
jurisdiction has never reached Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Wu delivered a memorandum to Yamashita, who promised to transmit
it to the Japanese government.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, ROC Representative to Japan Lo Fu-chuan also delivered
a letter of protest to the Japan Interchange Association in Tokyo.</P>
      <P>The letter noted that the Republic of China on Taiwan is an
independent sovereign country and its future will be decided by the
23 million people in Taiwan. It said that foreign officials are not
allowed to interfere.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Benevolent Association in Japan also sent letters of
protest to the prime minister's office, the foreign ministry and
major Japanese news organizations, demanding that the Japanese
foreign minister apologize to the people of Taiwan for her
inappropriate remarks.</P>

      <P>The Taiwan Independent Alliance (TIA)
Wednesday protested against comments made by Japanese Foreign
Minister Yukiko Tanaka on Taiwan's future, a senior official of the
TIA said.</P>
      <P>Huang Chao-tang, chairman of the alliance, issued a written
statement, charging that Tanaka was lacking in knowledge and common
sense about history by having said Tuesday that the future of Taiwan
will be like Hong Kong -- eventually coming under the control of
mainland China.</P>
      <P>Huang asked Tanaka to apologize to the Taiwan people since
Tanaka's comments had seriously injured the rights and dignity of the
people of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Being a foreign minister of Japan, Tanaka should bear the
political responsibility for any comment made by her regarding
another country, Huang said.</P>
      <P>Tanaka's comments are an interference in the internal affairs of
Taiwan, Huang went on, adding that this was the reason that he asked

    <HEADLINE>COL. PAN AI-CHU TO BECOME THIRD FEMALE MAJOR GENERAL IN ROC HISTORY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  4 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Col. Pan Ai-chu, the new political warfare
department director of the Military Intelligence Bureau (MIB) under
the Ministry of National Defense (MND), will be promoted to the rank
of major general Jan. 1, 2002, a spokesman from the MND announced
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Pan, 46, will be the first Republic of China female officer to be
promoted to major general in more than 40 years. She will become only
the third female general in the country's military history. The two
others were Chou Mei-yu and Chiang Yi-ying, who were promoted to
major generals in 1958 and 1967, respectively.</P>
      <P>"The promotion will be yet another symbol of gender equality in
the ROC armed forces," Pan said several days ago on hearing the news
of her promotion. She said that it also signifies the bright career
prospects for women military officers in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Pan encouraged her comrades in the military to put aside the
issue of sex and compete with their male peers on an equal footing.
As a matter of fact, she said, the military has put much emphasis on
gender equality in recent years. "I feel that female officers and
non-commissioned officers can have brilliant careers just like their
male comrades so long as they work hard," Pan said.</P>
      <P>Military records show that Pan graduated from the political
science department of the military-run Fuhsingkang College and has a
master's degree from the school's Graduate Institute of Political
Science.</P>
      <P>Pan has also attended an MIB-sponsored graduate program. Pan was
an outstanding student and ranked among the top three when she
graduated from Fuhsingkang College. She worked for two years at the
ROC Army's local-level political warfare units and then entered
graduate school.</P>
      <P>She joined the MIB's mainland affairs research department after
obtaining her master's degree. Over the past 20-plus years, Pan has
been involved in research of mainland Chinese intelligence and
relevant information. She is now responsible for studying articles
carried in major mainland Chinese magazines as well as collecting,
compiling and analyzing information about the latest situation on the
mainland.</P>
      <P>Pan has received much acclaim from the government and military
leadership for her analyses of mainland intelligence and suggestions
on the development of relations across the Taiwan Strait, military
sources said.</P>
      <P>According to MIB sources, Pan's analytical reports were very
useful during three critical periods -- the 1996 Taiwan Strait
crisis, former President Lee Teng-hui's defining of cross-strait ties
as a special "state-to-state" relationship in July 1999, and the 2000
presidential election which ushered in Taiwan's first peaceful
transition of power between different political parties.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CETRA ADJUSTS ITS OPERATIONS TO MEET NEW CHALLENGES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  27  (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The China External Trade Development
Council (Cetra) will adjust its operations by shifting its focus from
export-oriented business to diversified services in the export as
well as import sectors, CETRA chairman Shea Jia-dong said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Shea said that the trade organization needs to find a new
orientation in the face of mounting international competition.</P>
      <P>Since its founding in 1970, the Cetra has been Taiwan's largest
non-profit trade promoter. The 38 Cetra branch offices, design
centers and trade centers overseas gather trade information, conduct
market research, promote made-in-Taiwan products, organize
exhibitions, and promote product and packaging designs.</P>
      <P>In 1980, the Cetra-managed Taipei World Trade Center with
convention facilities and display grounds was set up. In addition to
leasing exhibition booths, the trade center provides venues for
dozens of industrial exhibitions every year.</P>
      <P>Shea said that in the coming year, the Cetra will seek to expand
its display facilities to meet the increasing demand from exhibitors
at home and from abroad.</P>
      <P>Another important task for the trade promotion organization is to
train more trade specialists for the government and the business
community, according to Shea.</P>
      <P>The Cetra set up the International Trade Institute in 1987 to
train trade specialists well versed in foreign languages and the
practices of international trade. The institute offers a two-year
residential post-graduate international business administration
program.</P>
      <P>Shea said that the Cetra underwent a restructuring over the past
several months and the workforce was cut by one tenth. The Cetra
hopes to reduce its operational costs by NT$200 million in 2002,
while looking for new sources of income, he added.</P>
      <P>Shea disclosed that the Cetra will set aside NT$600 million of
its capital to invest on the stock market. The former finance
minister said that as a matter of fact, the Cetra has studied the
feasibility of investing in stocks since the weighted price index of
the Taiwan Stock Exchange dwindled to 4,000 points in mid September.</P>

      <P>Amid calls for a domestic television
reform, a new alliance was formed Thursday to promote media
liberalization, professionalism and democratization as well as to rid
the media of political influences.</P>
      <P>"The establishment of the Media Development Rainbow Alliance is
aimed at boosting media impartiality, independence and balanced news
reporting," said Chang Hsien-yao, one of the new alliance's founders.</P>
      <P>Chang, who concurrently serves as director of the opposition
People First Party's (PFP's) policy research center, and PFP
Legislator Diane Lee jointly hosted a news conference explaining the
alliance's major purposes and goals.</P>
      <P>"One of the group's top goals is to invite President Chen
Shui-bian and leaders of ruling and opposition parties to jointly
sign an agreement on the ouster of political parties, government and
military from airwave channels," said Chang.</P>
      <P>He added that the alliance will also push amendments to Article
22 of the Broadcasting and Television Law and relevant provisions
through the legislature to demand that the government sell its shares
in Taiwan Television (TTV) and China Television System (CTS) to the
public.</P>
      <P>Other goals included promoting the legislation of a political
party law that would ban political parties from controlling media
management; pushing local terrestrial TV channels to trade their
shares publicly on the stock exchange; and promoting the formation
of a national media development commission.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, Legislator Diane Lee said the
alliance's name bears special symbolic meanings.</P>
      <P>"By designating our group as the Rainbow Alliance, we hope that
local media would offer multidimensional, pluralistic, ingenious,
inspiring and professional news services just like the colorfulness
of rainbow," Lee explained.</P>
      <P>The founders of the new alliance include some 20 elite members

    <HEADLINE>ADJUSTMENT OF TAX REDISTRIBUTION RATIOS YET TO BE FINALIZED: PREMIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taichung,  Taiwan,  Dec.  27  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Finance (MOF)
plan to adjust the allocation ratios of tax redistribution funds
(TRF) for various cities and counties around the island has yet to be
finalized, said Premier Chang Chun-hsiung Thursday.</P>
      <P>Chang was responding to media reports that the MOF has drafted a
plan to lower the TRF allocation ratio for the two special
municipalities from the current 43 percent to 36.22 percent for
fiscal 2003 and that the percentage for other cities and counties
will be raised to 45.72 percent from the present 39 percent.</P>
      <P>If the plan is put into force, the two special municipalities --
Taipei and Kaohsiung -- will see a decrease of NT$10.6 billion
(US$302.86 million) in their total tax redistribution funds, while
the country's other cities and counties will enjoy a NT$10.5 billion
increase in redistribution funds.</P>
      <P>The reports immediately caused a backlash from the Taipei and
Kaohsiung city governments over the MOF-proposed adjustment plan.</P>
      <P>Chang, who traveled to the central county of Taichung early in
the morning to attend a post-Sept. 21, 1999 earthquake reconstruction
promotion meeting, said he did ask the MOF to draft a TRF allocation
ratio adjustment plan earlier this year to avert frequent squabbling
among local governments over the issue of money.</P>
      <P>"The MOF has not yet presented its draft plan to the Cabinet for
approval," Chang said, adding that once the Cabinet receives the
plan, relevant central government agencies will further discuss
details with all local governments.</P>
      <P>In Taipei, Minister of Finance Yen Ching-chang said his ministry
is scheduled to discuss the issue with finance chiefs of city and
county governments this Monday.</P>
      <P>"Once the allocation ratios are settled, they will no longer be
subject to annual adjustments as in the past," Yen said.</P>
      <P>Acting on the premier's instruction, Yen said, the MOF has
invited five scholars to work out the new TRF allocation formula
after a careful evaluation of land acreage, population and tax
revenues of various localities.</P>
      <P>Yen urged Taipei and Kaohsiung municipal officials to examine
whether the new formula is reasonable and fair, instead of simply
complaining about the anticipated decrease in redistribution funds.</P>
      <P>Lin Chuan, director-general of the Directorate General of Budget,
Accounting and Statistics, said once the new TRF allocation ratios
are determined, the Cabinet will reimburse Taipei and Kaohsiung for
their diminished redistribution funds by increasing their allocation
ratios of central government grants to city and county governments.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC FOREIGN MINISTRY DISCUSSING 'INAPPROPRIATE' REMARKS WITH JAPAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  27 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China Ministry of Foreign
Affairs (MOFA) will continue discussions with Japan over comments
made by two Japanese officials that irked Taipei regarding Taiwan's
future, a senior official said Thursday at a news conference.</P>
      <P>MOFA spokeswoman Chang Siao-yue made the remarks in response to
inquiries from Japanese reporters stationed in Taipei about possible
subsequent developments after the ROC government lodged a formal
protest with Tokyo over Japanese Foreign Minister Makiko Tanaka's and
Chief Cabinet Secretary Yasuo Fukuda's recent remarks.</P>
      <P>Japanese Foreign Minister Tanaka said in an interview with a
Japanese daily Tuesday that she was hopeful that in the future,
Taiwan would be returned to China, like Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>Later, Fukuda said the Japanese government's position on the
issue has been stated in the 1972 Tokyo-Beijing joint communique:
"Taiwan is an inalienable part of the People's Republic of China and
Japan understands and respect such a stand."</P>
      <P>Chang said the Japanese government has made an initial response
to Taipei's protest through the ROC representative office in Tokyo by
reaffirming no change in its stance of hoping that the two sides of
the Taiwan Strait can resolve their sovereignty disputes using
peaceful, rational means.</P>
      <P>In response to the two Japanese ministers' remarks, ROC Vice
Minister of Foreign Affairs Wu Tzu-dan summoned Shintaro Yamashita,
director of the Taipei Office of the Japanese Interchange Association
(JIA), to the foreign ministry Wednesday to lodge a protest.</P>
      <P>Wu told Yamashita that Taiwan's situation is totally different
from that of Hong Kong and stressed that Taipei insists on resolving
cross-strait problems through peaceful negotiations.</P>
      <P>He went on to say that Taipei is against the so-called "one
country, two systems" unification formula proposed by Beijing and
added that Taiwan will continue to strive for improvement of
cross-strait relations with goodwill and sincerity.</P>
      <P>Regarding the Japanese government's stand on the Taiwan issue, Wu
said that the ROC has been an independent sovereign country since
1912.</P>
      <P>Stressing that Taiwan and mainland China are now two separate
political entities, Wu said the PRC's political jurisdiction has
never reached Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Wu delivered a memorandum to Yamashita, who promised to transmit
it to the Japanese government.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, ROC Representative to Japan Lo Fu-chuan also delivered
a letter of protest Wednesday to the Tokyo office of JIA, a
semi-official organization authorized by the Japanese government to
handle exchanges with the ROC in the absence of formal diplomatic
ties.</P>
      <P>The letter noted that the ROC on Taiwan is an independent
sovereign country and its future will be decided by the 23 million
people of Taiwan. It added that foreign officials are not allowed to
interfere.</P>
      <P>At Thursday's news conference, Chang reiterated that the ROC
government has never agreed to the 1972 Tokyo-Beijing joint statement
regarding Taiwan's status.</P>
      <P>Chang urged Japanese officials to exercise caution and prudence
in addressing the ROC-related issues. "Inappropriate remarks would
affect the close and delicate Taiwan-Japanese relations," she added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAC CALLS FOR MORE COOPERATION FROM M'LAND IN REPATRIATING ILLEGALS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 28 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC) urged mainland China Friday to cooperate more closely with
Taiwan in repatriating illegal mainland Chinese immigrants.</P>
      <P>"We need greater mainland cooperation in sending back all
captured illegal mainland immigrants," said MAC Vice Chairman Lin
Chong-pin at a regular news conference.</P>
      <P>Lin said mainland Chinese authorities should also strengthen
their border control and adopt effective measures to prevent their
people from stowing away on ships to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"Prevention of human smuggling is key to maintaining a normal
exchange order between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait," Lin said.</P>
      <P>With the assistance of the Red Cross Society on both sides of the
strait, Lin said about 2,000 illegal mainland immigrants have been
repatriated so far this year.</P>
      <P>In the past two days, Lin said, more than 300 mainland stowaways
were repatriated from the Republic of China-held frontline island of
Matsu, which lies closer to the mainland than to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"With the Spring Festival drawing near, we hope to repatriate
more illegal mainland immigrants so that they can spend the important
traditional Chinese holiday with their families," Lin said.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, over 800 illegal mainland immigrants are still
being held at the three detention centers in Hsinchu, Ilan and Matsu.
Meanwhile, 115 other illegal mainland immigrants are also waiting to
be repatriated at various police bureaus around the island.</P>
      <P>Lin said the MAC appreciates all the assistance offered by the
Red Cross Society on both sides of the Taiwan Strait in the
repatriation of mainland stowaways over the past years.</P>
      <P>"We hope mainland China will continue cooperating with Taiwan in
the repatriation of stowaways in accordance with the Kinmen Agreement
signed by Taiwan's and mainland China's Red Cross Society in 1990,"
Lin said.</P>
      <P>He said that in the coming year, the MAC, which charts Taiwan's
policy toward the mainland, will actively push for resumption of
dialogue and consultations between the Taipei-based Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF) and Beijing's Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Strait (ARATS) on non-political practical issues arising from
increased bilateral civilian exchanges, including the repatriation of
illegal mainland immigrants and the cracking down on cross-strait
smuggling and other criminal activities.</P>
      <P>AEF and ARATS are quasi-official intermediary bodies authorized
by their respective governments to handle cross-strait exchanges in

    <HEADLINE>BEEFING UP UNDERWATER COMBAT CAPABILITY KEY TO ROC NAVY BUILDUP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  28  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Building a submarine fleet to deter a
possible mainland Chinese naval blockade should be one of the top
goals of the Republic of China's military buildup, a senior Ministry
of National Defense (MND) official said Friday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a seminar on submarines and Taiwan's naval defense,
Chang Shih-po, an MND division chief in charge of logistic support
affairs, said the Taiwan Strait will be a flashpoint in East Asia.</P>
      <P>"As mainland China is likely to use its large submarine fleet to
impose a blockade on Taiwan, we should beef up our anti-submarine
combat capabilities," Chang explained.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that mainland China has been expanding its navy
and equipment in recent years.</P>
      <P>In addition to beefing up its ocean-going naval fleet, Chang
said, mainland China has also built up the world's third-largest
submarine fleet and has continued to renovate relevant facilities and
weaponry systems.</P>
      <P>Noting that submarines offer the most lethal means of disrupting
shipping services, Chang said Taiwan must upgrade its anti-submarine,
anti-blockade capabilities to ensure smooth maritime traffic in its
surrounding areas, which is crucial to the island's export-oriented
economy.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has traditionally relied on advanced countries for the
supply of submarines and related weaponry systems, Chang went on,
adding that since the United States has agreed to sell eight
conventional diesel-powered submarines to Taiwan, the ROC military
should take advantage of the opportunity to foster its own submarine
design and manufacturing capabilities.</P>
      <P>Chang further said that the ROC should seek to participate in the
production of the eight conventional submarines the United States has
agreed to sell. As the United States has long stopped production of
diesel submarines, it may have to seek cooperation with other
countries to fulfill its deal with Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN PEOPLE `MOST ASHAMED' ABOUT POLITICAL POWER STRUGGLES: SURVEY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 28 (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The people of Taiwan are "most ashamed" of
power struggles between politicians and consider economic stability
to be the key to Taiwan's prosperity, according to the results of a
survey released Friday by the Common Wealth magazine.</P>
      <P>The Chinese-language monthly conducted the survey among 1,069
people aged over 18 selected at random from around the island from
Dec. 20-23.</P>
      <P>Of the people who responded, 56 percent said they consider
conflicts between political parties to be the most serious crisis
facing Taiwan, while 37.9 percent said they consider provocative and
manipulative tendencies of the media to be the most serious crisis
and 25.4 percent said they are most worried about the decline of
social values.</P>
      <P>While mainland China is seen by many as a constant threat to
Taiwan, 24.8 percent of the people said they are most concerned about
the upswing of the mainland economy.</P>
      <P>Forty-eight percent of the respondents said they are optimistic
about Taiwan's future, against 26 percent who are pessimistic. A
similar survey conducted a year ago showed that only 34.5 percent of
the respondents were positive about the prospects at the time, while
37 percent were pessimistic.</P>
      <P>According to a report on the survey results, the increased
optimism is mainly because of the healthy development of Taiwan's
democracy and justice system.</P>
      <P>About 30 percent of the respondents said they have seen
improvements in the justice system and 53 percent said that the
crackdown on "black gold" politics has been effective since President
Chen Shui-bian assumed office in May 2000.</P>
      <P>According to the survey report, economic prosperity was chosen as
the top priority by the poll respondents over the past four years,
while political stability, personal security and administrative
efficiency were also subjects of concern.</P>
      <P>The survey results also show that 21 percent of the respondents
wish to emigrate to escape the political chaos.</P>
      <P>The United States and Canada are the favored destinations of 31
percent of those who want to get out of Taiwan, compared with 43
percent in a similar survey in December 2000.</P>
      <P>The results also show that 21 percent would choose to emigrate to
mainland China, compared to the previous year, when only 8.7 percent
chose mainland China as their favored destination.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 28 (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition alliance legislators tentatively
decided Friday to insist that the Cabinet slash its fiscal 2002
budget by a further NT$90.7 billion (US$2.6 billion).</P>
      <P>The opposition Kuomintang, People First Party and New Party
lawmakers -- who together comprise the majority in the Legislative
Yuan -- said that the Cabinet's estimate of government revenue for
next year has been "seriously padded" and determined that expenditure
will have to be adjusted if the budget is to be balanced.</P>
      <P>Some of the items that the opposition lawmakers determined should
be trimmed include the defense budget, the security personnel budget
for former Republic of China President Lee Teng-hui, personnel
expenditures for the Ministry of the Interior and the budget for the
largely superficial Taiwan Provincial Consultative Council.</P>
      <P>However, ruling Democratic Progressive Party whip Tsai
Huang-liang condemned the move and said that budget reviews should be
conducted pragmatically item-by-item, with reasons given for each
adjustment in accordance with each year's policy focus, instead of
"irresponsibly" slashing the budget with one broad stroke.</P>
      <P>Tsai said that his legislative caucus will consult the opposition
parties before the budget undergoes its final review and added that
lawmakers should not dogmatically follow the ratio of budget cuts in
previous years as the benchmark for the upcoming year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MILITARY CHIEF STRESSES TRANSPARENCY IN PERSONNEL RESHUFFLE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  28  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Chief of the General Staff Gen. Tang
Yao-ming stressed Friday that transparency is the top operational
guideline for military personnel reshuffles.</P>
      <P>"No individual can single-handedly influence military personnel
transfers or replacements," Tang said in response to press inquiries
about a possible shakeup of the military brass in the near future.</P>
      <P>Tang also said President Chen Shui-bian has so far not discussed
any military personnel reshuffle plans with him.</P>
      <P>"If President Chen brings up the issue with me, I would certainly
request him to respect `military ethics' in any personnel reshuffle,"
said Tang.</P>
      <P>Tang said he has on many occasions suggested to Chen that a two-
or three-year tenure system be established for senior military
positions.</P>
      <P>"This is a practice widely adopted in advanced democratic
countries," Tang said, adding that Chen supports his suggestion.</P>
      <P>As the present Cabinet is expected to resign en masse before the
inauguration of the new legislature in February 2002, speculation
about various possible military personnel changes has been rife since
the end of the Dec. 1 legislative elections.</P>
      <P>Tang said that this speculation has smeared the military's clean
image and he expressed worry that it might mislead other countries
into perceiving that Taiwan's senior military officers are fond of
power struggles and satisfying personal interests.</P>
      <P>In reality, Tang said, most military officers and career soldiers
are conscientious and harbor no grievances about their heavy
workload.</P>
      <P>"Unfounded speculation about personnel reshuffles is unfair and
harmful to our military servicemen who have dedicated themselves to
national service," Tang said.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, at a seminar on the Republic of China's
military buildup plan, Tang delivered a speech on the new direction
of the country's military education.</P>
      <P>Tang said Taiwan must invest generously in military education and
take bold steps to rid the existing military educational system of
obsolete practices or burdens in order to cultivate a new generation
of military officers and talent.</P>
      <P>Noting that the top goal of military education is to upgrade the
quality of military cadres, Tang said military educational reform is
critical to the ROC's ambitious military modernization plan.</P>
      <P>In the face of the rapid development of information technology
and the knowledge-based economy, Tang said Taiwan's military
education must keep abreast of these prevailing trends.</P>
      <P>"We must shed outdated shackles and use new thinking and new
concepts in crafting a new military educational system for the new
century in order to train a new generation of military cadres to meet
the demand of the digital technology-characterized society," Tang
said.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan will become a formal member of the World Trade
Organization at the beginning of the new year, Tang said, its
military educational system must be compatible with general
international trends.</P>
      <P>Moreover, he continued, military educational institutions must
strengthen cooperation and interaction with civilian educational and
research institutions to make better use of the country's resources.</P>
      <P>The military should also work out its special educational goals
based on its own resources, unique features and demands, Tang added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CSC EMPLOYEES PROTEST AGAINST FORCED LAYOFFS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  Dec. 28 (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The China Shipbuilding Corp. (CSC) will
implement a "company re-adjustment" layoff program before the end of
this year, despite resistance from those who will be forced into
early retirement, a company spokesman said Friday.</P>
      <P>Because the state-run enterprise's operational losses have
accumulated to NT$10.5 billion in recent months, the Ministry of
Economic Affairs (MOEA) instructed the company to draft a "company
re-adjustment program" -- a euphemism for personnel layoffs.</P>
      <P>CSC then drafted a proposal to cut staff by 47 percent from over
5,000 to less than 2,800, while the survivors will face a 35 percent
salary cut starting next year.</P>
      <P>When the number of employees willing to accept early retirement
failed to reach the target of 2,300, the CSC management made further
selections based on performance and office attendance.</P>
      <P>Many of those forced to retire questioned the fairness of the
management. A total of 2,001 employees signed a petition to the
Bureau of Labor Affairs of the Kaohsiung city government and
representatives of the employees submitted the petition to the bureau
Friday, hoping for a fair settlement.</P>
      <P>The CSC spokesman said that 1,400 employees of the CSC's
Kaohsiung shipyard and 900 employees of the Keelung shipyard will be
laid off. Most of those on the layoff list have agreed to accept the
pensions offered to them. As for the more-than 200 employees who
refuse to be forced into early retirement, the Bureau of Labor
Affairs should help find a settlement, he added.</P>
      <P>According to the spokesman, the CSC management is compelled to
carry out the layoffs because the MOEA requires the company to
implement the program before it will grant CSC a special rescue fund,
which will include money for the pensions, together with
re-investment capital.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan has agreed to set aside NT$9 billion as a CSC
special pension fund. In order to improve the company operations, CSC
has asked the Cabinet for another NT$6 billion for company
reinvestment.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC CAN OBTAIN SUBMARINES THROUG  VARIOUS CHANNELS: DEFENSE OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 28 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China may add submarines to
its defenses by combining purchases from overseas, working with
foreign contractors through joint ventures, and building the vessels
in Taiwan, a defense official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Chang Shih-po, an official in charge of military supplies at the
Ministry of National Defense, pointed out in a symposium on
"Submarines and security across the Taiwan Strait" that the ROC is a
country heavily dependent on international trade, and open sea lanes
are vital to its national security.</P>
      <P>History is rifle with examples where blockades of shipping have
been used to weaken an enemy or bring it to its knees, and submarines
are an effective means to block shipping, Chang said.</P>
      <P>Noting that Beijing has been aggressively building up its navy in
recent years, Chang said the mainland has turned from a coastal navy
to an ocean-faring one and now aspires to enhance its deep water
capabilities.</P>
      <P>In light of the fact that Beijing's navy boasts the world's
third-largest submarine fleet, which is capable of blockading Taiwan,
Chang said, it is urgent for the ROC to acquire a submarine deterrent
to thwart any such attempts on Beijing's part.</P>
      <P>Taipei has three options to acquire submarines, namely purchasing
them from abroad, building them in cooperation with foreign
contractors and building them on its own. Using the three options
effectively will not only decrease the cost and shorten the time it
takes to acquire the vessels, Chang said, but also boost the ROC's
defense industry and improve defense technology.</P>
      <P>Other scholars at the symposium said Washington's promise to sell
eight diesel submarines to Taiwan provide the island a valuable
chance to establish contacts with foreign defense contractors and
develop its own submarine operations systems.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has been denied this chance owing to its diplomatic
isolation, they said.</P>

      <P>Four private air carriers, two each from
Taiwan and Hong Kong, exchanged memorandums of understanding Friday
to renew the aviation pact between Taiwan and Hong Kong for another
six months. The current agreement expires at the end of December.</P>
      <P>The renewal means the 121 flights per week by each side between
the two places will continue at least until the end of June.</P>
      <P>This is the second time the pact has been renewed without being
re-negotiated. It was renewed for six months before expiring June 12.
The impasse stems from Taiwan's insistence to re-negotiate the pact
by authorities of each side while Beijing insists on letting the four
air carriers which fly the routes to make a deal on their own.</P>
      <P>Taiwan denounced Beijing's refusal to open negotiations on the
aviation pact as an attempt to debase the island.</P>
      <P>More than four million passengers travel the Hong Kong-Taiwan
route every year, which is three times the passenger load between
Taiwan and the United States.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is proposing to increase the flights by 49 per week, while

    <TEXT>
      <P>Scores of members of the Taiwan
Independence Party (TAIP) staged a demonstration in front of the
Kaohsiung Office of the Japanese Interchange Association (JIA) Friday
to protest a Japanese official's remarks on Taiwan's future.</P>
      <P>The demonstrators carried posters and banners protesting Japanese
Foreign Minister Makiko Tanaka's recent remarks that she was hopeful
that in the future, the Taiwan issue will turn out like Hong Kong.
The former British colony reverted to mainland China's control in
1997 under a "one country, two systems" formula.</P>
      <P>Lee Cheng-hsien, head of the TAIP chapter in the southern Taiwan
port city, who led the demonstration, said Tanaka's remarks have
seriously hurt the interests of the people of Taiwan, interfered with
the island's domestic politics and undermined Taiwan's sovereign
status.</P>
      <P>Lee said Tanaka owes Taiwan's government and people an apology
for her inappropriate statements, adding that Japanese Prime Minister
Junichiro Koizumi should also assume responsibility for his Cabinet
member's improper remarks.</P>
      <P>Stressing that Taiwan is an independent, sovereign state, Lee
said Taiwan neither belongs to China nor to any other country.
"Tanaka's remarks only betray her ignorance of Taiwan's history and
the present situation across the Taiwan Strait," Lee lamented.</P>
      <P>The demonstration ended after two JIA officials accepted the
TAIP's protest letter. JIA is a quasi-official institution authorized
by the Japanese government to handle exchanges with Taiwan in the
absence of formal diplomatic ties.</P>
      <P>The Republic of China government had already lodged a formal
protest with Japan Wednesday over Tanaka's remarks.</P>

(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Taiwan trade promotion team scheduled to
travel to Latin America in March will bypass Argentina owing to the
chaotic situation unfolding in that country, according to an
economics official Friday.</P>
      <P>Instead, the team will visit Peru instead of Argentina. Its trips
to Mexico, Brazil and Chile will remain unchanged, the official at
the Ministry of Economic Affairs said.</P>
      <P>Noting that the prospects for Argentina's economy are dim in the
near future in light of the scarcity of hard currency and the surging
unemployment in that country -- in addition to the presidential
election in March -- officials said they are not sure the situation
will stabilize before the trip by the Taiwan delegation in March.</P>
      <P>The ministry's representative office in Argentina has been aware
of the increased risk of doing business in Argentina over the last
three years as the country's economy has been languishing. Many large
companies have stopped paying their foreign debts, the official said.</P>
      <P>The ministry also warned those in Taiwan doing business in
Argentina to take into account the current political and economic
situations in the country.</P>
      <P>Many international trade fairs, slated to take place in Argentina
next year, including an Asian trade fair scheduled for the first half
of 2002, have either been canceled or postponed, the official said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan regularly dispatches teams of trade officials and
businessmen around the world to canvass business and investment for
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In addition to the team going to Latin American, the Ministry of
Economic Affairs will also send teams to Japan, the Middle East,
Eastern Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States next year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN'S OIL PRODUCTS SUPPLIERS EXPECTING FIERCE COMPETITION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 29 (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>With the liberalization of the oil products
market starting next year, Taiwan's oil products suppliers are
expecting fierce competition in the coming months, a spokesman of the
Chinese Petroleum Corp. (CPC) said Saturday.</P>
      <P>The CPC is currently the biggest oil products supplier to
domestic gas service stations, with around 1,600 gas stations around
the island being supplied with CPC oil products. Formosa Petroleum
Corp. (FPC) has contracts with 400 domestic gas service stations,
while Taiwan's other gas service stations are supplied by imported
products.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs announced this week that the
domestic oil products market will be opened to imports starting next
year. A total of 18 companies have submitted their applications to
the ministry for wholesale licenses.</P>
      <P>The giant international oil company Exxon-Mobil has partnered up
with the Pan Overseas Corp. to supply gasoline to service stations in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>A spokesman of the Pan Overseas Corp. said Friday that the
company's newly built oil tanks at Taichung Harbor will be in use in
two months and that the company will try to win supplying contracts
from gas service stations around the island.</P>
      <P>The gas service stations run by the CPC and FPC recently have
launched a series of promotional campaigns, including offering
discounts, holding lottery draws for sedans and giving away
souvenirs.</P>
      <P>Facing the impending fierce competition, some small gas stations
have sought to improve their competitiveness by joining into
alliances. More than 200 such gas service stations have signed
contracts with the Taiwan-Up Alliance. The franchise will help the
gas stations reduce their costs through joint procurement.</P>
      <P>The Fair Trade Commission under the Executive Yuan announced last
week that gas service stations are allowed to break their oil
contracts and switch suppliers before the end of March, 2002.</P>
      <P>The new measure will give oil supplying companies newly entering
the Taiwan market a fair chance to compete. At the same, domestic gas
service stations can expect more benefits from their suppliers,
according to a spokesman of the commission.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SCHOLARS CALL FOR REVISIONS TO LABOR STANDARDS LAW</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  29  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of local scholars urged the
government Saturday to amend the Labor Standards Law to offer greater
room and flexibility for employers and employees in negotiating
working terms.</P>
      <P>The academics made the appeal at a seminar on Taiwan's labor
policy and labor-management disputes, sponsored by the opposition
Kuomintang-affiliated National Policy Research Foundation and chaired
by former Council of Labor Affairs Chairman Tsan Hou-sheng.</P>
      <P>Chinese Culture University professor Yang Tung-hsuan said the
Labor Standards Law is mainly designed to protect the rights and
interests of the employee.</P>
      <P>"But many provisions in the current law, enacted in 1984, are too
rigid and strict on employers," Yang said, adding that some
requirements, including demanding that employers pay for social
insurance programs, would hinder local enterprises' competitiveness
after Taiwan's accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) at the
beginning of 2002.</P>
      <P>National Taiwan University professor Wu Chung-chi echoed Yang's
words, saying that local companies must adjust their structures as
well as their management and marketing strategies to cope with
rapidly changing global economic trends after Taiwan's WTO entry.</P>
      <P>"However, some existing Labor Standards Law provisions may hamper
certain badly needed flexible adjustments," Wu said, adding that the
law should be revised to ease restrictions on labor working terms.</P>
      <P>By so doing, Wu said, employers and their employees will have
greater room to negotiate commercially viable and mutually acceptable
contracts.</P>
      <P>Legislator-elect Chiu Yi, also an economist, said all
labor-related laws should be made more flexible to allow labor and
management to conduct rational consultations on working terms.</P>
      <P>Chiu, a key member of the opposition People First Party, further
said the Democratic Progressive Party government should refrain from
manipulating the operations of various labor organizations so that
labor unions can grow smoothly and become strong enough to negotiate
with management on an equal footing to protect labor rights.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER URGES LAWMAKERS TO SUPPORT 2002 FISCAL BUDGET</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  29 (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung urged lawmakers
Saturday to support the 2002 fiscal budget, instead of slashing it,
in order to help the government stimulate the economy by rolling out
public projects.</P>
      <P>Chang made his plea in response to the opposition legislative
alliance's tentative decision made the previous day to trim the
fiscal budget by a further NT$90.7 billion (US$2.6 billion) after
accusing the Cabinet of "seriously padding" the projected government
revenue for next year.</P>
      <P>The premier said that his administration's efforts to promote
public investments and create job opportunities would be dampened if
a budget that was put together under already difficult circumstances
was slashed even further.</P>
      <P>Some of the items that the opposition lawmakers determined should
be trimmed include the defense budget, the security personnel budget
for former Republic of China President Lee Teng-hui, personnel
expenditures for the Ministry of the Interior and the budget for the
largely superficial Taiwan Provincial Consultative Council.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chang said that the Ministry of Finance (MOF) will
continue to coordinate and communicate with the heads of various
cities and counties around the island on the ministry's plans to
adjust the allocation ratios of tax redistribution funds.</P>
      <P>Chang said that the draft proposal has yet to reach the Executive
Yuan for approval and that he hopes the central and local governments
can work together to tide over the difficult times for government
finances by reaching an agreement on a mutually acceptable plan.</P>
      <P>He was responding to media reports that the MOF has drafted a
plan to lower the redistribution fund's allocation ratio for the two
special municipalities from the current 43 percent to 36.22 percent
for fiscal 2003 and that the percentage for other cities and counties
will be raised to 45.72 percent from the present 39 percent.</P>
      <P>If the plan is put into force, the two special municipalities --
Taipei and Kaohsiung -- will see a decrease of NT$10.6 billion
(US$302 million) in their total tax redistribution funds, while other
cities and counties will enjoy a NT$10.5 billion increase in
redistribution funds.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOFA RECRUITING VOLUNTEERS TO WORK FOR ANTI-AIDS PROGRAM IN CHAD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 29 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said
Saturday it will recruit volunteers with public health training
backgrounds to work for an anti-AIDS program in the central African
state of Chad.</P>
      <P>MOFA officials said the ministry signed an agreement with Care
France, a French charitable organization, in November, under which
the Republic of China will offer a total of US$1.02 million over
three years to finance an AIDS prevention and control program in
Chad.</P>
      <P>"The project is mainly aimed at establishing a nationwide
comprehensive educational and publicity system in Chad in order to
upgrade its people's awareness of the deadly disease and the major
ways they can protect themselves from contracting AIDS, and to curb
the spread of the disease," said a MOFA official.</P>
      <P>To cultivate more diplomatic talent to facilitate Taiwan's
participation in major international organizations and activities,
the official said, the MOFA is cooperating with the Department of
Health (DOH) in recruiting trained volunteers to work for the
anti-AIDS program in Chad.</P>
      <P>Those who have a bachelor degree or above in public health or who
have participated in anti-AIDS field studies and can speak fluent
French or English are welcome to register for the Chad program, the
official said.</P>
      <P>Registration will close Jan. 15. The MOFA and the DOH will
jointly select qualified hopefuls to work in Chad for three months
from February through mid-May 2002.</P>
      <P>Hopefuls should e-mail their personal resumes to either the DOH
Web site at yuchen@cdc.gov.tw or the MOFA address at

    <HEADLINE>MEDICINE USING ANCIENT CHINESE RECIPE SAID GOOD FOR COLDS, CANCER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  Nov.  28  (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An ancient Chinese recipe has been given
new life in Newfoundland, Canada, as part of an alternative medicine
for cancer sufferers and those with immune system diseases.</P>
      <P>The product's name is "Ning," and it is being manufactured in the
eastern Canadian province based on a recipe using Astragulus, a woody
herb that grows in the mountains of Mongolia, according to Canada's
national broadcaster.</P>
      <P>The Canadian Broadcasting Corp. (CBC) said Friday that Ning is
the brainchild of Xianging Chang and Robert Trenholm. Chang went to
Newfoundland to pursue a master's degree in toxicology. She then
joined up with Acta Herb to develop her research into Astragulus.</P>
      <P>For years in China, the emperor and his family used Astragulus
because they called it a superb herb tonic, the CBC quoted Chang as
saying. He also noted that the herb has been used to treat people
with kidney failure in China.</P>
      <P>North Americans have been using Astragulus since the 1970s. But
it has been used in tinctures and caplets, which Chang said are not
very effective. The ancient Chinese infused the Astragulus root with
warm water, much like a tea.</P>
      <P>Chang uses an herbal distribution company in mainland China to
farm the Astragulus. In Beijing, the active ingredients are dried
into powder and packed into bags. Juice from sea buckthorn, a plant
cultivated in Asia rich in vitamin A and vitamin C, is added to the
mix.</P>
      <P>In carrying out their research, Chang and Trenholm started
experimenting with different formulas. One day, Trenholm began coming
down with the flu and decided to take the concoction he had made that
day. He said he was fine by the next day. Since then, the pair have
stuck to that recipe.</P>
      <P>However, Trenholm pointed out that the flavor may take some
getting used to, saying that concoction has "a kind of rooty, earthy
flavor to it with a citrus background."</P>
      <P>Astragulus is good at boosting the immune system, Chang said,
adding that the product works on everything from the common cold to
asthma, arthritis and cancer.</P>
      <P>"We have a lady who had asthma for five years and was using a
puffer and some hormone products, but after she started taking this,
she never needed the puffer again," Chang said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SALE OF RED LABEL RICE WINE AT CURRENT PRICE ENDS DEC. 31</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  29  (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The scene of people lining up to buy Red
Label rice wine is expected to become a thing of the past as of Jan.
1, when the state-owned Taiwan Tobacco and Wine Board (TTWB) is set
to hike the price of the popular kitchen staple more than fivefold.</P>
      <P>According to the TTWB's latest figures, approximately 70 million
bottles of Red Label rice wine, currently priced at NT$21 (US$0.60)
per 0.6 liter bottle, have been sold over the past two months as
consumers rush to stock up on the liquor, which is especially popular
in the winter because it is a major ingredient in many Chinese hot
stews.</P>
      <P>Although the exact level of the price hike is not scheduled to be
announced until the afternoon of the last day of this year, NT$90
(US$2.57) per bottle in taxes to be levied on the wine after Taiwan's
World Trade Organization entry Jan. 1 will drive up the price to
approximately NT$120 (US$3.42) per bottle.</P>
      <P>The run on the liquor has led to record sales figures as people
line up before TTWB distribution centers around the island to buy the
wine, which began to be rationed at the end of last month such that
each household can now only purchase a maximum of six bottles. Retail
stores have also been having difficulty maintaining adequate supplies
of the wine on their shelves due to the high demand.</P>
      <P>According to the TTWB, all four of its production lines have been
cranked into full gear, with the end result being that the number of
bottles sold over the past two months actually exceeded the lines'
maximum estimated total production capacity of 60 million bottles for
that period by 10 million.</P>
      <P>TTWB officials said that retailers can continue to sell Red Label
rice wine produced before the end of this year after Jan. 1 but must
do so at the current price. Stores found to be selling the wine at
the new price will be fined NT$2,000 (US$57) per bottle sold, they
warned, adding that any unsold bottles at the TTWB's own distribution
centers by yearend will be rounded up to be repackaged under the new
label that will replace the original one.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC LAWMAKERS DEMAND TANAKA APOLOGIZE FOR INAPPROPRIATE REMARKS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Tokyo, Dec. 29 (CNA)
(By Amy Huang and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Three visiting Republic of China legislators
demanded Saturday that Japanese Foreign Minister Makiko Tanaka
apologize for her recent remarks on Taiwan's future.</P>
      <P>The three female lawmakers from Taiwan's ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) said they admire Tanaka's courage in pushing
for bureaucratic reforms but regret her lack of international vision
and knowledge about Taiwan's history and status.</P>
      <P>The trio -- Tang Pi-o, Wang Li-ping and Chang Hsiu-chen -- said
at a news conference that Tanaka owes the people of Taiwan an apology
for her comment that she is hopeful that in the future, the Taiwan
issue will turn out in a way similar to that of Hong Kong. The former
British colony reverted to mainland China's rule in July 1997 under a
"one country, two systems" formula.</P>
      <P>Tang said Tanaka's remarks not only hurt the feelings of the
people of Taiwan but also undermined Japan's national dignity.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the future of Taiwan should be determined by the
23 million residents of the island in a democratic manner, Tang said
Tanaka's statements marked a gross interference with Taiwan's
domestic affairs and an infringement upon the ROC's sovereignty.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Tang said, any issues between the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait should be resolved through peaceful consultations on an
equal footing.</P>
      <P>Tang reminded Tanaka never to forget that she is a Japanese
foreign minister, not a mouthpiece of mainland China, whenever she
addresses Taiwan-related issues.</P>
      <P>Tang and her two colleagues arrived in Tokyo Friday night for a
goodwill visit to promote parliamentary exchanges between the two
countries.</P>
      <P>"After our arrival, we decided to call an impromptu news
conference this morning to voice our protests to the Japanese
government over Tanaka's remarks and demand an apology from Tanaka
herself," Tang said.</P>
      <P>The ROC government already lodged a formal protest with Japan
Wednesday over Tanaka's comments.</P>
      <P>On Friday, ROC Representative to Japan Lo Fu-chuan demanded that
Tanaka retract her remarks made Tuesday suggesting that she supported
Taiwan's unification with mainland China using the formula applied to
Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>Lo demanded to know whether Tanaka's remarks signify a change in
Tokyo's stance on the issue. Without taking sides, Tokyo has
traditionally called for Taipei-Beijing disputes to be resolved
through peaceful means.</P>
      <P>In his statement, Lo expressed regret and indignation at Tanaka's
statement, stressing that the ROC on Taiwan is a sovereign nation,
that Taiwan is not Hong Kong and that Taiwan's future must be decided
by its 23 million residents.</P>
      <P>Tanaka said at a news conference earlier Friday that when she
said she hopes Taiwan could be like Hong Kong, she meant that the
Hong Kong issue was resolved peacefully, and that she hopes the
Taiwan issue will also be resolved through peaceful negotiations
without the use of force.</P>
      <P>Tokyo switched its diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing
in 1972, when Tanaka's father was prime minister.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BOFT TO SET UP INTERNATIONAL TRADE OPPORTUNITY DATABANK</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  30  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Board of Foreign Trade (BOFT) has
decided to make good use of trade information collected overseas and
will establish a trade opportunity databank for use by Taiwan
manufacturers.</P>
      <P>BOFT officials said more than 100 overseas missions around the
world each year collect valuable business information for Taiwan
manufacturers to promote their trade overseas, adding that the
missions have sent back 15,000 pieces of business information from
July to November this year.</P>
      <P>They said that such information will be sent to various business
associations for Taiwan manufacturers. This is in contrast with past
practices of directly channeling the information to the
manufacturers, which risked having an adverse effect of creating
cutthroat competition among the manufacturers.</P>
      <P>Also, to prevent international groups from spreading fraudulent
trade information or mainland Chinese manufacturers trying to cheat
Taiwan manufactures with false orders, the China External Trade
Development Council (CETRA) will also establish a databank of
international groups known to have committed fraud for the reference
of the domestic private sector.</P>
      <P>In addition, as overseas manufacturers have complained that
overseas credit checks are difficult to obtain, the CETRA and
Export-Import Bank of the Republic of China will help domestic
manufacturers check overseas company credit ratings to reduce the
financial risk to the manufacturers.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN BUSINESSMEN IN MAINLAND BECOMING AWARE OF POLITICAL RISKS (I)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 30 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Beijing's censorship of text books used in
Taiwanese schools in mainland China and the formation of Chinese
Communist cells in Taiwanese corporations in mainland China have
driven home to Taiwanese businessmen the political risk of doing
business across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Their worries are deepening as their position as the powerhouses
behind much of the economic development in the mainland is being
eroded by the encroachment of multinational investors.</P>
      <P>The first signs that Beijing was closing the political noose
around the necks of Taiwan businessmen appeared last year when Lee
Bingcai, deputy director of the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State
Council, warned that Beijing authorities would not let Taiwan
businessmen "make money in mainland China while supporting Taiwan
independence at home."</P>
      <P>Since then, several Taiwan corporations considered by Beijing to
be supporters of Taiwan independence have seen their mainland Chinese
subsidiaries harassed by local authorities under the pretext of
account audits, fire safety inspections and others.</P>
      <P>These moves have frightened Taiwan businessmen who operate in
mainland China into staying out of politics in Taiwan. They have also
bent over backward to stay out of political disputes between Taipei
and Beijing after ties between them became strained over Beijing's
claim that Taipei had reneged on its agreement to the "one China"
principle.</P>
      <P>A Taiwanese executive at a Taiwan-funded electronics company in
Guangdong province, southern China, said Taiwan businessmen who
ventured into mainland China because of the economic advantages there
have failed to take into account the political risks that accompany
their investments.</P>
      <P>The risks, brought about by the five-decade political tussle
between Taiwan and mainland China, include the potential for assets
of Taiwan companies in mainland China to be commandeered or
confiscated according to whichever way the current political wind is
blowing over the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Other concerns include the threat of open hostilities between the
two and the ever-present negative reactions by Beijing to nearly all
efforts of Taiwan to position itself in the international community.

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 30 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwanese executive, who has been posted to Guangdong for
five years, said Taiwan businessmen have learned to refrain from
getting embroiled in any controversial political issues after Lee's
warning -- despite the fact that none of them have been forced to
denounce in public any support for Taiwan independence that they may
have.</P>
      <P>Actually, most Taiwan businessmen operating in mainland China are
investing there under the name of companies registered in countries
other than Taiwan, such as Samoa, or the Virgin Islands, as a shield
against political risks.</P>
      <P>Another financial manager for a Taiwan-funded business in
Guangdong province said the financial management of his company was
based overseas, funneling into mainland China no more funds than are
needed for a month at a time.</P>
      <P>The advantage of having a financial base out of both Taiwan and
mainland China is to transfer assets easily out of mainland China in
case of trouble, he said.</P>
      <P>Media reports that the Chinese Communist Party is penetrating
into Taiwan companies in mainland China and is wooing Taiwan
businessmen to join the party have become a hot topic of discussion
among Taiwan businessmen in mainland China recently.</P>
      <P>Chang Han-wen, president of the Taiwan Businessman's Association
in Dongguan, Guangdong province, said he doubts any Taiwan
businessmen will ever succumb to Beijing's lure.</P>
      <P>Instead of improving business in mainland China, membership in
the Chinese Communist Party will make things more difficult for
Taiwan businessmen, Chang said.</P>
      <P>Chiang Yan-hsiung, president of the same association in Shenzhen,
Guangdong province, said most Taiwan businessmen have gone into
mainland China on the basis of "all business, no politics."</P>
      <P>Membership in the Chinese Communist Party would not necessarily
help Taiwan businessmen in mainland China, Chiang said.</P>
      <P>Many working for Taiwan companies' mainland subsidiaries are
communists but they don't enjoy any privileges that are not afforded
non-communists in the workplace, Chiang said.</P>
      <P>Another Taiwan businessmen, identified only by his surname, Lin,
dismissed the possibility of political risks, saying that Beijing's
admittance into the World Trade Organization will force the country
to adopt the rule of law.</P>
      <P>He said that the days when good connections with the upper
political crust made the difference in business circles will
gradually disappear. Moreove, Taiwan businessmen will be shielded
from political risks as will be the case with any other investor from
another country.</P>

      <P>The government must adhere to the budget as
decided upon by the Legislative Yuan and not use the funds for any
other purpose than how the money is to be allocated, a spokesman for
the opposition Legislative caucus said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Ho Chih-hui, representative of the KMT Legislative caucus, said
that opposition parties have decided to cut NT$90.7 billion from the
budget as it views this as political largesse needlessly added by the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party government.</P>
      <P>The government, therefore, should use the budget in accordance
with decisions made by the Legislative Yuan, Ho said.</P>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan is now screening national budget proposalfor
fiscal 2002.</P>
      <P>Ho said that the opposition parties have decided to cut the
NT$90.7 billion from the budget because the amount earmarked by the
government was not in accordance with the figures released by
government agencies' projections.</P>
      <P>He further pointed out that the budget as proposed by the
government would result in a surplus of NT$200 billion. He said that
the unrealistic revenue surplus was "false and empty." To prevent the
government from using the extra money for purposes not authorized in
the budget, the Legislature will adopt a resolution to prohibit the
government from using the funds for other purposes, Ho said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SCHOLARS QUESTION SENSATIONALISTIC ETHICS IN CURRENT JOURNALISM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  31  (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Recent stories reported by the media in
Taiwan show that sensationalism has become so pervasive that many
analysts are wondering if the ethics of the media has slipped into
the realm of yellow journalism.</P>
      <P>Professor Yang Chih-hung, dean of the Journalism School of Ming
Chuan University, said recently that "Next" magazine, a weekly
serving a mishmash of sex, gossip and paparazzi-style "exposes," is
having a negative knock-on effect on Taiwan's media ethics.</P>
      <P>Yang said that the print and electronic media in Taiwan have
resorted more and more to covering what passes as news with
sensational embellishment since the appearance of "Next" magazine in
late May 2001. Even the mainstream media have been dragged down to
the level of pandering to the lowest denominator by the
"contamination" of "Next," Yang contended.</P>
      <P>The professor suggested that a media regulatory organization be
created to monitor and discipline the media. As commercialization
finds its way into reporting, ethics stand to suffer, according to
the scholar.</P>
      <P>Professor Lo Wen-hui of National Chengchi University said that
local media is providing more coverage of gossip about celebrities
because the public finds it entertaining. He said that he was not
convinced that "Next" magazine should shoulder the blame for the
current atmosphere in the media.</P>
      <P>James Jin, chairman of the Magazine Business Association of
Taipei, said that at the association's next board meeting on Jan. 4,
2002, he would raise the issue of self-discipline among magazine
owners and editors.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN SET TO EMBRACE WTO MEMBERSHIP DESPITE CHALLENGES (I)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 31 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>After over a decade of persistence, Taiwan
will finally become a full member of the World Trade Organization
(WTO) Jan. 1, 2002, and officials say that although there may be some
stormy seas for several economic sectors, for the most part, WTO
membership will be clear sailing in the long run for the island.</P>
      <P>Individual consumers, in particular, will benefit most from the
historic event. Nevertheless, WTO entry will certainly have an
adverse impact on certain fields of the domestic economy, including
agriculture, traditional industries, the automobile industry and even
the information technology industry.</P>
      <P>On the eve of the anticipated changes in Taiwan's economic
landscape, many local people still have mixed feelings about the
Taiwan's membership in the Geneva-based world trade regulatory body.</P>
      <P>In an effort to allay public misgivings and suspicions about the
possible negative impacts, Ho Mei-yueh, vice chairwoman of the
Council for Economic Planning and Development, said at a seminar Dec.
30 that WTO entry will enable Taiwan to trade with more than 140
other countries around the world on an equal footing.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan relies heavily on foreign trade, with the
total amount of exports and imports exceeding the island's annual
gross domestic product (GDP), Ho said WTO entry will help ensure
equal trading status and benefits for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"In the past, our major trading partners didn't adopt
discriminatory measures against us mainly because they thought that
Taiwan would eventually become a WTO member," Ho explained.</P>
      <P>After decades of operations, Ho said, the WTO has developed a
comprehensive, binding mechanism for regulating international trading
practices and resolving trade disputes.</P>
      <P>"WTO accession will offer Taiwan a formal channel through which
to consult with other members in forging new trade deals and settling
trade disputes," Ho said, adding that the WTO mechanism will
facilitate Taiwan's trade expansion and globalization.</P>
      <P>More importantly, Ho said, WTO membership will allow Taiwan to
have a say in the formulation of new international trade rules and
regulations.</P>
      <P>Because of mainland China's diplomatic embargo, Taiwan has been
unable to join the United Nations. Ho said a seat in the WTO, which
is known as the "economic United Nations," will be conducive to
helping upgrade Taiwan's international profile.</P>
      <P>Touching on the price Taiwan will have to pay for its WTO
accession, Ho said that superficially, the island may lose a huge
amount of tariff revenues as it must lower import duties on more than
5,000 agricultural and industrial items in the first year after
entry.</P>
      <P>"The impact, however, will be manageable," Ho said. "Among the
products to be subject to tariff reductions, the average tariff rate
for over 2,000 industrial items will be lowered by only 0.25
percentage points, from the current 6.03 percent to 5.78 percent."</P>
      <P>Ho admitted that the imminent tariff cuts will have a greater
impact on domestic farmers as the average customs duty rate for
3,000-plus agricultural items will be slashed from the present 21
percent to 14 percent.</P>
      <P>As for traditional labor-intensive industries, Ho said, Taiwan
secured assurances during the WTO negotiations process to protect its
manufacturers in certain fields. For example, Taiwan is entitled, if
necessary, to impose a 5 percent flexible hike on its tariff rate for
ready-to-wear clothing. In addition, Taiwan will have a grace period
of up to three years to implement a zero tariff policy on paper pulp
and steel imports.</P>
      <P>Taiwan began to allow compact car imports in 1997. The quota for
compact car imports is set at 10,000 for 2002, with the tariff rate
to be lowered from the current 30 percent to 29 percent. "The impact
should be limited," Ho said. More than 9,900 foreign compact cars
entered the Taiwan market this year.</P>
      <P>In fact, Ho said, the market share of locally built automobiles
has increased to 80 percent from 60 percent recorded before Taiwan
opened its car market, thanks to domestic automakers' strenuous
efforts toward presenting vehicles with styles and options catering
especially to the tastes of local consumers.

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 31 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Turning to the service sector, Ho said, Taiwan has agreed to ease
restrictions on personnel and capital movements and use of land for
foreign investors in all service-related fields.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Ho said Republic of China nationals will still have
niches in the domestic service markets. Despite opening the market,
70 percent of radio and television programs as well as 20 percent of
cable TV programs must be produced in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>For educational services, Ho said, chairmen of the boards and
presidents of private schools must be ROC nationals and foreign
members of the boards of trustees should not exceed one-third of the
total. Although foreign advocates can from now on be partners of
local legal firms, only lawyers with official ROC licenses can handle
Taiwan-related legal cases.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, Minister of Finance Yen
Ching-chang echoed Ho's optimistic views about Taiwan's capabilities
to cope with the challenges that will come with membership in the
WTO.</P>
      <P>"During our 12-year struggle for WTO membership, local industries
have for the most part undergone restructuring and have adjusted
their business strategies in preparation for the challenges of more
open markets," Yen said, adding that he is convinced that most local
enterprises can withstand increased foreign competition in the wake
of WTO entry.</P>
      <P>As a matter of fact, Yen said, Taiwan companies would face new
tests and challenges because of economic globalization and
liberalization even if Taiwan had not been allowed to joint the WTO.</P>
      <P>Yen pointed out that the WTO has only just begun to put forward
regulations governing banking, insurance and securities services. To
pave the way for its WTO accession, he said, Taiwan has gradually
liberalized its financial service market since the mid-1980s. Over
the past year-and-a-half, Yen said, Taiwan has finalized legislation
of eight new statutes, including a merger law for financial
institutions and a law regarding financial holding companies to
facilitate restructuring and the rejuvenation of local financial
services.</P>
      <P>"My observation is that our local financial industry should have
no difficulties dealing with WTO entry challenges," Yen said
optimistically.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Yen said, Taiwan's financial institutions will be able
to branch out overseas under the WTO framework, breaking the current
restraints resulting from the Beijing-imposed diplomatic isolation of
the ROC.</P>
      <P>"Although foreign institutions may have more financial products
to offer, they must localize their products if they want to make a
true impact on the Taiwan market," Yen said, adding that some foreign
financial firms have forged strategic alliances with their local
counterparts in preparation for entering the Taiwan market and even
tapping the vast mainland Chinese market.</P>
      <P>As for the sharp price hike for "red-label" rice wine because of
WTO entry, Yen said this was the result of the Legislative Yuan's
resolution allowing the price to be fixed indefinitely because the
wine was considered a staple of every Chinese household, and should
not be subject to market forces.</P>
      <P>"Because of this, the price for "red-label" rice wine, which has
been selling for NT$21 per 0.6-liter bottle for the past two decades,
was distorted," Yen said, adding that the removal of the wine and
tobacco monopoly system following WTO entry will allow market forces
to determine the price of the wine in the future.</P>
      <P>Council of Agriculture (COA) Chairman Chen Hsi-huang has never
minced words on the WTO challenges for local farmers. With its small
farming system, Chen said, Taiwan need not join the WTO from the
viewpoint of agricultural development. "However, in this era of
globalization, agricultural production should be an integral part of
overall economic and social development."</P>
      <P>In the past, Chen said, Taiwan placed more emphasis on
agricultural production than on competitiveness and tended to offer
government subsidies to cope with foreign competition.</P>
      <P>In preparation for WTO entry, Chen said, Taiwan has set up
several import relief funds to help cushion the impact on local
farmers, as well as adjusting its agricultural development
strategies.</P>
      <P>"We still have significant leverage, including technological
expertise and capital, and we'll continue enjoying a competitive edge
in the sales of fresh vegetables and certain indigenous fruits," Chen
said, adding that with new packaging and marketing strategies, many
Taiwan-produced agricultural products can make their way into
overseas markets.

      <P>For instance, Chen said, Taiwan was able to export more than 20
containers of garlic to Canada and the United States for the first
time this year.</P>
      <P>Wu Jung-yi, director of the Taiwan Institute of Economic
Research, said he believes that Taiwan's farm produce will have a
certain competitiveness in the world market.</P>
      <P>"Nevertheless, it will still takes a while to adjust the strategy
and structure of the sector," Wu said. "With entrepreneurship and
technological innovation, I do not rule out the possibility that the
island's agricultural production will account for 10 percent of its
GDP in the future, as is the case currently in the Netherlands."</P>
      <P>As Taiwan's agricultural population is aging and has poor
adaptability, Wu said, the government should play an active role in
helping the farming sector adapt itself to the severe tests lying
ahead.</P>

      <P>The Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC) denied media reports Monday that Taiwan would not open its
market to mainland China immediately after its formal entry to the
World Trade Organization (WTO) Jan. 1, 2002.</P>
      <P>"The reports are not true," said Fu Don-cheng, director of the
MAC's Department of Economic Affairs. "On the contrary, the
government will actively promote exchanges across the Taiwan Strait
in the wake of our WTO accession."</P>
      <P>Media reports quoted unidentified senior government officials as
saying that Taiwan would not apply the same market-opening measures
to mainland China following its WTO accession in an attempt to force
Beijing to resume long-stalled cross-strait talks.</P>
      <P>"The reports far deviate from reality," Fu said, adding that the
MAC, which charts Taiwan's policy toward mainland China, would issue
a formal statement after discussing the issue with other relevant
government agencies.</P>
      <P>Mainland China became a formal WTO member earlier this month.
Under the WTO framework, mainland China would be entitled to demand
negotiations with Taiwan should the island impose discriminating

    <HEADLINE>JAPANESE FOREIGN MINISTER CRITICIZED FOR PRO-BEIJING REMARKS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Tokyo,  Dec. 31 (CNA)
(By Mike Chang and Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Japanese foreign minister must follow the
government's long-standing position calling for Taipei-Beijing issues
to be resolved through peaceful means, a Japanese ruling Liberal
Democratic Party (LDP) official said in a recent interview
criticizing Foreign Minister Makiko Tanaka's pro-Beijing remarks made
last Tuesday.</P>
      <P>LDP Secretary-General Taku Yamasaki said in an interview aired on
Fuji TV Sunday that diplomatic issues are very sensitive and should
not involve comments that interfere with another country's domestic
affairs.</P>
      <P>Tanaka said Tuesday that she was hopeful that the Taiwan issue
will turn out like Hong Kong in the future. The former British colony
reverted to mainland China in 1997 under a "one country, two systems"
formula.</P>
      <P>The outspoken minister's remarks drew immediate protests from the
Republic of China government and criticism from several major
Japanese media.</P>
      <P>Tokyo has traditionally refrained from taking sides on the Taiwan
issue.</P>
      <P>In a statement of protest, ROC representative to Japan Lo
Fu-chuan stressed that the Republic of China on Taiwan is a sovereign
nation whose future should be decided by its 23 million residents. He
also demanded that Tanaka should retract her pro-Beijing remarks.</P>
      <P>In an effort to clarify her comments, Tanaka explained at a news
conference last Friday that when she said she hoped Taiwan could turn
out like Hong Kong, she meant that the Hong Kong issue was resolved
peacefully, and that she hopes the Taiwan issue will also be resolved
through peaceful negotiations without the use of force.</P>
      <P>Tokyo switched its diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing
in 1972, when Tanaka's father was prime minister.</P>

    <HEADLINE>STUDENTS IN TAIWAN, MAINLAND DIFFER ON BEIJING'S USE OF FORCE: SURVEY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  31  (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>University students on both sides of the
Taiwan Strait differ sharply in their view of Beijing's possible use
of force against Taiwan, with 17 percent of those in Taiwan saying
the event was unlikely, whereas 52 percent of mainland students saw
it as a possiblity within 10 years, according to a survey released
Sunday.</P>
      <P>The poll was conducted by the National Chinese Congress of
Cultures, a non-profit organization.</P>
      <P>Dr. Kenneth Kuanling Fan, chairman of the organization, said that
the group polled 2,000 students from 20 universities in Taiwan and
another 400 from Peking University, Fudan University, Tsinghua
University and Jiaotong University in mainland China through
stratified random sampling from Dec. 17-29. A total of 1,741
responses from Taiwan and 232 from mainland China were received.</P>
      <P>Fan said that the students had different views about the future
development of cross-strait relations if agreement is not possible
between the two. While 56.27 percent of the Taiwanese students
believed that the status quo will remain, only 30.83 percent of the
mainland students shared the same view. Only 16.96 percent of the
Taiwanese students thought that Beijing would use force to take
Taiwan within 10 years, while 52.5 percent of the mainland students
believed that Beijing would resort to such action.</P>
      <P>In the long run, 45.04 percent of the students in Taiwan believe
the status quo can be maintained, but only 15.83 percent of the
mainland students said this was possible. Just over 23 percent of the
Taiwanese students see a future where the two sides of the Strait are
unified while 22.8 percent envisioned an independent Taiwan.</P>
      <P>However, more than half of the students who responded advocated
some sort of unification between Taiwan and mainland China on an
equal basis. Fifty-three percent of the Taiwanese students who
responded supported such a formula. There was 58.33 percent support
among the mainland students.</P>
      <P>Referring to the question of direct cross-strait links, 54.04
percent of the Taiwanese students and 54.17 percent of the mainland
students see it as being necessary.</P>
      <P>Students on both sides aknowledge that the investment environment
in mainland China is better than that of Taiwan. The survey results
show that 53.41 percent of the Taiwanese students and 65.83 percent
of the mainland students consider the investment environment in
mainland China more favorable.</P>
      <P>Since both Taiwan and mainland China have been admitted into the
World Trade Organization (WTO), most students on both sides believe
the authorities on both sides of the Strait will accelerate the
realization of direct trade, direct transportation and direct
investment. The survey showed that 55.98 percent of the Taiwanese
students are positive about the development, and 53.33 percent of the
mainland students have the same opinion.</P>
      <P>Regarding a conditioned liberalization of tourist visas for
mainland Chinese people, 76.38 percent of the Taiwanese students were
in support of the idea and 81.67 percent of the mainland students
welcomed such a decision.</P>
      <P>As for the "no haste, be patient" policy of the Taiwanese
authorities regarding investment in mainland China, only 23.45
percent of the Taiwanese students supported the continuation of the
policy, compared with 53.98 percent who were against it. Among the
mainland students, only 8.33 percent approved and 67.5 percent were
against.</P>
      <P>Dr. Fan said that it was the first time that the organization had
conducted a survey among university students on both sides of the
Taiwan Strait.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CYPRUS HOPES TO LURE YANGMING MARINE AND K SHIPPING TO ITS PORT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ankara, Dec. 31 (CNA)
(By Kuo Chuan-hsin and Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Cyprus port authorities are seeking to lure
the Taiwan-based Yangming Marine Transport Corp. to set up a
transshipment hub at its southern port of Limassol, a Cyprus
newspaper reported Monday.</P>
      <P>The Cyprus Post, citing a ranking official of the Cyprus Port
Administration, reported that port authorities are planning to invest
millions of U. S. dollars to upgrade and enhance the port's
facilities. The port is also planning to start 24-hour services in
the near future, it said.</P>
      <P>The daily newspaper said Yangming Marine, with seven ships and
another, "K shipping company" with 13 vessels, are targets of the
Cyprus Port Administration as part of its plan to establish a
transshipment center in Limassol in the Eastern Mediterranean.</P>
      <P>The official was also quoted as saying that both Yangming Marine
and K are keen to create a transshipment hub in the Middle East by
the coming spring. He also pointed out that the Cyprus port
authorities will hold a seminar early next year in London to attract
at least one of the two companies to ink a cooperation pact with it.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT CHEN PRESIDES OVER PROMOTION CEREMONY FOR NEW OFFICERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  31 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Monday that
military command and military administration will be integrated March
1, 2002 as part of the government's determination to streamline
national defense.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a senior military officers' promotion ceremony, Chen
said although local society still has different views about the
planned integration of the military command and administration, the
policy will not be subject to further changes.</P>
      <P>"I'm hopeful that all military servicemen will support the
program and work wholeheartedly to make it work," Chen urged.</P>
      <P>Currently, the military command structure runs directly from the
General Staff Headquarters (GSH) to the Presidential Office, while
matters of logistics are communicated between the GSH and the
Ministry of National Defense (MND).</P>
      <P>Under the new integration program, command will be taken care of
by the defense ministry.</P>
      <P>Noting that military nationalization is critical to the
development of democracy, Chen said he was pleased that the military
had maintained neutrality in the Dec. 1 elections for legislators and
local government chiefs.</P>
      <P>"This indicates that Taiwan's young democracy has gradually
matured and that party politics has gradually taken root on the
island," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Three ROC Army major generals were promoted to lieutenant
generals and 35 colonels in various military branches were promoted
to major generals in Monday' ceremony.</P>
      <P>President Chen said he took great pleasure in seeing Pan Ai-chu,
director of the Political Warfare Department under the MND's Military
Intelligence Bureau, become the Republic of China's first female
major general in more than three decades at Monday' ceremony.</P>
      <P>Chen said Pan's promotion shows the military's determination to
promote sex equality.</P>
